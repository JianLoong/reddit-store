I've been dating my boyfriend for about a year, he does live at home with both of his parents. We are both in our early 30s, and it is a bit uncomfortable with dating since he lives at home, but financially he's saving a lot of money and with today's market, it  makes sense. However, the past few months I've been coming over 2 to 3 times a week to his parents house around dinner time and to sleepover. Every night, my boyfriend's mother makes dinner for everybody. She can get kind of cranky and irritable, so we all just try to give her her own space in the kitchen. But whenever she asks for my help, I always give her whatever assistance she may need. I also do whatever tasks she wants around the house, including sweeping/cleaning the floors, cleaning up the kitchen and the dishes after dinner, buying things outside of the home that she may need/asks for, pickup up her vegetable/fruit COOP at the local farm when she's out of town. \n\nOver Thanksgiving day weekend, my boyfriend asked his parents if I could sleep over Saturday night. His parents stated they  didn't want me to sleep over that night, so I did get kind of sad, but I went home and he slept over my place that night. But after I left that night (and before my bf came to my place), they got in a heated fight about it all. His mom stated, \"she shows up right at dinner and we feel Ike she's free loading. She doesn't offer to help out or help out while I'm cooking. She doesn't help prepare the food with me.\" While his dad said, \"I don't like having her here because it feels like i can't be comfortable when she around.\" \n\nMy boyfriend said he did defend me during this argument with his parents. He said that he listed off things of how I helped her in past instances, and gave examples of how I always clean up the kitchen, and I always do everything she asks of me.\n\nBut what hurt my feelings is that my bf wants me to, \"give a little bit more and help out more just so she shuts up about it.\"\n\nBut I find that insulting bc I've done nothing wrong!!  \n\nAITAH for feeling insulted that I need to change? I feel like they are the ones who need to change and apologize. I'm just looking for some unbiased opinions about this whole situation. Thank you!\n\nEDIT: This has been tough to read, but thank you everyone for the constructive feedback. Time to take a good hard look in the mirror. I need to stop spending time at his parents house, as I've outworn my welcome. Depression can be hard to navigate, so I've been spending time at his parents home because it feels \"homey.\"  I need to stay at my own home, and if my bf wants to spend time together we can hang out here. Also, I just want to note- every time I go to his parents house, I always make sure that we get the mothers approval. My boyfriend and I text and coordinate with his mom that it's OK that I come over and spend the night and have dinner with them.

Youre just making yourself look bad and lazy.", "YTA, and your boyfriend is too.\n\nHe is dating you. His parents are not dating you. \n\nBfs and gfs love being around each other because they get affection from the experience and are are giving and accommodating to each other as a result. That\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to work. \n\nExcept both of you have outsourced the giving and accommodating part to his parents, and are only reaping the affection. Which they don\u2019t get to share. You might all like each other, but that\u2019s not the same thing.\n\nWhether you\u2019re helping or not, it\u2019s clearly not enough to make up for all that they\u2019re giving and all that you\u2019re taking, or they wouldn\u2019t be upset. Part of that might be projection because your bf should be helping a lot more and they can\u2019t understand that that\u2019s a source of their frustration. \n\nAnd that\u2019s my last point. Your bf isn\u2019t helping his parents, he\u2019s asking you to make up the difference, he\u2019s constantly stomping all over their boundaries by having someone over, he\u2019s unwilling to make a life with you if it inconveniences him in any way (a slightly longer commute is a dealbreaker?) and he is showing no signs of change or progression. This is not a man. This is a selfish, mooching child.

I am a parent of adult kids, they all live on their own, none are in their 30s yet.  I understand the reasons you say, but his parents may be ready to have their home to themselves.  I am ready for my kids to move when they can.  I do not tell them they have to, but I know how I feel in my thoughts.  He needs to launch. I was happy when my last child moved to his new home.  I don't know how to judge this; I would be annoyed if my 30 something son's girlfriend came to stay also.  \n\nMy daughter did have her boyfriend live with us for a while (he was only 18 at the time), and it did drive me crazy, but I am good at masking my feelings.  Thankfully they are now happily in an apartment of their own.", "YTA. You both are way too old to be using his parent's home like that and they are likely very uncomfortable with it.", "Ok. Wow. I don't even know what to say here. This sounds as though it were written by a 16 year old, not a 30 year old. \n\nFirst off, yes, YTA but so is your boyfriend. You two are adults and you're invading the space of another adult couple who probably never envisioned having their 30-some year old child living with them. \n\n**BOTH** you and your bf need to be helping out if you're going to be staying at his parent's house and using their resources!!! Don't just show up at dinner to eat and stay the night. If you're going over, call to see if you can pick anything up, does anyone need anything? Show up early enough to help make the dinner (and you and your bf *absolutely* need to be contributing with groceries or money towards the food bill) and help clean it up afterwards, as well. That means cleaning not only the dishes but the kitchen, as well. If you spend time in common areas while you're there then you should be helping to keep those areas clean and organized. \n\nTreat their house as you'd hope someone would treat yours as a guest. Just because they're his parents doesn't mean they want him living there anymore, which means they don't need to be dealing with girlfriends sleeping over.

Why?", "Was a hard one to decide between ESH but you and your bf are the AH.\n\nYou go over at your bf 2 to 3 in a week and most likely it\u2019s probably 3 times a week. So half the week you stay over at their and they provide you food. It\u2019s their house and well you make them comfortable coming over so much and while you mayb help out, it\u2019s a tad unknown how much given it\u2019s your view point.\n\nYour bf also sucks because as a grown man, he gets his gf over to sleep at his parents half the week. Plus I get it\u2019s their house but having to ask permission should really be a turn off for u.

We are both in our early 30s, and it is a bit uncomfortable with dating since he lives at home, but financially he's saving a lot of money and with today's market, it  makes sense.

No shade, but I can\u2019t imagine continuously sleeping over someone\u2019s parent\u2019s house at 30, when I have my own home. \n\nAnd they suck for letting it get this far. You may not be a \u201cfreeloader\u201d but they are not wrong that you continuously showing up for dinner and spending the night, so much so that they need to tell you no, means they probably don\u2019t get much time by themselves. \n\nThey may have signed up to support your bf for however long, but *you* do not need to be there all the time.", "NTA you are already doing so much to help!  And you have only been dating a year and don't live there, what more are they expecting?  Why can't bf and dad help out?

Why not ask him to help cook??)\n\nBut the real issue here is the boyfriend. When you go over to a boyfriend/girlfriend\u2019s place, until you live there or you\u2019re staying there all the time, it\u2019s normal to not cook or clean or do chores. You have your own home where you do that. The issue here is that your boyfriend is not doing HIS fair share of cooking and cleaning and helping out at the place where HE lives. If that means HE needs to do extra because he\u2019s also bringing someone around, that\u2019s actually not that weird in any roommate living situation, parents or no. The problem is he\u2019s exploiting the fact that he\u2019s living with his parents to not pull his weight in the shared living situation, and OP is just an add-on to that more important problem.\n\nYour boyfriend should come to your place more often and you should go over to his parents\u2019 house way less. That\u2019s the solution. If spending time at your boyfriend\u2019s parents\u2019 place is important to you, then *after* you\u2019ve established your new normal, it would be reasonable to share with his parents that although you\u2019ll continue to spend most of your time with bf at your place, it was very kind of them to allow you to spend so much time at their house in the past, and the homey atmosphere helped you through a rough time. Then maybe they\u2019ll start inviting you over a couple times a month so you can still get the homey vibe without being treated as anything other that what you are, which is their son\u2019s houseguest, NOT a member of the family who needs to pull her own weight.", "YTA.\n\nI get not wanting to stay at your own empty house and wanting to be in the same space as your partner but it's not just about the two of you if he's living with his parents.

I go over once a week for dinner and WE buy dinner for his mom (his dad's on a feeding tube) whenever I do because we are both grown and can get/afford our own food and she doesn't need to be spending her money on us like that.

Of course it's annoying.\n\nHere's the thing. If you had a friend come live with YOU at your house for a year or so to save money, and you agreed that obviously they could have guests there sometimes because why not it's their house too- BUT then they have a guest that basically moved in - shows up nearly every day to share dinner and hang out all night and spend the night most of the time. This \"bonus\" roomate doesn't pay bills or rent, doesn't buy groceries. They may be helpful and kind, but they are around ALL THE TIME. And it goes on for months and months. You can't get rid of them. You're starting to get resentful of providing dinner every night even though you used to not mind. Did you adopt another kid? IT's endless. The guest is ALWAYS THERE. You start to resent additional clearning and the lack of privacy. How would you feel? I will tell you - it would suck, You can't feel comfortable in your own home because there is ALWAYS A GUEST.  YOu would hate it. They hate it. This is all normal. It's annoying to have a full time guest in your home all the time, it's sometimes hard to articulate exactly why,, but everyone knows you can't relax the same way in your home when you have houseguests. Maybe his dad just wants to come home and relax in the living room sometimes without you in their house. Like anyone would. This is his parent's reality every damn day, so yeah - they have a right to be annoyed.\n\nThey worked hard and have a home. They are trying to help out their son, but he is using their home as if it's his and it is not. He can stay there, he can live there, you can visit occasionally, but he should not have his girlfiend over every damn day spending hours hanging out, and spending the night all the time.

Apparently, OP's semi in-laws aren't as sociable and want more private time or don't like her that well.\n\nHowever, OP did everything she could to read the room previously - she stayed out of the way as a default because she got the vibe that unsolicited help was getting in the way, and she eagerly helped whenever she was asked to. She made her decisions on how often to be there based on what her boyfriend told her. She did her best to not be a drag given the situation and the signals she got about what was appreciated. The problem is that the boyfriend, who knows his parents much better and is around them almost 100% of the time, didn't pick up that there was a disjunct before it became an active argument and is seemingly doing a lot of freeloading himself. (Based on the fact that his help wasn't mentioned anywhere in the post.)\n\nThe solution is for OP to not go over so frequently because apparently her boyfriend can't mediate, unless she's willing and it seems worthwhile to have a direct conversation over the boyfriend's head.

It's the boyfriend who should have been able to read both sides and prevent the misunderstanding from happening, but as you say, it may be that his personal interest was just to let it go as far as it could be tolerated.", "I don't think it's weird at all that I go to their house 2 to 3 times a week for dinner? I think if he lived alone, it wouldn't be an issue at all, it's just that he lives with his parents.", "Yeah, I think that's a big part of it. It's just hard because we live in a very expensive area, and houses are basically nonexistent under $500,000. He still getting started in his career, and I've tried to be really patient with him. It's just so hard because his mom does his laundry, cooks, three meals for him a day, and he doesn't have to really do anything.so I just look at his lifestyle and it makes me really uneasily and unsettled. But when I try to bring this all up, he just gets defensive. But other than all of these things with his lifestyle, he's like a perfect partner for me. He's caring, understanding, attraction is there, we have a ton of hobbies in common, and I think we have a really healthy communication style when we are outside the house. But the key is that we need to be outside of his parents house!, I just feel like whenever we are there we revert to being teenagers, and it feels so unhealthy.", "As a person with children in their early-thirties, the part that would bother me is just you being there so frequently. You could be the nicest person in the world but my house is my refuge. I agree with the father, I just can't relax if guests are there.", "I've been cooped up at my house when I was remotely working. Then I lost my job, and because I'm home all the time alone it's nice to get a change of scenery.", "I missed that on first read.  That's hilarious actually, this can't be real.", "or spending the night 2 or 3 times a week?", "My 12 year old has more awareness than the OP. It\u2019s incredible.", "Maybe you missed reading this part:\n\n> But whenever she asks for my help, I always give her whatever assistance she may need. I also do whatever tasks she wants around the house, including sweeping/cleaning the floors, cleaning up the kitchen and the dishes after dinner, buying things outside of the home that she may need/asks for, pickup up her vegetable/fruit COOP at the local farm when she's out of town.", "Yeah; I knew something was up when OP talked about giving mom her \u201cspace\u201d while she was making dinner for the whole family plus one.", "Yeah, I think you make a good point. I don't think I was being an asshole, because I was helping out around the house, and I did anything that was asked of me. But, unfortunately, I think I just wasn't mindful enough or aware enough that I was over too much and then I was encroaching on their home. I think I do need to spend way less time at their home, and only come over when explicitly invited.I think maybe I should only go over for dinner like maybe once a month if I am invited.\n\nI think that his mom has tried to communicate to him that she wants him to spend less time and at their house. She's voice to me and to him saying, \"why don't you spend Friday Saturday and Sunday at your gfs apartment?\" But I think what ends up happening is that my boyfriend ends up getting defensive, and replies with aggression and \"shut the fuck up!\"  Idk it's all really messed up and I can see everyone's perspectives. I just want my bf to be independent and live by himself like an adult.", "Yeah, that's what I thought too. Last night when he told me just to, \"give more\" just to appease his mom, I got really upset and told him to leave my apartment. He just kind of ignored me and didn't apologize, and I literally had to force him out of my apartment. I think that I absolutely have outstay my welcome, and I haven't been very thankful or gracious towards his parents, I think that's totally true. But I also think that it's messed up that my boyfriend put it on me that I need to give more back, and I need to make more of an effort towards his parents. When the reality is that he needs to move out.\n\nEdit: sentence wording", "I don't really see it that way. I see it as wanting to spend time with my boyfriend 2 to 3 times a week, which I think is healthy and normal. But what makes it weird is that he lives at home with his parents. So we end up spending all this time together, and now it's awkward and uncomfortable.", "Thank you! I feel like I try to get him to come to my apartment, but during the week I feel like it's pulling teeth. He says that by the time he gets home and he takes a shower and he gets settled, he's tired and he doesn't want to make the commute. It's just getting really annoying and frustrating, because I want my partner to make the effort to want to see me and spend time with me. But because I don't have a job right now and I'm not working, I have all this energy and free time. So he kinda uses it to say well why don't you come to my parents house and spend time with me. After all, he has been working all day and he is tired. So it's kind of the sticky situation. So I'm having a hard time standing my ground and saying, \"no, you need to come visit me!\"", "Yeah, when I started dating him his lifestyle was really troubling to me, and I almost dumped him after a month of dating. But he's been so kind and caring and understanding of my situation, especially because I struggle with anxiety and depression. Plus I lost my job a few months. So I've been More understanding of the situation than usual, just because I'm at such a low point in my life.\n\nHes 31 years old and he's never lived on his own. He went to college and he got an associates degree, but he's been dragging his feet about getting the license that he needs in his blue-collar profession. I've been the fire under his ass (he's told me he appreciates the motivation I give him) to get his license, and to start to make more money, but I think if it wasn't for me, he wouldn't be doing it. it's just really frustrating all around, because I went to college and I have 3 college degrees and I make pretty decent money. But when I lost my job this past summer, my self-esteem in my self-worth took a nose dive, and I just feel like I can't do any better in the dating world. \n\nPlus, he's been really patient with me and he understands me. I've had a lot of boyfriends that just don't understand or get what my symptoms are regarding my mental health. so I'm kind of at a loss of what to do. I see a lot of potential in him I think he would be an amazing husband, and he does help out around his parents house with helping make food and make dinner and take care of yardwork, but it does worry that he doesn't do his own laundry and that he doesn't make three meals a day for himself. Those are like basic human things that an adult does an a daily basis, and he does not do them.so when he tells me he's tired, he doesn't feel like making the drive to my apartment, that's when I get fed up and then we start fight and I tell him that I can't do this if he's not willing to make the drive to see me.", "Yeah, that's a really good point, I never really thought about it. Im just over at their house so often spending time there and using their resources, that when she asks me to do things like go to the co-op or pick up things outside of the home I immediately do that, because I feel a lot of guilt and shame for, you know being there so much. But yeah, my boyfriend's dad does not lift a finger when he's at the house. He does work full-time as an engineer, and he makes good money, but I still think that it's so weird that me and my boyfriend contribute and help out more around dinner and at the house than his own father. It's kind of an old fashioned 1950s dynamic at the house if you know what I mean.", "This, the OP post is about their interaction with bf's parents of course, but the key person is the bf, who has only asked whether OP can help out more  \n\n\nHas bf talked to his parents about having OP over several times a week? Are they doing more to make up for the fact that their parents have less time to themselves and feel like they are being taken advantage of (feeding gf 2-3 times a week)  \n\n\nA key detail for me is that bf could stay at OPs but doesn't want to because of the commute. That's a pretty strong signal that spending time with his gf isn't that important unless gf goes to his house.

Like I do little things around the house for her, and I just try to make sure it's clean as possible. But I do think that I have out stayed my welcome, I do realize that now!! But I do think that it's odd and a bit frustrating that my boyfriend thinks I need to \"Give more \"or \"help out a little bit more.\" I think the reality is that everybody's really frustrated that we're in this situation in general, and I think he just needs to think about moving out soon.", "Yeah, that's the thing, I think it's totally normal to want to spend a few nights a week with your partner after you've been dating for a year.

It wouldn't be weird if it were welcome, but it's obviously not. Some people will be ok sharing their home in that way, and some will not. Your boyfriend can't have his cake and eat it too. If he wants the financial assistance of being dependent, he doesn't have the freedom that living on his own would provide.", "Yes, it is weird. It's his parents' house and they did not invite you.", "That is obviously too much. It is not like he lives alone. You are both grown ass people. Eating with his parents that many times a week is a bit much. It is beyond obvious that they don't like it either. Be a big girl and make your own dinner.", "it is that he lives with his parents, yes. and if he lived with someone else, he would be paying for part of the dinner, or all of it. adult roommates don\u2019t necessarily cook for each other. when you date someone who lives with ther parents, it is to some level expected that you will spend most of your time at your place, just as, if you were dating someone with no roommates, if you had roommates you\u2019d spend most of your time at their place. you can\u2019t act like he lives alone when he doesn\u2019t. make him come to you, instead of going to his parent\u2019s place. how that plays out should tell you a lot about his parents, and about him.", "Do they invite you", "why do you want to hang at his parents house so bad? no! cut it off. this whole situation is unhealthy. you are an adult with your own place. respect yourself.", "Unless they explicitly invite you over for dinner 2-3 times a week, it's not just weird, it's incredibly rude. How did you get to be in your 30s and not understand that you don't just invite yourself to someone else's home for dinner that they made? If your boyfriend was the one buying the groceries and cooking, then that would be one thing. But it sounds like his mom does everything. Grow up.", "The problem isn't just that he's living at home; it's that he's not being an independent adult at all. He's a 30 year old man who can't do his own laundry or even prepare one meal a day for himself. You feel like teenagers at his parents' house because he's behaving like a teenager. No, in fact many teenagers do their own laundry and help with cooking while living at home, so it's a massive red flag that your boyfriend does not. Don't move in with him; you'll just end up as his mommy bangmaid.\n\nIf the only reason he's living at home is to save money, then he should be splitting household chores with his parents equitably like a proper housemate. My 19yo brother is living at home while in uni and he does far more chores than your 30yo boyfriend. Why is he not embarrassed that he still lives this way?", "LOL \n\n1.  His mom and dad are probably truly over HIS freeloading but you're the easier target.  They're probably hoping he'll take a hint though (he won't).\n2.  Please notice that when his parents complained he asked YOU to do more, he didn't offer to do anything himself even though he's the biggest mooch in this situation.", "Honey, I am usually not the person to tell a stranger to end their relationship, but how a man treats his mother is a good indication of how he will treat his spouse. You will wind up doing all of his cooking, cleaning, and laundry as well. He does not sound like he is ready to grow up and that doesn\u2019t magically change by moving in together.\n\nThis has me worried for you.", ">But other than all of these things with his lifestyle, he's like a perfect partner for me. He's caring, understanding, attraction is there, we have a ton of hobbies in common, and I think we have a really healthy communication style when we are outside the house.\n\nYeah - I get what your saying, but - are you sure this isn't just because he's a grown man being absolutely cradled by his parents. I'm 29 - I can't stand being at my parents for more than a few weeks. The lack of independence drives me crazy.\n\nHe's clearly dramatically less stressed than a normal 30 year old is - he doesn't have to manage his affairs. His relationship with his own life is not 100% - he relies upon the support of his parents. If he was stressed about paying rent, having to cook, clean, pay bills etc, would he still be this perfect BF?\n\nKind of worried about what your saying, if I'm honest.", "This man is not at all prepared (or preparing) to be a good partner. \n\nLook at what you just said- you are unsettled and OTHER THAN HIS LIFESTYLE he\u2019s a good partner.\n\nYikes! Lifestyle is a huge part of compatibility. You\u2019ve basically got attraction, common interests, lifestyle, and ethics/moral outlook.\n\nAnd frankly only a few interests need to overlap.\n\nYou need a lifestyle match. Trust this.", "I agree with the dad too. At the end of the day, I want to be able to put on comfy clothes and veg out on the couch if I feel like it. I always feel like I have to be \u201con\u201d when I have guests over. OP is there 2/3 nights a week and that\u2019d be way too much for me. Especially, on a week night.", "I completely agree.", "Yes. I don\u2019t think this is about \u201chelping out more\u201d at all. I think the parents are done with both of them and want their house back.", "Then go on a walk. Hang out at a coffee shop or bookstore. Go to the gym. Do some window shopping. Literally ANYTHING except inviting yourself to someone else's home 2-3 times a week. Good grief.", "Then perhaps you guys can go for walks or a drive or something. Seems to me your going there is causing increasing problems that could be completely avoidable. Can't you and he get groceries, make dinner together and have a lovely evening? Hey! You could go one step further, try to make amends in this situation not only by putting a stop to your (intended or not) freeloading and INVITE THEM TO DINE AT YOUR PLACE!\n\nYour defense sound like a spoiled child. When you two are married and living in a house and you're \"stuck at home all day\" will you go to his parents for dinner and what not? Or will you then go on to live the second half of your day in your home as well? Do you see what I'm getting at here?", "So?", "A lot of people had to be cooped up during lock down and they had to make do. And just because you\u2019re home alone all the time does not give you the right to infringe on your BFs parents home.", "Staying 2 to 3 days a week and contributing zero towards buying/ preparing the food.", "A few apples from the market and a swept floor is no replacement for being able to call your home and your time your own.", "She shouldn't need to be asked for help when she's living there half the week. And either should her bf.", "When you\u2019re asked to help, it\u2019s not helping. She needs to stop being a freeloader", "I would be that mom in the kitchen slamming pots and pans down on the stove and letting go of cupboard doors so they didn\u2019t close quietly. \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnd the whole time mumbling to myself about the damn grocery budget going out the window and how I didn\u2019t sign up for another damn kid to feed and be in my space. I\u2019m sure OP, the bf AND the husband would give me a very wide berth!!\ud83d\ude02", "I would like for you to look at how he reacted to her suggestion- that\u2019s not healthy. Is he in therapy?", "He aggressively tells his mom to STFU? This is not a good son or boyfriend.", "Telling his mom, the same person who cooks all his means and cleans all his clothes, to shut the fuck up because she made a simple and reasonable suggestion is an enormous red flag that you absolutely should not be ignoring.\n\nIt is not a far leap in logic to think that he will treat you the same way if you two move in together. He\u2019s showing you how he treats the people he loves and who care for him. The fact his mom allows him to treat her this way is also a bad sign. He thinks it\u2019s normal to speak to people this way, or maybe just okay to speak to women this way.", "So you had to force him to leave your apartment after telling him to go cause you needed space cause he just ignored you and didn't apologize. His mom has likely said something to him before this and he had the same reaction to her he just did to you. The only reason your probably hearing about it now is because she told him she will say something next time you visit. That's the teenager like situation and responses your bf has in life. You really need to take some time to think if this is the kind of partner you want.", "it doesn\u2019t matter if you see it that way you\u2019re extremely rude and entitled, you\u2019re intruding on people and are being a burden in their lives. how do you just continue to go knowing that these people don\u2019t want you around, aren\u2019t you embarrassed?\n\nAlso, do you provide them with money or food for the dinners they cook for you? i don\u2019t care if you clean i\u2019m asking if you contribute financially or if you\u2019re just greedy and rude.\n\n\nAND THIS IS NOT YOUR BOYFRIEND\u2019S HOME", "There are plenty of ways to spend time together that don't involve his parents home. Maybe you guys should try 'dating' more. Although it speaks volumes that he won't come the half hour to you. But if you are dead set on this guy then you should both be making compromises to spend time together that doesn't infringe on anyone else's space or privacy.", "He's never lived on his own, though. He also doesn't do his own laundry or cook his own meals. He should have plenty of money saved up by now to move out, even if he has to get some roommates.", ">Have you looked at housing prices, and the general cost of living?\n\nWho cares.  they are double dating mommy and daddy. Go be poor somewhere lol", "They don\u2019t want you to be there either. It sounds like your *boyfriend* needs to put more effort into seeing you. You going over to his parents house seems to be inconveniencing everyone else including you.", "Your bf is a taker. He takes from his parents, and he takes from you.", "It is completely normal to want to spend time with your partner during the week regardless of how long you have been dating and you don\u2019t live together but what isn\u2019t normal is when your partner is in his early 30\u2019s and rather than be alone with you at your apartment( having to get up half an hour earlier) he would prefer you to spend the night at his parents house??? It\u2019s one thing to allow your spoilt entitled child to live at home longer than necessary because they love him, it\u2019s quite another thing to have his equally mature girlfriend who has her own apartment to rock up 2-3 times a week and be expect the same treatment! Who do you think he expects to take over from his mother eventually? Probably won\u2019t be you I\u2019m afraid because he doesn\u2019t have any concern for your feelings, they are not negotiable and if you want to see him during the week you need to come to him.  Even if the reason he gives you for why he won\u2019t stay at your place is pathetic and obnoxious seems selfish you allow it", "Could you maybe just stay on his room and bring your own food or eat first? Or he could propose that you guys cook together a night or two per week. This really is an issue for him to resolve with his parents and when you help, it should always be both of you together", "$55,000 is an incredible down payment and cushion. Obviously, he will not be able to save as much while renting, but he\u2019s ahead of the game. With proper budgeting, he  can still continue to build his down payment. \n\nIt\u2019s time to move out. PERIOD.", "You\u2019d be best to cook something for them for dinner, and then leave it for them to enjoy by themselves.", "This is not great advice at all! Well maybe about giving them some kind of gift, tbh I'd have taken something most times I was over there but I don't think they dislike you necessarily, just that they are over the expectations you and their son have and want their space back. You say his mum is moody but also that you are struggling with depression. I bet there are times you aren't great company either. Your boyfriend should be making more of an effort for both the women in his life in my opinion. Seriously though until its made very very clear they don't like you I wouldn't be taking this to heart because I honestly don't think that's truly the case. You and your boyfriend have been treating his parents home like its his place all this time or worse still that you are both teenagers unable to even sort your own meals out. Have you ever offered to cook or get a meal in? It's good you recognise you've over stayed your welcome but I think what they said speaks to their own son stepping on their toes and overstaying his too. You are getting all of this second hand so try and take a deep breath and look at the situation without emotion. You'll have better perspective that way.", "OP please listen to this", "You're 1000% correct. I brought it up several time with him about him either living with roommates or living on his own before we move in together in the future. But when I bring this up, he just says that he doesn't wanna have to waste $1000 a month on rent living in an apartment. He would rather spend that money towards saving a down payment for a house in the future. And I get that, I understand that, especially with the housing market the way it is. But he has no autonomy, and he's never had to take care of himself! And that's not OK! And when I say all this to him, he just gets defensive, and he shuts down and he doesn't talk to me and it turns into a big fight. And then I feel like I'm the asshole and I have to apologize.", "INFO\n\nHas he ever lived on his own. We need to know", "Agree 100%. I made that mistake, got married to someone who went from his parents house to our apartment and never learned to live alone. So frustrating as he had no idea how to do ANYTHING.", "She has overstayed her welcome but this is her boyfriend's fault. He sounds like he could afford his own place but he prefers to live with his parents. That's fine but he can't carry on like a teen in his first relationship.", "Right? Like if they were teenagers or in their early 20s this would be a pretty standard situation. But they\u2019re both fully grown-ass adults, and expectations for contribution are going to be a lot higher if she\u2019s over that much.", "I can see their point. Eating there a couple of times a month maybe but it sounds like he is freeloading.", "If he is saving so much money he should at least be able to spring for dinner at McDonalds.", "Hey thanks for your insight. Yeah, I think you're right, I'm not gonna go over from now on, unless they explicitly invite me. I think this is just been such a huge headache and so much drama. I think they just want their own house back, which is completely understandable! I would feel the same way!", "They honestly don't sound miserable to me. Would you want company over to your house 2-3 times a week for dinner and a sleep-over *that you didn't invite*? It's wearing on them, which is totally understandable.", "I can understand their frustrations tho. It's bad enough having to cook for your adult 30 yr child each night but now you have to cook for a 4th person because his gf comes over half the week and you can even be comfortable and the father can't even relax how he wants becuz every week there is company spending the night", "This is EXACTLY it. They\u2019re not tired of you being there they\u2019re tired of him living there and took their frustrations out on you. NTA but keep your distance from them for a while. Dine at restaurants, picnic in the park for changes in scenery.", "Even with the invite I\u2019d decline \u201cNo thanks, I wouldn\u2019t want your dad to feel like he can\u2019t be comfortable because I\u2019m there.\u201d", "My thoughts exactly", ">a house full of ingrates\n\nHow are they ingrates? It sounds to me like OP has severely overstayed their welcome. Sure, they've helped out, but we're still talking about someone who doesn't live there inviting themselves for dinner 2-3 times a week and staying overnight. It seems like OP is a bit of an ingrate.", "Ingrates? She spends multiple nights a week there. Forget helping out after dinner, she should be paying rent.", "Ingrates? Really ingrates? Why should the parents be thankfull to op? She is coming to their house, eating their food and sleeping in their house! She only cleans if she is asked to, never offers help by herself, because the mother needs time for herself in the kitchen \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12 and occasionally buys some veggies, but also only if she is asked to, never by herself. Op is an asshole big time", "70 minutes, assuming he drives there and back.", "Meanwhile, count up the amount of time that his mom spends thinking of meals, shopping for them, prepping, cooking, and cleaning up. How is he going to do that in the future if he can't spend an extra 35 minutes to drive? His solution to his parents having a problem with both of them is to only blame OP and ask her to do even more. His \"solutions\" to problems don't seem to involve him doing anything.", "It's not like he's choosing one over the other, they have found the work around by OP staying with him instead? Dunno why you have to be so patronizing and wrong...", "Eh, depends on where they live. I live in Rhode Island, a very tiny state that you can cross in an hour. I moved here over 15 years ago after getting out of the military (I\u2019m from the South). \n\nIt shocked me that any trip over 15 minutes and people complain. They recognize how silly it is, and even joke about \u201chaving to pack a lunch\u201d when traveling over 15 minutes, but they still all dislike \u201clonger\u201d trips. \n\nTo clarify, I agree with you that 30 minutes isn\u2019t too long, but in some places for people it is.", "Ugh! See when you say it like that I feel bad \ud83d\ude48. The thing is, I'm out of work right now, so I don't have anything to do all day. He's the one who's working full-time, so when he complains about adding minutes to his commute, I'm willing to be flexible and bend a little. But now I understand that it's not that big of a deal for him to commute a little bit more.", "She also said her apartment is small and they like hanging out in a big house \ud83d\ude44 they\u2019re fucking squatters lol. How are you not embarrassed for your life and soul acting like this in your 30s", "Checks out that he can\u2019t be bothered \ud83d\ude05 he\u2019s making his laziness everyone else\u2019s problem, especially his poor parents. They need to have some boundaries and tell him to move tf out.", "Then...yeah. If she doesn't want to end the relationship that's fine, but she shouldn't be crashing these people's home three times a week for a free meal.\n\n>I feel like they are the ones who need to change and apologize\n\nHonestly, I was done with OP after this one sentence alone. The nerve of some people.", "don't forget that he makes his mom cook dinner for him every night, and makes his gf clean up afterwards.", "OP, do NOT rush to move in with this man. His mom does all his cooking and cleaning. Would you expect him to split these chores with you if he moved in? PFFT. Good news, his mom is off your back, becuase you're his new mom! Have fun folding his undies.", "The boyfriend has it made (from his point of view). The bang maid while living rent free at his parents house.", "Well Oo lives in a tiny apt and has no job so they are actually well suited bc she\u2019ll prob have to move out doon", "in today's market..this is not as unusual as you'd think - especially in much of Europe...people stay at home until they marry.", "Yes, this is what I think. It's funny, once we hit our one-year anniversary. A few of his friends asked, \"when are we going to move in together?\" And I think my boyfriend wants to move in, but I've told him a few different times, that I think he needs to live on his own, whether it be with roommates, or has his own apartment, before we move in together. He needs to live on his own for six to 12 months and see what it feels like to make his own meals, do his own laundry, clean his own apartment. Because I think if we go straight from him living with his parents to me, he's not gonna know how to fend for himself", "I had the same experience! Dated a guy 4 years solder but he\u2019d never moved out and I had, we moved in together and I was expected to be his new mummy. For 2.5 years I begged him to do anything at all around the house and he didn\u2019t do a thing. Didn\u2019t even make his own sandwiches for work! Never cleaned a dish or did any cooking at all. Refused to buy groceries but also wouldn\u2019t pay me his half for the food. So glad I got out of that situation!", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d", "Yeah, you're right. In the past nine months, I've tried really hard to get him to come to my apartment and have dinner at my place and spend time here. But he tells me things like, \"your bed is really uncomfortable. I don't like your mattress it hurts my back \"or \"it adds 35 minutes to my commute in the morning to work.\" Also, I lost my job a couple of months ago, so I'm not working. He is working full-time, so I've been the one bending, and being flexible with whatever he wants to do with sleepovers. Which I thought was reasonable, but now I'm starting to realize that his parents and myself are super uncomfortable with a set up and it's not healthy. So I don't know, I do think that we should spend more time at my apartment and have more independence. I felt that way for the duration of our relationship for the past year, but it's just when he tells me these things it makes me question myself, and be like OK I get what he means", "They stay together, they don't live together.  Right now his parents still pay the bills and mommy cleans and makes dinner.  The dynamic will change radically if they switch to equal partners in their own place.  \n\nIf they weren't behaving like super old teenagers I'd agree with you.", "I guess it didn't dawn on OP that bringing a bag of groceries with her once or twice a week wouldn't hurt either, but I guess she didn't think of them - only herself and her bf.", "My situation was an *example* showing that you don't need to start from square one thinking that her spending a lot of time there is weird. A lot of comments are saying \"why the fuck would you spend so much time at the parents you're in your 30s,\" but it's different in different families, and she judged the situation as well as she could relying on her boyfriend who knows his family best.", "THANK YOU! This is it!! How dare he ask HER to do more, while doing nothing", "Ya I've thought that say thought myself!!! When we're out in public, and he meets my family and friends, he's so empathetic and kind and caring. But he doesn't have all his stressors in his life, like paying rent, paying a car payment, making three meals a day for himself, cleaning the bathroom, cleaning the kitchen. And it just makes me really worried that he's not Able to carry the load of being an adult. I've been living on my own since I graduated college in 2017, and it kind of sucks being an adult but you have to learn to do it. And he just hasn't gone through those milestones yet. Which makes me think he's very immature for his age, and makes me skeptical of his ability to be a partner", "Yeah, I don't know what I'm gonna do. I feel like I need an apology from him and I need him to step it up and be an adult and think about moving out of his parents place. I've brought it up several times about him moving out and living with roommates, but he always gets super defensive and doesn't wanna talk about it. He says he doesn't wanna waste $1000 a month living in an apartment, when he could be saving that money to buy a house down the road. But with interest rates being so high along with housing price is being so high, I can't keep doing this with him for the next few years. He needs to be an adult and live on his own for this to work between us. But every time I tell him all this, he just gets defensive and he shuts down. So I have no idea what to do.", "You're right, thanks", "OP, I know there is a lot more to your BF than this comment, but you do see the big flags flying in it don't you?..... \n\n>And when I say all this to him, he just gets defensive, and he shuts down and he doesn't talk to me and it turns into a big fight\n\nThis is your future, he has little to no communication skills... and tbf he has no life skills, he has a rough road ahead, are you SURE you want to be his passenger (mommy 2.0) for the duration??", "I get what you're saying about rent, but his communication skills are garbage.  Also, the fact that a grown ass man let's his mother cook, clean and do his laundry is concerning.  INFO: Is he actually saving money or is he living the high life because he gets free room and board?  Does he know how to cook, clean, do laundry etc.?  If you were to move in with him would he expect you to do all of the cooking and housework?", "Never lived in his own :(", "Mom, Dad, can my girlfriend spend the night?  Pleeeease!", "This is not about rather he can afford to live on his own or not. She is old enough to know better than to treat someone house like a flop house. \n\nI would NEVER go to a boyfriend\u2019s parents house: I didn\u2019t do that even when in 20s.", "Would be really weird to be in my 30's and not only living at home, but having my gf come spend the night a few days a week.....", "If he\u2019s been living home saving for 8-10+ he should have at least a decent down payment for a house by now or at least an apartment, unless he\u2019s supporting them.", "\"He asked his parents if I could sleep over Saturday night.\" \n\n\nNo offense, but after I read that, I had to double check your ages. Read that sentence again.", "I would send flowers with a note: \"I am so sorry for overstaying my welcome and making you uncomfortable.\"  \nAnother suggestion: Invite them for dinner at your apartment. Treat them to being pure guests. Even if you order in or make something simple, they'll appreciate the gesture.", "The way they're handling their frustration is nonsense. They don't have the spine to talk to their own son or to OP, so they try to make visiting their home inhospitable. That's miserable behavior, and it certainly doesn't solve the underlying issue that is causing their unhappiness.", "That\u2019s a bit extreme. Dude could just like lounging in his boxers after a long day but doesn\u2019t feel comfortable doing so in front of his son\u2019s girlfriend. That\u2019s normal. OP and son don\u2019t own the house and until they do, they\u2019re the ones who need to accommodate the homeowners, not the reverse.", "OP is being invited by the BF. Its on the parents to talk to him, which it seems they finally did too late. \n\nAlso they said she doesn't help or offer to help and then he proceeds to list all the things she does to help. So yes, I'd agree with ingrates.", "She stated she does take food from the store over there and does help cook and clean", "If he's just going back home after, it's only one way", "Is it a work around? Who's happy with this situation? OP isn't, the parents aren't, so it doesn't work. How was I wrong? Patronizing is a matter of opinion I guess ...", "It's not a work around. It's inconvenient for everyone that is not him. She isn't sleeping in her bed, his parents are sharing their home... \n\nIs her and their comfortablity not worth the drive?", "And that's where you realize how much he wants to spend time with you, how much are you worth for 15 minutes of traffic? 30 minutes, 40 minutes? 1 hour ?\r  \nHow much can you sacrifice for the person you love.\r  \n\r  \nAnd how much time does she use to go to her partner's parents' house?", "But he\u2019s not doing anything to fix this situation, he\u2019s expecting YOU to do it all. He won\u2019t drive to you so you have to go to his parents house. They don\u2019t want you there that much, but instead of finding some compromise (I\u2019m sorry mom, on days she\u2019s here I\u2019ll cook so you don\u2019t have to cook for her) he\u2019s trying to get YOU to fix it by doing more. I do think his parents are likely taking their frustrations at their 30 year old son still living at home (and from the sounds of it still acting like a teenager) out on you, but it\u2019s his living situation he needs to find the solution.", "It would be different if it was his own house, but it's not. It's his parent's house. Also, I think its odd that you've been (apparently) spending time with him multiple times a week for over a year and you're still not sure of your relationship with him.", "I get it but the alternative is continually going to his parents place when they don\u2019t want you there and continue to disrespect you by thinking the worst of you.\n\nI think if you explain that to your boyfriend and don\u2019t want to give off the impression that you\u2019re \u201cfreeloading\u201d off them then hopefully he agrees to spending more time at your place instead. \n\nAlso just a side note but his parents really are the worst, I hope you don\u2019t take their words to heart.

Taken them out to dinner? You\u2019re all adults, the playing field should be even.

Help pay for food, cook, set the table and clean?\r  \n\r  \nor expect \"women to take care of everything\"\r  \n\r  \nThe guy is a burden for parents who at his age should have the freedom to walk around their house like God sent them into the world without worrying about their son and girlfriend.", "At least in that aspect I cut you some slack.\nThat\u2019s really mature of you to have these thoughts and boundaries.\nKeep that up!", "I think this is very smart. You totally run the risk of turning into Mommy #2 if he moves straight from his parent\u2019s place to yours. Especially since his solution to his mother feeling overwhelmed by your presence is for *you* to do more work, rather than for him to do basic adult things in his own home that would take some of the burden off his mother (like cooking dinner). \n\nBut you do have to stop going over there. Not because you\u2019ve done anything wrong (you haven\u2019t from what I read here), but because they are very clearly desperate to have an empty nest and will be resentful of anyone who is coming over to spend the night with their son regularly. And if your boyfriend can\u2019t see where the problem lies, I think I\u2019d start to reconsider the relationship entirely.", "Wait.  Your early 30s bf has NEVER lived outside of his parents\u2019 house?  \n\nNot once?

Weaponized incompetence and all that. When I got really sick, like, needing to spend a few days in the hospital sick, when I came back the condo was a MESS and he just kind of shrugged and said he and our housemate didn't know how to do it the way I did so they figured I could do it when I got back. Out of the hospital. Still weak and needing to be on medication. And they'd been living pretty much excluisively on take-out and his cat's litterbox hadn't been cleaned the entire time (HIS cat, mind you, not ours, I was strictly not allowed to get a pet of my own because he'd gotten the condo from his mother and she said only one pet knowing he already had a cat.

Showing up for dinner multiple times per week is not cool. How many times have you cooked for them, brought a side dish, offered to do the whole meal or bought groceries?", "If he were a decent roommate, he might not be so bad for his parents. Like, if his mom cooked dinner 1/3 of the time, his dad 1/3, and him 1/3 that would be a better situation. If they all split going to the grocery store, do their own laundry, clean up after themselves, etc. than his mom would probably be a lot more patient.

And she is spending the night and hanging out there. Its their house with a guest that is basically living there.", "I've read all the comments and IMO you are getting some great input and sound like you are doing a lot of your own work reflecting on your relationship and living situation. I can relate to one specific part of what you said, though it happened to me in my early 20s. I was in college living in an apartment when I started dating a guy who lived in the dorm, but whose parents lived in town. My dad and his wife lived overseas, so I had been living with my roommate in our first apartment, and then moved to my own small apartment just before I started dating this guy who lived in the dorm. \n\nSo we started dating, and he told me his mom and sister wanted to go out to lunch with me, to meet me. I'd never heard of anyone doing this before and I was nervous but it was fine; it felt kind of like an interview with friendly people, but I got through it and they were both nice and kind, and they were great to the staff in the restaurant, so I liked them just for that to begin with.\n\nMy boyfriend and I were getting along great and he spent some time at my apartment but still lived in the dorm. We both had to study a lot, so we didn't do that much outside of school, but he went home almost every weekend, as it was only 20 minutes from campus. My mom lived the same distance away in the opposite direction, and I went to see her multiple times a week but rarely stayed the night. \n\nBy the time we had been dating about a year, my mom had moved to be near my grandparents hours away, so I didn't have any family in town, and my bf and I were spending every weekend together, and he spent a lot of nights at my apartment. I went with him to his parents' house almost every time when he went there on the weekend, basically just because we spent all our spare time together. I didn't think anything of it, as they had always been really welcoming to me, and it didn't seem lopsided to me because he spent so much time at my place.\n\nOne afternoon, he came over and was very upset with his mother and her mother, who was visiting. He told me his grandmother had told his mother that it wasn't proper that I was over at their house so much, that he should be \"courting\" me at my family's house (never mind they didn't live anywhere near) and that it was only proper for me to come to their home if he and I were engaged. So he was really upset that he couldn't hang out at his house with me any more because he was not ready to get engaged.\n\nThat was fine with me. I was so surprised that they were so conservative and stuck in the past, because they had seemed like fun people to be around. It was a little awkward because they were pretty old fashioned and conservative, and I was a feminist but I just never argued or brought up anything controversial. This was way back when Title IX had just been passed (girls got the same resources as boys in school, including in sports), Gloria Steinem had just started Ms. magazine and young women my age were getting the idea that we didn't just have to go to school to get an MRS degree, that we could have careers and not be dependent on a man. \n\nSo I was fine with it, but what really shocked me was feeling like all the time I had been in their home, when I didn't have family in the area or a family home to go to, I had felt like I was being treated like family or at least like a family friend, when all along, I was not seen that way. That was a really tough realization and it really hurt to realize I felt much closer to them than they did to me.\n\nThis is such a long story, but it really resonated with me, the part of your story about you being in their home, feeling at home and trying to be helpful, and then being shocked and hurt to find out that they saw you as a stranger who didn't belong and wasn't welcome. I'm so sorry you had to go through that, and people have already said plenty about your bf and his part in that dynamic, so I won't go there.\n\nOne thing that really helped me that I thought might help you is that in spending so much more time in my own place instead of trying to get away all the time to be with people, I started to really make it a special place just for me. I refinished a dresser and got a kick out of it every time I took out my clothes for the day. I put special mementos around the place, I put my drawings on the walls, I played the music I loved and just enjoyed being home and tidying up the place, sitting for hours reading and not having to be anywhere except where I wanted to be. I started to spend a lot more time in the school library, and at the local museum. And I started walking a couple of miles a day. \n\nI think if you could make your space special just for you, even if it's small, you might be more fulfilled spending time at home by yourself. And if you go out where there are other people, you might meet people who give you a different view of yourself. Even if you don't make a lot of new friends, someone might say something complimentary or insightful that helps you see yourself in a new way, maybe even a surprisingly special way.\n\nI'm so sorry things didn't go well with the bf's family, and I hope you don't internalize all the blame for that. You stepped into a dynamic that had very little to do with you and everything to do with the parents and their son. But now that you know where you stand, you can create something more positive for yourself. I wish you the best, because you deserve the best.\n\nSorry for the long long story -- it's been cathartic for me after all these years, but I could probably have left a lot out. I just want you to know, you deserve the best.\n\nbtw, that boyfriend did end up being my 1st husband for a few years, and after we split up, someone I'd known for years from school asked me out and I was so dense, I thought he just wanted me to give him a ride to the movies (he was visiting from out of town). It took me a while to get a clue, but we started long distance dating, and then we got married, and we are coming up on our 38th anniversary. The 1st husband always wanted to be friends, but I could not deal with the pain of knowing he had never wanted to get married and only did so because of pressure from his family. It has taken me decades to be okay with that, and I recently got in touch because I wanted him to have some things that I know my kids won't care about but that would mean a lot to him because they are things that artist friends of both of ours made when we were together. \n\nI'm just telling you that because I'm guessing the feelings you have about your bf and his family are as intense as the feelings I have held onto for decades. When you feel something for people who don't return that to you, it can really really hurt and that can be really difficult. That's okay. You can still move forward even if you haven't been able to totally let go of the dreams you had for your future. You can still have a dreamy future, just probably not with that person, and you will become a different person yourself in creating the future you deserve.\n\nI am wishing you the best and hope you will update us. You deserve everything good, and you are not responsible for someone else's maturity or decisions. <3", "What struck me is mom seems upset you don\u2019t come earlier to help prep food/make meals.

But once we hit the six month mark of dating, I didn't see him do anything for his license. I never saw him studying or doing any paperwork or submitting any hours to his boss. It wasn't till August of this year that I really put the fire under his ass and I said hey you need to do this or I'm gonna leave you. And finally he just submitted all the paperwork.", "Yeah you're absolutely right! And I've brought up my concerns a lot, especially because I'm a woman in my early 30s and I want a lot out of life. And when I bring up my concerns in my worries, he just kind of looks at me blankly, and says I know. But we don't really have a discussion. He doesn't really participate and it just is more of me, nagging him and getting frustrated and then starting to yell.he just realizes that he is unmotivated and he's been having a lot of struggles with focusing and concentrating and getting his life together. He does take some responsibility for it, but it's more that he just realizes that he needs to see a doctor and maybe get on medication or something", "With some families it is, unfortunately, a transition. Lived with my father and grandfather in my late teens (18,19) early 20s and contributed to help them. They gave me what they could from what I paid them for a down payment. I paid that and went to school and worked.\n\nCut a few years later, grandads dead, and dad is retired. Social Security doesn\u2019t go as far as it should and his retirement home is shutting down. So once I finish grad school now he will be moving in with me.\n\nPoint being as he\u2019s 70ish I will probably end up living with my dad into my 40s or 50s.

I just balk at a 30yo being made dinner every night by their mother, unless they're physically or mentally disabled of course. Why hasn't he gotten to a stage where he's doing cooking a few nights a week? He's been an adult for over a decade, isn't it weird to have his mother cook for him every night?

Like I said to another commenter, forget chores she should be paying rent.", "No I bet the problem here is the bf. He is inviting a guest over but isn't willing to take on the cooking and most likely prefers to have her come to his house, so he gets to eat without actually picking up food or cooking at her house together.  Just speaks to me that the bf doesn't want to put any real effort into the relationship.  He doesn't want to give up his comforts and have to do more work.  \n\nOP may have some serious work to do getting bf to do his share, if they ever move in together.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s odd that he\u2019s \u201crespecting their rules\u201d as much as that conversation is one for him and his parents to have privately to come to a standing understanding of what the boundaries are. One night a week? Two a month? Two a month plus do X-chores and buy groceries and you move out in 6 months?\n\nIt makes it seem like there isn\u2019t a healthy give-and-take to the living arrangement. It also means OP can\u2019t even know how to plan a weekend because he\u2019s asking/relying on so much of his parents that they can veto date night short notice. \n\nIf these arrangements need to be micromanaged on a night-by-night basis, I\u2019d take that as a strong indicator that the situation is too much of an imposition on them.", "My inlaws had to stay with us for a month during renovations on their home. I love them, but they were there so much and your regular routine is not the same. You can't just jump up in the morning half dressed and get a coffee, and you feel the need to engage in conversation. It feels like you're always \"on\".

I never knew they presumed that though so years went by where I never revealed how bad things were and they never asked, it was only the last maybe 18 months where his spending on himself became more extravagant but I was barely scraping by did it become obvious and as people asked questions I revealed we were 50/50 on everything, he wanted more and more expensive birthday and Christmas gifts (\u00a3400+ gifts) and was spending maybe \u00a350 on me, he wanted more and more extravagant holidays (Mauritius, Japan, Hawaii) which I couldn\u2019t afford to go on (he wasn\u2019t willing to pay for me and I couldn\u2019t save that kind of money whilst earning so little and paying half of everything) he was buying designer clothes, expensive watches, a new fast car\u2026while I was walking around in old clothes and darning up holes in them. He actually paid less than half as he never paid for groceries or cleaning products. He also didn\u2019t do any housework/ cooking/ DIY/ garden work at all for 2.5 years. Once it came out what was really going on everyone was really shocked. \n\nAnd in case you\u2019re wondering \u201cwell, why didn\u2019t you get a better job?\u201d. Oh I tried. He would actively stop me trying to apply for better jobs, always said \u201cbut we agreed to concentrate on MY career first, once I get the next promotion then we\u2019ll concentrate on you\u201d, which never happened despite having 3 promotions. Any time I was applying or interviewing he\u2019d interrupt with \u201ccan you look at this presentation\u201d or \u201cmy shirt needs ironing\u201d. So then I offered to be a stay at home partner but I won\u2019t contribute financially anymore. Oh no. Then he called me a goldigger who wanted to leech off of him. So I just couldn\u2019t win no matter what. Also he worked 10 mins from our home and I worked an hour away, more with traffic. So if you include my commute I was out of the home 10hours a week more than him. Plus doing all the housework and cooking takes time and energy, so I wasn\u2019t really giving my all to job searching because I was so warn out.\n\nSince leaving I\u2019ve more than doubled my salary and retrained in a tech role, bought my own house and dog and am (other than my mortgage) debt free.

If he had his own unit, it wouldn't be an issue, would it?

There are tons of comfy separates out there if he\u2019s not into sets.", "I\u2019d seriously question your boyfriend\u2019s commitment to your relationship, though.", "I mean, you should still take a lot of responsibility for it. I don\u2019t think they have a problem with their son being there like a lot of people are saying. They\u2019re comfortable with him. But you are a guest, not part of the family dynamic.\n\nI don\u2019t think you were being bad, just thoughtless.\n\nBut this \u201cI feel like they are the ones who need to change and apologize\u201d, the fucking audacity of you.\n\nYTA", "Lol \u201cimmediately\u201d\u2026after 30+ years", "He needs to get his professional license and he needs to move out of his parents house. I have voiced both of these things for at least six months with him, and he keeps telling me that they will not happen overnight. Which is fine, but he needs to work on these things.", "Yeah there's definitely a freeloader here and it's not OP.", "Yes but I would bet that they might be just FINE with having sonny-boy living with them.  This way they can pretend that they haven't grown older and no one's grown up.  My parents were exactly like that.  The difficulty comes with the insertion of a significant other...their boy is having sex!!  Horrid thought!!  In any case, the OP needs to back off, stay in her own apartment, and reassess whether she really wants to stay in a relationship with a guy who has to ask his parents if she can come over.  Good grief.  ESH in my opinion.", "Yeah, I think they're deflecting and it's really HIM they are sick of.", "On the other hand, having an adult child move back in who pays rent can save the budget of a retired adult", "^^^THIS^^^", "Those are goals, not behaviors. :/", "Girl please get away from this loser. You sound awesome & he is dragging you down. Cut him off & don\u2019t look back!", "I did this. I married this. It was horrible. \n\nGirl\u2026 run.", "I have to know- is nagging coming from you, or is that the word he uses to describe it? Because if he actually used the term nagging then you should leave. It\u2019s a major sign that he doesn\u2019t respect you.  \n\nAlso, $22 an hour is really not bad. There are so many things from your comments that really bother me about your relationship and I really hope you take the advice so many have given to run away now and don\u2019t give him that summer deadline to grow tf up. I\u2019m afraid like a lot of frustrated women, you will just continue to extend that time limit and make more excuses for him. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s a good guy and you love him for a reason, but living with a man who has only ever lived with his parents and has no motivation unless someone gives him direction is not a future you want, believe all of us here telling you that. This man is a child. He won\u2019t provide for you. if you had children, the burden to support them would fall to you, the majority of the household duties will also fall to you I guarantee it. You might have fallen on hard times, but you seem to have a lot going for you! You have your masters! Good dick grows on trees, girl! There are a lot of adult men with their own places to live who will communicate with you better than shutting down and getting defensive when you talk about your feelings and try to help them grow and be an actual partner.", "Yup, I suspect it's really their son they are sick of. \n\nHis asking to have a GF stay overnight is just a bridge too far.", "How often do either of them buy groceries you think?", "\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "It's definitely crossed my mind. I think after I lost my job, it really stuck out to me how he doesn't have an independent life, and if we were married, he wouldn't be able to take care of me. It's not that I need somebody to take care of me, it's just that when I lost my job, I lost my source of income and it really made me scared that I have a partner that wouldn't be able tosupport us if something went wrong again in the future. And that really scares me and it makes me worry. But he's in a really good blue-collar field where he could make a lot of money, he just is taking forever to pass his exam. Honestly, I don't know what I'm gonna do about our relationship,", "You're not wrong! I just hoping that he'll get his shift together but I just keep waiting and waiting and waiting. I told him that he needs to live on his own for a full year before we even think about moving it together. And he told me that, \"you have unrealistic expectations. \"", "Yeah, but in this economy and the area of the US that we live in, $22 is basically minimum wage. The thing is, he's really smart! And he has blue-collar skills that are very high demand and not in a lot of people know how to do it. So it's incredibly frustrating that he's just sitting on all these skills that he could be making money off of building an incredible career off of.  \n\nA few years ago he got in a really bad car accident, and he had a bunch of medical bills, and he had to have a bunch of surgeries, and he got injured really bad. He's OK now, but he has a little back pain. But he told me that ever since that car accident happened, he just lost a lot of his motivation and a lot of his self-esteem and he just hasn't felt like himself ever since. Which I totally Empathize with, and I commiserate with. But he needs to get his shit together and be an adult. He lives at home, and his mom makes three meals a day for him, he doesn't pick up any laundry off the floor, and he just gets taken care of constantly by his mom. And I don't want to be with somebody like that. No matter how emotionally, intelligent he is. He needs to be an adult."]}
