Because if you actually think he's the sort of person who might do that, then DON'T MOVE IN WITH HIM. \n\nAnd if you have trust that he is not the sort of person to do that, and that he loves you for you, well.... then that's completely moot.

Yes. Do I think you should pay 35% more in rent for a place HE needs to upgrade to? Absolutely not.\n\nHe doesn't get to decide how you should spend your income or what you can afford. And he definitely shouldn't be hanging any financial decisions in an 8 m.o. relationship on what he'll be making in 5 years.\n\nNormally I would think you were \\~maybe\\~ being a bit paranoid about being taken advantage of but the way he's saying you must not be serious about the relationship if you don't pay more is a huge red flag or me and you should trust your gut.", "I don't think Y T A but I would seriously reconsider this relationship if you are so mistrustful and concerned about financial manipulation.

Whilst it's true he may not be there for you in 5 years he might also be.  \n\nI think \"trust me\" isn't good enough in this day and age though.

Maybe this is a sign you're not ready to move in together, though.  8 months is really not that long.\n\nEdit: I just realized I lived this exact scenario.  I was dating a med student and I paid much more of the rent and we broke up before she became a doctor...  but it never really occurred to me to regret it.  It seemed fair to me then and still does that we pay according to our ability in a relationship.  It's not about being paid back in the future it's about being in it together.", "NTA\n\nHe still makes 60k a year, that with no kids after rent and bills is still a lot of money for disposable income.\n\nI would understand why he would want you to pay more if you were together for years but 8 months is still the honeymoon period.\n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee he\u2019s going to make that much money in 5 years and you might not even be together then. Your boyfriend does sound quite entitled", "NTA. If you marry, it doesn't matter whether the savings are in your account or in his account, because when you combine funds it's all the same. If you split up, paying 50-50 now means you don't get screwed.\n\nIf you could afford half each, would you choose to live in the more expensive house? Do you think an extra $600 a month is worth it for the extra you get?\n\nRent is basically throwing money away - personally, I'd rather rent the minimum I need and save for a deposit on a purchase. But YMMV.", "NTA. The only time splitting the rent differently would be a logical solution would be if the higher-paid person wanted something outside of the budget of the lower-paid person.

After all your use of the property, utilities,  etc. has nothing to do with how much or little the occupiers earn.  I don't think bf is AH for asking but if it were me I'd say no.

Take that from someone who banked rolled a dude who earned more than I did", "ESH I don't think it's unreasonable of him to ask you to contribute more to your life together - rather than just having a grossly unequal living standard between the two of you, but it's not wise to compromise on base things like rent. What happens if your company goes through layoffs? If your living standards are on the higher salary then you'll be fucked. The compromise here is to reduce your expectations and rent somewhere cheaper that he'll be better able to afford. Just as you want to do. But *you* need to be prepared to pay more or more often for the exceptionals - dinners out, holidays, gifts, etc. Your \"my money is my money\" attitude is selfish and untrusting.\n\nAnd 8 months is pretty early? If you were married, or years into the relationship with kids? *Then* the \"you help me now, I'll help you later\" approach is valid. Too soon to tie him to your salary for basic living costs.

But for now NTA.", "Info: when he makes 300k a year will you be keeping the same 50/50 agreement or will you be changing your tune?", "Unless he's put a ring on it, don't commit to anything, especially a house together.  He needs to live within his means until his career kicks off.. - NTA", "NTA. This seems to be to be really early in the relationship for this to me, especially with him suggestion another place that you'd have to pay more for. At this stage in your relationship, keeping things 50/50 and only doing things you can both afford seems like the most reasonable thing to do.", "NTA. You were willing to split evenly for the less expensive apartment.  Why should you bear most of the burden of increased payment for the more expensive place that he prefers?  Good for you for standing up for yourself and being on the lookout for issues of long-term compatibility.", "If you are genuinely concerned that he's latching onto you for money and will ditch you once he makes a doctor's salary, then you have bigger problems than how you're splitting rent. \n\nNTA for not wanting to pay more than 50% of the rent. He should choose a place he can afford 50% of on his current salary. He's not entitled to a portion of your larger salary, and if you're uncomfortable with it, that's the end of the discussion. But you should examine these concerns. Listen to that gut feeling that thinks he might take advantage of you. Explore what actions of his are making you feel that way. (Like, for example, his accusation that you're not serious about the relationship because you won't pay more than your fair share of the rent. That's a weird guilt trip to lay on someone.)", "\"If you arent willimg to help me now...\" \n\nDoes he need help? Does he have money problems?  Seems big red flag", "Nta\n\n\n\nYou want to get a place you both can afford. That is fair. He wants to go higher so he can live beyond his means.\n\n\n\nBut you can foot the bill. Absolutely not. It would be one thing if you wanted that expensive apartment.  But you don't. \n\n\nPlease don't rent until you agree. Otherwise your going to have real problems once that lease is signed.", "NTA - you are both coming from different backgrounds and mindsets. My concern is that he is pushing you even after you said no multiple times. I would suggest you keep looking and take your time finding a place that is maybe around $2200. In the meantime think about if his refusing to listen to you and respect your values is something you want to stay with long term.", "NTA, but i feel like if you prefer the comfort of the more expensive apt and you can afford it, why not? I understand the principle thing, and in everything else you could keep it that way but if it's something you would spend on anyway, why not?", "NTA 8 month is not a long relationship at all and you stated that early on he was even pushing for you to pay more which is highly inappropriate. He might have good intentions but his promises and idea for the future are based off such a short period of time, I would not be ok with the situation he is proposing", "NTA but this may not be a compatible relationship. You are feeling uneasy and not okay with his proposition. He is pushing it and trying to guilt you. I think you have your doubts for a reason.", "NTA - you are showing prudence and good principles.  He shouldn't expect you, as a girlfriend, to treat him financially as if you were a wife.  You guys aren't married, and you have separate finances.  And 8 months is not so long a time that you can treat the lines of your relationship as being blurred or start banking on financial commitments now for a payoff that may or may not happen in five years.  If he's in his residency, he's smart enough to get that.  \n\n\nThat makes his refusal a red flag.  Good luck!", "I'm surprised with the amount of N T A votes.\n\nI'm sorry, I think YTA. To me it's perfectly sensible to have these discussions before moving in together, It dosnt make him seem like he's taking advantage of you. Splitting outgoings proportionally is a very fair way to manage your finances. What will happen when you have kids and want to work less, yet he's qualified and earning twice as much? Or if you get sick and can't work? Or if you decide you want to change careers. Will you still want to split everything 50/50 when he out earns you? \n\nIt's clear you don't trust him and are not ready to move in together yet if you are convinced he is just out there to take advantage of you. Relationships go through peaks and troughs and there may be times he earns more and times you earn more and you have to be able to work through that in a fair way. \n\nMaybe see how your relationship pans over over the next 12 months before considering moving in together as it does seem like you are ready for that commitment with him", "Info: \n\nHave you told him that your family and friends have all told you him and all other residents are untrustworthy golddiggers? \n\nFollow up question, if you think he's a golddigger why are you dating him?\n\nLast question, if you're still together in five years and his salary suddenly jumps to triple yours will you still stand by the 50/50 split, or will it go out the window the second he becomes the primary earner? Would you be fine with a pre-nup that completely separates your finances and earnings if he's making triple your salary?", "Info: why are you with him if you don\u2019t trust him? It sounds like your entire mindset regarding the relationship is that he\u2019s going to leave you once he gets a better pay.", "ESH\n\nMostly him. I hate how income based division of expenses has become an expectation rather than an option.  If you wanted the more expensive place that was beyond his budget then sure it would be reasonable.\n\nWhile he might be checking a bunch of the boxes that your friends and mom are warning you about, that shouldn't be the reason for wanting keep it 50/50.  \n\n>says if I\u2019m not willing to help him now I\u2019m not serious about the relationship.\n\nIt's a relationship issue at this point.

The fact that he is so pushy about it is a bit of a red flag. You're right, you don't know that you'll be together in 5 years, and you're not married. \n\nYou might push him out of the relationship early by sticking to your boundaries, but you could also grow to resent him if you don't. \n\nHonestly, I'd hold back on moving in together. It's only been 8 months! Dont move in just because you can save money. Its recipe for disaster.", "YTA - A relationship is about sacrifice and compromise. If your reason for keeping the split 50/50 is you're worried he's only using you for your money and going to leave once he starts making money I think that's the real issue. Why do you feel that way? If you genuinely think it will happen why stay with him? How would you feel if he was making 300k and still kept all finances strictly 50/50?", "NTA just keep it same until you both legally commit then discuss finances (ex: one pot of cash for one couple) then buy a house together in both your names. Good luck.", "NTA, I dated a woman who made more than I did but we still did everything 50/50. We would even alternate who pays for date nights and things like that. It's not a compromise if you aren't receiving a benefit in return. He gets a nicer place and pays less, what do you get out of the deal?", "NTA because it's a short relationship, I might just simply not move in w this person. If you ARE committed to living together I def feel like splitting rent 60-40 is fair", "YTA I do think rent should be split based on income. Having said that I wouldn\u2019t move in with him. Especially the more expensive place he wants. You\u2019ve not been together for a year yet and this 5 year I\u2019ll pay you back is crap. If you really think this relationship is love, I want to have kids and grow old together move in together. Make sure not to mingle money, Separate accounts. I would choose the place I could best afford on my own. Just in case it doesn\u2019t work out and his 5 year plan never materializes.", "YTA.  it\u2019s compromise and support.   And stop listening to your mom and friends.  You\u2019re an adult act like one. \nWhen my partner and I first lived together he made significantly more then me at the time.  We determined the percentage difference in income and that became what we each paid.  Say 60/40.   And as things changed the percentages changed.", "I'm not going to vote, but I have a question:\n\nI have paid more than 70% of all living expenses in all of my relationships. I was told every time I complained that since I made more, I should cover more.\n\nWas that inappropriate for others to require that of me?", "I'm going to go with YTA. Not because I necessarily think income-based payment makes sense in an 8-month relationship. But because I think if you have THIS much distrust of medical residents, you shouldn't date them. It's not fair to the guy you say is generous and kind and giving you no reason to distrust him to constantly treat him as though he's waiting to dump you.", "You make 120k a year and still live with your parents?

If you wanted the more expensive place and he was going to struggle, that would be different, but HE wants it and can\u2019t afford it. That makes me wonder honestly, especially if he\u2019s arguing so much and the relationship is so young. He\u2019s TA for expecting a more expensive place than he can afford, especially so early in a relationship and when you are fine with living within his means.

If he doesn't burn out/flunk out, and if he's talented & lucky to get into a high paying specialty. He most likely will also have a lot of debt to repay. I'd be concerned that he's planning his lifestyle now based off of a wild prediction about what he might earn in future. People that do that usually aren't good with money, and you'll end up paying for it if you go along with it. (This, followed by inevitable resentment, is far more likely than someone using their partner for their income.)", "NTA. 8 months in you should not be expected to pay for any of your partners portion of the rent split, especially if they are the one that wants a fancier place.

At this point in the relationship it\u2019s totally reasonable to go 50/50 on dates, outings, etc. These are experiences that you\u2019re both sharing equally, there\u2019s no reason for you to pay more, unless you\u2019re insisting on going to high priced places that he normally could not afford. \n\nThat said, are you really sure you want to go forward and move in with this guy after only 8 months, especially with your misgivings about his intentions? If you really want to move out, then do so and live alone for now. There\u2019s no rush to cohabitate. If things go sour, breaking a lease can be a pain/expensive and you know he cannot afford that.

But if you are this mistrustful of your bf that you're refusing to EVER pay more, you have no business being in a relationship. When it comes to dates, it's pretty standard that the person who makes more might treat more often. I'm not saying you should pay for everything all the time, but it sounds like it would be pretty miserable to be dating you when you're walking around with an attitude of \"he's just using me and he's going to break up with me when he finishes his residency.\" \n\nAlso, if you do stay together, be prepared for keeping things completely 50/50, and you better not expect him to start paying more when he makes double what you make.", "Hmm. 50/50 can be fine, but I'm not sure your reasoning is very reasonable.\n\n> The reason I won\u2019t pay more than him is that I\u2019m from a family of nurses and most of my friends are nurses.\n\nWhile it DOES happen, if you believe your partner is going to do this, why are you with him? If he thought you were latching onto him just for his potential income in future *and was using that idea to justify financial decisions*, what would you tell him?\n\n> I\u2019m not serious about the relationship\n\nI think his conclusion about this is correct, even if perhaps his logic is not. You don't trust him and don't appear to see a future with him. Which is fine, sometimes relationships are temporary, but you're on very different pages about this. I suggest doing some serious thinking about whether you want to be in a relationship with him, sign leases with him, etc. Your actions as a couple don't appear to be reflecting how you actually feel.\n\nI'm not quite sure what to give on a judgement for this one, I guess NAH because I don't think either stance is technically unreasonable. Btw, him signing a lease that would be so far beyond what he could handle by himself is very risky and I think that scenario should be avoided whenever possible regardless.", "NTA 50/50 makes sense.

My partner and I kept things 50/50 for the 6 years we dated even though I was in grad school for 2/3rds of that and he was established in his field. Obviously that's my personal opinion and different things work for different couples but what if they break up? Should OP still subsidize his rent if they aren't together? Is he going to be able to afford the rent increase for the place HE wanted to live.\n\nIf OP was the one who wanted the more expensive place and still wanted to keep it 50/50 that would be an issue. \n\nMy partner was totally fine splitting a place that fit my lower budget and he was able to save a ton. And when we did get married, most of that went into a house with both of our names on it. Her salary will still benefit him in the long run if they do stay together.\n\nHis desire to live outside his means would be more of a red flag to me.
