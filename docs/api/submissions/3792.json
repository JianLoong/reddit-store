Because if you actually think he's the sort of person who might do that, then DON'T MOVE IN WITH HIM. \n\nAnd if you have trust that he is not the sort of person to do that, and that he loves you for you, well.... then that's completely moot. It's fine if you feel strongly about splitting things 50/50, but \"he might take advantage of me\" can't be the reason, if you don't actually think he would take advantage of you.", "NTA\n\nDo I think you could stand to let the strict \"50/50\" thing slide on stuff like movie tickets? Yes. Do I think you should pay 35% more in rent for a place HE needs to upgrade to? Absolutely not.\n\nHe doesn't get to decide how you should spend your income or what you can afford. And he definitely shouldn't be hanging any financial decisions in an 8 m.o. relationship on what he'll be making in 5 years.\n\nNormally I would think you were \\~maybe\\~ being a bit paranoid about being taken advantage of but the way he's saying you must not be serious about the relationship if you don't pay more is a huge red flag or me and you should trust your gut.", "I don't think Y T A but I would seriously reconsider this relationship if you are so mistrustful and concerned about financial manipulation.

Whilst it's true he may not be there for you in 5 years he might also be.  \n\nI think \"trust me\" isn't good enough in this day and age though.

Maybe this is a sign you're not ready to move in together, though.  8 months is really not that long.\n\nEdit: I just realized I lived this exact scenario.  I was dating a med student and I paid much more of the rent and we broke up before she became a doctor...  but it never really occurred to me to regret it.  It seemed fair to me then and still does that we pay according to our ability in a relationship.  It's not about being paid back in the future it's about being in it together.", "NTA\n\nHe still makes 60k a year, that with no kids after rent and bills is still a lot of money for disposable income.\n\nI would understand why he would want you to pay more if you were together for years but 8 months is still the honeymoon period.\n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee he\u2019s going to make that much money in 5 years and you might not even be together then. Your boyfriend does sound quite entitled", "NTA. If you marry, it doesn't matter whether the savings are in your account or in his account, because when you combine funds it's all the same. If you split up, paying 50-50 now means you don't get screwed.\n\nIf you could afford half each, would you choose to live in the more expensive house? Do you think an extra $600 a month is worth it for the extra you get?\n\nRent is basically throwing money away - personally, I'd rather rent the minimum I need and save for a deposit on a purchase. But YMMV.", "NTA. The only time splitting the rent differently would be a logical solution would be if the higher-paid person wanted something outside of the budget of the lower-paid person.

After all your use of the property, utilities,  etc. has nothing to do with how much or little the occupiers earn.  I don't think bf is AH for asking but if it were me I'd say no.  If he is \"all in\" on the relationship how about he proposes and signs a prenuptial saying he'll share a big chunk of his future income with you if you do eventually split?", "Your NTA but you'd be a fool to move in with a man who is already fishing money from you. Take that from someone who banked rolled a dude who earned more than I did", "ESH I don't think it's unreasonable of him to ask you to contribute more to your life together - rather than just having a grossly unequal living standard between the two of you, but it's not wise to compromise on base things like rent. What happens if your company goes through layoffs? If your living standards are on the higher salary then you'll be fucked. The compromise here is to reduce your expectations and rent somewhere cheaper that he'll be better able to afford. Just as you want to do. But *you* need to be prepared to pay more or more often for the exceptionals - dinners out, holidays, gifts, etc. Your \"my money is my money\" attitude is selfish and untrusting.\n\nAnd 8 months is pretty early? If you were married, or years into the relationship with kids? *Then* the \"you help me now, I'll help you later\" approach is valid. Too soon to tie him to your salary for basic living costs.

But for now NTA.", "Info: when he makes 300k a year will you be keeping the same 50/50 agreement or will you be changing your tune?", "Unless he's put a ring on it, don't commit to anything, especially a house together.  He needs to live within his means until his career kicks off.. - NTA", "NTA. This seems to be to be really early in the relationship for this to me, especially with him suggestion another place that you'd have to pay more for. At this stage in your relationship, keeping things 50/50 and only doing things you can both afford seems like the most reasonable thing to do.", "NTA. You were willing to split evenly for the less expensive apartment.  Why should you bear most of the burden of increased payment for the more expensive place that he prefers?  Good for you for standing up for yourself and being on the lookout for issues of long-term compatibility.", "If you are genuinely concerned that he's latching onto you for money and will ditch you once he makes a doctor's salary, then you have bigger problems than how you're splitting rent. \n\nNTA for not wanting to pay more than 50% of the rent. He should choose a place he can afford 50% of on his current salary. He's not entitled to a portion of your larger salary, and if you're uncomfortable with it, that's the end of the discussion. But you should examine these concerns. Listen to that gut feeling that thinks he might take advantage of you. Explore what actions of his are making you feel that way. (Like, for example, his accusation that you're not serious about the relationship because you won't pay more than your fair share of the rent. That's a weird guilt trip to lay on someone.)", "\"If you arent willimg to help me now...\" \n\nDoes he need help? Does he have money problems?  Seems big red flag", "Nta\n\n\n\nYou want to get a place you both can afford. That is fair. He wants to go higher so he can live beyond his means.\n\n\n\nBut you can foot the bill. Absolutely not. It would be one thing if you wanted that expensive apartment.  But you don't. \n\n\nPlease don't rent until you agree. Otherwise your going to have real problems once that lease is signed.", "NTA - you are both coming from different backgrounds and mindsets. My concern is that he is pushing you even after you said no multiple times. I would suggest you keep looking and take your time finding a place that is maybe around $2200. In the meantime think about if his refusing to listen to you and respect your values is something you want to stay with long term.", "NTA, but i feel like if you prefer the comfort of the more expensive apt and you can afford it, why not? I understand the principle thing, and in everything else you could keep it that way but if it's something you would spend on anyway, why not?", "NTA 8 month is not a long relationship at all and you stated that early on he was even pushing for you to pay more which is highly inappropriate. He might have good intentions but his promises and idea for the future are based off such a short period of time, I would not be ok with the situation he is proposing", "NTA but this may not be a compatible relationship. You are feeling uneasy and not okay with his proposition. He is pushing it and trying to guilt you. I think you have your doubts for a reason.", "NTA - you are showing prudence and good principles.  He shouldn't expect you, as a girlfriend, to treat him financially as if you were a wife.  You guys aren't married, and you have separate finances.  And 8 months is not so long a time that you can treat the lines of your relationship as being blurred or start banking on financial commitments now for a payoff that may or may not happen in five years.  If he's in his residency, he's smart enough to get that.  \n\n\nThat makes his refusal a red flag.  Good luck!", "I'm surprised with the amount of N T A votes.\n\nI'm sorry, I think YTA. To me it's perfectly sensible to have these discussions before moving in together, It dosnt make him seem like he's taking advantage of you. Splitting outgoings proportionally is a very fair way to manage your finances. What will happen when you have kids and want to work less, yet he's qualified and earning twice as much? Or if you get sick and can't work? Or if you decide you want to change careers. Will you still want to split everything 50/50 when he out earns you? \n\nIt's clear you don't trust him and are not ready to move in together yet if you are convinced he is just out there to take advantage of you. Relationships go through peaks and troughs and there may be times he earns more and times you earn more and you have to be able to work through that in a fair way. \n\nMaybe see how your relationship pans over over the next 12 months before considering moving in together as it does seem like you are ready for that commitment with him", "Info: \n\nHave you told him that your family and friends have all told you him and all other residents are untrustworthy golddiggers? \n\nFollow up question, if you think he's a golddigger why are you dating him?\n\nLast question, if you're still together in five years and his salary suddenly jumps to triple yours will you still stand by the 50/50 split, or will it go out the window the second he becomes the primary earner? Would you be fine with a pre-nup that completely separates your finances and earnings if he's making triple your salary?", "Info: why are you with him if you don\u2019t trust him? It sounds like your entire mindset regarding the relationship is that he\u2019s going to leave you once he gets a better pay.", "ESH\n\nMostly him. I hate how income based division of expenses has become an expectation rather than an option.  If you wanted the more expensive place that was beyond his budget then sure it would be reasonable.\n\nWhile he might be checking a bunch of the boxes that your friends and mom are warning you about, that shouldn't be the reason for wanting keep it 50/50.  \n\n>says if I\u2019m not willing to help him now I\u2019m not serious about the relationship.\n\nIt's a relationship issue at this point.

The fact that he is so pushy about it is a bit of a red flag. You're right, you don't know that you'll be together in 5 years, and you're not married. \n\nYou might push him out of the relationship early by sticking to your boundaries, but you could also grow to resent him if you don't. \n\nHonestly, I'd hold back on moving in together. It's only been 8 months! Dont move in just because you can save money. Its recipe for disaster.", "YTA - A relationship is about sacrifice and compromise. If your reason for keeping the split 50/50 is you're worried he's only using you for your money and going to leave once he starts making money I think that's the real issue. Why do you feel that way? If you genuinely think it will happen why stay with him? How would you feel if he was making 300k and still kept all finances strictly 50/50?", "NTA just keep it same until you both legally commit then discuss finances (ex: one pot of cash for one couple) then buy a house together in both your names. Good luck.", "NTA, I dated a woman who made more than I did but we still did everything 50/50. We would even alternate who pays for date nights and things like that. It's not a compromise if you aren't receiving a benefit in return. He gets a nicer place and pays less, what do you get out of the deal?", "NTA because it's a short relationship, I might just simply not move in w this person. If you ARE committed to living together I def feel like splitting rent 60-40 is fair", "YTA I do think rent should be split based on income. Having said that I wouldn\u2019t move in with him. Especially the more expensive place he wants. You\u2019ve not been together for a year yet and this 5 year I\u2019ll pay you back is crap. If you really think this relationship is love, I want to have kids and grow old together move in together. Make sure not to mingle money, Separate accounts. I would choose the place I could best afford on my own. Just in case it doesn\u2019t work out and his 5 year plan never materializes.", "YTA.  it\u2019s compromise and support.   And stop listening to your mom and friends.  You\u2019re an adult act like one. \nWhen my partner and I first lived together he made significantly more then me at the time.  We determined the percentage difference in income and that became what we each paid.  Say 60/40.   And as things changed the percentages changed.", "I'm not going to vote, but I have a question:\n\nI have paid more than 70% of all living expenses in all of my relationships. I was told every time I complained that since I made more, I should cover more.\n\nWas that inappropriate for others to require that of me?", "I'm going to go with YTA. Not because I necessarily think income-based payment makes sense in an 8-month relationship. But because I think if you have THIS much distrust of medical residents, you shouldn't date them. It's not fair to the guy you say is generous and kind and giving you no reason to distrust him to constantly treat him as though he's waiting to dump you.", "You make 120k a year and still live with your parents?

Oh we\u2019re still together now! \n\nAlso- medical students have too much studying to do to \u201cscheme\u201d on how to \u201cshack up with someone doing better.\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d give me a break lmao.", "NTA\n\nJust be honest with him and say let's get this cheaper house, split 50/50 and see how we go for a year living together, then after a year pending how you  two have gone living together perhaps we can look at a different better house together, and maybe you could be willing to pay a little more if the living situation has been great and you feel this is long-term potential?", "Dating for 8 months and moving in together? Don\u2019t worry about 5 years from now. Yes, split everything evenly.", "I\u2019m confused, since when is 60k a year barley surviving? My husband and I support a family of four in Florida for 55k. We aren\u2019t rich clearly but we are okay.", "Honestly, right now as it stands you are roommates, you wouldn't merge finances, why would you be expected to pay more then 50%?", "NTA.  \n\n\nThis one heavily depends on WHO is the one pushing for more expensive stuff in the relationship, the low earner or the high earner. If you were the one pushing for more expensive stuff and telling him to suck it up, rather than going with stuff you could both afford you'd be TA in this situation, but you're not; he just wants to have something better and not pay more for it.  \n\n\nIf he can afford 1100 a month, then go ahead and up your budget to account for that, but continue paying the same as him. That should be a good compromise. He gets something a little more comfortable, you continue paying 50/50.  \n\n\nIn the meantime though, consider how comfortable you are with him and money. This could be needless tension. It also could be a sign to explore why you feel that way and whether it's founded.", "So your family already convinced you that your husband is going to leave you and you believe them, yta", "NTA. \n\nI think couples can split things proportionally based on income, or you can split 50/50 and then you just have to budget based on the lower earner (aka, you rent a place that the lower earner can afford so they aren't struggling to pay the bills). \n\nYou are fine with a place within his budget 50/50, HE is the one that wants a more expensive place, and on your dime. Given that fact, along with your worries in general, I don't think you should move in together if you don't trust him. I don't blame you, but if you have this feeling, you need to hit the brakes. \n\nAnd while I do think partners should support each other, I think that applies in established, long term relationships, and isn't something you need to do when you are just starting out. I would only split bill proportionally with my partner if we had been together for a significant period of time or getting married. 8 months is way too early for me to be helping pay for another adult.", "YTA for the rent thing. Every single post on here where the genders are swapped you would be the asshole. You being a woman makes no difference", "NTA. Everyone is talking about how you must not trust him enough or something but I think it's totally reasonable, and maybe common sense, to not assume after 8mos that you'll still be in a relationship in 5 years, especially because you're both still young and early in your careers.", "NTA , however , with your suspicion, he won\u2019t be there in 5 years. Do you want him to think all you care about is $? Just waiting for him to screw up. He might be the one, the forever guy. Might be worth $400 per month to find out for sure. This will sound pretty cold , but if you don\u2019t give him a chance to do something shady he never will , because he never had the opportunity. On the other hand if you give him the opportunity to \u201c take advantage \u201c and he treats you good, then maybe he is actually a good guy worthy of your trust.", "You make \u00a3120k year at 26 and live with your parents still??", "INFO -\n\nAre you okay once he\u2019s making more to continue contributing 50/50?", "NAH.  It's a reasonable thing for him to ask, and it's also completely reasonable that you are not comfortable with that and said no.", "I think a great way to solve this is to get married before you move in together.", "At ONLY 8 months together it's entirely reasonable that OP is still feeling out the trust in the relationship. You do not know a person yet at 8 months.\n\nI also feel 8 months is way too early to move in together for the same reason and would recommend OP to wait with that until the relationship is better established.", "Agreed. What\u2019s hilarious is that when I was 26 (still female lol!) I was the medical student and my boyfriend (27M) was \u201cOP.\u201d \n\nWe split rent but he paid for everything else. If he had decided to make it 50/50, there\u2019s a 0% chance I\u2019d be spending money on family vacations", "Yeah this is the most reasonable take. NTA\u2026HOWEVER they really really shouldn\u2019t be moving in together. They\u2019re no where close to that stage clearly and there\u2019s no trust there.", "I disagree fundamentally solely because I have been financially abused by a partner.  \n\nMy ex fiancee made I think 28.50 and i made 13.5.  The amount of complaining she did, and bitching she did was outrageous.  I ended up picking up overtime, as much as i could, to the point that I was working months at a time with no day off, and the only reaction I'd get was a sneering \"why are you bothering, I make more on my normal salary then you do on overtime, and now I never see you.\"  \n\nI was doing most of the cooking, all of the laundry, all of the cleaning, all while working between 6-7 days a week and anywhere from 8-12 hour shifts. \n\nAnd, when she cheated on me, she blamed me because \"you were never home.  It felt like I was living with a roommate.\"  \n\nI don't play that game anymore.  Either we split bills 50/50, separate bank accounts, or I walk.  I'm not going to get called lazy when I'm working 66 hours a week compared to my partners 36, and be left wondering if I'm in the wrong because I'm so used to being treated like garbage.", "They\u2019ve been together for 8 months. He has no right to expect this of her.", "Especially when he\u2019s talking 5 years from now and they haven\u2019t even made it a year yet.", "Eh. I can see both sides to this. On the one hand, she is right to be wary of financial exploitation and it is a common scenario that could majorly mess her over if they break up down the line. On the other hand, it will be hypocritical if she refuses to go proportional to income on costs now but expects him to do so down the track when he is the higher earner.\n\nOP, I think the first thing you need to do is decide what you want the relationship to look like going forward. Are you okay with merging finances down the track/each paying a set proportion of your income into a fund for shared expenses but want to achieve a set goal post first, e.g. length of relationship, engagement, marriage, house purchase? Or are you okay with maintaining separate finances, 50/50 split going forward indefinitely? \n\nOnce you have reflected on what you want, then it is time for an in-depth conversation with your boyfriend about finances and futures to see if you can get on the same page. In addition to the above, make sure to discuss things like what debts you both currently have and you might incur in the future and how such debts would be handled going forward upon moving in together, engagement, marriage etc. Also check if you are on the same page re spending habits, what your typical budget would look like in breaking down living costs/savings/discretionary spending, and how you would handle unexpected financial situations, like a family member needing help. \n\nIt is not that there are necessarily right or wrong answers to these questions but if there are fundamental financial incompatibilities between you that neither is willing to resolve then it is better to know this now.", "As long as OP is okay with paying 50/50 if/when he makes more then I\u2019d agree", "I\u2019ve known two nurses this happened to.  Dated med students and then as soon as they were done? Poof! The relationship disappeared.", "I agree with this division, based on % is better when one person does earn a lot more. \n\nBut, to me, given that they only date for **8 months** and he isn't willing to go to another house that they both could afford, it is very reasonable for OP to decline. It's a short period of time and he is pressuring her to pay more for a house he wants.", "But they've only been dating for 8 months! Way, way too early for him to be asking her to cover his rent, and making promises to pay her back... in 5 years.", "It kind of boils down to \"Would I be willing to pay 1600 a month to live in this nice apartment.\", no matter how much the partner is or is not contributing.\n\nI am in a similar situation as a med student right now. I make 1000\u20ac a month, 670\u20ac of which go into rent. My girlfriend makes three times as much and pays the same amount. We split 50/50 on groceries and toletries, period meds and such. \n\nWe come to the end of the month where I don't have any money left, but my girlfriend still wants to go out, get boba, go shopping and whatnot. She is aware that if she wants to have that kind of lifestyle and wants to inlcude me in it, she will have to cover both of us. It normally works quite well.", "Smartest thing to do when you\u2019re young is to continue living with your parents if you can", "Oh and NTA I agree 50/50 is the way to go!", "Absolutely and I have heard of this where the wife supports him then when they\u2019re supposed to switch it ends.", "Yeah, I am not sure how much the gossip is affecting OP's thoughts on him vs how much his pushing for a better place is reminding OP of the gossip.", "Idk I think the whole situation should warrant a reconsideration oh her part, especially with her family's/friend's loud opinions about medical residents and their motivations. I don't think they'll be able to get past that and actually support OP no matter which decision she ultimately makes", "I\u2019m with you on this. Not all relationships or relationship stages are equal. Moving in with a bf/gf these days is not necessarily indicative of being like almost-engaged level commited. Most people now try living together for at least a little while *before* that stage, partly bc rent is so expensive, and partly bc they want to make sure they\u2019re even compatible living together before they make a bigger commitment. Splitting based on income is a long run plan. I mean if both people WANT to split on income super early, no judgement, it\u2019s their relationship, I just think people can be a little eager to demonize someone when they *don\u2019t* want to do that right away.", "I think I agree with you.  But I think OP is addressing this back-asswards.  They need to figure out what they are each comfortable with as a budget and work from that total.  OP should take into account that this would be shared public areas etc.  I understand approaching it as more of a room mate situation rather than a marriage as they are still in the pre-marriage state.", "It's also completely normal to split expenses proportionally, based on relative incomes.", "I think anyone talking about moving in together could bring this shit up with their roommates. I don't think she has any obligation to meet his demands so ultimately I agree", "A 50/50 split is never going to work long term in this case. He\u2019s already shown that he wants to overspend. When he\u2019s making $300K then he won\u2019t want to be living a lifestyle befitting a lower income, so either OP will be stretched to \u201ckeep up\u201d with his lifestyle (leaving her with little or no savings) or he will pick up the lion\u2019s share\u2026 or he will leave her.", "That's what got me. Like, her concern isn't completely unfounded. My mom is a CPA and financial advisor and she always drilled into us to live within or below our means. A big salary means nothing if you blow every paycheck. She has so many high-earning clients (mostly doctors and lawyers) who are effectively living paycheck to paycheck because they're paying alimony and child support to the starter wife while keeping up with the Joneses with their new 20something bride. \n\nEven without the possibility of him leaving after he starts to earn more, his whole financial attitude is still concerning.", "With non-romantic roommates a slightly higher rent for one might be offset by perks like getting the covered parking space etc.  Maybe they could work out something there.  But he also needs to listen to what she feels comfortable spending.", "What sticks out for me is that he is pushing for the more expensive place *and* asking her to pay more.", "I think the problem here is also that they are moving very fast. They are dating for only 8 months and he wants to have a good house where she pays more. 8 months is a very short amount of time.", "I mean off the information provided I would don\u2019t know if we can say he is an overspender or not. The cost of the higher priced place would be about 17% of their combined income, which does not seem unreasonable to me, but then I live in an area where spending 30% salary on rent is pretty normal.\n\nBut I do agree that this issue is bigger than just this one situation and they need to have a much fuller conversation about finances, spending habits in general if the relationship has any future. Perhaps such a conversation would make him realises he does need to budget better or adjust spending habits. Not uncommon for people who are irresponsible with money when young to change as they grow and mature, or meet someone who points out a different way to live/prioritise. But there are plenty that don\u2019t change too. Hence a conversation needs to be had, and if that reveals they are financially incompatible, she should get out now. But I don\u2019t know that we can make the decision they are financially incompatible based only off the info here without knowing more about respective spending habits outside this one situation re where to live.", "He hasn\u2019t shown that he\u2019s even thinking of leaving her. He works 12+ hours and she admitted that he goes out of his way to make time for her.", "There\u2019s also the trend of women marrying doctors so they can coast through life while nannies raise the kids\u2026 But it would be presumptuous and sexist to stereotype a doctor\u2019s spouse as a gold digger based on gender alone, wouldn\u2019t? Maybe we should recognize that the same applies for male doctors.\n\nBottom line, it\u2019s perfectly fine to be cognizant of stereotypes and our own personal risks, but being in a relationship means you have to let your guard down at some point. If OP doesn\u2019t want to do that, that\u2019s fine, but maybe she should just avoid dating doctors altogether. \n\nEither way she is NTA for not wanting to splurge on a more expensive place but I do think she is going overboard with the dogmatic views on splitting everything 50/50.", "For sure. I paid less with roommates when my room was significantly smaller or theirs had perks - like a stone fireplace. And the fact that he wants the more expensive place should factor in", "Oh, I don't think he's necessarily in the right. I just also don't think there's an automatic, magic change to the level of commitment that comes from being engaged, necessarily", "I'd be inclined to agree, especially since they have such different ideas about money and cohabitation from the get go", "Nor do I - but the biggest concern for me is \u201clet\u2019s upgrade and you pay for it.\u201d", "Yeah, especially because he also seems to want OP to pay more for a house he does want to \"help him out\" but this is very early for such commitment and to trust in a person in that way."]}
