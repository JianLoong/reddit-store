You have to keep it more secure.\n\nAlso, think about the worst case scenario there: You niece freaks the hell out because she doesn't know what's wrong with her and calls an ambulance. Think of the repercussions of that, including medical expenses and potentially authorities investigating.

Your SIL is overreacting, and it sounds like that's a common issue with her. You didn't offer Lacey weed, and you had a mature and necessary conversation with her about it and she apologized. It's unfortunate that your kids know where your edibles are, and you're going to eventually need to know how to childproof your home from teenagers so they don't get into your stash too, but it's legal and super normal to consume THC.

It would probably be traumatic.", "YTA for a few reasons:\n\nThe kids should never have know about your stash. There is no reason for them to. The THC gummies should not have been around candy.

You need to better hide your stash.", "NAH, but if your kids apparently know where to find your stash of THC edibles mixed with actual candy it needs to be hidden better. Leave your plain candy where it is as a decoy, and find a location with a proper lock to put your edibles so this doesn't happen again.", "Nta. All the people screaming cause your kids know where it is, imagine if they didn't know about it and found it one day thinking it was regular candy?! \n\nHow are they supposed to learn to leave it alone if we hide it? It's 2023 not 1923.", "NTA\n\nAll of these people screaming about how irresponsible you must be are clearly virtue signaling or don't know what they're talking about. \n\nHow many parents keep beer in the fridge? Keep spirits in the cabinet? Wine in the pantry? \n\nAll of those are restricted intoxicants, but they've been ingrained in the culture for so long that nobody thinks twice about leaving them around unguarded. You tell your kids not to touch them and expect them to listen. Cannabis is no different (except that you can't die from an overdose like with alcohol.)\n\nThe only part of this that seems weird to me is the notion that the teenager wasn't clued in at any point. First of all, who keeps regular candy stashed away in a bedroom? Most people keep candy with the rest of their food. Second, don't all edibles come with massive warning labels? Every single cannabis-infused food or drink has warning labels on the package in unmissable format. Hell, even many of the food items themselves have a little symbol *on the food!* Finally, couldn't she smell or taste it? All the chocolates or gummies I've eaten have an unmistakable flavor and odor. It's *really* hard to miss. \n\nI don't like assuming that every crazy post is automatically a lie, but if this really did happen, then the niece either ate them knowing exactly what they were or is a complete idiot.", "NTA, but if your little kids know where that stash is and pointed her to it, that\u2019s very bad.

Not well hidden, is it?\n2/ imagine if your niece had shared this in large dosages with your kids? That wouldn't end well.\n3/ you attempted to hide this from your sister in law by having your niece stay over.\n4/ you don't seem to have apologised or even admitted guilt to yourself over this.", "This very clearly didn\u2019t happen and you clearly have never taken THC in your life.\n\nIf this was real YWBTA for child endangerment.", "NTA.\n\nLet's pretend it wasn't THC candy in your closet, just normal candy. It's still a HUGE invasion of privacy to go through someone's bedroom closet just because \"I'm snacky\". She's old enough to babysit, she's old enough to know that if you're putting something in your closet, it's not to share.", "YTA mate. You created a situation where a teenager took drugs without knowledge or consent. I know you didn't do this purposefully, but ultimately you are the adult and you need to secure your drugs better if you let children run around your house unsupervised.", "ESH, except your niece and your kids. You had absolutely *zero* justification for even letting your kids know of the existence of **any** of that candy, THC or not. As they say, what you don't know can't hurt you. Also, out of sight, out of mind.\n\nYour SIL coming unglued over her daughter having a bit of pot candy was unnecessary as well. The girl shouldn't be banned from babysitting for you because that kind of thing punishes **her** for making an innocent mistake. She needs to be reprimanded instead for taking your stuff without permission, which is a universal no-no in my book.\n\nHaving said that, SIL has every right not to trust you at this point, but saying you're an addict and should be in jail is way over the top. You should always be responsible enough with your edibles that you are certain you've taken as many of the variables into consideration as possible so they don't end up in the wrong hands, period. This means keeping them completely away from any potential underaged access.\n\nDon't tell the kids the candy even exists, let alone where; lie to them if you have to and say you no longer have a candy stash, and put the stash somewhere else that the kids can't get to. Also, always have a candy stash that the kids know they can get into with permission, including when the babysitter is there. As the one in charge, the babysitter can be the one to give permission. You can have the rule that says \"candy only after all dinner is eaten\" or when some other condition is met. Simple enough. I hope this is a big learning lesson for you.", "Sorry, but you didn\u2019t do a good enough job at keeping these out of the reach of children.

Lock it up or somethihf, you can buy smell proof lock boxes everywhere. \n\nDont be so irresponsible.", "Yta how irresponsible are you that your children know where you keep your drugs?", "YTA. Not because you had pot in the house. But because it was unlabeled.  Frankly with teens in the house, keeping both alcohol and pot under lock and key isn't a bad idea.", "Small YTA, take this as notice that it's time for you to buy a box that locks.  Your kids are well aware of your stash already.", "That just sounds unlucky. I don\u2019t think anyone really truly sucks here besides Lacey\u2019s mom. Her behavior is over the top but coming from a place of protecting her child from substance abuse. You should probably keep that side of your life less visible to your kids if they know about the \u201ccandy,\u201d even if they dont know what it is. If they ever decide they want some and youre not there to stop them, you will have a fair amount to regret.", "Yta wtf you also say \u2018candies i keep from my stinking kids\u2019 not referring to edibles.

You may have put the edibles where your kids couldn\u2019t reach them but you didn\u2019t hide from them where they are.  You didn\u2019t tell the person you left in charge that you had them and not to go near them.  There is no way that your niece would know that they weren\u2019t just regular sweets.  It\u2019s the same thing as guns.  When you have them in the house they are your responsibility.  Period.", "You need to clarify here - did Lacey intentionally take your drugs, or did she think they were regular candy. It sounds like Lacey thought she was raiding your stash of regular candy, and got a surprise.\n\nFrom your description, this one's on you. Lacey told your kids she fancied some sweets. Your kids told Lacey where you keep your sweets, and she ate some. Where in this process was Lacey supposed to get the information \"these aren't the gummies you're looking for\"?\n\nYTA\n\nYou don't necessarily have to lock them up, but keeping them in a bag next to a bag of regular candy is just asking for trouble. Just keep your stash in a tin or jar or something in a different cupboard from your candy, and you're good.", "YTA - You do need to lock up your drugs, especially if they are in the form of actual candy.  I can't tell if Lacey knew they had THC in them or really thought they were candy, but it doesn't matter.  You are the problem.", "NTA. The kid got into your stash. It happens. You didn't give it to her or even offer it. It was put away out of reach. She is not an asshole except for taking it without permission. Her mom is kind of a jerk but I can see her point.", "NTA but your SIL has a point, OP.\n\nI don't think you are a drug addict nor a bad person but when you have edibles in your house you really have to be careful with where you put them. The fact that your own children KNOW the stash exists, even if they think its regular candy, is dangerous and a problem.\n\nIn this scenario is not your fault that she had the THC, you didn't force her, nor tricked her in any way, shape or form. But if you have a harmful substance such as drugs in your house, legal or not, you need to make sure everyone is safe from them so a misunderstanding like this one doesn't happen again or they can produce serious lasting damage.\n\nAgain, NTA but I'd say you are being a bit negligent.\n\nEDIT: Which kinda makes the negligence worse. THC is not supposed to make you act like your niece did. That is most likely because there another drug in your stash that your are not aware of. Maybe as a mistake, maybe because of cross-contamination, who knows.\n\nEDIT 2: To adress the comments. So? It's still dangerous for a kid to have access to THC edibles, even more so if what you are saying is correct and THC makes people have reactions like thinking their phone is a remote. If I was factually incorrect in the first edit I apologize but that's literally not the point.", "YTA - but a big part of the problem is the packaging looks like candy. Anyone could mistake it as candy. It needs to be changed. I know other countries require different packaging.", "ESH. Your niece was definitely wrong for pillaging your stash, but you also stored a controlled substance where it was accessible and apparently not clearly marked. I'm not going to fault you as much for not having it locked up (we have booze in the house and my kids know not to touch it) but the gummies need to clearly be labeled in some way.", "NTA, although kinda stupid. If your kids know about it they will eventually get into it. Buy a lockbox.\n\nHer mom has a right to freak out a bit, this scenario could have gone very wrong a couple different ways. Luckily it didn't. But calling you an addict and saying you should be in jail is eye-rolling. Still, you are legally liable here. Watch your back bc she may choose to do something.", "If you keep your stash hidden why do your kids know exactly where it is? And why not tell them its candy for adults? Maybe you should label things or tell the babysitter that \"hey there is this thing\". Because there are tons of cases where they could be found/consumed. Also you seriously underestimate the creativity of kids when they want something. Eventually they will find a way up on that closet. YTA. Getting a locked box is not that hard", "YTA.

OP's gummies look like regular gummies, and if they aren't labelled there is no way for niece to know what she was taking.  \n\nKids saying \"Mum keeps candy on the top shelf of her closet\" isn't always obvious; it could quite conceivably be kept there so mum can keep an eye on how much the kids get.  And normal for the kids to say \"Mum says we can't have any candy without asking her\" too, how many parents want to keep an eye on their young kids' sugar intake?\n\nAnd it's normal to say to the babysitter \"help yourself to food / drinks\", so no it isn't rude for niece to have some candy that the kids aren't allowed, because teenagers can control their sugar intake better.  \n\nSo yes, I do think YTA OP.  All you had to do was tell your niece that you have gummies in your closet so that she knew they weren't normal candy.  Instead what happened was a high teenager was left in charge of your kids.
