We do go back to visit my grandparents and what not but this year, they came to us.    \n\n\n  \nI live in a small, 2 bedroom house with my parents. I'm an only child so I get one room to myself and my parents get the other. This isn't enough space for my grandparents plus my uncle and his wife and kids. My grandparents booked a hotel near to our house but my uncle is too cheap for that. He wants ME to give up my room for his kids while he and his wife sleep on an inflatable bed beside them in my room. I explained that I have sleeping issues and would appreciate keeping my room. He kept insisting and annoying my parents about it till they finally caved in and told me to sleep on the couch in the living room. I didn't want to give up my room, so when night time came last night I rolled my bed to the door and locked it for extra security so they couldn't get in. OF course, they were upset and tried to get more to open the door and let them in but I didn't budge. I kept my room for the entire night.  \n\n\n  \nMorning time, I wake up expecting a shit show. Basically, I got yelled at for having a 'tantrum' and not making a small sacrifice. I understand what I did seems like a tantrum but I don't feel like they are entitled to my room. I pointed out that my grandparents got a hotel and that they could have done the same.

They are 15, children are supposed to be taken care of by their parents free of charge... fix your traumas ppl and be honest. The living room was good enough for the uncle and his family.", "Ehhh... \n\nMaybe it's a cultural thing, but I remember shuffling rooms, adjusting, laying down spare mattresses, etc. to accommodate guests and family visiting.  That meant giving up the bed for a night or two so folks that traveled many miles to visit you have a nice stay, and maybe they come again in the future.  This is for no reason other than to maintain that close familial relationship.  And when it was in the inverse, they'd do the same.\n\nThat said, I can understand you wanting to keep your room.  Maybe you have a porn stash, fragile items, whatever you don't want folks messing with.  Maybe it's as simple as you don't want someone else sleeping on your bed.  At the same time, I don't know how old their kids are, and maybe they need to be watched in an unfamiliar environment, and that's why they wanted the room.  Also, I'm not sure if the couch and an inflatable is enough to bed four? people.  \n\nYou can ask to keep your room and have a discussion with your parents.  Ultimately, it's up to them to respect your stance or not.  Blocking off the door so nobody can use it does seem a bit childish and immature, however.

Hospitality is one of them, we have encased ourselves in our self importance.\n\nIn ancient Greece hospitality was really important and the God protecting that was ... well non other than Zeus, the father and king of the Gods at the time. That's why he was also called Xenios Zeus.\n\nXenia is an ancient Greek concept of hospitality. It is almost always translated as 'guest-friendship' or 'ritualized friendship'. It is an institutionalized relationship rooted in generosity, gift exchange, and reciprocity. Historically, hospitality towards foreigners and guests was understood as a moral obligation. Hospitality towards foreigners honored Zeus Xenios (and Athene Xenia), patrons of foreigners.\n\nRead a bit about Xenia and Zeus if you want. There was this rumour that Zeus could appear on your doorstep as an old man and if you didn't offer hospitality then you would be punished.\n\nAll that is not a story about how you should be afraid, but of the importance of hospitality.\n\nYTA, I mean except if you had exams or something (in which case your relatives would have come at another date) then you can sleep at the living room for some days. It is worth it to leave your room to accommodate a whole family. You will maybe not sleep the best, but the joy and the happy memories make up for it.\n\nINFO: what sleeping issues do you have?\n\nAlso \"I pointed out that my grandparents got a hotel and that they could have done the same.\"\n\nYou don't know that.

It's not YOUR room or YOUR house, it is your parents. You have the room to yourself because they choose to give you that room. When you move out, they will repurpose the room to suite them. If THEY moved out, you'd have to move out to, because it's their house. So yes, you were acting like an entitled child throwing a tantrum. \n\nYour uncle and his family were entitled to your room the moment your parents told them they could stay there. You should have respected their decision as both your parents AND as the owners of the house. End of story.\n\nThese situations put a lot of pressure on the host homeowner (the parents). Culture and family dynamic will determine what is expected. You are calling your uncle cheap, but you do not know his financial situation. You do not have any financial responsibilities. Your uncle does. Your parents do. Moving ONE child out of their bedroom to allow FOUR people (two adults and 2 children) to use that room sounds like a pragmatic solution. Having four people sleeping in the common rooms or expecting your parents to give up their bedroom so that a 15yo child doesn't have to move is selfish on your part. We can debate what your parents could have or should have done, but again, the bottom line is when they TOLD YOU to let your uncle and his family use the room they allow you to have, you should have let them.", "Amazing how the current pulls in these threads.\n\nI'm going to say YTA.

It was actually a lot of fun to have family come from out of town. We were excited to sleep out in the living room and wake up to breakfast with relatives. Had some great memories. Was a very small sacrifice that didn't seem like a sacrifice at all. We loved getting to spend time with family we hadn't seen in a long time. Spent all day playing with cousins and had a great time.

That's entitlement. It was very nice of your parents to allow them to stay in your home. \n\nMaybe this is just me, but when I've gone to visit friends or family in other parts of the country or in other countries, I've been perfectly fine to sleep on couches or blow up mattresses or whatever accommodations.

I haven't been to my family in years due to the cost of the travel, and when we DID visit, we were so glad to have beds to sleep on- because it was lots of long, drawn travel time (waiting in airports, sleeping in airports while holding bags, waiting in train stations, taking trains, sleeping in trains, going through immigration, more train/plane...) by the time we got to a family member's house, we'd feel sore all over but just so happy to visit. No, we couldn't afford hotels- we were already stretching funds as much as possible with the cheapest travel options/layovers. Sure we could have slept on the floor, but when family members made the effort to let us get a night on a mattress in between parts of the trip, it was a relief. And a sign of caring.

Every. Single. Time.\n\nI HATED it & never really felt like my room was mine. I felt like I was allowed to stay there at my parents leisure - same as any guest. A child should NEVER be made to feel like a guest in their own home. I got a daybed for Christmas when I was a teenager. I had been wanting one for years & it was the only thing I got that year. I still refused to accept it unless my parents promised to stop evicting me from my \u201cown\u201d room to allow other people to sleep in it.

You have a lot to learn, and I hope one day you get the revelation I got from having a sibling and friends snapping reality in my face to show how spoiled I was. You probably don\u2018t understand the concept of sharing either. I grew up not well off, but the family picked up along the way (hence the additional sibling).
