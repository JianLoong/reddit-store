Your wife is looking after your interest.", "NTA\n\nAnd stop helping with his house remodel.  He doesn't deserve your help.", "Not sure where you live but your insurance doesn\u2019t cover an unlicenced driver here. You\u2019d be an idiot to put him under yours. And if he says you\u2019re not friends but you can continue working on his house it better be damn well paid, and paid well. You\u2019d be an idiot to do that for free.  He\u2019s not a friend, he\u2019s a user. Grow a backbone.  NTA.", "NTA. You would be foolish to add him to your insurance policy. I\u2019m not even certain that\u2019s legal? I don\u2019t think you can insure someone who can\u2019t drive, and if he\u2019s an illegal driver then not only would the policy not cover him if he was at fault in a wreck but if someone were killed or seriously injured because of him you could be legally and financially liable. It\u2019s incredibly presumptuous of him to ask this of you. He should worry more about taking care of his child support and less about what you can do for him. \n\nSays a lot about him that he tells you straight out you are not his friends but he still wants free labor out of you. You are much better off without him.", "He can afford a house remodel but not unpaid child support? He was on his daughters insurance??

Could there be a common denominator here? Him? \n\nAnd unless you agree to their demands you\u2019re not considered a friend, so it\u2019s transactional? \n\nHe was the one who made this choice.", "NTA if your house insurance is tied to your car insurance would he be able to pay you guys back if something happens?", "NTA. \n\nImagine if he had an accident while driving on your insurance. Imagine if another party was injured. You could be sued into oblivion. I\u2019m talking total loss of your cars, your home, your world, your everything. Is some dude that owes back child support really worth that?", "\"I'm losing a long term friend because I took my wife's opinion into consideration.\"\n\nNo. You're losing a friend because he is taking your refusal to break the law and jeopardise your own insurance as a personal slight. \n\nYour wife, according to you here, gave no opinion, she understated a fact: \"it's not smart\" and left the decision up to you: \"do what you must\". You decided what to do, not she.\n\nSo, NTA for refusing to do something illegal, but you are an ass for trying to blame your wife for your decision.", "NTA.  Aside from your own liability exposure (which wouldn't be a good idea in the first place), I'm not so sure your insurance company would simply add him.  I was just recently shopping for auto insurance for comparison sake, and the companies I called in my State asked for driver's license numbers so driving records could be checked.  If this is your case as well, it's a non-issue.  \n\nNext step is he asks to borrow your car.  Don't give in.", "NTA I would be hard-pressed to add anyone not in my household onto my insurance much less someone unlicensed and unrelated. Too big of a risk.", "Contractor here. OP drop his ass and stop working on his house.", "ESH cept your wife. You think that your friend has license issues because of unpaid child support. Ok let's pack that away. Your upstanding friend was previously on his daughter's insurance policy. Did I read that right?!? If so then he definitely is behind on child support payments. And he also probably owes his daughter money. Not sure why you even needed to involve your wife in this decision because it is painfully obvious to me, with the little information that you have provided, that your friend is a complete ahole. Why are you even stressing over this and posting here?", "It's understandable that you want to help your friend, but it's also important to consider the potential consequences of adding an unlicensed driver to your insurance. Depending on the terms of your policy and the laws in your state, you could be held financially responsible if your friend is involved in an accident while driving your car.\n\nIt's also worth noting that your friend's reaction to your decision is not appropriate. It's not fair for him to try to guilt-trip you or question your friendship just because you're not willing to take on this risk.\n\nIt might be helpful to have a conversation with your friend and explain your reasoning in a calm and respectful way. You could acknowledge that you understand his frustration, but also express your concerns about the potential consequences of adding him to your insurance.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide how much risk you're willing to take on, and it's important to prioritize your own well-being and financial security. It's possible that your friend may need to find another solution for his transportation needs, but that doesn't necessarily mean that your friendship has to end.", "NTA\n\nYou never add someone else to your insurance who is this foolish! I'm sure your insurance would deny him based on the fact that he hasn't had a license for years.\n\nThe responsible thing to do would be to take your wife's opinion into this matter because she is tied to your insurance and helps pay for it too (I assume).\n\nThis man is hardly a functioning adult. The dude doesn't pay child support and doesn't have a license, BUT he can afford to remodel his house???", "NTA. Your friend is lashing out due to frustration. Just invite him over for beers around a fire pit and ask if you guys can be friends again. \n\nHe\u2019s been driving illegally, doesn\u2019t that void the insurance coverage anyway?", "Lol, \u201cyou can still help him with work.\u201d How nice of him! He doesn\u2019t have a license, so he shouldn\u2019t be driving. NTA.", "NTA. Your wife is right. Watch Judge Judy and you\u2019ll understand why you did the right thing in saying no. Your friend is not a true friend, nor a responsible, good person. He wasn\u2019t even responsible to his child(ren), so there\u2019s no way he won\u2019t screw you over.", "NTA..\n\nI\u2019m sorry OP, but Jay is not your friend to run a guilt trip on you because your wife is smart enough to realize putting an unlicensed driver on your insurance is a very, very bad idea.\n\nIf he no longer considers you his friend, then you shouldn\u2019t have to help him with his remodeling.. I\u2019m sorry you feel you\u2019re losing a friend, but he\u2019s a user\u2026", "YTA for putting this on your wife when she gave wise advice and then LEFT IT UP TO YOU.

Maybe i'm ignorant, but I don't understand how your friend can insure *his* car that is driven by *him* with no license on your insurance. If anything happened that required an insurance claim, it would not be covered unless you were willing to say you were driving his car, if you could even do so (no witnesses, etc). \n\nIn my experience, anyone dodging child support to the point of a suspension of their license is used to attributing their problems to other people.", "NTA. Tell him that you will help after he pays the estimate for your work. You are no longer friends, so why should you help him renovate his house for free?", "NTA\nThis is pretty clear cut, and it's time to cut ties with him if that's truly his opinion. Pack up your tools and spend the time you just saved yourself on something you value. The icing on the cake here is that even after his child turns 18, his debt isn't just going to magically disappear if it was handled through the courts and he is behind. So if he was banking on that... oh well. Move on and let him solve his own problems... with one less person to help.", "NTA\n\nYour supposed friend is a user. Have you been helping him for free? Stop. He doesn't appreciate it or you. He's not licensed. If he gets in an accident your insurance would cancel you and you'd play hell and high premiums getting insurance again. \n\nHe is no friend to you.", "Nta.
