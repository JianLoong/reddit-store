Jesus Christ. \n\nMy family and I 23f went to Italy this past week for a vacation. It was my parents, my 17 year old sister, my aunt, and 27 year old cousin. It was a mostly good time, pretty hot out, but the art was cool and I was excited about that. \n\nOur flight home was three connecting flights, Venice to Montreal, Montreal to Toronto, and Toronto to my home city. That\u2019s a lot. It was a 30 hour day. My aunt and cousin got on a different flight out of Venice since they both live further away. \n\nMy parents have hated each other since I was 11. They almost got divorced when I was 13, but changed their minds, and will never let me forget that \u201cstaying together for the kids\u201d meant that I\u2019m the reason they\u2019re so miserable now. They sure do love to tell me that. \n\nAnyways. Our flight delays, we have to sprint through Montreal, customs takes forever and my parents suck at technology. My dad snapped at my mom, my mom snapped back, my dad started flirting with the flight attendant and some other lady in the airport, my mom shut down and almost didn\u2019t get on the flight home, and they had been screaming- loudly- at each other for everyone in the Toronto airport to hear. It was embarrassing. \n\nI\u2019ve been in and out of therapy for over a decade now dealing with their bullishit because they won\u2019t go, and I end up being the collateral every time they would fight in front of me. (So every day my entire childhood.) \n\nBut while we were waiting to board, my dad starts chatting up some lady in front of my mom, who texts me this. \n\n\u201cIf Your boyfriend treats you badly, you can break up.  I have no option like that.  Dad is now enjoying his second conversation with a second single woman since we left Italy and hasn\u2019t had one polite conversation with me. Just demeaning ones. I have no options like you did.\u201d \n\nSo I snapped, and yelled at them BOTH, \u201cStop acting like children. This is not appropriate to do in front of me and my sister. Either go to therapy or get fucking divorced. I\u2019m tired of being your collateral every time you are at each others throats.\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s more really shitty things that they said to each other that I can detail in comments if y\u2019all want. But they both laid into me for embarrassing them. As if they weren\u2019t fully doing it to themselves. \n\nI was on hour 30 of no sleep, I was hungry, and I was about to get on my third fucking flight of the night. I don\u2019t live with them, I have my own place, but for the past year any time they do this shit I just up and leave. Unfortunately not possible in an airplane. They\u2019ve both been laying into me for embarrassing/disrespecting them since the incident and idk. Maybe they need to get embarrassed in an airport. This shit can\u2019t be normal. But maybe I\u2019m playing victim like my mom says. I don\u2019t know.", "created_utc": 1688051230, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14m7f8j/aita_for_telling_my_parents_to_get_divorced_in/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re 23 and your sister is 17? You\u2019re both old enough to manage mommy and daddy splitting up. They cannot use you both as an excuse to justify their misery anymore (and shouldn\u2019t have from the beginning). \n\nSounds like tensions were high and EVERYONE was running on 30 hours of no sleep. Perhaps that\u2019s why they were both acting like children? Not that it\u2019s an excuse, but I think everyone in this situation was stressed to the max and coping with it differently. NTA regardless though. They both need help. Or better, divorc\u00e9 attorneys.", "esh. Just refuse to go on any vacations with them anymore. It's not worth your mental health.", "Where can I watch this movie? The Hallmark channel?", "NTA. Your parents embarrassed themselves and are blaming you. You can't fix them and it's not your responsibility to. Though Italy was I am sure wonderful, I suggest no more family vacations with them both and strictly limiting all other contact. Think of how amazing it would be to look at beautiful art without being anxious about the next screaming fight.\n\nNo contact is an option too, and one I have employed with awful family members. It is bliss for me to be out of the drama triangle. You'll know if it's the right choice for you if it sounds like it would reduce your stress, not raise it. If you're still seeing a good therapist, they can help you with stronger boundaries and reducing/eliminating contact.", "NTA. *You* embarrassed *them*? That's rich.\n\nYou're correct that they should not be acting like this in front of their children. Or in public generally. It is so inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, I would feel so uncomfy if an obviously married man who was in a fight with his wife, was trying to flirt with me at the airport, with kids right there too! What a dick move honestly. I feel bad for the women your dad tried to drag into that mess.", "You don't live with them - why would you, knowing how they are, travel with them?  Go NC and tell your sister she can come live with you when she's 18 and ya'll can get therapy together.\n\nYTA - you didn't have to go!", "NTA. \n\nYour parents are selfish and inconsiderate. This is not staying together for the kids, this is making sure the kids feel unappreciated and unhappy. So sorry for you OP.", "Gentle ESH. Your parents are obviously AHs, but very rarely is snapping and yelling acceptable behavior, no matter how stressed or sleep-deprived. Once you've all calmed down, it might be worth sitting them down one at a time and then together to tell them how their actions are affecting you. Ultimately you are an adult and do not have to put up with this if you don't want to OP.", "Drop them like the plague , for a while for your own mental state just maybe don't answer them ignore them cause they seem draining , I suggest take a vacation from the vacation  to not dwell on this and say you not gonna deal with them if they can't behave like adults and not 5 y olds .", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They sound horrible to be around.", "Tell them it's not 1950 anymore, and nobody cares if they get divorced. It's no longer a stigma, and they are both not doing anybody any favors by staying together. If anything , they are driving their children into therapy. \nYou say you have a sister, how old is she? If she is over 18, tell them it's time for the divorce that absolutely everyone wants. There are no more children to hold them back. They no longer have \"the children\" as an excuse. Also go low to no contact until they ARE divorced.\nTheir misery isn't the children's fault and it's time they stop holding you responsible.\n\nNTA by the way.", "NTA\n\nEveryone has a limit. They finally pushed you past yours. This is on the pair of them and no one else.", "NTA. I'm sorry you and your sister have to deal with that, it's really unacceptable. Your mother is the one playing the victim, texting you that bullshit instead of taking responsibility for her own life. Your dad sucks for obvious reasons.", "Tbh that might be my next step. The stress of it throws my health out of whack for weeks. I thought about backing out of this trip, but man oh man I really wanted to see the Sistine chapel ceiling. And the Florence cathedral. And Laoco\u00f6n and his sons.", "Move on in, chuck. Take my place at the family vacations.", "because I obsess over the art there and ALSO my mom would have texted me whether I was there or not. I\u2019ll be just chilling at work and she\u2019ll hit me with the \u201cwhen you get married get someone who actually cares about you and doesn\u2019t make your life miserable\u201d etc etc when we haven\u2019t talked in days.", "Like I said, i normally just leave. But we were in a different country together for a week and navigating an airport as a unit. There\u2019s not much escaping that.", "My parents stayed together for the kids. I have like 2 friends whose parents were divorced since middle school. Guess who has childhood trauma and who doesn\u2019t!", "They\u2019re both really active in the church and I think they\u2019re worried about the shame they\u2019ll get if they do get divorced. Which, fair. They go to a megachurch where everyone knows each others business. \n\nPersonally if I was a little more feral I\u2019d hit up my old pastor with my \u201cprayerful concerns\u201d or some bullshit so they can get peer pressured into marriage counseling or something but idk. Wouldn\u2019t take much to convince me to do it though.", "Also my sister is 17. They keep saying once she graduates they\u2019re gonna move back to their hometown state. I fucking hope so. Get outta here.\n\nSometimes when they\u2019re too much for her she\u2019ll come stay at my place bc we live in the same city. But yeah I\u2019m an adult, she\u2019s nearly an adult, it\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t been in therapy 10 years already, what\u2019s another year to process the divorce. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "But that has to be your next step. If therapy taught me anything it is that I cannot expect others to change. I can focus on myself. You can write them a letter telling them how their actions are affecting you and you need to go low or NC for a while. But let them know that change is up to them. You are not acting the victim. You are a victim and refuse to put YOURSELF in that situation any longer. The joy of travel is quite often who is with you to experience the wonder of it. \n\nI have had perfectly shitty vacations made fun and memorable with the right companion. And perfectly beautiful places ruined by the attitude of others. Be there for your sister. Disengage with their fights.", "Your parents are just like me! I think we would get along very well!", "Was there an option not to go on the trip in the first place? Why would you want to spend time with such a dysfunctional group?", "Definitely go that route, then. There is nothing like church pressure. Also, have your younger sister \" confide in the youth pastor\" about her concerns for when she goes to college and they will be alone.", "Go the church route to pressure them into counseling. There's nothing like a concerned youth pastor to get the peer pressure going. \nIf you can afford to have your sister stay with you, maybe see if she can find a part-time job closer to you, so there's an excuse for her to stay at yours more often.\n\nGood luck to you and remember, this is not your or your sister's fault.", "My Dad did the exact same thing on a plane, hitting on the flight attendant in front of my mother. I was sitting between them. It was excruciating. I really hoped they'd split up, then my Dad got sick and my mother took care of him for years. Literally wasted years of her life care-giving for a man that treated her like crap. Tell your mother to leave before she finds herself looking back and realizing she'd wasted her life on a bad human being.", "You're very attuned and brave to call out your parents like this. You're right, you shouldn't be caught in the crossfire. And your folks are so caught up in their misery, they've lost sight of the harm they're causing you. Good for you to stand up to that. If you were my kid, I'd be proud of you for this.", "lmao if the Chuck McGill redditor is identifying with my parents maybe they are really fucked up", "and like, I\u2019m a 23 year old grad student. I\u2019m poor as fuck. Probably won\u2019t get to go to Italy on my own dime. But my dad has a good pension and they do vacations. But man oh man I got to see my favorite building. Love that Fuckin building.", "because I\u2019m a /whore/ for art and we were going to the Vatican museum and the Florence cathedral. That\u2019s the whole reason. Literally all of it. Not even Catholic. But I love that shit.", "Hell yeah, I hope you had a great time seeing it all!"]}
