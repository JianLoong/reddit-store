Jesus Christ. \n\nMy family and I 23f went to Italy this past week for a vacation. It was my parents, my 17 year old sister, my aunt, and 27 year old cousin. It was a mostly good time, pretty hot out, but the art was cool and I was excited about that. \n\nOur flight home was three connecting flights, Venice to Montreal, Montreal to Toronto, and Toronto to my home city. That\u2019s a lot. It was a 30 hour day. My aunt and cousin got on a different flight out of Venice since they both live further away. \n\nMy parents have hated each other since I was 11. They almost got divorced when I was 13, but changed their minds, and will never let me forget that \u201cstaying together for the kids\u201d meant that I\u2019m the reason they\u2019re so miserable now. They sure do love to tell me that. \n\nAnyways. Our flight delays, we have to sprint through Montreal, customs takes forever and my parents suck at technology. My dad snapped at my mom, my mom snapped back, my dad started flirting with the flight attendant and some other lady in the airport, my mom shut down and almost didn\u2019t get on the flight home, and they had been screaming- loudly- at each other for everyone in the Toronto airport to hear. It was embarrassing. \n\nI\u2019ve been in and out of therapy for over a decade now dealing with their bullishit because they won\u2019t go, and I end up being the collateral every time they would fight in front of me. (So every day my entire childhood.) \n\nBut while we were waiting to board, my dad starts chatting up some lady in front of my mom, who texts me this. \n\n\u201cIf Your boyfriend treats you badly, you can break up.  I have no option like that.  Dad is now enjoying his second conversation with a second single woman since we left Italy and hasn\u2019t had one polite conversation with me. Just demeaning ones. I have no options like you did.\u201d \n\nSo I snapped, and yelled at them BOTH, \u201cStop acting like children. This is not appropriate to do in front of me and my sister. Either go to therapy or get fucking divorced. I\u2019m tired of being your collateral every time you are at each others throats.\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s more really shitty things that they said to each other that I can detail in comments if y\u2019all want. But they both laid into me for embarrassing them. As if they weren\u2019t fully doing it to themselves. \n\nI was on hour 30 of no sleep, I was hungry, and I was about to get on my third fucking flight of the night. I don\u2019t live with them, I have my own place, but for the past year any time they do this shit I just up and leave. Unfortunately not possible in an airplane. They\u2019ve both been laying into me for embarrassing/disrespecting them since the incident and idk. Maybe they need to get embarrassed in an airport. This shit can\u2019t be normal. But maybe I\u2019m playing victim like my mom says. I don\u2019t know.\n\nETA: update, mom called. She very much expected me to apologize for \u201cairing out her dirty laundry.\u201d I told her I was just calling them out for embarrassing me. And told her a lot of the things you guys said. That this isn\u2019t the 1950s, and seeing them hurt each other hurts me. It went nowhere unfortunately. She went on and on about how I\u2019m a child and should never speak to my parents in this way. I reminded her. I\u2019m 23, 24 in a month. Not a child. I fully support myself. She doesn\u2019t care. It\u2019s like in her mind I\u2019m fully subject to all of her wants and needs, just  because she gave birth to me.", "created_utc": 1688051230, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14m7f8j/aita_for_telling_my_parents_to_get_divorced_in/", "score": 2867, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Now. \n\nNTA\n\nETA. This isn\u2019t your job to fix. You\u2019ve said your peace and I suggest you leave it. They are two grown assed humans. Let them sort their own stuff out - or not.

I, too, made the mistake of vacationing internationally as an adult with my parents who should be divorced. I relate strongly to this and have made similar comments to my parents. \nMy only advice is to ask your therapist how to establish strong boundaries with your family and practice it. Maybe be ready to breakdown some generational trauma with your sister when she gets out on her own. \nBest of luck to you!", "NTA the absolute worst thing any parent can do is stay together for the sake of the kids. It does nothing but mess the kids up majorly.

They both sound pretty awful.  Their behavior over the past decade is absolutely child abuse.  I'm glad you're in therapy to cope with the trauma.\n\nHow does your sister feel about your public outburst?  How do you feel about going no-contact until they can be adult parents?  They'll be angry at you and no doubt both turn on you, at least for a while.  Can you deal?  Does sis have an exit strategy, moving away for college maybe?", "NTA my parents moved to another country when I was an adult and it was obvious to any random passer-by in the airport that my dad didn't want to go... but he went, and guess what? They ended up getting the divorce they should have got when I was 8, but so much messier because they couldn't communicate. I wish I'd said in the airport that my dad should fucking stay. \n\nTell them to do a trial separation - each of them gets the house for a week whilst the other doesn't take a holiday but stays in (maybe not an Airbnb but something like that...) in the same city, and try to imagine what life would be like without the other. Are their routines better? Are they happier? \n\nIdk, it's not really your response, and I'm sure they won't listen, but if you give them common-sense advice and they ignore it then you can absolve yourself at least.", "NTA OP, and the audacity of your mum to be saying you're playing the victim when she sent you that text playing the victim. You were right, they should divorce rather than living in misery and forcing everyone around them to be privy to it.", "Nta", "It sounds like the only thing they agree on is shitting on you.

They are not willing to make change in their lives, with an excuse that is no longer valid as you are not a child - and you are an easy scapegoat for their frustration. \n\nIn one of your comments you noted that they may be fearful of church shame. Yelling, flirting with other women, blaming your child for your actions etc. is not very Christian (or whatever religion) of them.  \nThis is going to suck...but you need to sit down with your parents and tell them what you are observing and feeling.  They are no longer going to entertain their comments, your mom is able to leave - your father can leave, but if they are not willing to, then they need to stop having these discussions in front of you.   \nYou may need to be blunt, and it will be hurtful, and tell them that by 'staying together for the kids', they actually did more damage of what a healthy relationship is, they have put adult relationship issues on your shoulders and you have built resentment towards both of them that you hope can be addressed. \n\nYou can also let them know that while you do not want to go low or no contact, if they cannot address some of these issues or start working towards an actual solution - whether that is divorce or counselling - you will be limiting your time with them together.

We told her that we were unhappy and miserable watching her being treated badly and that he never tried to be a father figure to us.  And since she worked at GM, what financial security was she talking about since she was basically paying most of the bills and he took his paycheck to buy himself new suits and to party?

I stayed with them for a week last year, and it was the best it's ever been with them. But also I don't think I can handle being around them more than a week. I feel like they would be happier separated.", "Your parents are a nightmare and we feel really sorry for you. Clearly NTA and you didn't do anything wrong in the airport.\n\nHowever, if I wanted to be harsh, I'd say YTA for going to Italy with them. You're in your mid twenties now, I'd be doing nothing with them ever at this point. Or institute a policy where you only see them separately, like for dinner or something. Separate vacations. That way you'll never have to witness a fight in person again. Maybe if you get along with your sis, take her on vacation as a break from the nightmare that is your family.\n\nI'd personally pull a reddit cliche favorite and go \"no contact\" with them until they agree to go to therapy, and or get divorced, or at the very least, stop abusing and blaming you and others for their dysfunction.\n\nMy parents were like that too. Fighting in public and everywhere, but if anyone did it but them, we were an unhinged embarrassment to them.", "Now I\u2019m just imagining someone arguing with security, \u201cwhat do you mean I can\u2019t bring my lawnmower on the plane! I bought it a ticket!\u201d", "Yeah I can't believe reddit is advocating church pressure. The same pressure that has ruined millions of lives.", "\"It's my emotional support lawnmower! It has papers!!!\"", "I think that depends on the church. But yeah if the church says that, you can\u2019t depend on the church to get the parents to divorce."]}
