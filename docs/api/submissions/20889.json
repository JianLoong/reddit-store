Jesus Christ. \n\nMy family and I 23f went to Italy this past week for a vacation. It was my parents, my 17 year old sister, my aunt, and 27 year old cousin. It was a mostly good time, pretty hot out, but the art was cool and I was excited about that. \n\nOur flight home was three connecting flights, Venice to Montreal, Montreal to Toronto, and Toronto to my home city. That\u2019s a lot. It was a 30 hour day. My aunt and cousin got on a different flight out of Venice since they both live further away. \n\nMy parents have hated each other since I was 11. They almost got divorced when I was 13, but changed their minds, and will never let me forget that \u201cstaying together for the kids\u201d meant that I\u2019m the reason they\u2019re so miserable now. They sure do love to tell me that. \n\nAnyways. Our flight delays, we have to sprint through Montreal, customs takes forever and my parents suck at technology. My dad snapped at my mom, my mom snapped back, my dad started flirting with the flight attendant and some other lady in the airport, my mom shut down and almost didn\u2019t get on the flight home, and they had been screaming- loudly- at each other for everyone in the Toronto airport to hear. It was embarrassing. \n\nI\u2019ve been in and out of therapy for over a decade now dealing with their bullishit because they won\u2019t go, and I end up being the collateral every time they would fight in front of me. (So every day my entire childhood.) \n\nBut while we were waiting to board, my dad starts chatting up some lady in front of my mom, who texts me this. \n\n\u201cIf Your boyfriend treats you badly, you can break up.  I have no option like that.  Dad is now enjoying his second conversation with a second single woman since we left Italy and hasn\u2019t had one polite conversation with me. Just demeaning ones. I have no options like you did.\u201d \n\nSo I snapped, and yelled at them BOTH, \u201cStop acting like children. This is not appropriate to do in front of me and my sister. Either go to therapy or get fucking divorced. I\u2019m tired of being your collateral every time you are at each others throats.\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s more really shitty things that they said to each other that I can detail in comments if y\u2019all want. But they both laid into me for embarrassing them. As if they weren\u2019t fully doing it to themselves. \n\nI was on hour 30 of no sleep, I was hungry, and I was about to get on my third fucking flight of the night. I don\u2019t live with them, I have my own place, but for the past year any time they do this shit I just up and leave. Unfortunately not possible in an airplane. They\u2019ve both been laying into me for embarrassing/disrespecting them since the incident and idk. Maybe they need to get embarrassed in an airport. This shit can\u2019t be normal. But maybe I\u2019m playing victim like my mom says.

If she is over 18, tell them it's time for the divorce that absolutely everyone wants. There are no more children to hold them back. They no longer have \"the children\" as an excuse.

If therapy taught me anything it is that I cannot expect others to change. I can focus on myself. You can write them a letter telling them how their actions are affecting you and you need to go low or NC for a while. But let them know that change is up to them. You are not acting the victim. You are a victim and refuse to put YOURSELF in that situation any longer.

Why do you put yourself in this situation?", "NTA\n\nNot only did they act like this in front of you and your sister, they did it in public.

Now. \n\nNTA\n\nETA. This isn\u2019t your job to fix. You\u2019ve said your peace and I suggest you leave it. They are two grown assed humans. Let them sort their own stuff out - or not. You need to concentrate on healing from this eternal shit show and supporting your sister in her healing.", "NTA. I, too, made the mistake of vacationing internationally as an adult with my parents who should be divorced. I relate strongly to this and have made similar comments to my parents. \nMy only advice is to ask your therapist how to establish strong boundaries with your family and practice it. Maybe be ready to breakdown some generational trauma with your sister when she gets out on her own. \nBest of luck to you!", "NTA the absolute worst thing any parent can do is stay together for the sake of the kids. It does nothing but mess the kids up majorly. I\u2019m so sorry you have to deal with it but I\u2019m glad you\u2019re able to escape that, hopefully your sister will go the same route as soon as she\u2019s able to as well.", "NTA. They both sound pretty awful.  Their behavior over the past decade is absolutely child abuse.  I'm glad you're in therapy to cope with the trauma.\n\nHow does your sister feel about your public outburst?  How do you feel about going no-contact until they can be adult parents?  They'll be angry at you and no doubt both turn on you, at least for a while.  Can you deal?  Does sis have an exit strategy, moving away for college maybe?", "NTA my parents moved to another country when I was an adult and it was obvious to any random passer-by in the airport that my dad didn't want to go... but he went, and guess what? They ended up getting the divorce they should have got when I was 8, but so much messier because they couldn't communicate. I wish I'd said in the airport that my dad should fucking stay. \n\nTell them to do a trial separation - each of them gets the house for a week whilst the other doesn't take a holiday but stays in (maybe not an Airbnb but something like that...) in the same city, and try to imagine what life would be like without the other. Are their routines better? Are they happier? \n\nIdk, it's not really your response, and I'm sure they won't listen, but if you give them common-sense advice and they ignore it then you can absolve yourself at least.", "NTA OP, and the audacity of your mum to be saying you're playing the victim when she sent you that text playing the victim. You were right, they should divorce rather than living in misery and forcing everyone around them to be privy to it.", "Nta", "It sounds like the only thing they agree on is shitting on you. I'd stop talking to both of them, honestly. There's no excuse to treat you like that. NTA.", "NTA they CAN break up they\u2019ve just chosen not to.", "NTA.  Your parents behavior is unacceptable, and their \"marriage\" is insane.  Somebody needed to say what you said to them a LONG time ago.

They are not willing to make change in their lives, with an excuse that is no longer valid as you are not a child - and you are an easy scapegoat for their frustration. \n\nIn one of your comments you noted that they may be fearful of church shame. Yelling, flirting with other women, blaming your child for your actions etc. is not very Christian (or whatever religion) of them.  \nThis is going to suck...but you need to sit down with your parents and tell them what you are observing and feeling.  They are no longer going to entertain their comments, your mom is able to leave - your father can leave, but if they are not willing to, then they need to stop having these discussions in front of you.   \nYou may need to be blunt, and it will be hurtful, and tell them that by 'staying together for the kids', they actually did more damage of what a healthy relationship is, they have put adult relationship issues on your shoulders and you have built resentment towards both of them that you hope can be addressed. \n\nYou can also let them know that while you do not want to go low or no contact, if they cannot address some of these issues or start working towards an actual solution - whether that is divorce or counselling - you will be limiting your time with them together. That being blamed for their relationship failings (and it is only a failing because they are not addressing it) is no longer going to be placed on you - and you will not be their lightning rod.", "Honestly at this point I'm surprised you talk to either one of them.

Guessing that is the last family vacation!", "Why do they/you go on vacation together?", "NTA baby, NTA", "Nta but also you don\u2019t need to handle their marriage or their divorce!", "Wow, that airport announcement must've been a real \"flightmare\" for everyone involved!", "NTA. Just go NC already!", "NTA. My parents hated each other, but they wouldn't get divorced because they're Catholic. There were years where they just didn't speak to one another, at all. One of them called me on the phone, in a different time zone, to tell me to tell the other something... I was like, I'm done. You can tell them yourself!", "I went on a long international flight last year with one layover. I was probably awake for 24 hours from hotel to home. I\u2019m pretty chill normally, but I had a small panic attack trying to get my luggage at my home airport. No sleep, crammed in a tiny space for hours, and then the long lines for customs and the luggage\u2026it was all too much and it kind of made me never want to travel internationally ever again. So I don\u2019t blame OP at all for yelling when dealing with the bickering parents on top of travel stress.", "I\u2019ve done it my whole life. I almost didn\u2019t go on this one, but they said they would pay my way, and I\u2019m so obsessed with all the art and architecture in Florence, Vatican etc that I went. It\u2019s my favorite thing to talk about. I\u2019m far from religious but I just have so much interest in things like the Sistine chapel, School of Athens, Laoco\u00f6n and his sons, St Peters Basilica, Brunelesschi\u2019s dome on the Florence Cathedral, all the images of the Divine Comedy and Dante\u2019s Inferno\u2026 I could go on forever. It\u2019s my passion. I get to go see these things all expenses paid. But this was the worst my parents have ever, EVER behaved on a trip. It ruined a lot of the experience for me. I hope someday I can save up a pretty penny and re visit these places and make better memories.", "You know, you can keep your distance. Be there for your sister, but limit your contact with them. You need to look after your mental health, and being around THAT isn\u2019t going to make it easier for you. I think your only concern at this point should be your sister, and getting her out once she graduates HS. Once she\u2019s off to uni or whatever, just keep your distance. And maybe don\u2019t travel with them again.", "God. The divorce would be a fucking celebration. More like a year to process why they were willing to make you suffer and take so long to do it.", "I am glad you are there for your sister. I am truly glad she has a safe place/escape. How are you two smarter and more mature than your parents. Something is backwards here haha.", "Do the church take kindly to people flirting away Infront of their spouse and family?", "Do it. Honestly the way they're acting should be just as much if not more shameful in the church as a legal divorce. They're basically divorced in all but name. This isn't helping anyone.", "Why am I not surprised at all that these are megachurch people?", "Do it OP. Since neither parent will listen to the concerns of their goddamned children, perhaps a little church-lead shaming will do the trick. Y'know, since they're more concerned with how they are perceived by the church community than the health and well-being of their family.\n\n  \n\n\nDrop the hammer, go low/no contact and enjoy your life. NTA.", "Well, there\u2019s your problem. The church.", "Use all the tools in your toolbox. \n\nYou know their audience; play to it.", "> They\u2019re both really active in the church...\n\nWell... there's your problem right there.\n\nI knew someone that got divorced and one thing they said was that their kid was so grateful. That the kid noticed both parents just be happier in general and just suddenly be better people. She actually liked them more after the divorce. She even liked her husband better after the divorce.\n\nOn the other side, an ex was from an extremely religious family and her grandparents at best were indifferent to each other or outright hated each other. I was with her for 3 years and I'm not even sure I ever saw her grandparents say one word to each other or really stay near each other when they I saw  them. They always had a grandkid or two between them at church, which could be nothing or a major sign and I knew they didn't sleep in the same room. They didn't scream at each other but even for an uptight and proper religious community, there was never any sign of affection between them at all. At their best I could describe their relationship as similar to coworkers that didn't like each other but professionalism was important to each.", "Don\u2019t worry about feral.  Just talk to the Pastor anyway about the situation so he can peer pressure them.", "You are seeking the advice of another adult, one who your parents trust, to help save their marriage or your sanity. \n\nThat\u2019s a GOOD thing.", "For some reason I read lawnmower instead of layover and just wanted to ask how and why...", "That doesn't really answer my question.  Let me rephrase.\n\n\"I stuck my hand into a fire that's been burning me since I was 11.  It burned me.  I yelled at it to stop burning me.  AITA?\"\n\nWhy did you stick your hand in the fire again?", "Is there any reason for you to go on the family vacations? I know a trip to Italy is nice, but at what cost? I'd get fed up with this sort of carry-on pretty quickly.", "You can't afford it on your own? If not, save until you can. You sanity is worth it.", "Good god.", "Only if it's a priest and a child.", "Well, yeah, but I can\u2019t make them leave. They still take issue with me leaving. I mean, whatever, they can\u2019t make me go to church or believe anything but I also can\u2019t make them see how bad their megachurch is. I still might hit up their pastor though. Mans got billboards all over my city he can\u2019t be that hard to grt a number for yknow", "Haha, I imagine that would be an even worse experience!", "Not even close lol I live paycheck to paycheck. Once I finish grad school I\u2019ll be on a teachers salary which is not much. I\u2019ll find a rich gf or somethin idk", "You can just call the church office, if it's a megachurch they'll have a phone tree and receptionist and be able to direct you to the right place to share your concerns \n\nYou might not get anywhere with it, churches are weird about the strangest things and might think their behavior is fine, but it's 100% not and you're NTA and that sounds absolutely insufferable to deal with. Especially your mom claiming she has no options like she isn't a whole ass adult with the ability to make her own damn choices", "Okay, that\u2019s fair. It sounds like this was a calculated decision- missing the trip or dealing with family drama. I still don\u2019t think what your parents did was cool but it sounds like you knew what you were getting into as well", "Usually I do and usually I can handle it. But between the text my mom sent me and hearing her tell my dad \u201cI don\u2019t know why you booked this stupid trip if not to be your last hurrah before you abandon your family\u201d is FAR beyond anything they\u2019ve ever said. \n\nMy sister is adopted and this trip was partially to celebrate her Italian heritage. We are all German, and we have family we visit in Germany sometimes, but she doesn\u2019t feel that same connection. And I mostly just feel bad for her. She\u2019s just a kid, man. She has a different level of indifference to it since she can\u2019t remember a time when they loved each other while I can. And I can just drive away, when she can\u2019t. I feel guilty for leaving her in those situations. But I can\u2019t handle it.", "I\u2019m sorry, OP. Hopefully you and your sister can be there for one another and be a complete, supportive, family unit together. You don\u2019t need to keep toxic people in your life but you can be a positive influence on your younger sibling for sure."]}
