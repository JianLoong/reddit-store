As you said, that's expensive. If this specific case, you are also correct that your daughter's transition to kindergarten is important. \n\nHowever, could just you go and she stay with your partner?", "NAH you can't make any sort of plans until things are confirmed", "NTA: She's changed the date numerous times. Odds are she'll do it again. You haven't mentioned if she's upset about it, so this may not even be a big deal.", "NAH. This is the problem with having to travel for a wedding. It\u2019s to be expected that not everyone will be able to attend. I\u2019m confused why your partner is so insistent that you go?", "NTA\n\nNothing to be explained here, kids and their important transition phases come first, your partner needs to shut up.\n\nAlso, going by how things have developed so far, I'll suspect the wedding won't be before 2025, so no worries.", "Info: does your child attend daycare or preschool, or is she home with a parent all day? Because the transition to kindergarten might not be that big of a deal of she's already used to being away from the house every day.", "NTA\n\nWhen someone has a destination wedding, I read between the lines they don't want many people to go. It should also be assumed many people flat out can't afford to go, especially in current times.\n\nOnce upon a time destination weddings were for rich people, and they provided travel and hotel for invited guests. If you can't provide that, as a couple they need to decide what's more important for their wedding, the location or who attends.", "Ugh\u2026. This is a tough one. I get why it would work but man, not going to her wedding is rough and could change your relationship forever. Definitely no assholes here.", "I'm gonna go YTA, gently.\n\nThe wedding is (supposedly if they don't change the date again) 9 months away, that's more than enough time for you to make arrangements so you can attend your sisters wedding.\n\nYes kindergarten is is big transition, but missing a couple of days isn't going to hurt anyone so that you guys can attend the wedding.", "YTA in terms that it may likely impact your relationship with your sister. You have the right not to go to your sisters wedding. If you are both the black sheep it will likely impact your relationship with your sister. A kindergartner can miss a handful days of school the first month.", "ESH. She sucks for being a really, really poor wedding planner. I think you suck for prioritizing kindergarten more than a family wedding. I know you might think your child\u2019s life will be measurably worse in some way if you disrupt their kindergarten experience, but I really doubt that is true.", "Unless she's really into Catalan independence, or a huge fan of the local football club, the choice of her wedding destination is utterly bizarre. Barcelona is lovely, but it's not the only lovely place on Earth.\n\nI don't know what your sister is trying to prove, but you're NTA here.", "NTA. Someone who plans for a destination wedding must take into account that there are those who do not have the time or funds to attend. It\u2019s incredibly selfish to expect it.  Most people I know who have destination weddings have a second reception for those unable to travel abroad.", "NTA  Your explanation is perfectly legitimate.  Your kids needs to understand that school is important not to miss and starting by pulling the child out of school to travel doesn't set a good foundation.", "I'm going to say a gentle YTA, it sort of depends on what your values around family weddings are \u2013 especially if you're close to your sister, in my opinion you should make the maximum effort to go no matter how annoying she is about it. You may feel differently, but so it goes. A lot of people do fly to Europe and back (or America and back) just for weddings. \n\nIf you can afford it, it seems like your partner can take care of the kids for the weekend. Destination weddings are expensive, of course, but if you don't go it will 100% be interpreted as you not caring. I would say that it's reasonable for your partner or kids not to go however.", "NTA. That sounds really expensive. People come up with these destination weddings without thinking about their guests.", "1st day of Kindergarten wins, every time. NTA", "NTA but you can try harder. Not saying you do not have valid reasons, but your reasons (besides the money part) just seem small in comparison to a wedding for your sister you say you are close to. Maybe ask if you can get some help on the money side. You SO seems to be willing to help so surely they can watch a baby and kid for a couple days while youre there. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you end up not going you do need to talk to your sister about it in detail and make sure she understands your side.

Shocking, but in my state they are fighting for more than a 30 minute recess for kids in elementary :(", "Getting mad or upset when people can't/won't to your destination wedding is an asshole move. Your wedding becomes a very unnecessary expense and burden for the guests.", "Kids always, always come first.", "Honestly, OP seems kind of exhausted at the constant pushbacks and vagueness of it all so that may be a factor and I can't fault her for it.", "Tell me you don't have kids without saying it \ud83d\ude09", "Yes paying for everything, no he really thinks I need to go", "Bluffing on this sort of thing is foolish.

No, ofc not.\n2. It would be if it didn't conflict with a delicate transitioning phase.

And unlike a wedding, a kid's life cannot be rescheduled.", "And still with no dates confirmed, and several previous flops as is, would it really be a big deal for sister to do the wedding the weekend after school starts? And yes, kindergarten transition is MAJOR for a toddler, whether they remember it or not. Potty training was more important, and we don't remember that either \ud83d\ude02 \n\nI personally find destination weddings rude to people. I said in another post, as a couple decide what's more important to you. Where you took a picture and said some words, or who was there for it.\n\nGet married with your family there locally, and fly off to your honeymoon the night of. Worked that way for a loooonnngggg time before people ONLY started caring about themselves and their feelz.

But it\u2019s not \u201ccorrect\u201d or the only good way to parent, and to act like it must be done that way by everyone is weird. There are so many good options here, not sure why OP has to see this as such a limited/bad situation.", "That is the thing, it\u2019s like the first couple weeks of getting acquainted with school, which I\u2019m already nervous about with my ball of energy kid-if it literally was October I would probably do it, it\u2019s just pulling them out one of the first 3 weeks of kindergarten would be a lot.", "No dates confirmed so even more of a reason to try and make it work rather then flat out say no before you even know when it will be..... What if its over summer or another break? Or even in the middle of the spring semester?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou just went off on how it was rude and selfish for a destination wedding, and then you list what YOU want in a wedding.... Do you not see the irony there? Does everyone have to go by your staple of an acceptable wedding? OP said her and the sister were black sheeps so clearly they arent big on family, you know being the outsiders and all....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI said OP wasnt the Ahole but she can try harder to make it work. Thats not unreasonable, and youre trying to come off as a family person so wouldnt you want to preserve your relationship with your sister youre close with?", "I would take my kids places. Not when they're just starting a new school or smth, cuz it'd be too much disruption, but after they settled in, sure, all the way. IMHO. That said, I don't plan on having kids.", "That is exactly how I understood the initial post. And yes those few first weeks are very important to get the kid settled into the class, so they can start bonding with new friends and learn the routine.", "Since when is it ironic to have an opinion and personal preference, especially when they both line up? Lol. I didn't say that's what THEY should do. I clearly said to decide what's more important to you as a couple, where you have the wedding, or who is there.\n\nDoesn't mean I can't have a judgement of the matter, especially when people are trying to have their cake and eat it too. \n\nIf it's equally important to have your sister there as it is to get married in Barcelona, then change the day, as it seems extremely maleable anyway, and pay the flight and board. This is how destination weddings even started, by rich people that could afford to pay their guests flight and hotel.", "\u201cChange the day\u201d we just went over how there are no dates planned yet\u2026.\n\nIt\u2019s ironic because you say it\u2019s rude and selfish then list what wedding you want to attend\u2026..", "Ah I see what you're saying now. I mean of course I have an opinion on the way it could/should be done to accomodate and appease everyone. I do recognize not everyone feels that way. \n\nWhich is why you should expect with a destination wedding, a massively small turnout unless you're footing the bill. Decide what is more important to you.", "It comes off as OP and sister are the only real family each other have, and it seems like the sister is wanting a small wedding. But if OP is the only family of the bribe that can be there even more reason she should try harder to make it happen. Yes it could not align even after they jump through hoops to make it happen but at least she tried rather then saying it\u2019s a important year for kindergarten without even knowing the date yet.", "More I talk to you, more I feel OP feels the way about DW's as I do, and is just trangressing the emotions/justifications elsewhere \ud83d\ude02"]}
