Ben was getting irritated by it and admitted to being close to ending it but she became fine as soon as i introduced her to Lea. \n\nI always assumed she felt less threatened cause i was in a relationship but i realise now its because she must have just assumed i was a lesbian. Since that point Katie was a lot nicer to me and even tried to be friends. I was nice to her for Ben's sake but i've honestly never liked her because of when we first met\n\nSkip to now about 10 months later, we\u2019re all in a bar and the topic of celebrity crushes comes up.

She tells me to leave and looks for backup but no one gives it and after many more very personal insults about my looks etc Ben makes her leave with him. \n\nI was pretty unphased by this and ngl we all laughed about it after they were gone.
