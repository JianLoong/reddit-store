You're not rewarding them for doing absolutely nothing. It was a thank you dinner as you both agreed on.", "NTA. The inlaws want a participation award when they didn't even participate, and are mad they don't get one. Heck FIL by refusing to lend his tools based on \"you didn't listen to me so I'm not helping you in any way\", basically ran away from participating lol.", "A battle of stubbornness.

What is worse, is that they clearly rely on your partner for things, so my guess is they believe \"family helps family\" and will likely say something about the importance of family when pressuring you to include them, but they didn't have that energy when you were buying and moving in to your new home. \n\nStick to your guns about the party in January, which is a thank you for people who helped with the house.

Are you saying you won't let your partner host a dinner for his parents in his own home? I understand not throwing them a thank you dinner when they were so petty. I get that. But if your partner wants to do the majority of the work hosting, why can't you sit down to a dinner for your partner's sake? Do his parents suck? Yes. Yes they do.

You sound like you think you were entitled to help.  You don't have to invite them to a \"thank you\" dinner but you made it clear that you aren't open to hosting them to a non-thank you dinner either.  They can do a walkthrough only. Thats not about thanking other people, that's being vindictive towards your inlaws.", "ESH, you for being petty and exclusionary (albeit not without good reason), your husband for allowing his father to take advantage of his time and money, and your IL's for not helping as they told you they would. \n\nJust have a normal housewarming party and give a special toast to those who helped by name. Best of both worlds.", "I get what you\u2019re saying but you\u2019re going to win the battle & lose the war. Inviting parents to dinner is a very small effort/gesture on your part that means a lot to the parents.  Do you still want to borrow those tools for one of the many projects that come up in the course of home ownership? Does your husband contemplate asking for his dad\u2019s advice or help doing any of those projects? Your husband sounds pretty capable, but there are many projects where having a capable partner is a big help. If you take a hard line now, don\u2019t expect to borrow tools or get help in the future.

But if you want to be especially petty and stir the pot, invite them to the big dinner. Give a toast and list everyone's individual contributions towards helping with the house, making it glaringly obvious they did nothing. Or thank them as well for their unwavering dissapproval of you buying a house in 2022 and how it inspired you to do it anyways. Then just watch the chaos ensue.", "NTA the dinners have a purpose and it is to say thank you to the people who were there for you and helped you when you needed it.

Especially after you mentioned, that your husband helps them with task, and his father with his business on his day off and pay for meal for his workers without getting any type of reimbursement, but FIL couldn\u2019t put away his pride to let his son borrow some tools. It\u2019s like they chose the hill to die on, but refuses to deal with ramification.\n\nIn my opinion, you\u2019re not doing anything wrong, they are not banned from the house.

And that\u2019s that.", "NTA but is this really the hill to die on?\n\nYou said it yourself the thank you\u2019s are a mix of get togethers and 1:1 dinners. Why can\u2019t you invite the in-laws over for just a dinner, no thank you?\n\nYou\u2019re not in the wrong but just consider if you think it\u2019s worth worsening the relationship over it.", "YTA.\n\n>Is that just super petty of me?\n\nYou say you're not entitled to anything, but you are being very entitled and hypocritical.", "YTA. This makes no sense.", "YTA. You sound kind of entitled. It\u2019s your house do what you want, but when they decide to up your petty, you can\u2019t say anything. \n\nI also think there\u2019s more to the story.

So what happened?", "EOS  An old phrase \"Two wrongs don't make it right.\"  So they disagreed and are being disagreeable about the  whole thing, yet you are adults that made up your own mind and bought a house.  Sincere Congrats on that.  Doesn't stop you all from being family.  And trying to work past it, after all there is nothing either of you can do to change the situation.  Excluding them from holiday celebrations, no matter how you label it, is just spiteful.  Same as he was when denying use of the tools.  Which you aren't entitled to, btw.  Are you genuinely willing to create a mountain out of this?", "That\u2019s so petty lmfao \ud83e\udd23", "LOL!

It never ever went lower, save for like a week in 2020, and that wasn\u2019t \u201clow,\u201d it was just lower than the month before, which was still almost double what I paid.

However, you could still have a house warming party without gifts.  You are being as petty as your in laws and this is your way of calling them out to everyone because they didn\u2019t contribute.  I hope it\u2019s worth it.", "I can assure you that\u2019s not the case. It\u2019s why we were really grateful - bc we didn\u2019t ask for or need the help.

I just might be wrong on this, and if I am, feel free to let me know.  But this stinks of something that I have observed in great detail for two decades.\n\nYou're doing a thank-you celebration for those who actually helped.  However, I think I detect just a smidge of dysfunction in your partner's family.  They act very, very much like my husband's family, as a matter of fact.  This is a bit more than just his parents being unreasonable and difficult.  There's dynamic going on here, one that centers on control and \"appearances\".\n\nFirst, their son disobeyed their advice, and the punishment was that they refused to help out in any way, despite previous promises on the contrary.  (The promises themselves might have been a future carrot dangled in your partner's face if he did something now for his parents...Something like helping out for free on weekends.)  Perhaps they were hoping that since they were not obeyed, then you could not buy at all without their financial help, or that your renos would be shabby without their construction expertise or the use of specialty tools for trimwork, etc.  In short, they thought denying help that they had previously promised would result in failure.  (And what a blow to their pride when you both succeeded despite them.)  You might not see it that way, if you weren't raised in that household.  But I can assure you that their son knows exactly what his parents are doing.  And if he's trying to bend your ear to host them anyways, then what he is trying to do is avoid future \"punishment\" for not doing things his parents' way.  Yes, HE will be exposed to even more crappy behavior if his parents do not get their way.  And they will do it even as they demand/guilt trip more of their adult child's time and \"help\" with the family business.\n\nYour partner's parents are attempting to get their son to focus on \\*them\\* and their supposedly hurt feelings as a way of distracting attention away from their own pettiness; you can't be so focused on their cruddy actions and your own sense of betrayal if you're too busy trying to placate them for being excluded...And they do this to create a bargaining chip, they're pretending to be hurt because there is something they actively and desperately want:  an invitation to the get-togethers they heard about.  The underlying reason?  It's all about \"appearances\".  Here you are, inviting all these people, including your own parents and relatives, as a group thank you, and your partner's parents are conspicuously absent.  They know that at the gatherings, everyone who contributed to your homebuying/home reno experience is present.  Your partner's parents' absence absolutely screams to everyone else that they did not help their own son at all despite having the means to do so, and this puts your partner's parents at risk of being judged, both now and at later multi-family gatherings.  And that defeats a cardinal rule in a dysfunctional family:  cruddy things can happen, but no one, NO ONE, outside of the family is supposed to suspect a thing.  **Abusive personalities love to present a thin veneer of normalcy to those they with whom they seek to be on an equal social footing (or those to whom they wish to appear as being from a higher social standing).**  In this case, their presence at the thank-you gatherings gives the appearance that they, too, contributed, even though they actually went out of their way to be both ugly and unsupportive.  Their presence at the get-together says that surely, they contributed \\*something\\*, they are just as good as everyone else at the gathering, and they have an equal right to be there...Despite them doing the exact opposite.  It's creating the appearance of being \"good\" and \"respectable\" and \"generous\" and sharing in their son's success, even though they have absolutely no right to do so, and even though your partner and you have absolutely no obligation to do so on their behalf.  Thus, the \"hurt feelings\" charade.  They're trying to create an emotional obligation where none exists.  It's a manipulation, one that they have no doubt used in the past with your partner.  (If it had not worked in the past, they wouldn't be trying to pull that stunt this time, as well.)\n\nDo you understand what I'm saying?  And do you understand how poisonous this dynamic is, both to your partner and to you long-term?\n\nAnd as someone who has also dealt with that sickening type of dynamic, I am going to urge you to not invite them at all, because you are under no obligation to pretend that they have a right to be at a gathering where you are expressing gratitude for others' help.  They did not help.  But it sure sounds like they want to pretend to others that they did.\n\nNow, they might show up uninvited anyway (expect it since they know when the function is happening), and if they do, I fully urge you to open the door wide (no sneaking them in discreetly) and say as loudly as you can, \"Well, look who dropped by unexpectedly, everybody!   It's my partner's parents!  (Still loud, but to the parents) I'm sure you know we're having a get-together with people who have helped us make our house a home, we weren't expecting you two, but that fine, that's fine, I can still show off to you how much everyone else did for us.  (Mom!  Come here!  I'd love if you'd walk with me while I show everything!)  You can sure stay if you can stomach all the bragging I'm about to do.  See this gorgeous furniture my family financed for us!  Look at all this quality work that your daughter did!  Isn't it awesome?!   Our new home is a dream!  It's amazing how much everyone else did to help your son and me make this happen!  We are SO grateful for them all!\"  Get loud.  Heap on that praise.  Get a little cheerfully obnoxious.  Make sure every eye is on you as you perform.  And I guarantee that your partner's parents will hastily excuse themselves and scuttle right on out of there before anyone asks them, or you, what THEY did.  After all, you just blew their little deception wide open.  They're not going to want to stick around, your actions will say loud and clear that they were neither invited nor expected to be part of the celebration.\n\nYour doing this will send a very pointed message:  you won't be used to help them hide who they really are, you won't be bullied, and you won't let them get away with emotionally abusing or manipulating you.  This is very important:  what you allow them to do once, they will keep doing.  Do not try to do it subtly, or behind closed doors.  Keeping secrets might not be good in your partner's family.
