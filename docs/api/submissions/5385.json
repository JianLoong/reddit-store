They then a few years later moved onto small semis and her parents were still advising her to wait until house prices fell. Ourselves and her other friends moved onto larger semis and detached houses and house prices still continued to rise.

Except you change your mind If he wants to host/cook/clean up after then that's on him....they set the precidense and have to respect that they're not entitled to free home cooked meals and invites. You're not rewarding them for doing absolutely nothing. It was a thank you dinner as you both agreed on.", "NTA. The inlaws want a participation award when they didn't even participate, and are mad they don't get one. Heck FIL by refusing to lend his tools based on \"you didn't listen to me so I'm not helping you in any way\", basically ran away from participating lol.", "A battle of stubbornness. Both kinda petty.  After his tool comment, I would probably say \u201cwhy can\u2019t you just be happy for us?\u201d though.", "NTA. \n\nThe Dad owns a construction company and relies on your partner for help sometimes, and you had to do renovations, and he didn't help, declined to let you borrow tools AND told you no because you didn't listen to them about when to buy. \n\nBut now of course they want to enjoy your house and be included in the celebrations.\n\nYou are right that you aren't entitled to anyone's help, but first, you are only hosting people who have helped to thank them, so of course you wouldn't include them. What is worse, is that they clearly rely on your partner for things, so my guess is they believe \"family helps family\" and will likely say something about the importance of family when pressuring you to include them, but they didn't have that energy when you were buying and moving in to your new home. \n\nStick to your guns about the party in January, which is a thank you for people who helped with the house. After that, of course have them over like you would any other family, and tell your partner after the party in January, if he wants to host them for dinner he can plan it; of course you will come and help, but he can take the lead in putting it together.", "I wanna say N T A because I get it, but let's be honest - you specifically formed the meaning of this party to exclude them as opposed to having a normal housewarming and now you're dealing with the backlash of that. Which means that you're going to have to offer some sort of compromise with your husband who is caught in the middle of this, since you're not -  YTA.", "Wait. Are you saying you won't let your partner host a dinner for his parents in his own home? I understand not throwing them a thank you dinner when they were so petty. I get that. But if your partner wants to do the majority of the work hosting, why can't you sit down to a dinner for your partner's sake? Do his parents suck? Yes. Yes they do. But they're still his parents, he's allowed to love them. As long as he's not pushing all the work of hosting onto you, just show up and eat dinner.", "YTA.  You sound like you think you were entitled to help.  You don't have to invite them to a \"thank you\" dinner but you made it clear that you aren't open to hosting them to a non-thank you dinner either.  They can do a walkthrough only. Thats not about thanking other people, that's being vindictive towards your inlaws.", "ESH, you for being petty and exclusionary (albeit not without good reason), your husband for allowing his father to take advantage of his time and money, and your IL's for not helping as they told you they would. \n\nJust have a normal housewarming party and give a special toast to those who helped by name. Best of both worlds.", "I get what you\u2019re saying but you\u2019re going to win the battle & lose the war. Inviting parents to dinner is a very small effort/gesture on your part that means a lot to the parents.  Do you still want to borrow those tools for one of the many projects that come up in the course of home ownership? Does your husband contemplate asking for his dad\u2019s advice or help doing any of those projects? Your husband sounds pretty capable, but there are many projects where having a capable partner is a big help. If you take a hard line now, don\u2019t expect to borrow tools or get help in the future. YTA", "Sounds like you are not inviting them out of spite but think you found a convenient cover story. YTA", "Based on what you've described, yeah YTA.  They're still family and you yourself stated you weren't \"asking for help\" so how can you then turn around and say we're excluding you from thank you dinners for people that helped without asking?", "YTA really are bound and determined to make your relationship with your in-laws contentious, huh?", "NTA if the parties are a thank you to those who helped, but do you really want to cause a rift with your in-laws?", "NTA but if he wants to invite them over he can host and cook for them.", "NTA. But if you want to be especially petty and stir the pot, invite them to the big dinner. Give a toast and list everyone's individual contributions towards helping with the house, making it glaringly obvious they did nothing. Or thank them as well for their unwavering dissapproval of you buying a house in 2022 and how it inspired you to do it anyways. Then just watch the chaos ensue.", "NTA the dinners have a purpose and it is to say thank you to the people who were there for you and helped you when you needed it. I understand they were trying to provide their opinion, but at the end of the day you\u2019re all adults you\u2019re allowed to make your own decisions. \n\nRegardless, if you guys didn\u2019t take their advice or not, they are being so stubborn about the whole situation. Especially after you mentioned, that your husband helps them with task, and his father with his business on his day off and pay for meal for his workers without getting any type of reimbursement, but FIL couldn\u2019t put away his pride to let his son borrow some tools. It\u2019s like they chose the hill to die on, but refuses to deal with ramification.\n\nIn my opinion, you\u2019re not doing anything wrong, they are not banned from the house. They\u2019ve seen the home and got to take a look. And that\u2019s that.", "NTA but is this really the hill to die on?\n\nYou said it yourself the thank you\u2019s are a mix of get togethers and 1:1 dinners. Why can\u2019t you invite the in-laws over for just a dinner, no thank you?\n\nYou\u2019re not in the wrong but just consider if you think it\u2019s worth worsening the relationship over it.", "YTA.\n\n>Is that just super petty of me?\n\nYou say you're not entitled to anything, but you are being very entitled and hypocritical.", "YTA. This makes no sense.", "YTA. You sound kind of entitled. It\u2019s your house do what you want, but when they decide to up your petty, you can\u2019t say anything. \n\nI also think there\u2019s more to the story. There\u2019s a reason they choose not to help? So what happened?", "EOS  An old phrase \"Two wrongs don't make it right.\"  So they disagreed and are being disagreeable about the  whole thing, yet you are adults that made up your own mind and bought a house.  Sincere Congrats on that.  Doesn't stop you all from being family.  And trying to work past it, after all there is nothing either of you can do to change the situation.  Excluding them from holiday celebrations, no matter how you label it, is just spiteful.  Same as he was when denying use of the tools.  Which you aren't entitled to, btw.  Are you genuinely willing to create a mountain out of this?", "That\u2019s so petty lmfao \ud83e\udd23", "LOL! It would be great if they invited the inlaws and welcomed them with a huge banner that said \u201cthanks for nothing! This is all in spite of you!\u201d", "Specially the not lending tools they were not using. That's petty", "Yeah, my house has doubled from what I thought was an already insane price when I bought it 8 years ago. It never ever went lower, save for like a week in 2020, and that wasn\u2019t \u201clow,\u201d it was just lower than the month before, which was still almost double what I paid. I couldn\u2019t afford my place right now, even though I\u2019m making more. I thank god everyday that in a fit of panic I bought something that I thought would work for me long term because I\u2019d be SOL. \n\nIt\u2019s sort of like having kids. It\u2019s rarely the \u201cperfect time\u201d but it\u2019s also really easy to wait too long.", "I love this idea but it would sour the whole experience for everyone else as well. No one like tension. \n\nI would say they could come to dinner on a different day but they have to bring the food/ pay for catering. OP just bought a house and can\u2019t afford to fed the masses. I\u2019d love to hear the in-laws excuse on why they can\u2019t at least bring dinner.", "What kind of parents don\u2019t lend tools to their children just because they disapproved of them buying a house at that time?", "Bingo. That is the impression I got. She sounds super bitter. And if her husband helping his parents then talk to him. Truth is she is upset she never for financial assistance but is covering it with a thank you dinner.\n\n\nYta stop being so petty.", "We don\u2019t want to have a housewarming bc our friends are a scattered but also bc we don\u2019t want gifts bc we want to thank them.", "Thank you, but just to clarify. He did ask to borrow some tools (they were extras that the father no longer uses for work, but just keeps in the garage) and he said no.", "For me, it\u2019s bc we didn\u2019t ask for any of our friends\u2019 help and they did it any way that makes them so generous and why I very much want to thank them.", "That would be so beautiful. I\u2019d pay some money to see that show lol", "Incredibly stubborn and proud people\u2026", "I don't think we have the whole story truthfully. Sounds like they may have bought more than they could handle and we were relying on the friends and family to help them out.", "Thank you. I did mention that they have been over (just no dinner), and we will eventually have them over for dinner but I don\u2019t want to invite them to the dinners for specific people that helped, nor do I want to cave and plan a special dinner in January.", "You have received gifts and help with the house, therefore, it would be tasteless to ask for gifts at a house warming.  However, you could still have a house warming party without gifts.  You are being as petty as your in laws and this is your way of calling them out to everyone because they didn\u2019t contribute.  I hope it\u2019s worth it.", "I can assure you that\u2019s not the case. It\u2019s why we were really grateful - bc we didn\u2019t ask for or need the help. They generously gave their time and money, completely unsolicited.", "That\u2019s a fair point. Some people say \u201clend tools\u201d when they mean show up with your tools and do all the work.", "Ok so your going to make the situation worse by being petty?\n\n\nHow does your husband feel about this?\n\n\nAre you prepared to ruin your relationship with them over this? I personally really try to let the small stuff go. The last thing I want to do is continue the bad behavior by retaliation. \n\n\nYou need to think about your husband and your own relationship with them.

Be the bigger person.", "Just because someone has something or it is an extra, doesn't mean it's up for grabs. You want to take pictures. I have a 2k+ camera set up and a back up camera. Does that mean I have to hand over one or the other? No, it doesn't. \n\nYou come across as very entitled and bitter about their lack of involvement. Maybe they disagreed with your timing to buy. Maybe they have other things on their minds that you don't have knowledge of. Maybe they don't like you but you're excluding them because they didn't live up to your expectations.", "\u201cOhh so you didn\u2019t want to help, but now you want to come to our dinners..\u201d\n\nNTA", "YTA\n\nBe larger people and bury the hatchet and invite them to dinner. \n\nAlso, of course.yiu don't want gifts, you already got them!
