Now, my sister, Jessie, can\u2019t stand him still, especially since he started dating his new girlfriend and officially introduced her to their three children. They married at eighteen due to her getting pregnant and our parents and his insisting it\u2019s the best choice, seven years later they\u2019ve reached cracking point. \n\nAnyways, when I started sending out invitations to my engagement party, it felt wrong not to send him one, as he is family and has addressed to me before how much he doesn\u2019t wanna be excluded or left out from matters like these. My family agreed with me on that. We all knew my sister would overreact and be dramatic about it all, and at that point I was just gonna send him an invite, not sure if he\u2019ll come or not. But shortly after, Alex responds telling me he\u2019ll make it, then he asked me if it\u2019d be okay for him to bring a plus one. When I asked my fianc\u00e9 what he thought about this, he said he doesn\u2019t see a reason I should tell him no, as everyone has a plus one invitation and Jessie herself was gonna bring a date with her (this guy she\u2019s been casually talking to for the past three months) \n\nI come from a big southern family that knows no such thing as boundaries, they really wanted to meet Alex\u2019s girlfriend, especially my parents cause their grandkids are gonna be around her, so my mother took matters into her own hand and called him telling him he should bring a plus one. She put me in an uncomfortable position cause now I *really* didn\u2019t know what to tell Jessie. Alex coming sounded bad enough, bringing his girlfriend too? Yeah, that would make her turn into a dragon who has the ability of breathing fire that\u2019d burn me and everyone around us down. I told my mother she was in charge of breaking it to Jessie since she\u2019s the one who went ahead and told Alex he can bring his gf. Of course, not wanting to handle her wrath either, my mother brushed it off and didn\u2019t mention it to her.\n\nFast forward to the engagement party, when Jessie saw Alex and his girlfriend, she looked at me as if she wanted to murder me. Then she pulled me aside, took us to the bathroom, where she started yelling at me for twenty minutes straight, before crying and saying she couldn\u2019t believe I would do this to her. I calmed her down the best I could, apologized a numerous number of times, but said that he\u2019s the father of his children and family as it is, making him deserving of an invitation to an event like that.\n\nAfter that whole night my friends and Jessie\u2019s told me I was so wrong for not telling her about inviting Alex and his girlfriend, they thought it was a low asshole move, but I really can\u2019t see why as he is family but God knows my sister is still mad at me for it.

You have to ask if you are a YTA?   If you were my sister, I can\u2019t actually even finish that sentence.  I would be so hurt, disappointed and all around flabbergasted that you are so clueless  \n\nHead slap!!! - ohhhh wait we are all reading this the wrong way.   You are NOT that clueless, no one could be.  You actually hate your sister and are looking at ways to be mean and horrible to her, but hiding behind a wide eyed \u201coh what did I do wrong..?!!\u201d  You are so evil and smart!

Instead you put her in a situation she was totally emotionally unprepared for. You done f\u2019ed up.", "YTA. I'm all for maintaining civility across family lines despite a divorce when there are kids involved. But not giving your sister the decency of a head's up when, by your own admission, you *knew* she wouldn't want to be there if he was, is just shitty. If you feel that your actions are above reproach, you should not be ashamed to own up to them and tell your sister in advance what's going on.", "yta but softly because I see where you were coming from. someone should\u2019ve told your sister they were coming, this probably feels like betrayal to her", "As someone who married and divorced my brother\u2019s best friend, whom my whole family LOVED, you should have given her a heads up. YOU. Not your mom. You knew it was coming and were probably worried about it but didn\u2019t deal with it. And then it blew up in your face. Big surprise. /s\n\nBtw, we divorced 20 years ago and didn\u2019t have kids. I had to deal with my family still treating him like a son for years after the divorce. When he got remarried he sent everyone in my family an invite (except me). And none of them went. We were together for a family celebration that day. (Which is how I found out about the wedding. Someone commented that it looked like no one went to the wedding.) \n\nAt some point he\u2019ll be less important than your sister. Maybe start acting like it now. \n\nBtw, YTA.", "YTA.

Do you like your sisters ex husband more than your sister ?\n\nDoes your sister have custody over their shared\nkid/s.

She's the one who was married to him, she's the one who had a messy divorce, and *SHE* is your family. It doesn't matter that he wants to be included; unless we're talking family events that involve the kids, you need to discuss it with your sister. You most definitely should not have allowed him to bring his GF. Your mom needs to mind her own business too.\n\nEdit: you mentioned in another comment that you think the two of them miss each other and \"they just don't know how to communicate.\" Is your family pulling some sort of sick \"Parent Trap\" on them?!", "You could\u2019ve met his girlfriend privately at any other time instead of surprising your sister with an extremely uncomfortable situation. \n\n\u201cI come from a big southern family that knows no such thing as boundaries\u201d\n\nYeah, that\u2019s obvious. So you know you\u2019re crossing boundaries and you do it anyways.

Her ex is not your family, she is. And what you did it cruel, the invitation, allowing him to bring his new girlfriend and especially not telling her. You already knew it would upset her but because you've all gotten into the habit of making her the bad guy, you went ahead and knew you'd pretend like SHE was crazy. You keep poking at her then hiding your hands then acting like she's the supposed dragon. YTA.", "INFO: How long ago was the divorce? Was it amicable?", "YTA\n\nYou should've given your sister heads up, no doubt about that.

And not even a warning? \nYea no, I wouldn't forgive you for that betrayal.", "INFO: why does your family love the ex more than your sister?", "You suck.  Like for real.  You just showed your sister that you value her ex more than her.

Don\u2019t expect t your sister to have a good relationship with you again\u2014you\u2019re making it pretty obvious that you\u2019ll chose ex and new girlfriend over her, and so has your mom.

Hope she cuts you off. Toxic behaviour.", "YTA\n\nA year and a half is not that much time after a messy divorce.

Since ,ya know, you'd rather have him around then your sister", "Is she a dragon, or does she need to explode this way to get her needs heard?

You and your family ata.", "YTA\n\nYour whole family put the ex's wants to still be included over your sisters need to move on. The fact he has the front to turn up to HER family event with another woman is shocking disrespectful and you have all just damaged their co-parenting relationship. Plus your family put their curiosity with the new gf over your sisters feelings, nobody even asked them to leave to save your sister after she rightly took it badly. To make it worse, nobody bothered to tell her and then make out she is a drama queen for being rightfully upset. Also your mother is quite frankly a terrible mother, she should be so very ashamed but her actions. \n\nYou all suck. You all let her down. You are indeed the AH.", "YTA \nYou're a huge AH.

Sister needs to grow up.", "YTA, you keep trying to justify yourself but you ARE the asshole. Period.

I can't even describe to you how much you suck.\n\nSecond, he's not family. Your sister is family, and should be prioritized over her ex-husband and his girlfriend. Obviously. \n\nThird, you know it's a big deal, if it wasn't, you wouldn't be worried about telling your sister. stop trying to act innocent, Noone believes you and nobody cares.\n\nYou obviously don't care about your sister, if you did you would acknowledge that you messed up, but instead you're here, pretending you have no idea why she would be upset \"because he's family.\"\n\nDamn.

However she sounds borderline psychotic since everyone in your family is terrified of her wrath. \n\nOne more question: why did they break up specifically? Ie is her fury here warranted in some way because Alex cheated or Alex dumped her? The picture you are painting makes her seem emotionally unstable.", "YTA\n\nYour mom and you are cowards.

You should have given her the time to emotionally prepare.", "YTA. There was no f-king reason to not tell her in advance other than you being a chicken sh*t. After a messy divorce you do pick sides to a degree and if you truly loved your sister as you claim, you would have told her.", "YTA you and your mom are treating your sister like her feelings don\u2019t matter.

Also, what's wrong with just inviting him to the wedding? Or having a private dinner to meet his new gf? So many questions, but ultimately you don't care about her.

And then not giving your sister a warning or an option or choice was despicable. Utterly disrespectful. \n\nso what I am reading is you prefer the ex over the sister and yes when families divorce they keep their social engagements with ex's separate. Her ex seems to think tough on her I love this family don't care if it is hers I'm keeping it.

I think you are missing the point. You should have informed her before hand and the reason you didn\u2019t do it is because you were scared she might get you to change your plan of inviting her ex to the wedding or choose to skip it herself. You didn\u2019t want to deal with the consequences of your own actions so you ambushed her. \nThat being said I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the relative importance of your relationship with your sister and your relationship with your sisters ex - you are 100% prioritising one over the another and as an adult who has made a choice you should also be ready to face the consequences of it and not cry howl because you can\u2019t have your cake since you ate it.", "YTA. just bc there are kids involved actually does not mean you have to maintain a relationship w Alex. The only one who has to talk to him is your sister.  Doesn\u2019t mean you have to be rude or not wish him well when you see him but he isn\u2019t part of your family. Your sister should be leading whether her ex should be at family events or not and right now she isn\u2019t ready for that let alone him bringing a girlfriend with him.  Maybe in the future as their relationship settles in to the new norm and she feels comfortable, he can be there but that\u2019s up to her. \n\nThe fact you and your whole family blow off her feelings as being overly dramatic, being a pain you dread dealing with, and that she has no right to be upset shows just how little you think of her. And if she is dramatic, so what? You weren\u2019t in her marriage and I doubt you know everything that happened.

Now, my sister, Jessie, can\u2019t stand him still, especially since he started dating his new girlfriend and officially introduced her to their three children. They married at eighteen due to her getting pregnant and our parents and his insisting it\u2019s the best choice, seven years later they\u2019ve reached cracking point. \n\nAnyways, when I started sending out invitations to my engagement party, it felt wrong not to send him one, as he is family and has addressed to me before how much he doesn\u2019t wanna be excluded or left out from matters like these. My family agreed with me on that. We all knew my sister would overreact and be dramatic about it all, and at that point I was just gonna send him an invite, not sure if he\u2019ll come or not. But shortly after, Alex responds telling me he\u2019ll make it, then he asked me if it\u2019d be okay for him to bring a plus one. When I asked my fianc\u00e9 what he thought about this, he said he doesn\u2019t see a reason I should tell him no, as everyone has a plus one invitation and Jessie herself was gonna bring a date with her (this guy she\u2019s been casually talking to for the past three months) \n\nI come from a big southern family that knows no such thing as boundaries, they really wanted to meet Alex\u2019s girlfriend, especially my parents as their grandkids are gonna be around her, so my mother took matters into her own hand and called him telling him he should bring a plus one. She put me in an uncomfortable position cause now I *really* didn\u2019t know what to tell Jessie. Alex coming sounded bad enough, bringing his girlfriend too? Yeah, that would make her turn into a dragon who has the ability of breathing fire that\u2019d burn me and everyone around us down. I told my mother she was in charge of breaking it to Jessie since she\u2019s the one who went ahead and told Alex he can bring his gf. Of course, not wanting to handle her wrath either, my mother brushed it off and didn\u2019t mention it to her.\n\nFast forward to the engagement party, when Jessie saw Alex and his girlfriend, she looked at me as if she wanted to murder me. Then she pulled me aside, took up to the bathroom, where she started yelling at me for twenty minutes straight, before crying and saying she couldn\u2019t believe I would do this to her. I calmed her down the best I could, apologized a numerous number of times, but said that he\u2019s the father of his children and family as it is, making him deserving of an invitation to an event like that.\n\nAfter that whole night my friends and Jessie\u2019s told me I was so wrong for not telling her about inviting Alex and his girlfriend, they thought it was a low asshole move, but I really can\u2019t see why as he is family. Do you think AITA? God knows my sister is still mad at me for it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She should just avoid all of you.", "YTA, you deliberately didn't say anything to your sister, knowing full well it would upset her. Her ex-husband should never have been invited in the first place, he stopped being family the minute they got divorced.

You better get grovelling to your sister quick, before she makes that decision too.", "Would you like it if you were in her shoes? Definitely YTA. He brought a plus one. Ew.", "YTA and the rest of your family is as well, especially your mother. You knew inviting Alex and his gf would be an issue for your sister and you did it anyway. Basic decency says you should have at least told her about it beforehand but y\u2019all decided to ambush her. She now knows how much you care about her and value her feelings. If I were her, I would start distancing myself from my \u201csupportive\u201d family.", "YTA. all you had to do was tell your sister even if she would\u2019ve thrown a fit, at least you told her prior to the event", "YTA how about telling us the reasons you don't like your sister??

I cant imagine a more horrible family/friend betrayal.", "You and your mom are TA. You couldn\u2019t tell her beforehand cause you knew how\u2019d she react.

I can guarantee that there are things that he's done/said to her that would make you see him differently and vice versa. So for her walking in with zero warning ready to celebrate you and you fianc\u00e9 and your love for one another, instead she's blindsided by 7 years of ups and downs, resentment, anger, happiness, grief, insecurities, and God knows what else.

First of all, it\u2019s just smart business, so you minimize the potential for drama at your event. But it\u2019s also courteous because you give your guests the option of choosing whether or not to attend. I think you should be honest with yourself\u2026you know that telling her was the right thing to do\u2026but both you and your mom chose to be conflict avoidant.

Your sister deserves a better family.", "Most definitely TA. You've shown your sister you hold her ex's feelings & comfort far above hers. Especially since you ambushed her in front of family & friends. Seriously think about how you want to move forward because you might have permanently destroyed your relationship with her. She will most likely never trust you again.\n\nThe no boundaries thing is very toxic and I suspect this is the root of your treatment of your sister. She's expected to suck it up & deal while you treat her ex as if he's fragile. Gross", "YTA\u2026 you blindsided your sister and then you have the nerve to ask if your an AH?!

This was both cowardly and selfish.", "YTA dude what the hell", "YTA for not telling her so she could be prepared. Yes, he should still get to come to family functions (unless he was abusive) but you should still have given your sister a heads up. You put her in an awful situation with zero mental preparation.", "YTA. I love how you say your mom put you in an uncomfortable position by telling Alex to bring a plus one. You would not have been in this position if you had not invited Alex in the first place.", "YTA for not telling her. \n\nAlso out of interest, how old was Alex when he married your sister?", "ESH. Your mom should of told your sister if she wanted to go ahead and invite him. You also probably should of told her yourself.

Im assuming being pushed into a marriage where they are just incompatible?", "YTA. I guess you inherited being an AH from your mom.", "YTA for not talking to your sister.  She deserved a heads up at the very least.  Which is putting it mildly.\n\nHer reaction was over the top but how could you possibly think she *wouldn't* be upset being blindsided by her EX being there?  The fact that he is dating to be honest is irrelevant.  She is too, and it's been a year and a half.  However it adds another layer to the awkwardness and the emotions.\n\nPeople who divorce usually fall into one of three categories when dealing with their ex.  \n\n1) Absolutely hate them and can barely deal with them.  They want everyone to be on their side and wish for nothing but misery for the ex.\n\n2) Dislike or ambivalent to the ex but can remain civil and co parent.\n\n3) Can stay friends and on really good terms with their ex.  Can actually socialize and interact in good faith.\n\nYour sister may be in group 1 or possibly group 2.  She is most certainly not in group 3.

She would have been right to leave, but could have and should have addressed how upset she was after the fact.", "YTA. Some day, if you ever suffer through a nasty divorce, you will understand how awful it was to invite your sister's ex and his girlfriend to your engagement party without telling your sister. She deserved to know so she could decline your invitation, if she didn't want to be in her ex's presence. \n\nWhether anyone else thinks it's reasonable or not, your sister knows how she feels about her ex, and she knows she does not want to spend time with him and his girlfriend. She has the right to avoid them at social engagements. Your behavior was totally thoughtless.", "Honestly, I think your mom is the real AH. Pressuring a pregnant teen into marriage because it's best and then not even giving her a heads up about the ex and gf being there after what was an inevitable divorce (teens should not get married) just screams that appearances matter more to her than her daughter's well-being. \n\nI don't doubt that your mom loves Jessie too but she has not been a good or caring mom in either situation you mention to Jessie. Your sister deserves an apology for being blindsided and for being pressured into an unhealthy marriage at 18 simply because she became pregnant.", "YTA you created a tense and difficult situation and then sat back to watch it unfold. Everything that happened was totally predictable.  Your sister shouldn't have to deal with her ex and his new gf at a family party when they aren't on good terms.

We weren\u2019t as close as sisters, I was actually closer to her brother, and she was closer to my sister despite her being the same age as me. My BIL cheated on her and got his side piece pregnant. My still being her friend caused problems in my marriage as my husband saw it as me being disrespectful to his brother, despite it being his brother who had cheated. My husband was sent away by his work, and so couldn\u2019t attend my birthday party, but I still went ahead and had one. I invited my BIL and his heavily pregnant girlfriend - and invite my friend and her new boyfriend.

Your mother showed her priorities and your sister didn't feature. And you did the exact same thing. \n\nSadly this isn't a small situation; your sister will have felt totally blindsided by you all. That impacts her ability to trust you. If you can't see the significance of this- that at your engagement party, her ex and his gf were prioritised over her - then you are not likely to come back from this.

No wonder she's reactive! You people are thoughtless, ADMIT you have no boundaries, and instead of trying to address YOUR bad behavior pass your sister off as being the issue. Your family pressured a pregnant teenager into marrying her teenage boyfriend, I guarantdamntee you all pressured her to \"make it work\" during a struggling marriage, and then united AGAINST HER with her ex husband. Your behavior is appalling, and I wouldn't blame her for dumping the lot of you.", "The fact that you see this as a small situation is part of your problem. You don't get to decide how your sister feels about her relationship with her ex. So what if her divorce was over a year ago. There are people who get divorced that hate each other for the rest of their lives. \n\nI would think that all these people telling you that YTA would open your eyes to how wrong you and your mother were. Instead, you are digging in your heels and continue to try and justify your position which truly is indefensible.\n\nYou should be ashamed of yourself.

I guess because I don\u2019t expect people to hate each other after a divorce unless there are specific reasons.\n\nI don\u2019t wish any ill on you; I don\u2019t know you. I just think your communication skills are horrible. Also, you claim to love your sister dearly but characterize her as a drama queen and then drop this bombshell on her.\n\nI\u2019m going to say that everybody sucks.

They both have no reason to be upset that the other is dating dating.  \n\nESH.", "No, but thanks for playing.", "No, neither of them cheated", "They were both 18 op mentioned it in another comment.

You\u2019ve shown how little regard you have for her feelings and what she\u2019s been though. And you\u2019re incredibly selfish. You admit you know she wouldn\u2019t have come if she was aware he was invited, so you deliberately lied and put her into an very uncomfortable situation so you could have your way. I hope it was all worth it. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any coming back from this. I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to have anything to do with you for a very long time.", "Ok. It just floors me how cruel this is. Even if they are both at fault, why would you do this to her knowing how she feels?  The fact that she was pushed into marriage, she probably did not want, and then after everything burns down around her, you guys pick him.  From the outside, her feelings don't seem to ever be considered by your family.\n\nNow, she is getting a clear message from your family that his feelings will always be more important than hers.   Of course, that is going to hurt. \n\nYou have no reason to invite him to family events.  His not attending your family events has zero effect on his relationship with his kids.  That is for them to sort out. \n\nAlso. I am not buying his innocence in this.  He knew what he was doing, bringing a GF.  He wanted to rub it in her face.  Then he got mad because she had a plus one and was a moody ass the whole event. He meant to cause her pain, and you gave him the platform.\n\nIf you live someone, you respect their boundaries.", "Yeah he was in the exact same position she was"]}
