Tom and I dated for a couple of years and my parents absolutely loved him, invited him to everything and constantly talked about him like we were already married. Then he found out he had a kid from a one night stand from just before we started dating.  I tried to roll with it for a few more months after that, but it was just too much to deal with too soon in the relationship for me and I broke it off.  I think it was for the best, though Tom desperately tried to get me to stay and enlisted my parents to talk me out of leaving.  I told them to drop it or I was going to go NC for awhile because I already had a lot to deal with, so they did. This was 6 months ago and I have Tom blocked on everything, all the mutual friends know the score and are good at keeping things separate, and I\u2019m dating again.\n\nSo, I show up to Thanksgiving with my parents like usual and guess who\u2019s sitting in the living room? Tom and Kid (M, 3 now I think).  He gets up all happy to see me and I turn around and walk back out, get in the car, and go to my hotel.  My mom calls and asks me where I went and why I left and I told her she knows damn well why and ask why Tom was there.  She told me that they still consider him part of the family and they love his son and didn\u2019t want them to be alone for the holiday.  When I asked why she didn\u2019t tell me ahead of time, she kind of stalled and then admitted that she knows I don\u2019t want to see him but that I obviously still love him and they thought if I could just see how great everything could be he and I could reconcile.\n\nThat kind of infuriated me, not going to lie. I don\u2019t want to be a step-parent or at least not right now and not in this particular situation. It sucks, but I\u2019ve processed it and moved on.  I told my mom that what they did was wrong and really out of line and that I was going home, hope their Thanksgiving with Tom was all they hoped it would be.  Then I turned off my phone for the rest of day.  When I finally turned it back on, I had a slew of texts and VMs, some from Tom using my parents\u2019 phones. I deleted them without listening to the whole message and finally called my mom back last week after I had calmed down.\n\nShe apologized for springing Tom on me and I told her that she needs to stop hoping we\u2019ll get back together and that I don\u2019t want Tom in my life. She admitted that they wanted to invite him for Christmas as well, evidently he now has sole custody of the kid and my parents have been playing grandparent. I told her that any function Tom is at I won\u2019t be at and if they ever spring him on me again that will be the last time we speak for a very long time.\n\nMy parents are accusing me of being cruel by making them choose and giving an ultimatum, with a side dish of \u201cthat little boy needs a family\u201d guilt.

If they had invited Tom and his kid and gave you a heads up that they didn't want him to be alone for the holidays, I think you would have been put off, but could have dealt with it. I don't get why they would let Tom call you from their phones. Their intentions here are way too entangled and that your mom stalled when you asked why Tom was there indicate they had other motives.

This and the fact they are love bombing his child is enough to have been fooled into making a big mistake. Hopefully, he will realise you are not interested and will start dating someone else and start to spend time with his gf family and pull back from yours.

Trying to force a relationship, particularly when you have made your intent clear is abusive.  They are trying to make you be the mom of the kid when that's not what you want.

This is not petty at all, it is a huge violation of you as a person and as a daughter. Furthermore, Tom was NEVER part of \"the family\".  Your mom is more interested in Tom's well being than yours.

Your parwnts sbouldnt be springing an ex on you and hoping you get back together.  You seem to hold a grudge against tom for something that happened before you where together and that he was unaware of. Sounds like he is stepping up and doing the right thing.

Why even spend two years with a person you obviously didn't see a future with?", "I am not sure if YTA, but you are definitely not a monster, it's just that... you never actually loved that man, which makes your parents being objectively more mean to Tom than to you. Individuals follow different reproductive strategies and yours is not about a romanticized image of self-less love. Rather, you know what you want from a relationship and you want to see investment in your own genes, not your partner's energy and resources leaking into side-projects.\n\nIt's a pity if you had any ambitions of becoming \"mother Teresa\", but otherwise natural. Only if you take that as an excuse to cut out your parents for the rest of their lives, you would be severely overdoing the strategy you follow in life. But you generally seem to be overdoing this strategy, that's the only AH part about it. Like cutting Tom out of your life that radically, like ok... he is not going to be the husband of your kids, but... surely you shared one or other interest or value, something that generally connects people into a type of community... or do you have any friends at all? I don't think it is a particular action that made you the A of the story, but you are the A for overdoing it.

Not much though.", "That whole situation was just bad, I don\u2019t know the full details but Tom was contacted because the birth mom was in a mess of trouble and probably going to lose custody anyway.

This is definitely going to be true this Christmas. However, when Tom finally meets someone new who is willing to be a stepparent, he will move on and spend holidays with his actual family.

His ah-ness is pretty easily chalked up to false hope, probably fed to him by op's parents.", "Right? And then had the nerve to leave voicemail using her parents\u2019 phone? Dude is super manipulative. Reminds me of Kilgrave in Jessica Jones.", "Not really when he has used her parents before in this way. its completely wrong of him to keep ambushing her like this. OP set boundaries he needs to respect them and not use her parents to make her get back with him", "Like he clearly knows shes blocked him. Like take the hint. Also how is it her parents are really fine with this. Their daughter clearly told them that she was done with him, but clearly ignoring him is he rich or something? Where are his parents in all of this?", "I'm not saying he's innocent. And I did say he needs to respect her boundaries. I'm just also saying people in love are occasionally stupid and get tunnel vision. Her parents don't even have that excuse.", "Yeah, whole thing is wild. When a relationship went south, never did I think that I should enlist ex\u2019s parents on my side and force the person back into an unwanted relationship. It sounds like her parents don\u2019t have her interests in mind at all. Tom doesn\u2019t sound like a healthy guy. \n\nYou bring up a good point. Where is Tom\u2019s parents?
