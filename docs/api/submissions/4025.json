Tom and I dated for a couple of years and my parents absolutely loved him, invited him to everything and constantly talked about him like we were already married. Then he found out he had a kid from a one night stand from just before we started dating.  I tried to roll with it for a few more months after that, but it was just too much to deal with too soon in the relationship for me and I broke it off.  I think it was for the best, though Tom desperately tried to get me to stay and enlisted my parents to talk me out of leaving.  I told them to drop it or I was going to go NC for awhile because I already had a lot to deal with, so they did. This was 6 months ago and I have Tom blocked on everything, all the mutual friends know the score and are good at keeping things separate, and I\u2019m dating again.\n\nSo, I show up to Thanksgiving with my parents like usual and guess who\u2019s sitting in the living room? Tom and Kid (M, 3 now I think).  He gets up all happy to see me and I turn around and walk back out, get in the car, and go to my hotel.  My mom calls and asks me where I went and why I left and I told her she knows damn well why and ask why Tom was there.  She told me that they still consider him part of the family and they love his son and didn\u2019t want them to be alone for the holiday.  When I asked why she didn\u2019t tell me ahead of time, she kind of stalled and then admitted that she knows I don\u2019t want to see him but that I obviously still love him and they thought if I could just see how great everything could be he and I could reconcile.\n\nThat kind of infuriated me, not going to lie. I don\u2019t want to be a step-parent or at least not right now and not in this particular situation. It sucks, but I\u2019ve processed it and moved on.  I told my mom that what they did was wrong and really out of line and that I was going home, hope their Thanksgiving with Tom was all they hoped it would be.  Then I turned off my phone for the rest of day.  When I finally turned it back on, I had a slew of texts and VMs, some from Tom using my parents\u2019 phones. I deleted them without listening to the whole message and finally called my mom back last week after I had calmed down.\n\nShe apologized for springing Tom on me and I told her that she needs to stop hoping we\u2019ll get back together and that I don\u2019t want Tom in my life. She admitted that they wanted to invite him for Christmas as well, evidently he now has sole custody of the kid and my parents have been playing grandparent. I told her that any function Tom is at I won\u2019t be at and if they ever spring him on me again that will be the last time we speak for a very long time.\n\nMy parents are accusing me of being cruel by making them choose and giving an ultimatum, with a side dish of \u201cthat little boy needs a family\u201d guilt.

There\u2019s a lot of changing that happens with my age group statistically and of the friends I know who got married young, most of them are struggling and a lot of them are headed for divorce.

That you want nothing to do with anyone who violates this, as it will end any and all relationships.

This isn't a hallmark movie, it's so messed up of all the adults to pull this drama. \nNext time your mom starts in with the being cruel drama,  reverse uno it and start asking how she can be so cruel to bring him into your life when you've made it perfectly clear you do not want to be in the same room with him. How she's the one making ultimatums by forcing him on you, against your will.", "NTA You arent making them choose they already chose. You said youre not dating this guy and they said \"but he has a kid\" they decided what they want and maybe what  tom wants are both more important than you. You simply reminded them that you are a complete human on your own and they dont get to make your life decisions", "NTA They went crazy", "Nta.  Get a lawyer and send a formal letter that all communication must be done through the lawyer.  They don\u2019t respect your boundaries and neither does your ex.  Make proactive choices to protect yourself", "NTA and absolutely do not put up with this. My parents tried the same crap with a guy they adored and I made very clear was not interested in. Set very clear boundaries and yes - if they pull this shit, leaving is exactly whst you should do.\n\nThey think they can force a relationship with you and stupidly think you will fall in love with this kid and Tom if they shove you together.", "You didn't give them an ultimatum. You never told them to cut him out of their lives (which would be an ultimatum), you only told them you expected your wishes respected to not have him forced into *your* life by them injecting him into family events. You are your parents' family already, and they are the ones putting you and your parents' existing relationship at risk.\n\nYour demand was a very reasonable and rational expectation. It's a boundary.\n\nNTA. Let the chips fall where they may if they are willing to lose you to bring in this new surrogate family. And follow through on your consequences if they cross your boundary again.", "NTA. And you know what\u2019s just about the cruelest thing you can do to a child? Falsely tell a kid with no mom that they\u2019re getting a stepmother when it\u2019s not true.", ">see what a bunch of strangers on the internet think about what you did with only a few paragraphs of context!?", "OP might not ever want children, and that is okay too. I think going NC is enough. If they are willing to lose their own child over this, it speaks for itself.", "Let's not do this bullshit. The people who love you are family, and if they love that kid, who gives a shit about biology?\n\nThat does *not* give them the right to foist Tom and his son on OP against her states wishes, for the record.", "Agree with that. Forget the ultimatums. That\u2019s only gonna serve to make the parents resent OP. She just needs to put them on a time out so they can see what their life will be like without their daughter. Is losing their daughter worth gaining a pseudo son", "That's a big ass leap to go from Tom sneaking into a family event to try to reconnect with OP who has expressedly cut all ties with him, to Tom needs to avoid OP in every possible scenario at all costs.\n\nThat isn't what happened and you know it."]}
