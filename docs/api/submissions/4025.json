Tom and I dated for a couple of years and my parents absolutely loved him, invited him to everything and constantly talked about him like we were already married. Then he found out he had a kid from a one night stand from just before we started dating.  I tried to roll with it for a few more months after that, but it was just too much to deal with too soon in the relationship for me and I broke it off.  I think it was for the best, though Tom desperately tried to get me to stay and enlisted my parents to talk me out of leaving.  I told them to drop it or I was going to go NC for awhile because I already had a lot to deal with, so they did. This was 6 months ago and I have Tom blocked on everything, all the mutual friends know the score and are good at keeping things separate, and I\u2019m dating again.\n\nSo, I show up to Thanksgiving with my parents like usual and guess who\u2019s sitting in the living room? Tom and Kid (M, 3 now I think).  He gets up all happy to see me and I turn around and walk back out, get in the car, and go to my hotel.  My mom calls and asks me where I went and why I left and I told her she knows damn well why and ask why Tom was there.  She told me that they still consider him part of the family and they love his son and didn\u2019t want them to be alone for the holiday.  When I asked why she didn\u2019t tell me ahead of time, she kind of stalled and then admitted that she knows I don\u2019t want to see him but that I obviously still love him and they thought if I could just see how great everything could be he and I could reconcile.\n\nThat kind of infuriated me, not going to lie. I don\u2019t want to be a step-parent or at least not right now and not in this particular situation. It sucks, but I\u2019ve processed it and moved on.  I told my mom that what they did was wrong and really out of line and that I was going home, hope their Thanksgiving with Tom was all they hoped it would be.  Then I turned off my phone for the rest of day.  When I finally turned it back on, I had a slew of texts and VMs, some from Tom using my parents\u2019 phones. I deleted them without listening to the whole message and finally called my mom back last week after I had calmed down.\n\nShe apologized for springing Tom on me and I told her that she needs to stop hoping we\u2019ll get back together and that I don\u2019t want Tom in my life. She admitted that they wanted to invite him for Christmas as well, evidently he now has sole custody of the kid and my parents have been playing grandparent. I told her that any function Tom is at I won\u2019t be at and if they ever spring him on me again that will be the last time we speak for a very long time.\n\nMy parents are accusing me of being cruel by making them choose and giving an ultimatum, with a side dish of \u201cthat little boy needs a family\u201d guilt.

Christmas is an important kid holiday sounds fair. They can give your gifts early on Thanksgiving", "OP needs to tell them that with this behavior, tom's kid will be the only grandchild they will see because they wont see any of her children like this.\n\nNTA", "How about the ex's parents? The son's mother? The bio mom's parents?\n\nI there's some questions that I want the answer.", "NTA for not treating this kid as an Inta-grandkid-in-a-cup.", "His family has always been pretty unstable and he avoids them, which is one reason he probably took to my parents.  If you imagined any random WASPy couple from a country club you\u2019d have something pretty close to my family.  From what I understand, kid\u2019s birth mom was going to lose custody and none of her family wanted anything to do with either of them when CPS was trying to find family to take him, so it\u2019s just a really screwed up situation all around. I can understand why Tom didn\u2019t want to lose out on my family for both him and his kid.  If my parents weren\u2019t trying to get us back together or insisting I be involved with them, I totally wouldn\u2019t mind them being there for Tom and son in some capacity.  I\u2019m just not going to be.", "It was a few months. Not a couple years.", "Not everyone is a fast burn on relationships and I don\u2019t feel like 2 years in my mid 20: and not having even lived together is long enough to make a permanent commitment to someone or parent with them, especially while I\u2019m finishing up grad school and my life path isn\u2019t firmly set up.  There\u2019s a lot of changing that happens with my age group statistically and of the friends I know who got married young, most of them are struggling and a lot of them are headed for divorce. I wouldn\u2019t even think about marrying someone that I hadn\u2019t lived with for at least a year first to make sure they can hold up their end of a shared household. So, maybe we would have gotten there with more time, but I\u2019m not going to rush into something before I know it has bones to last beyond emotion.  Which was smart, really, if I had invested more in the relationship on a faster timeline and then a dealbreaker like this came up, it would have been a lot harder to untangle.", "Why give false hope to someone when you are no longer able to be part of that relationship. This kid is going through alot and OP might not be able to handle this herself. Also given how he showed up with the kid as some type of emotional blackmail he clearly wants her to be a mom to the kid. OP did not have this kid, and she is doing the responsible thing here and stepping away from the situation. Tom though is obsessed in getting her back when his attention needs to be on the kid. Not everyone is able to be a parent or wants to be a parent. Tom needs to realize that he has a child and that child comes first. Forcing OP to take him back also means that she has to be a parent to the child. before you say thats not true it is. Kid is 3 if she says no to anything she will be made to be the bad one. OP knows her limits Tom does not.", "It was a few months in, not a couple years. READ the post.", "Nope. Her relationship ended and her parents do not respect her.", "She doesn't want to be around him. He knows and force himself onto her. He is a big AH.", ">These parents sticking with the ex posts really get me. \n\nMy family all chose my cousin's ex over him. He's a deadbeat addict who abused his ex while she was pregnant then he landed in prison. His sentence keeps getting extended for doing/dealing drugs in there and getting into fights.\n\nHis ex, their daughter, ex's new husband, and ex's step kids, are all lovely people. They all get invited to the holidays (ex's family disowned her for the teenaged pregnancy, so we're who she's got). \n\nNo regrets on which side we picked.", "OP is NTA - talk about lack of boundaries!  The parents just don't get it.   I'm sure Tom and kid will be a Xmas and probably a bunch of holidays and birthdays.  OP go NC now for a least a couple of years.   They can spend them all with Tom and kid.", "Right? And you know that kid is going to have been told she's his new mom or something equally unhinged. There's a LOT of therapy in that child's future.", "There is a movie on Netflix by one of my favorite comedians where she ends up buying a billboard and outs what he did to her, the movie ends with her flipping the billboard off lol. Does that work? It\u2019s a good movie!", "> Tom and I dated for a couple of years and my parents absolutely loved him.", "Honestly, I think you sort of dodged a bullet here.  Not just with the child situation (which wasn\u2019t foreseen and is a lot for both you and him to deal with), but more so because Tom has not respected boundaries.  I get that he himself is dealing with a very difficult situation but there is a lot of pressure and deception going on since you broke up - intense pressure to get back together, enlisting your parents to help him (to the extent that you had to threaten NC), the planning of Thanksgiving and Christmas without giving you a heads up, and your parents playing grandparents.  It\u2019s ironic that how he/they handled the breakup seems to be providing numerous reasons not to get back together.", "You totally doing the right thing for yourself!  Congrats AITA\\_6395837", "The post says OP dated the guy for a couple years and after they learned about the kid stayed a few more months before ending it.", "Sure, so what... parents are not allowed to be in the wrong? Do you know what parents are, buddy?  \n\n\nParents have to literally hold your head in a special way for the first three months of your life, just so you don't break your neck. They also literally had to wipe your ass when you were 2 years old, but cut them off forever if they take one wrong turn, because... \"I need to prove to the world what an independent person I am, life is all about self-representation, I cannot allow family to get in the way of that...\"", "Calling them \"people completely unconnected to them\" just shows your bias against the idea of chosen or found family. They have obviously established a relationship, and blood is not the only valid way to be connected to someone. \n\nJust as children have no obligation to \"provide\" grandchildren, so do parents have the right to seek out opportunities to act as grandparents given the opportunity.", "I mean Tom trying to keep her in his life when after a few rocky months isn't stepping over her boundries...thats him advocating for himself. When she had enough he stopped..but...it does sound like he went too far with it.  I will admit I didn't recall that sentence when I responded..so it does imply he was a bit to forceful and actively recruiting her parents to help in his quest for her back.", "I expect that will bite them in the arse if OP has children down the track and suddenly they don\u2019t have access to their actual grandchild.", "My ex and i are pretty good friends, my family loves her and i love her, but we only got here because we didn't talk for years.\n\nOnce we did we were able to talk about things and apologize. She had cheated on me and i was reacting by being fairly abusive. We had to work through all of that. Then we realized we were only ever supposed to be friends. I met her fiancee, and loved her. And she met my boyfriend, and loved him.\n\nI agree that after a significant relationship, the only way to become friends is time.", "I might have missed some subsequent comments, but yeah, I get it was OP's & not Tom's parents & they sprung him on her. She doesn't want to be with him or be a stepparent. Cool. I just don't see how that translates into them never being in the same room together, ever, with dire consequences to any who arrange it thus. All she has to do is give him the cold shoulder. She's an adult, right?", "I read all of that. So that means Tom has to arrange his social life to ensure not encountering OP? Maybe it's telling that OP's parents like him more than OP & would rather have him in their lives. Maybe OP would be everyone a favor going NC.", "Yeah I already addressed it lol \ud83d\ude06", "Yeah. My bad. I went back and re- read it\n However, dating for 2 yrs in one situation is still developing relationship. It's still new. Maybe I am a weirdo, but saying and feeling I love you takes time. Having a surprise kid foisted on a new relationship can also put the kibosh on that burgeoning love. OP is not a jerk for noping out of that responsibility.  That doesn't make her heartless either. Just smart and actually compassionate because she saw the impact of resentment over this kid and chose to protect herself and them by ending it.", "They are insisting in their mistake, so.", "He didn't stop though he continued. he kept calling her and when he realized he was blocked kept calling her again from her parents phone. Six months is too early espcially after all of this just to be friends. Tom clearly has feelings for her still hes not stopping by giving her space.", "Getting her parents to help force himself into her life despite her making it clear it's over is absolutely AH behaviour", ">but it all sounded too wordy.\n\nSometimes more words brings more clarity. Just saying ;P\n\nNTA OP.", "Especially because when look at it sensibly, even the most patient and angelic of women would feel uncomfortable about spending holidays with the parents of their new partners ex-girlfriend, especially when said ex-girlfriend isn't even the mother of the child involved.\n\nOP's parents' days with surrogate grandchild are numbered, they just haven't realised it yet.", "And when the new woman in his life hears even a twisted version of this story, odds are good she\u2019s going to feel weird about her partner being so close with his ex\u2019s parents, too. So I would anticipate even lower contact then.", "Again they just broke up they are not close to being friends. Tom keeps pushing her boundaries by trying ot get back together even though she has been clear. Her parents did this to try and get them back together. Until Tom understands there is no future and he has to move on they can't be there together. her parents choosing her ex bf over her and her comfort is kinda wack. When someone stalks you its uncomfortable to say the least. Tom should remove himself instead of staying. He said he felt bad but he never left or asked OP if its alright for him to be there. This isnt a party with friends they have in common, but her family he is clearly overstepping her boundaries.", "He never asked OP. OP is his ex who has been clear that she does not want to get back together with him and its only been six months. This OPs parents house not his parents place. It is really weird for him to be there just because her parents invited him. its called common courtesy. \n\nAlso read the post again since you clearly are either a troll or can't understand that she has boundaries and he keeps crossing them.", "There's ways to break their will rather than the contact. I would make my parents so ashamed of/during the meeting, they would never dream of arranging that again.", ">I'm just also saying people in love are occasionally stupid and get tunnel vision.\n\nThat's not really and acceptable excuse. He harassed OP after the breakup to the point that she had to threaten to block her own parents. He earned the title of asshole the moment he involved her parents.", "Fair. I just still, personally, think the parents are worse."]}
