Tom and I dated for a couple of years and my parents absolutely loved him, invited him to everything and constantly talked about him like we were already married. Then he found out he had a kid from a one night stand from just before we started dating.  I tried to roll with it for a few more months after that, but it was just too much to deal with too soon in the relationship for me and I broke it off.  I think it was for the best, though Tom desperately tried to get me to stay and enlisted my parents to talk me out of leaving.  I told them to drop it or I was going to go NC for awhile because I already had a lot to deal with, so they did. This was 6 months ago and I have Tom blocked on everything, all the mutual friends know the score and are good at keeping things separate, and I\u2019m dating again.\n\nSo, I show up to Thanksgiving with my parents like usual and guess who\u2019s sitting in the living room? Tom and Kid (M, 3 now I think).  He gets up all happy to see me and I turn around and walk back out, get in the car, and go to my hotel.  My mom calls and asks me where I went and why I left and I told her she knows damn well why and ask why Tom was there.  She told me that they still consider him part of the family and they love his son and didn\u2019t want them to be alone for the holiday.  When I asked why she didn\u2019t tell me ahead of time, she kind of stalled and then admitted that she knows I don\u2019t want to see him but that I obviously still love him and they thought if I could just see how great everything could be he and I could reconcile.\n\nThat kind of infuriated me, not going to lie. I don\u2019t want to be a step-parent or at least not right now and not in this particular situation. It sucks, but I\u2019ve processed it and moved on.  I told my mom that what they did was wrong and really out of line and that I was going home, hope their Thanksgiving with Tom was all they hoped it would be.  Then I turned off my phone for the rest of day.  When I finally turned it back on, I had a slew of texts and VMs, some from Tom using my parents\u2019 phones. I deleted them without listening to the whole message and finally called my mom back last week after I had calmed down.\n\nShe apologized for springing Tom on me and I told her that she needs to stop hoping we\u2019ll get back together and that I don\u2019t want Tom in my life. She admitted that they wanted to invite him for Christmas as well, evidently he now has sole custody of the kid and my parents have been playing grandparent. I told her that any function Tom is at I won\u2019t be at and if they ever spring him on me again that will be the last time we speak for a very long time.\n\nMy parents are accusing me of being cruel by making them choose and giving an ultimatum, with a side dish of \u201cthat little boy needs a family\u201d guilt. I don\u2019t care if they want to surrogate grandparent or be friends with Tom, but I won\u2019t be involved and I\u2019m hearing from a lot of people that I\u2019m being a petty AH.", "created_utc": 1670258243, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zdbsvt/aita_for_refusing_to_visit_my_parents_after_they/", "score": 167, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your parents are choosing an ex over you at every turn. I hope that your chosen family is better than them. I would recommend making a backup plan for Christmas with your close friends.", "NTA your parents need to stop inviting Tom to everything.

Becoming a stepparent is a huge undertaking, and not one that should be taken if you have any doubts. The only thing your parents are right about is that the child should have a family.

They ALL thought blowing up your phone when you were feeling upset was the way to go?\n\nYour boundaries are reasonable. You've not asked them not to have a relationship with him, but you've been clear about what YOU need in order to protect your own moving on journey. You communicated your boundaries beforehand.

They are upset because you're making then CHOOSE??  Choose between you, their daughter, and a boyfriend you had 6 months ago???  Is there really a choice here?  Your parents are being total AHs.
