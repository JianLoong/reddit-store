So we assumed he had no special care needs. We very quickly found out that the kibble she gave us played havoc on his stomach, and we had to take him to the vet after 2 days because he just would not stop throwing up and was understandably in a lot of distress. The vet ran some tests and found out that he was intolerant to one of the ingredients in the kibble and gave us suggestions for food, which we of course bought. We let Jen know and she seemed concerned but we didn\u2019t hear from her untill they day before she was supposed to pick him up, she asked if we would mind caring for him for another 4 days as there had been a few delays on her end. We were slightly put out because we were supposed to be going on a trip that weekend but we didn\u2019t want to leave him alone and didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be able to find a cattery on such short notice so we cancelled our trip and agreed. Jen said she\u2019d pick him up at the end of the 4 days. \n\nThat was 7 months ago. We heard nothing from Jen in the meantime despite many repeated attempts to text and call her. She ignored us and our updates about him, complete radio silence and ghosting for 7 months. We were really worried about her initially because before this Gravy was the light of her life, untill she started posting pics of her partying with her bf on insta every weekend. She didn\u2019t ask about Gravy once. Meanwhile, he\u2019s become a treasured part of our family. He gets treated like a king, we completely redecorated to make room to have cool little cat runways on the wall which he loves, he gets his pick of furniture, has several comfy beds in each of our rooms and we even renamed him to Gravy (his name was Jack before, he didn\u2019t respond to it). He has one of every cat toy at the pet store, he enjoys catnip tea on Sundays and loves to cuddle and watch animal planet. We\u2019re a dual income household with no kids, I\u2019m pretty sure he is the most spoiled cat in state. \n\nOn Friday Jen turned up unannounced and asked for him back so she could take him to live with her in NY, where she is planning on moving now. We of course said no, she hasn\u2019t bothered to check on him once in the last 7 months, and she gave us kibble she didn\u2019t even know he was allergic to. He\u2019s well taken care of and loved, and we don\u2019t trust her to take care of him anymore. We have been disagreeing with her about it ever since untill she threatened to call the cops.

I hope he ends up with you. \n\nJen is very much TA.", "Most places treat animals as property. BUT since she left him with you and went no contact, you may be able to prove a case of abandonment.  I would have the texts and vet records printed out to prove that  she abandoned the cat.", "NTA that is your cat until she reimburses you for 7 months of expenses and vet visits.", "NTA- Morally, Jen gave up her rights to her cat when she abandoned him. If microchipped, you might have turned him into a shelter for abandonment, letting them know if she refused to pick him up, you were adopting him. That might have been a way legally, but I do not blame you one bit. Get the vet bills together and tell her you will take her to small claims court. The police will not make you hand over the cat. They don\u2019t walk around with microchip readers. They will consider that a civil matter. Tell her it will go to court. I doubt she fights that hard for a cat she abandoned.", "NTA  \nYou provided both a good home and genuine care for the cat, which can't be said for the original owner. Moreover, you honestly tried getting in contact with her, but she didn't respond.  \n\n\nI'm not from the states, however, so I can't tell you how this would play out in the courts.", "NTA you have go above and beyond in looking after gravy. It will be a shame for you to lose him but I would definitely check local laws. Where I live if a cat is microchipped it belongs to the person even if I find it, look after it for years etc and has to be returned as cats are classed as property so this falls under theft. I would also try to speak with her calmly or text explaining all you've done regarding the cats health etc and how you have bonded with gravy. How old is the cat?", "NTA--- The cops can't do anything about it, its a civil thing. She can take you to claims court BUT she has to be able to provide records that its her cat....BUT YOU also have records because of the Vet bills, so technically it would be a stale mate in court and you will keep the cat anyway. I say just let her fade away into obscurity, she aint got nothin.", "NTA. Like someone else said, if she wants it that bad then you need to charge her for the vet bills, all food you have bought over the last 7 months, and a boarding fee for every day you had the cat. Guarantee she doesn't want to pay thousands of dollars to get the cat back when she can just buy a new cat for $100 when she gets to New York.", "NTA.\n\nShe doesn't care about the cat. \n\nI'd check your local laws and document everything. Tell her that you've become very attached, and offer to set her up with a new kitty or whatever Gravy reasonably originally cost.", "NTA but you may not have sound legal standing to keep the cat.\n\nShe obviously wasn't being a good owner to Gravy and not providing a healthy quality of life. Between the food issues and the length of abandonment without communication she's a crap cat owner and doesn't deserve her cat back. She should at bare minimum be reimbursing you for costs.\n\nThat being said the law treats pets like property, not like children. Quality of care isn't typically something that's going to be considered. It's not a custody issue, it's possession of property. As a cat mom myself I find that horrible and wish our laws would catch up but it's reality right now. So understand that if she presses it legally with you there's a good chance you'll lose, especially if she has previous ownership records.\n\nTrying to have a conversation is the best avenue you have. Say you won't charge her for vet fees and supplies if she gives up Gravy's ownership and that you'll take her to court if she takes the cat back and doesn't reimburse you. You want that in writing in case she changes her mind. If she doesn't want to give up Gravy you should prepare for a potential legal fight. That may still result in her having to pay you back depending on the judge and evidence but may not result in you keeping the cat. It sucks.\n\nThank you for caring so much about Gravy and being a good cat owner!", "NTA. You rescued that cat from an abusive and neglectful home and gave it the love, care, and attention it needs and deserves.\n\nAs for stealing? No. You can't steal a cat, a cat isn't a piece of property, a cat is a living being. A living being you rescued from a neglectful caretaker.", "Possession truly is 9/10s of the law. Block this girl on everything and make her take Gravy back, we'll see if she actually wants him enough to go to the trouble. It sounds like you have the cash, so if you are worried, a quick consultation with an attorney will probably set you at ease. I am not an attorney, but I do work for one, and I expect an attorney will tell you that there is no time or cost effective legal mechanism for Jen to use to get Gravy back. I've seen people abscond with human children in defiance of court orders, and it is A MESS to return the children to their rightful parent, even when the law unequivocally calls for their return. I expect Gravy has found his forever home :)\n\nAnd NTA, grinds my gears when people treat pets like inanimate possessions and take advantage of the kindness of others.", "Look her dead in the eye and say, \"We don't have Jack, our cats name is Gravy...\"\n\nnta....BTW, Gravy.. fantastic name...", "NTA. My veterinarian put it this way, \"you pay his bills, he's your cat\". She saw the cat as disposable, if she wants one, she can go to a shelter; if any would let her have an animal.", "ESH. \n\nSure, she abandonned it with you. But it's still her cat. \n\nThe only thing you can do here is ask for a reimbursment of the cat food & vet bills.", "ESH, she shouldn\u2019t have ditched her cat but it is still her cat- you can\u2019t just keep it.\nIf you care that much get a lawyer, as a minimum you can probably claim all of the expenses of keeping her car for 7 months and negotiate with her", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Small claims.\n\nHere's what she's got working against her:\n\n* Legally, pets are property. We all understand how much our pets can be like family, but legally they are property and if she sued you, in all likelihood the most she could *try* to claim is the value of the cat.\n\n* You've incurred a bunch of expenses taking care of her cat that you wouldn't have incurred if she took the cat back when she meant to. **You** would have a claim to ask for those back too.\n\n* Showing that she neglected the cat and you cared for it very well, even **if** a judge agreed that legally you're in the wrong, they'd probably just award the value of the cat. Technically a judge *can* order the return of the pet itself, but she didn't even care about the cat so I just don't see it.\n\n* Here's a practical problem: If she wanted to sue you, she'd have to sue you where you are. She's moving to New York. Is she going to travel back and forth across states for this? Travel across states repeatedly for the slim chance that she maybe gets the cat and the more likely chance that she gets nothing and ends up owing *you* money for the trouble?\n\nIn short, congratulations on the cat.

If you have any phone calls with her you should be following up with an email summary of your call if she won't let you record them.\n\nYou are potentially gearing up for a legal battle so having all your evidence in hand is important. You want to be able to establish that she willingly handed over the cat, what that period of time was supposed to be, and any communication or communication attempts after she missed the initial return deadline. That doesn't necessarily override ownership laws but the more prepared you are the more prepared she needs to be too.", "Since Gravy chose you I believe he agrees.

If OP wants to sue to get the cat, they are free to do it. \n\nBut if you insist on comparing the 2. Even if a mom abandon her kid, the father can't just say \"I'm keeping him\".

NTA but I would consider getting actual legal advice.", "I was referring to if OP were to take the person to court for custody of the cat. Several comments under the post have referred to taking the friend to court. OP would probably win the case based on charges of abandonment. The proper channels at this point for OP would be going to court. Yeah, the father can't just say he's keeping the kid. But also shouldn't just give it back to the mother the first day she shows up after no contact for 7 months. That's not safe and opening the kid up to potential neglect from the mother. I didn't say in my original post it was an extreme comparison. Maybe OP should have just surrendered the cat to the shelter then legally adopted it from there. I still think OP did the right thing because it is saving that cat from potential neglect by the friend who didn't care about the cat for 7 months and saved the cat from having to be in a shelter.\n\nEdit: I meant to say, I *did say it was an extreme comparison in my original post.", "> But this is not a courtcase.

The only thing OP has to do is nothing.\n\nWhen people say \"possession is 9/10ths of the law\", this is the kind of stuff they're talking about. OP already *has* the cat. If nobody does anything, it remains OP's cat. If Jen wants the cat back, *she* has to take court action and convince the judge to get the cat back. And if she does, she may be entitled only to the value of the cat since it's legally just property, and she may open herself up to a counterclaim for all the expenses OP took on. **And**, she'd have to travel back and forth from New York to even pursue it (the jurisdiction of this issue is 100% where OP and the cat are located now).\n\nThe police will never take interest in this, it's mere civil theft. Not criminal theft. The burden is on Jen now.", "This isn't \"Is this legal to do\" though, it's \"Am I the Asshole\".  The cat is a living creature, whether it's technically the friend's property or not is immaterial to the morality of giving them back to an owner that abandoned them for 7 months and had been feeding them food they were allergic to before that.", "If I were OP, I'd be looking into local laws. A cat isn't a stereo--it needs attention and care. At a certain point, I think Gravy would be considered abandoned by its previous owner.\n\nI'd also offer the \"friend\" money to get a new cat just to smooth things over.", "The original owner abandoned the cat in OP\u2019s possession for months. I don\u2019t think the police would get involved, but this is purely based on my own experience trying to get some belongings of mine back from an ex. I called the non-emergency police number for an escort and was told that they do not get involved in property disputes unless there\u2019s a court order. Now I\u2019m sure if I went and kicked my ex\u2019s door in they\u2019d come, but as a rule they refer you to small claims court. \n\nI didn\u2019t really want to go through all that so I chalked it up to a lesson learned and moved on. Maybe your friend will decide it\u2019s not worth the hassle and move on.

If the cat is registered to her AND she asked for it back then I think technically it would meet the bar for theft if OP is refusing to return them.\n\nNot really. There was no breaking or entering, she willingly left the cat with OP to take care of (and then in most ways abandoned it).

There aren\u2019t any \u201ctests\u201d that a vet can do to determine if a cat has allergies, despite what this story suggests. If I cat is having stomach issues and the food is suspected to be the culprit, a vet will often suggest a few different foods and have you do trial runs with your cat to see how he/she responds. It can take a long time and the foods can be very expensive (prescription foods are often $80+/bag). We don\u2019t know what the cat\u2019s owner was or wasn\u2019t doing for him. \n\nI tried at least half a dozen different foods with one of my cats and he still periodically has diarrhea.

I agree give her some money and she\u2019ll probably leave OP alone", "I agree. As you said, needs to go through proper channels for official custody. But if I were OP, I'd be keeping the cat until the judge tells me to give it up. Cops would probably treat it like low cost property and say it's a civil matter and not force OP to give it up right away. They won't take the time to investigate the \"theft\". At the most, probably have the friend fill out a police report.", "NTA. \n\nHeres what to do next- \nGet all financial records from your spending on gravy.

Make sure you can give her an itemized total. It will probably be over $1000. My guess is that she'll want to drop the whole thing like a red-hot rock at that point.\n\nI hope you've preserved the texts sent that show she's abandoned the pet.

You have proof you tried to contact her and she ignored you.", "NTA. The cat was essentially an abandoned animal. Maintain the records of your attempts to contact her and any responses she did provide during that time. Contact animal control - you can inquire if there is a law about when an animal is considered abandoned (we have one in WA State) AND ask what the charges against her would be for abandoning an animal (second degree animal cruelty in WA and is a gross misdemeanor).

I agreed to catsit for a friend until she resolved her living situation. Upon receiving the cat, my now wife and I realized that the cat was super sick. As soon as I tried to contact cat's owner about it, we were ghosted. \n\nWe couldn't surrender the cat to the local no-kill shelter because there was a line of 360 cats to be surrendered in front of us. We worried a sickly black cat wouldn't stand a chance at a kill shelter.\n\nWe ended up taking the cat to the emergency vet since she was having trouble breathing. We found out she was sick because of severe neglect and exposure to black mold. The amount of care she needed cost us over $1200 USD before we even bought her medicine.\n\nWe had to give the cat daily baths for a skin condition (nightmarish to bathe a cat, btw) and give her oral medicine twice a day (also kind of nightmarish). The cat absolutely fell in love with my wife, who did the majority of the care, during this time. \n\nI reached out to the friend who had ghosted me and asked that she come get her cat and pay us back for at least some of the exorbitant vet bills. Neither of those things came to pass. \n\nThat's the story of how we wound up with our cat, Duckie--named that because of her tendency to follow my wife around like a little duckling.", "I hope you have receipts for the vet care and documentation that she abandoned the cat (proof of when she was supposed to return, proof she went no-contact, etc). If she had left him at a boarding facility they she would owe them thousands. And depending on local law the cat could have even been surrendered to a shelter in the meantime. \n\nThat\u2019s your cat. I highly doubt she would seek legal action against you, but if she did, I feel like you have enough evidence to prove Gravy was abandoned.", "NTA.

I was going to pay for her to be chipped but they scanned her first and gave me instructions to update her record; super easy and worth the peace of mind.", "I will, thank you.", "Not true at all. She abandoned the cat in the eyes of the law so she has zero legal recourse to reclaim him now. Most states consider an animal to be legally abandoned if it was left for more than 7 to 14 days depending on the state. OP originally agreed to watch the cat for a week and then agreed to an additional 4 days so 11 in total. Since the friend made no other arrangements for OP to watch the cat for longer, the clock would then start on day 12 and the law would deem that she abandoned the cat if it wasn't picked up within one or two weeks. Gravy legally belongs to OP now.", "In France the previous owner has to sign the papers for the update so that if the animal is stolen there is no way the thief can change the records. \n\nBut I agree with OP, the cat was abandonned for 7 months. They adopted it. Is there a law covering this where OP lives? If not I agree with the other Redditers, OP should hand over a bill covering all the expenses of caring for that cat and threaten to sue if the money isn't paid immediately. \n\nNTA.", "They have proof they tried to return the cat 7 months ago and Jen just refused.  I believe it would be enough for cops to say they have possession you abandoned the animal let the courts decide.", "This just made me realize that Ring cameras require more effort to take ownership of in the US than pets.

But also, regardless of I\u2019d you believe the story, the cat was basically abandoned. Doesn\u2019t matter the reason there was zero communication for months and OP and roommate have spent THOUSANDS on this cat at this point between medical and recreational.", "I wasn\u2019t really weighing in on who was the AH in this story overall. I don\u2019t honestly care about the other details. My only point was that allergies in cats can be tricky to diagnose and I don\u2019t feel that Jen having the cat on a food that wasn\u2019t right for him is, in and of itself, a sign that she\u2019s a bad pet owner. \n\nI owned 4 cats and I also foster and volunteer with an animal shelter, and I\u2019m a part-time cat sitter. To say that I\u2019ve worked with a lot of cats is an understatement. Many cats can eat any food and never have any issues with diarrhea or vomiting. But digestive issues in cats are common and can be caused by many things that aren\u2019t the owner\u2019s fault. \n\nObviously as someone who got their first cat under similar circumstances as OP (a cat sitting client abandoned their senior cat with me and I cared for her up until her death), I don\u2019t feel that they are they AH in this story.", "Your comment made it seem like you were arguing against it. I apologize for Misunderstanding. But, like I said, I looked up some basic stuff. It\u2019s not out of the realm of possibility that OP is paying a crap ton of money a month on cat food. My dogs diabetic food alone was almost $30 a bag. Those bills alone should help OP in a case to keep the cat. Roommate is delusional if she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s abandonment. And I don\u2019t mean that the wrong food is the friends fault. More like an oversight depending on how long she had had the cat.", "Oh sure, totally possible. The hypoallergenic food my one cat eats is up to $70/bag (plus tax). \n\nI think since the cat was only apparently 15 months old when left with OP, it\u2019s fair to say that Jen may have just not noticed the allergy yet. Allergies can develop later in life too, same as in humans. That was the only issue I had with the post, it seemed like it was demonizing her a bit unfairly for the allergy/food issue. She\u2019s still an AH for abandoning her cat though."]}
