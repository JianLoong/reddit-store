If your children don't feel they can confide in you or depend on you, that is not your brother-in-law's fault. It is not your children's fault. It is not your wife's fault. You need to look at what you are doing to be involved in their lives. Being present is not the end of the story when it comes to kids.\n\nThey say it takes a village to raise a child, and he is part of their village. Your post reads like you're more concerned about your feelings of jealousy than you are about anybody's well-being. This is all about your feelings of inadequacy, so maybe work on becoming adequate instead.", "INFO:\n\nHave you spent any time at all reflecting on why they feel closer to and more comfortable with him than you?\n\nBecause simply banishing him from your family is not going to solve your larger problem.", "YTA\n\nYou should be stepping *up* to improve your relationship with your kids, not asking BIL to step *down* so your relationship with them becomes better in comparison while actually staying the same.\n\nThat would just leave your kids worse off all round and makes it clear your primary motivation is a malicious jealousy of your BIL rather than love for your kids.", "YTA! Big time! You need to build a close relationship with your kids. That takes work. It doesn\u2019t sound like you are putting any effort in to get to know your children. Why didn\u2019t you know the tennis racquet that your daughter wanted? Why didn\u2019t you give her a meaningful gift.\n\nYou need to work on your anger issues and building trust and rapport with your family.", "YTA. No child is just going to be actively choosing their uncle or aunt over their parent if their parent is wonderful.\n\nHow much you want to bet you're a horrible father and that's why they prefer him. Your daughter feels more comfortable confining in her Uncle over panty liners than her Father. Doesn't that tell you something about yourself?", "YTA, and here's a hint: if your children felt comfortable with and loved by you, they would turn to you. The fact that they don't says way more about you than it does your BIL. Instead of picking pointless fights why don't you work harder on your relationships with your children?", "You are not wrong to want to be in your children's life, but YTA for kicking their uncle from their lifes\n\nLooks like you need to build a relationship with your kids. They are more attached to him because they feel better with him, so you probably have some work to do. You should start by apologise to everyone there. You would have more luck if you asked your BIL how you could be a better father to them", "YTA, instead of worrying if your kids are ok and being happy they have a bigger support system, you are worried about your own ego. And you wonder why your kids don\u2019t want to go to you for help.", "YTA and your kids are going to end up disliking you dude, so I suggest you apologize to your BIL for being jealous and work on your relationship with your kids without completely pushing out your BIL \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f you could\u2019ve had a more constructive conversation with him, any sane person would understand your feelings on the matter.

You might want to take a deeper look at why your kids feel more comfortable talking to their uncle as opposed to their dad. Without actually doing that, barring your BIL from their lives will do nothing but estrange them even further", "YTA. Your kids spent several of their formative years with their uncle as the primary caregiver by virtue of him being the adult that had the most time available to devote to them. You can\u2019t just change that dynamic by telling him to go away now, because they aren\u2019t going to magically start talking to you if he\u2019s not around. They\u2019ll get info from the internet, from their friends/peers or they won\u2019t talk to anyone and just struggle quietly.", "YTA and this won\u2019t make your kids like you", "YTA. You\u2019re extremely jealous. Maybe focus on being a safe place for your kids", "Cutting your children off from a trusted adult because of your own jealousy isn't going to get them to come to you with their personal issues.  There's a reason they're don't come to you for these issues but you're ignoring that and blaming your brother in law instead.  YTA", "YTA You\u2019re a jealous, unbearable man. Probably time to take a look in the mirror.", "YTA. You admit that BIL took care of them sometimes for days. You are jealous of your BIL and his relationship with your kids. So you decide to cut that relationship off. That\u2019s not going to magically make your kids confide in you. Instead you\u2019ve limited the number of trusted adults they can confide in or ask for help. What are you doing to foster your relationship with your kids? If you\u2019ve never been around you can\u2019t expect a relationship to happen overnight.", "You said \"Am I wrong to want to be in my children's life?\" No, but you are wrong for trying to force your children to be in your life by eliminating others that are \"challenging\" your perceived #1 spot. It's not a competition. \n\nIt seems like you are very focused on yourself, how much attention you are getting, how its affecting you instead of how its affecting your child. Try to think from your child's perspective and stay positive, even though it hurts to not feel as valued, and really try to engage with your kids and be there for them so that eventually they will feel comfortable coming to you for things. \n\nThis is coming from the perspective of the \"child\" that had a similar situation with an uncle (coincidentally), regardless of how its making you feel, the relationship your child has with the uncle is very important to them and shouldn't be taken away unless for a very good reason. Healthy relationships between kids and adults are super important for growth. Your child absolutely will resent you for taking that away and it will bring the opposite effect you are trying to get, and your kids will withdraw from you further. You could cause some long term damage as well.", "YTA\n\nMaybe talk to your kids and let them know you are always available for them to reach out to. That you love them and WANT to be involved with them and for them.\n\nPresent yourself more explicitly as an option to them rather than trying to eliminate someone they already clearly love and trust.", "YTA; ask yourself why your children feel more comfortable going to their uncle instead of punishing them by cutting off their source of comfort", "INFO: How much interaction do you have with your children on an average day?", "YTA. You and your wife were perfectly happy to take advantage of your brother and use him as a co-parent with your two children for years when it was convenient for you because oh boo hoo you were busy. And now you have the nerve to be upset that your children are actually close to him. Where have you been??!! Now you're just a jealous asshole.", "I kind of think if you want to be in your children's lives, then GET INTO THEIR LIVES.  There must be more to this story than what little you presented.  YTA for your reaction.", "YTA.  Look, wanting to be involved is a good thing, but that is an earned role.  Just going by the tone of the post, it sounds like OP expects to magically have their confidence and trust but hasn't put in the same work/effort as the other folks in their life.  I'd personally spend more time doing some self-reflection on this than getting angry at others.", "YTA. Your kids are not gonna trust just because he is not there. They will resent you because he is not anymore.", "YTA.\n\nWhy are you taking your children\u2019s safe haven away from them?", "YTA. Your children will resent you for forcing him out of their lives. You are possessive and controlling. You used him when you needed him and now you're throwing him away. You're not even thinking of your kids' feelings; you're only focused on yourself. You're happy to hurt them in order to get what you want. This won't make them love you more. This will make them really see how nasty and selfish you are.", "YTA - you owe him an apology big time!", "If you want to widen the divide between you and your kids, this is the perfect way to do it.  \n\nInstead of taking time to think about *why* your kids trust and seek support from their uncle over their father, you're lashing out and assigning blame.  It's you, pal.  You're the reason, not the BIL. \n\nIf you didn't want him to reap the rewards of a close relationship with these children, you shouldn't have asked him to do the work of being a parent to them.\n\nNow if you want to change that, there's still a chance that you can.  If it were me I'd be on my knees groveling to BIL - apologize and tell him that you're grateful for all that he has done for you and your family over the years.  And then start doing the work with your kids yourself.  Engage them, talk to them, spend time with them.  Prove that you're someone that can be trusted during vulnerable moments like illness or menstrual cycle emergencies. It will take time, but it's worth it.\n\nIf you try to take away someone they love and trust, they'll only hate you for it.  And rightly so.  Having additional loving, trustworthy adults in a child's life is a gift.  YTA.", "ESH \u2026 you handled this terribly.\n\nyour feelings are valid and you SHOULD be first for picking them up from school in emergencies, etc.\n\nYour wife and BIL should also understand how you\u2019d want your kids to not treat you as the second option.\n\nBut there\u2019s a much better way to talk about this, and you should be trying to enlist them both with sympathy for your position as the kids father, instead of trying to attack to get your way.\n\nTry again, apologize for yelling, and explain why this is so hard FOR YOU to your wife, and see if you get better results.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I've had my periods since I was 11 and I could never ever ever tell a man to buy me pads or tampons. It's just too weird and awkward for me.

I just stole some of her stash of pads which were in the bathroom. She replaced them whenever needed. No big deal.. just not something we talk about", "I jsur feel that it is the dad\u2019s responsibility only. People shouldn\u2019t have to step aside in order for dad to step up?
