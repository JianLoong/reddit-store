Big time! You need to build a close relationship with your kids. That takes work. It doesn\u2019t sound like you are putting any effort in to get to know your children.

Try to think from your child's perspective and stay positive, even though it hurts to not feel as valued, and really try to engage with your kids and be there for them so that eventually they will feel comfortable coming to you for things. \n\nThis is coming from the perspective of the \"child\" that had a similar situation with an uncle (coincidentally), regardless of how its making you feel, the relationship your child has with the uncle is very important to them and shouldn't be taken away unless for a very good reason. Healthy relationships between kids and adults are super important for growth. Your child absolutely will resent you for taking that away and it will bring the opposite effect you are trying to get, and your kids will withdraw from you further. You could cause some long term damage as well.", "YTA\n\nMaybe talk to your kids and let them know you are always available for them to reach out to.

Now you're just a jealous asshole.", "I kind of think if you want to be in your children's lives, then GET INTO THEIR LIVES.  There must be more to this story than what little you presented.

Just going by the tone of the post, it sounds like OP expects to magically have their confidence and trust but hasn't put in the same work/effort as the other folks in their life.  I'd personally spend more time doing some self-reflection on this than getting angry at others.", "YTA. Your kids are not gonna trust just because he is not there. They will resent you because he is not anymore.", "YTA.\n\nWhy are you taking your children\u2019s safe haven away from them?", "YTA. Your children will resent you for forcing him out of their lives. You are possessive and controlling. You used him when you needed him and now you're throwing him away. You're not even thinking of your kids' feelings; you're only focused on yourself.

It's you, pal.  You're the reason, not the BIL. \n\nIf you didn't want him to reap the rewards of a close relationship with these children, you shouldn't have asked him to do the work of being a parent to them.\n\nNow if you want to change that, there's still a chance that you can.  If it were me I'd be on my knees groveling to BIL - apologize and tell him that you're grateful for all that he has done for you and your family over the years.  And then start doing the work with your kids yourself.  Engage them, talk to them, spend time with them.  Prove that you're someone that can be trusted during vulnerable moments like illness or menstrual cycle emergencies. It will take time, but it's worth it.\n\nIf you try to take away someone they love and trust, they'll only hate you for it.  And rightly so.

An aunt or uncle is often another trusted adult in a kid's life. A little bit like a parent, a little bit like a sibling, a little bit like a friend.

She trusts me and knows if she doesn't want me to tell anyone else (not keeping any bad secrets, just typical tween angst kinda stuff) I won't and if she wants me to talk to her mommy (my sister) for her I will. Especially with your son discussing his sexual identity with his uncle first. That makes so much sense to me. He may have been very nervous about telling you and your wife and saw his uncle as a go-between. I understand you feeling left out but this isn't about you. It's about your children having an extra adult in their lives who they trust and who loves them. That's a good thing.

Stop making yourself busy around the house (cuz you\u2019re used to it and frankly don\u2019t know what else to do with yourself). Start making time available to be present at home, please. Sooo\u2026Make dinner (with kids helping do something), eat dinner together, have kid dates for one-on-one time. Hire landscaper and do bowling time instead, or something else together once a week, consistently, like even Chucky Cheese or Arcade time (just no movies). \n\nMost of all? Sit and talk with your kids (anywhere). What are their favorite things, their dreams? What do they love and dislike about school, their friends. You need time together. You\u2019ve likely missed out on all that by working, avoiding, busy time, working more, etc. Change your schedule and focus. \n\nNext, make amends with your BIL please. He\u2019s really stepped in (sacrificing his own life and time) for your kids. Please don\u2019t be angry that your kids are naturally closer to him because they\u2019ve spent so much time together. You\u2019re going to make yourself even more of the odd man out. \n\nShow your BIL gratitude and joy instead of jealous resentment. Your kids won\u2019t be as apprehensive of you if you do so. They\u2019re likely apprehensive because of awareness of the rift/resentment, and feeling in the middle. \n\nSpend time with the kids and look at them. Let them see you. Let them see you happy. Let them see you speak to them. Let them see you as you do things with them. Let them hear you ask questions. Let them hear you acknowledge them when they\u2019re speaking. Let them hear you compliment them. Let them hear I LOVE YOU. Let them hear you on the phone with them. So no texting, please call them instead. \n\nMake these changes to Be Present, Be There. This is really what your craving tbh. And no one can do it but you. So give new schedule and new calendar a try with your kids. You\u2019ll be so very glad you did. \n\nSo makeup with BIL and your Wife. Then start anew with new you, new schedule. You can do it. Bet you\u2019ll be Great!!! All the best\u2026.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udf40\ud83d\ude4f", "Oh, man!
