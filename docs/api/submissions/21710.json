I found a home and reached out to a family friend that is an experienced and well-achieved realtor that I trust. I felt comfortable working with him and now we are set to close in two weeks.\nWorking with him has been easy and we got a great deal.\n\nMy girlfriend (F27) will be joining me and paying minimal rent so she can focus on finishing her degree. We\u2019ve been together 7 years and it\u2019s a big next step for us.\n\nMy reasoning for not choosing my FMIL as a realtor was that I didn\u2019t want to mix family and business. I know my girlfriend and her mom have resentment over money and I didn\u2019t want to factor that into this huge decision. Furthermore, they don\u2019t have a great relationship and they struggle to communicate with FMIL without it becoming personal or an argument.\n\nIn an attempt to safeguard my relationship with FMIL I didn\u2019t involve her in my home buying process. I didn\u2019t want to seek her advice and have her feel used. I also was in-and-out of the market constantly and uncertain. I was worried that if anything went wrong in the process that would nuke our relationship.\n\nNow that I found a home I\u2019m serious about, I let my FMIL know. She was really upset. Some key words were \u201cbetrayal, lies, snake\u201d. We haven\u2019t spoken in over a week and I\u2019m no longer allowed at gf\u2019s house.\n\nI understand it must feel terrible as a realtor when family chooses someone else. I\u2019m certainly sympathetic that I hurt her feelings and want to mend that. I also get that as a new realtor she will need friends and families support.\n\nSome days I feel guilty, but I think I made the right choice.\n\nAITA?\n\nTLDR: Bought a house w/o gf\u2019s mom who is a realtor. She feels betrayed but I think I had good reasoning", "created_utc": 1688850788, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ufl8g/aita_for_not_choosing_my_girlfriends_mom_as_my/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is your choice to pick the realtor and I agree completely family and business should not mix.", "NTA. The desire to not mix business and family is legit. MiL is presuming on kinship. This does not bode well. Also, she must be a lousy realtor if she's willing to blow up her relationship with her daughter's partner to get a sale she didn't have to work for.", "NTA. I'm a professional in a different field, and don't like working with family and friends.  It almost always turns out that one of you feels used or gets hurt feelings. \n\nDon't know what you do about her mom, though. If she doesn't get over it soon, it's going to torpedo your relationship.", "There are a lot of reasons not to have a family member as your realtor, among them privacy.  A good realtor will know your financial situation so they know what you qualify for.  They'll connect you with good loan brokers and lending institutions with your finances and credit in mind, and things like your income, your savings, your credit history, how much you want to put down, may become relevant in the negotiation.  \n\nDo you want your FMIL to know that kind of info?\n\nAnother reason not to choose this particular family member is that she's inexperienced.  An agent who is well-known in the community as an ethical person who's highly skilled and easy to work with has a better chance of getting their client's offer accepted.  They also know what to look for structurally, how to interpret inspection reports, what it's actually going to cost to fix deficiencies, and how far they can push based on inspection reports and still get the property to close.\n\nFinally, your MIL's reaction to you selecting someone else suggests the glories of narcissistic injury.  No wonder she and your fiancee have a strained relationship!  I would suggest that you move forward knowing that this is not going to be an easy woman to deal with personally or professionally.  At least you dodged the bullet professionally.\n\nNTA", "Wow, super professional language she used. Sounds like you made the right choice.

You made good choices. Not mixing business and family was just one of them.\n\nMIL's reaction reinforces your good choice. If you'd chosen her, she would have been pressuring you all the way. \"This is a great place, buy it now!\" \"Of course you can afford this place!\"\n\nYou're seeing some of why gf and MIL's relationship is rocky.\n\nDon't feel guilty, don't try to mend anything.

She should then consider that she dodged the bullet.  You plan on living in this house for a while and every time that you saw her you\u2019d bring up another problem with the house.  Obviously, you\u2019re not going to that kind of a client with your realtor friend, but she has to understand that she\u2019s going to have clients like that and this is a great way of teaching her that family and business doesn\u2019t mix.
