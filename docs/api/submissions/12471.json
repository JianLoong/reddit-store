Get people to order mixed drinks with sugary sodas, not diet. Gatorade in between alcoholic drinks!", "NTA\n\nAs a non-drinker. I was often the drunk shepherd of my group.

I felt it gave me a way to still participate in the night and the fun they were having. So it was something I chose to do.\n\nThey should be avoiding causing problems like starting fights. If you give them instructions and they lie to you and say that they will follow them then don't, that was out of your control, especially since you weren't even there at the time.\n\nBefore the group even starts drinking they should of figured out a way for themselves to get home safely. My friends did this by we all crash at 1 persons house. We catch taxi to train, we train into city to drink, we catch train back, taxi back to house. I would make sure that the group stayed together and we all got on the train. I was not going to be responsible once you were going elsewhere.\n\nSorts of reasons why someone needed to be sober: that one time my friends *didn't see the car* and i had to reef them out about road rules and not sprinting across intersections at red pedestrian lights (funnily enough even while drunk no one did that again). Stopping the horse-crazy girl from literally running at the mounted policeman. Managed to talk her down to a slow approach and polite ask the cop if she could pat his horse, rather than startling them. Or the one time at a house where i helped intervene in a guy about to make a bad decision with a nightmare of a chick. I was basically there to try and stop drunk brains from making quick decisions badly.\n\nI still accept 0 responsibility for what drunk people do around me, and i state that openly. Why? Because sometimes they will be too quick or too stubborn or too strong for me to stop them. They drink, they don't manage themselves, they take the risk.", "NTA but you need to out a stop to being the babysitter for a bunch of binge drinkers.

I'm the anxious \"look after all the babies\" mother hen for my group, because I tend not to drink. It gets tiring having to be the parent and making sure that everyone is fine.\n\nAll this to say, it's not your job to make that he's home safely unless you've taken responsibility. If anything, you can keep an eye, but it's not your job. Adam is old enough to enjoy his time while being responsible as a father of kids... ... ...", "NTA maybe his wife should look out for him while she\u2019s drinking if she\u2019s so concerned", "NTA, but you're bringing this on yourself. They sound like terrible friends if this is regular behavior.  They are adults, if they can't take care of themselves, well that's on them.", "NTA. OP, I would send a group text. \"There seems to be some kind of misunderstanding. I go out with you guys to have fun, not to babysit adults. If you need a babysitter in the future, hire one. Otherwise, don't get so drunk that you can't find your way home, or you are going to endanger yourself. I am not responsible for you, and I do not appreciate the messages and things people have been saying to me lately that imply that I'm not babysitting someone enough.\"\n\nSeriously, OP. Why are you acting this way? You're not their moms...", "Eh, the wife probably doesn't want to leave the kids home alone. Though you're right about her needing to do something about this situation and not placing all the responsibility on OP.", "The wife shouldn't place ANY of the responsibility on OP - a married man and father of 3 children has no business going out if he can't be trusted to get himself home safely, actually if he's that pathetic he shouldn't be a husband or father!", "Sorry OP, but your friends sound shitty :/\n\nNTA", "You may want to gather your friends group over lunch some day (without booze) and have a serious discussion about how shit-faced y'all get, what lousy a look that really is, and whether it's maybe time to grow up a little.", "NTA.  You need new friends.  Which of them made sure you got home OK.  You should skip the next event and let them fend for themselves.   Unless you enjoy playing the martyr ?", "Then his wife can come babysit his drunk ass. Istg, this app makes me thankful every damn day to be single. NTA", "Honestly... I have a lot of trouble feeling sorry for people who routinely get blitzed out of their minds, and then expect others to take care of them... to protect them from their own foolishness and inability to drink responsibly. \n\nYou thought your friend was ok.  Your friend wound up being even more foolish than you expected, and go themself in a bad situation... and it was entirely their own fault.  Your friend's wife's anger is misplaced... it needs to be entirely focused on her drunkard of a husband.  NTA", "NTA.  He's a grown-ass man. You're not his mom nor even his wife. And it is different that he's male. A lot less likely he'll be raped if he walks home", "NTA\n\nY\u2019all sound exhausting. I hope you learn just how not your problem to fix these people are and start looking after your own enjoyment.", "Your friend is an alcoholic and his wife is taking out her unhappiness with his inability to be a partner or a parent on you. It\u2019s easier to blame someone else then realize your married to a selfish child.", "NTA\n\n\nMaybe the father of three kids should not get so drunk that he cannot get home. \n\nSeriously, wtf.", "or life360", "NTA. Your friends sound pretty high-maintenance.", "LOL", "Nta I think its time you tell them that you will no longer be taking care of them. It's not your responsibility to watch Adam or anyone else. They need to take responsibility for themselves. If his wife is that worry then she can hire a babysitter to watch the kids and she can go and watch Adam.", "NTA. Why can't it be Adam be the designated caretaker for once. Or I don't know, maybe go out with his wife and she can make sure he gets home? They can get a babysitter and celebrate St Paddy's Day. Unless she doesn't want the responsibility. You shouldn't always be the one stuck babysitting people your age and older. You need a break. Maybe find some different friends to go out with this time so you aren't there for them to rely on.", "NTA and it is not OPs responsibility to shepherd adults who apparently don't know their own limits and drink until they aren't safe. \n\nIt appears they are all immature enough to continue to drink too much but they all need to have Uber or Lyft on their own phones with their own accounts so they can get a ride when the night ends.", "NTA for \u201cabandoning\u201d your friend, but you\u2019re being an AH to yourself for keeping up the mothering of full grown alcoholics. Do not continue to take responsibility for their lack of, you don\u2019t need that kind of stress in your life.", "NTA. These people are ridiculous.", "Why are you more responsible for him than her? Does he not have a phone? Does she not have a fun? I would just text her at the end of the night, \"Adam is ready to come home, please get him at X bar.\"", "Info: how does the group behave when you can\u2019t join them?", "I\u2019m sorry, \u201cbefore [you] let him get himself in trouble\u201d???????!!! He\u2019s a grown ass adult. If he can\u2019t handle himself enough to not get so wasted then maybe his WIFE should be the one to make sure he gets home. Smdh NTA!!!!", "Did she explain how it was your responsibility to look after a married man with three kids? How does that work exactly?\n\nShe's a bad wife. She should shadow him around his haunts while he gets absolutely shitfaced and then drive him home. Or, of course, he could drink less.\n\nNTA and I'd tell her his safety was her concern from now on. You're going to enjoy your evening out without having to worry about the teenagers you're drinking with. It must be exhausting for you. I don't know how you (continue to) do it.", "Absolutely, completely,  spot on!!!!!", "My husband got a call from a taxidriver one night. One of his employees was passed out in the backseat, my husband's number was the last number called. My husband hopped on the computer to check this employees home address and gave it to the driver. The employee called the next day and apologized. No one else at the office knows about this.", "Your husband is a good dude"]}
