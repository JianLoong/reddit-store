Because you waited to see you're 3 friends (I'm guessing women) got home.  Made sure her husband walked the birthday girl home.

I have a friend who also acts similarly when she\u2019s drunk. I don\u2019t go out with her anymore. I got tired of babysitting.", "right that part", "I\u2019m definitely the mom of the group and find it frustrating at times.

She often initiates the \u201cit\u2019s home time\u201d\n\nThe others\u2026 it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s even annoying that the birthday girl wasn\u2019t in the night mind enough to realise my friend walking home would mean he\u2019d be walking through dodgy areas. Even them getting involved in another group drama\u2026.\n\nAlthough there was a hilarious eye contact moment where the sensible friend of that group was impressed by wrangling skills. \n\nI\u2019ve talked to them both about how when they get in that state it dampens our fun. But they know I\u2019m always going to at least try to get them sorted. Especially BG she\u2019s got in some bad positions before on nights out with other people. If anything happened to her on my watch I\u2019d never forgive myself. I feel they take advantage.", "Tbf she couldnt leave the kids at home to pick him up\n\nEdit: couldnt", "Tbf to the others they tend to be decent and are now more aware of how often it\u2019s me getting people home. Adam amd birthday girl are the main culprits. Especially birthday girl. \n\nAdam never \u201cremembers\u201d his behaviour.

He doesn\u2019t go out much and has 3 under 3 at home so I think he goes hard as it\u2019s the only time he is allowed out. But he and BG definitely have alcohol issues.

I was going home with them. 1 was staying at my place. The taxi dropped the others off first. . I would of put Adam in my taxi but there was no room and he doesn\u2019t live near me. I originally was trying to order a taxi for both  BG and Adam. But since they were getting involved in other drama I did the whole \u201cwill you take BG home and see she gets in okay. Sure wait there for a taxi\u201d to him And \u201chey he\u2019s off his face and will get int rouble if we wait here. Can he get a taxi from yours\u201d so they wouldn\u2019t get in trouble. \n\nit took me an hour to get one taxi. And my other friends weren\u2019t willing to wait. He lives in the opposite direction as us. So I\u2019d probably have had to order his taxi wait for him to get it and order one for myself. In a severe taxi shortage that could have meant o wouldn\u2019t get home to 6am\n\nBut I would be more careful with female friends. There have been SA in that area. I\u2019m not saying all SA have female victims but it\u2019s arguably less sfe for a drunk woman than a man. \n\nBut also I provided him with a plan and a safe place to wait. Why is it my job to get him home, if he won\u2019t even do the basics for himself. I kept him out of a fight. I got him to go to a safe place. Why is the onus on me?", "How does the wife have any reason to be upset that OP didn\u2019t get him home? Why does she expect her to get him home? Clearly from the new message she expects OP to be his baby sitter. The wife is the AH", "And if she can't leave the kids to pick him up, since she has his location, she can call him an Uber.", "No OP. Text her what you told us. And inform her it\u2019s HIM who should be reminded about the kids if he chooses to drink until passing out. \nNot your monkey not your circus. \nMaybe HE shouldn\u2019t drink if he can\u2019t hold his liquor. And obviously he can\u2019t if everyone already predicts he\u2019ll need a keeper", "As a nondrinker I was always the responsible one in my group, and especially as women was so anxious about anything bad happening.  It took me a while to realise that if they're old enough to go drinking, they're old enough to look after themselves.", "yet she could have arranged the taxi too.  Why you think this is your job, to herd a pack of drunks into taxi's is really beyond me.", "Fair, but she could have sent a taxi\n\nbut the bigger issue is... in light of what happened *last* time, they are mature adults with the ability to plan for *next* time.\n\nThey can schedule a ride for him to go home on St Patrick's day. \n\nInstead she's making that *your* responsibility.\n\n...but honestly it sounds like these people are all using you as a free babysitter. I wouldn't be okay with that. Are you okay with that?", "Thats on them to plan - she should be having conversations with him about why a father of three is so inebriated he can't get home without falling asleep in someones garden. Its not your issue.", "If she can't leave the house to get her drunk af husband back home, then they need to have a serious conversation about his drinking habits because that's not a good way to go through life.   \n\n\nYou're NTA but goddam the drinking culture y'all are involved in is not a good path.", "Did you read where multiple times I said I agree with you i just can understand the wife side?  \n\nNot sure why you added that last paragraph\n\nEdit to add:  Also doesn't make since BG lives a block away but you all waited outside for an hour for a taxi. Next time just walk to the closest person house and wait there.", "I just get where she's coming from. If my partner was very drunk and out with friends and their friend made sure everyone got home safely but them I would be mad at both of them.  My partner for getting drunk and the friend for just leaving them. \n\nPersonally, I'll prob just have some internal anger against the friend and not say anything, but I do get why the wife is upset.  \n\nMaybe it's different because I'm a straight man and my partner is a woman so may have more of a reason to worry.  But I do get where she's coming from", "Text from Uber:  Is he the passed out guy in the garden?", "That\u2019s the bit that always gets me. What if I do abandon them and they get in trouble. The birthday girl has got into strangers cars before thinking it was an Uber.", "I added the last paragraph because you\u2019re summary of \u201cfor him, just order your own taxi\u201d leaves out the fact that I got him to go to a safer place, where he also has the option of staying the night. It wasn\u2019t like I got everyone else home and abandoned him at the bar.", "But she didn\u2019t just leave him. She tried for an hour to get one taxi while trying to get the friend to get his own. I think from what she says she made a decent attempt to get him home. When that didn\u2019t work she sent him to a nearby house. If she left him at the club that would be different. You can lead a horse to water\u2026\n\nShe tried. But from her own description to stay with him would have got her home hours later.  And probably meant she\u2019d be waiting for a taxi on her own.\n\nShe also mentions him being aggressive and annoying her. Maybe she didn\u2019t feel comfortable being left alone with him.\n\nAs a woman if my male friend is picking fights im out of there.\n\nIf your partner had to wait on her own for a taxi for hours because her friend wouldn\u2019t look after himself wouldn\u2019t you be pissed?", "Ask them to rotate the designated driver/mother hen/ taxi caller.  You are not abandoning them if you also want to have fun.  Bring it up before the next outing and ask who is going to step up as your turn is over for the next year.  They need to rotate it.", "She needs to realise she's responsible for her own safety, and needs to stop drinking so much.  I know it sounds harsh, but you can't do everything for them - what happens if you're ill and they want to go out - do you drag yourself from your hospital bed and keep an eye on them?  When they understand they have to grow up they might surprise you with their ability to survive.  It's nice to be needed but you will end up resenting this parent- child relationship, when it's supposed to be a relationship of equals.", "What happens when they go on holiday? Do you travel with them to make sure they're safe? No, of course not!  If their drinking habits are causing them harm or putting them at risk they need to sort it out, not you."]}
