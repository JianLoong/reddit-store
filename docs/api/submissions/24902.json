I'd reframe it as paying for the trip for your son, as him having his boyfriend there will make the vacation more enjoyable for him. It's not very nice for his sibling to all have partners there, paid for by you, and for him not to have a companion, too. You obviously have plenty of money, and most college kids can't afford flights, so saying he can come if he pays his way may not be a very meaningful offer.", "\u2075_p to t", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's probably actually a timing/budgeting thing on OP's part (plane tickets are hard to deal with last minute and the prior partner did apparently reject it) or possibly a realization that paying for the partner of the week would be a bit silly, but if OP didn't communicate that (and the son is pretty self centered and/or not thinking about OP's reasons because they're upset lol) then it's a not entirely baseless accusation from their perspective.

You can't control everything. \n\nI will say though, do you want to be that guy who goes out to dinner and makes the one odd person out pay for their own salad? Do you want to be that guy, who has to leave one person back at the hotel, because that person said that they couldn't afford to rent jet skis or whatever? Again, you didn't specify what paying for everything would look like. If they're paying for all their drinks at the bar, absolutely fair. But if you offered to invite people, then it becomes your responsibility to be a good host. At the very least, boyfriend should know what costs are covered and how much he should be expected to spend out of his own pocket. \n\n\nYour son is definitely being ridiculous bar none though. He could at least negotiate with you and good faith but he's just being a baby.", "NTA because it's strange to have a stranger at a family event as a guest, and worse when that event is a week long, and *really* awkward on a boat \n\nI like the idea of either having son bring a long-term friend or telling FOTD that he can be there as the photographer", "NTA I think your son promised his friend a free vacation.\n\nThis way he doesn't feel like a third wheel so to speak.\n\nYou can always ask the friend to step away in family pictures.", "NTA, but it's your wife's birthday too.

Although, you do mention that the girl he was dating didn\u2019t want to come because it would be awkward. This implies that you extended an invitation and she refused right? It is a little suspicious if you asked his short-term girlfriend but not his short-term boyfriend.\n\nBut finally, I don\u2019t know that it was unreasonable for your son to ask or expect you to pay for his SO and here\u2019s why. You\u2019re spending a lot of money flying in his siblings\u2019 SOs. So from his perspective you\u2019re spending at least twice as much on his siblings than him, and that might not seem fair. I feel like it\u2019s a difference in perspective of whether you\u2019re paying for individuals to come or you\u2019re paying for your siblings and then the guests they choose. In his mind you\u2019re willing to spend say $3,000 on each of his siblings so the people they love can join, but you\u2019re limiting him to $1,500 because he hasn\u2019t been able to find a long-term partner. So not only will it be rubbed in his face that everyone else is happy, he\u2019s being financially punished. \n\nAgain I feel like both sides have some merit. I know people who jump from partner to partner and fall madly in love with each one. And they can be straight up delusional about how much other people want to see their SO. No, I don\u2019t want your boyfriend to come to girls night, why would I want that? \n\nThe biggest reason why I\u2019m feeling that the son might be upset is it sounds like all of his siblings are married or have been dating long term. At this massive party and any activities on the houseboat, they will all already be paired off. Being the only single person on a boat full of couples, even if they\u2019re family, seems kind of rough. As one of the younger people in my extended family, I\u2019ve been on family vacations where the couples go to do stuff and I\u2019m used as a free babysitter.

What, are you flying in the cargo hold?", "He's throwing pocket sand at the angels now.\n\nor equally likely that Rushy Shackelford just checked into a long stay hotel in Guadalajara.", "Other commenters have pointed this out above but most people who get married spend at least that on a wedding day and are far from loaded. 22k on a holiday is much better value, IMHO.", "I'm not sure it's a trend but I have experienced this before. One of my best friends through middle and high school is gay. He and I were roommates our first year of college. We obviously found different friend groups to be a part of while being there. We were still friends, though, and our friend groups mixed. I met several men who made the cattiness stereotype their full identity, which in turn just made them annoying and miserable to be around. Anytime one of my friends or I didn't like hanging out with them, they would tell my friend we're just homophobic and he doesn't realize it because he's \"newly out.\" He never listened because he knew us, and it was 2 or 3 of all his friends he didn't particularly prefer anyway.", "Wait! Are you saying there is a new trend of people (typically more immature ones) using whatever vulnerability or \u201ctrump\u201d card they to manipulate people it getting their way? \n\nAlso I HATE HATE HATE this trend from people who attribute common or universal negative behavior to specific identities as if it was due to their identity that they were acting bad. \n\nAs if somehow if this minority group just behaved and didn\u2019t act in such a way people wouldn\u2019t also be mean to the \u201cgood ones\u201d. \n\nHaha sorry for being so sarcastic but I think it does illustrate my point. I do agree it\u2019s frustrating when people are manipulative especially for stuff that can be a mine field.", "Well it\u2019s multiple families going on a vacation, it\u2019s $10k for a family of 5 to go to Disney.", "Yeah I think it cost us like 10k to go to Mexico with 6 people. Pretty easy to throw money at a vacation. \n\nI have 10k for a 9-10day trip to Europe for my SO and I. Not including the plane tickets.", "Yeah I am on the same page with you.  Just adding a little color that we don't know how long OP has been saving for this, and to me it is more reasonable than \\*some\\* weddings I hear about.  Our wedding was significantly more expensive than yours, but cheaper than most and pretty cheap for the size (\\~200).", "Yeah I think that\u2019s just something you\u2019re making up. Lol. But nice try.", "Family dynamics are tough when sharing space on a houseboat. Throw in a stranger and it becomes a nightmare. Your son should recognize the huge gift , and be gracious for the vacation and time to spend with his family .", "As I\u2019m seeing this, it\u2019s 14 hours since you commented this. \nIf put money on them being broken up already.", "Especially when the people you don\u2019t know are from a rich family...", "Without knowing this guy, they could be volatile on this trip. It's about family and this isn't a backyard barbecue. An expensive trip like this could be ruined if their relationship starts falling apart by then. I wouldn't want to allow a wildcard like this on an expensive family trip, much less pay for him to come. It has nothing to do with gender.", "You can't get the refund, unless you use points. The refund will go to the ticket holder only. If you use points to buy the ticket, they'll just go back to your account if you cancel.", "I like the idea of a traditional weeding. A little light liquidation every once in a while", "I mean... weddings cost more than that and that is 1 day only. With this being a special anniversary (30yrs) and wife's birthday (50) it is reasonable for them to make plans like this. It is like a second wedding.", "7 people, op also mentions a sister and her wife", "That was my point. The money is being spent on an extravagance that brings joy, happy memories, good times...whatever. Buying a luxury vehicle that you enjoy driving instead of a base-level econobox is the same thing. Yet people are amazing that anyone would spend that much money on a vacation while ignoring the fact that people spend equivalent amounts on other frivolous things like cars."]}
