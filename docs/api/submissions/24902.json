It's about him only being with this person for a month. Who in their right mind would expect a person to pay for a vacation for a complete stranger?!", "NTA. It sounds like you've never met. It's super rude for him to expect you to pay without even an introduction.", "NTA.  Your son just has a series of fuck buddies and this guy is the latest one.  The fact that your son jumped right to the over-played and inaccurate \"homophobia\" claim proves that he's just an entitled jerk.  Don't pay for the guy's ticket.", "Personally, I wouldn\u2019t want to be trapped on a boat with someone none of the rest of the family knows very well, whether they pay or not. One month is not long enough to take a family vacation together. I think your son\u2019s expectations are unrealistic and unreasonable. He might also consider that If absence makes the heart grow fonder, presence in a small stateroom on the family vacay may just be the heart killer. \n\nNTA", "Nta this person is a complete stranger itd be weird for them to come", "NTA\n\nYou know everyone else you are paying for. You don't know the boyfriend and are not a piggy bank for someone else's vacation. It's not homophobic to refuse to pay for someone's vacation.", "NTA. He\u2019s getting free accommodation and getting fed. Just needs to pay for a flight? Who wouldn\u2019t snap that up?", "NTA. First, it's your money, you choose what to do with it. Second, if you didn't know about the boyfriend, then why should the boyfriend now be your problem? And you're not homophobic for not wanting to pay for someone you didn't know about until then. Your son's the AH for calling you homophobic for something not homophobic, it's petty.", "NTA. Your son sounds entitled af no offense.", "NTA. Why should you pay for someone you haven't even met?", "1st, The bf wanting to go on a family vacation on a boat  with a large family he has never met is just weird and would be awkward, especially for something as intimate as a anniversary.\n\n2nd, just the idea that you should be expected to pay for a complete stranger, that you never met, and didn't even know existed until the vacation was brought up?  \n\nMan, rich people have a whole new set of problems than regular people.", "NTA \n\nIf boyfriend wants to come, then he can pay for his own way.", "NTA and not homophobic either lol", "Nta. He didn't even properly introduce you to his new bf or give you and the family a chance to get to know him yet.\n\nI wouldn't pay for the flavor of the month either...\n\nIt's not homophobic.", "No considering you didn\u2019t even know of his new partner.", "nta - just tell your son you will pay for the next time there is a trip and the relationship lasts longer than he changes his underwear.", "NTA. He sounds like an Insignificant Other.\nNTA because the holiday.goes for longer than his relationship has so far. \n\nPut a time limit on such events now and for ever eg dating for more than 9 months", "NTA. \nWhat same person would want to be surrounded by strangers for a week with no chance of escape, anyway?", "You\u2019ve never met this guy, but you\u2019re EXPECTED to pay for his vacation? NTA.", "Hopefully you can transfer the ticket to your SO du jour. NTA.", "NTA, 6mo- 1 year together would be my rule for something like paying for vacation", "I\u2019m sorry but what!!! Unless you knew the bf and they been dating for a long time, you shouldn\u2019t be paying for anyone. Even if you did, it\u2019s your choice. Your money. You son sound entitled and bratty. NTA", "It's a family event for your wife's 50th and your wedding anniversary. This BF knows nothing about you and has never met you. I wouldn't want him there even if he was willing to pay for his own ticket. And given how long your sons relationships last, this BF might not even be in the by the time the vacation starts.", "NTA it's like that How I met your Mother episode where Ted brought a new girl in the yearly photo every year. This is a big event for you and your wife. I think it's more appropriate to have people there you have known for longer. Seeing photos of past exes at important events is just embarrassing enough, without it being a person you probably spent a month with.", "Your money, you decide what you pay for.", "NTA.  But it\u2019s going to cost less to cover the flavor of the month than to burn a bridge with an immature kid.", "NTA. Your son seems like a playboy but that's his business. I wanna know if the boyfriend is also onto this but just to be clear, what's the price for about one person?", "NTA. The entitlement to complain about a free vacation and expect others to pay for just a boyfriend or girlfriend", "NTA.   \n\n\nHe needs to build his reputation for his lover's future family or future family. By that  what i mean is respect and all.", "NTA - Tell your son it\u2019s not about wether it\u2019s a boyfriend/girlfriend but that you only pay for people who have been long term in the family. \n\nPaying for someone he probably won\u2019t be with in a few weeks is wasted money. If he\u2019s still with the same partner in a year, you\u2019re open to paying for a holiday if you\u2019re going on a family holiday.", "No my mom did that with my step sister boyfriend who was going to come to their wedding", "NTA.  He can\u2019t just invite people on a trip he didn\u2019t pay for.  Idk it just seems rude to me.  We\u2019ve seen these posts before.  Planned vacation and then a friend invites their partner without asking.  Everyone else is uncomfortable and its weird.  I mean his boyfriend didn\u2019t invite himself,  but your son seems to think you\u2019re well off, and that may be true, but he shouldn\u2019t take advantage of that and assume you will pay for everything.  He should pay or his boyfriend pays.  Dude I don\u2019t think you\u2019re homophobic but you don\u2019t sound completely supportive of his sexuality.  you are crossing a line judging him for having many partners.  It\u2019s not your business and keep your opinions about that to yourself.   And do not hold it against him.  He\u2019s young and living it up.   If you do,  you would be terrible.  Do you support him financially? School, living arrangements, spending money ?", "Ehhh soft YTA. Your reasoning makes sense enough but you also clearly have the means to pay for it and barely notice the difference. And I feel a little sympathy for your son - it\u2019s hard being the only sibling without a significant other, it\u2019s also hard (especially these days) existing as a gay/bi person\u2026 it seems worthwhile enough to fly the kid out so your kid can enjoy his vacation a little more.", "NTA tell your son that you will book a ticket for whoever he is dating, but not until the day of travel so that the ticket will be in the correct name.", "YTA. I'd reframe it as paying for the trip for your son, as him having his boyfriend there will make the vacation more enjoyable for him. It's not very nice for his sibling to all have partners there, paid for by you, and for him not to have a companion, too. You obviously have plenty of money, and most college kids can't afford flights, so saying he can come if he pays his way may not be a very meaningful offer.", "\u2075_p to t", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You barely know the person, he's just started dating him, and he has the nerve not only to expect you to allow him to come to a family vacation, but also pay for him, and then call you homophobic for not agreeing? This is something I wouldn't budge on even if it causes friction for now, because it sets a poor precedent. I hope your son sees reason and things work out.", "NTA if he was in a long term serious relationship, I would vote different, but then you probably wouldn\u2019t be here because you would pay.

I wouldn't even let him come. the only reason your son wants him there is sex. You want a casual, relaxed week with people you know and love. Not some rando you don't know--and honestly your son doesn't *really* know. He's a stranger. Like you said, this dude will be in all your family photos of that week. He'll be part of the memories. If he's a flavor of the month, it's going to be a weird moment in your life. \n\nLay it out to him like that--you've never met him, and a week long vacation to celebrate a family member isn't the way you want to do it. You want to relax and have fun, not deal with entertaining a stranger or struggle with making sure he's comfortable and not feeling like a 'third wheel'.", "Too soon for me. He\u2019s a stranger and you\u2019re not even sure how long this will last. NTA\n\nI mean when my then girlfriend of four months came on a family vacation. They took care of lodging but we split our expenses and I paid my aunt (she was handling the joint funds) back. \n\nYou\u2019re right about the family pictures.

It's might be lonely while everyone is coupled up \n\nYou're by no means *obligated* to pay for the new boyfriend, but it would be a nice thing to do, especially if the money is of little consequence for you\n\nI'm taking op's comment regarding how frequently his son changes partners with a grain of salt-i don't know how many partners this guy has *actually* had in a year, only that his dad's perception is that its too many, and that's relative.", "NTA -\nNOPE Why should you pay for someone he JUST started dating?  Idc if they are a boy, girl or fish! He has only been with this person for a few weeks at most,  may be broken up by the time of the trip.  You said they were welcome (which is very gracious)  but they have to buy their own flight ticket.  That's more than fair.  You'll be paying for the boat,  fuel, food etc.  Buying a ticket is still a damn good deal for a vacation!", "NTA, but given the circumstances, I think I would just pay.", "NTA - Your son just escalated the situation by calling you homophobic and an AH, when you're not. It's your money and your special occasion for your wife and family so you can decide who comes and who you pay for.", "NTA \n\nI have to assume if the girl he was dating didn\u2019t want to go on the trip because their relationship was too new then your sons relationship with his boyfriend has to be even shorter than his last. \n\nIt\u2019s not unreasonable to not want to pay for your sons new piece to keep him warm at night.", "also what are the odds they\u2019re still together at that point?", "Exactly which is why I didn\u2019t put down my ex as a plus one for my brothers wedding.

And guess what we\u2019re not together by the time the weeding came. He did meet this brother (I have two) and his wife.

The OP isn't an AH here because there's no reasonable expectation to pay for a child's new partner who hasn't met the family yet. But I can think of many situations where the OP could be the AH despite \"your money, your rules\".", "Mo money, mo problems!", "This is the best advice I've seen so far. Flavor of the month, just so your son won't be lonely. Hopefully the boyfriend will be a decent human being to be stuck on a boat with for 5 days.", "really his son can be with a different person weekly if that's what he wants but he shouldn't expect his family to treat his FOTM as family and pay for their vacation.", "I like your post but would lean more NAH the kid is not the asshole for being upset and the dad is not really the asshole for saying no here but it would be nice to support his son and help him enjoy his vacation.", "This one took a bit of thinking. But I wound up at a surprising soft YTA. I think being hesitant due to your son only dating his boyfriend for a short time before attending such an important party is perfectly reasonable. But I can\u2019t wrap my head around the boyfriend being \u201cmore than welcome\u201d but then turning around and imposing the financial burden on only him. If you don\u2019t want a one-month bf there who you\u2019ve never met, draw that line. Your son would likely be just as upset but the dangling of his bf attending if he jumps through the financial hoop just seems petty.", "Or worse yet they break up during the vacation and the entire event gets awkward and uncomfortable ruining it for the rest of the actual family.", "That's true. But I wouldn't want to be expected to pay for someone who can pay themselves unless they helped with some of it. But that's just my opinion.", "I know I just wanted to let dad know not to voice his opinion out loud to his son.   I mean he\u2019s young. Let him enjoy himself.  I think son is getting everything paid for by dad and he\u2019s entitled now to anything he want l.  Rich kid never had to worry about anything and  accusing his dad if being a being homophobic because he couldn\u2019t get his way.  It\u2019s manipulation.  Dad I support you and honestly this is just my thought.  You have not verified it.    It\u2019s a guess.", "I didn\u2019t even think of that. That\u2019s a lot of pressure in a new relationship. Being on a houseboat in a different state with a new SO and their entire family sounds like a recipe for disaster and my personal nightmare as an introvert with some social anxiety."]}
