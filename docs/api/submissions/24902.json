I mean his boyfriend didn\u2019t invite himself,  but your son seems to think you\u2019re well off, and that may be true, but he shouldn\u2019t take advantage of that and assume you will pay for everything.  He should pay or his boyfriend pays.  Dude I don\u2019t think you\u2019re homophobic but you don\u2019t sound completely supportive of his sexuality.  you are crossing a line judging him for having many partners.  It\u2019s not your business and keep your opinions about that to yourself.   And do not hold it against him.  He\u2019s young and living it up.   If you do,  you would be terrible.  Do you support him financially? School, living arrangements, spending money ?", "Ehhh soft YTA. Your reasoning makes sense enough but you also clearly have the means to pay for it and barely notice the difference. And I feel a little sympathy for your son - it\u2019s hard being the only sibling without a significant other, it\u2019s also hard (especially these days) existing as a gay/bi person\u2026 it seems worthwhile enough to fly the kid out so your kid can enjoy his vacation a little more.", "NTA tell your son that you will book a ticket for whoever he is dating, but not until the day of travel so that the ticket will be in the correct name.", "YTA. I'd reframe it as paying for the trip for your son, as him having his boyfriend there will make the vacation more enjoyable for him. It's not very nice for his sibling to all have partners there, paid for by you, and for him not to have a companion, too. You obviously have plenty of money, and most college kids can't afford flights, so saying he can come if he pays his way may not be a very meaningful offer.", "\u2075_p to t", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's often less the actual thing the person is doing that's a problem rather than how they do it.

But a great deal of the time the person is getting called transphobic for how they acted/reacted, but other people will then assume it's a \"boy who called wolf\" situation even though it's not. For example, if you call a woman a \"tr\\*ap\" because you didn't realize they have a penis, that's a slur and you are a transphobe, even if your desire not to date penised individuals is completely valid.

It's probably actually a timing/budgeting thing on OP's part (plane tickets are hard to deal with last minute and the prior partner did apparently reject it) or possibly a realization that paying for the partner of the week would be a bit silly, but if OP didn't communicate that (and the son is pretty self centered and/or not thinking about OP's reasons because they're upset lol) then it's a not entirely baseless accusation from their perspective. OP didn't actually help much (\"my daughter's wife will be there\" is only a couple steps up from \"I have gay friends\") since rather than explaining the reason why they weren't paying they apparently reacted to the accusation and then dismissed everything which isn't very constructive.
