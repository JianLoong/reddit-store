He should pay or his boyfriend pays.  Dude I don\u2019t think you\u2019re homophobic but you don\u2019t sound completely supportive of his sexuality.  you are crossing a line judging him for having many partners.

Do you support him financially? School, living arrangements, spending money ?", "Ehhh soft YTA. Your reasoning makes sense enough but you also clearly have the means to pay for it and barely notice the difference. And I feel a little sympathy for your son - it\u2019s hard being the only sibling without a significant other, it\u2019s also hard (especially these days) existing as a gay/bi person\u2026 it seems worthwhile enough to fly the kid out so your kid can enjoy his vacation a little more.", "NTA tell your son that you will book a ticket for whoever he is dating, but not until the day of travel so that the ticket will be in the correct name.", "YTA. I'd reframe it as paying for the trip for your son, as him having his boyfriend there will make the vacation more enjoyable for him. It's not very nice for his sibling to all have partners there, paid for by you, and for him not to have a companion, too. You obviously have plenty of money, and most college kids can't afford flights, so saying he can come if he pays his way may not be a very meaningful offer.", "\u2075_p to t", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If my daughter asked me to buy a plane ticket for some boyfriend I had never met, I\u2019d tell her to go kick rocks.", "Your story doesn't make sense....\"for summer vacation this year\" Are you in the southern hemisphere, and summer is coming soon in the next months?   \n\nIf you're in the northern hemisphere, and you mention University on the East Coast, which suggests the US? Or do you mean $22,000 AUD or USD? If US, you don't have to make any decisions until next year?", "NTA. If he changes partners frequently and you didn't even know this person exists then no. You're spending more than enough.", "OP what do you do for a living? Would love to be able to spend 22k plus for an event and fly my fam out", "NTA do not pay solely based on his comment. When people don't agree to do something for you, you can't just say they are homophobic. Son needs to learn that those kinds of comments are not okay. His new bf can pay his own way.", "NTA, It would be a waste of money to fly a guy out that you have no connection to and it could make things awkward.", "NTA at all.  \n\n\nYour son probably just want to impress his new love with a free vacation, my guess is that none of them will care at all about your birthday or your anniversary. \n\nCongrats on both.", "It's possible none of the girlfriend's lasted long because your son is gay and has only recently figured things out. Or maybe he's bisexual and can't commit to anyone. Doesn't matter, they've been dating a month and it's unreasonable to be expected to pay for him. NTA", "Not the asshole. A month is not a committed relationship.", "NTA, but your son is.", "Who TF pays for a total random? The other SO\u2019s, come because if they\u2019re married then they\u2019re now extensions of the family, but the other dude? Nah.", "Your son is the real asshole. Acting entitled. You never even met this guy so why would you pay for him?", "I\u2019m going to disagree with most of the other comments here -YTA. \n\nTry to see this from your son\u2019s perspective. You\u2019re paying for everyone else to bring their partner, but not him. It will seem to him that you value him less than you value your other children. It also means that he will be the only one there without a partner, so he could spend a lot of the trip feeling left out/lonely. \n\nYou\u2019re not being homophobic, but if he is in the first flush of love with his bf then he is also going to be hurt by your judgment that this relationship is not going to last (even if you turn out to be right!). Presumably at some point, one of his relationships will turn out to be \u201cthe one\u201d and it\u2019s just possible that this is that relationship. \n\nYour son at present is feeling undervalued and judged, and is likely to feel resentment towards you (and possibly his siblings) for the duration of the holiday. If you can afford to pay for his bf to attend then that may well cause fewer problems than having an angry bitter son at the party starting arguments with everyone he\u2019s feeling aggrieved with. \n\nI understand that you are wary at having a stranger at your family gathering, but is there any way you could get to know the bf better before the event? Even if not in person, then over a video call or similar? This might help assuage your concerns.", "NTA. Hahaha wow the nerves of some people", "NTA\nA point on the photos. I got married abroad thinking family wouldn't come - they all moaned about us marrying two hours away from our hometown as we'd moved and there'd been a lot of arguments.\n\nWe ended taking both sides of the family and the week after we returned my mother and sister broke up with their long term partners. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is length of relationship is no indicator of who will end up annoying you in photos.\n\nIf the bf does go, as others said make him take some photos of the family so you have some", "NTA-  My mom started to sound my brother this house is not your hotel room. You only bring back my future daughter in law here. Like you said he change girlfriend like laundry.", "nta", "NTA, this isn\u2019t homophobia. It\u2019s just not paying for a random who has been with your son less than a month", "NTA the boyfriend shouldn't even get an invite. \n\nYou could also be petty and tell the boyfriend to buy his own ticket and that you'll reimburse him when he gets there. Maybe he won't get there. Maybe he won't think he'll get there and won't buy the ticket.", "NTA. You can tell your son that either he pays for his partner or his partner pays for the tickets. This was standard in my family was that you could invite an SO on the big annual trip, but if you and that SO broke up before the trip, you would be on the hook for the SO\u2019s ticket. It made you really think carefully about whether the relationship was committed enough to go on the trip. Neither I nor any of my siblings tested the clause because we usually would not invite a SO along until it was serious or we were engaged. The threat of the clause was enough to make us think carefully about who we invited on the trip.", "So your son will be the only single in your vacation? Yeah, what a fun for him. Sure, 20something love to vacate with their parents and it won't be a bit boring or weird for him to be there with only couples (or their little kids?) \n\nYTA. It doesn't seem to be a money problem. It would make is vacation enjoyable. But you don't care.", "Don\u2019t pay to keep the peace, you don\u2019t know this person and how they will fit in the family dynamics. Honestly I wouldn\u2019t allow them to come even if they were paying themselves. A vacation is for relaxation not an introduction to a new bf/gf\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA. I thought you were going to say you were trying to charge him a percentage of lodging/ accommodations or even activities and entertainment. As it is, you're being generous including his flavor of the month in the party. A plane ticket can't be that much. Tell your son if it's that important that he comes, your son can pay for the ticket.\n\nAnd if he takes you up on it, don't worry about the pictures. Honestly y'all could make it into a family joke. Make up crazy stories about who he was to tell each other while looking back through them. \ud83e\udd23", "NTA.\n\nHas your son got an actual friend you know that you could offer to pay for instead?", "NTA it is your vacation. You are allowed to have say in the guest list, especially if you are the one funding the event. You don\u2019t want a person you never met coming on the vacation. You son can opt to stay home if he does not like it.", "Make the temporary person take the pictures, or stand on the end of every picture, so they can be cropped out.", "NTA, I wouldn\u2019t be paying for his flavour of the week to come to a family gathering either. Sexuality doesn\u2019t come into it, it\u2019s a family event and they\u2019ve only been together for 5 minutes.", "Have him take all the family pictures. Problem solved and NTA", "Again, I\u2019m going to jump on a top comment to just say, fucking pay for the kid. It has nothing to do with homophobia or whatever. You can afford $22k for a fucking houseboat vacation. You want to have the best time of your life. Let your son do the same thing. The cost of flying his new boyfriend is insignificant to you, or you wouldn\u2019t be spending so much money in the first place. Just let everyone have a good time. You want to cause struggles in your family relationships to save what? 2% of what you were fine with blowing anyway? Just let everyone enjoy themselves. Wealth inequality is a nightmare. We\u2019re supposed to feel bad for you because you\u2019re worried about spending a little extra over what would be our years rent? Fuck off. You\u2019re all assholes.", "\u201cThat\u2019s my purse! I don\u2019t know you!\u201d", "Haven't seen anyone else mention this yet... It can be a very unfortunate dynamic when everyone else is in their little couple pods and you're awkwardly sitting alone, even if you know everyone. Would OP at least consider letting the son bring a friend?", "Sister is married to a woman for two years so not all CIS SO\u2019s.", "Except OP says his boyfriend can come, he just isn't going to pay for the flight which sounds very reasonable.", "She said she didn't want to come.", "You sound dumb as fuck\u2026 respectfully of course. You\u2019re saying he\u2019s an asshole for not paying for a complete stranger, who is still even seemingly new to the sons life. Thats just ignorant entitled thinking, and that\u2019s the mindset this AH son has too. So obviously your being bias because idiots stick together.", "Fly a complete stranger out to an important family celebration?\n\nGiven the sons history there is a good chance he will break up with his boyfriend soon after the party, why would Op spend the money, and have a stranger at an important event when the chances are they won\u2019t be at any others", "Also why would the boyfriend want to be stuck on a house boat with a bunch of complete strangers celebrating big family milestones? Awkward turtle.", "Weeded out, huh. That sounds sinister.", "\\*pocketsand\\*", "This lipstick tastes like turtles", "He probably thinks OPs family is loaded and he\u2019s about to be in the new season of White Lotus", "These straights, they're trying to murder me."]}
