If you must attend offsite work meetings or must carpool with co-workers specifically because of your position, you're covered by work insurance. Let's say, as an example, you're a manager of a location in a larger corporation, but there's a meeting two towns over and you have to take yourself and a co-worker as part of your specified manager duties. That's covered by work, even in your personal vehicle. \n\nHowever, if you're a driver of a non-company vehicle, let's say pizza delivery, UberEats, something of that nature, you need specialized insurance. If there's an incident and they discover you're using a personal vehicle for delivery work, they won't pay out. \n\nObviously, work vehicles are covered by work insurance but they *can* still deny you if you're using it out-of-bounds or in a way you shouldn't be. For example, if you work Monday through Friday but you get into an accident on a Saturday during a grocery run. The logic being, of course, that if you hadn't taken it where you shouldn't be, then no incident could occur - you are basically at fault and liable for your own expenses and repair costs at that point (this is slightly dependent on circumstances but outside specific conditions this remains true). \n\nIf you aren't required by work to drive anywhere and you are 'volunteering' then no, that's not covered. Things get murky at that point - he said, she said, they said. Did you offer or were you told? Kind of thing. \n\nTake all this with a grain of salt - it's how I understand it as someone who's had such a position as it being in my job description, as well as driving a company vehicle, and looking into personal vehicle use in a business setting.

I was like gtfo lol thankfully everyone at work knows he gross so no problems there", "Please do explain", "But it wasn\u2019t the result of an inevitable problem - if OP had been able to leave their windows open everything would have turned out fine.", "sorry if my comment wasn\u2019t clear- it\u2019s esh because OP should not offer a ride (unpaid) to someone they have a issue with. \n\nit\u2019s absolutely fine they let the coworker out of the car when asked. but they didn\u2019t need to accept the ask for a ride, or be rude about their smell. we have no idea if this person has health issues. even if they didn\u2019t- op shouldn\u2019t agree to drive anyone home off the clock that they don\u2019t want to. \n\ni was referring to \n\n1) accepting the unpaid labor to drive a coworker home that they already have issues with \n2) being extremely rude about coworkers smell- and comparing their smell to actual shit \n3) op not being kind \n\nto me an asshole is someone who fails to have empathy and is selfish- makes personal attacks- etc. op is AH.", "This is the answer. OP should tell their boss this.", "https://www.apa.org/monitor/apr01/blindness", "By definition, this a hostile work environment.", "Sex worker here. I could horrify, astonish and completely gross you out with some of the tales we could tell about our clients hygiene or lack thereof. \n\nThe number of men who truly believe wiping their ass *is gay* is staggering. The amount of clients who\u2019ve arrived with dinner plate sized sweat stains under the armpits of their business shirts is overwhelming - and insist they don\u2019t need to shower. \n\nThe volume of men who have unbelievably bad breath. \u201cThere\u2019s Listerine in the bathroom!\u201d you call after them politely as they go to wash their hands. A quick check shows they didn\u2019t bother. \n\nSigh. Time to pull out the big guns. \u201cHey, going swish real quick here, (holds out travel sized said Listerine) care to join me?\u201d *Big smile.*\n\nClient: \u201cI\u2019m good, thanks.\u201d\n\nMe: steely eyed. \u201cReally, *I insist.*\u201d\n\nThey get the message. \n\nSo yeah, not surprising at all this happens in corporate America because they sure as hell come to see us, lol.", "I work in developmental services. My job is in a group home with people with developmental disabilities. One of the individuals stopped bathing (which is his right, there's this whole thing now about respecting their rights even without considering harm reduction). He would bathe occasionally when he stayed overnight at his mother's house and that was only on holidays and long weekends. \n\nWe're worried about skin integrity, and frankly he was smelling bad. He's a smoker too. We had to apply foot cream twice daily. Not only was he not bathing, but he wasn't changing clothes very often unless pushed, and especially when mom would insist he change. He also wore his shoes and socks over 12 hours a day because he just kept his shoes on instead of taking them off after going out for each smoke. The application of the foot cream was not fun. And don't get me started on his teeth. \n\nWe tried to get it into his behaviour management plan, even mom was on board for that, but he balked. Finally, his work/day program started calling the house to complain about the hygiene issues. So, that's when staff from both places had a sit down with him. His work supervisor laid it out that if he was not going to clean himself and change clothes that he would be suspended from work. It was explained that if he has the goal of getting a real job, a real job would not hire him if he showed up like he was to an interview. And the consequence of suspension would happen at a real job. \n\nHe was 100% doing all of this out of laziness. Especially the clothes thing cause he wouldn't have to do laundry. On his laundry day he'd say, don't have any when asked if he was doing his laundry and wanted help bringing it down. It wasn't like he was never taking the clothes off. He didn't sleep with them on. And then just put the same ones back on. \n\nSo, if the expectation was for this guy to reach a standard of hygiene in order to go to work, then yeah, HR should be doing something about the guy in the post not sustaining a certain level of good hygiene.", "its ok. Soon he wont have any teeth to brush anymore.", "The boss shouldn't have asked OP to be the driver unless they were getting paid for it. Also, if one employee's hygiene is causing such an issue, it comes down to them doing their job & handling it. Not another employee that will get yelled at for doing what management should've done in the first place. It's almost like OP is the sacrificial lamb in some manner because it isn't likely that this person's hygiene isnt bothering anyone else- & instead of the upper crust doing their part, they let someone else do it who is expendable so they could spare their own feelings in telling another to take proper care of themselves.\n\nOP could've worded things in a non-confrontational manner- the fact that they aren't fond of their coworker is apparent. \"It's the sweet scent of cow shit!\" is generally what we say around here & although heavily sarcastic, it would've been a lot better than essentially telling the passenger that the cow smell was preferable. Yes, the passenger would've remarked back to close the windows once again, & all OP had to do was simply say \"Sorry, I prefer them open\". If you're on company time, why say something like that at all when it's very obviously a situation that's going to put you in hot water????\n\nThe guy that smells clearly has zero ideas that he smells like a moist anus, but again, on company time- let the company handle it. Why put your position at risk unless you have the financial capability to do so? I used to work with a girl who had what sounds to be similar hygiene habits or a lack therefore of. You could see the layers of plaque on her teeth, her hair was so greasy that if you took a hot comb to it & placed a container under it you could collect the drippings. Her scent as a whole was just abhorrent & her personality was abrasive- but idk her living situation, her mental health status, or any other things that would be going on in her life for her to reach a point where she accepted living like that, nor did I care enough to know. I disliked her & the tension was apparent at times, but at the end of the day I wasn't willing to risk my job to tell her about the magical splendors of warm water, soap, a rough scrubie, & what those things all do together. Management did that.", "Thanks for the explanation, I have my disagreements but I\u2019ll settle.", "It's not perfect I know, I didn't really touch base on the passenger acting out of hand. I just can't help but think that everyone involved could've taken different steps, & the situation all around seems stupid.\n\nBut OP isn't fully the asshole, & that's what's important here", "This is a stolen comment, from lower in the thread. Downvote and report bot", "Exactly, was he going to get reimbursed for mileage?", "\u201cWhat am I, hard of smelling? Of course I smell that!\u201d", "That's got to be one of the best lines in the entire series."]}
