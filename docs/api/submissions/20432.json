A **massive** dairy farm with *thousands* of cattle with a cesspool full of cow piss and shit is one of the most **foul** things to drive by. Depending on how the wind blows, you can smell it from pretty far away, too. It's even worse in the high heat of summer. \n\nNeedless to say... the two things are ***not*** comparable. \n\nIn my experience it's better to roll *down* the windows when you're passing the big dairies though, because if it's up, the smell can get trapped in your far and the wind (assuming its backroads or maybe a highway) helps 'move' it around to be a little less brutal, unless you're unlucky enough to have to come to stop near it.", "Feed lots smell terrible, my wife and I drove past a massive feed lot in Northern Cali and were gagging for miles.

Most farm, even the massive ones, tend to only be a few seconds of passing by time before you stop smelling its smell", "The diet they feed dairy cattle while they are producing milk isn't great for their gut flora, it has to be high in simpler sugars rather than fiber in order to support the overproduction of milk that modern dairy cattle are bred for.  This can cause them to have a lot of diarrhea.  When they aren't producing, they put them out to pasture so they can get a proper diet of mainly fiber and let their rumen and intestinal flora recover.", "My boss has called him out multiple times for this.
