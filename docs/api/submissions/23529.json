My grandma lives in the UK  but is 4 hours away meaning I don\u2019t get to see her often. I have two younger cousins Joe(M11) and Fay(F9) who live 10 mins walk from my grandma and grandads. Despite what my grandma says, they are her favourite.\nAnyway we plan the family holiday about 2 years prior. My aunt, Emma, is always very picky about where we go. She refuses everyone\u2019s ideas and always has an excuse if it\u2019s either too expensive, her kids won\u2019t enjoy it, she won\u2019t enjoy it ect. \n\nWell this holiday she again wanted to go to Disney world However the idea of a theme park isn\u2019t an ideal holiday for majority of my family (we\u2019re all tall) and so most rides are uncomfortable, but America is a no anyway since we have a lot of family live there and they want to go abroad and also because of the drinking age we worked out only 4 of my 10 cousins who are now 18+ could drink. \nWhen this point was raised Emma laughed and said \u201cwhy would you need to drink? We need someone to look after the kids when we go out drinking\u201d\nI asked if she was serious as she knows we enjoy going out and she said, \u201cwell it\u2019s my holiday too, I deserve a break from my kids.\u201d \nWe argued a lot and so did my other cousins and of course my grandma sided with Emma as she claims it\u2019s her kids (joe & Fay) dream to go but she normally can\u2019t afford it.\n\nWell my grandad put a stop to the arguing and said we would go to Germany as this is where we was planning to go before Orlando.\n\n About 6 months ago payments were due .

I\u2019m sure you understand\n\nThat was it for me and my cousins as Emma is making everyone else pay for her kids despite my grandma paying for half but she\u2019s also dumping her kids on everyone else so We decided to book a holiday to Ibiza with just us older cousins. \n\nWhen I was on the phone to my grandad the other day he was telling me how Emma is upset she doesn\u2019t have anyone to look after Joe and Fay and is now asking him to do it.

Have a wonderful time here in Spain, but I warn you, it is HOT and HUMID.", "NTA. You did good. You did SO good. You are NOT free babysitters while others enjoy their vacations - and for you to cut out like that? Beautiful. I respect you!", "NTA you know it's stressful when even grandpa wants to leave. It's her kids and she should look after them unless of course someone offers to look after them and it's a holiday why should you NOT drink like come on it's like mostly adults and as much as Disney world is awesome not every adult is going to enjoy it and I'm sure in Germany there's something for everyone to do and Emma was just asking for too much like it's not all about you and your kids which it's not the kids fault of course just their mother.", "You invited grandpa to Ibiza with you? Chef's kiss! That is outstanding!\n\nEmma is entitled to say the least. She wanted to pick the vacation, have everyone else pay for it, dictate the sleeping arrangement, and then unload the kids on everyone else. There's your AH in the story.\n\nNTA. Enjoy Ibiza, send pics of you and grandpa having a blast to Emma.", "NTA. The fact that your Grandpa also bailed should show them something. Grandma can have a great time watching the kids while Emma has a vacation.", "NTA, sounds like your Aunt is a bit egocentric. She having a bit free time from her kids is understandable but it sounds like, especially since your grandpa basically confirmed it, she wants babysitters who, since you were to pay same share and not per person share, pay for the \"privilege\" to babysit. \nYou\u2019ve got a cool grandpa though.", "NTA, Ibiza is awesome.", "NTA!!! I hope you and your cousins AND your grandpa enjoy Ibiza. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 And tell Grandma same thing will ALWAYS happen whenever E tries to pawn her responsibility onto someone else.", "NTA. Not the best for her to try to plan a trip that the majority wouldn't enjoy. Seems like she was only looking to benefit her kids that she seems too bothered to take care of anyways. She's basically ruining what's supposed to be a fun family trip.\n\nScrew her. And hell yeah to the older cousins' trip + grandpa! Have fun in Ibiza!", "NTA\n\nI would not agree to any more group vacations with your family. It sounds like you have outgrown this.", " NTA. It seems like your aunt\u2019s idea of a holiday is someone else watching her kids.", "You are NOT responsible for someone else\u2019s children! Definitely NTA. \n\nThis irks me to no end; people assuming younger family members will become full time babysitters during vacations.\n\nAbsolutely not.", "NTA, I hope you all enjoy Ibiza with your Grandpa!  I cannot stand it when someone like Emma decides that only she deserves to have a vacation, and the younger folks who are also paying for their own vacation, should shut up and babysit. \n\nGood on you and your cousins (and grandpa) for switching it up to suit you all better!", "NTA. Everyone is entitled to enjoy the family holiday, not just your aunt. Her demanding everyone cater to her wants and needs above all else is what ruined the holiday.  You and your older cousins enjoy hanging with grandpa.", "NTA. Nicely played!\n\nEmma no longer gets to step all over everyone. Emma no longer gets to dragoon y'all as babysitters. Emma no longer gets others to pay for her kids.\n\nY'all get to have a nice vacation, the way you deserve.\n\nEnjoy Ibiza!", "Well, we used to go to group vacations with friends with kids. And we did split costs dividing it between working adults, so family of 5 with SAHM and 3 kids paid the same as 1 single employed person. The difference is - we all agreed to do so to allow all our friends to come with us or some of us wouldn't afford it. We also took turns watching kids - with prior voluntary agreement too. What your family planned to do is unfair, so it's so logical outcome to get away from it.\n\nNTA.", "That\u2019s awesome that you stole your grandad from them.

But after reading your post I changed my mind and my vote. I think it\u2019s great that you, your cousins and granddad are going on the trip you want and not the one Emma is demanding and grandma is caving into. \n\nTell grandma and Emma that if they want you all to go where Emma wants there are some ground rules: they pay for everything, there\u2019s no dictating that a small child pushes an adult out of a bed and absolutely positively NO BABYSITTING. If they can\u2019t agree to your stipulations then no trip with Emma and her kids. \n\nNTA", "Bet those agreeing with them.

Nor us it appropriate for you to be forced to share w a child.\n\nGood for grandpa coming to Ibiza instead of babysitting!", "NTA. Let grandma watch her young grandkids. I hope you have a great time with your grandpa and cousins!", "You didn't ruin their holiday,  you just thwarted their attempt to ruin yours. They didn't want family time, they wanted to get other people to pay their way and watch their kids. You are neither an ATM or a nanny. The fact that so many other members of your family wanted to bail on that holiday means you aren't the only one feeling unsatisfied with these family vacations. Have a great time with your cousins and gramps, good for him for calling out their bullshit.  I would keep auntie and grandma out of future vacation plans, they can find someone new to take advantage of. NTA", "ESH....it would be best if you disclosed your unhappiness with the cost arrangement and \"kid dumping\" before making your plans to Ibiza....the people who cannot afford the vacation want to freeload from family members without being open with all the family members who are contributing more.

Does it suck? Yea. Is that your problem? Definitely not. She literally tried to make you pay for a trip where you would be her live-in nanny for a week. WTF? And your grandma is no better.
