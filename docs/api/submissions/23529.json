My grandma lives in the UK  but is 4 hours away meaning I don\u2019t get to see her often. I have two younger cousins Joe(M11) and Fay(F9) who live 10 mins walk from my grandma and grandads. Despite what my grandma says, they are her favourite.\nAnyway we plan the family holiday about 2 years prior. My aunt, Emma, is always very picky about where we go. She refuses everyone\u2019s ideas and always has an excuse if it\u2019s either too expensive, her kids won\u2019t enjoy it, she won\u2019t enjoy it ect. \n\nWell this holiday she again wanted to go to Disney world However the idea of a theme park isn\u2019t an ideal holiday for majority of my family (we\u2019re all tall) and so most rides are uncomfortable, but America is a no anyway since we have a lot of family live there and they want to go abroad and also because of the drinking age we worked out only 4 of my 10 cousins who are now 18+ could drink. \nWhen this point was raised Emma laughed and said \u201cwhy would you need to drink? We need someone to look after the kids when we go out drinking\u201d\nI asked if she was serious as she knows we enjoy going out and she said, \u201cwell it\u2019s my holiday too, I deserve a break from my kids.\u201d \nWe argued a lot and so did my other cousins and of course my grandma sided with Emma as she claims it\u2019s her kids (joe & Fay) dream to go but she normally can\u2019t afford it.\n\nWell my grandad put a stop to the arguing and said we would go to Germany as this is where we was planning to go before Orlando.\n\n About 6 months ago payments were due . Me and my cousins are also have to pay but we\u2019re paying the same amount as people with kids and stuff, Well as it turned out Emma thaught it would be best if we all split the cost equally, as she\u2019s currently struggling financially and this would be the only way she could afford it. Then my grandma also released the list of hotel rooms and who was sharing. I was put with Fay in a single bed with couch bed. Emma then also replied to the message saying :\njust so you know Joe and Fay need to sleep in the bed as they both have issues sleeping otherwise. I\u2019m sure you understand\n\nThat was it for me and my cousins as Emma is making everyone else pay for her kids despite my grandma paying for half but she\u2019s also dumping her kids on everyone else so We decided to book a holiday to Ibiza with just us older cousins. \n\nWhen I was on the phone to my grandad the other day he was telling me how Emma is upset she doesn\u2019t have anyone to look after Joe and Fay and is now asking him to do it. He said no but knows he will end up anyway, Wich is why he asked if he could come Ibiza. I said I\u2019d course and so he told my grandma.\n\nWell my grandma amd Emma sending messages like how we\u2019ve ruined there holiday and we have also stole our grandad at first I didn\u2019t care but other people are messaging me now telling me how rude me and my cousins are\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1690762812, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15e131x/aita_for_ruining_my_familys_holiday/", "score": 292, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are NOT free babysitters while others enjoy their vacations - and for you to cut out like that? Beautiful. I respect you!", "NTA you know it's stressful when even grandpa wants to leave. It's her kids and she should look after them unless of course someone offers to look after them and it's a holiday why should you NOT drink like come on it's like mostly adults and as much as Disney world is awesome not every adult is going to enjoy it and I'm sure in Germany there's something for everyone to do and Emma was just asking for too much like it's not all about you and your kids which it's not the kids fault of course just their mother.", "You invited grandpa to Ibiza with you?

Grandma can have a great time watching the kids while Emma has a vacation.", "NTA, sounds like your Aunt is a bit egocentric. She having a bit free time from her kids is understandable but it sounds like, especially since your grandpa basically confirmed it, she wants babysitters who, since you were to pay same share and not per person share, pay for the \"privilege\" to babysit. \nYou\u2019ve got a cool grandpa though.", "NTA, Ibiza is awesome.", "NTA!!!
