Your daughter is trying to manipulate you. If this was purely about bathroom needs, she wouldn't have put them under her brother's bed.

I think an incident like this warrants something like that to figure out what is up.", "NTA except for any yelling.  As a special education teacher, I can tell you that I agree with giving consequences to your daughter.  Blocking her from her brothers room is appropriate, I am not sure about the grounding.  She might not see it as a consequence and a month is too long.  But the notion that she needs consequences is correct.", "So, you heard her say she didn't want to bother you with her needs, and she's been hiding the evidence is her brother's room, and your gut-reaction is to punish her instead of figuring out what the problem is?

Well, I believe she knew it was wrong, especially if it's a recent development and she's used the bathroom normally until now.   I hope she's in therapy though, so maybe you can try to figure out WHY she would think peeing in bottles and then hiding them in her brother's room instead of, using the toilet, was appropriate.", "NTA. This does seem like a much bigger issue though.", "YTA. Yeah, your daughter did something wrong, but she's a disabled 14 year old who immediately confessed. Why was your immediate response rage? Why are you focusing more on punishing her than figuring out what is going on? \n\nWhat you describe is an extremely alarming and confusing situation. Obviously a short post in an online forum can never be super detailed or contain every nuance, but this situation doesn't even make sense. Is your daughter reliant on you to use a bathroom? Does she regularly spend time in her brother's room without permission? What the fuck is going on? \n\nYou need to be prioritizing your children's health and safety, not your anger. Nowhere did you mention connecting with her doctor, therapist, or care team. Nowhere did you ask her WHY she felt this was necessary, or even where the idea to do this came from!! How are you so incurious about your daughter clearly being in serious distress?? \n\nBoth your children are unhappy with how you handled this problem, and I see no reason to believe your punishment will prevent something like this from happening again in the future. Talk to your daughter, apologize for how you handled your anger, and show her that she CAN depend on her father even in awkward, gross, or scary situations.", "The fact that her brother (the victim) thinks it\u2019s too harsh should tell you something.  You need to talk to her about why she made this choice. \n\n\nWhy does she think it would \u201cbother you\u201d to help her with the bathroom?  Are you unintentionally acting different now that she\u2019s older (possibly from awkwardness?)  She\u2019s also at the age where privacy is important.  Does she only have Dad and brother for help?  That must be awkward for a teenage girl.  Could she be embarrassed by needing bathroom help?  Also, could this be related in any way to her getting her period ?\n\nAnd yes, definitely a lock for his room.  He deserves that.

First off a month long punishment is way to long! A week or 2 maybe but a month?? That's insane! Second, did you even think to ask her what she meant when she said \"I didn't want to bother you with my bathroom needs\"? Clearly by her saying that there's something more serious going on that should be address by a professional!

Something else is going on here, either she isn't as \"functional\" as you think, or you've scared her from the bathroom for some reason, or she lied and was trying to hurt bro.

If it was actually her that went through ALL of that trouble, than she is not doing this as a prank on her brother as a normal sibling thing. There is a much bigger issue happening. This is her showing that she needs help and you're punishing her for it.

Yes it's unsanitary but honestly it could be much worse. Her doing that would tell me something in her care is being overlooked. Why does she need to pee in a bottle? That's what you should be asking yourself. Once she feels forced to do this, (and I'd guess for a female it's not that easy to pee in a bottle) what is she supposed to do with the bottle?

And she has a cognitive delay and clearly has something deeper going on that needs to be addressed by a profession.

But if she's not sitting down (using the toilet), girls/women can't pee standing up or it runs down your legs. \n\nThis is not true anyway, so it's moot.", "But did you make her feel bad for it? Did someone else tease her for it? Is there something that happened that would make her feel bad or ashamed about coming to you about it?", "I sort of hear you but if I was asked to clean over a smell, and could smell that, I'd have been looking specifically for it and to try and remove it. But then, I've never been a teenage boy so maybe I just don't have the perspective for that.", "ask her how she peed in a bottle without making a mess.  She may not be covering for him but something else is definitely going on here.", "I guess I misspoke a bit, I think *some* level of negative reinforcement is needed to set boundaries, such as timeouts/loss of certain privilege's temporarily/etc, that's why I suggested OP lessen the punishment and not get rid of it entirely. what I meant was that that level of negative reinforcement i.e. screaming at her, shaming her over the gross behavior, and the grounding her for a month, which feels like an eternity and completely unreasonable in kid time, is several steps too far and will just end up causing her to get better at hiding her behavior rather than feeling comfortable to discuss her issues", "Depends on what the bathroom needs are. It could be that she's having intrusive thoughts about something coming up and biting her tushy and not an inability to use it. It could be that she's scared to walk to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Bathroom needs is pretty vague and doesn't really describe if it's a physical or mental block.", "If it was a Gatorade bottle, those openings are almost the size of a urine collection jar from the doctor.  Not all bottles have tiny openings like a soda bottle.\n\ntagging u/GatorSweet", "I mea that isn't true at all. Like as a person who has those parts I can tell you I've peed standing up plenty of times without peeing down my leg. Just spread your legs and make sure you're pushing a nice hard stream. I've had to pee outside many times for camping and such and very rarely has it gone down my leg. And that was more due to user error than an inability too. \n\nI mean even if it's not true, your misinformation can still be readily passed around.", "Squat. People with vaginas can squat to piss in bottles.", "Ummmmm no? That's not how it works lol", "I was nice to her about it but she should have grown out of this stuff already she\u2019s 14 not 4", "I've got a really shitty sense of smell and taste. (I can't taste the difference between black coffee and a frappuccino, for example; my friends give me all sorts of shit for it.) Again, it might just be me, but I do fully believe the kid either half-assed cleaning his room or genuinely just did not notice. (Especially if he's the sort who has all tons of crap under his bed? I don't know if he is or not but I know a bunch of people who use under-the-bed as storage.)", "This isn't about popping a squat and peeing in the woods. This is about peeing not sitting down *while* aiming into a bottle.", "She's also autistic. Which can have things crop up that we don't necessarily plan for. The fact that you word it like that shows you're more focused on her physical age and not that she has a mental block that you and your son do not have. And that you went straight to punishment when she admitted she was having an issue rather than barring her from jer brothers room and asking about it shows you've created an environment where she can feel that from you\n\nEdit for errors", "Okay yeah, seeing another comment tha it appears you deleted where you feel comfortable using the r-word when someone suggests your daughter needs additional support shows how truly in denial you are. \n\n*Your daughter is autistic*. Her brain objectively functions differently than other people's. As an autistic adult I can say she will always need support in ways a neurotypical person does not. How comfortable and cavalier you used that word as well as this statement here shows you're trying to pretend like she's not autistic because she's \"high functioning\". But it's a spectrum. There's a reason the functioning phrasing is dying out and people are using categories of support needs. Maybe she has low support needs in a lot of other areas, but in this particular area she has high support needs. And as her father shouldn't you love her enough to want her to do better. Rather than punishing her without touching base with her and ensuring she will never come to you with any issue that may even be tangentially related to her autism again?", "Should have and have aren't always the same. Especially in the world of autism. Regression is a thing.", "people (and especially people with ASD) can sometimes go through something called regression where the revert back to older behaviours (like behaviours they would engage with as a young child). This is an indicator that something happened or is happening to trigger the regression. You need to get your daughter to a professional ASAP", "I doubt that. Considering your responses..", "I understand what it's about. I'm telling you that you're wrong. For example, if it's a Snapple bottle. That's a pretty wide mouth area dontcha think?"]}
