Does she regularly spend time in her brother's room without permission? What the fuck is going on? \n\nYou need to be prioritizing your children's health and safety, not your anger.

How are you so incurious about your daughter clearly being in serious distress?? \n\nBoth your children are unhappy with how you handled this problem, and I see no reason to believe your punishment will prevent something like this from happening again in the future.

Are you unintentionally acting different now that she\u2019s older (possibly from awkwardness?)  She\u2019s also at the age where privacy is important.  Does she only have Dad and brother for help?

First off a month long punishment is way to long! A week or 2 maybe but a month?? That's insane! Second, did you even think to ask her what she meant when she said \"I didn't want to bother you with my bathroom needs\"?

This is her showing that she needs help and you're punishing her for it.

That's what you should be asking yourself. Once she feels forced to do this, (and I'd guess for a female it's not that easy to pee in a bottle) what is she supposed to do with the bottle?

And she has a cognitive delay and clearly has something deeper going on that needs to be addressed by a profession. She still needs to be held accountable (as I said grounding for a week or 2 is more appropriate), but he also needs to come from a place of compassion rather than going straight to severe punishment. Punishing her for that long will only teach her to keep more things from her Dad because she'll be scared of getting in trouble again. Severe punishment like a month long grounding (especially with no indication of other helpful intervention for the behaviour) is not the appropriate response here", "Exactly!
