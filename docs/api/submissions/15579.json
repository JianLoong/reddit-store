Does she regularly spend time in her brother's room without permission? What the fuck is going on? \n\nYou need to be prioritizing your children's health and safety, not your anger.

This is her showing that she needs help and you're punishing her for it.

That's what you should be asking yourself. Once she feels forced to do this, (and I'd guess for a female it's not that easy to pee in a bottle) what is she supposed to do with the bottle?

And she has a cognitive delay and clearly has something deeper going on that needs to be addressed by a profession.

As someone who has had to do a similar thing to avoid a landlord from hell, this should tell you there are much larger issues going on with your daughter that instead of popping off and immediately grounding her, you should ask why first and honestly seek counseling.", "dude YTA. its sometimes even hard for me to pee in the cups that give you at the doctors office for urine analysis. something is definitely going on here and you\u2019re an ass for getting angry with her instead of trying to figure out the truth/reasoning.  \n\nalso id like to point out that there is no such thing as \u201chigh functioning\u201d. there are some people who need more accommodations and some people who need less. there are some people who have lots of symptoms and there are some people who dont. there are some people who mask very well and some how dont", "Unbelievable YTA. No way you used the R-word in a comment when someone suggested your daughter needed additional support. Ignorant and gross behavior on your part.", "Sadly, my mind goes to 'something traumatic happened to her in a bathroom' as a possible response. It still doesn't explain hiding them in her brother's room though. But maybe a good therapist could get the answer?", "also, this story was on this sub few months ago already..", "This is sort of embarrassing to admit, but here it goes. I have, at times, done the whole \"peeing in a container and hiding it\" thing. And not just as a child but as an adult as well. \n\nI am diagnosed with OCD & PTSD. for me, this was 100% a trauma response. I was afraid to go to the bathroom, for a couple of reasons: 1) I had traumas that had occurred in the bathroom when I was a small child and I didn't want to be in there because it was upsetting for me. 2) I was afraid of crossing paths with anyone in the house, or even being heard walking through the house. I didn't want people, anyone, to know that I was going to be in the bathroom. So I would pee in cups and jars I found and then hide them under my bed until it was late at night and I could sneak out and dump them. \n\nThis is not \"normal\" behavior. I don't want to sound the alarms or anything, but it would be wise (imo) to take her in to a professional that can help get to the bottom of this.", "As a woman, i sat here trying to figure out how she peed in bottles. I pee in cups for doctor offices and have a hard time managing that, let alone a bottle with a smaller gap", "This is 100% the son. He didn\u2019t want to get up to go to the bathroom when he is playing his video games. Not sure how he talked his sister into taking the blame.", "Idk what you're talking about dude but a woman can 100% pee in a bottle effectively. Literally seen it happen. Maybe some women's anatomy makes it easier than others, but.... 50% in and 50% out isn't a common experience lol", "Also.. not so easy to get the pee into a bottle if you have female peeing parts. First need to pee somewhere else, then pour it in to the bottle. Sure will be messy and I'm quite sure everyone would want to wash their hands after that so might as well go & pee in the toilet.", "Try spreading your legs wide without squatting much, bending forward, and aiming backward instead of down.  And pee like you mean it.  Way less mess\n\n**Far easier when wearing a skirt than pants", "See I could see my teenager doing something like this as a low support needs autistic teen. Why?  The bathroom is right between the master room and the toddlers room,   he's afraid of waking people up and needs a night light, but cannot go back to sleep if the lights too bright. I could see his brain thinking to go in a water bottle instead, stashing it somewhere with the intent to get rid of it, forgetting about it remembering it and restashing it somewhere else to avoid being fussed at, and to avoid the discussion of \"we have melatonin and these other relaxation sleepy feeling lotions/pillow sprays/dim colored night lights\" because serious discussion of natural functions causes him to shut down and walk away.", "My husband had an issue when we lived in the dorms where he would pee in bottles in his room instead of going to the communal bathroom down the hall. He said he didn\u2019t know why but the thought of going into the bathroom made him super anxious. We talked about it. I offered to start walking him to the bathroom if it would help which he accepted. I officially lived in my dorm on the floor below but unofficially I lived in his room. He said he hasn\u2019t really felt that way since so we figure it was the communal bathroom situation. But we figured it out. I was grossed out by it definitely. And I did admit that to him as gently as I could followed immediately by \u201chow can I help make this not a problem?\u201d I didn\u2019t scream at him. I tried to understand when he would have a setback and do it again", "Dude I have memories of peeing in closets as a little kid (on carpet--ughh!).  Many years later I read that this is a symptom of trauma, which 100% lines up with the household I was raised in.  It was a very impulsive behavior that I wasn't consciously thinking about, and it was always a weird thing to recall.", "Same. Plus I would get grounded and belittled if I was found to be awake at 9 pm (even at age 16). My father was horribly abusive and neglectful. He also wouldn\u2019t let me use pads because I \u201cused too many and was wasteful\u201d (heavy flow). So my great grandma used to sneak me some. But I couldn\u2019t throw them away where he could see them so I had a box I hid in my room behind my dresser. So many other things - hiding snack wrappers, water bottles (was told I needed to drink soda like the rest of them), period stained panties, etc\u2026 :(", "but you hid the bottles in your own room.  She was hiding them in her brother's room.   That crosses a line.", "Oh AITA and the projections they create lol", "Kinda beside the point, but wouldn't it be easier with a long container even with a narrow mouth because you can place it directly over the urethra? No aiming or squatting really necessary", "It's difficult to pee in a bottle when you have a vagina because of the location of your urethra. We don't have a built in nozzle for it with our equipment.", "Pee doesn\u2019t originate from the vagina but it still goes through the bottom portion of it. This is like saying puke doesn\u2019t come from your mouth.\n\nThe person you\u2019re replying to clearly was saying people that don\u2019t have penises (and instead have vaginas) would have an unbelievably hard time pissing into a bottle. It had nothing to do with where the pee comes from, only where it goes out.", "Does she have free access to a bathroom at night? The wording of what she said makes it sound like she doesn't.", "It's possible with a Gatorade bottle and very intricate knowledge of one's anatomy. I've done it before in emergency situations. They also make funnels that people with female anatomy can use to pee standing up (or funnel into a bottle). It's VERY unlikely that an autistic girl who apparently needs help using the bathroom knows how to pee in a bottle.\n\nMy thoughts are that the story is either made up, or if it's true, the son did it.", "I mean there are devices that could help her pee in a bottle. Like a sheewee. But even then, yeah that's a weird story.", "My ex told me she once pooped in a bottle as a young teen. I still can't get my head around how that's possible.", "Necessity, you just get used to it. I'm an archaeologist so regularly have to pee in the woods at work and squatting to pee is much better than either dehydrating yourself so you don't pee or holding it while doing physical work. My biggest stress is getting ticks on my butt while peeing so I always check that before pulling my pants back up.\n\nBut yeah, I can barely manage to pee in the cup at the doctors with access to a toilet, I don't think a bottle would be possible.", "Practice I guess lol. At our last trailer park I'd have to go out back because we would have to wait days to get pumped out. Thankfully our new one has a sewer system. I just spread my legs as far as I can, hold my pants away from me and pray no one can see me lol. I got some on my pants a lot growing up when I had to do this. My family only let me get away with begging to go anywhere with a bathroom once.", "I was introduced to the tidbit of leaning against a tree in basically a squat to keep your feet clean. It is the ONLY way I can dream of peeing outside", "Practice...I'm almost 38 and I thank my lucky stars that I started stretching regularly at age 16", "As an ND person I really appreciate you understanding your kids thought process. I think it shows your empathy & love and like maybe you asked him why instead of getting mad", "Here\u2019s the thing that makes me think this isn\u2019t real. Several posters have related their real life experiences of storing pee. Not one of them hid it in *someone else\u2019s* room. That\u2019s what makes me suspicious this isn\u2019t real and I never normally post that, as truth is stranger than fiction. In this case, peeing in someone else\u2019s room is really territorial and really ramps up the ick. If it\u2019s true. I don\u2019t think so though.", "But to put it in her brothers room? There is an element of getting caught.", "Your husband is fortunate to have someone as compassionate as you in his life. It's amazing how far people can get when they feel safe enough to be open and vulnerable.", "But she is also a kid with a disability. Kids constantly do shit that doesn't make sense to the rest of us. It's a problematic behavior for sure but it should still be addressed compassionately.", "I get your line of thinking. However, if a 14 yo girl knows exactly where her urethra is AND can urinate into a standard 16 oz bottle opening without squatting, she\u2019s a better woman than me! Not to be graphic, but when placing a catheter in a female you have to move aside other parts and sometimes have them bear down or cough so it \u201cwinks\u201d and you can find it.", "Dude, have you ever seen a person with a vagina's urethra? Nah, because its slightly inside the body and incredibly difficult to aim, much less for a girl who has bathroom troubles already. \n\nIt's the son. My brother did the exact same thing, he judt pissed in 2litres and when we moved he pretended he had no idea what they were. When i threatened to tell our mom he said he was just too lazy to go upstairs. \n\nNot to mention peeing in a bottle would be incrediblt difficult. She'd be pissing on herself and the floor. If she's doing this, she isnt doing it in her room so that leaves the bathroom and the brothers room. It doesnt work whichever way you look at it.", "Nobody pees out of their vagina, and it is seriously not that hard. I don't get all these comments about how horribly difficult this is... Literally seen women do this exact same thing no fuss, in the front seat of a car in traffic.", "It sprays everywhere. Source, my patients who provide urine samples with pee on the outside of the cup every damn time.", "It's still very difficult to line up the bottle, especially if she needs help in the bathroom.", "It doesn\u2019t spray everywhere because we sit on the toilet so it sprays everywhere inside the toilet. It\u2019s a separate hole doesn\u2019t mean the the hole in in another planet by itself for precise aim. When we pee squatting before a steady stream the pee comes in contact with other parts of the vagina, the clit the lips etc so it sprays everywhere and difficult to aim in a bottle. Hope this helps", "It's crazy how much you're getting downvoted. I can also pee into a bottle pretty neatly just by lining it up, the key is to hold it tightly against your skin so the pee can't really run elsewhere. Obviously everyone's anatomy is different but it's absolutely possible for at least some of us.", "For some reason your comment reminded me of the story my aunt tells about popping a squat with her cousin while riding four wheelers and my aunt looked over and saw that her cousin was squatting RIGHT over/in poison ivy \ud83d\ude02 (and yes I know that my family is weirdly close)", "Ladies/people with vaginas: use a wide mouth jar.  Bottles don't work.  \n\nNot trying to be gross, but being able to tidily pee in a container is actually a good emergency skill to have.", "I honestly don't know how it's possible, but apparently it can be done. I used to work with a woman who claimed she could do this. She had a small bladder (and a medical condition I believe, can't remember), so when she had to go, she had to go. She told me most days in high school she couldn't even make it from the end of her driveway to her house and hide in a bush to pee in a bottle. Personally, I would've passed on the bottle, I don't know why she thought that was better than just going on the ground behind some cover.", "Cis female and I've done it a few times without any trouble. Got to get as close to the bottle as possible.", "You just need to know where your urethra is, and it\u2019s pretty easy. Put wide mouthed bottle around urethra, leave a little gap somewhere for air to escape, let rip. I got so good at it I could put the bottle in the leg of loose pants and pee without exposing myself.", "It's not that hard. Known multiple women to do it.", "Omg \ud83d\ude02 I pulled my pants down to my ankles and directed my pelvis toward the ground. I didn\u2019t \u201cspill\u201d a drop but I was petrified of getting caught.", "In general, I agree with you - my sister (not autistic but other neurodivergent stuff and as far as I know she never hid bottles of piss in my room) would stash stuff of hers in my room as a way of marking her territory so to speak.\n\nHowever, in this instance, I can also see the thought process being 'Problem: bathroom issues and don't wanna use the bathroom at night. Solution: pee in a bottle... Problem: what if someone finds them and I have to have to a difficult and uncomfortable conversation and/or punishment? Solution: Hide them somewhere else.\"", "I was disgusted by the bottles of pee, not by him. Whereas he was more disgusted with himself than the actual bottles. We made a plan of me walking him down the hall to go dump them in the toilet and toss the bottle in the large bathroom trash that was taken out daily. Yelling won\u2019t solve anything.

How do you think she got the pee into the bottles????\n\nYTA. And possibly need a book on anatomy.", "This is 100% your son. He doesn\u2019t want to get up to go to the bathroom when he\u2019s playing video games. Your daughter is taking the hit.", "Part of me assumes that most people have interactions of trying to catch urine mid stream, depending in the type of bottle it would be easy enough to press right up against the source.", "You're also trying to have them catch a mid stream sample of urine. If we take something like a standard litre pop bottle and press it straight up to the urethra opening, it wouldn't be as hard to catch it all.", "Well, as a person who had chronic UTIs growing up, I learned to aim into things.", ">I'm aware of the urethra, thanks. But if she's not sitting down (using the toilet), girls/women can't pee standing up or it runs down your legs.\n\nWell, typically, it would be done squatting. I guess you could technically do it standing but it would be more difficult.", "I know how it works. I too have those parts.  And what I'm saying is that it is possible. I'm not saying it was perfect. I'm not saying it was easy. But I'm saying that saying it is physically impossible for a person with a vagina to pee into a bottle is completely untrue. Another commentator is saying literally that people with vaginas can't pee standing up at all or it will go down their legs. As a person who has just lifted a skirt and spread them out in the woods. I can say that that is not true. Also, as a person who has to pee like a dozen times a day because I have a person sitting on my bladder, I can say that it doesn't spray everywhere every single time. Most of my pees now are actually a steady heavy stream because my bladder is full nearly every time I go to the bathroom. Now would it be easy for me to pee in a bottle? Probably not. But I am saying that is not physically impossible like a ton of people are suggesting.  \n\nIf that's how your pee works okay! That's in your experience. I'm just saying that saying that it is physically impossible. It's blatantly untrue. And saying that a person with a vagina can't pee standing up or else it'll go down their legs is also not true. I don't need you explaining how my pee works to me.
