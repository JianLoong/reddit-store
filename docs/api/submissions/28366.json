Our parents divorced when we were 7. Our dad married our step mother and Ashley is my dad and step mothers daughter. Ashley is technically my 1/2 sister but she is my best friend and I love her more than anything. Keith and I have never been close despite having the same parents.  \n\nMy dad bought his house with my step mother when I was 18 and Keith was 16. I have no sentimental attachment to the house since I didn\u2019t live in it long and my sister lived there her whole life. My brother was never really close to our dad and always said he disliked our dad. \n\nMy step mother passed away a few years ago. Our father passed away this year from cancer. Ashley and I helped take care of him so Keith already knew his portion of the estate would be much less. Our father left Keith 10% of the estate, me 45%, and Ashley 45%. \n\nAshley is still in college. Keith is working and traveling. I am happily married to my husband and we are not struggling by any means. \n\nMy husband and I talked and told Ashley we\u2019d make our guest bedroom into a room for her so she always has somewhere to come home to during college breaks. And my husband told me he promised my father we\u2019d pay for the remainder of Ashley being in school as long as she has good grades. (My father paid for Keith and I to go to college and had the same plans for Ashley) \n\nMy husband and I also decided that we don\u2019t need the money from my fathers estate so my portion could go to Ashley for her to have some money when college ended. She could also decide to keep the house and live there (my husband said we could buy out my brothers 10% if she couldn\u2019t). \n\nKeith found out about this and has completely flipped out. He doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s fair we\u2019re giving this much to Ashley. He\u2019s told our mother how I\u2019m a monster of a sister and don\u2019t care about him. My mother has taken his side and said I\u2019m favoring Ashley and could have divided it between her and Keith. Ashley is 22 and Keith is 34. They\u2019re at different parts of their life and Keith and I still have at least one parent. \n\nI\u2019m getting texts from family and friends that Keith has told saying how awful I\u2019m being to him.

It's good of you to help Ashley in place of her (and your) father, and you are fortunate to be in position to do so.\n\nKeith is no worse off now than he was before you decided to give your share of the inheritance to Ashley, so all this is from him is sour grapes.", "NTA.

Your brother did not get along with your dad and your dad had his reasons for giving him a 10% share.  People get disinherited all the time.

Sometimes the relative thinks someone else in the family needs more help.   \n\nEven if we all think you are NTA and your heart is in the right place, what you are doing might not be 100% legal.

Your brother/family and friends are being awful, but that\u2019s what you get with family and finances.  For them to think they are in any way entitled to a say in what you do with your money is ridiculous, yet not unexpected.  One suggestion, though, is to hold onto the money for a little while.  First, it might shut them up about you giving it away.  Second, Ashley is already getting what I\u2019m assuming is a good bit of money with her 45%.  A lot of us would have blown through a windfall like that at her age.  So throw it in a high yield savings account (or possibly a trust, depending on the amount), and give it to her at a future time of your choosing.
