Your dad didn't owe any specific inheritance to any of you three children; what he gave was the gifts he wanted to give you. Now what you have is yours to do with as you please.

Your father clearly saw how you would care for her after and provided accordingly. \n\nIf your brother owns 10% of the house, he might not be willing to have it bought out because he sounds like an arse. I would definitely say that I wouldn't gift your portion to your sister, though, if only to make sure there is a third party decision maker on a property (I am sure your sister is very capable, but handing her a total of 90% on a house with a dick of a 10% owner could get very stressful - having you as a named owner/beneficiary will help to back her up if things get messy). Also, check with a lawyer about the best way to gift your money/college fund as I understand there will likely be taxes. In the UK, you could open a joint bank account with her to allow her to use the funds (and you can also gift a small amount to family members each year), but I'm not sure how it works in the US. \n\nYou're an absolutely stand up sister. And your husband is clearly very supportive and generous, also. While all this means your mum might take Keith's side when it comes to dividing her inheritance, I think you seem the type to value your relationships and happiness over money so it feels like that isn't going to be such an issue. I wish you all the very best of luck and joy moving on.", "How the heck does he even know?", "NTA\n\nI might add it sounds like quite a bit of the money came from Ashley's mother in the first place.
