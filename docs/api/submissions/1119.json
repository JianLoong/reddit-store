At the same time, this is the rule you and your fiance decided and that should be respected, since it's actually not hurting anyone. You mentioned it's partly due to financial reasons, so if anyone asks for a +1 they'll be willing to pay for a plate as well? I'm sure if you asked for money for their +1, they'd be going off.\n\nNo one can demand who the bride and groom invite, unless they're paying for the wedding, even then that should be discussed before handing the money over.", "YTA for deliberately excluding from your post how long they've been together.\n\nIf they've only been dating for a few months then I'd understand but if it's several years and they just don't want to get married then that's a slap in the face.", "This post feels related to another post I saw recently. Wonder of it the other sisters point of view.", "YTA. Of course it's your wedding your rules, but that doesn't mean you're not an A H for disrespecting long-term relationships because they don't have what, the \"sanctity\" of marriage? And is your bias really worth burning the relationship with your sister too? (of course family in the wedding party would reasonably be allowed different \"rules\") \n\nYour fear that people who have been dating for just a week might want to come together to your wedding is f-ing bizarre.", "YTA. It's perfectly reasonable to allow immediate family or bridal party a +1 regardless of their relationship status and regardless of the allowances for other guests. If you really wanted to keep the list trim then you should've given your sister and any other bridal party members a heads up and not let them find this out via mail. I would never think, \"Omg why did the bride's sister get to bring her BF and I didn't?!?\"\n\nETA: It's also not really inviting a \"+1\" for a married or engaged couple. Married couples are obviously a package deal and it would be bizarre to invite only one half of a married couple. Did you really send an invite addressed to one person's name with a \"+1\" or did you address it to Mr. and Mrs. SoAndSo?", "YTA she\u2019s going to drop serious money as your MOH and can\u2019t even bring her bf?", "YTA what a absolutely ridiculous rule to have. Its the 21st century not all couples are married or are planning to marry.

But mainly YTA for leaving out how long they\u2019ve been dating. I have a feeling it\u2019s not a month", "YTA.\n\nThis is really nothing other than ranking people\u2019s relationships and judging them. Get over yourself: the fact that you chose marriage doesn\u2019t make you better than people who didn\u2019t.\n\nThis is your sister. She is in a committed relationship with someone she loves. You chose to use a technicality to avoid honoring her relationship with her bf and to ensure tension in her relationship with you.\n\nIf I were her, I would skip your wedding and reconsider having a relationship with a sister who weaponizes her smug, righteous sense of superiority against me.", "INFO\n\nhow long has she been dating her boyfriend?\n\nI have always thought it was odd that people don't invite SO's to a wedding if they're not engaged or married as if that really matters. Why are weddings only for engaged or married people? So strange and elitist.", "YTA. Your standards suck.", "Other guests might ask, but she\u2019s your sister so I don\u2019t think they would argue when you explained she\u2019s the exception.  But I think it\u2019s important to know how long sister has been with her boyfriend.  I\u2019m gonna go with YTA, because I think it\u2019s likely if they had only been dating a month that you would have used that argument, so my guess is this is a long term relationship.", "You could directly invite the boyfriend, and then he wouldn't be a +1, he would be an invitee. (BTW, this is what you should have done for married couples as well. You invite both. You don't invite one person +1 for a married couple.)  It sounds like you don't like either your sister or her boyfriend. Kinda YTA.", "YTA for getting angry about the consequences of your choice. She won\u2019t be the only one so buckle up.", "We all know you intentionally left out how long they've been together so YTA", "It's your wedding, your rules, but you also decided to leave out long/how serious the relationship is. I'm going with YTA because you know it would be an issue and she might drop out so you can save a couple bucks. Only you can decide if you're sister not coming at all was worth it, but if guess not.", "YTA your sister likely will spend alot of money on your wedding as a bridesmaid. You should give her a plus one. It\u2019s a ridiculous rule to have. Not all couples end up in marriage. You are not respecting her relationship by excluding her boyfriend.", "INFO...do you know this boyfriend well? If there was an exception to be made, this would be the one. The consequences are yours to enjoy.", "So what you\u2019re saying is a couple who had known each other and been married for 1 year *would* be invited\u2026 but a de facto couple of 20 years *wouldn\u2019t*. Yikes. Way to enforce your weird beliefs about marriage and the value of relationships on others.\n\nI dunno why you haven\u2019t included how long they\u2019ve been dating here, seems fairly key. \n\nIf he\u2019s a new partner of a few weeks/months *and you don\u2019t know him*, I\u2019d get it.
