You were justified since she was shaming someone else and making them cry. If she wasn't so mean and judgemental I'd say leave her to her hypocrisies, she's probably dealing with some internal conflict and has to put on a show for her family. But she loses any sympathy for how she treated your friend.", "I mean I think she deserves some empathy, because I am certain that there are underlying issues on her end (like my guess would be that shes putting on an act at church, and making herself feel better for her own transgressions against her parents). Were you an asshole? No of course not, but you knew that.\n\nNTA", "This sounds made up.", "NTA. One would think that coming from such a \"good\" family would make her a better person, hey?", "NTA. It would be one thing if she were just preaching restraint while not practicing it, but she lost her high ground when she began actively shaming someone else. She made her (sexy) bed, now everyone knows she lies in it.", "Good for you taking her off her holier than thou pedestal. NTA", "NTA, and she definitely is for her conduct, but show some empathy if you can. She\u2019s clearly struggling with some stuff if she\u2019s so harshly preaching a standard she doesn\u2019t herself maintain. You\u2019ve come to grips with church not being for you, but she\u2019s probably really torn between her very religious family and everything she\u2019s grown up knowing, and the world she actually sees  in front of her. Her lashing out is an exhibition of that inner battle.", "Im on the \u201cthis is bullshit\u201d train. Im 26, have a masters degree and have never used the term lambasts.", "NTA. As for others saying you need to leave that church, you are unfortunately going to find this kind of person, although it could be an adult. There are a lot of hypocrites that go to church. I'm glad you stood up for your friend.", "NTA.  I had a similar issue with a girl growing up in our high-demand religion.  She was sneaking out, skipping school, partying on weekends.  She would get busted by her high-and-mighty parents from time to time but still had the stones to try to shame the rest of us.    \n\n\nEventually, she got pregnant, dropped out of college and never married the father.  Plus she stayed in the church, so she's probably going to be dealing with enough shaming to last several lifetimes.", "That church is toxic, seriously get out of it, also extreme hypocrites deserve to be called out, NTA", "NTA. But your parents are and so is this disgusting pastors daughter.", "NTA. Thank you for being you.", "NTA. Next time she says this crap about people going to hell just say to her as matter of fact as you can \"so I guess we'll be seeing you there as well.\"\n\nCan't stand these religious nutjobs and their holier than thou attitude.", "Why are you part of that church? I have a feeling the rest of people aren't great either", "NTA but some devilish part of me thinks you should keep forcing the issue. Like ask for a public discussion in church, get a whole bunch of bible passages ready about hypocrisy and whatnot, and see if you can get the pastor\u2019s daughter to repent and publicly recommit to following a righteous path. If she truly believes all of the stuff she\u2019s been saying, then you would be doing her a favour. See if you can get her to swear on a stack of bibles that she\u2019s remained chaste while you\u2019re at it.", "Religion sure does seem great. Almost wish I had me some /s\n\nNTA", "NTA and I would tell my parents that her \u201cstruggles\u201d are directly causing others to struggle. It is impacting the church goers and causing a rift between people and their religions. Let them try to justify that. \nI\u2019m also agnostic and don\u2019t want to cause drama just for the sake of it, but sometimes people need to be shown this stuff. The pastors daughter needs to knock it off. People need to understand that someone\u2019s (pastors daughter) actions due in fact impact others. Why is she allowed to go around bullying others? Why is she \u201cjust struggling?\u201d Why is she allowed to cause others to struggle, cry, and whatever else? Why is she allowed to make people uncomfortable or even afraid to attend church?", "NTA.   What's that saying?  People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.   Well, she threw a big ole rock and got mad when the wall broke.   Oh well.", "NTA. Your parents are more worried about their reputation with the pastor. Which is total BS.", "NTA.", "is this like your weird fantasy that you tried out online?  YTA in more ways than one.  i doubt you are anywhere near brave enough to do what you claim you did.\n\nfyi, when you smoke weed, you don\u2019t have to see it to believe it.  the oder travels and it is very strong and tend to linger.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
