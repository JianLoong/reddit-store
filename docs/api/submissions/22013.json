(His grandmother told me she would have done the same)", "It's petty but NTA", "NTA, gf is not too important to be heating bread rolls.", "I think it is weird to ask someone to cook something for you randomly, when you\u2019re both working especially. To me \u201cthat\u2019s too much work\u201d could mean many things in the moment (too much work at the moment, she likes the rolls but finds them annoying to make, she\u2019s too busy to fuss with them right now, etc). You also don\u2019t say how she reacted to you not making her any. \n\nAnd I do think that\u2019s petty because it\u2019s presumably no additional effort to make enough for both (unless you actually wanted a whole pack which seems wild to me\u2014 how much bread are you eating at once?) and I think being intentionally petty is never good, especially if her only slight was telling you she didn\u2019t want to do a particular thing (doesn\u2019t really matter why). I think it\u2019s kind of rude to ask her to make them if she was working in the first place. (Saying you\u2019ll take some if someone decides to make them isn\u2019t the same, because it\u2019s not a request to do it and definitely not a demand.) \n\nSo I think YTA or maybe E S H if the issue is she never makes you things and you have built up resentment. (You mention you usually make these but not if she ever makes anything, does other stuff for you, etc.) But I think you opened a bad box of bees by expecting someone to drop what they were doing and make you rolls, and it doesn\u2019t sound like she usually has that expectation of you at all.\n\nEdit: you mention elsewhere you cook dinners together and that suggests she does cook sometimes, so it\u2019s pretty unreasonable to get upset and be petty someone won\u2019t jump and make you bread rolls.", "Ehhhh, ESH. You're in the right, but still petty. \n\nYou could and should have talked to her about it instead of being petulant, even if that talk happened after the work thing. Maybe she misspoke and actually meant she was too busy at that moment too? Maybe she's concerned that, since you always do it, she'll do it wrong and they wouldn't be as good? Maybe in her head this is one of your chores and it equals some other minor thing she 'usually' does so passing it to her is unreasonable? Maybe she didn't want them enough to get them so the effort was too low priority and thought you felt the same since you were deferring the task to her or later? Several possible reasons other than her being above it and you being seen as a lowly gluten-slave.\n\nTalk instead of pouting. Otherwise little things like this that literally do not matter become beating-sticks in bigger fights.", "INFO: Who cooked the rest of the meal?\n\nI'm leaning YTA for you only heating up enough for yourself since I'm sure it was only another 1% effort to slap a couple extra on the tray.  However, if she also cooked the rest of the meal, definitely YTA.", "Yeah, you definitely do not have a winner there,", "YTA. You were both working and neither of you were in a space where prepping the bread was a hassle-free experience. You got offended because she said she'd like some **IF** you made some, not when.

Clearly she is not one who likes to help out but likes to complain.  Do you want to be with this for the duration?", "We only had the bread rolls for breakfast, so I was the one fully preparing for the meal with her doing nothing. \n\nWe usually make dinners 50/50, with each one doing one every other day", "Soaking them?! Why are we soaking rolls?", "INFO: was there any other food options that require less work available like cereal as you said this was for breakfast?", "NAH. She couldn't be arsed; I don't think that makes her an AH. Sometimes I won't make a cup of tea because I can't be bothered but if someone offered me one I'd say 'oh yes please!'.

Did she work all day and is tired? Did she prepare the rest of the meal and she's not interested in doing yet another thing? \n\nNow that I think about it, I'm going with NAH mostly because this is so incredibly minor. \n\nI mean, be annoyed, that's your right, but the bread isn't the problem here.", "You're NTA for asking her to make something for you. She's NTA for telling you it was too much work, but if you make them to make her some too. YTA for making some and not making any for her. What kind of relationship do you want to have? The one where you only are generous and kind, if the other person gives first? In a successful relationship, both parties give 100% and are in a contest to see who can serve each other better. That's how I've stayed married for 22 years. You can do better. Show love, even when you're miffed, even when you're tired. It's bread, today, but the little things add up.", "YTA\n\nBeing petty and making them only for yourself is obnoxious as hell.\n\n There is shit you will always do and shit they will always do.

Are you often interrupting her work to ask her for things you are more than capable of doing yourself?\n\nAs you report it, you made a request, she politely declined but said if you were doing it anyway she would like some. On what planet is that rude? You interrupted her day and then got petty. YTA. Good grief.", "YTA. Do you often expect her to drop everything to fulfill your whims? If you want something, you get it for yourself. Not making some for her as a punishment makes you even more the AH.", "ESH - i know how it is when both work from home, just because one finished does not mean that the mind is not still in work mode. \n\nSo maybe she was feeling lazy, or maybe her day was full of stress. \n\ni do not know how you handle the role of cook, we alternate apart from when one wants to make something out of order. Or we discuss different food, because one wants something the other does not like. \n\none checks with the other, before making food. and yes the cooking times should be equal. You you cook today, she cooks tomorrow. Passive aggressive not feeding the other is very petty. that stuff builds up and spending so much non-quality time together is stressful in itself. actively arguing is better to clear the air.", "I'm going to say yes, YTA but only because I believe she probably does a lot of other things like washes your clothes, makes the bed, etc. and you are only expected to make bread rolls for her once in awhile. Obviously, I have no idea the situation and you could be doing more than your fair share of household chores but I'm going to go out on a limb and say what I think is really going on in this situation.", "YTA - despite what Reddit says because you are being petty.  And you know it.  It almost takes MORE effort to cook those rolls only for yourself.  Obviously, Reddit is the land of petty so you are among friends but still TA. \ud83d\ude02\n\nNow that it's out of your system, just talk to her.  For a lot of people, the thought of doing things that seem complicated is too overwhelming.  Maybe you guys can warm up some rolls together so she can see that it really isn't a big deal.

I have to wonder how many AITA responses come from happily married people.  My husband and I have this dynamic, but we both have things we do that the other person *could* do, but we are just used to doing certain tasks and it works out in the end.  I *could* take the garbage out  and when my husband is traveling, I do.  I don't generally do it though because he does.  At the same time, I usually cook dinner because I just do.  My husband and I both do grocery shopping and plenty of times one of us says, \"Are you going to Costco by any chance?  If you do can you get me XXX\".

It sounds a lot better IMO than just simply saying no, as it validates that the rolls are a good idea, but I just can\u2019t do them right now. Him demanding she do them when he wants them and she can live without them makes him an AH honestly.", "Or like... she just doesn't value them as much as he does. The juice is not worth the squeeze for her and it is for him and he's mad that when there's NO squeeze for her she will still eat them -- but it just sounds like this matters more to him than it does to her and that's not that big a deal?", "He says they were both working from home that day. Her actual words don\u2019t negate the fact that she was working that day. (Even if she wasn\u2019t and was having a lie in, that\u2019s still fine! People don\u2019t have to jump at OP\u2019s beck and call.) She\u2019s not saying she can never make the rolls because they\u2019re too difficult. As I mention, \u201ctoo much work\u201d can mean at the time. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine asking someone to make me food that I want, especially if we\u2019re both working from home! Seems very demanding. Of course if I\u2019m making something big enough to share that my husband also eats, I\u2019d ask if he wants some, but I\u2019d never say to make it for me!\n\nI\u2019m still curious if she even reacted to his pettiness. I\u2019m guessing if she did it was basically \u201cwell that\u2019s petty and crappy\u201d which is how most folks would feel at any intentionally petty act. It doesn\u2019t sound like she expected him to act at her beck and call and make stuff (she said she\u2019d have some if he made it, that\u2019s all, after he initiated the discussion).", "Gf was working too that's why he's the ah", "Didn't you say you both were working from home? So that would mean she was working and not doing nothing?", "OP told us her reaction to him asking if she would make them. He didn't tell us her reaction to him only making some for himself.", "You can do things during the waiting part tough. You don't have to stare in the oven all the time", "Asking your partner to do something she will also benefit from when you are the person who always takes the time to do that thing is not a ridiculous ask, especially if it only takes 10 minutes.  Really less than that. Just wet them and stick them in the oven, maybe 2 minutes. \n\nIt's not like she said she was busy too. She just didn't want to be bothered. Partnerships are supposed to work both ways.", "OP is \"ridiculous,\" but GF is not?", "But OP says he always makes them. So I don't see why she can't make them for a change?\n\nIt's like if one of you always makes dinner, it usually builds resentment. \n\nHe's clearly annoyed she doesn't make the effort to make lunch for him. Yet he does it for her often.", "Seriously, like \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to make anything myself because I don\u2019t have time or don\u2019t want it enough, but I\u2019ll have some if you happen to make a shareable food\u201d isn\u2019t the ridiculous take that OP wants it to be. He didn\u2019t have time to make his food and then got annoyed that she wouldn\u2019t do it for him. She didn\u2019t demand he do it either. It was like *if* you do, I\u2019m interested. He should be moderately annoyed at best. This is so petty.", "She was working from home. How is that being lazy?", "Considering the were both working from home, she was, presumably, working\u2026", "He said they were working from home. No one is saying she SAID that. They\u2019re saying it\u2019s the context of the scene\u2014 that\u2019s too much work for breakfast for the current time. Also who demands someone make them breakfast? (I know he asked but it\u2019s not really just asking if you get fussed at No for any reason.)", "Yeah, lol, these comments are standard \"man bad woman good\".\n\nOP literally gives the reason she stated, and people are ignoring it for the most uncharitable interpretation of him.  \n\nI wish I could say I was surprised, but this is AITA.", "her working does make it seem like she was busy \n \nAnd also,  no, I don't think it's entitled to say you don't want to make something but if someone makes the thing you'd eat some. She didn't ask him to make her rolls. She simply said she *would* eat a roll. \n \nI wouldn't make a fruit salad right now but I'd eat a fruit salad if someone made it. I also wouldn't ask someone to do that for me tbf.\n\nEdit: oops lol I did say she was busy.", "I don\u2019t see that as entitled at all. Putting myself in OP\u2019s shoes, I absolutely can\u2019t imagine asking someone to make me food, and pitching a fit if they say no for any reason. Honestly, she\u2019s not even required to even if she was off from work, although it would arguably be an AH move. To me, demanding someone do something like that for you is entitled. If I wanted some food and can\u2019t make it right then, I\u2019d figure out another option before demanding someone else do it.", ">difficult. As I mention, \u201ctoo much work\u201d can mean at the time. \n\n>I can\u2019t imagine asking someone to make me food that I want, especially\n\nFine, but for some people that's no problem. For us this is very normal to ask the other when we are either too busy or too tired. And sometimes we'll do something for the other, even when we're also tired. Because we know the other person only asks when they really can't. And if the person who is asked can't either, we communicate that and find a solution. That's how we take care of each other.", "I know. But if it's only 10 minutes, and she has to take a break from work, it may not be worth going back and she would have to just wait it out.", "He usually makes the bread rolls (not clear if they\u2019re always breakfast or a meal), but he doesn\u2019t mention he always makes breakfast or cooks and in fact says in another comment she cooks as well. I did mention I would understand if his issue was she never makes stuff, but she does. \n\nHe says so! \n\n> We only had the bread rolls for breakfast, so I was the one fully preparing for the meal with her doing nothing. We usually make dinners 50/50, with each one doing one every other day.\n\nSo she makes stuff. He made 100% of the meal but the meal was bread rolls. \n\nHe just framed this on solely the bread rolls (an easy food he usually makes). I don\u2019t think judging her solely on her reason makes sense. People don\u2019t get to say no they don\u2019t want to? If he had sat her down and said \u201cI\u2019m bummed I make breakfast every day and you never do\u201d they could have a discussion, I guess, but I think he just wants her to say yes and she said no.", "I think we found the girlfriend", "Yes. GF did nothing wrong. She said the rolls were too much work for her to make (at the moment) but she wasn\u2019t against eating them if he decided to make them (no pressure to make them). \n\nOP got mad at that and the only reason he didn\u2019t make enough to share is because he was angry she didn\u2019t say yes to his whim and interrupt her morning because he decided he\u2019s too busy (though he actually wasn\u2019t, as he made rolls). GF never asked him to make rolls. She would\u2019ve been fine if no one made rolls, and we don\u2019t even know she\u2019s mad at his obvious pettiness now.\n\nNo one owes you a \u201cyes\u201d at a request and frankly even the request feels a little disrespectful like his work is more important than hers (may not mean it that way) or she should jump when he asks. It wouldn\u2019t necessarily seem that way though if he\u2019d accepted a no with any reason though. Scrutinizing her reason is weird and not fair. It\u2019s not like she never cooks (he mentions she died in other comments). For all we know, she cooks things that take more work than rolls. She didn\u2019t feel like making these at the moment (he usually makes these, but he says she\u2019s done it before so she\u2019s not against EVER making them) and so she said no, too much work, not worth it to her at that moment\u2014seems fair. If he\u2019d not wanted to make them either and hadn\u2019t, I\u2019d say he wasn\u2019t ridiculous either. But intentionally slighting the other because they wouldn\u2019t do what you wanted is messed up.", "Well you have to remember that around here a woman doing something is fine but if a man does the same he's an evil abuser", "He doesn\u2019t say he always makes them for breakfast and he asked her in advance to start making breakfast. (Maybe she wouldn\u2019t ever eat breakfast if he wasn\u2019t making it though so that\u2019s a discussion you have etc.) \n\nHe just mentions it\u2019s an easy food he usually makes (when they have them) but she cooks other stuff. I don\u2019t think it is about him making lunch (well breakfast, this was breakfast he says) all the time. I think it\u2019s about him thinking her reason wasn\u2019t good enough and his time is more important than hers in this instance.", "She didn't say she was busy working, she said it was too much of a hassle. She doesn't want to be bothered but wait for OP to not be busy so she can eat the rolls he makes. That's lazy.", "It's probably more to do with the number of favours he has done her. \n\nIf I did the dishes majority of the time and asked my partner to do it one time due to being occupied, I don't expect the answer to be \"Don't wanna. Too much hassle\". \n\nBest course of action here is to stop doing her favours that make this response seem unfair. No favours, no expectation for return-favours.", "But that's not what she said.", "OP also never said the rolls were for breakfast. Just pointing out that you're adding your own details into this story. There's no reason to assume she was busy because she said she couldn't be bothered. Being busy is a much better wxcuse so she would've presumably used it if that were the case. No one demanded anything either.", "Exactly!!! OP actively wanted her to make him rolls, but she didn\u2019t really care. How is that entitled? \n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t even care if she is working or not. She still doesn\u2019t have to make them. It might be nice of her to do so, but it\u2019s not a requirement. If she was a SAHM and OP was demanding she cook for him while he worked, the sub would be eviscerating him.", "I\u2019m do something for my husband even when busy or tired and if he has a *need* he might ask me, but we know OP didn\u2019t *need* this because not only did the GF somehow find other breakfast/exist without rolls BUT OP made the rolls so had time to! It was a *want*, and asking her and then not accepting no gracefully and being petty is pretty ridiculous and childish. It\u2019s not like GF said driving him to the hospital was too much work or he had the flu and really needed help feeding himself. He asked a woman to fix him breakfast, and she wasn\u2019t planning on making the rolls (they sound good but more work than she planned for breakfast) and then he got fussed her reason for not being at his beck and call wasn\u2019t \u201cgood enough\u201d.\n\nOP showed no indication of taking care of her, just picking at her reason not to want to be at his every whim!", "Stop ranting", "You could just shorten this whole diatribe to \"I hate men and can not look at a situation objectively because of it\"", "And he never said at the moment at any time", "Omg if my partner and I were at home working and he couldn\u2019t do something bc he was busy with work I\u2019d be PISSED if he asked me to. He knew she was working, she shouldn\u2019t have to say it!", "We only know what OP said she said. We only get one perspective in these posts.", "Yes he did in a comment! \n\n> We only had the bread rolls for breakfast, so I was the one fully preparing for the meal with her doing nothing. We usually make dinners 50/50, with each one doing one every other day.", "I kinda pity your partner if you get pissed with capitals at them for asking lol, I would just say either \"Sorry can't do, I am busy\" if I were doing anything (doesn't even have to be work) or I would just help them if not busy...since well why not, if they're stuck in a meeting or something and I am free at the moment? Same way I would ask if I have my hands full, or am unable to leave the desk etc...", "Nobody works nonstop when they're WFH. People take breaks - say, for lunch or snacks. Asking your partner, \"Hey, I'm stuck in a meeting right now; do you have the time to handle this chore?\" isn't unreasonable.", "It doesn't say she was working... only that they both worked from home. Plus it is still not what she said. She did not say \"I can't, I am busy working\" she said \"no it is too much of a hassel\" (making the bread rolls).\n\nAlso the fact it has USUALLY been OP making them, shows the gf just don't want to, but happily just have them made for her.", "Yes, that's the basic premise here. So straight out assuming he's lying doesn't make sense, because then you could never give a judgement on this sub.", "First, pissed with capitals has me fucking howling. Idk why I\u2019m laughing so hard but I love that. Second, nah it ain\u2019t that deep you\u2019re right if I wasn\u2019t in the middle of something it\u2019s not a big deal to do a favour. I guess I\u2019m reading between the lines, cause this guy seems real upset that his partner wouldn\u2019t stop what she was doing to help him. Making the bread just for him is so petty, I guess maybe I question why, if she wasn\u2019t doing anything, she wouldn\u2019t help. I just assume she was busy since he says they were both working\nLikewise, if I\u2019m working in the same house as my partner who asks me to do a favour, I\u2019m not gonna say no I\u2019m working bc like, he obviously knows? When I wfh if someone tries talking to me I\u2019ll literally ignore them until I\u2019m done (barring emergency) because I\u2019m working! That is an established boundary though, my family tends to forget I\u2019m busy when I haven\u2019t been around. I think I just refuse to accept that this is the whole story", "I wasn\u2019t saying anyone was lying, just presenting their perspective on the situation while someone else may have a completely different perspective. That\u2019s why it\u2019s good to always take these stories with a grain of salt.", "You're suggesting he misrepresented his GF's reply. That's so close to claiming he's lying, the distinction is meaningless."]}
