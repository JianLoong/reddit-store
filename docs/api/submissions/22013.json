(His grandmother told me she would have done the same)", "It's petty but NTA", "NTA, gf is not too important to be heating bread rolls.", "I think it is weird to ask someone to cook something for you randomly, when you\u2019re both working especially. To me \u201cthat\u2019s too much work\u201d could mean many things in the moment (too much work at the moment, she likes the rolls but finds them annoying to make, she\u2019s too busy to fuss with them right now, etc). You also don\u2019t say how she reacted to you not making her any. \n\nAnd I do think that\u2019s petty because it\u2019s presumably no additional effort to make enough for both (unless you actually wanted a whole pack which seems wild to me\u2014 how much bread are you eating at once?) and I think being intentionally petty is never good, especially if her only slight was telling you she didn\u2019t want to do a particular thing (doesn\u2019t really matter why). I think it\u2019s kind of rude to ask her to make them if she was working in the first place. (Saying you\u2019ll take some if someone decides to make them isn\u2019t the same, because it\u2019s not a request to do it and definitely not a demand.) \n\nSo I think YTA or maybe E S H if the issue is she never makes you things and you have built up resentment. (You mention you usually make these but not if she ever makes anything, does other stuff for you, etc.) But I think you opened a bad box of bees by expecting someone to drop what they were doing and make you rolls, and it doesn\u2019t sound like she usually has that expectation of you at all.", "Ehhhh, ESH. You're in the right, but still petty. \n\nYou could and should have talked to her about it instead of being petulant, even if that talk happened after the work thing. Maybe she misspoke and actually meant she was too busy at that moment too? Maybe she's concerned that, since you always do it, she'll do it wrong and they wouldn't be as good? Maybe in her head this is one of your chores and it equals some other minor thing she 'usually' does so passing it to her is unreasonable? Maybe she didn't want them enough to get them so the effort was too low priority and thought you felt the same since you were deferring the task to her or later? Several possible reasons other than her being above it and you being seen as a lowly gluten-slave.\n\nTalk instead of pouting. Otherwise little things like this that literally do not matter become beating-sticks in bigger fights.", "INFO: Who cooked the rest of the meal?\n\nI'm leaning YTA for you only heating up enough for yourself since I'm sure it was only another 1% effort to slap a couple extra on the tray.  However, if she also cooked the rest of the meal, definitely YTA.", "Yeah, you definitely do not have a winner there,", "YTA. You were both working and neither of you were in a space where prepping the bread was a hassle-free experience. You got offended because she said she'd like some **IF** you made some, not when. You responded by being petty and punishing her for not stepping away from her work so that you could focus on yours.\n\nDo you think this helped or harmed your relationship?", "NTA Find a new gal this one seems to only think about herself and can't be bothered.  Clearly she is not one who likes to help out but likes to complain.  Do you want to be with this for the duration?", "We only had the bread rolls for breakfast, so I was the one fully preparing for the meal with her doing nothing. \n\nWe usually make dinners 50/50, with each one doing one every other day"]}
