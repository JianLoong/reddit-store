It was a lovely idea, but you said they will each get one which indicates you will gift them one.

Your SIL probably saw Kate's face and realized what she was thinking and went into Mama Bear mode.

Hopefully you don\u2019t put a strain on you and one of your niece or between the nieces because the one that couldn\u2019t pick out the color could think that you are playing favorites with the other one.

When I can, I get them distinct things tied to their expressed interests - for example, last xmas each of them got a blanket themed according to their favorite animal.\n\nSometimes we get them similar things that aren't immediately keyed to one girl or the other. When that happens, we decide (sometimes randomly) which girl gets which stuffed dragon/pair of cute cat socks/sparkly crystal thing. We only let them pick if we have TWO gifts each - then one gets to pick which of item A they want, then the other girl gets first pick of item B.\n\nIf they want to trade, they can.

As someone who always got the last pick, it wasn\u2019t fair to Kate.. How hard could it have been to add Kate to the video call? And even if not that, you should have made both girls same necklaces or something identical so they couldn\u2019t blatantly see the favouritism.", "What did Zoe get?", "I would have just asked them what colour they would like their necklaces to be and then surprise them with the style.", "Who's Zoe?", "Zoe?", "Well let's be real, yellow is not 'everyone colour' eventho you're miss universe... \ud83d\udc81", "There are a lot of comments already. But, to add another, I think the mistake here is when you mentioned that Joy had already picked. Even if she did call and pick out the green one, I think the best course of action would have been to not mention that fact to Kate (especially since she's the one who showed up in person) and instead just tell her that the yellow one is for her (which is true, given Joy chose the other one). It's not dishonest and would have saved some hurt. \n\nAlso, I wouldn't call them entitled for this alone (though you have more intel on that fact than I do). I think some feelings of jealousy or favoritism in this situation are completely natural, even if that wasn't the intention. \n\nBased on the info in the post, no one's the asshole. But I think in the future, you may want to handle things a bit more tactfully. Not that anything you've done here was intentionally inconsiderate, but you don't always need to tell the whole story to all sides. It's often better when you don't, especially with family.\n\nIf looking at things strictly tit-for-tat, I see where all the comments saying that you should've prioritized the niece who showed up in-person are coming from. However, I dont think that's entirely fair. It sounds like you weren't thinking ahead in that way when you got the video call. Which is understandable, but, again, I think mentioning that you gave your other niece first choice was the true mistake here. I wasn't there during your conversation with Kate, but, in general, there should be many ways of going around that and not mentioning your conversation with Joy at all. Maybe something to remember in the future.", "I will not jump into the discussion if yellow is ugly or not, because that\u2019s just personal taste.\nAnyway, also in for YTA, because of the choosing option. \nIf this was not an issue why did Joy and Kate made so much effort to get the \u201cfirst pick\u201d? Because they knew there might be one gift they might not like. \nIt creates competition between the girls which is totally unnecessary. \nYes, in some kind of way it is entitled, but to be honest, a gift which you don\u2019t like is not a gift at all. It is just trash. \nSo, if you want to make gifts then be sure the person likes it. \nThis could be easily saved like the others said by making the necklaces in the favorite color of each girl, so no one needs to \u201cpick first\u201d. I would offer this.", "YTA. You should not have mentioned that one got to pick and the other didn\u2019t. Should have just said this is for you.", "I'll take the yellow necklace if nobody wants it... you literally made it yourself with love, I wouldn't care how it looks.. yellow isn't even bad.

Keep being you.", "Your intention was very sweet, but only one girl is happy. Let's work on damage control or making up for it. \n\nThey will have another reason for a gift -- Christmas/ Hanukkah, passing some levels, a gift just because you felt like it, etc.\n\nLet the girls know that the next time you create 2 necklaces that Kate will have first pick next time.  This way Kate will know she'll have a chance to select and Joy won't be surprised that Kate gets to pick first.\n\nGoing forward should you be giving them both a jewelry gift at the same event/time ask the girls what color they'd like or if the want a bracelet vs a necklace. \n\nYou can ask the girls to buy a pendant they each like and you'll create the rest to compliment their selection. Of course if they each give you the same pendent,  ask what color they want. \n\nYes they are very close,  but at some point they may not want to share their jewelry any longer.  They certainly won't want you telling them to share. No matter how well your intentions are.", "Yeah this is what probably what happened. If OP would just explain herself that way, she'd avoid a lot of drama.", "I was wondering the same thing. If you're going to take the time to make something for someone, wouldn't you want the color to be intentional? Either it's a color the girl chose, or it's a color you think would look nice on them. \n\nIt's kinda impersonal otherwise.", "This is the thing. Make them the same unless you know they would like it like they have different favorite colors.", "I'm a twin and growing up if we got different gifts, we would always fight over the one we determined was better.  \n\nFrom then on, we always got the same gift and we were stoked.  Definitely made life easier for everyone else nothaving to listen to us silly children bicker over it.  \n\n(This probably makes us sound really entitled to be fighting like this instead of just grateful but we grew up really poor and getting something new was always a big deal to us since the majority of our possessions were hand-me-downs from cousins and our older brothers).", "Or just give her the yellow one and not show her the other one. If there is no compare and contrast she may have not reacted that way.", "1. My jewelry pieces are all one of a kind. No replication. Everyone knows that.\n\n2. The girls shared and swapped things a lot.", "It also would likely have been easier if OP hadn\u2019t told Kate which necklace Joy picked. I have two daughters. If they know the other one wants something, that\u2019s automatically the one they want, too.", ">the follow through falls short\n\nyeah I thought so too - it's not even a matter of \"take your pick from the current inventory from my etsy shop\", OP was making the necklaces specifically for them. \n\nLesson learnt for next time: take 2 seconds to ask people's preferences, if you can.", "I have to agree. I make jewelry myself and if I make some as present I asked the favorite color or decide on the skin tone, color they wear often, spring, summer, autumn or winter palette etc but I never pick a random color. I mean I want that the person that got the gift loves it and is able to wear it. Op should make it right either by changing the stone or making a new one. And for the future she shouldn\u2019t let her niece pick one and if there is a next time make she should make the jewelry for them (I mean she should decide which design and color matches the girls individually, personality wise and which color and design fits their look including skin/hair/eye color, I mean if she is that close to them shouldn\u2019t she already know)", "If Kate is very pale, yellow, which can be a lovely, color, will instead make her look like death warmed over, as it does me.\n\nAnd OP set it up in a way that maximized the chances of someone being seriously disappointed. \n\nOP, yes, YTA.", "The way this story is worded makes me wonder about its veracity & whether or not it was made up by ChatGPT?", "Or make both the same? YTA BTW, for the reasons above. You should have never let one pick, YOU should have chosen for them. Now it looks like you have a favorite niece to her, and I have to agree... why wasn't video call niece told to come by later, and in person niece allowed to pick first? And BTW yellow is such an ugly color for a stone, neither of them wanted it... it's the color of piss. Fix things by changing the stone on in person niece's necklace to one SHE gets to pick since you let the golden niece pick hers out.", "Yup. And honestly, I wouldn\u2019t be able to wear a yellow necklace. It would look awful against my skin tone", "It\u2019s tough, because it was a nice gesture. YTA. There were multiple ways you could have prevented it. If Kate had video called you first would she have gotten first pick? Especially since she also came by.\n\nAnd I can see how you see it as being entitled (and I guess it technically is), but I think it\u2019s more about how you made your niece feel (like you love/prefer Zoe more)", "I find it hard to believe that OP doesn\u2019t know exactly what she\u2019s doing here. I find it hard to believe that you could be this clueless.  She\u2019s obviously setting the girls at odds with each other and in the position to compete for her favor.  Offering one of them \u201cfirst choice\u201d isn\u2019t subtle. And based on what she says about them doing a lot of the same things, it sounds like the entire family does this to them.

I agree with others that it would have been better to either make a piece for each girl *specifically* or make two of the same necklace, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inherently bad that she didn\u2019t.\n\nThe issue was *advertising* that she had let one pick, thereby letting the other know she was getting what was left over. There was frankly no need to share that. It was as simple as \u201cyea, we talked earlier.\u201d\n\nOP, YTA for not handling this more gracefully, and for creating a sense of favoritism/disparity (regardless of intent) where there didn\u2019t need to be one.", "Exactly how I saw this too with the second person not having any real choice but to accept or not accept and I thing she rightfully and expectedly decided to not accept the \"leftover\".", "There is absolutely nothing here to suggest that if Kate had shown up BEFORE Joy called, she wouldn\u2019t have gotten first pick.\n\nIt was a dumb thing to do but there\u2019s no reason right now IMO to think that it was blatant favoritism vs. just being dumb in that moment.", "But Kate also came over with the expectation on getting first dibs, so I don\u2019t feel bad for her. But I agree OP can make another one. Though it is quite ungrateful to complain about a gift like Kate did.", "lol, no she\u2019s not, at least based on the words used in her post. If she didn\u2019t know Kate and her mom were stopping by, she did nothing wrong.  The necklaces also weren\u2019t specifically made for them. She was making necklaces and showed them off, and decided they could be gifts for her nieces. The only place she erred in her post, was not telling Kate she could make another necklace in green.", "Right? Who TF is Zoe?", "I was thinking the same thing, but this and other similar subs all seem to be like this. \n\nThe way they all try to tell OP what they should/shouldn't do/have done and rationalise their \"opinions\" as if it's flawless truth comes off so arrogant and narcissistic.", "Making a \"gift\" as a personal reward, then making one in a color that clashes with the skin tone of one of the two intended recipients when it comes to jewelry makes YTA automatically. OP most likely was trying to get rid of bad stock with the yellow one and put time and effort into the green as even OP talked in singular tense in regards to finishing the night before.  If you make something for someone you do so with their preferences in mind otherwise your asking for complaints about the gift and it's all on you.", "This is the answer.", "Thank you! Finally an actual adult!\n\nThis behaviour is entitled as hell!", "Fr I can't iamgine being so entitled and ungrateful.

Kate and her mom sound so selfish.", "No, no its not.\n\nSee, I'm pale, brighter colors just look ridiculous on me.\n\nIf I were the one offered the bright yellow necklace my response would be a simple \"No thank you\"", "Pale jewelry or clothing can be dressed up nicely but it also just doesn't work at all on some skin tones.", "I do this my nibblings! They will be super upset if they think that I\u2019m favoring one over the others so I started gifting them the same thing but in different colors.

Why do you think white gold and platinum are so popular? Yellow gold looks bad on many people as do yellow stones.
