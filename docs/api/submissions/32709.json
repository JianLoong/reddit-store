It was a lovely idea, but you said they will each get one which indicates you will gift them one. Instead you created unintentional conflict when you allowed Joy to chose and then you state Kate is acting entitled when she was disappointed she didn't get to choose first. Kate most likely feels hurt and confused. A little hurt that Joy was allowed to choose and maybe a little worried that you prefer Joy to her. 16 years old can be an emotional time. Your SIL probably saw Kate's face and realized what she was thinking and went into Mama Bear mode. Joy was allowed her choice and when Kate stated her choice you basically told her too bad.\n\nWhen dealing with girls the same age who are relatives or friends it may be best to use favorite colors, birth stones, or the same color and directly gift versus letting one choose first.", "YTA.

I get things that involve my interests or that they know I\u2019ll use. \n\nWhen I give gifts to my colleagues, they get a note and gift card or a nice bar of chocolate with the card.

When you gave it to her, you could have told her why you chose yellow for her...and give a reason that made her feel special. \n\nGiven that they came to see you in person, I can understand how a 16-year-old could feel less special for getting the rejected necklace. \n\nOf course she's being an entitled brat about it.

I mean, as an aunt, shouldn't you know them both better? at least what their favorite color is or what color suits them?! Hopefully you don\u2019t put a strain on you and one of your niece or between the nieces because the one that couldn\u2019t pick out the color could think that you are playing favorites with the other one.

Maybe offer to make Kate a green one? Do not offer her any other colors though or else Joy could be upset.

When I can, I get them distinct things tied to their expressed interests - for example, last xmas each of them got a blanket themed according to their favorite animal.\n\nSometimes we get them similar things that aren't immediately keyed to one girl or the other. When that happens, we decide (sometimes randomly) which girl gets which stuffed dragon/pair of cute cat socks/sparkly crystal thing. We only let them pick if we have TWO gifts each - then one gets to pick which of item A they want, then the other girl gets first pick of item B.\n\nIf they want to trade, they can.

As someone who always got the last pick, it wasn\u2019t fair to Kate.. How hard could it have been to add Kate to the video call?

But, to add another, I think the mistake here is when you mentioned that Joy had already picked. Even if she did call and pick out the green one, I think the best course of action would have been to not mention that fact to Kate (especially since she's the one who showed up in person) and instead just tell her that the yellow one is for her (which is true, given Joy chose the other one). It's not dishonest and would have saved some hurt. \n\nAlso, I wouldn't call them entitled for this alone (though you have more intel on that fact than I do). I think some feelings of jealousy or favoritism in this situation are completely natural, even if that wasn't the intention. \n\nBased on the info in the post, no one's the asshole. But I think in the future, you may want to handle things a bit more tactfully. Not that anything you've done here was intentionally inconsiderate, but you don't always need to tell the whole story to all sides. It's often better when you don't, especially with family.\n\nIf looking at things strictly tit-for-tat, I see where all the comments saying that you should've prioritized the niece who showed up in-person are coming from. However, I dont think that's entirely fair. It sounds like you weren't thinking ahead in that way when you got the video call. Which is understandable, but, again, I think mentioning that you gave your other niece first choice was the true mistake here. I wasn't there during your conversation with Kate, but, in general, there should be many ways of going around that and not mentioning your conversation with Joy at all.

Why wouldn't you have asked them what colors they would like? or selected colors that go with their skin-tone and the clothes they tend to wear? You just made two pieces and didn't care who got what.\n2. This notion that whoever got to you first, got to pick - that's a sure-fire set-up for disappointment!\n3. Think of it this way: Do all of your customers just love every single piece of jewelry you make, or do they feel drawn to certain pieces and not to others? Maybe for the color, or the material, or the style. You can't assume that any random piece you make is going to be what someone wants to have for themself. Also - can you imagine if you made your customers compete for which piece they got to own?!?

Either you ask her what color and make it, or you offer her one of similar value that you have already made. None of this should be offensive to you:\n\n* You did not have Kate in mind when you made the yellow necklace, so there's no difference between offering her the yellow necklace or another necklace. You were not gift the girls a necklace you made specifically with each girl in mind; you were just gifting them a necklace that you created. If you didn't care who got yellow or green, then you shouldn't care if Kate gets blue instead of yellow.

It's true in general that you accept a gift with grace. I know they are not being polite. But, frankly, you aren't either. You should have designed each piece with one specific niece in mind and given that necklace to that niece, but you didn't. You made a necklace that, apparently, neither girl feels would suit them. Would you rather Kate take the yellow necklace and say nothing... never wear it and never have that happy feeling whenever she sees/wears that lovely necklace her aunt made especially for her?

You could have turned the interaction into a positive by teaching her whats best to pair the necklace with and alleviate her fears about it clashing with her skin tone. Instead of a teaching moment you harshly judged her. What should have been a wonderful gift to associate with her hard work/passion for languages will now be a reminder of the favoritism you showed to her cousin.  Do better OP", "Exactly this! I made all my nephews personalized dream catchers. I made each one in their favorite color that was unique for them. That\u2019s what makes the gift special. If I had just arbitrarily made them and allowed each to pick and then leave the last unchosen one for that last nephew, it would have been a jerk move. \n\nYTA OP bc you never should have set this up in a way where one niece was expected to receive the left over necklace. You could have made 2 identical necklaces or separate necklaces to match each girl\u2019s preference.", "That's really sad for Kate. She worked hard, too, and you hurt her like that. Shame on you.\n\nFix this. Apologize to her and ask her what color(s) she wants for her necklace then make it for her.", "I agree.  They were rude when they admitted they were trying to get first pick, they were rude about complaining about what they received, and they were rude about telling OP what she should\u2019ve done.\n\nI think the whole situation sucks, but the mom and daughter need to be more gracious when receiving a gift.", "I legit thought it was the opposite. \n\nYep that's fucked up, I was soooo confused as to why everyone was acting like that.", "That is both equally cute and hilarious, I love how the salesclerk was suddenly like \u201csay no more\u201d \n\nI remember when I was a young kid I kicked up such a stink about my brother getting dragon ball z pyjama\u2019s that my mum had enough of hearing me moan about it and went out and both the exact same pair a couple of sizes smaller for me. She said that a couple of quid wasn\u2019t worth the aggravation of my endless whining haha", "She can now never use yellow or green in art again, why dont these children understand her sacrifice?", ">a thoughtful gift made by hand,\n\nWhat makes it a \"thoughtful gift\" , if neither girl liked the yellow necklace? Why do people always think that gifts the receiver hates require thought? Is the bar so low, you are just happy someone remembered you exist?", "Ungrateful is a word that comes to mind. OP didn\u2019t have to do sh1t for them! She could\u2019ve think better how to handle things but she came from a place of love and SIL and 2d niece are ungrateful  and rude. I wouldn\u2019t give anything to them after throwing such a tantrum.", "Oh, until we are WAY TOO OLD, everything we wore and every gift we received was the same but in our \u201cdesignated color\u201d. We have photo evidence. \n\nActually still to this day. For Christmas, my dad will get us exactly the same thing - my sisters will be some shade of red, mine will be blue - and a check. We open them up simultaneously so as not to ruin \u201cthe surprise\u201d. \n\nWe are 41 and 43.", "I agree that the Auntie could've done better, but your response is so unhinged. I'm pale, I look great in yellow.  Like you seriously sound fucking crazy and entitled ... maybe it's because I worked too long in food service & customer service but I can't read : HoW hArD iS iT To mAkE tHiNgS RiGhT. \nand not think you're intolerable to be around", "Yeah what happens when they both show up at the same time and say they want green.", "So if someone were to gift you a hand made item, you would say no thank you?", "True, just about every color is the color of something unsavory.", "Lol right? Wtf.. green is the color of boogers. Brown is the color of shit. Red is the color of blood. So should you never wear any of those colors?", "it's about the undertones of the skin I think. my mum wouldn't put me in pink baby clothes because it made me look jaundiced (I'm very pale and was obviously more so as a baby). I think it was bright pinks that were the problem since they'd wash out the actual pink in my skin", "I think the issue is that OP pointed out how she had given the other niece the pick. If she had just given the yellow necklace, it probably would have been a very different conversation. Whichever niece got to pick, having one pick is unfair. I would say to give one to each of them, especially since they can exchange if they both want. She could have let them decide between them if they were together, but even that is likely to cause problems.", "Yes, niece  should have thanked auntie and thrown the necklace  away or given the necklace away. \n\nBut it is hard to to be gracious when auntie plays favorites and is so unfair.", "This!  I taught my kids that you say THANK YOU even if you don\u2019t like the gift. It seems like my way is gone. Now it\u2019s me me me.", "But it's not? It's FCFS.", "Just stick with blue.", "Now that you mention it; guess not. Time to shop!", "Is that what it is! Yellow looks awful on me, but wonderful on my daughter and I've often wondered why. TIL \ud83d\ude42", "At that point, it\u2019s on OP to manage her own feelings.", "And why would you assume that? Even if OP happens to notice her not wearing it, there\u2019s no indication she\u2019d feel slighted by it or even act on those feelings if she does.", "Okay. And?", "My MIL makes beautiful ones. But sometimes, some model is plain ugly. I thank her. I tried it in front of her, give her a hug and thank you and goes to the drawer and try to wear it at least one time if I visit her. She is happy, I feel loved by her and it works for everybody. Sometimes I even take it off in the car if I\u2019m going elsewhere. It\u2019s not her obligation to gifting me anything and I was raised to be polite and thankful.", "You know how it is the thought that counts? Well the thought is that Kate is #2. OP could have just given Kate the yellow one without the additional information. Like what benefit is there to giving Kata the info that Joy got the 1st pick and you get the other one? It's not like Kate is getting a chance to pick anything.                \n               \nHere is a gift and this is the one that Joy did not want.            \n                      \nAnd why didn't OP just asked the girls in what color they want their necklaces before making them.", "I would agree if right before that OP didn't basically tell her, by the way, I let your cousin pick on video phone last night and you get the leftovers she didn't want. \n\nOP is TA for creating this situation. I saw this coming a mile away. I had a daughter/step daughter a year apart but in the same grade and they used to be so competitive. We never let one pick, they get what they get and don't throw a fit. And we tried to make them match as often as possible. This was just messy and hurtful for OP to say to her face as she gave it to her. \n\nSure Kate probably should have been better at accepting the gift and came off a bit entitled but she acted pretty age appropriate for being told she got the leftovers.", "She doesn't have to do it multiple times for this to be considered favoritism. We aren't saying Kate is her favorite. We're saying Kate was treated much more favorably than Joy was in this situation. That's the only requirement for favoritism to be shown and felt amongst Kate & Joy. How you personally define favoritism does NOT change how it's felt by the people it's affecting. If OP has empathy, she'll realize how shitty it would be to be the leftover necklace girl. That would be worse than no gift at all, especially when the first thing OP said (before Joy even saw or knew about the necklaces) was that Kate already got to pick without showing up to see her in person. That's even worse than the 7 Bop-its! my super rich aunt got me year after year for Christmas.", "I can't because of blue waffle \ud83d\ude29 lmao couldn't think of any other gross blue things", "I gotta thrown most of my clothes out now \ud83d\ude29", "Yup! And if you need to pick a color for many people to wear or unsure what color will look good on someone, go with jewel tones. Emerald, sapphire, amethyst purple usually look good on almost everyone", "Happy cake day \ud83c\udf70", "So how would waiting until both were in person have helped?  Each would have wanted the green one.   I guess they could have flipped a coin, and that would gotten away from the perceived bias, but one would still be unhappy.  However, we all have to learn sometime that we can't always get what we want *cue Rolling Stones music*", "First of all, you\u2019re mixing the girls up. Second of all, the initial comment this was replying to said that OP clearly favors Joy so some people absolutely are implying that this is a pattern and Joy is her favorite and again, a one time incident is not evidence of that.", "Do you understand that letting someone have their choice (because they requested it) is different than offering the choice?\n\nShe didn\u2019t go into that moment saying I\u2019m going to give this niece the opportunity to choose and not the other. She simply didn\u2019t deny the request. \n\nThe entire situation came about in an unexpected and unintended way because of the emergency.", "What should of been done since OP was making these is talk to them and asked what they liked so OP could of done something that both people liked. Or just decided which one got what and not given a choice to either person.", "Agreed.", "Oh, fair enough then.", "OP stated they gave the person who video called her the \"first pick\" She gave her the option to pick which one she wanted. That is grieving them a choice.  I want to know how you think that is not giving them the choice?\n\n They were allowed to choose the one they wanted. The only fair way to do something is to have given it to them randomly and not offer any choice as to which they get. \n\nIt matters not about an emergency situation or any other situation if you allow them to have first pick that is giving them a choice. \n\nThe only way for it to be fair would be just to give them it randomly and not let either choose.", "Good points", "YTA. Why didn\u2019t you just ask their color preferences before you made their gifts?  They would have been more personal if you had.", "YTA.\nMy cousins love cats, so me and my sister picked two necklaces with different cat figurines. And even though we barely knew them, we didn't say \"here, pick whichever you like\"; we assigned one to each of them. Same last time I went to my uncle's, he had a lot of kids over and we gifted one toy to every one of them.\nWhat you did was like pitting them to fight over your necklaces: whoever gets first, has first pick.", "Idk what is up with all the YTA comments. Did these people even read the whole story? You are obviously NTA in this situation. You made them gifts that you were proud of making. People who handmake things are generally really proud of what they do and they should be. Joy just made a decision on them that clearly wasn't expected as she had asked for the green one. You didn't call her to orchestrate a first pick. She called you informing you of her situation and how she couldn't make it tomorrow and she ended up asking. You saying yes to her was not an AH move. Kate is being really spoiled and entitled here. If someone handmakes me anything, I treasure it. That is a lot of work you put in and it shows how much you love them. I don't think Kate should get a necklace if she is going to behave that way.", "NTA at all. These people have zero idea and don\u2019t respect you or your time", "How did you think this would not lead to conflict? Soft YTA", "YTA.\n\nIt's no wonder you're a *hobbyist* Jewler as this approach to making Jewlery \"for\" someone is terrible.\n\nThere shouldn't be a \"pick\", you should have made one specifically for each one as in designed for her.\n\nIf you're going to do something, do it right, this just come off as a half assed after thought to me.", "Like nobody owns a black turtleneck", "I\u2019m biased as I hate yellow and it makes me look washed out. So YTA", "You don\u2019t know your 16 year old nieces well enough to make them a necklace? If you make a custom gift then make it to that individual preference. You can also asked them what they prefer.

NAH", "Yta", "I\u2019m not understanding why people think OP is the AH? She handmade custom gifts.

Take it or leave it. To stand there and argue over a gift is pretty despicable.", "Ummm what\u2019s with all of the hateful comments? You are NTA. You made gifts for your nieces.

To be fair why don\u2019t you just not give it to them? or you could just replace the yellow stone to green if possible and why would kate complain its a gift you made she should be grateful at least. don\u2019t spoil them too much.", "Honestly, it reads to me like OP wanted to make sure Kate knew Joy got first pick.  And from Kate's reaction I'm guessing this isn't the first time OP has done Kate like this.", "The thing I find weird about that though is Kate showed up \u201cearly\u201d with her mom so she could have \u201cfirst pick\u201d.
