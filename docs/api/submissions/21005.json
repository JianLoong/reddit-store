Many brides want more help from their partners but tolerate the lack of help because at least it can be exactly how the bride wants. The problem arises when the bride does all the physical and mental labor and the partner comes in with some zany idea with no thought or consideration for how it impacts the vision that she has spent months putting into action, or the additional mental load the partners \u201cfun idea\u201d adds. \n\nIf that\u2019s not your situation, please disregard.

You reacted fine when she vetoed your suit, but the one thing you asked for was a lapel pin with meaning.

Plus its just as common for bridesmaids to have matching jewelry, they probably will have matching bouquets, or a matching PIN for their bouquets.

Your future wife sounds like she's too worried about one day and not concerned at all about the rest of your marriage together. \"Her vision\" of \"her day\" is NOT more important than your happiness and y'all's future.\n\nFor our wedding, I ordered my husband's favorite carrot cake for the grooms cake, even though I don't care for it. I also ordered a huge tray of Raising Cane's for the reception because he loves that stuff. He wore Esc and Ctrl cufflinks bc he's a computer guy and we thought they were stupid and funny. Everything else was \"my vision\" but nothing was a deal breaker bc a wedding is about a MARRIAGE, not a singular party. We both had a great time, celebrating our future together in front of friends and family.\n\nGood luck, friend.

Consider couples counseling before the wedding, it\u2019ll help strengthen your relationship and better mentally prepare proof for what married like will be, weddings can be stressful, but she shouldn\u2019t react like this, you also shouldn\u2019t have to let her win every argument to keep the peace.
