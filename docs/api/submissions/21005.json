That's not small. 1 to 1.5cm is small. Cufflink size. 2cm is becoming noticeable. 3cm is not small. Your fiancee may have a point. They *may* be large enough to be clashing with the overall wedding aesthetic. *Note I said \"may\"*.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean you're wrong in wanting to wear an item of great significance to you, nor does it change the red flag your fiancee is waving about the childish and volatile way she handles conflict.

You don\u2019t get to say \u201cit\u2019s my wedding too\u201d unless you\u2019re equally splitting the sometimes overwhelming responsibility that comes with planning a wedding. I often hear people say \u201cIt\u2019s my wedding too\u201d when they have no interest in doing any of the hard work around vision planning or scheduling but want to pipe in with their own ideas, without any consideration for all the work that their partner is putting into it. Many brides want more help from their partners but tolerate the lack of help because at least it can be exactly how the bride wants. The problem arises when the bride does all the physical and mental labor and the partner comes in with some zany idea with no thought or consideration for how it impacts the vision that she has spent months putting into action, or the additional mental load the partners \u201cfun idea\u201d adds. \n\nIf that\u2019s not your situation, please disregard.

That way the official wedding pictures were still super classy, but we also took a bunch of fun pictures where we showed off the inside of our jackets like we were selling stuff in the back of a bodega.

My comparison is meant to highlight the absurdity", "Lol I married my Marine with no notice. I\u2019ve never thought about his commands reaction, but he had scheduled leave before we decided to get married and his unit went to the field but he stayed because of his leave. That weekend we ran into his friends and roommate downtown and he said \u201cthis is my wife\u201d and everyone was like \u201cwhat\u201d, pretty sure he told them he met me at the local strip club \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I surprised my husband by walking down the aisle to the Throne Room song (episode 4 finale) from Star Wars and he had a Boba Fett groom's cake", ">Are we going to cut our cake with an axe?  \n>  \n>Also yes.\n\nWow this is a thing?? Awesome. Makes me want to get married just to do that! Hope you two have an amazing day!\n\nI'm all for those little fun things in weddings. Some people make them so po-faced.", "You sound like an excellent future wife. Kudos.", "exactly, who cares. People on this sub take weddings so seriously. It's exhausting.", "I\u2019ve read about this Batman theme wedding of yours(?) a couple of times on this post now. Where do I RSVP?", "So I reread the first large paragraph, OP said that they were discussing wedding planning. I would assume that Bride is not doing this ALL by herself. Maybe the majority of it but that doesn\u2019t mean all, it could be a 60/40 split if they discussed it, but it seems as though she wanted it more like 70/30 or 75/25. I would assume if I was to ever marry, I would be with my wife or hubby every step of the way in planning. Of course I\u2019m minimalist so I would just go with what vibes with me or just go with what my spouse wants, but at least I\u2019m there discussing it with them and being there helping. I assume that if a bride or groom ever does the planning by themselves, either 1 they have a vision already and want no other input to derail it, so they choose to do it solo, 2 the spouse in question wants nothing to do with it so they\u2019re forced to step up and take control in which case major red flag and you need to leave or deserve what comes next as you didn\u2019t wanna listen, or 3 because their spouse\u2019s personality is chaotic dumbass and doesn\u2019t know anything about weddings. From what I\u2019m seeing, the bride is doing the \u201cI have things planned in my head a certain way, so I\u2019ll give you some responsibility but all this (most of the decor and coloration and themes and basically much of how everything is gonna look) will be mine\u201d. So definitely maybe a forced 70/30 at best that she decided to do.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019ve seen the pictures about the pin you\u2019ll see not only how small it is, but also how hard to tell it is. It\u2019s all gold, and from any angle that\u2019s not stabbing distance, it just looks like gold jewelry. Plus OP even suggested that the bride can do something similar to match, compromising something to try keeping it, but she flat out refused any form of compromise. Suits I can get, but if a bride can wear as extra of jewelry as she wants, then why can\u2019t a man? Like I would understand if it was an entire suit, but one small pin will not ruin a wedding.", "Happy 10 years! Lol I didn\u2019t tell my parents (who lived across the country) and they had never met or talked to her. I was at work the day after with horrible guilt and anxiety until I finally called them\u2026 my dads first words (he walked into there house after work right after I told my mom so I had to say it all again) he immediately said \u201cwell I\u2019m pretty fucking pissed, we would have liked a chance to get to know her or come to be at the courthouse with you but tell her we love her and welcome to the family\u201d \n\nI\u2019m horribly guilty about the way I did things.  I guess it just came down to me not wanting to discuss what I very plainly knew was not rational.  I knew the divorce statistics. \n\nLife has absolutely not been a fairy tale but we have 2 happy kids, a solid house and love.", "All chaps are assless, but not all asses are chapless", "Probs how it will look on the day to all the guests", "You're in. Come in theme or the Joker will turn you away at the door!", "Can I get an invite?  \n\nMy mother nearly had an aneurysm when she saw my cake top. Most of the rest of the wedding was very traditionally classic, which was fine, but I have a sense of humor and LOVED the cake top.  Yeah. Mom nearly stroked out. I put my foot down.  I got my cake top.\n\nThis was almost 40 years ago, when I couldn't be bothered with a \"theme\" and there wasn't computer gaming for ideas.\n\nI got my cake top, though.  I was happy.", "I, and all my western North Sea ancestors approve, though I get that your Goth Viking Wedding doesn't need my approval!\n\nYour wedding sounds like it well be a blast, damn the traditionalists!  Can I be an extra as an old Viking woman who has \"greyed\" as only a redhead can?", "Yes, this has been verified through many random encounters.", "Exactly", "bro what the fuck", "I agree.  It sounds absolutely nuts and I wouldn't advise others to do it, but I met my husband and moved in with him after just 3 months. We didn't officially get married until 7 years later but that's just because we weren't bothered about marriage. All of my friends thought I was moving way too fast and I agreed with my brain,  but I just knew he was the right one for me and followed my gut. I was only 22. We've been married for 11 years,  together for 18 years now.  The time has just flown by! \nLove to hear your parents are still happy!", "I must be rapid", "If I can come, I'll dress full goth and chase him with a razor and shaving cream!\n\nEdit: spelling", "JUST KISS ALREADY!
