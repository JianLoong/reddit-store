Many brides want more help from their partners but tolerate the lack of help because at least it can be exactly how the bride wants. The problem arises when the bride does all the physical and mental labor and the partner comes in with some zany idea with no thought or consideration for how it impacts the vision that she has spent months putting into action, or the additional mental load the partners \u201cfun idea\u201d adds. \n\nIf that\u2019s not your situation, please disregard.

That way the official wedding pictures were still super classy, but we also took a bunch of fun pictures where we showed off the inside of our jackets like we were selling stuff in the back of a bodega.

I do think having a particular pin visible in pretty much every photo of the evening is more significant and permanent than an air freshener. The groom is in focus all night.

It's clear from your comment history that you hate women. Anyone who has offered a different perspective that might slightly support the bride has been callednout by you. Emotions run high. Weddings are challenging. \n\nAnd women love cars just as much. Do you want to know my husband's opinion on the car we bought 5 weeks ago? The color and he wanted it to have cooling seats. I thought about the power train, AWD vs RWD, the cyclanders, towing capability, if it would fit the car seat, pricing, loan applications, and how it would fit into our mortgage to name a few.\n\nIt can be big, it just depends on it if it is 2 vs 3 cm. You also have to ask if it is it tied into his boutounniere? What are the colors of the wedding? Where is he wearing the pin? What is the color of the suits?

Have a nice day.", "Listen, we can sit here and whine about how unfair it is for men, but you know that's not true in reality nor relevant to this particular situation. I don't care what would be said in some hypothetical situation. Stop bitching about women and grow up.\n\nLet's engage common sense, shall we? Weddings are very important to women, generally moreso than for men. It's reasonable for her to desire control over a ceremony that she would traditionally have control over. Do you seriously not understand why an adult woman wouldn't want to have Sonic the Hedgehog staring back at her when she and her husband share their first kiss as a married couple? When her entire family will be there and hear about the bond OP and his friends made in the trenches of Sonic Adventure 2? Please. \n\nThe boys can go play Sonic Colors as much as they want at the bachelor party - and she can have a cringe-free wedding.\n\nI imagine her frustration stems from the same disbelief that I have. I won't condone her violent actions - though you'll notice her words weren't heeded. Sometimes you get married and give your wife the wedding she desires because you love her... Just food for thought. It is mature to defer to such a minor wish. Though Sonic doesn't exactly scream maturity, does it?", "Good for you. I can. I have a different perspective. I have been in her shoes. I have also helped plan and run friends' weddings and my own wedding. I thought it would be fun. It wasn't. Every detail, the budget, theme, guest lists, fights, table seating, family drama, cancelations, deadlines, payment, invites, chasing rsvps are just a few challenges you face on top of every other event. My husband and family helped a considerable amount. It was still grueling mentally and emotionally. \n\nAnd 3cm is a lot bigger than 2cm. If it's 2 cm, I don't see a problem with it. 3cm is a little big, which is why I suggested the socks.", "Exactly. I would assume these people would have been in his life for some time or meant a lot to him. He's now sharing one of his biggest life moments with these people.

Yes. \n\nAre we having fun just LOOKING at mad shit like drinking horns, carved wooden bound wedding books and tiny Viking ships for the wedding cake?
