You would be told in no uncertain terms that you have no right to dictate what she does with her own body.", "NTA YOU did the right thing by letting her accept a dance from someone else, dancing isn't cheating. \n\nSHE did the wrong thing by letting him then buy her drinks. She should have danced a song or two and then said thanks I need to get back to my boyfriend, or at least back to my friends.", "NTA. If she'd said no, the guy pressed, and then you didn't help, that would be one thing. But she's a big girl, and more than capable of saying no thank you. THEN, if she needed help, you would be right to step in.", "NTA. If she didn't want to dance with him, she should have said no. Your job would have been to tell the guy to take a hike if he didn't take the \"no.\"", "I think mostly NTA but poor communication across the board is what caused this situation. You didn\u2019t make a bad call giving your GF agency because some women would get very upset if their man stepped in and didn\u2019t let the woman control the situation. It just happened that she actually wanted that BUT didn\u2019t verbally communicate that to you until afterwards. so she instead let this guy overstep her boundaries and then blamed you for it, which doesn\u2019t make sense. \n\nIn the future I would pull her aside privately to ask what she wants so she could say she wants you to intervene, but that\u2019s in hindsight ofc.", "NTA.

You don't have to ask what she'd do if you weren't there because you literally watched her do what a *lot* of women do when they aren't sure how to get away from a man at a bar. Literally *all* you had to do was say she was your gf. Men respect other men in a way they clearly don't respect women.\n\nShe obviously wasn't there to dance or drink with random men. She kept looking at you in hopes you'd come rescue her from a situation she shouldn't have had to be in. Probably also was scared to tell him you were her bf because at no point did you act like it and clearly, you had no intention of protecting her if things went south and he got abusive.", "I'd go with a mild YTA here. Mild because you clearly are bad at reading her body language. \n\nWhen the guy approached you rather than her, shovin off the interaction to her made it seem like you are just eager to discard her.

It's understandable that she may have wanted more reassurance or attention from you, especially on her birthday, but it's not fair for her to blame you for not \"defending\" the relationship in this particular situation.\n\nIt might be worth having a conversation with your girlfriend to better understand her perspective and address any underlying issues or insecurities she may have.

You did the right thing standing up for her autonomy that she can make her own decisions. I think most women would appreciate that, it's a sign of respect for her and that you're not a controlling asshole. Her behavior does not impress me, she should have told him no to the dance I'd rather dance with my boyfriend here, but after that no thanks to the drinks, and after that absolutely no to the phone number. She clearly has a problem saying no to even a man making her feel uncomfortable, and I would see no reason to believe won't behave the same way anytime in the future when you are not present.

At any point your girlfriend could have said \"no\" to his advances.", "NTA, because you didn't desert her, she could have just said, no thanks, I'm here with my boyfriend. But you should have a conversation about how to handle this sort of thing in the future.\n\nHint: If a guy asks you for permission to dance with your girlfriend instead of approaching her directly, he's a jerk who thinks of her as your property.", "Soft YTA. If you are in that situation again, a better response would be, \"I'd rather you didn't dance with my girlfriend, but it's ultimately her decision, because I respect her as an individual.\" That way, your gf isn't left in the dark wondering if she's important to you. However, your gf should have said No to the guy if she didn't want to dance with him, should not have accepted his drinks, and definitely should not have given him her phone number. And again, if you are ever in that situation again, if you see your gf giving you that look, step up and put a stop to to the attention from the other man.

Get away before she tries to play even more games with you.\n\nEDIT: The only other thing I could have seen you reasonably doing is asking her if she *wanted* to dance with him.

I always establish that if they feel uncomfortable, we have an agreed upon signal for \"Let's GTFO.\" As for the people saying she needs to be more upfront in situ, being a man vs. being a woman is very much a Tale of Two Cities situation.

Wait until she lets her unemployed friend/relative move in with you indefinitely because she can't muster the spine to say \"no\".\n\nOr maybe she thought if she accepted the dance and the drinks and gave out her number, she could provoke you into a righteous jealous rage in order to puff up her own ego.\n\nI don't know how long you've been dating, but this is an early sign of someone who will expect you to just \"instinctively\" know what she wants and what she is thinking, instead of using her words and communicating like an adult -- and then will punish you by acting out when you fail to read her mind. If you stay in this relationship, you will want to keep an eye out for other incidents of this type of behavior. If this had been me, she would now be my ex-girlfriend.", "No, you're not. OP, you're not a mindreader. If she wants something, she has to express herself clearly, not give you looks and expect you to recognize what they mean.

If your gf was the type who was easily intimidated and had a hard time saying no then I would call you an AH (although you do make a good point on what would she do if you weren\u2019t there). However the vibe from your story makes it sound like she was letting this go on because she wanted to see where your boundaries were and not because she was scared. \n\nAnyways I don\u2019t blame here for being a little upset that you didn\u2019t say anything at any point. There\u2019s a difference between not being jealous and having 0 boundaries and I can understand why a person would be upset if their partner didn\u2019t seem to care if someone was heavily flirting with them. I\u2019m not excusing her actions, I think she was dumb, but Im just saying I also find your lack of care for boundaries a little weird. It was really weird how it slowly progressed and you didn\u2019t care one bit. \n\nSo starting with him asking her to dance. Like personally I wouldn\u2019t be okay with a stranger with my partner (depends on setting maybe, but a bar or club seems pretty flirty. Then again I\u2019m not a bar person).  However I guess I can see how someone could see it as just fun and not boundary crossing. \n\nThen he bought her drinks. One drink, sure a little flirty, but not that big a deal. However, when it progresses to \u201call these drinks\u201d that\u2019s pretty clearly flirty and a no from me. \n\nThen getting her number? Yeah that\u2019s clearly flirting hard. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you are an AH for not feeling anything. I\u2019m just saying for a standard relationship (I know every relationship is different) these are pretty clear boundaries that you wouldn\u2019t cross unless you\u2019ve communicated about it prior and I don\u2019t blame her for being upset about you not caring. It would probably brother me too if my partner didn\u2019t care at all.

No, she's upset because... what, she wanted you to deck the guy for looking at \"your woman\" like some shitty old western? Grow up sweetie. She didn't have to dance with the guy, she didn't have to take drinks from him, and she certainly didn't have to give him her number. She did those things because she is an immature teenager who wants you to play immature teenage games to \"win\" her. \n\nPass.

Just saying, \u201cif my girlfriend wants to dance with you; I\u2019m fine with it.\u201d Just something to show she\u2019s in a relationship so she doesn\u2019t have to deal with it because a girl never knows if it\u2019s going to be an okay thing or a big deal.", "NTA. She\u2019s weird for that. She gave him her number??? She is the one who didn\u2019t respect/defend the relationship by letting a guy do all that. She has no respect for you or herself. It is not hard to say \u201cno, thank you\u201d and that\u2019s it.", "Overall NTA. You understand that she should be able to decide for herself who she wants to dance with without you getting jealous. And to start from the assumption that she, as an adult, can handle herself unless she indicates otherwise. Great! \n\nBut other people commenting here do have a fair point that sometimes women (esp young women) do find it difficult to navigate situations where men are over-confidently (he literally cut in whilst you were dancing with her. Talk about arrogant) asking things of them whilst willfully ignoring any signals that they are not into it. It must have been obvious to this guy that she was uncomfortable if he'd only chosen to pay attention. If you had picked up on it from the other side of the bar, the signals were clear enough. And he was choosing to ignore that. \n\nAnd in a way, you were also ignoring that since you explained that she was clearly uncomfortable on multiple occasions. As someone who cares about her, this is when you subtly check in and let her know you are there to help if she needs you. As a woman, I would do the same for any of my female friends who were approached by guys in a bar and potentially looking uncomfortable. \n\nOn the other hand, going off some of the comments she made afterwards: is it possible that this was some kind of strange \"test\"? Did she want you to get jealous and step in to somehow demonstrate how much you care about her?  If it turns out this is the case, you can just tell her that you will find other ways to show her how much she means to you. And that you respect her too much to get possessive. And she shouldn't interpret that as an indication that you don't care. Quite the opposite.", "If you had said something, she might have accused yu of being a caveman and she\u2019s not property \ud83d\ude05\n\nNTA but a little show that she was your girlfriend (cutesy nickname or a kiss or something) would probably have been nice and enough to \u201cchase away\u201d the other guy\u2026 if she\u2019s uncomfortable saying no\u2026\n\nThen again, she\u2019s a grown up so if she doesn\u2019t want to dance or drink or give her number, she can open her mouth and say it herself\u2026", "NTA \n\nI would never want my bf to answer for me, and he knows that. But of course, that depends on the person. People that are more introverted can have a hard time saying no to someone and on those cases I think it's important for the friend or bf to step up.\nOverall, it's a communication issue, since you realized she was giving you weird looks you could have called her aside and asked if everything was ok, or she could have done the same if she felt uncomfortable. \nI find it weird that in relationships people get mad when others don't read minds, if it's something you never talked about, it's normal that the other person will not know how it makes you feel.", "This is absolutely ridiculous and you are NTA.\n\nYou're not even clueless. You expected her to be her own adult, and made a clear point that if you weren't there, what would she have done? She couldn't even answer that.\n\n\nThe relationship is probably done though. She wants to be a trophy, you want her to be a responsible partner. Not compatible.\n\n\nIf she doesn't bang him I'd be surprised. He's going to try, you can bet your balls on that.", "I think ESH, but only a little. This was her first time out and drinking at a club, I know I would\u2019ve struggled with speaking up at that age. I\u2019m also a very soft spoken woman who doesn\u2019t do well in these situations, especially when I drink. I don\u2019t drink because I NEED someone to watch out for me and make sure I\u2019m okay. She should\u2019ve been able to talk to you, but combination of everything above probably made it difficult. \n\nI praise you for giving her autonomy. Every woman is different, and now you know that she wants you to be on her defense when you\u2019re out. She knows that she needs to communicate more properly as well. \n\nBut in case I\u2019m incorrect: did she accept the drinks and give her number out because she was scared otherwise, or did she do it because she was petty and upset with you? If it\u2019s the latter, than I change my answer.\n\nEdit to add: those who say she needs to speak up like an adult: it\u2019s possible she\u2019s very passive and mild mannered, especially when it comes to older men. I wouldn\u2019t know how to handle the situation, at 21, with alcohol in my system.", "I don\u2019t know where the line is here, because I don\u2019t know her history, between her wanting you to grandstand and \u2018protect her\u2019 as in make other guys back off, and her potentially feeling if this guy turned ugly you wouldn\u2019t actually protect her. \nIn that situation I\u2019d just have said no, I\u2019m with my partner, and if he thought the guy was attractive my partner would have high fived me on a decent potential pull. And vice versa. \nIf however someone was persisting and creeping me out, he\u2019d step in. You mention you were keeping an eye out, so you were being protective but she might have been more anxious than you realised - I don\u2019t know. \nBut I do know women who have been in situations where they have felt, or been, unsafe, and they have a way of freezing up. \nSo I don\u2019t really know enough about your gf to judge.\n\n(Just to point out there are situations where women intervene when someone is uncomfortable- sometimes when it\u2019s a friend, sometimes when it\u2019s a stranger. So again without knowing more about your gf, I can\u2019t entirely tell if this is a gendered expectation or not.)", "NTA. She seemed to care a lot about your relationship by:\n\n> Dancing with another guy\n> Letting him buy her drinks\n> Giving him her number\n\nUnless she's looking for someone to control her, she needs to learn how to express herself and not foam at the mouth about her man getting jealous. If it's a matter of not being able to say no, she should consider therapy.\n\nThat being said, you're clueless, and could have picked up on those signs early.", "NTA.\n\nIf she wants men to fight over her, she's still very immature. But she's 21 so it's not entirely surprising.\n\nAdults don't go looking for drama in their lives and certainly don't *want* jealous, insecure partners. She needs to grow up.", "NTA. I get she may have felt a little intimidated to tell the guy \"no thank you\" like some people are saying here, but you were RIGHT there looking at them and ready to step in if the guy got pushy or aggressive. Nobody is a mind reader and she should have declined the other guy at some point.", "In most other circumstances, I would say NTA, and agree with a lot of the comments here that speak to your partner's autonomy...but OP - you specifically agreed to be the DD of this night, her birthday celebration.....to me, that implies that you're taking care of things. \n\nThe thing is, yes your partner could have said \"no\" - but saying no as a woman is very dangerous. Clearly this guy wasn't backing off, even though you were with her. I don't think it would have taken a strenuous amount of effort to have said \"hey - that's actually my girlfriend, and I'd like you to leave us alone\" or something to that extent. \n\nI can't in good conscious call you an AH - i know you're not a mind reader. but clearly your gf was looking to you for support, \\*likely during her first time drinking at a bar publicly\\*, and it's true that you left her at the mercy of this guy that wouldn't back off. it's true that you ignored her looks, or at the very least chose not to check in with her? or ask her what they meant? \n\nIt's a soft YTA. I'd have a talk with your partner. It's vital that you ask for more, clearer communication - and also apologize, for leaving her to handle a situation like that alone. I can really easily see how something like that would betray her trust - as a woman, it can be dangerous to turn men down.", "Yta if you stay with her, sorry your girlfriend danced with another guy, bought her drinks all night then got her number, did he ask you to hold the camera yet?. \n\nYou need to stand up for yourself and dump your girlfriend that is trash behaviour.", "Sure, she wanted to \"be shown of\" and you missed that. But anyone blaming you for respecting her bounderies (and dont forget, you did it whille still keeping an eye on her savety). She get's to ask for chivelary, definatally, but she has to make that clear. Because otherwise you would indeed have been mysocenistic. (Who the fuck could blame you for saying \"it's her body, don't ask me\") She doesn't get to be mad about you not reading her mind magically. Playing games is not  love.  And her dancing with him, accepting drinks and giving her number simply to get back at you was manipulative af. Do you want a partner that would do things just to hurt you instead of telling you her needs? Giving another person your number only has one purpose, I would consider that cheating to some degree.\n\nNTA\n\nIf you both figure out how to communicate what happened for you, why you did what you did and what you would like and need a next time you'll get out stronger. If you can't, it might be time to call it quits. Personally I'd have dumped her the moment she started to play such eleborate games.", "NTA\n\nHowever, I have some advice. By directing his question at you, this man made it very clear to your girlfriend that he valued YOUR consent more than hers. \n\nIn her position, I'd have felt pressured and uncomfortable at 21. Most women use the \"I have a boyfriend\" excuse to avoid confrontation when rejecting a man, it's safer... But her excuse is right next to her saying he doesn't mind.\n\nIt's like getting your parent to say no when you just don't want to go somewhere, or telling a customer in a retail job that it's policy or a management decision. \n\nWhen we feel uncomfortable, we give control and authority to someone whose decision is less able to be debated in that situation. \n\nYour girlfriend is only recently 21, she doesn't have much practice standing up for herself in these situations and probably needed backup. I think you can afford to give her some grace for her reaction here and calmly talk about it another time, and exactly what she would like you to do in future.", "I had a similar experience at Costco.

She alone is responsible for her behavior and in no way is OP responsible for \u201csaving\u201d her or defending anything.  OP is not her keeper or parent.
