You would be told in no uncertain terms that you have no right to dictate what she does with her own body.", "NTA YOU did the right thing by letting her accept a dance from someone else, dancing isn't cheating. \n\nSHE did the wrong thing by letting him then buy her drinks. She should have danced a song or two and then said thanks I need to get back to my boyfriend, or at least back to my friends.", "NTA. If she'd said no, the guy pressed, and then you didn't help, that would be one thing. But she's a big girl, and more than capable of saying no thank you. THEN, if she needed help, you would be right to step in.", "NTA. If she didn't want to dance with him, she should have said no. Your job would have been to tell the guy to take a hike if he didn't take the \"no.\"", "I think mostly NTA but poor communication across the board is what caused this situation. You didn\u2019t make a bad call giving your GF agency because some women would get very upset if their man stepped in and didn\u2019t let the woman control the situation. It just happened that she actually wanted that BUT didn\u2019t verbally communicate that to you until afterwards. so she instead let this guy overstep her boundaries and then blamed you for it, which doesn\u2019t make sense. \n\nIn the future I would pull her aside privately to ask what she wants so she could say she wants you to intervene, but that\u2019s in hindsight ofc.", "NTA.

You don't have to ask what she'd do if you weren't there because you literally watched her do what a *lot* of women do when they aren't sure how to get away from a man at a bar. Literally *all* you had to do was say she was your gf. Men respect other men in a way they clearly don't respect women.\n\nShe obviously wasn't there to dance or drink with random men. She kept looking at you in hopes you'd come rescue her from a situation she shouldn't have had to be in. Probably also was scared to tell him you were her bf because at no point did you act like it and clearly, you had no intention of protecting her if things went south and he got abusive.", "I'd go with a mild YTA here. Mild because you clearly are bad at reading her body language. \n\nWhen the guy approached you rather than her, shovin off the interaction to her made it seem like you are just eager to discard her.

It's understandable that she may have wanted more reassurance or attention from you, especially on her birthday, but it's not fair for her to blame you for not \"defending\" the relationship in this particular situation.\n\nIt might be worth having a conversation with your girlfriend to better understand her perspective and address any underlying issues or insecurities she may have.

You did the right thing standing up for her autonomy that she can make her own decisions. I think most women would appreciate that, it's a sign of respect for her and that you're not a controlling asshole. Her behavior does not impress me, she should have told him no to the dance I'd rather dance with my boyfriend here, but after that no thanks to the drinks, and after that absolutely no to the phone number. She clearly has a problem saying no to even a man making her feel uncomfortable, and I would see no reason to believe won't behave the same way anytime in the future when you are not present.

At any point your girlfriend could have said \"no\" to his advances.", "NTA, because you didn't desert her, she could have just said, no thanks, I'm here with my boyfriend. But you should have a conversation about how to handle this sort of thing in the future.\n\nHint: If a guy asks you for permission to dance with your girlfriend instead of approaching her directly, he's a jerk who thinks of her as your property.", "Soft YTA. If you are in that situation again, a better response would be, \"I'd rather you didn't dance with my girlfriend, but it's ultimately her decision, because I respect her as an individual.\" That way, your gf isn't left in the dark wondering if she's important to you. However, your gf should have said No to the guy if she didn't want to dance with him, should not have accepted his drinks, and definitely should not have given him her phone number. And again, if you are ever in that situation again, if you see your gf giving you that look, step up and put a stop to to the attention from the other man.

Wait until she lets her unemployed friend/relative move in with you indefinitely because she can't muster the spine to say \"no\".\n\nOr maybe she thought if she accepted the dance and the drinks and gave out her number, she could provoke you into a righteous jealous rage in order to puff up her own ego.\n\nI don't know how long you've been dating, but this is an early sign of someone who will expect you to just \"instinctively\" know what she wants and what she is thinking, instead of using her words and communicating like an adult -- and then will punish you by acting out when you fail to read her mind. If you stay in this relationship, you will want to keep an eye out for other incidents of this type of behavior. If this had been me, she would now be my ex-girlfriend.", "No, you're not. OP, you're not a mindreader. If she wants something, she has to express herself clearly, not give you looks and expect you to recognize what they mean.

If your gf was the type who was easily intimidated and had a hard time saying no then I would call you an AH (although you do make a good point on what would she do if you weren\u2019t there). However the vibe from your story makes it sound like she was letting this go on because she wanted to see where your boundaries were and not because she was scared. \n\nAnyways I don\u2019t blame here for being a little upset that you didn\u2019t say anything at any point. There\u2019s a difference between not being jealous and having 0 boundaries and I can understand why a person would be upset if their partner didn\u2019t seem to care if someone was heavily flirting with them. I\u2019m not excusing her actions, I think she was dumb, but Im just saying I also find your lack of care for boundaries a little weird. It was really weird how it slowly progressed and you didn\u2019t care one bit. \n\nSo starting with him asking her to dance. Like personally I wouldn\u2019t be okay with a stranger with my partner (depends on setting maybe, but a bar or club seems pretty flirty. Then again I\u2019m not a bar person).  However I guess I can see how someone could see it as just fun and not boundary crossing. \n\nThen he bought her drinks. One drink, sure a little flirty, but not that big a deal. However, when it progresses to \u201call these drinks\u201d that\u2019s pretty clearly flirty and a no from me. \n\nThen getting her number? Yeah that\u2019s clearly flirting hard. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you are an AH for not feeling anything. I\u2019m just saying for a standard relationship (I know every relationship is different) these are pretty clear boundaries that you wouldn\u2019t cross unless you\u2019ve communicated about it prior and I don\u2019t blame her for being upset about you not caring. It would probably brother me too if my partner didn\u2019t care at all.

No, she's upset because... what, she wanted you to deck the guy for looking at \"your woman\" like some shitty old western? Grow up sweetie. She didn't have to dance with the guy, she didn't have to take drinks from him, and she certainly didn't have to give him her number. She did those things because she is an immature teenager who wants you to play immature teenage games to \"win\" her. \n\nPass.

NTA.", "Idk I always laugh when my husband gets flirted with and my friends and I will be like \u201cwoooo yeah look at Timmy goooo!\u201d But he is also very shy and would definitely not take someone\u2019s number. You\u2019re NTA but you guys do need to communicate better. If she\u2019s looking at you weird then maybe step out and ask what\u2019s going on. She needs to not expect you to read her mind though too.", "This was girlfriend's original plan: go out on a few dates with the other guy. Then get engaged. Then get married, have a few kids. Then go back to OP screaming \"why didn't you stop me?!!\"\n\nNTA", "If she\u2019s so big on showing each other off, what stopped her from saying \u201cNot interested, I\u2019m with that incredible man over there!\u201d???\nDouble standards mixed with irritating mind reading necessities. NTA (I\u2019m a woman if that matters)", "NTA, I would have had the same reaction.  I strongly believe in independence, I want the person I am with to be with me because they want to be, that is why I never try to convince someone to be with me and in fact give them option not to be.  If I was in the same situation and the girl wanted to leave me and be with the other guy I would have laughed and wished her and him the best and then gone back to having fun on my own.  Some girls have weird perceptions about how things should be and they find it off putting when you don't behave how they think you should.", "NTA. Here's the perspective from  a woman (who was once 21 and went to clubs) and now old enough to be your mother.... \n\nA man in a club, walked over to a couple clearly dancing and having fun, then asked the girl to dance while looking at her boyfriend for a reaction. That is either a man with balls or is a man looking for trouble.\n\nYour girlfriend can speak for herself. She could have just said \"no thank you, I'm here dancing with my boyfriend\". Instead, what she did was dance with him, took multiple drinks from him and then gave him her phone number!!!\n\nI think you did absolutely the right thing by putting the ball in her court. Don't let her make you think you you have to \"defend\" your relationship and do not let her gaslight you into  believing that her behaviour was acceptable either. She was clearly trying to provoke you into a reaction too.", "NTA. \nShould actually appreciate how you handle these situations and the trust and freedom you give her.\nBeing in a relationship should not mean giving someone control over your choices.", "NTA  She gave him her number??!!? WTAF.", "NTA.  \n\n\nBut I think both you and your partner might both have been a bit naive in the situation.", "NTA. Those comments saying women have reasons to be afraid to say no, while right in many cases, you were there with her.  Also she had multiple occasions in the night to let you know she wasn\u2019t comfortable. She let it go as far as having drinks and then giving him her number. This sounds like one of those stupid tests. \n\nMy husband doesn\u2019t interfere but he would if someone wouldn\u2019t leave me alone. That\u2019s as far as I\u2019d need him to go. I\u2019ve met women who just want that public show for some reason, I\u2019ll never understand that. It\u2019s childish.", "NTA.  I swear, every step towards gender equality comes with two steps back towards 1950\u2019s gender roles.", "ESH. You noticed she was uncomfortable and never thought to maybe step in?\n\nI\u2019m shocked at the amount of women in these comments who are suddenly pretending like they\u2019ve never been nervous or scared to tell some guy in a bar to fuck off. \n\nI would definitely expect my partner to pick up on silent cues.\n\nHell, if not my boyfriend, I\u2019ve definitely given rescue signals and received the same from girl friends\u2026.\n\nIt\u2019s really weird that you just kinda\u2026.let that whole thing play out in front of you with no checking in or anything\u2026.I\u2019m saying this as someone who also does not get possessive or jealous.", "NTA, when are we going to stop the Infantilization of women? She had several moments to say no and be a grown adult. As with other things in live, she should not look to her boyfriend to make a decision. If then the dude would become more pushy, that would be the moment you could have stepped in.", "ESH. She is within her rights to want you to be openly protective of y'all's exclusivity as an expression of affection. You are also right to default to your gf being responsible for managing her own good time, not you. You apparently did not know from the outset if she would enjoy dancing with others, and she was not aware you have a modern view of dating role standards.\n\nY'all are missing each other in the dark by not openly communicating about this, or any of what happened as it happened. You displeased her and she pouted instead of using her words. You saw she was upset but incorrectly assumed what the problem was instead of just asking what was bothering her. \n\nI do not buy comments about concluding she was afraid of the guy. She said she was upset that you didn't protect the relationship, not her.\n\nY'all are both relatively young. Take this as a learning opportunity in communicating with your partner better.\n\nAnd if speaking honestly about that ends up with a \"I shouldn't have to tell you what to do, you should just do it\" talking point, y'all may just be incompatible.", "NTA at all. Yes, you two are in a relationship, however you show that you are not a controlling partner and let your partner make their own decisions. She did not have to say yes. Should could have easily said, \"No thanks, I want to keep dancing with my boyfriend\", but she chose to be weirdly (to me at least, her behaviour is bizarre to be honest) meek and submissive in a situation where you gave her the control. And then she goes and blames you for everything that happened, expecting you to come up and demand the other guy leaves.", "NTA It is not my job to guard my partner. It is on them to tell people that they would rather not spend time with them. \n\nIf someone was flirting with my partner I would not go between as well. I trust my partner and the moment I don't is the moment I have to think about the future of my relationship.", "Man I am seeing some TRASH takes in this sub, but I\u2019ll be generous and grant you a SOFT YTA.\n\nYes she \u201ccould\u201d have been more forthright and said no to this guy and I understand your perspective of letting her make her own choices, but you SAW her LOOKING TO YOU for help. It doesn\u2019t matter what she would have done if you weren\u2019t there, because you WERE. You SAW her discomfort and chose to do nothing. You even acknowledge that she was worried about this guy drugging her drinks, so why on earth would she not also have been afraid to deny him for fear of his reaction?? We don\u2019t yet live in a world where women are SAFE to speak their mind in these situations. She was giving you every signal she could, and you pretty much ignored it. \n\nI think I saw someone else on here describing how women are socialized to always be nice and polite to their own detriment, and that is absolutely what was going on here. She was TERRIFIED man, and you were RIGHT THERE and said NOTHING!! Even if you really just weren\u2019t picking up on the guys intentions, you definitely should have gotten a clue when he asked for her number??? This wasn\u2019t really about you seeing her as an intelligent person, you\u2019re just using that \u201clogic\u201dto justify acting like a Bystander. Sadly a lot of men do this, and that\u2019s why even the \u201cgood\u201d ones are still responsible for r*pe culture to some degree because they just LET these things play out RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM!!! \n\nI know you think you had good intentions, but you failed her. I guess this wasn\u2019t a very soft YTA after all, but please PLEASE learn from this, apologize, and do better in the future. You do seem like a decent guy who just had a severe lapse of judgement, but it\u2019s what you do with this going forward that really matters. I wish you the best, and hope you two can recover from this.", "ESH. Her for not immediately saying that she was with you and did not want to dance with random guy, and you for acting like you couldn\u2019t care less that she was being hit on by another guy. It\u2019s great that you want her to have bodily autonomy and that she\u2019s not \u201cyours\u201d (both of which are true, and you get that), but it\u2019s a whole other thing to act like you don\u2019t care if some other guy buys her drinks, gets her number, and spends his time with her.", "NTA, but while I really respect and appreciate you for acknowledging her autonomy (because that is really rare in men sometimes) but cmon dude. As a  feminist woman, I will straight up say that it feels good when your boyfriend is proud of having you as a girlfriend! It makes you feel confident and hot and sexy and wanted and that\u2019s what she meant by \u201cshow her off\u201d. It would\u2019ve made her feel good if you just told the guy she was your girlfriend and been a little protective of her, nothing crazy, but at least act like shes your gf! I already know people are going to start saying \u201csHeS nOt hIs pRoPeRty\u201d but if my boyfriend did what you did I would have felt a little sad inside too.", "Not supporting, encouraging or playing into her toxic femininity mind reading power trip is not clueless. Good for OP for behaving like an awesome human. Totally NTA.  \nThe one that needs to get a clue is his GF.", "Yeah, with OP right there (and the guy obviously knew they were together) she could have danced, maybe accepted a single birthday drink, then begged off to go back to her boyfriend.\n\nI understand a bit of polite/placating flirting, especially when you've gotten tipsy, but if the dude was going too far, she had an excuse to ditch him.", "Dancing could be cheating! Everyone has different boundaries of what they consider \u201ccheating\u201d.", "Gal could\u2019ve rescued herself with a two letter word: NO", "She can say no. She's a big girl.", "No means no though. All SHE had to do was say it. Cmon mans doesn\u2019t have to defend a woman its 2023.", "Comment straight out of r/RomanticAdvice", "Yeah women need to be more disagreeable. If someone got persistent with me at the club, first thing I\u2019m doing is saying no, they continue, I will start yelling, they touch me, I will fight them off and start screaming.", "Idk depends, I once created a fake boyfriend due to an Uber driver not letting up for anything else.\n\n No, I don't want any ect was met with agitation/ clear frustration that made me uncomfortable,  But being taken by this fake man did the trick. \n\nIt's hard to say no to someone when you don't know what they would do. I would not bet on my BF helping the way OP acted. \n\nFauning is a trama responses", "Seems alot of people on this sub have not run into the man that \"debates you no\" fallows you when you walk away. Acts like a puppy and won't stop for anything (not even I have a partner or gf) but having a boyfriend or man makes you off limits, bit also only if there there. So like \"so why is your BF not here then his loss right?\" \n\nI had one dude not leave me alone until I was walked out to my car by the freaking bouncer.", "OP I actually respect you for giving your girlfriend that choice. You clearly respect her, and unfortunately it seems like she wanted more of primitive \u2018manly\u2019 approach, like \u2018gtfuck away from my girlfriend\u2019 man. You are NOT a mind reader, you respected your girlfriend\u2019s autonomy, and she has no right to be pissed at you. NTA - also why tf wouldn\u2019t she just say no to giving out her number!? What is with this agreeableness?? She needs to learn how to say no. You\u2019re awesome OP!", "No you\u2019re fine. I hate drama and jealousy. When I am in a relationship with someone I always tell them it\u2019s their responsibility to turn people away, not mine to go up in their face and say \u201che\u2019s mine\u201d! It\u2019s childish and I am too grown for that. \n\nThe fact that she just kept going along with it says something to me though. It\u2019s not so much trying to see your reaction if she even gave him her number.", "No, you're just dating an immature drama queen.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. If she wants a guy to go all possessive baboon over her, she needs to seriously grow up. A normal woman would just reject adcances without passively aggressively trying to make her boyfriend jealous.\n\nYou're doing fine. You might need to date a woman who's not still 15 maturity wise though.", "I think I read the clueless as your gf being that", "You're also probably not going to go along with it because you want your husband to go all possessive baboon pissing on your leg, so there's that.", "Okay OP is definitely NTA but let\u2019s not shove our own viewpoints onto someone without knowing everything going on in their head. I am much like you in that I have no problem telling a guy to fuck right off, but a LOT of women are uncomfortable telling men \u201cno\u201d because of how they were raised or past experiences or stories from friends\u2026I mean just take your pick. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m wrong but it sounds to me that she may have been reluctant to say no to someone acting aggressively (if he\u2019s pointedly looking at the boyfriend during every interaction it honestly kind of sounds like he\u2019s trying to get him to fight????) and was hoping her boyfriend would get her silent cues and intervene. I don\u2019t put fault on her in this scenario and I also don\u2019t put fault on him because it\u2019s not something on the forefront of his mind. \n\nOP you should just sit down and have a conversation with your girlfriend. Say you respect her as an independent adult but acknowledge that there may be situations where she DOES need you to back her up and come up with some sort of signal you can use in the future to prevent these kinds of situations. Problem solved.", "I agree. It\u2019s not on the partner to overly \u201cdefend\u201d the relationship. TBH, OP did a great job vibing her the autonomy to say yes or no. He seems very comfortable and trusting in their relationship, which is a huge green flag. Didn\u2019t even have an issue with her dancing with another man because he trusts her that much. Seems to me that either gf is uncomfortable with saying no to people (which is valid), or that she WANTED OP to act jealous and possessive, which is not valid.\n\nOP, NTA, and I think a deep talk needs to be had with your gf.", "You see if my ex was anything like you, I think we would've had a better relationship. I loved her but I swear it felt like pulling teeth to get her to talk to me about what she wants me to do.", "Lol, comment straight out of r/seducingwomen", "I understand this perspective, but fundamentally, it sounds like OP cares about respecting his girlfriend\u2019s agency and autonomy. The guy asked to dance with her and asked for her number- she is a full-ass adult who is capable of saying \u2018no.\u2019 Sounds like OP and gf have different expectations. Personally, what OP did is a huge, massive green flag I rarely see on here.", "Oh please. She wasn't the scared victim of a predator, she was just trying to elicit jealous behaviour from her boyfriend. Let's not turn this into something that it's not.", "She was mad that he didn't throw a jealous fit, so she kept going further to try to make him jealous. He's not an asshole, so he let her make her own choices. \n\nIf she wants someone to fly into a jealous rage of other guys come on to her, she needs a different BF.", "Sometimes I read a comment and ask myself \"wow, what kind of an asshole says this kind of stuff?\"\n\nCheck this guy's/gal's comments, people. They are pretty much exactly what you'd expect.", "I feel like \u201cdefend\u201d is the wrong word to use in this context. OP\u2019s girlfriend more than likely just wanted some romantic grandstanding behavior. Like \u201cyeah, my girlfriend is hot and I know you want to dance with her, but too bad.\u201d It\u2019s her birthday, she\u2019s feeling cute and this dude literally comes up to hit on her. She wanted her boyfriend to show a little emotion/jealousy, but instead he\u2019s standing there all blas\u00e9 and nonchalant.\n\nOP, you sound like a good boyfriend. You understand bodily autonomy and treat your partner as a person capable of making their own decisions. Kudos! But sometimes it\u2019s nice to feel wanted. Sure, she could have told that guy she was with you, but she wanted *you* to do it in that moment.", "When she asked why he didn\u2019t defend their relationship, my question would have been \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you?  You accepted drinks and gave him your number\u201d. A dance means nothing but drinks and phone number means something else altogether.  The person who should be wondering what the hell was going on was OP", "Idk if that's a good thing or not since I've only ever tried to seduce guys \ud83d\ude02", "I get that she can certainly choose to do that. I question why this dude just stands by and watches it. Does *he* have any agency? Does he have any part to play here?", "It's certainly not \"on\" him. I'm not blaming him for anything. I just question why, if he actually likes this girl, he'd watch another man dance with her, chat her up, buy her drinks, and then get her number. How much would he watch before he reacts, is my question.", "A dude who lets another man dance with his girl, chat her up, buy her drinks, and then get her number is most certainly about to find out exactly what it is.", "Idk, I kind of read her behavior like this: a LOT of women have it drilled into our heads to be conciliatory in situations like these. I have seen tons of posts over the internet where schools will force girls to dance with any boy who asks\u2026it\u2019s a whole thing, not to mention the pressure our whole lives to subjugate our comfort for that of, well, everyone else. That shit takes a really long time to unlearn, I didn\u2019t do it until my late 30\u2019s. OP is definitely NTA, but perhaps it wasn\u2019t a stunt by the gf. She certainly needs to learn to properly and effectively communicate, but maybe she wasn\u2019t doing it manipulatively", "Exactly! Thank you for saying this! Every woman in here pretending like they wouldn\u2019t have felt the exact same way (even just a little)", "There is nothing AITA will not twist to place blame on men SMH.", "Where did I say it was his fault? He isn\u2019t a mind reader and the girlfriend was playing typical 21 year old games. I\u2019m just explaining it from her point of view. Chill out with the \u201cwoe is men\u201d mentality.", "You're doing some womansplainin' to justify her total passivity and lack of agency.\n\nAs I said before, standard for AITA\n\nMind how you go.", "And you\u2019re doing some mansplainin\u2019 to justify why you\u2019re purposely missing the point. So I think we can call it even now."]}
