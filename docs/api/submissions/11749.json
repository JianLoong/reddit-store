But I don't think it makes you the AH though.", "As a woman I might get in trouble for this, but- if you had told the guy no, everyone here would be vilifying you for daring to make decisions for a grown woman. You would be told in no uncertain terms that you have no right to dictate what she does with her own body.", "NTA YOU did the right thing by letting her accept a dance from someone else, dancing isn't cheating. \n\nSHE did the wrong thing by letting him then buy her drinks. She should have danced a song or two and then said thanks I need to get back to my boyfriend, or at least back to my friends.", "NTA. If she'd said no, the guy pressed, and then you didn't help, that would be one thing. But she's a big girl, and more than capable of saying no thank you. THEN, if she needed help, you would be right to step in.", "NTA. If she didn't want to dance with him, she should have said no. Your job would have been to tell the guy to take a hike if he didn't take the \"no.\"", "I think mostly NTA but poor communication across the board is what caused this situation. You didn\u2019t make a bad call giving your GF agency because some women would get very upset if their man stepped in and didn\u2019t let the woman control the situation. It just happened that she actually wanted that BUT didn\u2019t verbally communicate that to you until afterwards. so she instead let this guy overstep her boundaries and then blamed you for it, which doesn\u2019t make sense. \n\nIn the future I would pull her aside privately to ask what she wants so she could say she wants you to intervene, but that\u2019s in hindsight ofc.", "NTA. All she had to do was say no thank you when the guy asked her to dance. If he had hassled her after she declined then you back her up.

You don't have to ask what she'd do if you weren't there because you literally watched her do what a *lot* of women do when they aren't sure how to get away from a man at a bar. Literally *all* you had to do was say she was your gf. Men respect other men in a way they clearly don't respect women.\n\nShe obviously wasn't there to dance or drink with random men. She kept looking at you in hopes you'd come rescue her from a situation she shouldn't have had to be in. Probably also was scared to tell him you were her bf because at no point did you act like it and clearly, you had no intention of protecting her if things went south and he got abusive.", "I'd go with a mild YTA here. Mild because you clearly are bad at reading her body language. \n\nWhen the guy approached you rather than her, shovin off the interaction to her made it seem like you are just eager to discard her.

It's understandable that she may have wanted more reassurance or attention from you, especially on her birthday, but it's not fair for her to blame you for not \"defending\" the relationship in this particular situation.\n\nIt might be worth having a conversation with your girlfriend to better understand her perspective and address any underlying issues or insecurities she may have.

You did the right thing standing up for her autonomy that she can make her own decisions. I think most women would appreciate that, it's a sign of respect for her and that you're not a controlling asshole. Her behavior does not impress me, she should have told him no to the dance I'd rather dance with my boyfriend here, but after that no thanks to the drinks, and after that absolutely no to the phone number. She clearly has a problem saying no to even a man making her feel uncomfortable, and I would see no reason to believe won't behave the same way anytime in the future when you are not present.

Which is weird and kinda AHish for pinning it to you", "YTA. You effectively told the guy that she was romantically available.", "NTA, unless I'm missing something. At any point your girlfriend could have said \"no\" to his advances.", "NTA, because you didn't desert her, she could have just said, no thanks, I'm here with my boyfriend. But you should have a conversation about how to handle this sort of thing in the future.\n\nHint: If a guy asks you for permission to dance with your girlfriend instead of approaching her directly, he's a jerk who thinks of her as your property.", "Soft YTA. If you are in that situation again, a better response would be, \"I'd rather you didn't dance with my girlfriend, but it's ultimately her decision, because I respect her as an individual.\" That way, your gf isn't left in the dark wondering if she's important to you. However, your gf should have said No to the guy if she didn't want to dance with him, should not have accepted his drinks, and definitely should not have given him her phone number. And again, if you are ever in that situation again, if you see your gf giving you that look, step up and put a stop to to the attention from the other man.

Get away before she tries to play even more games with you.\n\nEDIT: The only other thing I could have seen you reasonably doing is asking her if she *wanted* to dance with him.

I always establish that if they feel uncomfortable, we have an agreed upon signal for \"Let's GTFO.\" As for the people saying she needs to be more upfront in situ, being a man vs. being a woman is very much a Tale of Two Cities situation.

She's going to have a long, hard life of continually getting walked on, if that's the case -- and you are going to end up taking the collateral damage for her being a doormat for other people. Wait until she lets her unemployed friend/relative move in with you indefinitely because she can't muster the spine to say \"no\".\n\nOr maybe she thought if she accepted the dance and the drinks and gave out her number, she could provoke you into a righteous jealous rage in order to puff up her own ego.\n\nI don't know how long you've been dating, but this is an early sign of someone who will expect you to just \"instinctively\" know what she wants and what she is thinking, instead of using her words and communicating like an adult -- and then will punish you by acting out when you fail to read her mind. If you stay in this relationship, you will want to keep an eye out for other incidents of this type of behavior. If this had been me, she would now be my ex-girlfriend.", "No, you're not. OP, you're not a mindreader. If she wants something, she has to express herself clearly, not give you looks and expect you to recognize what they mean. Your gf wanted you to \"defend\" her, but plenty of women would have gotten angry at you had you done so. There's no way for you to know what she wants unless she says it. I think it's reasonable to default to treating her like a grown adult who can make her own choices. \n\nShe had *plenty* of time at the club to tell you how she wanted you to tell the guy off. If you guys have never discussed how to handle situations like this, it's not fair for her to expect you to act how *she* wants you to act. \n\nLike, I kind of get all the ppl saying the guy made her uncomfortable and she wanted you to do something about it, but *you were right there* in case something happened. If she had said no to dancing with him and he tried to push the issue, presumably you would stand up for her at that point bc you would have known she didn't want to be near him. And if she doesn't trust you to do that, then why would she be with you?", "She wanted to play a game and is mad you didn't read her mind and play the game she had invented in her head.  \n\n\nNTA. Dense as fuck. but NTA.", "So if some strange guy tries to buy you drinks and asks for your number, you are incapable of saying \"no\"???", "GF getting flirted \\*still\\* not OP's problem unless it's either been discussed beforehand or grievous bodily harm is imminent.", "Eh it's archaic to expect that a guy has to be all ''back off mate'. She's her own person, not property. She can handle saying ''no'' herself, there's no reason for him to get involved unless it escalates.\n\nWhat's inappropriate is that unless he has a say about it she's very comfortable giving out her number to others. So he has to defend their relationship because she's not willing to herself?\n\nJust really strange all around. She needs to stop playing the ''chase me and fight for me'' game or she'll never have a normal stable relationship.", "She was out with her friends as well as her boyfriend, she had other back up. She's 21 I am sure she has had to reject or deter random guys before. She didnt defend their relationship by making it clear to this guy that she was dancing with her boyfriend either.", "In a perfect world where men weren't constantly having insanely violent responses? Sure. In reality women have literally been murdered for telling men no at bars and nightclubs.", "have you been to a club with drunk guys that grope women even when they dont want it?  besides that there are ingrained responses by men and women brought about by the years our species spent on a subsistence level.  some women still want a man to stand up for them and make them feel safe and they are not wrong for wanting that.", "You make a good point. I know that men act like they can't take no for an answer, which is a dick move.\n\nI also feel like the OP is clueless about this stuff. Like it was clear that this guy is hitting on his GF, but he didn't speak up that she is taken. She can make the decision for herself since she is an adult, but I feel like the additional things she did made it seem like she was available (sexually/romantically).", "Yes, in response to OP. These can both be true, but OP went first. She is not the AH because she was just following OP\u2019s lead.", "Her mans is literally right there lmao, what's gonna happen to her", "I am vehemently against the infantilization of women. If you have a problem with something, say so. Nobody has time to guess what's on your mind", "He literally said it was her body. All she had to do was tell the guy no and she didn\u2019t.", "You mean besides letting him cut in, buy her drinks and get her phone number? How could any boyfriend object?", "\ud83c\udfc6\n\nExactly! OP was clearly stupid as he could tell she was uncomfortable but didn't check on her. But I don't need someone talking for me. I have a voice box.", "Of course it\u2019s her body, but the expectation is that he\u2019d in some way signal that they\u2019re together. The other guy likely isn\u2019t try to break up anyone\u2019s relationship, so was trying to see if she was available.  OP might as well have said, \u201cShe\u2019s not my girlfriend.\u201d\n\nHer reaction isn\u2019t exemplary, but what do you expect after that? OP blindsided her and all but told her to do it.", "She consented to all three of these things happening, if she had said no to any of them and other dude had started being pushy then I assume OP would have stepped in at that point. He just didn't step in as long as she was consenting to it because he reasoned that she had  autonomy to make those decisions for herself", "She has a mouth sweetie, if you are with your partner and someone ask you to dance, you answer first and say no.", "Guys just can\u2019t do anything right these days, can they? If he told the man to back off, he would have been controlling and abusive as it is HER choice. If he lets her make the decision, he\u2019s apparently in the wrong for not standing up for her. Jesus. How the hell are men meant to navigate the dating waters? And I ask this as a woman.", "Who told you that men get chastised for saying, \u201cThat\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d? There\u2019s a happy medium between being abusive and disclaiming the relationship entirely. I\u2019m not saying he should try to fight the guy.", "I would be having pretty harsh words later on with my boyfriend if he *ever* presumed that he had the right to speak for me and make decisions for me. Or saying \u201cThat\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d as if that somehow meant that I didn't have the option to respond with a \"yes\" if I wished.\n\nAnd if that behavior persisted, he would be an **ex**-boyfriend.", "But, again, she has a voice. Bodily autonomy. She was trying to play games and it\u2019s childish.", "You\u2019d be pissed if your boyfriend said he was your boyfriend? Uh-huh. Sure.", "Games? What are you even talking about? You\u2019re on a different planet.", "I'd be pissed if he said it, as in *your* example, in response to a guy asking **me** a question, as if that somehow was an answer he was making on my behalf.\n\nWhether he's my boyfriend is irrelevant. \\*\\*I\\*\\* am the one who gets to decide. \\*\\*I\\*\\* am the one who gets to give the answer.", "She\u2019s an adult. He doesn\u2019t have to speak for her. The guy came over and asked and that\u2019s when SHE should\u2019ve said no. Because it\u2019s her body and her choice. Instead of quietly saying \u201cyes\u201d then, when the guy buys her drinks, instead of saying \u201cno thanks\u201d she lets him. Then when the guy asks for her number, SHE GIVES IT TO HIM. None of that was OP\u2019s fault. 3 different opportunities to say no but she kept looking at him like she was a child instead of speaking for herself. She was playing games \u201coh I wanted to see if you would claim me.\u201d Fucking BS."]}
