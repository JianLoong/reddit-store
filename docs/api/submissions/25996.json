That\u2019s a pretty non-descriptive word for a pretty important part of the story.\n\nYou know you\u2019re bad with money, you admit you were in a bad mood, you avoid telling us what it is she said exactly. You committed to paying the majority of your monthly expenses SPECIFICALLY to accommodate YOUR lifestyle, and what you do is throw \u201cstop being poor\u201d in her face the second she disagrees with your decisions.

What are you going to do if something happens to the job or to your dad's company?  You've had years to sock away a good chunk of your money into savings yet your haven't done so.  The sun doesn't shine forever - you need to start being responsible financially.  Sounds like your GF is trying to help you better prepare.

YTA.", "I\u2019m probably going to get downvoted for this but YTA. You are in this position by nepotism. It sounds like she has a more realistic view on money and wants to help you get a grip on your finances. By your own admission you are bad at saving money and accustomed to a \u201ccertain lifestyle\u201d. There are no securities in life. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to plan ahead and safe. Her \u201cnagging\u201d may very well be her looking out for you.", "YTA\n\nI had \\*exactly\\* this conversation with my now ex. I earned 90% of the household income, I paid 100% of the bills. I paid all vacations, bought her car, everything. At some point she started to try to tell me how to spend money, what to do to earn more, etc. I wasn't having any of it. I did end up lashing out at her, saying pretty much what you did, which I think made me an AH because she couldn't have paid \"her share\" no matter what and that her inability pay her share was not her fault, but mine, because I insisted on an expensive lifestyle, not her and she stayed at home and occasionally worked P/T, which, actually made it easier for me to earn more.\n\nAnyway, we broke up, mostly over that issue and it took me about 6 years and having my current partner (an attorney) lay into me very hard to see what a jerk I had been before about money. Now I see it that what I earn is to be shared. However you mutually agree to share it is up to you and your partner. But at that point that is the agreement.", "Hmmm YTA. \n\nIf you are bad with money. Its prob worth listening to her.", "You have been together for 4 years and clearly live together. Your girlfriend is most likely looking to the future and thinking about what that might look like. At your ages and having been together for that long I would think you should be having conversations about marriage, buying a house, having kids, etc. If this the conversation she was trying to have or start then yep YTA. You should be having money conversations about your future goals, how you plan to achieve them, how much each person will contribute, etc. The fact that you see it as your money and you don\u2019t seem to see what you have with her as a partnership is not a great start. If she got pregnant and needs to stay at home with the child do you expect to control all the finances even though you admit it\u2019s not your strong point? \n\nYou talk about living a certain lifestyle and not being good at saving I think you probably need to start thinking more about your long term future goals and that is probably all she was trying to start a conversation about. If you see this being a long term relationship you need to stop thinking in terms of your money or her money and start thinking as a team and also start talking about what your long term plans are as a couple and how you plan to achieve them.", "YTA for the wording \"fair share\". If your lifestyle is expensive because you want to have it that way, it's fair that you pay a lion's share.", "Shes not asking you to spend it on her, she\u2019s concerned because you\u2019re being a little reckless when it comes to finances. Nothing is guaranteed, what happens if the company goes under, or, God forbid something happens to your dad and your job disappears? Do you have at least 6 months of living expenses saved as a buffer while you job search? Time to grow up, apologize and go talk to a good money manager.", "Is she actually nagging or saying it out of concern? I\u2019m going with YTA because it sounds like she\u2019s just looking out for you.", "Where does your girlfriend's money go. Does she save any?", "Nta if she has a problem she can start to contribute to the household costs", "Info: What kind of nagging is she doing?\n\nI mean it's one thing to practically nag for the sake of nagging and another thing if she is trying to help you saving up a little bit for retirement, downpayment on a house or other important stuff.", ">I was pretty moody that day and ended up lashing out and the argument ended with me saying she can start telling me what to do with my own money when she starts paying her fair share.\n\nYTA. You say yourself you were moody and lashef out. \n\nSo, no she doesn't have a right to tell you what to do with your money. \nBut you don't have a right to throw the living arrangements in her face. It sounds like this is a decision you were initially happy with and wanted. So don't use that against her, it's a shitty thing to do. \n\nNow....you're in a partnership, assuming you're aiming to stay together long term, maybe even get married and potentially have kids one day. So, the fact you cannot save money is something she has a right to want to have a discussion about. Although it sounds like she may have gone about it the wrong way with nagging, although it's hard to know without actual conversation breakdown. \n\nMoney is often a difficult topic for many, but ultimately when you're in a long term relationship, you do start making financial decisions together, savings are important. So rather than throw it in her face that you make more money and pay more because of that, be open to have an actual adult conversation about how you manage money and your financial plans long term, that's including a conversation about her share of paying towards bills, house etc, if the current agreement is no longer working you talk about it like an adult.", "YTA.\n\nGiven how you got your job and what you make it\u2019s entirely possible she knows more about managing money than you do.\n\nYou might do well to listen to her since how easy life is for you may not last.", "Oh I was coming here so much for N T A but WTF.\n\nSo you are a golden child who is probably much overpaid bc you are daddy\u00b4s boy. Congrats on that \"achievement\". Otherwise I cannot see how you make \"10x more money\" than a person same age (as long as she\u00b4s no full time student and works 10hrs/months on minimum wage).\n\nAnd having a high income doesn\u00b4t free you from saving up. Also with a monthly income of 10k you can end up living from paycheck to paycheck if you spend unreasonable amounts. And you indeed sound like you do. It\u00b4s good for your girlfriend (who probably want to save, but can\u00b4t due to her income) to be resonable with money. Just because you currently pay the lion share doesn\u00b4t mean she is not allowed an opinion, if you behave stupid.\n\nEsp. if you plan a future together, what one could assume after 4 years, it will be your mutual problem, once she\u00dfs gonna be a SAHM.\n\nYTA.", "NTA. Time to move on bud.", "NTA. She works but does not contribute. She does not get a say on how you spend or save since you pay her bills too.", "Wow a nepo baby doesn't know how to function when his money doesn't talk. A tale as old as time. YTA. You guys are presumably in a partnership. Unless she also has a rich daddy, she's never making as much as you. Will this be your go-to to control arguments, or are you gonna learn from this?", "YTA. This woman should not ever marry you and definitely never be a stay at home parent with you unless she wants your financial advantages thrown in her face as a means to keep her quiet for the rest of her life. Also, you don't really earn that money you waste.", "Soft YTA\n\nYou seem in acknowledgement of the facts yet want to use them against her when able. If you aren't happy with the situation you can ask to change it. Blaming someone for your decisions you made together is just wrong.\n\nYou haven't provided context to why she earns 10x less also. Is she still studying or something?\n\n>Now she seems really hurt even though i assured her that i dont really care about how much she earns and that i just misspoke in anger.\n\nAlso this is literally not an excuse.

This is a classic case of \"my money is my money, your money is our money.\"", "Eh, a soft YTA. \nShe has every right to feel hurt, especially if she feels insecure about how much money she makes if you make that much more than her and pay the bills. I know what you said was said out of anger, but that doesn\u2019t make it hurt any less. Words can cut very deep no matter the intention.", "NTA. It's your money. These same people calling you an asshole would tell your GF you are a leech and controlling if she was here asking this question. \n\nUntil you are married, what's yours is yours, and what's hers is hers.", "NTA. You didn't want her for 50% bill share. You let her know that you are managing most of your money and hence you're deciding how to spend. It's your money of course and if she advises you, you show to not care for her advice then not a big deal and I wish she understands your actual meaning", "NTA your money not hers it's upto you how you spend it. Would be different if you were married tho", "YTA. If you don\u2019t want her nagging you about finances, *don\u2019t move in together*.", "NTA. Obvious shit test. Start making her pay half so you can save and see what happens.\n\nShe fucks you partly because you have these means and you do what you want. Don't stop doing either if you want it to continue.", ">i assured her that i dont really care about how much she earns and that i just misspoke in anger.\n\nEven you know YTA. How do you intend to build a life and a family with your girlfriend long term if you don't know how to manage your money? How do you expect her to want to try it with you? 4 years is enough time to start thinking about next steps, and so far it doesn't look like you're worth sticking around for.", "Soft YTA. I think some people are fixating on the fact that you're a nepo baby and calling you an AH for that. To be clear, I think you're an AH because you admit that you aren't good with money which suggests you probably do overspend. If you intend to marry and have a future with this person, I think them raising the issue isn't outlandish. You don't have to change the way you spend, but there was no reason to snap at her and throw her lower earning potential in her face. Making her feel bad about how little she makes and not contributing as much to bills is a pretty awful thing to do.", "YTA. When daddy stops coddling you or the money otherwise runs out, real life will hit you fast and you will bitterly regret being such an AH to someone who tried to protect you from your own incompetence and lack of forethought. I bet either your father doesn\u2019t know how silly you\u2019re acting with his money, or he is just tired and disappointed. And be clear - its daddy\u2019s money, not yours. Your dad is paying your bills. Nepo babies are never worth even one percent of the pocket money their parents given them for playing at their fake job.", "YTA", "Yta.  If you didn't mean it at least a little bit, you wouldn't have said that.  You say you don't care about her not paying the bills, and yet you used that as ammunition during an argument.  Of course she is now hurt and resentful, gee who have thought?  Yta, big time.  If you end up marrying this woman, your finances are her finances and that's how it's going to be.  Either get used to it or get used to staying aingle.", ">Now she seems really hurt even though i assured her that i dont really care about how much she earns and that i just misspoke in anger.\r  \n\r\n\nYTA. If your GF is nagging you about spending money, in this situation it seems to be because she's starting to think of you as a long-term couple and think of your house as a home and a household. What you're telling her by separating things so sharply - this is *my* money, that's *your* bills - is you're not a team. She's thinking future, family, kids, yes? A husband who cannot save is a detriment to a family. Just as a wife in that situation would be too if roles were reversed. Of course I'd be upset in your GF's position. You have told her something you didn't mean to tell her. You've told her after 4 years, you're not a team. You're still not a household. It's *your* money and *her* money, and *your* decisions and *her* decisions. \n\nYou earn 10x what your GF does. Great. As you said, it's cos you got lucky. You won the family lottery. Congrats. Good for you. You didn't earn that luck. You can appreciate, but you can't pretend you're entitled to your position. \n\nIF you want to have a partnership with your GF, if you're serious about her, then yeah YWBTA to say she shouldn't have a say in how you save money. Just as a wife would be if the roles were reversed. This is a household, not a your money and her money thing. It's a joint decision. If she wasn't pulling her weight, was lazy, or whatever, that's a different story. But from what you've said, you behaved like an asshole but don't seem to realise why...", "This shouldn\u2019t be a problem, but most women are insane and can\u2019t handle the truth especially when it comes to money situations. It is what it is. You are not the asshole but you *will* be the asshole if you do.", "I'm not able to say if you're the asshole or not, simply due to a lack of information.\n\nIf she was truly nagging and wanting you to change your lifestyle, then she's the asshole.\n\nIf it was minor things that could allow you to put some more money aside, invest it, then you're the asshole.", "YTA.  It sounds to me like you were born on third base and are acting like you hit a triple to get there.  And it sounds to me like she can relate to a concern that one\u2019s fortunes can go sideways so it may be best to save and invest some just in case \u2014 but you can\u2019t imagine the good times can stop rolling because, again, born on third base.", "Soft YTA.

What did I miss here?", "Well, that's a nice thing to say. Fingers crossed that if you do get married, the ceremony does that instant magic and she suddenly goes from someone who isn't allowed to even have a conversation to someone who has an equal say!", "You didn't understand what I was writing.\n\nSaying sorry is an admission that you were an AH. Don't try and justify yourself because you apologised.", "OP, we have extremely limited info but from the outside it honestly seems like she is trying to protect you from yourself and from the less pleasant realities of life. You should listen to her, it doesn't seem like she's trying to control you or take more for herself. \n\nYou are in a good position earnings-wise, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. This is not guaranteed to continue, plan for the possibility of income being interrupted/diminished, or hell even just the fact that having cash on hand for things like a home or other big purchases can make your future much much **much smoother.** Apologize more genuinely, admit fault, and ask her to help you save.", "He respectfully told her 2 times (op didn't mention that in post but did in a comment) that not want to talk about this rn I'm not in good mood for that. She still kept bringing the topic as if she had right on his money. Of course finances should be discussed but it wasn't big deal to let it go for a moment specially when it's not your money being spent.", "Do you have any type of retirement account? Is it wisely invested? Are you putting enough in it to continue your current lifestyle once you retire? What about an additional savings for a down payment on a house? If not, I'm betting that's what her \"problem\" is.", "But it is his money. She is putting nothing towards it but has her own money.", "i just wasnt feeling like talking about it right now since i just wasnt feeling like having that conversation currently", "Why the hell is he supposed to not talk at the moment she was nagging. He can ditch the topic for another day. You feminists are crazy", "Yes I\u2019m good at making money not having said money saved", "Where is her money in all of this? Why is she worried about his? She is fully supported.", "Why is it so bad he works in his DAD's company? If dad was a big cheese in a conglomerate, and he hired his son over another better qualified applicant - then you can scream Nepotism! Are you all mad? If OP wants to \"waste\" his money while he is single - that's his business. Is girlfriend suffering while he spends in a \"frivolous\" manner? Doesn't seem so at all. Future plans should and probably would be discussed  before long term plans are made.", "why would anyone care how i got hired if i increase the companies growth after being hired", "And?????", "i work in construction my degree is finance", "It has nothing to do with him taking the financial burden, it has to do with him having zero idea about how to manage money. You are right, it really isn't unexpected that an idiot who has had everything handed to them wouldn't understand how the world works.", "The issue is getting angry about this in the first place though.

But after 4 years, it's normal that people look at the long term prospects of a relationship. In that context his money skills, or lack thereof, are extremely concerning, so obviously she's concerned about that.", "And it seems you don\u2019t feel like answering my questions about the full picture, either.\n\nYou\u2019re comfortable spending money left and right but you don\u2019t want to discuss the responsibility of that spending. After four years your girlfriend is probably considering a future with you and I don\u2019t blame her for recognizing this problem. You have to understand that you\u2019re in a massive position of power here - you\u2019re fine with her depending on you financially but only as long as she doesn\u2019t get a word in. It doesn\u2019t look good for you.", "Defintely YTA", "Lol what?

You really are so very clueless.", "My dude you\u2019re all over this thread bragging about how you\u2019ve \u201cgrown the business\u201d and you\u2019re in construction? A field in which *every* business has grown exponentially due to supply shortages in the last 5 years?\n\nReality is going to hit you hard if you don\u2019t have this cushy job one day. Do yourself a favor and stop spending like the guys in the oil business making great money for a short period of time. The windfall isn\u2019t going to last forever, and your hubris will be your undoing. Save for your future and retirement.

How is op yta. Dont understand how nepotism somehow makes him an asshole.", "other than what it would cost for expenses on the month i use everything else as fun budget cause i have a small emergency budget saved so im never that close from bankruptcy", "She keeps her money and worried about his.

THAT is what makes him the asshole.", "Dude, you\u2019re 27, make a small fortune that it sounds like you didn\u2019t earn, and by your own account spend nearly everything you earn. \n\nYou need a plan for the future and how you spend your money. You need it yesterday. You\u2019re living like an entitled brat, and it\u2019s childish to spend as if the money tree of your dads business will never end.", "You're an absolute moron then.\n\nYou won the nepo-baby lottery by being handed money for nothing by daddy dearest, and yet you've got absolutely nothing to actually show for it because you haven't saved a cent in 4yrs.\n\nYTA", "Yup figured it out you\u2019re an idiot.", "you are like a child", "have fun losing a gf that sounds like a decent future wife. She will leave you if you dont see the problem yourself. This lifestyle is neither sustainable nor attractive to women that are wifey material. You should really consider her concerns as valid and be thankful that she wants you to save your money and not burn it.", "you serious? If they are in a relationship where they want to possibly marry or live together its not wrong of her to talk about finances if he is spending recklessly. If he makes 10x her money of course she wont be able to pay the same amount. You kinda sound like you would be a huge dick if you had that kind of money", "You\u2019re right, but she\u2019s depending on those finances. Due to an agreement they made because OP insisted on maintaining a lifestyle that\u2019s way out of her budget. She was not the one who wanted to live big. So while it isn\u2019t her money she still gets to inquire and express concern about whether HER living situation is sustainable.", "Because he doesn't need to. What he earns is nothing compared to the value of the company. His dad will always finance him until he inherits a fortune. There is no reason for him to save up, he is just that privileged. Not to mention for the population it is better if the rich doesn't get richer and he spends his generational wealth.", "doesn\u2019t make him an asshole though? lmfao.", "Call it what it is. Purely financially, she\u2019s being carried in a life she couldn\u2019t do on her own. If she isn\u2019t saving for her own future that\u2019s on her, he\u2019s hoofing the bills and allowing for her to do that. HER future doesn\u2019t involve HIS finances when you view it objectively like this.\n\nYou do not depend on or set your financial future and your retirement or emergency nest eggs with a boyfriend or girlfriend. You do it yourself with your own income and assets. That\u2019s the bottom line.\n\nCall me old fashioned. To me that\u2019s (one of the) big fundamental difference between spousal and dating relationships.", "Sometimes shit happens. That is reason enough for him to have a good amount saved up even if he will never need it.", "...\n\nyes it does", "If they plan to stay together and get married, his finances absolutely do concern her, any children they may want to have, any property they may want to invest in together, because whatever assets they may have together in the future WILL be affected by his present money handling problems if they go unaddressed.\n\nAnd they will go unaddressed because OP refuses to talk, he admits he has a problem but he feels absolutely zero inclination to fix it, and doesn\u2019t understand that as his partner she has every right to dislike that about him. Hell, he could be horribly in debt without her knowing, which is not something you should be able to say about a boyfriend of FOUR years.\n\nThat\u2019s where the issue is and where my entire point is. Not in his money. It\u2019s HIS money, I agree wholeheartedly. But like it or not, OP created a situation where she depends on that money being there. He insisted on an expensive lifestyle that she cannot have without him. He can\u2019t have that and then act like his money is of no concern to her.", "Spot fucking on! It is absolutely *THE* difference imo.\n\nMy wife and I make financial plans together because we are a family making a life with each. She therefore gets a say in how I spend my cash and I get a say in hers. Not the final word but we do have the right to weigh in\n\nBefore we got married?

And she has been doing that for FOUR years.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to date someone, be given what amounts to gifts by them, and then question their finances as you somehow blame them for you now being dependent on it. **Those gifts and/or those funds are not to be considered as an expectation on your part to begin with.** \n\nThat\u2019s a bullshit take you are trying to put out there, and that is exactly my point. She isn\u2019t a spouse, in short. Period.", "Yes, but watch the downvotes I get for speaking obvious truth, haha! Angry girlfriends I guess. \u201cHow dare this guy spend his cash, or not, how he wants when he isn\u2019t married\u201d\u2026 I don\u2019t get it but I\u2019ll bet right now I\u2019m downvoted like mad!"]}
