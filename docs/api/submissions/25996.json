That\u2019s a pretty non-descriptive word for a pretty important part of the story.\n\nYou know you\u2019re bad with money, you admit you were in a bad mood, you avoid telling us what it is she said exactly. You committed to paying the majority of your monthly expenses SPECIFICALLY to accommodate YOUR lifestyle, and what you do is throw \u201cstop being poor\u201d in her face the second she disagrees with your decisions.

What are you going to do if something happens to the job or to your dad's company?  You've had years to sock away a good chunk of your money into savings yet your haven't done so.  The sun doesn't shine forever - you need to start being responsible financially.  Sounds like your GF is trying to help you better prepare.

YTA.", "I\u2019m probably going to get downvoted for this but YTA. You are in this position by nepotism. It sounds like she has a more realistic view on money and wants to help you get a grip on your finances. By your own admission you are bad at saving money and accustomed to a \u201ccertain lifestyle\u201d. There are no securities in life. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to plan ahead and safe. Her \u201cnagging\u201d may very well be her looking out for you.", "YTA\n\nI had \\*exactly\\* this conversation with my now ex. I earned 90% of the household income, I paid 100% of the bills. I paid all vacations, bought her car, everything. At some point she started to try to tell me how to spend money, what to do to earn more, etc. I wasn't having any of it. I did end up lashing out at her, saying pretty much what you did, which I think made me an AH because she couldn't have paid \"her share\" no matter what and that her inability pay her share was not her fault, but mine, because I insisted on an expensive lifestyle, not her and she stayed at home and occasionally worked P/T, which, actually made it easier for me to earn more.\n\nAnyway, we broke up, mostly over that issue and it took me about 6 years and having my current partner (an attorney) lay into me very hard to see what a jerk I had been before about money. Now I see it that what I earn is to be shared. However you mutually agree to share it is up to you and your partner. But at that point that is the agreement.", "Hmmm YTA. \n\nIf you are bad with money. Its prob worth listening to her.", "You have been together for 4 years and clearly live together. Your girlfriend is most likely looking to the future and thinking about what that might look like. At your ages and having been together for that long I would think you should be having conversations about marriage, buying a house, having kids, etc. If this the conversation she was trying to have or start then yep YTA. You should be having money conversations about your future goals, how you plan to achieve them, how much each person will contribute, etc. The fact that you see it as your money and you don\u2019t seem to see what you have with her as a partnership is not a great start. If she got pregnant and needs to stay at home with the child do you expect to control all the finances even though you admit it\u2019s not your strong point? \n\nYou talk about living a certain lifestyle and not being good at saving I think you probably need to start thinking more about your long term future goals and that is probably all she was trying to start a conversation about. If you see this being a long term relationship you need to stop thinking in terms of your money or her money and start thinking as a team and also start talking about what your long term plans are as a couple and how you plan to achieve them.", "YTA for the wording \"fair share\". If your lifestyle is expensive because you want to have it that way, it's fair that you pay a lion's share.", "Shes not asking you to spend it on her, she\u2019s concerned because you\u2019re being a little reckless when it comes to finances. Nothing is guaranteed, what happens if the company goes under, or, God forbid something happens to your dad and your job disappears? Do you have at least 6 months of living expenses saved as a buffer while you job search? Time to grow up, apologize and go talk to a good money manager.", "Is she actually nagging or saying it out of concern? I\u2019m going with YTA because it sounds like she\u2019s just looking out for you.", "Where does your girlfriend's money go. Does she save any?", "Nta if she has a problem she can start to contribute to the household costs", "Info: What kind of nagging is she doing?\n\nI mean it's one thing to practically nag for the sake of nagging and another thing if she is trying to help you saving up a little bit for retirement, downpayment on a house or other important stuff.", ">I was pretty moody that day and ended up lashing out and the argument ended with me saying she can start telling me what to do with my own money when she starts paying her fair share.\n\nYTA. You say yourself you were moody and lashef out. \n\nSo, no she doesn't have a right to tell you what to do with your money. \nBut you don't have a right to throw the living arrangements in her face. It sounds like this is a decision you were initially happy with and wanted. So don't use that against her, it's a shitty thing to do. \n\nNow....you're in a partnership, assuming you're aiming to stay together long term, maybe even get married and potentially have kids one day. So, the fact you cannot save money is something she has a right to want to have a discussion about. Although it sounds like she may have gone about it the wrong way with nagging, although it's hard to know without actual conversation breakdown. \n\nMoney is often a difficult topic for many, but ultimately when you're in a long term relationship, you do start making financial decisions together, savings are important. So rather than throw it in her face that you make more money and pay more because of that, be open to have an actual adult conversation about how you manage money and your financial plans long term, that's including a conversation about her share of paying towards bills, house etc, if the current agreement is no longer working you talk about it like an adult.", "YTA.\n\nGiven how you got your job and what you make it\u2019s entirely possible she knows more about managing money than you do.\n\nYou might do well to listen to her since how easy life is for you may not last.", "Oh I was coming here so much for N T A but WTF.\n\nSo you are a golden child who is probably much overpaid bc you are daddy\u00b4s boy. Congrats on that \"achievement\". Otherwise I cannot see how you make \"10x more money\" than a person same age (as long as she\u00b4s no full time student and works 10hrs/months on minimum wage).\n\nAnd having a high income doesn\u00b4t free you from saving up. Also with a monthly income of 10k you can end up living from paycheck to paycheck if you spend unreasonable amounts. And you indeed sound like you do. It\u00b4s good for your girlfriend (who probably want to save, but can\u00b4t due to her income) to be resonable with money. Just because you currently pay the lion share doesn\u00b4t mean she is not allowed an opinion, if you behave stupid.\n\nEsp. if you plan a future together, what one could assume after 4 years, it will be your mutual problem, once she\u00dfs gonna be a SAHM.\n\nYTA.", "NTA. Time to move on bud.", "NTA. She works but does not contribute. She does not get a say on how you spend or save since you pay her bills too.", "Wow a nepo baby doesn't know how to function when his money doesn't talk. A tale as old as time. YTA. You guys are presumably in a partnership. Unless she also has a rich daddy, she's never making as much as you. Will this be your go-to to control arguments, or are you gonna learn from this?", "YTA. This woman should not ever marry you and definitely never be a stay at home parent with you unless she wants your financial advantages thrown in her face as a means to keep her quiet for the rest of her life. Also, you don't really earn that money you waste.", "Soft YTA\n\nYou seem in acknowledgement of the facts yet want to use them against her when able. If you aren't happy with the situation you can ask to change it. Blaming someone for your decisions you made together is just wrong.\n\nYou haven't provided context to why she earns 10x less also. Is she still studying or something?\n\n>Now she seems really hurt even though i assured her that i dont really care about how much she earns and that i just misspoke in anger.\n\nAlso this is literally not an excuse.

This is a classic case of \"my money is my money, your money is our money.\"", "Eh, a soft YTA. \nShe has every right to feel hurt, especially if she feels insecure about how much money she makes if you make that much more than her and pay the bills. I know what you said was said out of anger, but that doesn\u2019t make it hurt any less. Words can cut very deep no matter the intention.", "NTA. It's your money. These same people calling you an asshole would tell your GF you are a leech and controlling if she was here asking this question. \n\nUntil you are married, what's yours is yours, and what's hers is hers.", "NTA. You didn't want her for 50% bill share. You let her know that you are managing most of your money and hence you're deciding how to spend. It's your money of course and if she advises you, you show to not care for her advice then not a big deal and I wish she understands your actual meaning", "NTA your money not hers it's upto you how you spend it. Would be different if you were married tho", "YTA. If you don\u2019t want her nagging you about finances, *don\u2019t move in together*.", "NTA. Obvious shit test. Start making her pay half so you can save and see what happens.\n\nShe fucks you partly because you have these means and you do what you want. Don't stop doing either if you want it to continue.", ">i assured her that i dont really care about how much she earns and that i just misspoke in anger.\n\nEven you know YTA. How do you intend to build a life and a family with your girlfriend long term if you don't know how to manage your money? How do you expect her to want to try it with you? 4 years is enough time to start thinking about next steps, and so far it doesn't look like you're worth sticking around for.", "Soft YTA. I think some people are fixating on the fact that you're a nepo baby and calling you an AH for that. To be clear, I think you're an AH because you admit that you aren't good with money which suggests you probably do overspend. If you intend to marry and have a future with this person, I think them raising the issue isn't outlandish. You don't have to change the way you spend, but there was no reason to snap at her and throw her lower earning potential in her face. Making her feel bad about how little she makes and not contributing as much to bills is a pretty awful thing to do.", "YTA. When daddy stops coddling you or the money otherwise runs out, real life will hit you fast and you will bitterly regret being such an AH to someone who tried to protect you from your own incompetence and lack of forethought. I bet either your father doesn\u2019t know how silly you\u2019re acting with his money, or he is just tired and disappointed. And be clear - its daddy\u2019s money, not yours. Your dad is paying your bills. Nepo babies are never worth even one percent of the pocket money their parents given them for playing at their fake job.", "YTA", "Yta.  If you didn't mean it at least a little bit, you wouldn't have said that.  You say you don't care about her not paying the bills, and yet you used that as ammunition during an argument.  Of course she is now hurt and resentful, gee who have thought?  Yta, big time.  If you end up marrying this woman, your finances are her finances and that's how it's going to be.  Either get used to it or get used to staying aingle.", ">Now she seems really hurt even though i assured her that i dont really care about how much she earns and that i just misspoke in anger.\r  \n\r\n\nYTA. If your GF is nagging you about spending money, in this situation it seems to be because she's starting to think of you as a long-term couple and think of your house as a home and a household. What you're telling her by separating things so sharply - this is *my* money, that's *your* bills - is you're not a team. She's thinking future, family, kids, yes? A husband who cannot save is a detriment to a family. Just as a wife in that situation would be too if roles were reversed. Of course I'd be upset in your GF's position. You have told her something you didn't mean to tell her. You've told her after 4 years, you're not a team. You're still not a household. It's *your* money and *her* money, and *your* decisions and *her* decisions. \n\nYou earn 10x what your GF does. Great. As you said, it's cos you got lucky. You won the family lottery. Congrats. Good for you. You didn't earn that luck. You can appreciate, but you can't pretend you're entitled to your position. \n\nIF you want to have a partnership with your GF, if you're serious about her, then yeah YWBTA to say she shouldn't have a say in how you save money. Just as a wife would be if the roles were reversed. This is a household, not a your money and her money thing. It's a joint decision. If she wasn't pulling her weight, was lazy, or whatever, that's a different story. But from what you've said, you behaved like an asshole but don't seem to realise why...", "This shouldn\u2019t be a problem, but most women are insane and can\u2019t handle the truth especially when it comes to money situations. It is what it is. You are not the asshole but you *will* be the asshole if you do.", "I'm not able to say if you're the asshole or not, simply due to a lack of information.\n\nIf she was truly nagging and wanting you to change your lifestyle, then she's the asshole.\n\nIf it was minor things that could allow you to put some more money aside, invest it, then you're the asshole.", "YTA.  It sounds to me like you were born on third base and are acting like you hit a triple to get there.  And it sounds to me like she can relate to a concern that one\u2019s fortunes can go sideways so it may be best to save and invest some just in case \u2014 but you can\u2019t imagine the good times can stop rolling because, again, born on third base.", "Soft YTA.

And it\u2019s not enough to support my future goals, I also will not take another penny from my parents. \n\nMy view on work and money has entirely changed, especially since I\u2019m learning about our economy and past crises where even those with high salaries or a lot of money can go broke depending on how they allocate it. Your girlfriend is right. Things may seem alright to you, but our economy is volatile. Regardless of that, emergencies happen and you need savings in case. You probably have never had to worry about that, and would continue to be negligent of such possibilities until they happen, as you got a good job right out of college and your dad has always been well enough off to support you if anything bad ever happened. He\u2019s always been a safety net, whether you noticed or not. Which isn\u2019t a bad thing, as long as you\u2019re aware of it and aware of the fact you need to build your own safety net, because anything could happen to him to. \n\nYour girlfriend is right. You need to save. You should be grateful to her for helping you come to this realization too. The more you look into it, and other people\u2019s struggles, the more your world view will probably change. Hopefully you never are subjected to financial instability either. But then it will DEFINITELY change. \n\nA step further: people waste a lot of shit, and spend money than they should on useless shit. People of all incomes do this, unless you\u2019re just really really poor, which sucks. I personally don\u2019t think anyone should waste money or contribute to useless, unnecessary, or often times HARMFUL products. The money, resources, time, and labor could be spent providing goods that actually service people. Instead, people buy and keep tons of expensive products, often unnecessarily expensive, over and over, to make themselves feel better. Then end up not even using most of the shit they buy. These resources could really benefit others. \n\nNot to say you aren\u2019t entitled to nice things if you work your ass off. I like nice stuff too. Especially if it\u2019s practical and helps my productivity. Shit, you want a nice ass boat so you can take some personal time, enjoy life, and have fun here and there? Buy one! I just personally don\u2019t believe one should overdo it. 5 expensive watches that suck at telling the time? I\u2019ll pass. Buying shit just to represent status? Buying multiple useful practical tools that accomplish the same thing, but only 1 or 2 ever get used by anyone? I\u2019ll pass. Not saying this is you at all.\n\nBut we have a finite number of resources on this planet, and we don\u2019t know when or if that will change. Be mindful of what you use. Save what you got. The world is a crazy place, especially at this point in time. Anything could happen at any given moment. Prepare yourself for tail risks and if you have surplus then maybe help others do the same.
