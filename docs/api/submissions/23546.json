For lack of better words, the burden isn't yours to take on. You're a kid. I mean that in no demeaning way either. You have your own stuff to deal with at that age. Have a sit down with them.

Your parents do seem to have neglected you in favour of your brothers additional needs, but I\u2019m sure your parents are also struggling too, so they\u2019re not aware of the deficiencies in how they treat you.\n\nThe best way to make them understand how you feel now isn\u2019t to continue the argument: you need to show them you\u2019re considering this maturely and also fairly, while not letting them off the hook. You deserve to have those lessons, but it could be there are financial problems you don\u2019t know about which aren\u2019t your fault, but might be impacting your parent\u2019s decision making.\n\nCalmly, and carefully write them a long letter. Not accusing them, but explaining your perspective; how you love your brothers, but you are often overlooked for them. Missed holidays and birthdays, activities which aren\u2019t for you, and now the most important thing which for you is your escape, your music. Tell them you understand that caring for your brothers is hard but you\u2019re their child too and you need their support, not to be a parent to your older siblings or sacrifice the one thing that makes you feel happy because of them. Be understanding, show your maturity, show that you understand their perspective, but ask them to please consider that you matter too. It may be easier for both them and you to have it written down first, then have a conversation afterwards \n\nGood luck!\n\nEDIT to add: as other people have said, you are too young to be put in sole charge of two adults with disabilities. If your parents genuinely think this is reasonable, you might need to start looking for support for young carers, and tell them that you will have to do that because you don\u2019t feel able to provide care for 2 adults alone (you shouldn\u2019t have to: it\u2019s too much to expect at your age)", "NTA.

If your brothers need more care than your parents can provide they need social services, not making you another parent!", "Try to see if there are any free-of-charge organizations in your country that can help with this, it is not OK what your parents are doing, having a disabled child can't excuse paying attention to needs either physically but also emotionally, especially if you chose to have another child.\n\nOn the one hand, one could feel sorry for your parents to be dealing with this situation, but also they knowingly hose to have you OP, they should have been prepared for going the extra mile for you as well . Nobody made them have another kid if they could not handle the additional attention, love, money etc... involved. You were not born to be an unpaid special needs caregiver  (a role which one could argue is not even physically suitable for you since your brothers have the bodies of grown men and you are 15F so if they throw a tantrum or something you can be hardly expected to stop them efficiently) , you are technically child yourself ... \n\nTry looking into some stipends and possibilities for your future career as well as lodging, schools etc, I somehow don't see your parents supporting your dream and letting you leave easily as they will always need your help .\n\nNTA", "This isn't an Aita situation. Unfortunately life is sometimes difficult and we don't always get what we want or need. I fully understand your frustration. If possible, your parents need to look into respite care for your siblings. Depending on where you live it may be an option based on disability programs and medical insurance. I don't know that it's a factor, but music lessons are also incredibly expensive and their budget may be getting tighter if they need you to pitch in with care as well. They also need to try and meet your needs, and remember your bday. Having 2 special needs kids (even adult ones, maybe especially adult ones) is a level of stress and worry that many don't understand. It's all consuming at times. They shouldn't neglect giving you attention, but it sounds like they meet your needs but not your wants. It's hard for me to call them aholes; they likely see you as more mature than you are because you aren't disabled and are therefore able to do more for yourself even if you're still a kid. It would be good to try and sit down with them and talk about your feelings and what you'd like from them when you're calmer. You may not be able to take 2 different music lessons, but maybe they can keep you in 1 and get some outside help for your siblings. Best of luck; I know this is a difficult situation.", "I'll start with this: ESH. \n\nYour family situation is not the most ideal, you parents were dealt a tough hand. I'm not sure that your approach was the best HOWEVER, when it comes to your situation you're NTA. \n\nYour parents burden is not yours, but currently your not an adult and they are paying for all of your expenses. Did you explain to them how you felt about the music lessons? I don't think you're being childish by wanting what you want and maybe they are being unreasonable with their expectations but I would maybe bring it up again but try a different approach, maybe work it with them as a work reward or something.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I was the eighteen year old who was so stressed that I gave myself ulcer after ulcer, ended up in the hospital at least three dozen times, dehydrated, exhausted, not having been able to eat in a week, my veins collapsing. The eighteen year old who not only had to take care of my siblings, but spent every day taking care of my grandmother until she died. I was the nineteen year old who wanted so desperately to get away that ai left home with a boyfriend and ended up homeless, jobless and carless, with my addict of a boyfriend getting me pregnant and beating me, causing a miscarriage. Say something now. Tell them the truth now. Don't let them convince you they're going to treat you better and then slowly slip back into old habits, either. Make time to have friends. Make time to have hobbies. Make time to get ready for a career. Make time for yourself and make them realize that you NEED that. It's not selfish. It's not awful. It doesn't make you an asshole. Your life isn't supposed to be about spending every second of every day waiting on others. Your life isn't supposed to be about just surviving so others can live. Stand up for yourself. If you're like me, you're going to feel guilty at first. But let me tell you.. when I left my mom, she didn't have the choice to rely on me anymore. I taught the kids enough to live without me even if she stopped taking care of them, so I knew they would be okay, and my brother called me any time he needed help. I was scared she was going to relapse. But she didn't. She broke up with my sisters dad, who she's been on and off with for years who has a history of being abusive too. They sat down and had an adult conversation with each other. They communicate now. They co-parent. My mom bought a house. They're doing better. You deserve to have a life. If your parents continue to depend more and more on you, you're going to wake up one day having graduated, wanting to start a career...and they're going to be asking you to work your schedule around theirs to babysit.

It's simply not safe to leave a young girl with two older men who have no concept of self control.", "Enlist the support of a trusted adult to help navigate this situation and help discuss options with parents.  The 15 yr old would likely be placed in foster care too. I'm not saying authorities shouldn't be involved ever, but it would make more sense to explore other options first.\n\nThe parents are likely too deep in the weeds to see their other options. They need help and guidance. An outside viewpoint could do wonders for everyone", "I find it hard to believe that the family knows and utilizes a specialized camp for adults with these issues but somehow doesn't know about ANY other resource available to them? That doesn't track for me regardless of the general shittyness of the system.\nEdited to add: availability could be the reason, I won't argue that angle as you could very well be right.", "They are obviously not outside of the disabled community- they have had 25 years to figure out a better solution then to ruin their childs life", "The next time your parents call you childish, remind them that you are indeed a child.\n\nWhile I can empathize with your parents about how difficult it is to have two high needs children, they willingly had a third when they knew how high the needs were. You don't deserve to be forgotten and to become your brothers' minder.", "[removed]", "Read the rest of the thread under this comment.  I acknowledged availability being a likely issues as well, I just disagree with the implications that they wouldn't KNOW what's available.", "No, but that is a concern. Shoot, my cousin wasn't violent, but he was STILL supervised by adults when around any of the younger cousins. He had no idea that he was bigger and much stronger than any of us", "PRetty much any trusted adult that isn't a relative would be obligated by law as a mandatory reporter to report this situation.", "It\u2019s significantly easier to enroll in a camp than it is to receive regular daily services. I\u2019ve worked with people who attended camp, but that was their introduction to services and they weren\u2019t able to obtain additional services until several years later. \n\nAlso, you\u2019re assuming that OP lives in a place where services like what\u2019s being discussed are available, and that\u2019s a HUGE assumption. There are special needs camps in states that have no other services for the population. Alabama is such a state as they are just now starting to offer services to individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, yet Camp ASCAA was founded in 1976. \n\nI\u2019m not justifying OP\u2019s parents\u2019 actions, I\u2019m just pointing out that obtaining services to provide for and support individuals with disabilities is not easy, quick, and/or available for all folks, as much as it should be.", "Pretty sure they only had another child to take care of the disabled ones.", "Where did I say they were? Also, you\u2019re completely overlooking the fact that not all states or countries even offer services that would benefit this family in the ways that they need. I\u2019m not excusing OP\u2019s parents\u2019 decisions, just pointing out that the assumption that services are readily available to every person with a disability is largely inaccurate.", "Then let that be on the adult, not the child. It is not a decision a child is capable of making. A family member could sit down with the parents and have an adult conversation.", "I conceded (in an edit) that it could be availability. I was primarily arguing your point of them having no knowledge of services. THAT part doesn't track. Because as you said yourself, camp is often the introduction to other services. So giving them an out of \"not knowing\" doesn't work to me. Not being AVAILABLE, obviously not their fault. I just don't think, from the story we've been told, that they deserve the benefit of the doubt on KNOWING what's available.", "Seems pretty likely yeah, if it was an intentional pregnancy especially.", "You think someone who has had two children with disabilities would intentionally have a third chance hoping to have a neurotypical child to be caregiver once they\u2019re older? \n\nYou really think a family is going to risk having a third child with disabilities in attempts of giving birth to a health child for the sole purpose of caring for their siblings once they\u2019re all adults? \n\nWhile I admit this could be a possibility, the odds of it are extremely, extremely slim. In my 40+ years experience living and/or working with individuals with disabilities, I\u2019ve never encountered this once.", "I like how we're just assuming she has family willing to do this despite the fact that any family she has has watched this dynamic go on for years and done nothing.", "Working in this field, I always give people the benefit of the doubt until given a reason not to do so. I will 100% concede that there are families who refuse services for their children with disabilities. Some refuse to get their children diagnosed so they can be deemed eligible for services, and some families refuse services even after their children have been diagnosed and deemed eligible for them. Some are afraid of the stigmas that come with some diagnoses, especially Autism, and some feel they are capable caregivers on their own. That very likely could be the case with OP\u2019s family, but we can\u2019t assume that it is. Honestly, without knowing at least the state they\u2019re in, it\u2019s hard to know for sure whether availability is an issue or not.", "It could be anyone. There is bound to be one adult close to the situation who could give her better guidance than Reddit. \n\nSome people on reddit are so quick to say \"call CPS,\" without understanding the true implications of that action. It is a big action. Once those wheels are in motion, there is no going back. \n\nThis family needs help, not legal actions."]}
