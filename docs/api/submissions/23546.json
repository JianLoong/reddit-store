For lack of better words, the burden isn't yours to take on. You're a kid. I mean that in no demeaning way either. You have your own stuff to deal with at that age. Have a sit down with them.

Your parents do seem to have neglected you in favour of your brothers additional needs, but I\u2019m sure your parents are also struggling too, so they\u2019re not aware of the deficiencies in how they treat you.\n\nThe best way to make them understand how you feel now isn\u2019t to continue the argument: you need to show them you\u2019re considering this maturely and also fairly, while not letting them off the hook. You deserve to have those lessons, but it could be there are financial problems you don\u2019t know about which aren\u2019t your fault, but might be impacting your parent\u2019s decision making.\n\nCalmly, and carefully write them a long letter. Not accusing them, but explaining your perspective; how you love your brothers, but you are often overlooked for them. Missed holidays and birthdays, activities which aren\u2019t for you, and now the most important thing which for you is your escape, your music. Tell them you understand that caring for your brothers is hard but you\u2019re their child too and you need their support, not to be a parent to your older siblings or sacrifice the one thing that makes you feel happy because of them. Be understanding, show your maturity, show that you understand their perspective, but ask them to please consider that you matter too. It may be easier for both them and you to have it written down first, then have a conversation afterwards \n\nGood luck!\n\nEDIT to add: as other people have said, you are too young to be put in sole charge of two adults with disabilities. If your parents genuinely think this is reasonable, you might need to start looking for support for young carers, and tell them that you will have to do that because you don\u2019t feel able to provide care for 2 adults alone (you shouldn\u2019t have to: it\u2019s too much to expect at your age)", "NTA.

If your brothers need more care than your parents can provide they need social services, not making you another parent!", "Try to see if there are any free-of-charge organizations in your country that can help with this, it is not OK what your parents are doing, having a disabled child can't excuse paying attention to needs either physically but also emotionally, especially if you chose to have another child.\n\nOn the one hand, one could feel sorry for your parents to be dealing with this situation, but also they knowingly hose to have you OP, they should have been prepared for going the extra mile for you as well . Nobody made them have another kid if they could not handle the additional attention, love, money etc... involved. You were not born to be an unpaid special needs caregiver  (a role which one could argue is not even physically suitable for you since your brothers have the bodies of grown men and you are 15F so if they throw a tantrum or something you can be hardly expected to stop them efficiently) , you are technically child yourself ... \n\nTry looking into some stipends and possibilities for your future career as well as lodging, schools etc, I somehow don't see your parents supporting your dream and letting you leave easily as they will always need your help .\n\nNTA", "This isn't an Aita situation. Unfortunately life is sometimes difficult and we don't always get what we want or need. I fully understand your frustration. If possible, your parents need to look into respite care for your siblings. Depending on where you live it may be an option based on disability programs and medical insurance. I don't know that it's a factor, but music lessons are also incredibly expensive and their budget may be getting tighter if they need you to pitch in with care as well. They also need to try and meet your needs, and remember your bday. Having 2 special needs kids (even adult ones, maybe especially adult ones) is a level of stress and worry that many don't understand. It's all consuming at times. They shouldn't neglect giving you attention, but it sounds like they meet your needs but not your wants. It's hard for me to call them aholes; they likely see you as more mature than you are because you aren't disabled and are therefore able to do more for yourself even if you're still a kid. It would be good to try and sit down with them and talk about your feelings and what you'd like from them when you're calmer. You may not be able to take 2 different music lessons, but maybe they can keep you in 1 and get some outside help for your siblings. Best of luck; I know this is a difficult situation.", "I'll start with this: ESH. \n\nYour family situation is not the most ideal, you parents were dealt a tough hand. I'm not sure that your approach was the best HOWEVER, when it comes to your situation you're NTA. \n\nYour parents burden is not yours, but currently your not an adult and they are paying for all of your expenses. Did you explain to them how you felt about the music lessons? I don't think you're being childish by wanting what you want and maybe they are being unreasonable with their expectations but I would maybe bring it up again but try a different approach, maybe work it with them as a work reward or something.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The eighteen year old who not only had to take care of my siblings, but spent every day taking care of my grandmother until she died. I was the nineteen year old who wanted so desperately to get away that ai left home with a boyfriend and ended up homeless, jobless and carless, with my addict of a boyfriend getting me pregnant and beating me, causing a miscarriage. Say something now. Tell them the truth now. Don't let them convince you they're going to treat you better and then slowly slip back into old habits, either. Make time to have friends. Make time to have hobbies. Make time to get ready for a career. Make time for yourself and make them realize that you NEED that. It's not selfish. It's not awful. It doesn't make you an asshole. Your life isn't supposed to be about spending every second of every day waiting on others. Your life isn't supposed to be about just surviving so others can live. Stand up for yourself. If you're like me, you're going to feel guilty at first. But let me tell you.. when I left my mom, she didn't have the choice to rely on me anymore. I taught the kids enough to live without me even if she stopped taking care of them, so I knew they would be okay, and my brother called me any time he needed help. I was scared she was going to relapse. But she didn't. She broke up with my sisters dad, who she's been on and off with for years who has a history of being abusive too. They sat down and had an adult conversation with each other. They communicate now. They co-parent. My mom bought a house. They're doing better. You deserve to have a life. If your parents continue to depend more and more on you, you're going to wake up one day having graduated, wanting to start a career...and they're going to be asking you to work your schedule around theirs to babysit.

Cause why else would they require her to no longer go to her one activity \u201ca few evenings a week\u201d to do something she could do when she returns? That very much means solo care giver, but feel free to rewrite what she said to make her sound selfish", "Then why'd they have the third kid, if they didn't think there was a shot they'd not be disabled? Flip your argument around -- you think they had a third kid knowing that the odds were good that kid would also be severely disabled?", "No, not at all. You can try to read it that way, I don't. I ask my teenager to look after the little ones when I am busy but around all the time.", "No you deserve equal compassion", "Once he is free, he should make sure parents know he will NOT be taking care of them later in life.", "She needs to call cps as they've neglected her in favor of her brothers", "I don\u2019t know what US you are in, but it\u2019s definitely different from the one I am in.", "A lot of people mentioned that the services they need might not be available in their area/state, but another thought is that maybe there is, but they don't qualify for it. They could make just enough to be on the borderline of services being denied.", "Mom worked at a group home and one of their houses had just a guy who had SAd young women and was court ordered not to be alone. He was also violent with male aides, the only kind they had for him.", "In my job as a support worker it took 5 staff to hold down a 5\u20191, 128 pound girl in a trained restraint method when she had a tantrum. \n\nIt was absolutely terrifying when she lost it and even 5 male staff struggled to hold her. It was incredible the physical strength she had. \n\nShe was the loveliest sweetest girl and I loved working with her, but when she lost her temper she could cause serious damage.", "Op hasn\u2019t said where they\u2019re from but that type of support isn\u2019t available in many places", "I did in home care for a man in his 50s, he didn't start receiving it until his late 40s even though his family had him on all the lists  through health & welfare for ages. It wasn't until he committed a crime that he got in home funded care as a part of his parole requirements. The US, especially in poorer states, can keep you on waiting lists for benefits for years and then you die and your beneficiaries receive mail showing you were recently approved. Nonprofits and organizations have a lot out of outside funding and systems in place to do things like one week camps, short term therapy, etc. for folks because there are way less hoops to jump through. It's horrible."]}
