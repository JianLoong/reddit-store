Unfortunately you may be your parents' retirement plan to take over care of your brothers when they get to old to do so.\n\n Your life should not have to revolve around your brothers.

For lack of better words, the burden isn't yours to take on. You're a kid. I mean that in no demeaning way either. You have your own stuff to deal with at that age. Have a sit down with them.

Your parents do seem to have neglected you in favour of your brothers additional needs, but I\u2019m sure your parents are also struggling too, so they\u2019re not aware of the deficiencies in how they treat you.\n\nThe best way to make them understand how you feel now isn\u2019t to continue the argument: you need to show them you\u2019re considering this maturely and also fairly, while not letting them off the hook. You deserve to have those lessons, but it could be there are financial problems you don\u2019t know about which aren\u2019t your fault, but might be impacting your parent\u2019s decision making.\n\nCalmly, and carefully write them a long letter. Not accusing them, but explaining your perspective; how you love your brothers, but you are often overlooked for them. Missed holidays and birthdays, activities which aren\u2019t for you, and now the most important thing which for you is your escape, your music. Tell them you understand that caring for your brothers is hard but you\u2019re their child too and you need their support, not to be a parent to your older siblings or sacrifice the one thing that makes you feel happy because of them. Be understanding, show your maturity, show that you understand their perspective, but ask them to please consider that you matter too. It may be easier for both them and you to have it written down first, then have a conversation afterwards \n\nGood luck!\n\nEDIT to add: as other people have said, you are too young to be put in sole charge of two adults with disabilities. If your parents genuinely think this is reasonable, you might need to start looking for support for young carers, and tell them that you will have to do that because you don\u2019t feel able to provide care for 2 adults alone (you shouldn\u2019t have to: it\u2019s too much to expect at your age)", "NTA.

If your brothers need more care than your parents can provide they need social services, not making you another parent!", "Try to see if there are any free-of-charge organizations in your country that can help with this, it is not OK what your parents are doing, having a disabled child can't excuse paying attention to needs either physically but also emotionally, especially if you chose to have another child.\n\nOn the one hand, one could feel sorry for your parents to be dealing with this situation, but also they knowingly hose to have you OP, they should have been prepared for going the extra mile for you as well . Nobody made them have another kid if they could not handle the additional attention, love, money etc... involved. You were not born to be an unpaid special needs caregiver  (a role which one could argue is not even physically suitable for you since your brothers have the bodies of grown men and you are 15F so if they throw a tantrum or something you can be hardly expected to stop them efficiently) , you are technically child yourself ... \n\nTry looking into some stipends and possibilities for your future career as well as lodging, schools etc, I somehow don't see your parents supporting your dream and letting you leave easily as they will always need your help .\n\nNTA", "This isn't an Aita situation. Unfortunately life is sometimes difficult and we don't always get what we want or need. I fully understand your frustration. If possible, your parents need to look into respite care for your siblings. Depending on where you live it may be an option based on disability programs and medical insurance. I don't know that it's a factor, but music lessons are also incredibly expensive and their budget may be getting tighter if they need you to pitch in with care as well. They also need to try and meet your needs, and remember your bday. Having 2 special needs kids (even adult ones, maybe especially adult ones) is a level of stress and worry that many don't understand. It's all consuming at times. They shouldn't neglect giving you attention, but it sounds like they meet your needs but not your wants. It's hard for me to call them aholes; they likely see you as more mature than you are because you aren't disabled and are therefore able to do more for yourself even if you're still a kid. It would be good to try and sit down with them and talk about your feelings and what you'd like from them when you're calmer. You may not be able to take 2 different music lessons, but maybe they can keep you in 1 and get some outside help for your siblings. Best of luck; I know this is a difficult situation.", "I'll start with this: ESH. \n\nYour family situation is not the most ideal, you parents were dealt a tough hand. I'm not sure that your approach was the best HOWEVER, when it comes to your situation you're NTA. \n\nYour parents burden is not yours, but currently your not an adult and they are paying for all of your expenses. Did you explain to them how you felt about the music lessons? I don't think you're being childish by wanting what you want and maybe they are being unreasonable with their expectations but I would maybe bring it up again but try a different approach, maybe work it with them as a work reward or something.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
