You do not mention what type of disabilities your brothers have but I think leaving a 15 year old to babysit two 20 something men could be quite questionable depending on where you are and the health issues your brothers have.\n\nI'd also watch out in future.  Unfortunately you may be your parents' retirement plan to take over care of your brothers when they get to old to do so.\n\n Your life should not have to revolve around your brothers.  I could understand that money may be tight at the moment for them but they need to work out either a time frame for you to get back the lessons or some thing else.  And babysitting your brothers while you are still at an age that you are studying shouldn't be forced on you.", "NTA at all. I sympathise with your parents having two disabled children and I can only imagine the stress and such that comes with it. \n\nThat being said. You are still a child and human being with basic needs too. You have been neglected through no fault of your own. Sounds like your parents are ready to shift some of that workload/responsibility onto you too which isn't fair at all. They say it's not ideal, but it's more than not ideal. For lack of better words, the burden isn't yours to take on. You're a kid. I mean that in no demeaning way either. You have your own stuff to deal with at that age. Have a sit down with them. Air your concerns. Failing that, do you have friends/family you can go to for support? Someone that can sit with you whilst you talk it out? \n\nHopefully in the near future you resolve it and get back to your music. Wishing you all the best.

It is not your fault they require extra care. It is your parent\u2019s responsibility to provide care, not yours. Clearly your parents need a break and want you to step in so they can have a break. \n\nNTA. Please tell a trusted adult what\u2019s going on.

Taking away your piano and violin lessons in order to care for your brothers is just not right.", "The next time your parents call you childish, remind them that you are indeed a child. \n\nWhile I can empathize with your parents about how difficult it is to have two high needs children, they willingly had a third when they knew how high the needs were.

It's understandable that you feel neglected and frustrated when your parents prioritize your brothers' needs over yours. It's essential for parents to balance their attention and care among all their children. Your feelings of being overlooked are valid, especially when your music lessons were your way of escaping and finding your passion. It's essential for parents to consider your needs and interests too, and it's not unreasonable for you to express your emotions.

Your parents sound like they need help with your brothers and should not be dumping them on you. I get it must be incredibly hard caring for them,but you're still a child.

I would by the way, do exactly that.", "NTA your parents are downright neglectful and expecting you to watch your brothers is not only horribly unfair, but also might be putting you in physical danger.\nDo you have family that you can stay with? If so do it. You need to plan on getting out of your parents' house as soon as possible, and prepare to cut all contact with them. Otherwise you'll be forced to take care of your brothers for the rest of thier lives.", "NTA at all! \n\nYou can\u2019t take care of your brother at the detriment of your happiness \nHelp is great but neglect is shit", "NTA...I hate to say it but you need to get out of there.

It's unfair.", "NTA  You are a child too, you have a right to act childish. If they can't as the parents handle the care it's time for them to look into facilities that can. Anyone who tells you that you are being selfish for not doing it, tell them if they think so they can do it. Your parents can't really punish you since they've already taken the main thing you care about away, your music.

Your parents do seem to have neglected you in favour of your brothers additional needs, but I\u2019m sure your parents are also struggling too, so they\u2019re not aware of the deficiencies in how they treat you.\n\nThe best way to make them understand how you feel now isn\u2019t to continue the argument: you need to show them you\u2019re considering this maturely and also fairly, while not letting them off the hook. You deserve to have those lessons, but it could be there are financial problems you don\u2019t know about which aren\u2019t your fault, but might be impacting your parent\u2019s decision making.\n\nCalmly, and carefully write them a long letter. Not accusing them, but explaining your perspective; how you love your brothers, but you are often overlooked for them. Missed holidays and birthdays, activities which aren\u2019t for you, and now the most important thing which for you is your escape, your music. Tell them you understand that caring for your brothers is hard but you\u2019re their child too and you need their support, not to be a parent to your older siblings or sacrifice the one thing that makes you feel happy because of them. Be understanding, show your maturity, show that you understand their perspective, but ask them to please consider that you matter too. It may be easier for both them and you to have it written down first, then have a conversation afterwards \n\nGood luck!\n\nEDIT to add: as other people have said, you are too young to be put in sole charge of two adults with disabilities. If your parents genuinely think this is reasonable, you might need to start looking for support for young carers, and tell them that you will have to do that because you don\u2019t feel able to provide care for 2 adults alone (you shouldn\u2019t have to: it\u2019s too much to expect at your age)", "NTA. You are the child, and they are the parents. They decided to have another child knowing that they would be facing difficulties with your brothers. You deserve to be nurtured and loved, not turned into another carer.", "NTA. If your brothers need more care than your parents can provide they need social services, not making you another parent!", "Try to see if there are any free-of-charge organizations in your country that can help with this, it is not OK what your parents are doing, having a disabled child can't excuse paying attention to needs either physically but also emotionally, especially if you chose to have another child.\n\nOn the one hand, one could feel sorry for your parents to be dealing with this situation, but also they knowingly hose to have you OP, they should have been prepared for going the extra mile for you as well . Nobody made them have another kid if they could not handle the additional attention, love, money etc... involved. You were not born to be an unpaid special needs caregiver  (a role which one could argue is not even physically suitable for you since your brothers have the bodies of grown men and you are 15F so if they throw a tantrum or something you can be hardly expected to stop them efficiently) , you are technically child yourself ... \n\nTry looking into some stipends and possibilities for your future career as well as lodging, schools etc, I somehow don't see your parents supporting your dream and letting you leave easily as they will always need your help .\n\nNTA", "This isn't an Aita situation. Unfortunately life is sometimes difficult and we don't always get what we want or need. I fully understand your frustration. If possible, your parents need to look into respite care for your siblings. Depending on where you live it may be an option based on disability programs and medical insurance. I don't know that it's a factor, but music lessons are also incredibly expensive and their budget may be getting tighter if they need you to pitch in with care as well. They also need to try and meet your needs, and remember your bday. Having 2 special needs kids (even adult ones, maybe especially adult ones) is a level of stress and worry that many don't understand. It's all consuming at times. They shouldn't neglect giving you attention, but it sounds like they meet your needs but not your wants. It's hard for me to call them aholes; they likely see you as more mature than you are because you aren't disabled and are therefore able to do more for yourself even if you're still a kid. It would be good to try and sit down with them and talk about your feelings and what you'd like from them when you're calmer. You may not be able to take 2 different music lessons, but maybe they can keep you in 1 and get some outside help for your siblings. Best of luck; I know this is a difficult situation.", "I'll start with this: ESH. \n\nYour family situation is not the most ideal, you parents were dealt a tough hand. I'm not sure that your approach was the best HOWEVER, when it comes to your situation you're NTA. \n\nYour parents burden is not yours, but currently your not an adult and they are paying for all of your expenses. Did you explain to them how you felt about the music lessons? I don't think you're being childish by wanting what you want and maybe they are being unreasonable with their expectations but I would maybe bring it up again but try a different approach, maybe work it with them as a work reward or something.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
