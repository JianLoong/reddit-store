I [30F] work in healthcare, and this is the time of year a ton of people end up in the hospital bc of illness, s****** attempts, domestic violence, alcohol/ drug overdose, weird sex acts etc. If you want time off at my job around the holiday weeks, a month in advance is required. Taking time off without a month notice leads to serious disciplinary action up to getting fired. Also, me and my coworkers are a team, it\u2019s a dick thing to do bc that means someone is getting called in, and it\u2019s an accepted rule that we just don\u2019t do that to each other, especially around this time of year.\n\nBack in September my dad made me and my sisters aware he is now engaged. Him and his fianc\u00e9 were planning a wedding around November. I asked to be given a specific date at that moment, because it\u2019s hard to take off during this time of year, and I wanted to give my job plenty of notice.\n\nSince then, I have periodically asked for an update on the wedding date, but have never received a response. A few days ago, I was informed by my sister our dad had texted her, the wedding would be New Year\u2019s Eve. I have not heard a word from my dad since that day in September. I asked her was my attendance to be expected, and she said yes.\n\nI sent my dad another message, asking for more details about the wedding, the date, the dress code, again no response.\n\nSo I\u2019ve decided not to go. From what I can tell, me being there is no priority, and this way I won\u2019t have to miss work, or the holiday pay I desperately need. I informed my sisters and mom I would not be going, and they are saying I\u2019m being a jerk and a spoiled brat. But I gotta say, I\u2019ve been to a few weddings before, and I\u2019ve never had to chase down an invitation when my attendance is desired. \n\nSo I\u2019m wondering, AITA for skipping my dads wedding?", "created_utc": 1671280196, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zo5bjw/aita_for_skipping_my_dads_wedding/", "score": 268, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is this a normal means of non communication for him? \n\nA telephone call (which no doubt will go to voice mail) with a message like this would be appropriate.  \u201cHi dad: I understand you\u2019ve set your wedding date for New Year\u2019s Eve. I\u2019m assuming this is correct, since I\u2019m hearing it secondhand. I have checked with my work, and as I believe you know, my workplace requires at least a month\u2019s notice for holiday-season leave or I will be subject to disciplinary action. Unfortunately, I am not going to be able to attend your wedding. Please accept my best wishes, and perhaps we can celebrate the occasion in the future.\u201d", "NTA. Your father's behaviour is ludicrous. He didn't tell you about it and he hasn't even replied to you. The reactions of your sisters and mother are incomprehensible.", "NTA.

A wedding (even if your dads), isn't worth risking your job and lively hood over.  Especially if your dad can't be bothered to tell you the actual wedding date.", "NTA\n\nI would however recommend calling him, not just texting, to let him know why you won't be there; the work reason. See what he says and if he really does want you there it gives him a chance to say so.\n\nIs he close enough that you could do a shift  switch with another staff member? That way you don't lose work and holiday time.", "NTA.  You get what you give and your dad isn\u2019t giving you the literal time of day.", "NTA. You tried multiple times to get a date well in advance so that you could ask for time off. Tbh, something about this sounds sus. Your dad never got back to you on a date, and didn't even respond to details of the expectations for the wedding? I could be reading into this too much but if you've been trying to get a date from him since September, and he hasn't given you one, it seems like he either got the date last minute or was purposely ignoring you. I'd ask your sister when she found out about the wedding date, if she's even willing to answer that question.", "NTA. Your dad doesn't seem to make it a priority for you to be there so you definitely shouldn't. As for your family, they'll get over it.", "Nah, NTA tell your mom and sis you tried and he didn't... Fuck em", "NTA technically he didn\u2019t even ask you to come", "How can you be an A for not going to an event that you haven't been invited to? If your mom and sister are calling you names for NOT crashing a wedding and for NOT getting fired from your job, I'd just block them.", "NTA....OP May I share my opinion with you on how to navigate this and minimize the drama?\n\nIn my opinion you are completely correct You should not have to chase your father, who is a member of your immediate family, details of his wedding. He's absolutely in the wrong here. It's not right and it certainly not an excuse, but very often men do dumb things about weddings and even dumber things when they are \" in love \" and focused on the new romantic partner.\n\nI would not even get into the discussion of whether or not you are important to him or how he communicated with you or any reason as to why you Will not attend the wedding. Don't open yourself up to debates and drama, I would simply say this, by the time I found out the date it was too late to get the time off from work. Nobody needs to know whether that's true or not, but it's a very reasonable statement. Leave it at that. They will never be an epiphany from your father as to how he mistreated you in this situation, there doesn't need to be the drama of debating how he handled it and that you are not attending because of how you feel, your feelings are legitimate and valid but they are also subject to interpretation by others and you don't need that.\n\nYou deserve better, you deserve to be loved and cherished as a daughter, for whatever reason your father is not doing that right now, that's all about him it's not about you, remember that and move on.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
