My dad has four children with his wife and my mom has a daughter with her husband.\n\nRecently, my twin came out as gay. My older brother is bi and he's been in a relationship with a man for the past year. Our dad (48M) who's claiming that he isn't homophobic, has taken the news of my twin coming out strangely. \n\nI've always said I didn't want to have kids. Yes, I know I'm 17 and my opinion might change but right now, the whole idea just seems scary to me. My mother went to hell and back with miscarriages and i think I'm traumatized lmao. \n\nSince my twin came out, my dad has really been pressing the idea of children on to me. He's been asking me to babysit my siblings so I can see that kids 'aren't that bad' and he's been giving my long lectures on why having kids is good and important. He's insisting that this isn't because my twin came out but it's obvious that it is.\n\nHe also set me up on a date with hia friends' son that went *awful* and when I got home, I confronted him about his weird behaviour. That's where he admitted that he's worried about not having any grandchildren from his first marriage. I told him that was totally weird and absurd, mainly because why does it matter which marriage your grandchildren are coming from, and he has this weird thing about wanting my mother to stay in his life even though he cheated on her. We got into an argument and I said it was even weirder he was trying to press this on me while I'm a teenager and his excuse was that people in our family tend to have children at a young age which is true. I ended up leaving to go stay with my mom but I called him a weirdo and told him to leave me alone about all this before I left. \n\nLater on, my stepmother called me and demanded that I apologize to him. According to her, I've made him feel like a creep for being worried about something that a lot of people are naturally worried about.

And just because you want grandbabies does not mean you get to try and force your kids into a relationship", "NTA. Your father sounds like my worthless biological grandfather whose only accomplishment in life was breeding with multiple wives and watching his progeny grow. I don\u2019t talk to mine anymore because he only cared about the contents of my uterus, and you may want to consider doing the same if yours keeps it up.", "Nta you have a right to a child free life is truly your choice now I do understand where your dad's coming from about carrying on the line but if he has more children from his second marriage especially sons cuz that would pass the last name that he shouldn't be worried I think that's probably part of it.", "NTA your dad is being weird and he has no right to pressure you into having kids. \n\nYou need to live your life at your pace.", "NTA Worse than weird, losing his mind already with so many kids and you and your siblings still so young. Hopefully he controls himself soon, and who knows... maybe one of your brothers might actually want a kid in the future....but all three of you are still too young to be thinking about that. Dad needs to stop.", "NTA what father keeps trying to get their daughter laid when they don\u2019t want to", ">I've made him feel like a creep\n\nBecause he's being a creep.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - having children is a personal decision between two people in a relationship. Your dad is being absolutely creepy by trying to push pregnancy on someone that is underage. I'd keep my distance for a bit while he comes to terms with your boundary and with your brothers being gay.", "NTA if he didn't want to get called a weirdo he shouldn't have been a controlling, bordering on inappropriate, weirdo about your reproductive autonomy.", "NTA, so basically your father's trying to set you up to get pregnant because he just wants the knowledge of knowing that he has grandchildren. Your father's being a creep and I'm glad you went to stay with your mom and it sounds like you shouldn't go back to your dad's", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s pressuring you to have children so he can stay in your mom\u2019s life?? Ew. You were being polite when you called that weird. Tell your stepmom that her husband is still pinning to keep his ex-wife around. That might get her on your side and make your dad sufficiently embarrassed to knock it off.", "NTA - creepy all of it.\nBet the stepmother wouldn't be as enthusiastic if she knew it was related to keeping the first wife in his family (which is creepy and controlling). No way he explained it like that to her.", "NTA. Your dad is a controlling creep. He wants to keep himself tied to your mother (even though he\u2019s married) by pressuring his teenage daughter to have children? Ugh. This is not normal and you might want to consider going low contact with him.", "NTA: When he starts speaking of grand-kids again, tell him \"*One more word about grand-kids from my womb, and the bloodline ends with me!*\" and if he continues, just tell him that wire hangers are still a thing, and you know how to use one. He'll get the message, sooner rather than later.", "NTA.  Put some distance between you and your dad for a short while.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s always right to call out weirdos when they\u2019re being weird.  \n\nBeing gay or bisexual doesn\u2019t automatically mean your brothers can\u2019t have or don\u2019t want kids (bio or adopted), so it\u2019s weird for your father to put that pressure just on you. \n\nIt\u2019s even more weird and also incredibly alarming, creepy, stalker-like, and controlling of your dad to want grandchildren to keep your mother WHO HE CHEATED ON in his life. Genuinely not sure why he would want that. Does he feel guilty and want her to absolve him? Does he want to torment her forever? Does he want to get back with her? \n\nHonestly if you ever talk to him again every time he tries to push the idea of kids on you, respond by pushing the idea of therapy onto him.", "Yeah this right here, don't pussyfoot around it, if she tries to talk to you get frank about it, but honestly you should cut contact", "how is OP the AH?", "Yeah...on a fundamental level pushing people to have children is a roundabout way of being nosy about their sex life, so if he feels like a creep it's probably because he realized the implications of pushing a seventeen year old girl to have more sex."]}
