I have an older brother (20M) and a twin brother (17M). I have other siblings, but these are the only ones I share both parents with. My dad has four children with his wife and my mom has a daughter with her husband.\n\nRecently, my twin came out as gay. My older brother is bi and he's been in a relationship with a man for the past year. Our dad (48M) who's claiming that he isn't homophobic, has taken the news of my twin coming out strangely. \n\nI've always said I didn't want to have kids. Yes, I know I'm 17 and my opinion might change but right now, the whole idea just seems scary to me. My mother went to hell and back with miscarriages and i think I'm traumatized lmao. \n\nSince my twin came out, my dad has really been pressing the idea of children on to me. He's been asking me to babysit my siblings so I can see that kids 'aren't that bad' and he's been giving my long lectures on why having kids is good and important. He's insisting that this isn't because my twin came out but it's obvious that it is.\n\nHe also set me up on a date with hia friends' son that went *awful* and when I got home, I confronted him about his weird behaviour. That's where he admitted that he's worried about not having any grandchildren from his first marriage. I told him that was totally weird and absurd, mainly because why does it matter which marriage your grandchildren are coming from, and he has this weird thing about wanting my mother to stay in his life even though he cheated on her. We got into an argument and I said it was even weirder he was trying to press this on me while I'm a teenager and his excuse was that people in our family tend to have children at a young age which is true. I ended up leaving to go stay with my mom but I called him a weirdo and told him to leave me alone about all this before I left. \n\nLater on, my stepmother called me and demanded that I apologize to him. According to her, I've made him feel like a creep for being worried about something that a lot of people are naturally worried about. Now I feel bad and I want to know if I AITA? thanks.", "created_utc": 1669366399, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z48k8f/aita_for_telling_my_dad_to_stop_being_a_weirdo/", "score": 163, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Forget being weirdly obsessive about having grandchildren from the children of his first marriage--he's not *entitled* to grandchildren at all!

He was being weird and pushy and it's perfectly reasonable of you to have called him out on it and told him that he needs to stop.  He can be worried about this all he wants to be, as long as he keeps it to himself--which he's not doing here.  His *behavior* is what's inappropriate, and as far as that goes, he owes you the apology.\n\nIf having a relationship with your Dad is important to you, I encourage you to take some time to gather your thoughts and then sit down with him, or write him a letter if you're not comfortable doing that, where you let him know uncomfortable he's making you and specifically point out that he's pushing his *actual living child who exists right now* away with this obsession about the potential for future grandchildren.", "NTA. NOT THE ASS HOLE. Good grief. This is one of the more terrible ones I\u2019ve read in awhile when it comes to AH behavior. Is your dad still in love with your mom?

Tell him you are too young to be having this stupid conversation.", "NTA - he was being a creep. You need to tell him that the more his tries to foist the idea of motherhood onto you (when you're only 17 WTF), the less appealing it is going to seem.\n\nAlso, gay and bi people can have babies too. Adopted or IVF. So it's mildly homophobic for him to rule out your siblings...", "NTA.

Calm down, dad.", "NTA. He shouldn\u2019t be putting pressure on you like this, especially over something that\u2019s a very life changing decision, and ESPECIALLY because this is entirely about his wants and not yours.

You\u2019re completely valid in calling him out on this behavior and if anyone owes an apology, it\u2019s him to you. \n\nIf you value having a relationship with your dad, it might be helpful for you to gather your thoughts and express things similarly to how you have on here. He may be more receptive to that.

You are 17! It sounds like he is trying to convince you to be a teen mom. That is not normal dad behavior. And for someone who remarried he is way too obsessed with your mom.

That's true. You heard of \"midlife crises?\" People get stupid then, too. Faced with mortality, they get dumb. *Most* of the time, if you point out that their behaviors are hurting their loved ones, they shape up. Sometimes that doesn't work, and those guys make Reddit. But it happens often enough to be a whole phrase. And they just need to get over themselves and get their butts in gear and stop moping. Same with this guy. He's just gotta deal with it. Tough nuggies. Yelling will probably not change the behavior as quickly as showing some compassion, and the goal is to change the behavior."]}
