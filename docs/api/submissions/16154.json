You\u2019re in a quandary but tbh I don\u2019t think it would be a loss for long if she lost this friend group.  If there is a next time it needs to be clear you\u2019re only to get your gf home not every single person all over the city- not sure where you live but that could be an all night. Heck trying to get addresses from drunk people is a pain in the neck. \n\nI\u2019d go with ESH. Since you were sober you should probably have gotten all the women home and taken the hit.

You were specifically asked to go to allow your gf and her friend's a night out while feeling safe, so like, the expectation was set, but you also can't control what a cab driver does. It's hard to wrestle multiple drunk people. However, if you were able to drive one home, I'm not sure why you couldn't drive more than one home. \n\nI think your gf's viewpoint is fair - like, you could've thought this through a little more, but also they're adults and could've approached this with more responsibility.", "YTA - making a woman be alone in a strange place at night is always a terrible thing to do and you should apologise.", "YTA. It sounds like you don't understand, or care, about the danger women are in. There was a story from the UK a few years ago, about a young woman who was a few pence short of bus fare late at night. Not one person on that bus tried to help, so for lack of literally \u00a30.20 or so, she had to try to walk home. She didn't make it. Her body was discovered a few days later.\n\nIt's not about whether they're adults. It's about acknowledging that they live in a different world from you, with different risks. It's about caring about other humans.", "ESH. \n\nThey should not have gotten drunk without a plan in place for how they would get home. Even if the plan was to find a guy to hook up with and go home with them, you still need a back up plan if you don\u2019t find anyone you are interested in.\n\nBut I think you also made one of the worst possible decisions of what to do with them once he realized they had no way home. There are sadly lots of stories out there of cab and rideshare drivers, taking advantage of women that are alone and drunk. \n\nWhat you should have done? Looks like it is time for a slumber party.

I even asked one of them whether they should be drinking that much halfway and they told me that it's fine and they can handle it.\n\nThe reason why I'm there is 1. My girlfriend wants me there cause she said she's going to get dead drunk so she feels safer if im there. 2. The club had a discount for a bigger group.\n\nAlso I've went clubbing with them for similar reasons before. They didn't get dead drunk and they all had someone to pick them up.

This dude literally put the four of them in a cab, gave the cabbie their addresses, and probably paid for it! Cabbies don't usually take drunk fares unless they're pre-paid, I sure AF didn't.

Someone else corrected them. Then a pedantic person corrected the corrector by pointing out that there were other dangers to drunk people, and then you dismissed that comment as being a tangent designed to distract from the original victim-blaming, and then I got concerned that you didn't know the dangers of excessive drinking.
