Am I, 26 F, the A\\*\\*hole when my best friend, Kim, 26 F, came to me with her boyfriend, Joe, 27 M, and told me that since Kim and I were best friends and we support each other, that I should pay her closing on her dream house. Back story: I have been writing a book, I've been working on this book for a couple of years now, and I've been passionate about it. Kim and I have known each other since kindergarten and been best friends ever since. I asked some friends to meet up and help me with to discuss some positive feedback on my book. I was expecting our normal set of 8 friends, but Kim brought a guy with her. This was the first time any of Kim's friends, including me, was meeting Joe. So, Joe took my manuscript, skimmed it, and said that my book was trash. The purpose of the meeting was to get feedback, and I got it rudely from a stranger. I was expecting comments being along the lines of, \"Watch out for using repeating words\" or \"reread the content for any typos and punctuations\", which was some of the comments my other friends gave, hence positive criticism. Putting myself in the spotlight, is scary, you need to have thick skin. I refuse to give anyone any ammunition to use against me later by allowing them to see that they upset me. I am still human, and WORDS will hurt you. I got discouraged and I haven't worked on my book for almost a year after that. I started Dating a guy who became my boyfriend, his name is David 29. I gotten close with his family especially his little sister, Ashley 22. Kim started being hatful towards her. Ashley is really pretty and bubbly and fun to be around. Kim started cancelling our weekly get together. Before you all come for me, I had a discussion with Kim to see how she'd feel if Ashley hung out with us from time to time, but Kim refused, and said our days is our bond. Ashley heard about my book, and knew of someone with an Editing company, and she took my book to have the Editor to look at. Surprisingly, 2 companies wanted my book, but they have different types of audience base. After reading it, one stated I had written so much content in that one book, that you could easily turn it into a series and collect the capital for each book. I went them, they worked with me, and I was able to turn my book into a possible 5 book series and they paid me for the first 2 series. fast forwarding to the closing cost bit. After months of being ignored by Kim, she texts me asking to meet up on our special day. I missed her, so I agreed. I should've known it wasn't the case of missing me too and wanting to rekindle our friendship. I knew then Joe put her up to ask me to pay for their closing cost. He said that now can afford it since I'm an author with 2 books. I refused to kick out any money to her for a book I wrote, and it was her man who trashed it, and you want money from it? Kim's family has been texting awful things to me for not helping her, and I shouldn't let a man break my friendship.

Later I got my book to an editor, and they signed me and published my book and I have received quit a bit of money and she found out and complained to her fianc\u00e9, and he talked her into telling me that I should help her and pay for her closing cost because we are best friends and that's what best friends do and help out in the time of need. Kim always worked hard for what she wanted, and things changed after she got with Joe, and he put her up to asking me for the money. Why should I give her money when she treated me poorly behind this man, but now that she there's something she wants, but can't pay to get it, why isn't she having her boyfriend come up with the money to help her. He bad mouth my book, but he wants the money that said book to pay for the home he's wanting to live in.

I want you to know that I've have reached out to my friend, we finally got to talk one on one, and I found out that my friend is being abused. He kept her in chains, (I saw the bruise around her left ankle) can believe that? she says she would only have free range over the \"Apartment\" only whenever he's home. She says she has to give him her phone to him every day, and he goes through her phone as if she is a child being scolded be her \"Daddy\". She tried to run away from him several times and she said she's called me several times and she used a password that me and my closest friends and I never got the message, otherwise we would've come to help her. That man was trying to break her and make her his submissive. I took her to get medical help and therapy. She's staying with us until we're able to get a RO, so he can't hurt her again. I didn't pay for the house she wanted, but we were able to help her relocate closer to us in a nice one bedroom apt. She's a bit shaking up and she'll stay with us and not in her new apt until she feels safe enough to be alone. David is still being cautious, due to people that go through this type of process, will turn on you and go back to her capture, because of the extreme measure people like that are on your psyche. I will continue to update to let you know the outcome. Be Blessed.", "Agreed! OP, congrats on your success! That is every writers dream. Kim has shared her jealous insecurities with her boyfriend, who probably was already an AH and didn't like you two spending so much time together, but wanted to take you down a few pegs. \n\nThat being said, you do not have a financial obligation to Kim. If she overextended herself financially,  that's on her.", "Lol, thank you. my friend was in an abusive situation, and I didn't pick up on the cues she was trying to send, but she's doing better. Be Blessed.", "Lol, David will love this response, you quoted him verbatim! I know her better than anyone, and now looking back at her reactions to things, I can now remember her facial expression and it looked like she was a shell of a person. He was trying to control her, and it back fired on him. she's not with him anymore, and she's trying to return to her old self again, but it'll take some therapy and we got her signed up with one and she'll start seeing the therapist on Monday. Be Blessed.", "Thank you for your response. My friend was in an abusive situation, and I have helped her get away from him and to safety. He had her chained up whenever they were at home. I only saw the bruises on her left ankle. We took her for medical help and therapy. We are all good now and she's staying with us until she feels safe enough to go to her new apt that we helped her get so she won't have to go back to him. Being broken into submission is no joke. I thought things like that happens in foreign countries, but I now see that things like that happen all over that world. But she's fae now and we did have that one on one, and she confessed everything. We went and got a RO against him to help protect her, and we know that it is going to take a while, but we're going to do whatever we can to help her through this. Be Blessed.", "Lol, that was also one of David's requests, but I told him before my friend and I got our one-on-one, and she confessed everything. I in a way feel guilty that I didn't catch the \"Help me\" cues she was trying to do. My closest friends and I have a safe word we use if we're in need of help, and I didn't catch on, so in that aspect, I feel like i failed as a best friend. But he was always by her side, so I guess my dislike of David clouded my judgement and I didn't' see the \"Help me\" code. Thank God I was able to talk with her and help her get to safety and seek medical treatment to help her recover. I just pray this isn't a ploy of Davids to get her to still abide to his control. Time will time and I hope I'm right and not David, because even though she was a jerk to me, maybe that was her only way to protect herself from further abuse behind closed doors, or she was trying to protect me and not have Her boyfriend cause harm to me, I was always alone whenever I would meet up with her. I will update on the progress. Be Blessed.", "Thank you for the response. My friend was in a very abusive situation and went through some tough stuff with him. She safe now and is staying with us until she feels safe enough to go to her new apt, that we helped her get. We got an RO against him and signed her up for therapy. Be Blessed.", "Thank you for your response. My friend was in a very abusive situation and went through some rough stuff. We got an RO against him and signed her up for therapy. She's slowly but surely returning to her old self, but we're staying cautious, but hopeful. Be Blessed.", "Thank you for your response. I know, a little voice in my head was telling me that I wasn't but after the text messages, and me missing my friend, I wanted to fall into my old role with her and help out anyways like I've always done in the past. But we didn't pay for the house and after hearing and seeing proof of the abuse, we helped her get a RO, and helped her ger a one-bedroom apt, she paid 1st and last months, rent with the last of her money, and we paid her deposit. So, in way she did get some money out of us, but it was a dire emergency, and we were happy to help out in that way for her safety. Meanwhile she's staying with us until she feels safe enough to be alone again. I will do an update on her progress. Be Blessed.", "Thank you for the response. My friend is doing better now that she's away from him. She was being abused and was chained to the bed whenever they were at home. We got a RO and signed her up for therapy, and helped her get a one-bedroom apt. But she's staying with us until she feels safe enough to be by herself again.

Be Blessed.", "That's good to hear. I sometimes wonder how ridiculous a person can get to be honest."]}
