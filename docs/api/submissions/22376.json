Am I, 26 F, the A\\*\\*hole when my best friend, Kim, 26 F, came to me with her boyfriend, Joe, 27 M, and told me that since Kim and I were best friends and we support each other, that I should pay her closing on her dream house. Back story: I have been writing a book, I've been working on this book for a couple of years now, and I've been passionate about it. Kim and I have known each other since kindergarten and been best friends ever since. I asked some friends to meet up and help me with to discuss some positive feedback on my book. I was expecting our normal set of 8 friends, but Kim brought a guy with her. This was the first time any of Kim's friends, including me, was meeting Joe. So, Joe took my manuscript, skimmed it, and said that my book was trash. The purpose of the meeting was to get feedback, and I got it rudely from a stranger. I was expecting comments being along the lines of, \"Watch out for using repeating words\" or \"reread the content for any typos and punctuations\", which was some of the comments my other friends gave, hence positive criticism. Putting myself in the spotlight, is scary, you need to have thick skin. I refuse to give anyone any ammunition to use against me later by allowing them to see that they upset me. I am still human, and WORDS will hurt you. I got discouraged and I haven't worked on my book for almost a year after that. I started Dating a guy who became my boyfriend, his name is David 29. I gotten close with his family especially his little sister, Ashley 22. Kim started being hatful towards her. Ashley is really pretty and bubbly and fun to be around. Kim started cancelling our weekly get together. Before you all come for me, I had a discussion with Kim to see how she'd feel if Ashley hung out with us from time to time, but Kim refused, and said our days is our bond. Ashley heard about my book, and knew of someone with an Editing company, and she took my book to have the Editor to look at. Surprisingly, 2 companies wanted my book, but they have different types of audience base. After reading it, one stated I had written so much content in that one book, that you could easily turn it into a series and collect the capital for each book. I went them, they worked with me, and I was able to turn my book into a possible 5 book series and they paid me for the first 2 series. fast forwarding to the closing cost bit. After months of being ignored by Kim, she texts me asking to meet up on our special day. I missed her, so I agreed. I should've known it wasn't the case of missing me too and wanting to rekindle our friendship. I knew then Joe put her up to ask me to pay for their closing cost. He said that now can afford it since I'm an author with 2 books. I refused to kick out any money to her for a book I wrote, and it was her man who trashed it, and you want money from it? Kim's family has been texting awful things to me for not helping her, and I shouldn't let a man break my friendship.

Later I got my book to an editor, and they signed me and published my book and I have received quit a bit of money and she found out and complained to her fianc\u00e9, and he talked her into telling me that I should help her and pay for her closing cost because we are best friends and that's what best friends do and help out in the time of need. Kim always worked hard for what she wanted, and things changed after she got with Joe, and he put her up to asking me for the money. Why should I give her money when she treated me poorly behind this man, but now that she there's something she wants, but can't pay to get it, why isn't she having her boyfriend come up with the money to help her. He bad mouth my book, but he wants the money that said book to pay for the home he's wanting to live in. I wanted to know if I was being the A**hole for refusing her the money.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

With balls that big I am impressed that either one of them can walk upright.
