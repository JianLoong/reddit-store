My bf dated this other girl (Sara) for 3 years but she passed away shortly after being diagnosed with leukemia. 3 years passed and my bf met me. I knew about Sara before the start of our relationship and I found it charming when he would talk about her. It made me more drawn to him seeing how sensitive he can be.\n\nOur relationship has been perfect; that is until I decided to play Minecraft with him and his little brother in my attempt to bond more with the brother. I was exploring their \"home\" when I stumbled upon a room with a sign over it that read \"sunray sunshine\" (fake). When I asked about the room my bf said that it used to be Sarah's room. Turns out this whole place was built by Sara, my bf, and his brother. I began to feel jealous of Sara. I thought I was making a special memory between me, my bf, and his brother but it turns out I was just a \"visitor\" in their fondest memory of Sara. I suggested we use the room for other purposes but he said no which I thought was odd. \n\nSince then I have become more aware of how much Sara still lingers in his life. I learned that all the trinkets/plush on his house and desk were from Sara. He also still stays in contact with her family and visits them on holidays/birthdays. Whenever his family talks about Sara it's always about how perfect she was and that \"she saved his life\". I feel like I am competing with Sara and that I will never be like Sara nor be as loved as Sara. \n\nI decided to bring this up with my bf. I told him how it's unhealthy to hold on to an ex for this long and he should let go. He got upset and said he has no plans to let go as he has and always will love her. He went on to list all the good things about Sara. He met her when he was at a low point in his life. Sara motivated him to start school and he pursued a good education and now has a well-paying job because of it. He also explained that even though he will always love her, it wouldn't make him feel any less for me because love is not finite. I told him that this does not reassure me that I'm a priority and I would feel better if he were to get rid of gifts from her that way I'm not constantly reminded that I'm not her. He got upset and ended the conversation abruptly \"No and if you don't like my room then don't go in it.\"\n\nNow, I am just constantly reminded of her. She is literally everywhere. It is almost to the point where I fight the urge to roll my eyes whenever she is brought up in the conversation. A part of me feels like I'm in the wrong for asking him to rid of the gifts but at the same time, my feelings are valid too.", "created_utc": 1676575436, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113ypw3/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriend_to_get_rid_of_gifts/", "score": 678, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They never broke up, she died. She will always be a part of his life, and you can be a part of it too, but not in place of her. You need to either accept this or leave.", "YTA I married a lovely man whose first wife died. Cancer is the worst. Her family is my family. She will always be part of our family. I have great relationships with her brothers. Since they are my husband's brothers inlaw, I call them my brothers from another mother.  Their marriage ended in a tragedy, but the love they shared and the life they lived made my sweet husband the man he is today. The life you live and the people you love and are loved by are the most important building blocks of your life. Your relationship, like mine, is built on foundations you did not set but allows you to have a person in your life who knows love and loss.  I know my guy treasures me. His big heart has all kinds of room in it. It seems to me that your heart needs a lot more room in it....", "YTA. You don't decide how or how long someone grieves. \n\nIt's understandable if you can't handle it but the only one turning this into a competition is you.\n\nETA: You know you can't win a competition with a dead person, right?", "YTA \n\nSo here is my question. Do you love this man? If you do, then you need to love this part of his life as well. You are not competing with Sara.  She cannot compete with you. \n\nHowever, are you worried that he is not ready to date anyone yet? Are you worried that he is with you because he doesn't want to be alone? Those are the questions that you need to be asking yourself and talking to him about. Maybe he needs another year to grieve his loss, maybe his doesn't. \n\nI (40f) lost my dad 2 years ago. Since we all lived together, evidence of him is still all over the house. I sold my car and now I drive his little compact car with 170,000 miles on it because it feels comforting to me.  My daughter (10f), still uses a sippy cup from him when she sleeps at night. We all do little, unusual things to remember him. It makes the grieving process much easier.", "YTA, you\u2019ve only been in his life for 6 months and you\u2019re already jealous and competing with a dead woman. Do both of you a favor and walk away, because this relationship isn\u2019t for you. It needs a certain level of maturity, and confidence which sound like you don\u2019t have.", "YTA - Sara is dead. She's not living two convenient towns over, and she's not going to be calling him up one day, while you're at work.  What you're going to do is push him away, by being jealous of someone who literally cannot pose any threat to you.  He loved her. She's gone. He will love and remember her forever. That's just how love and loss works.  Do you want to lose your relationship over something like that?", "You can\u2019t be serious.  She\u2019s not his ex, she *died*.  YTA", "YTA, you can leave the relationship if it is too much but you get 0 say in how he handles sara's passing.", "YTA. Do you realize how terrible of a look it is to be jealous of a dead girl?", "You are a big YTA. Sara, was a warrior. Cancer sucks, coming from a person with cancer. And those memories with her family, or just having a room in their minecraft house for her? They help keep them comforted. There is no competutin with her. It's all in your head. Get over yourself OP. If my partner pulled anything like this, it'd be over.", "Jesus christ, YTA.", "YTA. \nYou feeling are not valid. You are trying to compete with a dead person.", "YTA you're trying to compete with a dead person and losing. Let him cherish the memories of someone he cared for, allow him to heal, and someday that love and decency just might get passed on to you. Granted if you can't get over feeling jealous over a dead girl, I suspect you won't last long.", "YTA - you will destroy your relationship if you insist on competing with a dead person. He loves you, but still loves the woman who he loved but died. Both can be true. PLEASE whatever you do, do NOT take matter into your own hands and trash/destroy thing or try to give ultimatums.\n\nAlso, as other have noted, STOP calling Sara 'his ex' ... that implies a breakup. She DIED ... from cancer. Ugh.", "YTA What is it with people calling SOs who have passed 'ex'? They're NOT exes. This was NOT a breakup he wanted, where the relationship soured and everyone can eventually come to the conclusion that it was best for it to end. There is nothing 'best for it to end' about someone dying!!\n\nI think the best thing to be done is for you to break up with this guy and get some therapy for your insecurities. Or find someone who was raised in a monastery with no contact with other women at all to be with so you don't feel you have to compete with anyone.", "Yes, YTA.\n\nThese are memories of someone who profoundly influenced his life.", "How is there any way that you're not TA here? \n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nThese experiences made your boyfriend into the person you (hopefully) love. Why would you want him to pretend that they didn't happen, and that he had no life before you?\n\nPlease, go to therapy to work through any issues you have with inferiority, and either A. Genuinely apologize to your boyfriend, or B. Break up with him.", "YTA she is not his ex, she died and yes, he will always love her and if you can\u2019t deal with that, move on.", "YTA I feel like the one making this an actual thing, is you. \n\nI dont think you have known him long enough to make these request. \n\nYou seem to be seeking things out that cofirm your bias. \n\nIts okay to express discomfort/have feelings about this. \n\nIts not okay to demand.  You arent doing yourself any favors by taking the perspective \"you were in their favorite memory\" or whatever you said. They can enjoy and make new memories is a place that also has goos old memories.\n\nStop being jealous of a dead girl..", "YTA. If you can\u2019t handle that your partner is always going to love this person, and that she will always be an impact on his life, walk away. If you make him get rid of his memories of her, or make him feel like he can\u2019t share them with you, he\u2019ll just grow to resent you.", "Yta, stop trying to compete with someone who isn't even in the running. SHE IS DEAD. Let your boyfriend keep what memories and trinkets he wants, she will always have a place in his life. If you can't handle that, it's a you problem not a him problem. Get over it and move on or break up with him and stop whining.", "YTA. His ex obviously had a huge impact on his life, and you, his gf of 6 months, wants to erase her.  She's not competing for his attention- she's dead. Stop with the jealous bullshit.", "Y T A he's gonna leave you if you don't stop the constant  competing  with a dead ex  either get over it or  break up with him", "YTA. Yes, you can have your feelings, but to give him grief for his feelings, is not cool.  He'll eventually come to grips with losing Sara.  You need to figure out how to deal with this or move on", "[deleted]", "YTA. While I can understand some frustration about it, it\u2019s definitely not okay to demand anything like that from him. Good news is he\u2018ll be your ex soon anyway.", "So, I understand where your feelings are coming from and they are understandable.  However, you are making yourself the bad \"guy\" in this situation. Stop being threatened by a dead person. Losing her left a hole in your bf's heart that will never fully heal, but that's ok. SHE'S NOT COMPETITION. He would probably care for you more if you showed some respect and support for her and what they created together. Again, there's no reason to feel insecure or jealous, she can't come back and steal him from you.\n\nIn this situation, YTA. You need to move on to someone else if you can't get past this.", "You sure you're 26?", "YTA. She isn't an ex she Died. It is not your place to ask him to get rid of anything of hers. You have only been dating 6 months and honestly that isn't that long in the grand scheme of things. Get over yourself.", "YTA and massively insecure, Dude. He\u2019s not leaving you for a dead person. Also, it\u2019s been 6 months you need to chill out big time.", "SHE IS NOT HIS EX, DAMN! They did not break up, she DIED. And yes, if she had not died, there\u2019s a good chance they would still be together and he would not be with you. If you can\u2019t handle that & are going to continue to be jealous of a literal *dead woman*, then do your boyfriend a favor and end the relationship. YTA.", "YTA. Absolutely stop asking. You are trying to compete with a dead girl. Stop it. She isn't your competition, she's an important part of his history, and there's no risk of her coming back into his life. Move on. If you can't, and you still feel the need to roll your eyes at any mention of her, break up with him now and save everyone from the pain your attitude will cause.", "YTA - your insecurities are clouding your judgement, and now you're obsessing over Sara. If you don't change your thinking, soon it will be impossible for you to be in that house, because, spoiler alert, he won't get rid of the memories of her, the gifts, the objects and he will be really right not to. Take a good thinking at your relationship: do you love him? Do you want to spend your life with him? If yes, acknowledge and accept his past, de happy that he met a wonderful girl, let him cherish the past, and remember you are not competing with her. \nAsking what you did must be really hurtful to him, he must feels like you try to erase his past.", "Are you 26 or 16? Because at your age you should know better. \n\nYTA", "> my feelings are valid too\n\nActually they\u2019re not\n\nYTA", "YTA. His gf died, she's not an ex. You don't get to dictate how other people grieve.", "YTA. I get how it could feel like you couldn\u2019t live up to this image of perfection that they have of her. And I get how it would be important to have a conversation to talk about how you are feeling. However, you\u2019rw wanting to erase this person that they all loved just because you\u2019re in the picture. That\u2019s not how that works. It\u2019s unfair of you to ask that of him", "YTA.  He went through a traumatic experience losing the woman he loved. He deserves to hold onto those items as long as he feels he needs to. That may be forever. \n\nThe items are probably a reminder that had she not passed you wouldn't be with your boyfriend right now but you don't get a say in how he wants to remember her. Especially after 6 months. You don't just forget someone because they died. \n\nMy ex died about 5 years after we broke up. I still mourned her because there was a time I loved her. Her family didnt have a public viewing so I never got to say my goodbye. My gf took me out and we had my ex's favorite shot as a little tribute. She will always have a special place in my heart and honestly idk if I would have stayed with my current gf had she told me to let it go. \n\nRIP Haleigh", "YTA. You have been in a relationship for 6 months, and are feeling jealousy towards someone who has passed on. Might want to take some time to think about what you have asked of him, grief affects folks differently.", "YTA. You aren\u2019t in competition with a dead person. He\u2019s with you now. Either figure out how to be ok with that, or break-up.", "YTA!!!! She will always hold a special place in his heart because she was an amazing women who help him become the men that you know today.. if you can\u2019t deal with that I\u2019m afraid you guys won\u2019t last long. Plus the way you speak of her and your demeanor seem super childish. He seems like such a good person! I\u2019m sad Sara pass away because she seems to have been a great person! If you can\u2019t add to and enrich his life then please leave him.", "Ummm..yta..everything was ok until you saw a 'room' in Minecraft?! That was your line in the sand?", "YTA. You said it great yourself - you\u2019re jealous and insecure. She is not an ex, she is dead. Youre jealous over someone who does not exist and does not pose a threat to you whatsoever.\n\nIf you are worried about him not being able to daye yet, that is valid, but a totally different conversation. \n\nThis is a red flag on your behalf - you havent even been together a year yet and you\u2019re obsessing over someone who is literally dead. You should admire and respect that he once loved someone else in the way he loves you. If he has moved on, and picked you, that should be enough. it is not fair of you to have asked in the first place", "YTA.\n\nThis man lost someone he loved, and from the sound of it was probably going to spend his life with. He didn't have some falling out with her. She died. She died very, very young while still in a loving relationship with him. Even though they weren't married, this is very akin to being a widow or widower. You need to either make peace with the fact that Sara will always be a part of him or move on to someone else. At 26, I can appreciate that you just don't get what that kind of loss is like, but he is never going to \"let go\" or \"get over\" this woman. He will, and it sounds like he really already has, learn to move on in life with that grief, but it will never go away.", "YTA\u2026I mean for God\u2019s sake she died. She\u2019s not an ex.", "YTA. Horrible. I hope he finds someone who is good enough for him soon.", "YTA.\nShe's not an ex, like they broke up. She's an \"ex\" because she DIED.\n\nYou've been with him six months. Not NEARLY long enough to tell him he's done grieving. Not NEARLY long enough to demand he erase three years of memories just because you exist.\n\nThose are HIS memories. If she hadn't passed away, you guys wouldn't even be with him, because he would be with her. All of that time and that love doesn't just vanish, and you have no right to demand it does. Grief take its own time, and some grief is never entirely healed.\n\nIf my husband were to pass away today, I would keep every damn thing he ever gave me. Even if I started dating again, I would keep it all. Anyone who loves me, really, is going to understand about memories AND be secure enough to not be threatened by plush animals and photo albums.\n\nYou are jealous of a ghost. That's insecure and unbecoming. Build your own memories with him. Buy him your own gifts. Don't demand he get rid of the ones he already has. They were there before you, and they'll be there when you're out of his life. Because this level of insecurity would make some people have second thoughts about having you around...", "YTA and all I'm going to say for explanation is I find you to be a downright vile and despicable excuse for a human being", "YTA. Are you 5? Jealous of a dead woman. Who passed young and leukemia is a very painful way to go. And you even said she died shortly after diagnosis. This poor guy barely had time to figure his life out, and then you come busting through the door like kool-aid man and make petty demands.", "Holy shit, he's not emotionally cheating on you. He's not trying to remember the girl who dumped him that he can't get over. \n\nCan you even hear yourself? She passed away. You have got to be one of the biggest assholes I've ever seen in this subreddit. Please leave him, he doesn't deserve your emotional torment. Go work on yourself and get over your absurd insecurities because YOU ARE NOT READY TO DATE. Are you gonna make him throw away his parent's stuff when they go? \n\nYOU DO NOT DESERVE TO BE A PRIORITY OVER A DECEASED EX. From what I can tell you are an insufferable piece of work who gets jealous over a person who isn't even with us anymore.", "YTA I am a widow if someone had the audacity to tell me to get rid of my late husbands things they would find their ass out the door. SHE IS DEAD, she loved hime enough to pick him up when he needed her and help him pursue his dreams and you are benefiting from her efforts in the nice life he is able to have, that he credits to her. He told you that love is not finite, which it isn\u2019t, more can always be made. Your childish and dickish response is, ME ME ME ME ME. But my feelings, but my insecurities, but my petty selfishness. Grow up otherwise I hope he puts you right where you belong, on the curb with the trash.", "YTA, but your feelings are understandable. Clearly you didn't understand in the beginning how important person Sara was to your bf so realizing that can spark jealously. But, here's the thing; one should never compete with the dead, it is of no use and there are no winners. You will never know the answer to the question \"would he have chosen me if Sara was alive?\" and the question itself is moot; we are shaped by our experiences and as you said yourself, \n\n>I found it charming when he would talk about her. It made me more drawn to him seeing how sensitive he can be.\n\nBut also, good news :) Human heart is big enough to love multiple ppl, so his love for Sara does not take away his love for you.", "YTA. Everyone is allowed to have a past. This is cold", "YTA", "YTA. You\u2019re jealous of a ghost, and when you lose him, it won\u2019t be due to her but your own ugly actions.

I hope you reconsider how you handle thing going forward", "YTA if you are so uncomfortable you should probably look into therapy.

That\u2019s bullshit.\n\nWhen and if he\u2019s ready to put away some or all of the memories he\u2019ll do it in his own time, not to appease a girlfriend of less than a year.\n\nYTA. You may not be mature enough to be in this relationship.", "YTA", "YTA. Why do you think you're in competition with a dead woman? This is someone for him changed his life. She literally is no longer here with any of the rest of us. You will never see her again and you're acting like she could walk through the door tomorrow. Just break up if it's that big of a deal.", "\"my feelings are valid too\" are they? you're being insecure and spiteful over a dead person, you're having a competition in your head with a dead person\n\nidk if that's valid\n\nI think he should \"let go\" of the person hes only dated for 6 months who's being extremely weird about him having a past relationship with someone else\n\nYTA anyway, she died, she isn't his ex", "YTA here, for a few reasons. \n____\nYour BF & Sara were very much still together when she died, while technically he\u2019s not considered a widow because they were not married, technicality has no place in hearts, minds, and memories for him and his family. \n\nThe truth most likely is, if she were still alive, she could have very well still been part of their family. \n\nCalling her his \u201cex\u201d is horrific. She died, they didn\u2019t break up, she is not nor will ever be his \u201cex\u201d. And it probably hurts him to his core every time you refer to her as such. \n\nRelationships that end because of a break-up have closure\u2026 relationships that end because of death do not and will not ever. \n____\nSomething happens during the grieving process when someone very loved dies\u2026 anything negative fades away. Someone grieving does not want to have these negative memories, so their brain pushes them away and they recall all the positive memories instead. \n\nThis can *never* be a competition, because it will be impossible for anyone to ever \u201cwin\u201d. \n\nAcceptance of this is what is required, any person who will be in a relationship with your BF (or any other \u201cwidow\u201d) would also have to welcome the memories of Sara into their lives. \n____\nEventually the grief will fade some for your BF & his family. Maybe they will slowly put those memories (and items) away\u2026 but it can *only* be done at their pace. Any exterior pressure to do so faster will not work but actually backfire on you. \n____\nAs far as having a relationship with someone who lost a loved one during a previous relationship\u2026 it is quite different than any other type of relationship. \n\nThis requires a very special (and empathetic and patient) person to be able to gracefully deal with. \n\nYou are not this special person, you are just the AH here. \n\nI hope your BF shortly considers you his ex.", "YTA. As I was reading, I see you clearly admit that you were jealous and it was making you feel insecure. I thought \u201cmaybe, just maybe, this is one of those posts where current partner expressed her feelings validly and honestly and got shot down by still grieving BF\u201d\u2026 then the first thing you told him was \n\n\n>how it\u2019s unhealthy to hold on to an ex for this long and he should let go. \n\n\nSERIOUSLY? You had a chance to have a heartfelt conversation about your feelings and be reassured that while her continued existence in his life as his DECEASED GF, NOT HIS EX was there, his love is not finite. He put it so perfectly. Then you went and shot yourself in the foot by acting like a bull in a china shop trying to erase her.\n\n\nYou\u2019ve been there for 6 months. She was there for 3 years, and will *always* be a part of who he is. Figure out whether or not you can be with a widower, because right now, you\u2019re just acting like a spoiled brat.", "My boyfriend has an ex that committed suicide, he keeps her obituary in his truck console. He also dated a woman who had a young daughter that got murdered while they were dating, and I have comforted him on more than one occasion when he becomes melancholy with memories of a happy little girl that wasn't his. I have never felt that these people that I've never met are a threat to our current relationship. He can love more than just me, and these were people that shaped him into the man I met and fell in love with. They will always be a part of him, and I accepted that when I accepted him.\n\nYTA. You need to do some deep reflection on why you are so threatened and jealous of a dead girl.", "She's not his ex. They were together until death did them part. YTA.", "YTA.  Break up. You're too immature to be in an adult relationship. You don't compete with the dead and she isn't his ex. They didn't breakup. She died. If she was alive you wouldn't be together  but hey..she's DEAD.  You are creating drama from literal ashes.", "YTA- She's not an ex she DIED, if she didn't you wouldn't even be with him. You can't dictate how he grieves or how he feels about her, no one is asking you to compete with her. Your own insecurities are doing this, which is something YOU have to work on. If you can't take him keeping peices of a loved one then you should do him a favor and bounce.", "I feel like some people are being unnecessarily harsh. Your feeling are valid, but your request is not. It sounds like your boyfriend never really got over her death. I think I can understand your feelings. I\u2019m guessing you feel like someone that\u2019s just a stand in for Sara. The solution is for you to either accept how he is or to move on. I suggest the second because it doesn\u2019t seem like this is something that can be negotiated.", "YTA. Not for feeling the way you do - it's fine to not want to be with someone who lost the love of their life to death, because it CAN feel like you are the second choice and you have to compete with the memory. But if you are a person who can't handle that, then you should not go for a guy who has a dead spouse or girlfriend. You said it yourself: You found it attractive on him when you met. Now you see the flipside. You can't just change him now that it's an inconvenience to you.\n\nSo YTA for yelling him to move on and to get rid of the things. You should instead decide if you can live with a man who still grieves his dead partner. If yes, let him take all the time he needs, and know that he might never move fully on. If not, just break up with him. If you can't live with someone who still grieves their dead partner, it's understandable and doesn't make you an asshole - you just have to take the consequences and break up.", "YTA.", "Somebody doesn't know what \"ex\" means...\ud83d\ude44 YTA", "YTA. grow up. she\u2019s dead. he\u2019s allowed to remember her. you\u2019re acting like a child.", "Ohhhhhh YTA.

And jealous of a dead woman, which is sad.", "She will never be his ex, because she died his girlfriend.

My bf dated this other girl (Sara) for 3 years but she passed away shortly after being diagnosed with leukemia. 3 years passed and my bf met me. I knew about Sara before the start of our relationship and I found it charming when he would talk about her. It made me more drawn to him seeing how sensitive he can be.\n\nOur relationship has been perfect; that is until I decided to play Minecraft with him and his little brother in my attempt to bond more with the brother. I was exploring their \"home\" when I stumbled upon a room with a sign over it that read \"sunray sunshine\" (fake). When I asked about the room my bf said that it used to be Sarah's room. Turns out this whole place was built by Sara, my bf, and his brother. I began to feel jealous of Sara. I thought I was making a special memory between me, my bf, and his brother but it turns out I was just a \"visitor\" in their fondest memory of Sara. I suggested we use the room for other purposes but he said no which I thought was odd. \n\nSince then I have become more aware of how much Sara still lingers in his life. I learned that all the trinkets/plush on his house and desk were from Sara. He also still stays in contact with her family and visits them on holidays/birthdays. Whenever his family talks about Sara it's always about how perfect she was and that \"she saved his life\". I feel like I am competing with Sara and that I will never be like Sara nor be as loved as Sara. \n\nI decided to bring this up with my bf. I told him how it's unhealthy to hold on to an ex for this long and he should let go. He got upset and said he has no plans to let go as he has and always will love her. He went on to list all the good things about Sara. He met her when he was at a low point in his life. Sara motivated him to start school and he pursued a good education and now has a well-paying job because of it. He also explained that even though he will always love her, it wouldn't make him feel any less for me because love is not finite. I told him that this does not reassure me that I'm a priority and I would feel better if he were to get rid of gifts from her that way I'm not constantly reminded that I'm not her. He got upset and ended the conversation abruptly \"No and if you don't like my room then don't go in it.\"\n\nNow, I am just constantly reminded of her. She is literally everywhere. It is almost to the point where I fight the urge to roll my eyes whenever she is brought up in the conversation. A part of me feels like I'm in the wrong for asking him to rid of the gifts but at the same time, my feelings are valid too.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
