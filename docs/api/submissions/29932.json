Life has not taught you any valuable lessons yet I assume. You alienated your sister over some dog hair. Dog hair. YTA", "First, your couch is never going to stay clean (assuming you actually want to use it).\n\nSecond, you and your guests will probably leave behind a lot more loose hair than your sister briefly sitting on your sofa. So it's still going to have hair on it.\n\nThird, for a few bucks, you can buy rollers that will pull loose hair right off of clothes and furniture in a few seconds. (This includes all of your hair).\n\nIf you were talking about something that would permanently damage your sofa, like your sister was covered in wet paint, then yeah, THAT would have made sense.\n\nThis was a strange hill to die on.\n\nYTA", "yta, \n\n\"my sister had the nerve, if you can believe it, to sit on the thing that is literally built for sitting. and she had HAIR on her!\"\n\nthe worst type of host", "Do you own towels?  Put one on your precious sofa.  YTA.", "If you are worried about your couch getting dirty, put plastic on it like people did in the 70s-80s. What\u2019s more important to you, the relationship you have with your sister, or an inanimate object that can be easily cleaned?", "Do you not own tape? Or a towel or a sheet? YTA", "YTA. Look, I get it. I like a clean house too, but I like my family and friends even more than that. When you invite someone into your home you are a host and part of that is making your guests feel welcome and being told they cannot sit on your furniture is so incredibly rude. If you care that much about your couch then either get covers for it that can easily be pulled off and washed. Or, like the rest of us do, after your guests leave tidy up. Invest in a lint roller and call it a day. I feel bad for your sister. You owe her a massive apology.", "Yta. Unless you never actually use that couch it will get dirty by everyday use. I have a dog and I am usually covered with dog hair. I advised my mom and my sister who I visit regularly and who don't have a pet inside the house to just have a blanket for me, so I can sit on it. Mom refused and told me she cleans regularly so she can deal with it. My sister has a very white home so she welcomed the idea. You can protect your stuff without being an A-hole.", "If you don't want her coming over, this is the way to do it.\n\nYTA", "YTA. I mean, come on.", "YTA. Use a lint roller or vacuum after she leaves, it\u2019s not going to permanently or even temporarily ruin your couch which apparently means more to you than your relationship with your sister.", "1- No matter how hard you try, that couch will not remain clean\n\n2- If you\u2019re worried about guests making a mess on the couch, buy some nice throws/sheets and put them on the couch before guests arrive. \n\n3- lint rollers, damp cloths and rubber brushes are good for removing animal fur\n\n4- YTA. It was very rude of you to invite your sister round and not allow her to sit on the sofa. I\u2019m shocked you even asked.", "YTA. Put a freaking blanket or cover on the couch if your so anal about it staying clean. What about friends who use public transit? Trust me, they'll bring more crud onto your precious couch than your sister and the dog hair she had ever will!", "Yta. I get it, it's a new couch, but you could out a towel down. It's dog hair, not mud. Couches don't stay clean forever.", "Yta. You torched your relationship with your sister when you could have just used lint rollers. Weird hill to die on.", "YTA. You\u2019re being ridiculous", "It\u2019s a one time visit that you can vacuum up all the small bits of dog hair. It\u2019s not like she brought the dog with her. Dog hair only really sticks if they\u2019re everywhere. Most of the time it just stays stuck on the clothes. \n\nYTA - You threw someone out for something easily solved by a vacuum cleaner.", "YTA\n\nHave y'all never heard of pet hair rollers? Hand one over and ask people to roll their clothes before they sit. Or packing tape does the trick, too.", "YTA. It\u2019s dog hair, not plague. Vacuum it up and chill tf out OP \ud83d\ude44", "YTA. And a huge weirdo.", "Buy a couch cover. Invite your sister over and apologize. YTA.", "You're 29 years old and you wouldn't let your sister sit on your couch?

I guess it's time to not ever invite her back.", "Cover it in clear plastic and get a Jesus statue", "NTA.... as a dog owner, I make sure when I leave my house to go to someone elses house, I am not covered in dog hair. Especially if it's brand new furniture. \n\nYour house is your rules. You worked hard to get what you have. You offered her another seat, and she still disrespected you. She then ran to mommy like a child. I am shocked that they both thought it was acceptable to be covered in dog hair and sit on a brand new couch.", "NTA. You don't want other people tracking things into your house. If your sister can't understand something as simple as 'Don't get my brand new furniture dirty', then you're better of not having her in your home.", "YTA, buy a long roller. Seriously this is beyond ridiculous.", "It's called a lint roller. YTA", "YTA. If you were that concerned about your couch, put down a towel. Also pray that you don't know any free bleeders.", "Tell me this is your first house without telling me this is your first house, lol, You will get over this shortly when you see how hard it is to keep shit immaculate on the daily.", "Yta", "Nta. Your house your couch your rules. If she was Gonna clean it maybe it\u2019d be different. You gave her an option and she didn\u2019t take it", "YTA.  Put down a sheet or towel or ask her to bring (or provide her) a lint roller, or even just a roll of masking tape.", "It\u2019s rare to have a couch solely as a useless piece of art, but whatever floats your boat.\n\nESH. You for obvious reason, sis for whining to mom, and mom for interfering.", "Yta reminds me of that episode of The Conners where the chick gets a couch and refuses to let relatives sit on it and yells at them for doing anything she deems endangering the couch.\n\nIt\u2019s a couch. It will never stay pristine. If you want pristine wrap it in plastic like grandmas do.", "I hope it\u2019s white and you spill red wine on it \ud83d\ude1c", "YTA\n\nbuy some lint rollers", "YTA\n\nThat's some petty b.s.  You know, they make cleaning products for upholstery, right?", "In my house it's the opposite \ud83d\ude05 just step inside and you'll have cat hair all over you.\n\nYTA. Petty", "YTA.  You're being ridiculous over dog hair.  If you were so worried about it, put a towel down.  Wait until someone spills wine/coffee/Kool aid etc on it... Hell my kid painted mine with blue paint once... Dog hair is the least of your worries and easy to clean.", "YTA, yeah. People shed CONSTANTLY. Skin, hair... dust is primarily human skin. Your mattress gets heavier over time because of skin and mites feeding on said skin. Nothing, and I do literally mean NOTHING, is ever as clean as you think it is.\n\nDog hair isn't substantially different from human hair unless you're allergic. You can either be normal, or you can be one of the people with a thick vinyl? cover on their furniture that no one ever wants to visit.", "Aw. It's never fun when a shiny new thing gets spoiled but it's gonna happen.  Sorry, but YTA", "yes, you are.", "Do you have OCD, by any chance?", "I guess you know she have a dog, if so yes you are AITA, coz you never warned her that you dislike Dog hair. 2ND .. YOU invite her over, not your sister to herself, that means you have to apply the unwritten hospitality rules, or are you also an arse if a blind man comes to visit with assistance dog?.. if so please stay alone, and don't pro-create. You would do the world a favor!!!", "YTA, its stupid to expect guests to sit on a barstool. Invest in some cheap fleece throws\u2026walmart has them for under $5 and throw them on the couch so she could sit. I don't like sitting on leather and my sis has a leather interior in her car, i always toss a sheet or throw over her seat before i get in.", "YTA - learn to clean.  People shed hair and skin constantly, you're a person.  You can't expect every person xomomg into your home to be as fastidious as you (apparently) think you are.  Dog/cat/etc.. hair is going to get on your precious couch.  Grow up and get a vacuum if it bothers you that much.", "YTA. As someone who actually sells furniture, I can say you're a certified jerk. Unless you plan to cover it in plastic wrap, the material is gonna get messed up. That's just the natural course of things. Just like it'll be the natural course of things that your family is gonna treat you like the jerk you are for this. Have fun with the couch, as you'll sitting on it alone for a long time to come.", "YTA and now you\u2019ve jinxed your own couch!", "Yta, you were being a bad host. It\u2019s dog hair, it\u2019s gunna happen. If you want to keep your house so clean you shouldn\u2019t invite people to your house.", "YTA that also clearly doesn't like dogs or pet hair, which is easily removed with a hoover. do you always look all over your guests to check them for non human hair or were you just feeling particularly sassy this day.", "NTA.  Your house and your rules.  Also none of your mothers business.", "NTA. I don't blame you for not wanting dog hair on a brand new couch. You could have offered a towel for her to sit on. Just a suggestion. Congratulations on your new place!", "ESH. \n\nExpecting anyone with pets to never sit on your furniture is a ridiculous ask. \n\nThat being said, even if you\u2019re an asshole for insisting on it it is still your house.
