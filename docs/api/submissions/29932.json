GTFO of my house.", "NTA, Your couch is new and you want to keep it that way as long as possible. You offered your sister a place to sit and she turned it down. She is the AH.", "Your title is wrong lol", "Wouldn\u2019t want to spend money on an item then use it for its intended purpose. \n\nYTA", "Since when is 29 young?", "It was over a sofa", "I think she needs one of those clear plastic couch covers Grandma used to use in the 50s.", "Does.... Does OP not own a towel or blanket that could have been put down?", "To add to the third point, sticky tape wrapped around your hand sticky side out if you can't be assed getting the rollers. Couches are meant to be sat on. OP if you're that concerned about dirt, cover it in plastic.  YTA", "Also it\u2019s not that hard to put a towel down if the dirt level was extreme. This is also good for toddlers or children who are prone to spills and accidents. You can simply wash the towel after.", "Yeah I mean this reminds me of every time I\u2019ve gotten a new rug. I always ask guests to take their hies off or at least not walk on the rug. Never rude about it but you easily walk around the rug if you\u2019re not comfortable taking your shoes off. Rug always ends up dirty and I feel like shit that one time my dad made ME feel like shit for asking him to comply.", "Are u fucking crazy?! Do you want hair on the towels?!", "they are probably \"no-use-em\" towels too", "Lol  nice.", "or get a bedsheet or a towel instead of insulting her. just offer to cover the couch so she can sit down and stop being TA", "That's my thought. I know most people are saying he's TA, but at the end of the day, he set a very clear boundary and offered a reasonable alternative, and his sister just completely ignored him. Is it a silly request/boundary? Sure. Is it OP's house where he can make such a request? Yes! If he'd asked her to take her shoes off and she refused, I wonder if everyone would be saying the safe thing. I say NTA.", "Since the person who said it was over 30. \ud83d\ude09", "My dog decided to give birth on my white couch\n\nIt was cleaned.", "I loaned my apartment to a buddy and his girl in Highschool. Had a suede leather couch. Came home to a butt print with hand prints on each side. I would have preferred dog hair.", "My cat's butt decided to open the gates of hell all over my sofa. Two days after I got it. \n\nThere was tears, not sure from the smell, frustration, or combination of both, but it got cleaned and wouldn't even know my cat's ass exploded.", "INFO: How old is nephew?", "Well you can be assured that no one will wish to sit on the priceless furniture that way.", "In fairness I have those kind of decorative towels. But I have usable one as well.", "I'm sorry but did you just refer to your cat as your son\ud83d\ude02", "OP is a man", "Mine did the projectile vomit act. That shit stains but I moved fast so no problem.", "My aunt had a bumper sticker that said Save the Naugas", "I've had many dogs and cats,kids make more mess.", "So?", "Ffs,it's easy to clean a lounge. It is not easy to mend relationships over some dog hair. Its hair,not dog shit! She must be a joy to live with. Don't sit there,don't do that it'll get dirty. Jfc. Be like most sane people and clean up when visitors leave. You'd swear her sister had fur instead of skin."]}
