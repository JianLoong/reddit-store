{"id": 20798, "submission_id": "14kxqck", "title": "AITA for not sharing my inheritance with my sister?", "selftext": "Throwaway acc. because I'm not sure if my family knows my Reddit account, all the names have been changed and all that good stuff.\n\nI, 24(m) have 2 sisters, I'll call them Lisa (28), Kenzie (19). My parents divorced when I was little, leaving the custody battle up to the courts. Our parents agreed to send Lisa and I to live with our godparents Mark (he met my father in law school, and they were very close) and Vivian. After a while, the court decided that my parents would split custody between us, with us alternating who we stay with every other week. \n\nAfter about a year or so, Mark and Vivian moved to the UK, buying quite a large house and estate. A few years later, my mom remarried and had Kenzie. We weren't that close because of the age gap and the time away from her, but the relationship stayed mainly positive.\n\nFast forward to when I was sophomore year in high school, I stayed with Mark and Vivian during the summer again because I had always found the UK interesting. Mark showed me how to drive (he was a big car guy), fish and do a bunch of other stuff. (he was like a second father to me, unlike my stepdad). Later on, I attended Uni in Europe, and Vivian and Mark made an effort to come out to visit me, bring me out to dinner, and stuff like that. My real parents called occasionally but never flew out or anything like that. I ended up spending the holidays at their house and it basically became my second home. \n\nI graduated last year, but this was also the year I found out that Mark had cancer, despite this, he still came to my graduation. I then got a job in the US and moved back. He died earlier this year, and I was sad not to be there for him, but Lisa and I flew out to go to the funeral. Afterwards, the family lawyer contacted us and informed each of us of our inheritance. Much to my surprise, we both received a large sum of money in the 7 figures, in the form of a trust. I also received Mark's car collection, worth about half a million dollars, which included the 911 he taught me to drive in. Vivian got the rest, and sold their house and to get a smaller apartment in London. \n\nWhen Kenzie found out what we received, she got jealous and demanded we share the money with her because we are family. (I don't even have access to most of it until I turn 30) My mother also keeps calling me asking that Kenzie gets some of it to pay for her college and stuff. (mom got more than enough for Kenzie's college through the divorce settlement) I told them that it was my money, and Kenzie had nothing to do with Mark or Vivian, and that's why she didn't get anything. I was really mad that they asked for this without even coming to the funeral. I've since then stopped talking to them because they always find a way to bring it up during a conversation.\n\nAnyways, Am I the Asshole here?\n\ntldr; I got money from godfather dying, my half-sister wants some, I said no.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1687920984, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14kxqck/aita_for_not_sharing_my_inheritance_with_my_sister/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kenzie doesn\u2019t know them and has no relationship with them so she isn\u2019t entitled to asking anything that Mark has worked for.\n\nPeople always try to ask for money once they know someone got a nice sum.

You may have to go LC/NC to avoid harassment from your family members", "NTA, and I\u2019m saying that as someone who did have the money stolen from me when my mom died (my dad lied to me about my portion of the life insurance payout even existing and drank it away before I knew what had happened; I was facing a medical bankruptcy at the time because I\u2019m chronically ill and couldn\u2019t afford the bills).\n\nThese weren\u2019t Kenzie\u2019s godparents, and they didn\u2019t seem very close to her. They left the money to you, not Kenzie. It would be different if they left her some and you took it, or if they were her bio parents and cut her out for no reason or something. But this doesn\u2019t really seem like it has anything to do with her.

My condolences on your loss.", "NTA.  You and your sister, Lisa, had developed a longstanding relationship with Mark and Vivian.  The trust is your inheritance, not Kenzie's.  It can be a difficult lesson to learn, but life is not fair, and it's unreasonable to expect that everything should be fair.  You are not expecting to inherit anything from Kenzie's father and his family.  Kenzie has the benefit of not being sent away from her parents at a young age.\n\n I'm so very sorry for your loss.  Mark and Vivian sound like they are lovely.", "First of all, I\u2019m really sorry for your loss. mark may not have been your blood father, but he was a father nonetheless. \n\nWhat\u2019s all these posts of people who are not entitled to inheritance or trust, demanding that they are? \n\nNTA. \n\nKenzie had nothing to do with Mark or Vivian. I hope you and Lisa firmly say no to her and your mom.", "NTA. So, how exactly does she think she deserves it? She wasn't raised by Mark, nor did she interact with him. He wasn't going to give money to a complete stranger. Which she was.\n\nBlock your mom & Kenzie. They obviously aren't going to STFU about this. Going no contact is the best thing you can do.", "NTA\n\nWhen you come into some big money (lottery, inheritance, new job, etc.), there's always an influx of people feeling entitled to that money. Doesn't mean they are.\n\nHere, Mark made a clear will, while being sounds of mind. If Kenzie received nothing, it's because Mark didn't want to give her anything. So, she has absolutely no claim to that money.", "NTA. This is your inheritance.  Period.", "If you respect Mark enough to honor his last wishes then there is no question - he left that money to you because he wanted you to have it.  It isn't your decision, it was his, and through his will he has spoken.\nNTA.", "Nta. Ywbta if you gave a dime to your mom or Kenzie. If snark wanted them to gave it, it would\u2019ve been in his will. Hence the trust/age 30. You aren\u2019t responsible for paying to support a child that isn\u2019t yours. I\u2019m guessing your parents never paid child support to Mark as well, so they already greatly benefited financially. Entitled people get nothing. Otherwise you can choose how to invest in your future and create the life and relationships you deserve. And make sure you put the money in a trust yourself when the current trust ends and be wise on who your beneficiaries/executors are.", "First off, I'm so sorry for your loss.\n\nDefinitely NTA.\n\nI think it's probably a very good idea to be clear with your boundaries immediately. If you say no, hold firm. (This, of course doesn't mean that you can never gift them things/money or help in an emergency, but it does make it clear that it is YOUR money, and YOUR choice which I think is important.) \n\nI also am sorry that they have put you in this position, that really stinks because it must be a hard time for you with the loss of Mark. I surely hope they have at least also offered a supportive environment, but given what you have said, I'm guessing maybe not.\n\nBest of luck navigating this, and I hope you and your other sister have some support somewhere in this. If this gets tricky or you need help navigating the conversation, perhaps you other sister and you acting setting the same boundaries might be a good idea.", "NTA. They only showed interest when there was money involved. Keep the inheritance, enjoy the memories with the car. \n\nI would even suggest to stay no contact, but that is up to you.", "op=NTA\n\nSo your mother got a huge enough settlement in the divorce from YOUR father to pay for your half siblings college fees(even tho this child is not YOUR father's child)?  And she expects you to give this half sibling money from a man who she has no connection to(your father's law school friend).\n\nInsane level of Audacity on your mother and sister's part.  First off Mark never had to leave anything to any one of you but he chose to leave money to you and Lisa because you literally lived with him as children and therefore had a relationship with him that Kenzie simply did not have.\n\nFeel free to keep them on low/no contact until they figure out how to remove their heads from their arses.", "NTA. You got an inheritance from YOUR godfather, and she has no claim to it. That's your money, your inheritance, you can do as you please with it. If she thinks that's unfair, sooner or later, she needs to realise life is unfair. Besides, from what I understand, you don't have access to the money until you're 30 anyway.", "NTA it's your inheritance, gifted to you by someone that clearly loved you and treated you like a son.  Your half sister has no entitlement to the money, an seemingly no connection to Mark so why would she get anything?  Also very stupid of her to demand this crap as a point worth making to her: you'd presumably have been as generous as Mark evidently was, following the example he set for you.  But if she's going to demand cash from you then she can say goodbye.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Kenzie did meet Mark and Vivian awhile back, when they came to visit for Thanksgiving and the interraction was mostly positive. We used to be on pretty good terms, before the death. Lisa had a similar relationship to Kenzie with Mark and Vivian, albeit being their goddaughter, and I was the only one who really kept in contact with them. I'm noy fully sure of her intentions behind asking for money, but I would venture to guess she thinks its unfair Lisa got a bunch of money while she  did not, even though they has a similar relationship. Kenzie goes along with most of what mom says, so i hope there is no malicious intent there. Mom on the other hand has more than enough money to pay for Kenzie's college, so I would be more inclined to think that's malicious.", "Your godfather is the one who decided what to leave to each of you. It doesn't matter that Lisa didn't have a much closer relationship to him than Kenzie. He wanted you and Lisa to be financially secure because of his friendship with your father. Kenzie has a different father, so there is no connection there. I can't fathom why your mother would think she's entitled to anything.
