I have a parrot and I\u2019d be really happy if someone cared for mine and kept them engaged as you did.", "Heck, we had a parrot and my husband taught him phrases like \"Where're my pants?\"  It was hysterical.  You really gotta watch your language around a motivated parrot.", "This is like my dog barking louder when I don't give her what I know she wants as soon as she wants it.

He needs stimulation and activities that meet his intelligence level. You did well.", "You taught him five words, that's hardly anything. And why is a parrot screaming about wanting one thing different than them screaming they want food or treats? Parrots are loud. Plus, African Greys live for 45 years, he'll probably learn a lot more words over time anyways. NTA, you kept him stimulated like they asked and didn't intentionally teach the parrot anything annoying or bad.", "NTA. Your Dad said, keep him stimulated. He didn't specify how.

Lol\n\nHonestly it's hilarious your dad is mad... what did he expect after vauge instructions.", "I can't make a judgement on this because it's too adorable. I just imagine your poor dad running after Pete all day long, repeatedly bringing him his ladder, perch, and bagel cascade, and eventually calling you in frustration because he's tired of being Pete's errand boy.

He's a parrot, dude, demanding is part of their DNA.\n\nGood job on keeping Pete happy and occupied.  NTA\n\nI babysat a parrot, Jack, for a week or so.  It was an adventure.   Best way to keep him occupied was to put some water in the tub, and let him play in it.", "NTA. He needed intellectual stimulation. Your father wasn't specific and you taught the bird news words that are useful. Lots of parrots scream when they want something. At least now they know specifically what it is he wants.\n\nYour Dad should be happy you didn't teach the bird swear words or the Spongebob Theme song or something annoying. I babysit my parent's cockatiel (Waaay less work than a parrot.) and often put on Disney songs for him.

You were told to keep the parrot stimulated.

Might bug your parents but I would think it\u2019s cool for my pet to communicate what he wants", "NTA - you kept the bird entertained like your parents asked. You also asked for specific activities that would be nice for the bird. I don't mean to be hard on your parents, but they really should've thought about it more.", "NTA, but what is a bagel cascade?", "NTA. He got off lightly.

That is a smart parrot.", "One time my friend and I left his very sassy lhasa apso (Lu) with my parents and their very timid king charles cavalier (Princess).

You couldn't expect Dad to say \"do not teach him to scream, OK?\" and as others have said, he had the chance to think up new activities and ask you to teach them, and he didn't; you didn't do stupid stuff, took a very reasoned approach to what to do with Pete; so now he must live with it...", "My brothers parrot can sound exactly like the phone ringing.\n\nHe used to also shout on the dog who would come running in and the parrot would fling nuts at him (the dog likes nuts). \n\nHe also screams at you if you\u2019re eating and don\u2019t share with him.\n\nParrots are a handful.

The amount of annoyance varies: we have houseplants at the low end, cats at the medium end, dogs and children at the high end, and only those who need to be occupied to distraction at all times at the very highest level get parrots.

The Grey's favorite activity while staying there was to call all 3 dogs into the room by name, give them commands like sit, play dead, roll over, etc. and then when they did all of it, she would scream, \"Bad dogs! Bad dogs!\" \n\nPoor puppers, but gotta admit, it was pretty hilarious to watch. \n\nHer cockatoo would toss food to her dog, too.

Do you want some candy?\"", "My Moluccan cockatoo learned to call \"Kitty, kitty, kitty!\" And the cat would come and then be confused then my cockatoo would laugh!", "I know I'm tired, because I read cascade as casserole, and was wondering what was in a bagel casserole \ud83e\udd23", "Hahahaha NTA \n\nYou gave that parrot wonderful stimulation and learning opportunities \n\nYour dad is likely ignoring his requests so he screams. That\u2019s on your dad- he chose to get an African Grey. Congrats, he has a feathery 2 year old.", "NTA- honestly I would've done the same thing. They said to give him activities and wouldn't give you an example, so you looked up activities for birds and picked one. They should've been way more specific.", "NTA At least the parrot only learned the words for his belongings. He wasn't taught swear words. You didn't sit there watching raunchy porn around him (ergo hes not making female moaning noises.) Your dad said to keep him stimulated. You did. Not his fault he didn't actually outline what they do to stimulate Pete.\n\nI lived in a foster home that had a parrot. I disremember what kind he was but his name was Paco. He was a riot.

His favorite phrases were \"F\\*ck off\" and \"shut the f\\*ck up\" lol.", "This is so weird. I have 2 parrots and a cockatiel that do nothing but squawk at me when I go in their room to feed them.

Maybe \"mom and dad don't talk enough\".", "African greys in particular have incredible vocab learning skills, and the ability to use the words they learn in context. \n\nSomeone I know has a grey that learned the phrase \"bad boy\"....and now whenever he does something he knows they won't like he just looks right at them and yells \"bad boy!\" They're born to troll.", "Birds (and fish) are so pretty, but messy and require so much space and work and that's why I will never have a bird and leave it to the people that have the time, space, and energy for them.

We also taught it Jingle Bells.", "My husband had a parrot who could do the phone ringing also. If he picked up his phone, the parrot would make a beep of the key being pressed, and then say \"Hello?\" in my husband's voice.", "Ferrets sit somewhere between dogs and children. They're awfully mischievous, crafty, and needy, but at least you can put them in a cage when you need a break.", "Years ago I was visiting an acquaintance that had a pet ferret.

Cute but smelly and oversexed.", "Me too.  : )", "This is the most disappointing answer but after googling it at least all the parrots playing with them look happy.", "Had this with my husband's Grey. He called my cats, in my voice, and when they came he flew at them like a bomber pilot. Stole their food, too. He could parrot 4 different people and held conversations, so when I woke up I thought our roommates were still at home. He was a handful.", "I once heard parrots   being described as being like a hyperactive toddler nonstop", "Our friends had a cockatiel and we had a chihuahua. The chi was a pup and a tool thief. The cockatiel was also a tool thief. We discovered this when helping fix their furnace and the chi stole the screwdriver and the bird stole the screws. Me and that guys girlfriend weren't helpful at all, we just kept laughing at the guys when they couldn't find the tools and screws.", "Sounds pretty undersexed if he tried to fuck your purse \ud83d\ude02", "Yeah, when our neurodivergent friends are around it's just constant quoting and we love it... But we're all mostly capable of not shouting this at 2am when other people are asleep. A parrot, not so much!", "OMG! \n\nMy sister's cockatoo hated people being in the kitchen, but he'd just bang his cage and squawk, so at least we knew it was him?

A lot of the time.", "They're so damn smart! \n\nMy sister's also held whole conversations with herself but my favorite was when the phone rang she would do a perfect half-conversation in my sister's voice like:\n\n\"Hello? Oh, HIIIIIII! How are you? Mmmm-hmmmmm. Mmmmmmm-hmmmmmm. Okay, love you, bye bye!\" \n\nIt was so freaking adorable. I always thought sis should record it for her outgoing message.", "Many parrots are like toddlers. Greys are more like 4 or 5 year old kids! They can learn the actual meanings of words in pretty decent quantity, not just how to say them, and have some basic conversations that resemble the sort you have with a toddler, but they have even more intelligence when it comes to things like problem-solving. Hence why OP could teach 5 new labels/terms in such a short time, which is awesome for both of them. :D\n\nIf you can keep them entertained and stimulated without spoiling them too much, they are much much chiller. Much like, well, toddlers and pre-schoolers! Gotta tire out not just their bodies, but their clever little brains, you know? In the good way, of course, by learning and playing.", "I have a a bearded dragon, and at one point had 5 of them. Very low on the annoyance scale. It's really only the sound of the crickets to feed them that might raise that a little haha", "I assumed that the ferret had had sex with everything in this guy\u2019s apartment since he said sorry but didn\u2019t act surprised. My ex kept that friend after the divorce."]}
