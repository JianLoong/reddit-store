We see countless stories here of such situations. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t absolve her, but it could explain it. Do you want to keep a relationship with your aunt going forward? If so, talk to her privately and explain how much this hurt your feelings and see if she will open up about the real reason. If it\u2019s as simple as it seems on the surface per your post - cut your losses.", "NTA, I don't know what your aunt is thinking. Like you said, you've been bald half your life. If anyone asks about the pictures all she has to say is that that's your normal hair. And her comment on how you would look in a fancy dress with no hair was out of line.", "NTA. Your aunt was completely out of line to demand that you wear a wig to her wedding just because she doesn't want people to ask questions about your appearance. It's your choice to be bald and it's a part of who you are. You have every right to be comfortable with your appearance and not to be pressured into conforming to someone else's idea of what is socially acceptable.  \nMoreover, your aunt's demand was insensitive and disrespectful, especially since she was previously supportive of your choice. Your decision not to attend the wedding is a consequence of her actions, and you have every right to communicate your reasons to your family members. It's not immature to be honest with others, especially when they're making unfair demands of you. Your parents should be supporting you rather than criticizing you.", "NTA. it\u2019s not like you decided to go bald out of the blue (even if you did you\u2019d still be NTA).", "NTA\n\nYou told the truth. If the truth makes them want to tear your aunt a new one, that\u2019s on her, not you.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a private issue - people were going to notice your absence.", "NTA - it was hurtful for her to say those things. She can't take them back and you can't help how it makes you feel. Even if she does take them back, you still know how she feels now and that can't change overnight. You might sit down and talk things out with her, if you feel like it, but if you don't and you don't want to go to her wedding, even as a guest at this point, that's understandable", "NTA. Now you know what your aunty really thinks of you. She\u2019s been faking her support all these years. I don\u2019t think what you did was immature. You told your family the truth. That\u2019s all there is to it. Don\u2019t go for the wedding. Like you said, the damage is done.", ">My parents say I was immature to make our private issue public like that if I wasn't going to go anyway\n\nWell at least now you know your parents think maturity means lying by omission and protecting people who judge you. Good information to have. NTA", "NTA. Your aunt cares too much about what others think of her and is ashamed of your appearance. You just exposed her for the AH she truly is.", "NTA and it's your choice if you decide to attend (not as a bridesmaid) now that your aunt is being somewhat more reasonable. Did she apologize though?\n\nYou aren't the one who made this public; if you hadn't attended the wedding, she would absolutely have lied and scapegoated you.\n\nI have no idea why brides (and others related to weddings) seem to think they get to control other people's fundamental human existence. Wearing a bridesmaid dress/tux/suit/colors chosen for a wedding? Within dress code standards. Telling people to color/dye/shave/cover their heads/hair/tattoos/scars? Totally out of fucking line.", "NTA. There's certain things that should be kept a private issue. Someone being superficial about having conditions for their niece to be their bridesmaid is not one of them. If she wasn't okay with the way people reacted, she shouldn't have said it at all. It doesn't even sound like she apologized. There genuinely shouldn't be conditions about being a bridesmaid. A bride should be choosing people who she wants standing by her based off of love and support of those people as they are.\n\nThat being said, I would take time to think about not going at all, especially since you said you two were close. I think it could be a knee jerk reaction.", "NTA - I don't know if she apologised or just grudgingly told you, \"it's fine, whatever, come without a wig\" - AFTER she got so much backlash from the family. Please don't feel guilty for defending yourself in the chat group - what would she have told them if you \"suddenly went missing\" on the day of her wedding? I'm sure she had a scapegoat story prepared... and only YOU get to decide whether you are still hurting from her mean and rude comments, noone else.", "NTA for not wanting to wear a wig as a bridesmaid\n\nBut boycott the wedding completely?", ">I don't need everyone asking why my niece is dying at my wedding\n\nI think this part is worth exploring. Do people often ask you (or your friends or family) if you're ill? \n\nIf so, I can understand where your aunt is coming from. It's her day, and she wants the attention to be on her, not on her \"dying\" niece. \n\nThat said, you're N T A for not wanting to wear a wig, but YTA for a) attention seeking by announcing it to your family and b) not going at all. Your parents are right - you're immature.", "NTA- Although I would wonder why she's done a massive U-turn in supporting you.\n\nYour parents are also AHs for calling you immature when in fact, you've handled this very maturely. I'd show them this thread if I were you. They need to see that their daughter is a reasonable and self-assured adult.\n\nEdit: To add: For all those saying to go to the wedding anyway, I personally would feel very uncomfortable going to a wedding after being insulted like that, and she is only allowing you to go as a bridesmaid now that her family tore into her, so you're actually not welcome to the bridal party anyway. Might as well spend the day doing something worth your time.", "Personally I think you\u2019re going a bit nuclear. Even after she said \u201cno wig needed\u201d, you still aren\u2019t budging. Don\u2019t hold a grudge to prove a point and miss an important day for someone you once treasured. It seems trivial to cut ties, which you will do by not attending. \n\nMild YTA.", "NTA. Being comfortable in your own skin is an absolute right (unless of course that comfort breaks the law, and baldness doesn't do that).", "NTA - People would be tearing you a new one if you just didn't turn up. While the conversation may have been private that is only because her request is shameful. You are not immature at all. So long as there were no embellishments and a simple. I am not going bc aunt is asking me to wear a wig and said I'd look stupid in fancy dress and bald then nothing immature about it.   \n\n\nWhy should you change your look for someone else and the fact she said you'd look stupid is mean. She was trying to bully / manipulate you into not wanting to look 'stupid' at her wedding. You wouldn't look stupid you'll look like you and there's nothing stupid or wrong with that.   \n\n\nYour aunt had made her bed, time to lay in it.", "ESH.\n\nYes, she's a prick for asking, but she's rescinded the ask, so your a prick for not going.\n\nPart of being an adult is working on conflicts and achieving mutually satisfying results. Seems like you've achieved that but are continuing the conflict for no good reason.", "NTA.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine asking someone to change their appearance for the aesthetics of my wedding.", "NTA, but if you insist on boycotting your aunt entirely, setting the family against her for a brief moment of bridezilla fever, you will definitely tip into a\\*\\*hole territory.", "NTA - your family is trying to gaslight. Like it\u2019s clear the aunt has some issues with your baldness (brave I may add) and it\u2019s your fault. She was honest enough to say something she should be able to defend it.", "Massive NTA - It sounds like she is ashamed by how you look. Sorry you going through this as it a good reason you shaved your hair. Also she is a Massive AH and Bridezilla", "The asshole is the \"fun\" aunt.  Stand your ground dear heart, if they don't want you how you are, TOO BAD.  This is all they are getting.  BRAVO for telling auntie NOPE, you either take me as is, or NOPE!", "From the way you're paraphrasing her the aunt comes off as incredibly rude, but I kind of doubt she said it quite like that if you really always had a good relationship with her. Anyway, its one thing to not want to wear a wig, but it seems kind of extreme to go full scorched Earth with someone you were supposedly close to. You could have just said you were uncomfortable and would rather attend as a guest. Your teenager is really showing tbh \ud83d\ude06. YTA.", "NAH, I'll probably get a lot of hate for this but whatever...\n\nYou are obviously not an ass from refusing to go if you don't want to meet her demands, at the same time I don't think her demands are that unreasonable.\n\nLeave the Reddit sphere of empowerment for a moment and look at it from an outside perspective. Going bald IS going to draw a lot of attention to you, period. She is not going to want that on her wedding, it's fair enough that she is the attention focus.\n\nWearing a wig for a few hours isn't a mad ask, it's not like asking someone to cut their hair or dye it as it has a zero recovery time - at the end of the wedding pull the wig off and you are as you were before, there are no lasting changes.\n\nThe wig is basically an article of clothing... If a wedding party asked that everyone wears blue it won't be controversial, so why is asking everyone to \"wear\" hair?", "Leaning towards YTA because at the end you were not going even though your aunt gave in to you with the no wig. That's being extremely petty to family.", "YTA - you twisted the truth. According to your post she said to be in her bridal party she wanted you to wear a wig. She didn\u2019t say as a guest to attend you would have to wear a wig. \n\nMany brides ask bridesmaids to colour/cut/ style hair different ways. You could have simply declined and gone to support her as a guest - but you had to be dramatic and make her out to be a monster at a joyous time in her life.\n\nAll those times she supported you, loved you and encouraged you when she may not have agreed with your choices and you spat on her in return. \n\nI hope she has a beautiful day and I hope you grow a little", "Lol NTA. This is amazing.", "ESH, I understand that you\u2019re hurt but Bridezillas are terrifying and it wouldn\u2019t do you any good to stay resentful towards your aunt, especially if you have a good relationship besides that comment. I\u2019m sure once that whole event is over and she can finally decompress, you can have a serious conversation about it. I would like to believe, given that she loves you (and asked you to be her bridesmaid), that she will reflect and apologise. \n\nIf I were you I would attend that event as a bridesmaid, have fun and talk sense later.\n\nEdit: meant to write esh not nta", "NTA. What you do with your hair is your business. A bride has no right to demand their bridesmaids cut or grow their hair and similarly if you want to have no hair that's fine. If people ask about it, that's understandable. But at a wedding most will already know and it's really easy when you start speeches if people are asking or it seems like it's an issue someone can make always just explain.", "NTA\n\nAbout saying what you said in a public platform, but don't burn a bridge with your aunt if you otherwise have no problems with each other. That's selfish and immature. People constantly revise their stances in life, and if your aunt was able to change her mind about you, it would be petty to hold on to your hurt. Just take the apology and move on.", "NTA for not going to the wedding or being angry about it but definitely YTA for putting her on blast in front of the whole family and not keeping it between yourselves. It's not such a bid deal to get everyone arguing and now you've added needless drama and made a whole scene about it. It's her special day and now you've forced yourself into it and made yourself the main character. \n\nWhen someone is acting like an idiot, forgive them for their idiocy and don't amplify things by extending the conflict. Life is not reality TV, sometimes you just gotta drop it.", "NTA. As someone who lost her hair from cancer I would not force anyone to wear a wig ever. They can be hot and uncomfortable at the best of times. Your hair (or lack there of) is your choice and the fact that she now wants you to cover you head make it seem like she was disingenuous with supporting you before.", "NTA. You should tell your aunt to buy you a very expensive wig and then donate it to the cancer society. Then still skip the wedding. I (42M) started growing my hair out when my dad was diagnosed with cancer, in case he wanted a wig made. People are super creepy about me having longish hair, even people I don't know. I'm constantly being told to cut it, even though it's not affecting anyone but me. I know where you're coming from, screw everyone else. Do what makes you happy.", "NTA.
