I guess it's just some (at least to me) harmless quirk I have. \n\nSo whenever I am at a store where they want your name I say it's Tom, that's literally the name I use, nothing inappropriate or outlandish just plain Tom. I know I am meant when they call it as I always use the same one so there is no confusion or anything, they yell Tom I get my drink/food and it's never been a problem till now. \n\nA couple days ago I was at Starbucks with my new gf and ordered our drinks while she sat down, I gave them my fake name as always and when our order was ready and they shouted Tom I went and got it. My gf was a bit confused and asked me if I went and got someone else's order which is fair enough so I explained the thing to her and thought that's that but she got really angry. \n\nShe says it's really disrespectful to lie like that and that I am making everybody in the store out to be creeps who will do something bad if they know my name which is not at all what's happening I just don't like when they yell my real name so I found a harmless way to get around that. But she can't see it like that, she thinks I am a pathological liar who is way to suspicious of everyone and I need to stop. I really can't see the problem she has, it's really not that deep. \n\nI don't think I am hurting anyone... or am I?? So yeah I am really confused by her reaction and asking myself if I am the asshole after all for some reason I can't comprehend.

I didn't want a room full of strangers knowing my name. Not that I thought they were going to do anything wrong. But it's just a personal thing and I don't need my name being broadcast to the whole store. My name is personal I share it with friends.\n\nSo when I'd go to Starbucks or someplace, I'd give a fake name, but I'd do something really funny so the baristas knew it was a fake name and I was just being silly. Like I'd use Pierre or something like that. In fact in Barnes & Noble the baristas there started calling me Pierre whenever I came in, and they thought it was the funniest thing. They knew it was a fake name, but it was like a joke between us. It was a lot of fun!\n\nSometimes I would just say my name was \"22,\" so they would call out \"22\" when my drink was ready, like in the old days where you would just get a ticket with a number on it. The baristas didn't care. They would write down whatever I told them, and they thought it was funny. Brightened their day a little bit. \n\nBut even if you don't use a silly name, who cares if you use a different name? I'd say your girlfriend definitely has issues. If I had to guess I'd say maybe she's been lied to a lot in her life, maybe by her father, and so she's ultrasensitive to people who don't speak the truth even if in insignificant things. That would be my guess.\n\nNTA", "Lmao what?
