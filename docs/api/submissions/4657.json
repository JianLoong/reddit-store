I just can't believe your dad ate all 15 cakes by himself, and it was said not to eat them. I hope I'm not wrong, when I say someone's likely hidden them for a laugh", "Does ur mother know? What did she say?", "NTA - You would totally NTA if you stopped. But don't stop baking if it's something that brings you happiness, but make it very clear that your father is not welcome to the treats unless he asks. And don't tell him to ask, make him figure that out on his own. It will take him a while but when he sees the other people in your life getting treated by giving you respect, he should (hopefully) figure it out. But don't stop baking, because it's something you enjoy. Never let people stop what makes you happy. Or make like, his least favorite thing.\n\nI don't know how old your father is, but I've noticed men of a certain generation just expect things like this handed to them. My own father still treats me (31F) like a teen who just got their license. I had to blatantly tell him that if he doesn't treat me with the respect I deserve, I won't see him anymore. Respect goes both ways. \n\nRemember - Your feelings are valid and you deserve happiness. Don't let someone else take that away.", "NTA. You don't need to bake for them if you don't want to.\n\nBut... avoid any dramtic \"I'll never bake for my family again\" announcements. If your dad won't respect a request to keep hands off, he'll likely react poorly to such a declaration.\n\nAnd honestly, you don't even need to stop baking for them completely. That would be punishing everyone for the misdeed of one. You just need to recognize that you have a family member that lack respect for you and/or self control. Then set your plans and expectations accordingly.\n\nIf you care what happens to the baked goods, bake them somewhere you know is safe. School or a friends house.\n\nBake at home only when you don't care. When you do bake there, bake with the expectation that dad will continue to swipe the goods.\n\nIf he doesn't and its a one time thing, great. If he does continue this, it will at some point start to become an issue with your mom and brother who won't be getting their share either. Their outrage as other family members who are missing out will be more persuasive in resolving the issue than your current outrage as the baker with other plans for the goods.\n\nSide note, if you must bake at home for people or events outside the home, be sure you're buying your supplies seperately from the normal home pantry supply. You didn't say anything on that either way, but it could be a factor.\n\nIf your dad's reason involved a lack of respect, it may be in part an attitude of \"My money paid for the supplies to bake them, I'm going to eat as many as I want\". Its a very lousy attitude to have. But some people will still go there.", "NTA\n\nThats completely your choice.
