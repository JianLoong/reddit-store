I just can't believe your dad ate all 15 cakes by himself, and it was said not to eat them. I hope I'm not wrong, when I say someone's likely hidden them for a laugh", "Does ur mother know? What did she say?", "NTA - You would totally NTA if you stopped. But don't stop baking if it's something that brings you happiness, but make it very clear that your father is not welcome to the treats unless he asks. And don't tell him to ask, make him figure that out on his own. It will take him a while but when he sees the other people in your life getting treated by giving you respect, he should (hopefully) figure it out. But don't stop baking, because it's something you enjoy. Never let people stop what makes you happy. Or make like, his least favorite thing.\n\nI don't know how old your father is, but I've noticed men of a certain generation just expect things like this handed to them. My own father still treats me (31F) like a teen who just got their license. I had to blatantly tell him that if he doesn't treat me with the respect I deserve, I won't see him anymore. Respect goes both ways. \n\nRemember - Your feelings are valid and you deserve happiness. Don't let someone else take that away.", "NTA. You don't need to bake for them if you don't want to.\n\nBut... avoid any dramtic \"I'll never bake for my family again\" announcements. If your dad won't respect a request to keep hands off, he'll likely react poorly to such a declaration.\n\nAnd honestly, you don't even need to stop baking for them completely. That would be punishing everyone for the misdeed of one. You just need to recognize that you have a family member that lack respect for you and/or self control. Then set your plans and expectations accordingly.\n\nIf you care what happens to the baked goods, bake them somewhere you know is safe. School or a friends house.\n\nBake at home only when you don't care. When you do bake there, bake with the expectation that dad will continue to swipe the goods.\n\nIf he doesn't and its a one time thing, great. If he does continue this, it will at some point start to become an issue with your mom and brother who won't be getting their share either. Their outrage as other family members who are missing out will be more persuasive in resolving the issue than your current outrage as the baker with other plans for the goods.\n\nSide note, if you must bake at home for people or events outside the home, be sure you're buying your supplies seperately from the normal home pantry supply. You didn't say anything on that either way, but it could be a factor.\n\nIf your dad's reason involved a lack of respect, it may be in part an attitude of \"My money paid for the supplies to bake them, I'm going to eat as many as I want\". Its a very lousy attitude to have. But some people will still go there.", "NTA\n\nThats completely your choice. You could also just not bake for your dad, maybe only bake for special occasions when you feel like it.", "NTA, but your father is. And those that don't speak up against his actions. He betrayed you.", "NTA \u2014 I would talk to your mom and ask if she can help replace the ingredients. Then just surprise your classmates\u2014 they\u2019ll understand!\n\nAnd make sure you put a big \u201ckeep out or pay for ingredients\u201d warning on them!", "NTA \u2014 I would talk to your mom and ask if she can help replace the ingredients.

Was there anything obvious placed on these to make sure that your family knew those ones weren't for them?\n\nAlso, your classmates will totally understand and love you just as much if you make them for your class when you're feeling better.", "I would but I don\u2019t have a room, me and my brother share one haha. I think I\u2019ll keep baking at school", "I think her dad might be the party sub guy.", "I\u2019m certain, the container I set them in had crumbs and frosting smeared", "Thank you, and they were in a separate container. on the ones for my classmates, I added another larger dot of frosting, the container was also labeled \u201cfor school, don\u2019t eat\u201d", "Then NTA, continue to bake for your family but definitely let your dad know that it was not appreciated for him to take what was clearly labeled for someone else. \n\nHe was probably just being a dope and didn't notice it. He'll look closer next time if he knows it upset you. \n\nHave fun baking! It's a great way to share love in the world.", "Didn't notice and totally completely forgot that OP told him, specifically, not to eat them because they were to be given away at school?\n\nHonestly, sounds more like he didn't think the friends deserved them, so he ate them all because he's more important.", "No, not at all. I just know that sometimes Dads can have a lot on their mind and/OR they often don't pay as much attention as they should.   \n\n\nI do not think he ate them maliciously. I don't think it was cool of him to eat them. I also don't think that a family feud should be started over what is probably an absentminded action. Nor do I think she should stop doing something she loves without actually talking to him and letting him know it was definitely not appreciated. Dads are humans. Humans do dumb shit all the time.  \n\n\n\"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.\"", "Even if he did it as an \"absentminded\" thing, he's still an AH.\n\nWho eats and entire container full of a dozen cakes all in one sitting while everybody else is sleeping???\n\nEven if they weren't marked as being saved, it was an AH move.\n\n... also that saying needs a corrolary: \"Not everything that can be explained by stupidity wasn't actually malicious.\"", "I'm a dad. I also have severe ADHD as well as a lot on my mind. And if I saw a container of individual fresh baked goods on the counter, even without being told anything, I'd never touch them without asking first. It's called common courtesy. In OP's case, her dad was TOLD that those are for her class, and she also baked an entire freaking cake for the family. If this happened to me, even if I forgot about being told, seeing them would remind me of it. And even if I didn't, again, it's common freaking courtesy to ask before eating fresh baked goods that are packaged up to go somewhere. \n\nThere's no excuse for ANYONE to do something like this. Dad's an AH, OP is not.", "Yeah, you're right. He's probably just a spiteful old, crotchety prick that likes to make life hard for his kids. After all, that's exactly what most Dads do, right?", "Anyone who eats an entire container of individual desserts in the middle of the night who doesn't also live alone is an AH.\n\nI don't know why you insist on carrying water for an AH, but here we are.", "You're right! Let's get a shovel and bury this awful Dad! He's the worst! We definitely need less points of view and obviously more hate! Yours is obviously the only accurate one! Of 8 Billion people in the world, only the view of him being a horrible human could be the accurate one. As a new era arrives, instead of Hitler, this Dad can be the new face of evil. Thanks for changing my mind!", "NTA\n\nBake only healthy stuff like whole grain breads with LOTs of fiber. Add a handful or two of mashed up beans or lentils. Add a big glug of olive oil.\n\nIt is impossible to pig out on this type of baked goods.\n\n(These kinds of bread are delicious made with sour starter. Use half all purpose flour and half any mix of whole grains and legumes you like.)", "NTA. If they ask, tell them you are trying new hobbies.", "NTAH.  While you can't leave your family physically, you can mentally walk away.  Bake later, or bake and give it away quickly.  Or bake at a friends house.  Or get a job as a baker at a bakery.", "NTA. 15?????? Holy cow", "NTA but if you didnt buy the ingredients for the finished product you probably should have found a way to share with your folks. Even on a very limited basis. (I am the family baker too).", "NTA. But, OP, address it with your dad.
