I told her I wasn\u2019t having a lot of fun but that I would be back to help clean up and take her home.\n\nI left with my friends and after 20 minutes she ended up texting me and said don\u2019t bother coming back and that she has help from her friend\u2019s and her mother would take her home. \n\nThings have been really weird since then and she told me what I did was rude and inconsiderate of her feelings and that she wanted me there.

Her saying she does things with you when she\u2019s not interested isn\u2019t being manipulative, it\u2019s her expressing she feels an imbalance in how you support each other.", "YTA - and you shouldn't have to ask.  You blow off your girlfriend's birthday party to go out with friends and then ask if YTA?  What you have just made clear to her is that your preference in music is more important than she is.  I would expect that she will be wondering what other trivial things are more important than she is as well.", "YTA. Completely and totally.\n\nLeaving your gf's party only because you didn't like the music is a clear sign that you don't care even a little bit for your girlfriend and have narcissistic tendencies.\n\nNot everything is for you. If you love someone, you are supposed to be at their birthday FOR THEM.\n\nFingers crossed she wises up and dumps you.", "\u201dBe happy I showed up\u201d is something you say to a distant aquaintance that you don\u2019t even like, *not* something you say to your girlfriend!\n\nGood grief, YTA, and honestly I would be amazed if you still have a girlfriend in a week", "YTA. You claim you love her but couldn\u2019t handle one day of doing something she wants on her birthday.\n\nAre you ever thankful or grateful that she does stuff with you that she doesn\u2019t enjoy but puts up with? She\u2019s putting effort into the relationship, I don\u2019t see how you putting in an hour and then ditching with friends to a bar is putting in the same level of effort. \n\nRelationships are about compromise and not always doing what you want. Telling her she should be grateful her boyfriend even bothered to show up is laughable. I would have dumped you on the spot. You don\u2019t sound ready for an actual relationship if this is how you treat your girlfriend. Especially on her birthday.", "YTA\nthe Blue Whale has the biggest asshole on the planet, you sir, make it seem small.", "YTA \n\nYou absolutely could have and should have sucked it up about the music. In a relationship, we do stuff sometimes that we don't love because we care about the person we're dating.

She\u2019s your girlfriend, dude. It was her BIRTHDAY, and you brought friends to her party, hung out with them and when they were bored after an hour you dipped, and went to a bar. Even though she asked you not to and to spend some time with her, and that it would mean a lot to her. You fucking suck, bro. \n\nYour friends could have left, you didn\u2019t need to go with them. This is someone you say you love. I fully do not understand it. Do you hate disco more than you love your girlfriend?\n\nETA - calling her manipulative is so uncalled for. She pointed out that she does stuff that she\u2019s not interested in with you bc you enjoy them. You seem really selfish. And she wanted to have fun WITH you. After you left her party, she likely didn\u2019t have any fun.", "YTA. Part of being in a relationship is being there for your partner even if it\u2019s not really your thing. Like it was her birthday, one night a year. You could\u2019ve sucked it up and stayed. Instead you just torpedoed that relationship and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this is the beginning of the end.", "Yep, YTA. We all put up with shit we don\u2019t like for the people we do like. That\u2019s not even just bf/gf, that\u2019s human relationships in general.", "YTA\n\nIt was her birthday party, if you like/love her, you'd suck it up for the night. Instead, you ditched her for your friends at her birthday party!! OP, you suck.", "YTA. Sometimes you sacrifice your time for the people you care about. You basically told your girlfriend that she's not important enough to you. That her birthday was less important than hanging out with your friends. When you could have hung out with your friends any day, and your girlfriends birthday only happens once a year.", "YTA. She should find a new boyfriend. A guy who can at least feign an interest in her interests.", "YTA. You were rude and inconsiderate, also very selfish. You don't sound like you're capable of compromising and I don't think you should be in a relationship until you learn how.", "I am dying at the thought this guy thinks not vibing with the music is a valid reason to leave hahaha. Staying at your girlfriends birthday party the whole time is the bare minimum. You should be staying the whole time AND be involved with her when she wants. It's literally one day. How entitled are you. If your friends want to leave, then let them. \n\nJust because you have a right to something, doesn't mean you cant be an asshole when you exercise that right. \n\nI respect you admitting you projected your Exes on hyour GF when she explained why why was upset. But the fact you think you were reasonable at all is crazy to me. You left your GF on her birthday! She could be playing baby shark and you should stay. Its one day ff sake hahaha", "Dude, you\u2019re so oblivious it\u2019s comical. You sound fairly immature in this relationship. Your gf was asking for your support (she shouldn\u2019t even have to ask) and you bailed on her. \n\nLet that sink in\u2026 she asked you to be there for her and you left to drink with your buddies. It\u2019s a small sacrifice for someone you care about. \n\nOf course YTA.", "YTA if you only ever do things that you want to do you will still be a bachelor at 90. \nYour girlfriend wanted you to celebrate her birthday with  her and she asked you not to leave because it would mean a lot if you stayed. You need to wake up to the concept of give and take before your girlfriend gets fed up with being the giver.", "I'll said a big, huge YTA. And a friendly reminder: you should be nicer to your girlfriend before someone else does it.", "YTA for...\n\nleaving her birthday party\n\nand for even asking if YTA...", "YTA\n\nAttending a loved one's party is not a show up and leave event. It is a get there early, help with set-up, food, etc; stay the whole time, as another host; and then clean up after. That you did none of these AND left early; well, I think you'll not have a GF for long.", "YTA wow please stay single, you don\u2019t deserve a gf if that\u2019s how your going to treat them. She\u2019s lucky you even showed up!? You are her bf, you should be the first one there and the last one to leave but doesn\u2019t seem like you you care about anyone but yourself", "\u201cI know it\u2019s your birthday and this day is supposed to be special for you and all about you, but even though I am fully capable of staying in going to choose not to. I\u2019m going to abandon you and your crap party to go and do what I want, because I am the most important person in my life and I will never prioritize you over me. Be grateful I even showed up at all.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s basically what you told her. Also, when all her friends ask where you went, she has to come up with an excuse, because she can\u2019t just tell the truth and say you left because you\u2019re selfish, because what an embarrassing thing to admit about your partner.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Sometimes in life you're not going to be doing exactly what you want where you want.", "YTA. You should have stayed for her. The music not being your taste didn\u2019t matter.", "YTA. You hurt your girlfriend. You then gaslighted her.\n\nThanks a lot for asking AITA and considering an outside view to reflect on yourself. Hope you will:\n- apologise to her\n- not be an AH with her again \ud83d\ude4f\n\n(Even if it was only friends or buddies I would be pissed\u2026)", "Of course YTA can\u2019t believe you even have to ask. It\u2019s her birthday you\u2019re supposed to do what she wants even if it\u2019s not your thing you\u2019re supposed to support her! You are a lousy boyfriend.", "YTA. Good luck keeping a girlfriend when you prioritize \"vibing with music\" over your significant other.", "YTA. In addition to hurting her feelings because you \"weren't feeling the music\" you probably embarrassed her in front of her mother and friends. It was really lame of you to leave.", "You seem like a very selfish person who only likes to do things if it benefits you. \n\nWhen multiple people have told you that, they do things only you enjoy and you think it's manipulative shows how self centered you can be in a relationship.\n\nYou showed up to HER birthday with group of your friends and then ditched her to go bar hopping, and you really can't see how YTA in this situation? \n\nSeriously, life isn't always about you, sometimes you do things you don't like to make someone else happy. This was one of those times. YTA", "YTA and very self centered", "YTA. It was her birthday and you chose to ditch the party after one hour, after she asked you to stay. \n\nBirthdays happen once a year, and it doesn't sound like she's constantly dragging you to things you hat. You should have sucked it up.", "YTA - in your eyes, she should just be happy you bothered to show up and stay an entire hour at an event that didn\u2019t revolve around you. How dare she be upset that you bailed on a party celebrating her and embarrassed her by revealing how little you care - you graced them with your presence, which was gift enough.", "YTA, roles reversed I\u2019m sure she\u2019d stay at your birthday party even if she didn\u2019t like the theme/music. Not only that, you ditched her to hang out with your friends at a bar. You\u2019d be my ex pretty darn fast after that", "YTA. You just showing up wasn\u2019t \u201creally nice\u201d like you say, it was the bare minimum you would do for a casual friend, let alone your partner.", "YTA man. its ok to not like the music, but you clearly showed your gf that spending time with your friends on HER birthday is more important than spending time with her even with some poor music. How is that not obvious to you.", "HUGE AH. \nYou abandoned her on her birthday by giving such a lame excuse. It's her birthday you could've sucked it up and stayed there for her. Just not feeling the music because it's not your type. Ew what a shit excuse dude. I hope she plays disco music at your doorstep on loud speakers! \n\n>. I told her at least I showed up even though that was not my type of setting and she should be grateful that I came, and I didn\u2019t need to be there the whole party \n\nWere you doing a favour to your own girlfriend by being at \"HER BIRTHDAY PARTY\"? How ignorant are you exactly? You're the one making her upset and manipulating her and you feel manipulated? Lol the irony. \n\n>I feel like me at least showing up was really nice and I even offered to come back and clean up but she said no\n\nOmg yes. YOU are such a big personality she should be grateful that you made the courage to get up from your bed and come to \"HER BIRTHDAY PARTY\" and also make it about yourself by leaving. Wow how ungrateful she is! \nGrow up you entitled doofus!", "OP you should take a hard look at the people in your life. If you want a healthy future for yourself and your kid it would make a lot of sense to surround yourself with folks who support what\u2019s best for you *as a whole*\u2014not just the moment.  \n\nShe may very well be your ex at this point and that may not be a bad thing. You have a lot of growing to do as a person and you have responsibilities as a dad\u2014that\u2019s a lot to handle at once.  If you do stay with this woman it should be an active choice because you love her, want what\u2019s best for her *as a whole*, and are willing/able to have an equitable relationship with her. Right now it sounds very one sided and you shouldn\u2019t want that for someone you care about.", "Jfc are yta. Either commit to being childishly selfish and single or a decent human being in a relationship.", "YTA", "YTA. She wasn't being manipulative you were just being called out on being a shitty boyfriend and didn't like that. Hopefully one of the friends who actually stayed at the party with her convinces her she deserves better because you sound like you definitely don't deserve her.", "Ah to be yong and stupid again, yeah mate YTA on this one, you don't leave your girlfriend's birthday party because you don't like the music.", "YTA It was only one day. Her day. It wouldn't have killed you to stay. If in her shoes I'd be rethinking the relationship with you.", "YTA it was her birthday party, how selfish are you that you couldn't suck it up for one evening.\n\nIf she's consistently doing stuff that interests you more than her shows a complete imbalance in your relationship and she should really think if you're even worth it.", "YTA You didn't just leave, you took other party guests to your idea of a \"better party\" and then came back afterwards.\n\nJust leaving would have been fine--that was fun babe, I'm gonna go home and sleep now. But the way you did/said it made it clear you don't care about her and can't muster going through a few hours of what she wants to do *even on her birthday* (the one \"ok they own this day\" event of the year).", "YTA she should be grateful bc you did the bare minimum and showed up to her birthday party for one hour?!? Do you even hear yourself? When you love or care for someone sometimes you go to events that are not your thing bc you want to show your support. You should have stayed. Your girlfriend is not being manipulative by expressing her feelings and the imbalance in your relationship. She doesn\u2019t have to be asked to do certain things for you bc she just does them to be a good partner. It would be nice if you could do the same for her.\n\nEdit for typos", "Honestly do men date women they secretly hate? I don\u2019t get this", "YTA. You're toxic bro. What do you mean you wanted to go hang with your friends. Your gf is supposed to be one of your closest friends", "INFO does your GF use Reddit? Because we would love to explain to her how a GOOD BF behaves, help her realize she doesn\u2019t owe you \u201cappreciation\u201d for simply showing your ass up, and show her how to better understand her own value and worth, so she can find a partner who understands as well.\n\nOh, and YTA", "You're not into disco OP?

All relationships require some give and take. You don't have to be constantly entertained. Sometimes, just being there for someone you care about should be enough. If you want to continue this relationship, I would make some changes.", "Nope, what you did wasn't nice at all and she should NOT be grateful that you ditched her on her birthday. What you did was selfish and inconsiderate. One year one of my friends wanted to go to a bar that played nothing but Broadway showtunes. I don't like those songs. But I put up with it for one night because it was my friend's birthday. YTA", "YTA. Also you are too immature to be in a relationship. Just go hang with your bros at bars and leave this poor girl alone", " YTA god i hope she dumps your ass", "Aww. Poor baby didnt like the music.  AWWWW.  You could have stayed before taking off  with your friends.  Kiss this relationship goodbye.\n\nYTA.", "Glad to see you know you were kinda TAH. For future, if it's your partners birthday and they want you there, then you go and act happy about it because the day isn't about you. Make her feel extra special on her b day", "YTA \n\nYa.. man.  Just bad rookie move.  If you actually care about this girl, you stay whether you hate the music or not because it\u2019s not about that.. or you.  It\u2019s about her.  A couple hours is nothing if you really care about someone.  \n\nI mean shit.  I went to see Benjamin Button and Georgia Rule.  Both movies were painful to me as well as some others my wife has picked.   But then I dragged her to Snakes on a Plane opening night.  So.  She definitely loves me too:D.  \n\nUnsolicited advice: If you want to keep her and be good to her.  Apologize.  Many flowers or whatever she likes.  And take her to a disco yourself.  Shit.. put on a white jumpsuit and dance as long as she wants to.", "I would\u2019ve said not AH until she directly told you how much it would\u2019ve meant to stay around so YTA. You could\u2019ve survived for the night. That being said, I despise being in these situations feeling pressured to stick around in a setting I have no interest in. One hour is short though. I try to make it at least two and I\u2019ll try to find things to do. While it sucks, it pays to do these things to build/maintain relationships. For future events, try to plan in things that would keep you interested. For me, it\u2019s various types of games.", "ESH.  OP sucks for not powering through it, or at least better planning an exit strategy.  The GF sucks for making a big deal about her 23rd bday, and pumping disco music.  The OP\u2019s friends for not giving him better advise.", "ESH\n\nYou because it\u2019s your GF. It\u2019s her birthday.
