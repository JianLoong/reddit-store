My wife wanted to keep her last name for much less emotional reasons and more because name-changes are a pain in the ass, especially for someone who had done 3 already in her life (one from when her dad left, she took her mom's last name, one from a previous marriage, and once back to her maiden name after douchenugget dipped out to be a mamma's boy).\n\nAs for his specific points, they're easy arguments to counter.\n\n1) Tradition does not equate better. Cultural norms throughout history and around the world are constantly shifting and challenged. If someone wants so badly to lean on \"tradition,\" they can take their ass back to the medieval age and find themselves some house wench to tend to their home while they plow a field by hand.\n\n2) You'd be addressed by your names just like anybody else. We have first names, most people use them throughout their whole lives.\n\n3) Why is it emasculating? His status as a man is not hinged on having a woman change her identity to fit some arbitrary social stigma. And if his family can't accept you for the person you are, it might not be a family worth marrying into. Because marrying him means marrying into his family and being connected to that whole clan in some capacity.\n\n4) See point 3. What negative repercussions? It's a name. It's not a cosmic contract that will alter the course of destiny and tear the foundations of time and space asunder. \n\n5) OK? He wants you to take it. You want to keep it. One of you has to give up their wishes for the other, there's no getting around that. Either one of you lives with giving up what they want, or neither of you give up what you want and you go your separate ways.", ">1.

We were born with a surname with which we navigated through life and achieved all our different accomplishments, it's ultimately your choice if you want to give it up and start a new chapter with a new last name. \n\nNow, from what you tell us, your boyfriend has few red flags: \n\n1) seems he cares more about what the others (\"the others\" Who? Your close friends know how important is your last name to you and they will respect your choice.) might think than your own will and feelings. \n\n2) How would you be addressed? By your names. I mean, just like now. I don't see the big deal.\n\n3) it's \"tradition\"? It was also tradition that girls got married at 13. It was also tradition to marry being a virgin (both males and females). It was tradition to sleep in different bedrooms/beds. It was tradition to have s*x just to have children. It was tradition many things, but they changed. \n\n4) if your last name it's this enormous problem, I'm worried how you will get through real problems once married. Will he keep scoffing off your opinion and feelings like this? Will he keep trying to manipulate you to get things his way? If this is what awaits you,don't do it. \n\nLast but not least: what kind of negative ripercussions could he face? A side-eye from his family?

I would be concerned that he will not prioritize you when making other major decisions if all that's in his headspace is how he will be perceived by others.

He seems to care a lot about what his family think. This might become an issue in the future when he takes more into account their opinions instead of yours when it comes to decision making. Are you prepared to being put last behind his family all the time?\n3. He seems to think certain things aren't masculine for him. Do you two split the chores and responsibilities at home? How does he behave when it comes to common house chores? Does he think cooking and washing dishes and general home chores aren't a man's work? How is he with his feelings and emotions? Or does he lack emotional intelligence and maturity because \"big men don't cry\"?\n4. There's really no repercussions to you not taking his name. If he thinks he is going to be bullied by his family and/or friends for you not taking his name are you willing to form part of their lives? If you're marrying him you're marrying into his family with his outdated views.
