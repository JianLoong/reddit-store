My wife wanted to keep her last name for much less emotional reasons and more because name-changes are a pain in the ass, especially for someone who had done 3 already in her life (one from when her dad left, she took her mom's last name, one from a previous marriage, and once back to her maiden name after douchenugget dipped out to be a mamma's boy).\n\nAs for his specific points, they're easy arguments to counter.\n\n1) Tradition does not equate better. Cultural norms throughout history and around the world are constantly shifting and challenged. If someone wants so badly to lean on \"tradition,\" they can take their ass back to the medieval age and find themselves some house wench to tend to their home while they plow a field by hand.\n\n2) You'd be addressed by your names just like anybody else. We have first names, most people use them throughout their whole lives.\n\n3) Why is it emasculating? His status as a man is not hinged on having a woman change her identity to fit some arbitrary social stigma. And if his family can't accept you for the person you are, it might not be a family worth marrying into. Because marrying him means marrying into his family and being connected to that whole clan in some capacity.\n\n4) See point 3. What negative repercussions? It's a name. It's not a cosmic contract that will alter the course of destiny and tear the foundations of time and space asunder. \n\n5) OK? He wants you to take it. You want to keep it. One of you has to give up their wishes for the other, there's no getting around that. Either one of you lives with giving up what they want, or neither of you give up what you want and you go your separate ways.", ">1.

We were born with a surname with which we navigated through life and achieved all our different accomplishments, it's ultimately your choice if you want to give it up and start a new chapter with a new last name. \n\nNow, from what you tell us, your boyfriend has few red flags: \n\n1) seems he cares more about what the others (\"the others\" Who? Your close friends know how important is your last name to you and they will respect your choice.) might think than your own will and feelings. \n\n2) How would you be addressed? By your names. I mean, just like now. I don't see the big deal.\n\n3) it's \"tradition\"? It was also tradition that girls got married at 13. It was also tradition to marry being a virgin (both males and females). It was tradition to sleep in different bedrooms/beds. It was tradition to have s*x just to have children. It was tradition many things, but they changed. \n\n4) if your last name it's this enormous problem, I'm worried how you will get through real problems once married. Will he keep scoffing off your opinion and feelings like this? Will he keep trying to manipulate you to get things his way? If this is what awaits you,don't do it. \n\nLast but not least: what kind of negative ripercussions could he face? A side-eye from his family?

He seems to care a lot about what his family think. This might become an issue in the future when he takes more into account their opinions instead of yours when it comes to decision making. Are you prepared to being put last behind his family all the time?\n3. He seems to think certain things aren't masculine for him. Do you two split the chores and responsibilities at home? How does he behave when it comes to common house chores? Does he think cooking and washing dishes and general home chores aren't a man's work? How is he with his feelings and emotions? Or does he lack emotional intelligence and maturity because \"big men don't cry\"?\n4. There's really no repercussions to you not taking his name.

If you're marrying him you're marrying into his family with his outdated views.

Her father passed away recently, so she wanted to keep his last name.

It was a nobrainer bc neither of us had to get new documents, new signatures etc. And it really doesn't matter. Sometimes i use his lastname (for example at the vet bc our pets were registered under his name, they were his pets before) and sometimes he uses my lastname if we are registered somewhere under my name. No biggi. I don't mind being called mrs \"his lastname\" and he doesn't mind being called mr \"my lastname\".\n\nIf this already leads to an argument, you may not both be ready for marriage yet, mindset wise.", "Before we got married, my now husband and I had the exact same discussion. He brought up the same arguments your bf did, and I said, \"Well, let's not get married then.\" A few years later and we're married. Guess what, I kept my name, he kept his, and everything's fine. Sometimes people just need to grow up. And: NTA, if this is important to you, stand your ground.", "NTA. My sister & BIL have been married for 8 years & she hasn't changed her last name. It's not a matter of principle or sentiment; it's \"laziness\" on her part. It's a ton of paperwork to deal with & she gets enough of that as a paralegal, lol. But, because they are married, she sometimes receives mail addressing her with BIL's last name. I don't know about Niece (she's 2), but I know she has her dad's last name on her birth certificate (it's a given in the US, unless Mom says otherwise). BIL doesn't care & (as far as I know) his family hasn't made a stink about it.\n\nThe real problem is your fiance. \"It's not traditional for you to keep your last name when you marry me\", \"My family will harass me because you kept your name\", \"I'll be emasculated by you keeping your name\".

Why guys get all butt hurt over their beloved's desire to keep her own last name is beyond me.", "NAH\n\nYou're not married and this is an important conversation to have before you get to that point. There are all sorts of societal expectations that are important to consider. Whether bfs opinions are a bit outdated or not doesn't warrant AH status for him if you're still at the early stages of discussing these things.\n\nSome other things to consider - I know some mums with different surnames to their children being held up whilst travelling intentionally for fear of kidnapping. Outdated, yes but stressful.\n\nA double-barrelled surname (his-yours or yours-his) might be a solution if neither of you want to \"lose\" your last name.\n\nGL to you both", "3. is a red flag for me.

It says something that this option seems to have been forgotten.", ">1) Tradition does not equate better.

How OP's partner views of a particular tradition is just as valid as OP's, regardless of societal norms or evolution of traditions. Suggesting plowing a field by hand is somehow equivalent is asinine. In some countries, you can ONLY get married if the married couple adopt the same surname. In other countries, people MUST keep the same surname for life.\n2. First names aren't the issue here.\n3. You are saying someone's feelings about their own gender identity are not valid here, which is pretty shaky ground. If OP's partner feels this aspect of marriage is important to them and breaking this tradition would be emasculating to them, who are you to say they are wrong for feeling this way? Nobody is having something done to them against their will here, it's a discussion about what's important to each person. They are expressing their views. Compromise (from all parties) is a big part of successful marriage, as I'm sure you know.\n4. Considering the views of your family is important and should be one factor that feeds into decision making (how important obviously depends on individual circumstances). Yes it's just a name, but you don't have to try very hard to see the tribalism drive in human nature to understand why someone might have strong feelings about it, even if you don't.\n5. Mostly agree with this, but suggesting they call off the relationship is a bit extreme. Other solutions not already mentioned include combining/hyphenating the surnames they both clearly feel attachment to, or even picking an entirely new one so the stigma of taking someone else's name is removed altogether.\n\nI don't think anyone is the asshole here, it's just a difficult and emotional conversation to have that sounds like it's not gone very smoothly. Nobody has been wronged (yet!), and there's still roads to agreement. Hope they get it worked out.\n\nNAH.\n\nEDIT: I'm not saying that the bride taking the grooms surname is the right thing to do AT ALL. Just trying to advocate for keeping the conversation honest, open and respectful.", "Agree.\nMarried over 20yrs. Wife didn't take my name, not a big deal it doesn't bother me at all.\n\nMy brother got married a few years ago, his wife was the same.Only difference there is they have a kid who has the fathers name so when she wants to travel with the child she needs a letter or similar as the names on the passports are different..
