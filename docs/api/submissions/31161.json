{"id": 31161, "submission_id": "17xj72c", "title": "AITA for renting out my sister's apartment?", "selftext": "My sister (19) has lived with me (35) since she was 7. Even before her parents let her move in with me, I was always the one taking her to school, staying home with her if she was sick, figuring out childcare for holidays, going to parent teacher conferences, and I even coached her soccer and tee ball teams. I got married when she was 12 and had my son when she was 14.\n\nShe wanted to move out for college last year so my husband and I bought a 2 bedroom condo for her. She didn't pay any rent, just her groceries, HOA fees (around $50 a month), and her utilities. We also got her a car and paid for everything except gas. She was only living a little over an hour away so we tried to visit her 1-2 times a month and she came home at least one weekend a month.\n\nMy sister got bacterial meningitis a little over a month ago. She spent 3 weeks in the hospital and she's been home for 3 weeks. She was really sick. She even lost some of her vision and hearing and struggles with balance, focus, and short term memory. She was told that she wouldn't be able to go back to school for the spring semester.\n\nMy sister is getting better but she can't take care of herself yet. I've been staying home to take care of her and she struggles to get to the bathroom on her own, I wait outside of the shower for her in case she falls or needs help. My husband and I talked and we decided to clear out her apartment and rent it out. There's so many schools near us that she could go to, I want her to stay local for a while.\n\nI told her yesterday that we're going to clear out her apartment and rent it out and that we want her to stay local when she is able to go back to school. She did not take it well. She cried, yelled at me for taking her apartment away, said I'm being controlling by making her stay local, and a couple other things. She's never been this mad at me so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.\n\nEdit: I do not appreciate the comments calling my sister spoiled or an \"entitled monster\". I know I didn't adopt her but she's still my kid. She got so sick and pretty much lost everything right after becoming \"independent\". Of course it's going to be hard for her. If you can't find anything better to say about my kid you do not need to leave a comment on this post.

I think your sister is reacting to the sad news of her diagnosis. She had a taste of independence and now it\u2019s all been taken away from her. Give her grace.", "NTA- you said she cried about you taking away \u2018her\u2019 apartment, when in actuality the apartment is yours, and you were kind enough to buy it for her to use, along with all the other things you\u2019ve done for her. Bottom line, her view of reality is skewed due to her age and level of maturity. \n\nYou sound like an amazing big sister, I\u2019m sure someday she\u2019ll realize this.", "NAH. Bypassing the whole \"woah, what happened there\" with you raising your sister for most of her life, I'm thinking this is all a reaction from all that has happened to her in regards to getting sick and needing to come home. She was just starting to get a taste of adulthood -- college, an apartment, a car -- and then she got *really* sick, has to take an extended break from school, and live at home because she now needs help doing basic things. It makes total sense to hopefully temporarily, but maybe long term (depending on her recovery), rent out \"her\" apartment, but I'm sure it just feels like another thing taken away from her, and all of her anger at ::waves hands around:: everything is coming out about this one thing.\n\nIt's a lot to process. Perhaps some therapy might help her to process this huge change and her new reality.", "NAH.  I've been in your sister's shoes.  Her reaction is a culmination of all the stress and disappointment she's been under, fear--especially of an uncertain future one since she has essentially fallen off course of what she had envisioned/planned pretty much all her life-- the frustration from the loss of independence,  shame because she is no longer moving \"forward\" in life, etc...\n\nLogically, she may understand why you and your husband plan on renting out her apartment.  But she can't do logic for that right now.  She has so little agency/control of her own right now.  The apartment represents the independent her, the her whose life felt on track, who felt confident, or at least somewhat secure, about the direction her life was moving in.  It represents a healthy her.\n\nYou and your husband renting it out would have sucked to her either way, but to make the decision and then TELL her what is happening, as well as your decision (want) that she stay local when she does start going to school again months, if not a year or so from now, is devastating.  It strips her of any notion of independence, of any sense of agency.  Disease robbed her of control over much of her body.  Her life essentially came to a complete stop, even while the world around her and everyone's lives--friends, family, etc...--continue on without her.  When this happened to me in college, my apartment, where I had lived independently and so on, was so important to me even though I knew I couldn't keep it nor could I care for myself on my own at the moment.  I still cried and grieved over having to lose it, still became angry and lashed out at my parents who, ultimately, was the deciding factor that I was to leave it even though they did speak to me about it beforehand and I knew, despite all my arguing, that I could not live there alone.  Even now, years later, I can understand the reasoning and logic behind the decision, but I still struggle with feeling anything positive about losing the apartment.  \n\nThe apartment had been my ultimate safe space and losing control over my own body/health was bad enough but to lose all that, have to move back in with my parents whom I could not disassociate from my being a child and dependent, and to suddenly have so many decisions made FOR me, was,..well, it's something I'm still recovering from mentally and emotionally.  In some ways, when the decision was made to give up the apartment, I felt like I wasn't just giving up an apartment but like it was giving up hope of my getting better and back to the point of independence--not just necessarily myself, but as if others did not believe I could overcome this current struggle.  Logically, it's not the case at all but when not even your own body will listen to you, very little about logic can overtake what you *feel*, which at that time, is pretty much all you have to be able to claim as your own.\n\nIt's difficult, having experienced independence, to lose it indefinitely.\n\nEven moreso when you KNOW the other party is truly doing it because they care about you.  But at this time, you can't even consider using the bathroom without wondering if you are troubling the other person--you basically have the bodily control of a baby but the mind of an adult.  Your sister will go through the emotional and mental gamut in addition to her physical struggles.  Unfortunately, you and your family, in being both those closest to her and the ones who exercise the most control over her and her life at the moment, will likely also bear the brunt of her frustrations and anger as she works through this major disappointment in life.   Much of her actions will, in fact, be reactions, and pretty much all of it will stem from her feeling lost and uncertain about her future, or of any independent future, and whether she will acknowledge that to be the case or not, lashing out from it.\n\nFind some way to give your sister some sense of control over *something* because right now, she has none whatsoever.  And while physical recovery isn't easy, it's a hell of a lot easier than what she will need to face mentally and emotionally.", "NTA, but you could have handled it better. NTA b/c it wasn\u2019t \u201cher\u201d apartment to begin with. \n\nThat being said, it would have been kinder to come up with a plan *with* her, rather than *for* her.\n\nedit: it sounds like you are amazing sister, who is also going through a hard time. we can\u2019t show up in all the ways all the time.", "NAH\n\nI get this is a hard time for her, and it would be nice if she was able to weigh in more.  But the truth is, she's not independent, which means that sometimes her hand is going to be forced because the other people she depends on for her support cannot support her in the way she would like.\n\nYou have a *young child* at home.  You cannot live indefinitely with your sister no matter how much she would prefer that because your child needs their mother.  You need to return home *to your husband and child*.  And if your sister needs care and cannot live alone, that means she has to return with you (or find another caregiver).  And if she has to return to your home, it makes no sense for you and your husband to pay for an apartment that is sitting empty.  Of course you should rent it out.\n\nIt sucks that your sister, an adult, has no say over this.  But that's sometimes how it shakes out.  Of course you have a right to decide for yourself that you need to return to your home with your family, and if your sister needs to follow you for the care she needs...that's that.  And of course you have a right to make your own financial decisions that are best for you.  It sucks that your sister again has no say, but that's sometimes how it shakes out when your bank account isn't the one paying the bills.  \n\nI understand why she's upset, but you have to make the decisions that are right for you and your family.  When your sister is able to be more independent, she will have the same right to make those decisions for herself.  But that's not how things are right now.", "NAH.  This is a tough situation.  Your sister's life was essentially turned upside down by her medical issues.  While I'm sure she's grateful for all the help you've given her, she probably viewed that apartment as a goal to get to after the bacterial meningitis.  Now that has been taken away from her.  \n\nYou're doing what's best for her, though, from what it sounds like.  She needs help and you can't do that when she's an hour away.  I don't think her anger is fully at you for this.  It's probably a lot of frustration over what's happened to her.", "NTA\n\nMainly because you have paid for everything she has.\n\nYWBTA if you make this a permanent arrangement and never let her go back to her home. If it is for 6 months then fine, but any longer than that would be unfair on her. you should let her get back to her life.", "Soft, YTA. I understand you own the apartment, but she's in a fragile state now and you took away the little control left she had over her life. You should have discussed this with her prior. Imagine you were sick and someone decided it's a good time to take your home away from you. Unless money was an urgent problem I think you could have handled this differently. I would have discussed this with her first if I were you.", "NTA.  It isn't her apartment it is your condo that you let her use.  If she wants an apartment she can buy or lease one.  She's been spoiled for a long time and its hard for her to deal with not getting what she wants.", "Undecided on judgement: \n\n. You've done many generous things to make her life better than it would have been otherwise. She's not entitled to a free apartment. It's horrible that she's had this illness and I hope she recovers soon. I can, however, see her point that you're making decisions about where she will be going to school and telling her that she's going to change her whole life, after she's just adapted to college.  She's just had her first taste of independence and now probably feels like you're taking that away too. Her dr thinks she can't go back for spring semester but what do they say about Summer or Fall? If there's no medical need for her to be close to you, then I don't see why she shouldn't return to school where she was. \n\nAny chance some of your decision making had more to do with you missing her being around (since she's really more like a daughter than sister) and want her to be closer? You have to let her leave the nest and if her dr says ok for her to go back then I don't see why on earth you'd force her not to.", "NTA", "YTA. You've been wonderful to her, but you've just made a significant decision about her life and didn't even discuss it with her.", "YTA for making the decision without her. She is already feeling depressed and lost and upset over everything that\u2019s happening and then you just decided to give up her apartment and telling her to go to a closer school without talking to her about it.", "I think taking her home for the time being is fine but where you cross into asshole territory is when you tell a 19 yo adult where she has to go to school you can want her to stay locally but forcing her is where your wrong bring her home for the 9 months she can\u2019t be in school see how she recovers and go from there if she\u2019s able to take care of herself and continue school where she\u2019s at let her leave the school conversation for later on just bring her home and help her get healthy bc it\u2019s clear she can\u2019t be on her own rn and there\u2019s no sense in the apartment sitting empty for the 9 months she\u2019s with you \nAlso I think your really amazing everything you\u2019ve done for your sister is really great and I hope she sees that and I\u2019m sure your just worried about your sister rn and acting out of fear just take some time to work through your fear and readdress the situation I usually don\u2019t comment but I see a lot of people being extremely harsh towards you and felt you could use some compassion", "NTA. You have provided for your sister for years and have been taking care of her during her illness. It's understandable that you want her to stay local for now, considering her health and the support she needs. You have her best interests at heart and are doing what you think is best for her.", "Light YTA Renting out the apartment while she can't use it makes sense.  But I think you should be more open minded about trying to force her to stay local for school when she's able, especially if her school was close enough to visit often.  If she regains her health and independence, why can't she go back to her other school?", "YTA You are not trying to be mean but she is more than old enough for you to have discussed this with her. You were trying to be helpful and to support her. However, her whole life has changed as a result of this illness, even if some of this is temporary. It may have felt like the final blow for her because you took the faint hope that things may go back to normal. She is probably grieving her old life a little and feeling scared. You are probably also scared too because of all she\u2019s been through. I hope you can both find common ground.", "YTA. Not necessarily for having her live closer to her and closing out her apartment, but for making those decisions without consulting her.\n\nLook. Her life has just changed drastically and she doesn't know what the future holds. That's scary and removed a lot of her agency without her consent. Not that diseases bother with consent.\n\nAnd what did you do? Change her circumstances again, so she doesn't know what the future holds. You removed her agency without her consent or even consulting with her. That's scary! Of course she lashed out.\n\nInstead, talk to her about what she things the future should be. If she wants to live in the apartment how does she plan to do that? She's an adult. You can't make unilateral decisions for her. She has to participate in those decisions.\n\nSince it's your apartment you can, of course, kick her out of it following whatever tenant/landlord laws in your area. But isn't it better to discuss it with her first, especially since you think you're doing it for her own good?", "YTA for the way you went about this. You needed to discuss this with her and reach a decision with her; instead you and your husband are making life choices for her behind her back. That isn't on. I think your ideas are sensible, but you acted like an AH nonetheless.", "NTA. If she wants to stay there and figure out care then she should do it.  You should return home to your family and let her figure out how to get 24 hour care. Otherwise you will be the bad guy. \n\nSometimes tough love is necessary.  Get her in touch with a disability social worker and leave.  Maybe she can make it work out.", "NAH.\n\nI understand why your sister is upset - it feels like you're being controlling after she's had a taste of living independently.  But there are extenuating circumstances here.  Your sister needs care until she is able to live independently again, ad that is going to take time.  It's probably frightening for her to deal with being this sick and incapacitated, and she is lashing out against needing to be cared for.  I'll bet there's a lot of mis-directed anger that's being taken out on you.\n\nDo you own the condo, or is it in her name?  If you own it, you are perfectly within your rights to rent it out, especially if you are paying taxes, a mortgage, etc., and you are not currently working. Also, you are probably paying the utilities and HOA fees right now while your sister can't.  \n\nMaybe your approach to your sister about staying local and living with you came off as if the decision was already made with no input from her.  I would try to sit down and talk things through with your sister when she's calmer, and explain that you are concerned about her living alone while she needs so much care and time to heal, and that you didn't mean to make a unilateral decision about her life.  Then ask her how she's feeling and what she wants to do while she's recovering.", "NTA. She wants you to continue being her full time caregiver, and sponsoring an apartment that she physically cannot occupy for 9-12 months? Yes she\u2019s in a touch situation but she\u2019s being ungrateful and unrealistic.", "YTA\n\nShe has lost so much physical freedom\n\nAnd now you take away her emotional freedom\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou shouldn't be trying to keep her local, you should be encouraging her to take a longer break to focus on herself, in the space she feels most comfortable; her apartment.", "YTA for making the decision without talking with your sister first.\n\nYou want her to stay local but she's 19 and she has the right to decide if she wants to stay with you or go back to her life.

You want her to switch schools, then switch schools again if she wants to later?  \n\nYou say she's just paying the HOA fee, so it's not as if you can't leave it empty for some time.\n\nRenting it out is going to be for at least a year, so you are essentially using it force her to change schools because I'm pretty sure you're not going to pay for another condo.", "Info: do you share the same parents and where are they?", "NTA she\u2019s very fortunate to have one provided to her rent free and to have you in her life. How long is the rental for with new tenants?", "NTA - I\u2019ve been really really sick before and all you want is for life to go back to normal. So is she being unreasonable? Yes absolutely. But I suspect it\u2019s coming from a place of frustration because this is that reality check that her life is going to be \u201con hold\u201d for awhile. She isn\u2019t where she wants to be and she isn\u2019t doing what she wants to be doing. \n\nIt is absolutely not your fault though, and you have been incredible generous to her.

She should be appreciative for that alone, but I do understand that once you've tasted a little independence when it is taken away, it's hard.  However, your love for your sister is immense and once she is healthier, you need to let her get her independence back.  You're a wonderful sister and I hope one day she realizes it and is thankful the great life you gave her.", "NTA. You are basically her mom. She needs you. She doesn't understand life and her financial cost to your generosity as taking the place of her mom. Putting her needs above yours. You guys have been super generous. Buying her a car. Getting her a condo fir school. That is above and beyond. Seems you may have unintentionally created an entitles monster. She needs to have some hard truths. You are trying to help her get to go to college despite what her doctors said by starting by trying school locally. If she can succeed, then she can try moving out. But at this point, letting her condo out makes perfect sense!", "NTA - you aren't taking away HER apartment, you are making a decision about YOUR Apartment.", "NTA.  Please remember her reaction is like grief, her brain is still recovering and it hadn't even finished developing.  Don't take it personally, I think you've made a sensible decision both for her safety and wellbeing, and financially for you.  Plenty of time for her to go back to the other school for post grad later.  Good on you guys, you've got this.", "INFO: Wait why does she have to be local? Confused why you made the choice without asking her what she wanted. Will she not be able to take care of herself by then?", "YTA for how you did this.  It looks like she's more your daughter than your sister.  She was raised by you.   So she's 19, in college, and she gets sick, and as her parental figures you made a final decision about her future without discussing it with her AT ALL. Parents get so shocked that when kids grow up they can't make responsible, mature decisions but at the same time those parents refuse to allow them into the decision making process. If you spoke with her and presented how you felt and then allowed her to speak her side and have an adult grown up conversation, then maybe should could have seen your point of view but instead you made an authoritative, pretty controlling decision.  As a parent, I can totally see your point of view on the final decision, but I definitely treat my kids a lot more respectfully than you did and the result is that they make pretty good decisions without me making them.", "NTA. \n\nGive her some time to process everything. Shes been through a lot. Get her some therapy too.\n\nYou could had talk to her first. Not to ask for permition to rent your apartment that you are paying for, but to let her feel kinda of in charge too about this stuff. But, I get where you came from. Your child had a serious health problem and is still recovering. It will take a while to get back to normal and for her to adjust to her independent life. She cant go back alone because she will not be able to live there alone. And you cant go with her because you have other child and a job to pay for everything, including her life there and her medical bills.\n\nIdk what the arrangment between both of you was, but you bough the apartment where she lived. What will happen when she finish school. She will be paying rent? Will you give her the apartment? I dont know if she understand that the apartment its yours, not hers. \n\nYou have been an amazing sister and basicly a mother to her. You raised her, you have been there in every moment.

If she can't go to the bathroom or shower by herself yet it's not smart. And I disabled myself, medical bills add up. I do think you should've included her is the discussion more.

My best wishes that she gets better.", "NTA - she just needs time. Her independence has taken away from her and you\u2019re the easiest person to be mad at. Knowing that the apartment won\u2019t be available is the nail in the coffin. But you\u2019re doing nothing wrong. \n\nAlso, you\u2019re just renting it out. There\u2019s nothing to say she can\u2019t move back there in the future. You didn\u2019t sell it. You\u2019re being a great sister.", "Right. I\u2019d say NAH, because I\u2019m guessing the sister\u2019s reaction here is more a reaction to the fact that she doesn\u2019t really have any control over her life right now. \n\nBeing sick enough to be hospitalized for three weeks is terrifying, both for the patient and their loved ones. She probably thought she was going to die at least once during that hospitalization. And even now, she can\u2019t even pee or shower by herself. She can\u2019t control anything about her life at all, and I\u2019m betting the apartment thing was sort of the last straw that made her break down. \n\nAnd I\u2019m sure OP was afraid too! She almost lost one of the people she loves most in the world and now she has to watch that person still be so weak and frail. This has been such an awful and scary experience for the whole family, and I can\u2019t blame any of them for feeling the way they feel right now. \n\nIf OP had a time machine, I\u2019d say she and her husband should talk to her sister first about their concerns about having her live on her own so far away from them where they would be limited in how much they can help her, and make a plan together so the sister can get back some of the control she\u2019s lost while OP and her husband can still feel like they can help keep her safe. But that ship has sailed, so the best she can do now is apologize. \n\nSomething like \u201cI\u2019m sorry for making decisions about your life without including you. That was the wrong call. Seeing you so sick and being afraid I might lose you made me think and act in some irrational ways, and I wasn\u2019t thinking about how that might hurt you.

OP is as good as anyone at this.\n\nOP one suggestion though -- if you make a surplus from the rental arrangement, save that money and hold it for her as a get-started-all-over-again fund for if she recovers.  If you get the word that she's not going to recover, which I think is an extreme possibility, then that money can help fund her longterm care.  That way she can still feel like the apartment is a little bit hers even if she can't use it right now.", "I suggested this in another place -- if OP makes a surplus from the apartment, maybe share that surplus with sister in some way.  Perhaps let her use some of it as \"mad money\" or save it for a fund to help her eventually make the apartment handicap accessable.  Some way to make it feel like the apartment is still a little bit hers.  It'll go a long way to helping soothe her hurt.", "She can't drive and it would take at least 2-3 hours to get there using public transportation.", "Look up bacterial meningitis, what it is, what it does, and what the implications are for 19 year old who is still recovering being able to make any final decisions.  Then report back and tell me if you still agree with what you just wrote.\n\nLet's jusst say that I feel that the age of consent argument is not pertinent to survivors of serious brain damage.  Meningitis is literally an attack on the brain.  It's a buildup of fluid in the brainpan that squeezes your brainmeats like a sponge.   \\]\n\nHer brain was literally crushed under the weight of several pounds of fluids.  That's why she's having so much trouble doing basic things and it's why she probably isn't competent to live alone right now anyway.  \n\nThe crushing of her brainmeats robbed her of a large chunk herself and what remains to be seen is how much she can get back with the brain's inbuilt ability to rewire itself around that damage.  Could be everything, could be next to nothing, it's impossible to know right now.  Taking her recovery slowly and doing one semester closer to home are perfectly reasonable options and until she recovers more completely 19 absolutely can't make decisions for herself.  She's simply not competent until her recovery is more complete.", "Maybe tell her that the apartment is there for her in the future when she is well and able to go back to it.  You want her to stay local so you can help until she is 100% well.   Your first priority is to help her succeed.", "Agreed.\n\nI feel for the sister a lot. I was in my second year of university when I ended up in a coma. I had to learn to walk and talk again. It's taken years of rehabilitation to get better\n\nBut the worst part wasn't the event itself or the rehab. It was a loss of freedom and independance. Everyone treated me like a fragile piece of glass. I wasn't allowed out by myself or to live by myself. I wasn't even trusted to take my own medication. I was treated like I was 3 years old. It feels horrible to live like that. Or rather \"existing\" but not really living.\n\n12 years later I have my first job. I'm about to move into MY first place. I still have memory issues and health problems, but 2023 has been the happiest year for me in a long, long time.\n\nI truly hope the sister gets better soon and OP sounds an amazing sibling but I hope OP doesn't fall into the trap my family did with me. It's a very difficult situation", "Did you communicate the timeline and that you\u2019re going to do everything you can to get her back to a healthy young lady", "Indeed, I've been an RN for 30yrs and seen a great deal, and the last thing anyone with brain injury of any origin needs is rushing to get back to their premorbid state.", "F19 is an adult.  What you expect is for her sister to abandon her own family and stay with her in this apartment and care for her.  The sister wants her to move back home so she can take care of her and also her own family.  This seems reasonable to me. \n\nF19 is being unreasonable in her request to require her sister to stay with her in the apartment.  The sister has a 2 year old child at home who also needs her.  If F19 refuses to move, then you think that this requires the sister to abandon her own child.  \n\nF19 will quickly realize that she can't make it on her own.", "Ignoring the longer break part, I see...\n\nThey are saying encourage her to take a longer break before going back to university, giving her more time to improve and gain her independence back.", "I hope you have an even better 2024!!", "There is no law setting a time line for college. Sister is too sick to attend, that is no one's fault, but there's no point paying for a vacant condo. You act like it's now or never and that is ridiculous.", "Which is one of the reasons that sports have been forced to deal a lot more seriously with concussions, which are also brain damage.  People like Antonio Brown or Aaron Hernandez who were literally driven insane by it, or NHL veteran Derek Boogaard who decided to unalive himself due to severe CTE-related depression, are why you don't minimize the risks of brain damage.", "I'm sorry, that's nonsense.  The kid recovering from literal brain damage doesn't get a vote if the outcome could result in harm to them.  \"x is an adult\" is a terrible argument when X isn't in a physical or mental state to care for themselves.", "F19 has been staying with OP and her family since she got out of the hospital. OP has not been abandoning her family and F19 is not asking her to. You\u2019ve completely missed the point of the whole post. \nIt has nothing to do with OP having to choose between her child or her sister. It has to do with F19\u2019s doctor recommending that she not return to school until the Fall and OP wanting F19 to continue to stay with them for that Fall semester to make sure she can handle school, work, and living on her own while continuing to recover from the literal brain damage she endured in the course of her illness. \nSince this will leave the condo empty for a year OP wants to rent it to help with cash flow since she is not working while she takes care of her sister and to help recover the money she is spending on medical bills, increased utilities and food bills and the F19 is upset about the loss of independence. \nDid you even read it?", "its 100% understandable.  Honestly your child is going through a lot of pain, loss and disappointment. I would expect her to swing from loving, to anger to tears and everything in betwee. Yours will swing to\n\nJust love her. Maybe get her a therapist who can help her cope with her near death experience. And know this internet stranger has her fingers and toes crossed that everything works out for all of you", "Absolutely.  I don't know any of the people you have mentioned (I'm from the Antipodes), but Rugby Union is considered our national sport, so we spend a lot of time talking about traumatic brain injury now, trying to discourage the causal use of concussion as it downplays the seriousness of what's happening.  So while I know I'm singing to the choir talking to you now, I'm doing so for anyone reading to just take an extra second to look after themselves and others.", "I'm not sorry, but you don't know what you are talking about.  Let's say the sister isn't in the picture.  Now we have a 19-year-old with brain damage.  Lots of them out there.  Adults are treated differently in the system than children.  You want to have her treated like a child, where the system will try to find family support. The F19 wants to be treated like an adult and make decisions.", "Hah.  I must have been remembering the previous version of this story.  You caught me.", "Your mistake was treating her like a child and not young adult. You are making all of these decisions for her without discussing your thoughts with her. And whilst you have been a generous and supportive sister/parent, that makes YTA in my opinion. I know you are coming from a place of concern and you may well be right that she is better staying close to home, talk to her.", "I'd be upset if someone said I had leave the school I chose and go to a different school that they wanted me to go to instead", "NTA - I am sure this has been a huge emotional and financial drain on you. She is probably afraid she will never get back to where she was physically and mentally- best you can do is reassure her this is temporary until she can function safely again on her own and that it would be helpful to you to have the rent money to insure she has what she needs", "\"Stay local when she is able to go back to school.\"  So, wait, you want her to transfer from her current school to go to one close to you?  For how long?  Do they have the major she's on?  Will she lose credits doing so?  Are they equal in quality? Have you really looked at any of this?", "NTA. \n\nExplain its not forever, just during her recovery period. \n\nYou sound amazing OP - Your sister is so lucky to have you :)", "Keep in mind that meningitis is not only terrifying and harmful in the short-term, but can also cause depression and personality changes. This is a brain injury. Of course little sis\u2019s emotional responses are going to be out side the range of what one might expect. She will hopefully learn to regulate her emotional and cognitive reactions again, but it takes time. Give her (and your little family) some grace. It\u2019s hard. We are cheering for you all. You\u2019re NTA.", "This is a hard situation for you. I had viral meningitis 3 times in my life. That was hell but only for a few days and I had zero side effects (I don\u2019t actually know if viral meningitis has side effects, it is the least dangerous meningitis) so I can\u2019t imagine what your sister is going through. NTA for wanting her to be local for awhile. Why don\u2019t you rent the condo out with a lease of only 6 months with the condition that you might not renew the lease. Then make the decision about your sister\u2019s continued education after you see how well she recovers. If she\u2019s fit enough let her go back to her chosen university for fall semester. If she\u2019s not, have that talk with her then. I\u2019m 46 and due to surgeries and complications from it all, I have been where your sister is with losing my balance and some abilities, needing someone there while I shower. It was hard at 39. I can imagine at her age losing her independence along with the rest of her losses I never experienced, it has to be tough. She\u2019s not going to react well with losing yet another piece of her life and independence. At her age she could recover quick enough to return for fall semester next year. And if not, keep the condo on a month to month lease so you can give it back to her when she\u2019s recovered. This will also give her a goal to work towards in her recovery. You\u2019re a loving sister/mother figure to her that just wants the best for her. Good luck and I hope she can recover sooner rather than later!", "YTA for spoiling her too much. Now she\u2019s turned into a entitled spoiled jerk and you can\u2019t see anything wrong? You\u2019re what\u2019s enabling her to be like this because you refuse to see that she\u2019s wrong. She\u2019s going to end up becoming a horrible lonely person because of you.", "NAH. She is probably struggling with the loss of independence...she went from being an able bodied 19 year old who had her own place to depending on you to do basic care for her. It is hugely difficult for a lot of people to cope with being disabled at first.\n\nI would have probably asked her first though, instead of telling her what is going to happen. Because then it takes away what little control she had, and makes her feel dependent and forced her to face her life is really really changed and its not going to be a short stay and then she can get back into things in a few months. (Bad analogy, but my mom used to smoke when she was terminally ill because it was one of the few things she had control of at the end...I imagine it's something similar for her. Even if it's not good for her, she wants it so she can prove to herself she can still have some of her old life back.) I don't think you meant to be unkind but it probably hurt her a lot. \n\nHowever, if it's financially feasible I'd probably put the profit (if any) from renting her place out into an account for her. You can turn it into a thing for her...maybe a fund for a trip when she has more of a handle on her condition, or something.", "NTA but maybe approach her again, but with an end date. Discuss that it's going to be an extended period of time before she recovers and there's no point in letting the apartment sit empty for that. Can you do a year to year lease and when your sister is recovered she can go back to living independently? It might even give her a goal to work towards", "NTA\n\nThat is a lot of money to be spending on an empty apartment while she is going to need the costs of additional care during her recovery. She may not like it, but she isn't the one paying her expenses.\n\nIt's a struggle to be unwell and need others to care for you, but her reaction is selfish and not even remotely thinking of the financial burdens you are WILLINGLY BEARING on her behalf.\n\nAs an aside, this is why many colleges require the meningoccocal vaccine to live on campus. So if anything, I hope someone takes that lesson away from this to get vaccinated because meningitis can take away your limbs, hearing, vision, or even your life.", "Do you need the money from the rental?\n\nIf I were in her position it would feel really awful to be told that my solo living situation was being taken away from me and that people were going to handle and pack up all my stuff.\n\nI feel like broaching the topic more gradually (like asking what her thoughts were) would have been a much better start.", "NTA, but maybe you and your husband sit down with her and talk. She is still sick, and maybe that's more the frustration about the situation that she behaves like this", "I'm not sure where you are, but it's often not that easy to just go to another school like you make it seem."]}
