{"id": 31161, "submission_id": "17xj72c", "title": "AITA for renting out my sister's apartment?", "selftext": "My sister (19) has lived with me (35) since she was 7. Even before her parents let her move in with me, I was always the one taking her to school, staying home with her if she was sick, figuring out childcare for holidays, going to parent teacher conferences, and I even coached her soccer and tee ball teams. I got married when she was 12 and had my son when she was 14.\n\nShe wanted to move out for college last year so my husband and I bought a 2 bedroom condo for her. She didn't pay any rent, just her groceries, HOA fees (around $50 a month), and her utilities. We also got her a car and paid for everything except gas. She was only living a little over an hour away so we tried to visit her 1-2 times a month and she came home at least one weekend a month.\n\nMy sister got bacterial meningitis a little over a month ago. She spent 3 weeks in the hospital and she's been home for 3 weeks. She was really sick. She even lost some of her vision and hearing and struggles with balance, focus, and short term memory. She was told that she wouldn't be able to go back to school for the spring semester.\n\nMy sister is getting better but she can't take care of herself yet. I've been staying home to take care of her and she struggles to get to the bathroom on her own, I wait outside of the shower for her in case she falls or needs help. My husband and I talked and we decided to clear out her apartment and rent it out. There's so many schools near us that she could go to, I want her to stay local for a while.\n\nI told her yesterday that we're going to clear out her apartment and rent it out and that we want her to stay local when she is able to go back to school. She did not take it well. She cried, yelled at me for taking her apartment away, said I'm being controlling by making her stay local, and a couple other things. She's never been this mad at me so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.\n\nEdit: I do not appreciate the comments calling my sister spoiled or an \"entitled monster\". I know I didn't adopt her but she's still my kid. She got so sick and pretty much lost everything right after becoming \"independent\". Of course it's going to be hard for her. If you can't find anything better to say about my kid you do not need to leave a comment on this post.

I think your sister is reacting to the sad news of her diagnosis. She had a taste of independence and now it\u2019s all been taken away from her. Give her grace.", "NTA- you said she cried about you taking away \u2018her\u2019 apartment, when in actuality the apartment is yours, and you were kind enough to buy it for her to use, along with all the other things you\u2019ve done for her. Bottom line, her view of reality is skewed due to her age and level of maturity. \n\nYou sound like an amazing big sister, I\u2019m sure someday she\u2019ll realize this.", "NAH. Bypassing the whole \"woah, what happened there\" with you raising your sister for most of her life, I'm thinking this is all a reaction from all that has happened to her in regards to getting sick and needing to come home. She was just starting to get a taste of adulthood -- college, an apartment, a car -- and then she got *really* sick, has to take an extended break from school, and live at home because she now needs help doing basic things. It makes total sense to hopefully temporarily, but maybe long term (depending on her recovery), rent out \"her\" apartment, but I'm sure it just feels like another thing taken away from her, and all of her anger at ::waves hands around:: everything is coming out about this one thing.\n\nIt's a lot to process. Perhaps some therapy might help her to process this huge change and her new reality.", "NAH.  I've been in your sister's shoes.  Her reaction is a culmination of all the stress and disappointment she's been under, fear--especially of an uncertain future one since she has essentially fallen off course of what she had envisioned/planned pretty much all her life-- the frustration from the loss of independence,  shame because she is no longer moving \"forward\" in life, etc...\n\nLogically, she may understand why you and your husband plan on renting out her apartment.  But she can't do logic for that right now.  She has so little agency/control of her own right now.  The apartment represents the independent her, the her whose life felt on track, who felt confident, or at least somewhat secure, about the direction her life was moving in.  It represents a healthy her.\n\nYou and your husband renting it out would have sucked to her either way, but to make the decision and then TELL her what is happening, as well as your decision (want) that she stay local when she does start going to school again months, if not a year or so from now, is devastating.  It strips her of any notion of independence, of any sense of agency.  Disease robbed her of control over much of her body.  Her life essentially came to a complete stop, even while the world around her and everyone's lives--friends, family, etc...--continue on without her.  When this happened to me in college, my apartment, where I had lived independently and so on, was so important to me even though I knew I couldn't keep it nor could I care for myself on my own at the moment.  I still cried and grieved over having to lose it, still became angry and lashed out at my parents who, ultimately, was the deciding factor that I was to leave it even though they did speak to me about it beforehand and I knew, despite all my arguing, that I could not live there alone.  Even now, years later, I can understand the reasoning and logic behind the decision, but I still struggle with feeling anything positive about losing the apartment.  \n\nThe apartment had been my ultimate safe space and losing control over my own body/health was bad enough but to lose all that, have to move back in with my parents whom I could not disassociate from my being a child and dependent, and to suddenly have so many decisions made FOR me, was,..well, it's something I'm still recovering from mentally and emotionally.  In some ways, when the decision was made to give up the apartment, I felt like I wasn't just giving up an apartment but like it was giving up hope of my getting better and back to the point of independence--not just necessarily myself, but as if others did not believe I could overcome this current struggle.  Logically, it's not the case at all but when not even your own body will listen to you, very little about logic can overtake what you *feel*, which at that time, is pretty much all you have to be able to claim as your own.\n\nIt's difficult, having experienced independence, to lose it indefinitely.\n\nEven moreso when you KNOW the other party is truly doing it because they care about you.  But at this time, you can't even consider using the bathroom without wondering if you are troubling the other person--you basically have the bodily control of a baby but the mind of an adult.  Your sister will go through the emotional and mental gamut in addition to her physical struggles.  Unfortunately, you and your family, in being both those closest to her and the ones who exercise the most control over her and her life at the moment, will likely also bear the brunt of her frustrations and anger as she works through this major disappointment in life.   Much of her actions will, in fact, be reactions, and pretty much all of it will stem from her feeling lost and uncertain about her future, or of any independent future, and whether she will acknowledge that to be the case or not, lashing out from it.\n\nFind some way to give your sister some sense of control over *something* because right now, she has none whatsoever.  And while physical recovery isn't easy, it's a hell of a lot easier than what she will need to face mentally and emotionally.", "NTA, but you could have handled it better. NTA b/c it wasn\u2019t \u201cher\u201d apartment to begin with. \n\nThat being said, it would have been kinder to come up with a plan *with* her, rather than *for* her.\n\nedit: it sounds like you are amazing sister, who is also going through a hard time. we can\u2019t show up in all the ways all the time.", "NAH\n\nI get this is a hard time for her, and it would be nice if she was able to weigh in more.  But the truth is, she's not independent, which means that sometimes her hand is going to be forced because the other people she depends on for her support cannot support her in the way she would like.\n\nYou have a *young child* at home.  You cannot live indefinitely with your sister no matter how much she would prefer that because your child needs their mother.  You need to return home *to your husband and child*.  And if your sister needs care and cannot live alone, that means she has to return with you (or find another caregiver).  And if she has to return to your home, it makes no sense for you and your husband to pay for an apartment that is sitting empty.  Of course you should rent it out.\n\nIt sucks that your sister, an adult, has no say over this.  But that's sometimes how it shakes out.  Of course you have a right to decide for yourself that you need to return to your home with your family, and if your sister needs to follow you for the care she needs...that's that.  And of course you have a right to make your own financial decisions that are best for you.  It sucks that your sister again has no say, but that's sometimes how it shakes out when your bank account isn't the one paying the bills.  \n\nI understand why she's upset, but you have to make the decisions that are right for you and your family.  When your sister is able to be more independent, she will have the same right to make those decisions for herself.  But that's not how things are right now.", "NAH.  This is a tough situation.  Your sister's life was essentially turned upside down by her medical issues.  While I'm sure she's grateful for all the help you've given her, she probably viewed that apartment as a goal to get to after the bacterial meningitis.  Now that has been taken away from her.  \n\nYou're doing what's best for her, though, from what it sounds like.  She needs help and you can't do that when she's an hour away.  I don't think her anger is fully at you for this.  It's probably a lot of frustration over what's happened to her.", "NTA\n\nMainly because you have paid for everything she has.\n\nYWBTA if you make this a permanent arrangement and never let her go back to her home. If it is for 6 months then fine, but any longer than that would be unfair on her. you should let her get back to her life.", "Soft, YTA. I understand you own the apartment, but she's in a fragile state now and you took away the little control left she had over her life. You should have discussed this with her prior. Imagine you were sick and someone decided it's a good time to take your home away from you. Unless money was an urgent problem I think you could have handled this differently. I would have discussed this with her first if I were you.", "NTA.  It isn't her apartment it is your condo that you let her use.  If she wants an apartment she can buy or lease one.  She's been spoiled for a long time and its hard for her to deal with not getting what she wants.", "Undecided on judgement: \n\n. You've done many generous things to make her life better than it would have been otherwise. She's not entitled to a free apartment. It's horrible that she's had this illness and I hope she recovers soon. I can, however, see her point that you're making decisions about where she will be going to school and telling her that she's going to change her whole life, after she's just adapted to college.  She's just had her first taste of independence and now probably feels like you're taking that away too. Her dr thinks she can't go back for spring semester but what do they say about Summer or Fall? If there's no medical need for her to be close to you, then I don't see why she shouldn't return to school where she was. \n\nAny chance some of your decision making had more to do with you missing her being around (since she's really more like a daughter than sister) and want her to be closer? You have to let her leave the nest and if her dr says ok for her to go back then I don't see why on earth you'd force her not to.", "NTA", "YTA. You've been wonderful to her, but you've just made a significant decision about her life and didn't even discuss it with her.", "YTA for making the decision without her. She is already feeling depressed and lost and upset over everything that\u2019s happening and then you just decided to give up her apartment and telling her to go to a closer school without talking to her about it.", "I think taking her home for the time being is fine but where you cross into asshole territory is when you tell a 19 yo adult where she has to go to school you can want her to stay locally but forcing her is where your wrong bring her home for the 9 months she can\u2019t be in school see how she recovers and go from there if she\u2019s able to take care of herself and continue school where she\u2019s at let her leave the school conversation for later on just bring her home and help her get healthy bc it\u2019s clear she can\u2019t be on her own rn and there\u2019s no sense in the apartment sitting empty for the 9 months she\u2019s with you \nAlso I think your really amazing everything you\u2019ve done for your sister is really great and I hope she sees that and I\u2019m sure your just worried about your sister rn and acting out of fear just take some time to work through your fear and readdress the situation I usually don\u2019t comment but I see a lot of people being extremely harsh towards you and felt you could use some compassion", "NTA. You have provided for your sister for years and have been taking care of her during her illness. It's understandable that you want her to stay local for now, considering her health and the support she needs. You have her best interests at heart and are doing what you think is best for her.", "Light YTA Renting out the apartment while she can't use it makes sense.  But I think you should be more open minded about trying to force her to stay local for school when she's able, especially if her school was close enough to visit often.  If she regains her health and independence, why can't she go back to her other school?", "YTA You are not trying to be mean but she is more than old enough for you to have discussed this with her. You were trying to be helpful and to support her. However, her whole life has changed as a result of this illness, even if some of this is temporary. It may have felt like the final blow for her because you took the faint hope that things may go back to normal. She is probably grieving her old life a little and feeling scared. You are probably also scared too because of all she\u2019s been through. I hope you can both find common ground.", "YTA. Not necessarily for having her live closer to her and closing out her apartment, but for making those decisions without consulting her.\n\nLook. Her life has just changed drastically and she doesn't know what the future holds. That's scary and removed a lot of her agency without her consent. Not that diseases bother with consent.\n\nAnd what did you do? Change her circumstances again, so she doesn't know what the future holds. You removed her agency without her consent or even consulting with her. That's scary! Of course she lashed out.\n\nInstead, talk to her about what she things the future should be. If she wants to live in the apartment how does she plan to do that? She's an adult. You can't make unilateral decisions for her. She has to participate in those decisions.\n\nSince it's your apartment you can, of course, kick her out of it following whatever tenant/landlord laws in your area. But isn't it better to discuss it with her first, especially since you think you're doing it for her own good?", "YTA for the way you went about this. You needed to discuss this with her and reach a decision with her; instead you and your husband are making life choices for her behind her back. That isn't on. I think your ideas are sensible, but you acted like an AH nonetheless.", "NTA. If she wants to stay there and figure out care then she should do it.  You should return home to your family and let her figure out how to get 24 hour care. Otherwise you will be the bad guy. \n\nSometimes tough love is necessary.  Get her in touch with a disability social worker and leave.  Maybe she can make it work out.", "NAH.\n\nI understand why your sister is upset - it feels like you're being controlling after she's had a taste of living independently.  But there are extenuating circumstances here.  Your sister needs care until she is able to live independently again, ad that is going to take time.  It's probably frightening for her to deal with being this sick and incapacitated, and she is lashing out against needing to be cared for.  I'll bet there's a lot of mis-directed anger that's being taken out on you.\n\nDo you own the condo, or is it in her name?  If you own it, you are perfectly within your rights to rent it out, especially if you are paying taxes, a mortgage, etc., and you are not currently working. Also, you are probably paying the utilities and HOA fees right now while your sister can't.  \n\nMaybe your approach to your sister about staying local and living with you came off as if the decision was already made with no input from her.  I would try to sit down and talk things through with your sister when she's calmer, and explain that you are concerned about her living alone while she needs so much care and time to heal, and that you didn't mean to make a unilateral decision about her life.  Then ask her how she's feeling and what she wants to do while she's recovering.", "NTA. She wants you to continue being her full time caregiver, and sponsoring an apartment that she physically cannot occupy for 9-12 months? Yes she\u2019s in a touch situation but she\u2019s being ungrateful and unrealistic.", "YTA\n\nShe has lost so much physical freedom\n\nAnd now you take away her emotional freedom\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou shouldn't be trying to keep her local, you should be encouraging her to take a longer break to focus on herself, in the space she feels most comfortable; her apartment.", "YTA for making the decision without talking with your sister first.\n\nYou want her to stay local but she's 19 and she has the right to decide if she wants to stay with you or go back to her life.

You want her to switch schools, then switch schools again if she wants to later?  \n\nYou say she's just paying the HOA fee, so it's not as if you can't leave it empty for some time.\n\nRenting it out is going to be for at least a year, so you are essentially using it force her to change schools because I'm pretty sure you're not going to pay for another condo.", "Info: do you share the same parents and where are they?", "NTA she\u2019s very fortunate to have one provided to her rent free and to have you in her life. How long is the rental for with new tenants?", "NTA - I\u2019ve been really really sick before and all you want is for life to go back to normal. So is she being unreasonable? Yes absolutely. But I suspect it\u2019s coming from a place of frustration because this is that reality check that her life is going to be \u201con hold\u201d for awhile. She isn\u2019t where she wants to be and she isn\u2019t doing what she wants to be doing. \n\nIt is absolutely not your fault though, and you have been incredible generous to her.

However, your love for your sister is immense and once she is healthier, you need to let her get her independence back.  You're a wonderful sister and I hope one day she realizes it and is thankful the great life you gave her.", "NTA. You are basically her mom. She needs you. She doesn't understand life and her financial cost to your generosity as taking the place of her mom. Putting her needs above yours. You guys have been super generous. Buying her a car. Getting her a condo fir school. That is above and beyond. Seems you may have unintentionally created an entitles monster. She needs to have some hard truths. You are trying to help her get to go to college despite what her doctors said by starting by trying school locally. If she can succeed, then she can try moving out. But at this point, letting her condo out makes perfect sense!", "NTA - you aren't taking away HER apartment, you are making a decision about YOUR Apartment.", "NTA.  Please remember her reaction is like grief, her brain is still recovering and it hadn't even finished developing.  Don't take it personally, I think you've made a sensible decision both for her safety and wellbeing, and financially for you.  Plenty of time for her to go back to the other school for post grad later.  Good on you guys, you've got this.", "INFO: Wait why does she have to be local? Confused why you made the choice without asking her what she wanted. Will she not be able to take care of herself by then?", "YTA for how you did this.  It looks like she's more your daughter than your sister.  She was raised by you.   So she's 19, in college, and she gets sick, and as her parental figures you made a final decision about her future without discussing it with her AT ALL. Parents get so shocked that when kids grow up they can't make responsible, mature decisions but at the same time those parents refuse to allow them into the decision making process. If you spoke with her and presented how you felt and then allowed her to speak her side and have an adult grown up conversation, then maybe should could have seen your point of view but instead you made an authoritative, pretty controlling decision.  As a parent, I can totally see your point of view on the final decision, but I definitely treat my kids a lot more respectfully than you did and the result is that they make pretty good decisions without me making them.", "NTA. \n\nGive her some time to process everything. Shes been through a lot. Get her some therapy too.\n\nYou could had talk to her first. Not to ask for permition to rent your apartment that you are paying for, but to let her feel kinda of in charge too about this stuff. But, I get where you came from. Your child had a serious health problem and is still recovering. It will take a while to get back to normal and for her to adjust to her independent life. She cant go back alone because she will not be able to live there alone. And you cant go with her because you have other child and a job to pay for everything, including her life there and her medical bills.\n\nIdk what the arrangment between both of you was, but you bough the apartment where she lived. What will happen when she finish school. She will be paying rent? Will you give her the apartment? I dont know if she understand that the apartment its yours, not hers. \n\nYou have been an amazing sister and basicly a mother to her. You raised her, you have been there in every moment.

If she can't go to the bathroom or shower by herself yet it's not smart. And I disabled myself, medical bills add up. I do think you should've included her is the discussion more.

My best wishes that she gets better.", "NTA - she just needs time. Her independence has taken away from her and you\u2019re the easiest person to be mad at. Knowing that the apartment won\u2019t be available is the nail in the coffin. But you\u2019re doing nothing wrong. \n\nAlso, you\u2019re just renting it out. There\u2019s nothing to say she can\u2019t move back there in the future. You didn\u2019t sell it. You\u2019re being a great sister.", "Right. I\u2019d say NAH, because I\u2019m guessing the sister\u2019s reaction here is more a reaction to the fact that she doesn\u2019t really have any control over her life right now. \n\nBeing sick enough to be hospitalized for three weeks is terrifying, both for the patient and their loved ones. She probably thought she was going to die at least once during that hospitalization. And even now, she can\u2019t even pee or shower by herself. She can\u2019t control anything about her life at all, and I\u2019m betting the apartment thing was sort of the last straw that made her break down. \n\nAnd I\u2019m sure OP was afraid too! She almost lost one of the people she loves most in the world and now she has to watch that person still be so weak and frail. This has been such an awful and scary experience for the whole family, and I can\u2019t blame any of them for feeling the way they feel right now. \n\nIf OP had a time machine, I\u2019d say she and her husband should talk to her sister first about their concerns about having her live on her own so far away from them where they would be limited in how much they can help her, and make a plan together so the sister can get back some of the control she\u2019s lost while OP and her husband can still feel like they can help keep her safe. But that ship has sailed, so the best she can do now is apologize. \n\nSomething like \u201cI\u2019m sorry for making decisions about your life without including you. That was the wrong call. Seeing you so sick and being afraid I might lose you made me think and act in some irrational ways, and I wasn\u2019t thinking about how that might hurt you.

But for someone who is like a parent to her, he reacted like an asshole. He should try to understand how she is feeling and stop treating her like a child. He should take into account her opinion even if he still has the final say. This would at least give her the feeling she has some control over her life.", "She can't use the bathroom or shower by herself. There's no way in hell I'm going to encourage her to live on her own.", "But OP pays for that place. And it was for a specific purpose - attending college. The sister doesn\u2019t pay anything, won\u2019t be going back to school for at least 9 months and not working either. Sister has a right to live wherever she wants as she\u2019s an adult, but OP doesn\u2019t have to pay for it.", "She might be 19 but she can't even use the bathroom or take a shower by herself. She can't drive herself to her PT or OT appointments and can't make any food except for a bowl of cereal or a sandwich. She shouldn't be on her own.", "She's not paying the HOA anymore. There's still the mortgage, wifi, utilities, etc. and there's no sense in paying for an apartment to be empty for 9 months.", "We have the same dad. She hasn't seen them in around 10 years.", "None of us know how she'll do when she's back in school, working, and taking care of herself. I want her to try it at home for a semester so we can learn what she can and can't handle when she has the safety net of me being able to step in and help. I can't run over to her apartment and make her dinner or clean her apartment if she can't do it herself.", "I agree.  I understand why some people think you should have included her more in the decision-making, but that's just not how it works when you're the one paying the bills out of your account.  You need to make the decision that works best for you, for your family, and for your finances.  If she was paying you rent, it might be different.  She could offer to continue to pay you rent to keep the apartment, and that might be a workable compromise.  \n\nBut it's not reasonable to expect *someone else* to pay for you to have an empty apartment.  It's just not.", ">It's not sustainable to pay for an empty apartment\n\nIt should be more sustainable than paying for a full apartment, which is what you were doing before", "So you are taking away the dream of college and a degree as well then. She is now 19 an adult. You have done all this without discussing it with her. Seems like you have already decided her life path. You didn't discuss you told her and there is a very big difference.\n\nYou might want to listen more to your sister.", "What most of you who say NTA fail to take into account is her mental state. OP isn't wrong for wanting to rent the apartment and she should have the final say in what happens to it. But her sister just went through a traumatic experience, her life changed completely and having no control over what happens to you or feeling of security is scary, especially for a 19 year old. OP took away the remaining sense of security and control her sister had. The right way to approach this would have been to calmly explain to the sister why it is a good idea, not force these on her when she's already down mentally and physically. OP didn't do anything wrong in theory, but as a human being and a sister and \"parent\" to her sister, she should have spent some time understanding what her sister is going through.", "The apartment and school are two separate issues. Yes, she can\u2019t live alone right now. Renting out the apartment is reasonable (although she still has a right to have feelings about her loss of independence) but you can\u2019t just decide that she needs to transfer schools.", "Yes, but she's very fragile now, her life was already so out of her control, you didn't have to take the very little control she had left away from her. I'm sure that if you would have discussed this with her and explained why you think this is a good idea she would have understood, maybe not immediately, but eventually. My point is that you could have avoided causing her mental state to get worse by letting her believe she still has some control over her life.", "So talk to her about it first.  Explain the struggle, and make the suggestion. Or ask her to suggest other options to allow her to stay in her apartment.  If she is unwell, can her insurance cover home visits, etc.\n\nJust making the decision for her is controlling. She's an adult who should be part of the discussion, no?", "NTA at all. I'm going to assume anyone saying she's an adult and all has zero idea how she is not able to function right now, and has no choice. She's just sad about it.", "That's not the point. \n\nOf course she shouldn't be alone, but you acted like the decision was made and like the 19 year old woman that she is had to do what you said. You basically acted like she was a child and had no say in her life. \n\nShe has barely any control over her life or her body right now. Don't take away the little control she has left over her life. The decision to stay should have been hers to make for her own mental health. \n\nStop mothering her. She is not a child anymore.", "She's also an adult who deserves to be consulted on decisions that impact her. Don't treat her like a child.", "What wifi, you can shut that off.  HOA was fee was $50.  You were already paying the mortgage.  Presumably at some point you'll sell the property and get some return so you need to pay all the associated fees.\n\nHowever, you are completely missing the point.  You are using the rental to force your sister to stay local.  If she wants to go back, you'll just tell her, \"Sorry, it's rented\".  \n\nIf it were just for the financial reasons my judgment would be different, but you wrote your post.", "Are you her guardian - supporting her financially and was the apartment purchase made solely with your money?", "Honest question since you're bank rolling all of this: what is the viability of letting her try, and if she does end up unable to do it alone, she agrees to come home until she can. This way she gets to try and you aren't put in a position of taking her choices away.\n\nLet her know you cannot help her while she's there, but she can try, and if it doesn't work she comes back while you rent the condo? \n\nActually, you could let her try and be 100% independent while she's still living with you now honestly. If she can do everything on her own then there's less risk when she tries at the condo. And if she can't it will help her realize she's not ready yet but can go back when she is, making you not \"the bad guy\" in her POV. \n\nNAH. Of course she's upset, and while I think she's taking it out on you which is unfair, she's also got a LOT going on and the condo/semester off is just salt to the wound. But you also have a lot going on and you're doing your best.", "Before, she was in the apartment helping to pay for her own expenses, we didn't have any medical bills, and I was working. She can't work, I'm paying for her groceries, increased utilities, new glasses, hearing aids, walker, PT, OT, medical bills, her apartment's utilities, the mortgage, taxes, and everything else all when I'm not working. It's not sustainable.", "Her doctor is the one that doesn't want her to go back to school until the fall. I'm not saying she can never go back to school, but I want her to do a semester at home. It's going to be different. She might not be able to handle driving herself there and back, working to pay for gas, groceries, utilities, etc. and if she tries all of it for the first time away from us she might really struggle.", "Are you a parent? You can't just turn it off the second they turn 18. She's always going to be my kid.", "I was her guardian until her 18th birthday. My husband and I paid for the apartment.", "And if you smother her she will never learn. All I am saying is listen to your sister, don't decide it for her, she is an adult after all.\n\nWhat you have done for her is fantastic, but if she loses all the life skills she was building while she was independent because you are codling her, that is a step backwards. Let her have a say!", "I get that. But she's not a kid anymore. She needs support, not be smothered. \n\nI get that you want to be there for her and take care of her, but trust me, you're just going to make her want to run away from you as soon as she's able. \n\nThe decision for her to stay was the right one to make, but you went about the wrong way to make it.", "NTA. She is reacting to the new reality - and dealing with many limitations due to the meningitis. \n\nShe needs to be reminded that this is temporary and she can transfer and transition back to living on her own when she\u2019s fully recovered. Hearing this may also help keep her motivated and focused on doing everything she can to facilitate regaining as much independence as possible. \nYou are an amazing sister. I hope she gets better.", "I think this would be the response if her sister acted irresponsibly and had to learn a lesson about her behavior.  Her sister is seriously ill and needs to be cared for.  She is looking out for her.  Is she supposed to send her back to her apartment when she can\u2019t even take a shower by herself???  That would be so irresponsible.  \n\nI agree with another post that the sister is probably just upset with the situation.  It\u2019s hard when you\u2019ve gone from being independent to relying on another person for basic care.  She should probably start seeing a therapist to work through her feelings.  However, she can\u2019t expect you to eat the costs for her place because she\u2019s upset about where she\u2019s at in life.  The best thing for you to do is talk to her about some compromises so she knows that she has choices in what happens.  Maybe make shorter term goals than a year from now.  Get a month to month tenant and make a plan for her to go back to school.  She won\u2019t feel completely helpless by having a say in the decisions."]}
