So we all met there and  because his daughter Ivy (6f) just learned how to read, everybody was up for her to distribute gifts. It was cute and all until she got to my gifts for my mom. I didn't even think about it when I labeled them. I just wrote \"mum\" and was done with it. But she grabbed them and handed them to her mum (my aunt). I realized what was happening and mouthed at her its not for her but for my mum and handed it to her. Ivy got upset I took gifts from her mum and started to cry. I tried to explain her that Santa left those gifts at my household so they were for my mum and that he didn't expect there to be so many mommies. She looked a bit suspicious at me for a moment but quickly got over it and finished giving gifts. \n\nLater I went to kitchen and my uncle and his wife came to me and told me I was an ass because I knew they were coming and I could have labeled the gifts with my mum s name instead.

NTA!", "NTA.  Who knew that Ivy was going to read?  Uncle and aunt are TAH for accusations and name calling.", "Nta, how on earth will they handle a actual problem, if they react like this over something dumb.", "NTA. I just label my family members' gifts by what I call them, not by name. Mom, Dad, grandparents' grandparent names. I don't know anyone who would wrap a gift for their mum and write her actual name on it.\n\nKnowing that you guys were having a sort of merged family Christmas, the 6 year old should've been monitored a little more by the aunt. In any case, it seems like she accepted your explanation and all was well that ended well, so your uncle being mad makes no sense anyway.", "NTA it was a simple misunderstanding with a simple solution. She'd gotten over it and moved on, why can't they? Seems like they like to nitpick & cause unnecessary drama.", "NTA. \n\nI wouldn't have even thought of that. My kid knows that not all present come from Santa, as I also want him to learn that GIVING is important as well. So honestly, I'd just say that gift was from ME and not Santa. I didn't realize some families has 100% gifts from Santa?", "NTA. You wrote your \u201cmum\u201d \u2019s name that you call her by. You put the gifts under the tree at your house. It\u2019s logical. \n\nThey are AH\u2019s for expecting you to have thought about changing labels. They\u2019re far too entitled and inappropriate. You should not have to cater to your relatives and their lies about Santa. That\u2019s their choice to do Santa and they should be prepared to deal with the consequences of their actions.  Furthermore, they are the parents. They are the ones who need to think about those things and not you, a childless less person who is not responsible for your cousin.", "A) Your aunt needs to get a grip.\n\n2) If your aunt wants all *their* gifts to be \u201cfrom Santa\u201d, that\u2019s fine. But IMO, Santa should not necessarily or automatically be \u201cresponsible\u201d (or credited) for ALL gifts at a family gathering like this - if you went through the effort to buy your mother a gift, and you want it to be from you, it should be! \n\nand finally,\n\nD) you\u2019re NTA.", "This is an easy NTA. Unless you can see into the future and knew all these moving pieces would come together, how is it reasonable to blame you? No harm, no foul, and Ivy's parents needed to intervene themselves if they wanted it managed differently.", "NTA. I would guess this is also the first year Ivy could read independently enough to distribute gifts without being told who to give it to, so it's an honest mistake. I think you played it off beautifully with a great on-the-spot explanation. Now if you make the same mistake next year, that would be inconsiderate.", "Your aunt & uncle actually told you were ass because of that?  I can't imagine how they'd handle an actual problem.\n\nNTA  This is so not a big deal.", "NTA. I got when parents want to give to their kids all magic feelings of Xmas, but not everybody is responsible to make everything thinking about how kids will deal with it", "NTA kids get upset for anything and everything AND there is absolutely no way you could have guessed the kid would be distributing when you wrote the label.", "NTA. Hopefully, you won\u2019t have to share future Christmas visits with your uncle and his wife because they are both AHs.", "NTA. Your aunt and uncle missed a moment to teach their child that earth revolves around the sun l, not her, and that there is more than one mum in the world.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NTA here. You had short notice before coming and how were you supposed to read a child\u2019s mind and have the forethought to change the gift tags? If they were so worried and had thought about it beforehand they should\u2019ve warned you. It sucks that it confused her but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s by any means your fault.", "NTA, the others defo are", "NTA.  This confusion happens at my house and every house I know.  Always write who it's from, too.", "NTA. They\u2019re ridiculous.", "NTA. It was a simple mistake and you handled it perfectly well. The kid has probably already forgotten it. They're making a fuss out of nothing.", "NTA and very creative cover-up on your feet! I would\u2019ve been a stuttering mess haha.", "NTA. -  tell them to stuff it where the sun don\u2019t shine.  Tell them if they stuck to the normal schedule there wouldn\u2019t have been a problem and to kiss your red rosy ass.", "NTA. Your uncle and aunt are petty af. You accommodated them so they can come earlier than they normally do. \n\nThough I usually put recipient and giver on the card which might\u2019ve helped with the confusion. I don\u2019t think you should stop putting Mum on your cards, because that\u2019s who she is to you. It\u2019d be weirder to write her first name or \u201cAuntie So-and-so\u201d just for the benefit of your cousin. \n\nHopefully they just come on the 26th next year so you won\u2019t have to deal with them again. If they continue to make a big deal out of this\u2026 let the trash take itself out.", "NTA honest oversight", "NTA - You actually handled it REALLY well with Ivy. She wanted to help and didn\u2019t want to see her mom upset, so you explained it in terms she would understand. And as you said, once she realized that no one was getting shorted, she was fine.\n\nLmao at them being mad at you for her \u201casking questions about Santa.\u201d", "NTA. As others have said, Ivy needs to learn that other people have mums and gifts aren't all from Santa.", "NTA, most kids at that age know there are other \"mom's\", like their friends have a mom. Your explanation was perfect and this is not the hill they think it is.... Tell them to watch Frozen.... They can learn to let it go....let it go before you never get invited back for being arseholes (sung in the melody)...", "NTA. Ffs \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f everyone is supposed to walk on eggshells because \u201ctheir\u201d plans changed. Do you call your mum by her first name? No. Then why tf would you address her gifts as such?", "NTA, how absurd that you're being scapegoated because they can't be bothered to explain that other people call their mothers the same as she does!", "Uh, absolutely NTA. I always label my gifts for my mom with some form of \u201cmom\u201d, \u201cmama\u201d, \u201cmum\u201d etc. I\u2019ve never used her real name. \n\nYou\u2019re not going to rush to relabel every gift because a child is coming over", "NTA your uncle, sounds like the type of person that expects to be accommodated for everything. I will tell them to get a grip because that is your mom so you put it for your mother and you gave a pretty good explanation and they need to get over themselves she probably just wanted the present. And that\u2019s why she\u2019s upset.", "NTA\n\nWe were told as children that some gifts are from Santa and some gifts are from people. So there would have been nothing wrong with saying that this was a gift you'd gotten for your mum. Sometimes young children have a hard time grasping that Nana is their mommy's mommy and there's nothing wrong with reinforcing that relationship.", "NTA. I would feel really weird writing my parents' first names on presents.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

One of my nephews is 6 this Christmas, and wanted to hand out presents, whenever he wasn't sure which mum he asked an adult and we helped him.
