Her mother unfortunately passed away when she was only 1, rest her soul. Despite me raising her as my own for basically her entire life, I make sure to speak about her real mother often and we have a memorial set up for her right on our mantal. She was a phenomenal woman. \n\nNow since being with Ben I have had 2 children of my own. Both boys, aged 10 and 9. Our 9yo has some problems that we are all adjusting to (just diagnosed with ODD 2 years ago, as well as severe ADHD). But despite him having problems, I have noticed (we all have noticed, actually) that my step daughter has been acting out since the diagnosis. She will copy my son's actions and states she simply doesn't want to be \"left out\" and due to this, her maturity levels seem to be declining, not progressing. Her therapist has told us to simply be patient, and we have done our best to be accommodating. Now, my step daughter is brilliant. Incredibly talented (she plays several instruments) and wicked smart. She is currently on her 2nd year of high honors and has skipped ahead a grade as of this year. It's simply this... Need.. to be just like her brother that has been troublesome. And with that has come a lot of snarky remarks that get under our skin quite often. For instance, if her father and I mess up on ANYTHING she immediately makes comments of \"I could do that so much better. It's because you're simply not as good as me.\" And other things.. such as if her brother even so much as starts to become overwhelmed, she immediately feeds it with so much unnecessary fuel and eggs him on. Example: he will get made at his tablet (that he has for learning his math facts- ABC Mouse- because he is behind) and as soon as he gets mad, she makes comments telling him to shut up and this ticks him off and then she will accuse him of everything she possibly can (he threw something at her, despite him not doing that and us being right there as a witness). We have spoken to her several times about her constant lying and she just starts making it in to a joke. \n\nSo this afternoon she pulled the crap again and said our son threw a drum stick at her (he didn't, we were sitting right there and he was on the VR), so I immediately said \"Maybe you should join drama since you're so good at acting out made up scenarios\". She stomps off to her room and slams the door. Later telling her father that I have made her feel stupid when he went in to speak to her about her lying, again. Completely turned it on me and made out like I was the problem. I know this sounds stupid but I'm beyond overwhelmed with it at this point. My husband said I need to watch what I say, despite this being the first time I've spoken like this, because she is \"already dealing with so much\".

And you are obviously overwhelmed by all of this, which is understandable. \nNow you say it's been two years, have you discussed all of this with her therapist? Specially the lying, I mean she knows you know she is lying and still she tries to get her brother in trouble, patience doesn't seem to be enough anymore for her of for you, you and her need to figure it out what's going on with her and a better way to expressed it than provoking her brother.

I kind of wanted to cheer for you with that line, not gonna lie.

If she doesn't like it, she needs to fix her attitude.", "That comment was uncalled for in the context in which you said it.  When you have one child who has behavioral/special needs issues, the other children in the family often suffer.  Life seems to revolve around the one with the issues, and it's traumatic for the others.  It really sounds like your step daughter needs some intentional one on one attention.  To me, it seems like her behavior is a cry for her own attention.  She sees you and your husband tending to the child with behavioral issues, so she is likely mimicking that behavior so she gets some attention as well.  And as for you, momma, hang in there!  Parenting these types of issues is incredibly difficult and intense.  I hope you have some outside support for yourself, and chances to get your own respite.  You will parent better if you get a break, too.", "NTA, she is 14 already and should be mature enough to not be doing that kind of things, if she was 10 things would be diferent\n\n\nBut just to make sure, she isnt diagnosed with anything right?", "NTA - She sounds like a wounded, yet coddled, teenager.

With the relatively new diagnosis of your son, is she feeling left out? I do think you should apologize to her, but as a conversation starter as to how her actions make you feel.  Keep talking with her therapist.", "YTA You are the ADULT here! first, I\u2019d like to point out how you frequently call her your \u201cstep daughter\u201d.

You do have a sin with some special needs here but you also need some perspective. If he has a meltdown everything stops and you protect his needs, if she has a meltdown, you get mad at her and expect her to know better. She\u2019s still a kid too. Her maturity is going backwards because she sees your son getting his needs met and her needs are NOT getting met!\n\nI work in education. ODD is serious. It takes a toll on the whole family and it is taking a toll on your daughter. Do not expect her to be an adult who should be taking care of your son. That\u2019s not her job.", "YTA. You're the parent, act like it. This was a childish way to handle poor behavior.", "I think maybe you need to focus on the fact that your step daughter is seeing you validate constantly her brother, but not her.

She has halfbrothers .... with issues - that likely have been presenting themselves for most of his life - meaning that Hannah (who seems to be remarkable) has been \"forgotten\" for quite a few years while the struggles of brother have been the most important. \n\nShe's 13 so newly hormonal and is probably sick of what's going on with her brother so is emulating because she doesn't know how to say, *\"I miss my mom, I'm annoyed with my brother, and I want some attention for how awesome I am\"* so instead she acts like *that* ... \n\nI don't even think you, necessarily, suck for this situation - or any of it really - it all just sucks.

Sarcasm **does not work as a parenting technique** when kids are mad and upset. I understand why you said it, but it doesn\u2019t work.

An illness or disability affects the whole family, changes dynamics and can lead to lifelong grudges and hurts. Therapy for just one child means expectations are on that child to change/ cope/learn. The whole family needs to adapt, your behaviour, husbands and siblings. Family therapy is different from couples, or just attending another child\u2019s occasional session. Please consider this. It is a common refrain of families and adult children to go NC in adulthood through unresolved pain in dealing with these issues. I wish you luck and empathy. I would also encourage you to seek out a parents group of ODD for added support and wisdom. And/or a Parents as Carers group too.", "Maybe praise any of her helpful attempts around home, or with her brother. When we are stressed and trying to cope,  our tolerance for annoying behaviour from others is way shorter. Don\u2019t keep your struggles from her. Ask her for ideas, input, thoughts. If you problem solve as a family, she has more skin in the game, so to speak. Ask her how she would handle something. You don\u2019t need to follow a child\u2019s advice, but rather than place her in the problem category, give her the opportunity to step up. Siblings often have something helpful to add.", "Lying is awful, and dangerous if it goes on. It can be a hard habit to deal with.   \nSo, why the lying? What\u2019s the motivation? It can be helpful to come at from that point of view.", "Consistent. consequences for kids with ODD are very important. I\u2019m sure the child\u2019s therapist is working with the family on what those are, but yes it is important that he consistently has certain things happen when he has inappropriate behavior too. That\u2019s how he learns. ODD is very serious and it can potentially lead to even more severe problems but hopefully coping skills are learned that prevent that.", "My stepson had ODD and holy hell, it was exhausting. He's now a productive member of society, but we weren't always sure it was going to happen.", "I didn't really mean they don't get consequences. I meant that the usual consequences one would use don't work. Grounding, taking things away, chores, etc. They need different kinds of punishment.", "Who says \u201cI\u2019ve been patient \u201cas a response to justify why it\u2019s ok to not follow the therapist advice to be patient, now?", "Wonderful news for your family! My nephew too as well as a couple students. My nephew got worse before he got better. It\u2019s really tough or I should say it can be but also he lacked structure at home :(", "Taking things away can be. And exercise is key for these kids. Of course it\u2019s good for everyone but he will need it even more.", "People who find patience isn't working.", "Yeah, but taking things away can be quite complicated. You can't allow any room for them to make a choice or find a loophole.", "Correct it has to be consistent. If you throw your  tablet, it gets taken away for 1 hour. Then that has to happen and a visual timer is set that the kid can watch as it counts down (there are special timers that change colors as they count down so a child can visually see the time pass) \n\nAnd it must happen every time and the child will absolutely have fits sometimes, sometimes even big fits. Some kids (I\u2019m not saying this child) may tear things off if walls, throw things in the house, take off running, etc. it can be a lot.", "NAH. Perhaps some therapy for your step-daughter? She probably feels replaced, that you love your two biological sons more, and the one having probably greater needs due to medical issues probably means she gets even less time/attention, so she is jealous and acting out?", "Yeah she is a kid obviously she wants attention and she she should get it. Not that the kid isnt in the wrong to act like this but wanting attention is nothing bad.", "LOL I was thinking the same thing! I was thinking would be so AH-ly about this? \ud83d\ude02", "As re you really fr comparing ADHD with someone bullying their kid brother?", "The son has ADHD and ODD if that\u2019s what you mean. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what you mean", "NAH. Parenting is hard, and she\u2019s getting up towards the pre-teen/teen stage where a lot of kids start pushing boundaries. I think this is normal tween angst maybe paired with a little bit of jealousy of her perception that her brother is getting more or special attention. My son also struggled in some of these areas, and his sister struggled with feeling like the energy I put towards working with his challenges meant that I favored him.. it can be an unfortunate vicious cycle.", "NTA. Also, her therapist sucks. A therapist shouldn\u2019t be telling you to be patient, that\u2019s allowing and entitling the behaviour. A hood therapist would be giving you behaviour management strategies.", "NAH. It's a difficult situation but she is old enough to have a serious conversation and maybe ask the quoted therapist for further insight on how to approach this, if you really are at a loss.", "NTA", "Daughter is a lying drama queen. She needs to snap out of it or she'll become an adult who acts that way. NTA.", "Unless you\u2019re straight up lying to your parents to get your brother (with a disorder) in trouble to get herself attention. She can want attention, sure, but going to that extent to get it IS wrong.", "yes, thats what they mean. are you seriously comparing someone bullying a disabled child to said disabled child\u2019s legitimate medical conditions? really?"]}
