A car broke down, she made it home, it was a matter of a singe phone call to a mechanic and a bit of a delay in her plans (in the comfort of her own home). To claim this under some special family needs is just assholery. It's like asking someone to stay and watch while the other does the dishes. \"You can't have fun because my own plans fell through\". That's extremely toxic and that's what it reads like based on your side of the story.\n\nOn the other hand (would be much better if she could actually articulate it) people have anxieties about certain situations.

My wife goes to an art class on Wednesday nights and does a dog training class on Sunday afternoon. She has also started running every morning as she was really upset about her weight after the baby came. I am happy to look after the baby when these happen and I like that she has some things to make her feel human and keep her mental health afloat.\n\nI don't have any regular weekly things and have agreed to do all my workouts outside of family time (work lunchtimes etc). I play soccer ad-hoc, probably once every 3 weeks or so, and generally have the baby another time to make up for it. So long as I get to do my workouts (in my own time) I am happy. This occasionally gets disrupted when the baby is sick and can't go to childcare - we usually assess who has an easier work schedule that week do decide who takes PTO.\n\nI felt I had a good chance of making this team, but needed to be at the trial.\n\nMy wife tends to believe she does more heavy lifting in terms of child organisation ie organising clothes, planning baby's activities, buying things etc. I believe I do most/all of the cooking, bins, physical stuff. I prefer this as I am terrible at the organisation stuff - my wife hates bins and by her own admission isn't a good cook. We could potentially change this distribution, haven't really discussed.\n\nThere have been other events that I've had to cancel last minute - I'll usually say 'are you sure you need me to stay' which tends to annoy her as she thinks it's always obvious. Most of those are kind of fair, such as when the baby has gotten sick and might need further potentially urgent care. They also haven't been that important to me in the scale of things.

It\u2019s a pretty simple process.\n\nHas she never done this before? Was she raised with strict gender roles?

I'm completely gullible in that way. He ends up actually being able to do more things unbothered because I am not feeling stressed. \n\nDon't let her mood stop you from doing something you planned for.

Women alone are often targets of violence. Having a baby with her pro ably also made her feel more vulnerable. Maybe OP regularly ditches the family to meet his own happiness?

How many hours a week would he devote to soccer if he got on the team?  Would she get an equal amount of free time away from the baby?

I see the same level of support in you (some of my pick up group played in the winter, but I would stop at the point fingers too cold to grip disk).

I don't understand this: \"She said I should be putting my family's needs first and considering how much stress this was causing her I should stay.\" She was at home; you already called the mechanic and had him coming so she did not need to arrange for that.
