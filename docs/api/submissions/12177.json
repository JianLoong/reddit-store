That was brushed off.\n\nThe reason I know why Carol is okay with this? She was the exact same way as a kid and our parents went along with. She always got gifts on my birthday. I would on hers too, but I just found the whole thing obnoxious. Why not just teach her that not everything is about her?\n\nI had already bought Jesse\u2019s gift and decided not to get one for Dawn. The party was as fun as a kid\u2019s party can be, haha. Then presents came. Dawn and Jesse sat side by side. Carol handed out each gift. One other person had the same idea as me and only got Jesse a gift. You could tell that upset Dawn. \n\nThen they got to mine. Jesse was thrilled to open his gift. Dawn teared up and stomped off, refusing to come back outside or open more gifts.

If there was a justified asshole category I would give that to you but alas.", "NTA\n\nBut... hmm...\n\nIn my household we tend to look at objectives and lessons.\n\nYou had, if I'm reading this correctly, 3 main objectives:\n\n1) Not purchasing a second child's gift for a single child's party.\n\n2) Teach Dawn that she cannot always be the center focus.\n\n3) Ensure that Jesse got the attention/love on his bday.\n\n(Feel free to let me know if I got it wrong, and I'll gladly re-evaluate)\n\nTo achieve objective 1, you had 2 options: Ignore the instructions and bring a single gift. Or follow the instructions and bring no gift.\n\nYou chose the first option, in order to accomplish objectives 2 and 3.\n\nThe facts of what happened were this:\n\nJesse and Dawn were both put in a position of center focus. \n\nBoth children were opening gifts. \n\nTwo people chose not to bring a gift for Dawn\n\nDawn cried, stomped off, refused to come outside.\n\nYour sister called you an asshole.\n\nWere the objectives achieved?\n\nDuring the first part of the gift-opening, both Jesse and Dawn were the center of attention. Both Jesse and Dawn were enjoying the attention and love.\n\nWhen Dawn did not get a gift, she started to cry and stomp off, making Dawn the center of attention.\n\nYou say she refused to come back outside, so I'm assuming her mother went in to attempt to bring her back out at some point. \n\nThis means that on Jesse's birthday, during Jesse's gift-opening, Dawn was getting the love and attention of Jesse's mom.\n\nThen she called you an asshole. If that was done in hearing of other guests, that brings the center of focus onto you.\n\nHonestly? I don't think objective 3 was achieved here *unless* this permanently changes your sister's approach to this.\n\nWas objective 2 achieved? Well... I doubt it. Because whether this achieved your goal or not is entirely dependent on what Carol tells her children about what happened.\n\nIF Carol explains to Dawn that you did not get her a gift because most families only give gifts to the birthday child, and that she won't always get gifts on Jesse's birthday... *and* this lesson is repeated (because a 6 year old rarely retains a lesson for long if it's not repeated), then yes, objective achieved. Dawn learns that the world doesn't revolve around her.\n\nIF, on the other hand, Carol tells her daughter that she doesn't *know* why you excluded her. That auntie was very mean. That some people are just selfish. \n\nWell... Dawn just learned that you don't love her. That you like Jesse better. That you're mean and selfish.\n\nAnd none of that is *true*. But it's how the situation will read to Dawn, if Carol spins it that way.\n\nAs for Jesse? He's 4. He will not remember this at all.\n\nI get what you were going for, and you're not the AH for the choice you made. I just don't think you *accomplished* anything positive. \n\nYour niece was sad during the party. Your nephew lost a bit of attention. Your sister is upset with you. Your family is choosing sides. There was a bit of confusion and gossip... and Carol is still going to parent the way Carol parents.\n\nAnd you might not be invited to future bday parties. \n\nI'm trying to think how I would have handled this, and honestly IDK. Some families do give smaller sibling gifts. I don't agree with it in principle, but some families work that way, and they have a right to choose differently. Not every child feels the way you did about it.\n\nCarol allows it to continue because Carol *likes* the system you had as children.\n\nSo I might have done exactly what she requested. I'd have brought a gift for Jesse, and a (much smaller) gift for Dawn. And I would have done the same thing at Dawn's next party, in reverse.\n\nOr... if I felt as strongly as you do about it, I would have arrived without a gift. At some point during the party I would have talked to Jesse and said \"Hey kiddo, your gift wasn't ready yet, but it's coming soon!\" and then given it to him at another time. And I would have done the same thing at Dawn's next party, in reverse.\n\nBecause as much as I'd want to *change* this situation... I can't, so I'd only be punishing Dawn for something she currently isn't in control of. She's not throwing a fit because she got no gifts on her brother's birthday. She's throwing a fit because instead of teaching her how birthday gifts work, her mother told her that *they* would be opening gifts. That she *should* expect gifts.  It's a situation her mother is orchestrating. She made *both* children the center of attention, after all.\n\nMy issue wouldn't have been with Dawn, but with Carol.\n\n... kind of all moot, though, I suppose, since it's already happened. \n\nAnyway, NTA but maybe not the best way to handle it?", "Yes, I'm afraid YTA in this situation. It's understandable that you want to teach your niece about sharing and not always getting what she wants, but the way you went about it was not appropriate. Your sister clearly expressed her concerns about Dawn's behavior at parties and how she didn't want her to ruin Jesse's party. You could have respected her wishes and bought a small, inexpensive gift for Dawn to show that you care about her too. Instead, you deliberately chose not to get her anything, which only made her feel left out and upset.\n\nFurthermore, it's not your place to teach your niece a \"harsh lesson\" at someone else's party. That's not fair to Jesse, who deserves to have a fun and happy birthday celebration without any drama or hurt feelings. Your actions have caused unnecessary tension and division within your family, and I would suggest apologizing to your sister and niece for your behavior.", "ESH. You are 100% correct here. Your sister isn't being a good parent and teaching appropriate lessons. But it's not your job to parent in her place, and you were given clear instructions to either bring a gift for both or none at all. If that's the way she chooses to raise her kids, that's her choice.", "YTA. I don\u2019t agree with their parenting choice either, but they\u2019re not my damn kids, are they? You were given clear instructions on the invite\u2014 either bring no gift or two gifts. It\u2019s not your job to teach someone else\u2019s kids lessons and it\u2019s obnoxious as hell.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your party and they\u2019re not your kids. You don\u2019t like how they\u2019re being parented and unwilling to adhere to the request?

My brother and I enjoy this tradition, so even in adulthood, I get him a gift on my birthday and he gets me one on his. Easy enough since we are a smaller family.", "Nta. So many parents enable bad behaviour because they can't stand upsetting their children. What they don't realise is that life is upsetting, and by not teaching these kids how to handle disappointment or being upset they raise monsters that no one wants to associate with.", "NTA.   Parents who allow their children to persist in this behavior are setting themselves up for some very resentful (and some very spoiled) children.  The sooner your niece realizes that everything is not about her, the less likely she is to win Bridezilla of the Decade when she gets married.  Not to mention the problems Dawn is going to have when she starts working and doesn't get all the same promotions her fellow employees get.  Just because your parents allowed your sister to get away with this behavior does not make it right.", "On my birthday several family members arrived with gifts for my then 2 year old daughter. I immediately made it clear that I was not ok with it (after the part, no drama), because it will regularly happen that someone else receives a gift and she does not and I want to teach her this at a young age.", "No, but you can decide not to randomly spend your hard earned money for someone else's kid for no fucking reason.", "So an uncle can only buy his nephew a present IF the niece gets one too?", "Stupid expectation, stupid rule. All she\u2019s doing is perpetuating that her daughters tantrums are more important than her sons birthday. But you do you."]}
