Get off Reddit and relearn how to be a functional human being, please.", "NTA, you didn't steal the hat, you retrieved it. If this situation is frequent with your nephew, it might be worth installing cameras to prevent future thefts and provide evidence to his parents about their son's behavior.\n\nAlthough I believe it's the right thing to tell the parents, I'm afraid it's too late now.

Yes, stealing this cap itself is a show of bad behaviour, but it can be a one-off incident and can be healthily addressed as a teachable moment for your nephew. I think for young kids, a phase of mild kleptomania needs to be handled calmly instead of with brute force. YTA because you did not behave as a mature adult either. Stealing it back is almost childish behaviour, especially when you hadn\u2019t tried any other option yet. Definitely an understanding adult needs to talk to your neohew about this, so please do inform his parents. Now in your case you already have the cap back in your possession so you need not worry about the \u201cmy kid wouldn\u2019t yadayadayada\u201d.
