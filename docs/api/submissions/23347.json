I gave her my stepdad's Mike 55m surname. My mom divorced my dad when I was 5 and introduced me to Mike when I was 7. My dad remarried and had other kids and didn't try and reconnect with me until I was 12. I had no interest in talking to him, and ignored him. However, Mike encouraged me to at least hear him out and I started talking to my dad again.\n\nWhen I was 16, my mom told me she and my dad were having an affair. Mike broke up with my mom, but my dad and his wife stayed together. I had to stay with my mom, and although Mike had tried to fight for custody ad I had asked the court to stay with him, but as my mom was my bio parent and not declared unfit, I had to stay with her. Since my parents divorce, I have had my mom's surname. She is a good parent, but we have had a strained relationship since her affair althoguth we are much closer now and she was a massive help when I was pregnant, and I have not spoken to my dad since. Me and Mike are still close- he was there at both my graduations and helped make Amy's nursery\n\nWhen my daughter was born, I decided to give her Mike's surname and announced her name and a hospital photo on my social media. My mom saw the post she called me. She admitted she had made a few mistakes and said despite that she was there for me, which I agree with, but I wanted to give Amy Mike's surname. She is very upset, and some of my mom's family have called me to say I should have given Amy my surname like my mom wants, especially as it will be a massive pain to explain why I have a different surname to my daughter and we will struggle later in life.", "created_utc": 1690554104, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15byur6/aita_for_giving_my_daughter_my_stepdads_surname/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So, for instance, if Mike actually is his real name and not a pseudonym, you could have given her the middle name \"Michaela.\" That way you could have Mike involved in her name still while not having to deal with your daughter having a different last name than you, which may be annoying to deal with at times.\n\nHowever, I don't think it makes you an asshole at all. I think your mom is just upset that it is now a reminder of her being shitty to Mike, and your family is just siding with her because family. I don't know what your relationship situation is, obviously, but let's say you got married to a guy and took his last name and had a kid together. The kid would have a different last name than your mom then, and none of them would be upset about it. It isn't because the last names are different. It is specifically because they don't want it to be Mike's last name.", "NTA\n\nYout baby not hers. Case closed", "NTA,\nI think its a beautiful gesture to both your stepdad and daughter. It takes a village and he is part of it.", "NTA. Mike is more your father than your bio dad is. Of all the people you have described, he sounds like the only one who has been there for you consistently and has not done anything wrong. Honoring him by giving your daughter his name is great thing to do. I imagine he was thrilled by it. You have the right to make the decision you made, and I don't see anything wrong with it. The issue of explaining her name to people is ridiculous. Lots of people have different names from parents because so many people are divorced and remarried.", "NTA, is it unusual, yes.

There was bound to be fallout. Now it's just dealing with the results of your decision. AH? No.", "NTA,  you honoured the true dad in your life.", "I used to nanny and many of the kids in the neighborhood had 2 working professional parents.  It was very common for the moms to have kept maiden names and the kids had moms name as a middle and dads for a last name.  Not all parents want to hyphenate and give their kids ridiculously long names.\n\nMost people if they don't know your particular story will probably just assume Amy has dads last name.  And the truth isn't any ones business unless you want to tell them.

As presumably you could have used his surname just as much as your stepdad's.

She was the one who raised me, not my father. Why must I bear my father's surname? If I changed it today, he would feel bad by it, which I don't want either. Let your daughter be connected to you. Your personal problems with your mother and your connection with your stepfather are not your daughter's history.
