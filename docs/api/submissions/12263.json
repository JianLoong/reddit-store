Mom told her she found it so strange for a grown adult, especially a man, to have a cutesy name like that and nothing else to fall back on. I tried to cut in but mom insisted it was a valid question, dad backed her up saying it was strange and surely there was a more grown name they could have given them.

They were incredibly rude to ask this question.  I can\u2019t imagine a circumstance where it would be acceptable to ask the question at all, certainly not using the language you have relayed the question to us in.", "NTA that was really rude to both your in laws and your fiance. How did your fiance take it?", "NTA. If they were just curious about the name, then they could\u2019ve asked it more politely. \u201cAlbie is an interesting name? What made you choose that? \u201c. They put judgment in their question and looked down their nose at your future in-laws. They were rude.", "Whoa. That was aome serious judgment about your future husband's name. If they had stopped at asking how did you pick the name and maybe said they hadn't heard of it before that would be ok. You were right to call them out and tell them to stop. The fact that they didn't the first time you asked them to is just odd.  It's crazy they chose to double down. \n\nYou aren't a kid, you are an adult.

Based on the information, it was a very rude question and she was being very rude in this situation. That your father also backed her up, indicating that this behavior was not an one-off occurrence, is worrying.\n\nI would advise to have a conversation with your parents about their behavior at the dinner and how it was inappropriate and disrespectful they were. It's important to set boundaries and let them know that this type of behavior will not be tolerated in the future. It may also be helpful to ask them to apologize to the future in-laws if they haven't done so already.\n\nCommunication is key in any relationship, and it's important to be honest and clear about your expectations and boundaries.", "NTA your parents seems to be missing out on some of the essential filters in public.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So yea, obviously they were assholes. But to debate how they were actually being assholes in front of the inlaws? You just stooped down to their level at that point. Should've just let them make a fool of themselves and be the better person. And then admit to your fiance how embarrassing it was. Welcome to the club.", "NTA - you 2 must be a cool couple though, you have each other's back and that will take you a long way. Your parents probably don't like the power shift away from them and are trying to undermine it ( I may be being cynical here, I've experienced this with my in-laws and my wife gave the attempts absolutely no traction at all). Keep up the good work!", "NTA", "NTA  Next time be prepared with a couple of people who are also named Albie, such as Albie Manzo (Google him). Also tell them that a name doesn't make a person it's only an identifier and you think his parents did a wonderful job shaping him into the person he is.", "NTA. The question was rude (honestly, even if they'd known your ILs for a long time it would be rude). When normal people realize they've said something rude, they back off. But instead, your parents decided to double down and get loud about their right ask rude questions.\n\nThey were totally out of line and you were right to put them in check.", "NTA. They knew what they were doing.", "Your parents were trying to establish dominance; you shut it down. Well done you!  \n\nNTA despite what they say; they are butt hurt they were thwarted.", "NTA - your parents have no filter. You did right.", "NTA. Your parents however are AHs. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA Your parents were acting like rude children and you called them out on that. In addition to that they insulted your future husband over his name. The only ones who have a problem with that name is your parents. They need to learn their manners. All you did was try to defend your future in-laws. Kiddos to them for not holding it against you and you're still good.", "NTA -  they were rude. You called them out on it.", "NTA and really, good job in standing up for your in laws. There are so many stories on here of people letting their parents just run riot and then expecting their SO to deal with it, it is refreshing to get a AITA post where that is not the case. I'm sure both your partner and future ILs really appreciated it.", "NTA. Your parents went above rude, it's almost like they were trying to shame them for choosing a name they liked for their own son. Id probably reconsider inviting them to the wedding.", "NTA\n\nThat was horrendously rude! \n\nThey basically said what were you thinking naming your child that, it's weird and stupid. He should have a grown up name.\nThey just dressed it up pretty as a curious question.", "I think it\u2019s a toss up who was worse here, you or your parents. They were rude, but if you had stayed out of it, the conversation would have been over in 2 or 3 sentences. Instead you got involved & fought with your parents to the point that other people in the restaurant noticed. I imagine watching the 3 of you fight was just as awkward for your in-laws as the original question. NTA but it\u2019s a close call with E S H.", "Your parents seem to lack a filter, AND don't want anyone *calling them out* when they ask (rude) questions.\n\nThis is how they are, how they've always been, and probably how others in their family act; they don't see anything wrong with it. That does not make it OK.\n\nIt may not do any good, but when things calm down, I'd have the \"*It's not* what *you asked  as it is the* way *you asked\"* talk. It probably won't change their way of asking, but maybe it will decrease the number of rude questions!!", "NTA and FWIW when my sister got married her husband on being introduced to my father (named Albert) started immediately calling him Bertie. This was meant to be a funny/loving reference to PG Wodehouse's 'Jeeves' series. My parents were taken aback and didnt think it was funny (we arent British and BIL is), whats more my dad had a poor time at school being called a close diminutive to Bertie. Anyway after a pair of days where they realised that future SIL was going to keep calling him Bertie, they asked him to stop. This caused a massive scene where future SIL got very defensive and then walked off with my sister being left in the middle not daring to contradict her future husband. \n\nThings then got even more awkward when future SIL had to raise the fact he had expected my parents to pay for the wedding as that was normal in the UK (or so he claimed), whereas where we are from its sort of 50/50 between in-laws. When my Dad objected there was another 'Well you are indeed not Bertie because he would have paid for it.' that didnt help matters. Worse when my Dad reluctantly agreed he was incensed to find future SIL had suddenly added 150 guests to the list for reception and dinner.\n\nThe one exchange about my Dad's name complicated - quite literally - the relationship of my parents with my sister and BIL for a decade or more. The other issues - had they been discussed outside of the rude opening regarding my Dad's first name - could have been resolved more amicably. My BIL may come over as a bit uncouth in the above but in fact he is a lovely guy and was just caught on the wrong side of a cultural misunderstanding. They have been married near 50 years and had a great relationship subsequently until my Dad passed away. Its just sad to think how many good years were lost due to a remark that came off badly.", "NTA\nWas this \"concern\" about your husband's name new? Had your parents ever mentioned it before? It seems like an odd thing for them to criticize at all, let alone to his parents.\n\nI wonder if your parents have other concerns they won't say, because they'd expose a cultural or racial bias, so they distilled that \"concern\" into second guessing a decision made decades ago.", "They answered with they loved the name. But didn't engage in the whole the name isn't good for an adult thing.", "Right? Like if you like the name but never heard it before, cool, ask nicely. But to pose it as you did it wrong, why? kinda way is just so rude.", "He thanked me for stepping in. He found my parents ridiculous for bringing it up.", "No, there were other discussions going on when my mom brought it up. She actually cut through something else to bring up that particular topic and she said it with judgement vs curiosity.", "Agreed. This is where the art of the conversation change comes in: \"My Albie is as unique as his name, that why I love him! Know what else I love? This salad dressing - it's so...\" insert long inane description of the attributes of your dressing, then ask how someone else's meal is. It's usually best to leave the admonishment until after the party when you're alone. So, I'll say ESH, but parents were rude indeed.", "Yes! The way they were asking about the name was rude, but you trying to shut them down like that was what caused the scene in the end. Did your future ILs even get a chance to respond, OP? Do you know this is a sore subject? Why did you butt in like that?", "You've got good in-laws there! These relationships are tricky, best of luck moving forward. Enjoy your wedding :) \n\nDefinatly NTA.", "Have they brought it up to him before because  that is also rude", "Okay, you know your mum best\n\nI know I whispered \u2018WTF\u2019 to myself many times with my parents meeting my in laws, in reflection and through conversation they felt awkward and there it went", "I think it was right to shut them down - it showed that OP would be respectful to their fiance and their IL's and not let their own parents get away with being rude and antagonistic. NTA.", "Respectfully disagree. I don't think you read or interpreted exactly how far OP argued with his folks. Making a couple attempts to stop them was appropriate. To openly argue about it was only embarrassing to OP because he partook in the argument.", "NTA. They were being rude. And weird. Who would ask something like that?", "NTA I don't care how long you've known someone it's rude to disparage the name they chose for their child. It would be different if they asked how you came up with the name but they straight up insulted their choice.\n\nI hope you and your husband name all of your kids cutesy names. I hope you have some Billy's, Susie's, maybe a Bitsy thrown in there.", "NTA. If they were really curious, they could have asked if it was short for anything. If your ILs said no, your parents should have dropped it. My husband\u2019s name is like a shortened version of a formal name, and people ask questions about it all the time. Some people are nice, some are rude. Curiosity is fine, but judging and harassing are not. Your parents lack tact.", "What a f\u2019ed up way to start a marriage. The future does not look too promising with the IL\u2019s around. I hope they move somewhere far away from her parents.", "NTA, they can name their son as they see fit. There\u2019s nothing wrong with his name. Your parents are way out of line, especially in public. I commend you for standing up for your fianc\u00e9.", "NTA", "They never brought it up to me if they had these concerns. The only thing that comes to mind is when I first told them about him, they asked what Albie was short for and that was it.", "NTA \n\nDid they grow up in a cave? That is incredibly rude!! Maybe if it's a close friend I could understand asking something about that, albeit with better phrasing, but that was a mess.", "Even if I happened to agree with your parents about the name I would never say it. Very rude. Good on you for sticking up for your fianc\u00e9 and in laws. NTA.", "Mostly NTA. Your parents seem like they lack social filters and don\u2019t know how to be gracious and reserved in public. The seem to think that among \u201cfriends\u201d they can be loud and turn off their social filters. But you seem to have inherited this trait as well by escalating a dispute in front of your inlaws instead of graciously redirecting your parents to another topic", "NTA. Your parents sounded rude. I forsee future name conflicts in your future with them if you decide to have children", "NTA your parents are rude, entitled and intrusive. His parents love his name, he loves his name and you love his name they need to get over it. I have cousins named for the seasons, cute artsy names huh. All very successful, all very confident people, all very adult people with their own homes and everything. You are nicer than I am because sarcasm is my jam and I would have told them to knock it off because I love the way his name sounds when I scream it but I am a petty bitch so yeahhhh.", "NTA.  Your parents were bullying your future in-laws.  It\u2019s notable that your in-laws and fianc\u00e9 are appreciative of your efforts to call out the inappropriate behavior and the people who are miffed are the offenders.\n\nDo not apologize.  They just learned a powerful lesson and will hopefully think twice before they do this again.", "You were NTA. Your parents were rude and presumptuous. Why couldn't they have asked you or your fiance about the origin of your fiance's name? That they asked your future ILs in such a manner tells me that they have issues with his name.", "NTA - your parents were very rude and out of line. Insulting your future ILs is not a good a look. Also, what the hell does it matter?", "Hey I just met you, \n\nAnd this is Craaaazy,\n\nWhy are you named,\n\nlike a baby? \n\nNTA and your parents are completely oblivious to their actions. It sounds like your future inlaws are cool though."]}
