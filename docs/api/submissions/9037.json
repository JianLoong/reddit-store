I do not share this with my husband. I don't tell him when I buy candy for it. I don't tell him where I put it. If he finds my secret candy stash (and he knows it exists and goes looking sometimes), I find a new place for it. If he asks me what I have in my candy stash or if I bought something on a recent grocery store trip, I do not tell him.\n\nThis really bothers my husband that I basically am keeping secret treats from him that he can't have, when we share everything else and have shared finances. It's the principle of the matter for him. He doesn't like that I'm willing to be secretive about something, and also that there is something I am not willing to share. I am presently unrepentant though (but willing to hear if I'm the AH, thus the question). I like having a treat that is just mine, that I can have at any point and know exactly how much is left. No looking forward to a treat, only to discover the last of it has already been finished. To be honest, I do like the secrecy of it too and think this is a pretty innocent way of having a secret. I totally do get joy out of quickly sneaking some candy when my husband is out of the house or busy elsewhere in the house.\n\nA few more relevant details:\n\n\\- We have shared finances but money isn't an issue. It's probably one small bag of candy ($3) every 1-2 weeks. I don't drink coffee/get Starbucks, so I feel that's a pretty cheap weekly treat.\n\n\\- I do 70% of the grocery shopping but my husband still goes grocery shopping. I have told him he is welcome to keep his own secret candy stash, and I'm happy to even buy candy for it on one of my trips. He isn't interested. I also do buy shared treats such as ice cream or even candy when I go grocery shopping that gets put in the regular pantry.\n\n\\- I'll admit that my husband is better at sharing than I am, especially food. I grew up with tons of siblings where you kinda had to fight and hold your own in order to get enough. Keeping a candy stash probably does come from a place of not wanting to share. I'm very prone to making/preparing food and treats FOR my husband, but if I'm already eating something, I'm not too excited about giving him a bite because I have exactly how much I'd like to eat. On the other hand, he is much more willing to offer or share a bite of something he is eating.\n\nSo, am I the AH?

Especially after your comments about growing up in a house where you had to compete for treats. It seems like you're holding some (very minor) trauma that I've seen before regarding having to hoard things that are special to you, and you're justifying it to yourself as a fun game, but girl . . . that NEED to \"keep a secret\" from your husband does not lead to good places. Not even over something as silly as candy, because it's the need to \"have a secret\" that's super unhealthy. Also, why do you need to \"sneak\" candy at all \"while your husband is busy\"? You're a grownup. Why would your husband even CARE if you have some candy. Honey...these are things you need to unpack with a therapist. Your husband isn't your parent. You don't need to hide things from him. You shouldn't WANT to hide things from him, or feel like you're being naughty if you do something completely normal like have some candy.", "Pretty minor, but YTA. \n\nIt just seems weird that you have this super weird desire to hide this and have this secret from your husband.  Its both harmless, and it says something about how you see him as well.  Like you guys aren't really a team, more 2 individuals.  Or at least, you want there to be an I in your team, where you can share stuff, but also have your own thing.", "ESH. I actually have a secret candy stash as well so it's a touch hypocritical for me to criticize you but your reasons are strange. I hide mine bc my husband will eat it all up in a day or 2 whereas I eat just a small amount and it lasts for a month. I can't stand going to get a treat and finding it all gone again.", "ESH. You for actually buying and hiding something from your husband (that he looks for) and him for not being responsible enough to share appropriately or get his own. But as a married man the idea that something is literally only for one person and the other person can never touch it just seems wrong to me. But he needs to know that he can't just eat it all either. Sharing is part of adult hood. My wife always steals some of my drinks.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
