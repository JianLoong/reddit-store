I do not share this with my husband. I don't tell him when I buy candy for it. I don't tell him where I put it. If he finds my secret candy stash (and he knows it exists and goes looking sometimes), I find a new place for it. If he asks me what I have in my candy stash or if I bought something on a recent grocery store trip, I do not tell him.\n\nThis really bothers my husband that I basically am keeping secret treats from him that he can't have, when we share everything else and have shared finances. It's the principle of the matter for him. He doesn't like that I'm willing to be secretive about something, and also that there is something I am not willing to share. I am presently unrepentant though (but willing to hear if I'm the AH, thus the question). I like having a treat that is just mine, that I can have at any point and know exactly how much is left. No looking forward to a treat, only to discover the last of it has already been finished. To be honest, I do like the secrecy of it too and think this is a pretty innocent way of having a secret. I totally do get joy out of quickly sneaking some candy when my husband is out of the house or busy elsewhere in the house.\n\nA few more relevant details:\n\n\\- We have shared finances but money isn't an issue. It's probably one small bag of candy ($3) every 1-2 weeks. I don't drink coffee/get Starbucks, so I feel that's a pretty cheap weekly treat.\n\n\\- I do 70% of the grocery shopping but my husband still goes grocery shopping. I have told him he is welcome to keep his own secret candy stash, and I'm happy to even buy candy for it on one of my trips. He isn't interested. I also do buy shared treats such as ice cream or even candy when I go grocery shopping that gets put in the regular pantry.\n\n\\- I'll admit that my husband is better at sharing than I am, especially food.

Not even over something as silly as candy, because it's the need to \"have a secret\" that's super unhealthy. Also, why do you need to \"sneak\" candy at all \"while your husband is busy\"? You're a grownup. Why would your husband even CARE if you have some candy. Honey...these are things you need to unpack with a therapist. Your husband isn't your parent. You don't need to hide things from him. You shouldn't WANT to hide things from him, or feel like you're being naughty if you do something completely normal like have some candy.", "Pretty minor, but YTA. \n\nIt just seems weird that you have this super weird desire to hide this and have this secret from your husband.

I actually have a secret candy stash as well so it's a touch hypocritical for me to criticize you but your reasons are strange.

You for actually buying and hiding something from your husband (that he looks for) and him for not being responsible enough to share appropriately or get his own.

For meals though my mum always made sure we had food. \n\nKeep your stash. This is for you. If you want to share sometimes then share. Your husband needs to stop being a bit of a bully. There's an easy solution. To OP's hubby, buy your own!\n\nNTA. Buy a safe.", "NTA\n\nMy wife and I have different candy stashes. We also have communal candy, and it varies over weeks which of us is over doing the communal stash.\n\nSometimes I put things in the communal stash because I think my wife doesn't care for them. I feel she is much more likely to get into those things when she's had a time of not buying candy on purpose.", "Just get a second stash for him or tell him to make his own and then problem solved", "Info, does one or both of you have an eating disorder or otherwise bad relationship with food?", "NTA, why does it bother him so much??", "I have a stash but it's not secret.  My husband eats all treats immediately so if I am given something I keep it separately until I want to eat it", "NTA.  We do not have to share EVERYTHING with our spouses...especially when we have offered to get them their own.", "I didn\u2019t read past the title to know you are definitely NTA. You\u2019re allowed to be a little selfish, especially when it comes to candy/snacks. \n\nI have hardly ANY self control when it comes to communal candy and snacks; so if my SO was hiding snacks, 1.) it\u2019s for the better 2.) they aren\u2019t mine!\n\nKeeping hiding your candy OP.", "NTA My husband has several secret candy stashes. He also has a secret stash of every DVD with Jennifer Aniston in. I don't touch his candy, but I admit I love a good film with Jennifer in, 'Along came Polly, Just go with it etc.'", "NTA- I\u2019ve always had a secret candy stash. My parents both have candy stashed. My husband has his own stash too. We are really just hiding candy from our kids.", "Your husband is a big, bratty, baby.", "I also have a secret candy stash. Mostly because I don't want to temp my husband who is diabetic. I can eat a bit when I want but keep it out of his site.", "NTA. Signed, someone who keeps snacks by the bed in Ipsy bags and whose mom hides candy in with the kitchen towels.", "I thought everyone did this.  I surprised myself with some gummy bears last weekend because I forgot I stuffed them in the couch cushions.\n\nThe problem with sharing is, that it's not really sharing if one person hogs it all-  meaning you go back a day later and it's all gone. \n\nIt's not a secrets if he knows you do it, just the location is a secrets.  I guess just buy more \"treats\" and put them in random places, throwing him off.", "NAH tbh this just sounds cute almost like a game. There\u2019s nothing wrong with having your own secret stash as long as you make sure there\u2019s some for your husband in the cupboard. \n\nI keep my own secret stash because my partner snacks way more than me so I like to keep some aside when I do the food shopping just so I can enjoy some midnight biscuits or Doritos every now and then. I do always make sure that he and his teenagers (when they\u2019re with us) have plenty of food available and healthy/unhealthy snacks. \n\nIf you reeeeeallly don\u2019t want to share your secret stash, you could always \u201chide\u201d some of his and then let him go hunting", "NTA I\u2019m kinda bummed I\u2019ve not thought of this when so many people have! I have two kids and a husband who always \u2018share\u2019 mine despite having their own. I\u2019m definitely going to start doing this!", "Why not buy him his own when you buy yours?  I mean, really.  If this is your biggest problem in life, your life is pretty damn SWEET!!!!", "This is just too funny. Your husband is jealous of your candy stash! LOL. Thank you so much for the laugh.\n\nOh, and NTA.", "NTA but it's about the principle for him and not about the candies so I can understand why he doesn't like it.\n\nMy GF used to have a \"secret\" stash of cookies ( those big round chocolate ones you see in films), I say \"secret\" because it was the worst kept secret ever. The first few times I found the stash while cleaning, I told her and she changed the spot where she hid it but it was always easy to find, so I simply stopped telling her and acted as if I didn't know where it was. I admit it was quite funny because she would sometime gloat about her secret stash and about the fact I couldn't find it... and I would simply smile and fake ignorance.", "NAH. I understand because I had younger siblings and they take everything but I also see his side because he's so willing to share. Buy him a stash. Don\u2019t ask him if he wants it, just buy a second helping of what you're already getting for yourself. Give it to him and tell him that those are his for when he sees you with yours. Explain to him that food insecurity was a thing for you and this is a way for you to cope with that because the fear never goes away. And it does suck to be looking forward to a treat to find that someone else enjoyed it instead.", "nta, hes being a bit precious about you getting to keep candy you dont have to worry about him eating. enjoy your stash", "NTA\n\nMaybe try saying that you are okay with not hiding it, as long as it's always there for you?

If I wanted something to take home for myself I asked if I could buy it and it would be $5 or less, from laziness of not wanting 2 transactions. \n\nI noticed she never asked my sister and found out she would buy what mom told her to but also buy a bag of groceries for herself without asking. She was working and had money. Mom looked at the receipt and found the total to be high, then looked at the list of things that weren't in the kitchen.", "Do you think it would help diffuse the situation if OP started a secret candy stash for her husband? She keeps it stocked, he can ask for some hidden candy and then she can share without dipping into the reserves she has hidden for herself.", "To me he's a hypocrite for wanting the candy stash when he eats the rest of the ice cream without thinking about OP wanting more.\n\nThat happened with my dad and wine coolers when I was in college and home for the summer. I bought a 4 pack and drank one. Weeks later I'd go looking for another one and when dad asked what I was looking for he said he'd drunk them.", "My husband sometimes keeps a secret candy stash. I don't know where it is or what's in it. \n\nMy husband doesn't really eat candy. He keeps the stash for me.

Almost as much as I love candy (ok, maybe more).", "I have the opposite problem, my wife buys candy and keeps it in an obvious place in a food cupboard, and I have to ask her to keep it somewhere else.

Should I get more\" \"Eh, it's okay. I've just been working on it slowly\" \"CAN I HAVE THE REST THEN!?\" :D", "Husband needs to share.

I\u2019m addicted to sour keys atm \ud83e\udd2a", "Had to reread then look at the comments for the ice cream.\n\nI mean, yeah, kinda? Like wanting OP to \"share\" only to eat more than half? Is that the vibe you're sensing or am I looking into your comment too much?", "Baller move. I like that.", "Yeah it seems like husband should understand having something just to yourself without your partner - like the several bowls of ice cream it sounds like he enjoys without OP - is occasionally a nice treat.", "That's exactly what I'm thinking. No idea if ice cream was a gallon or a pint but husband definitely isn't better at sharing if OP gets one bowl of ice cream only. It never crosses hubby's mind that OP might want more from that container, simply eats it all.\n\nMy guess is he has been like this the whole time and OP just noticed because of the candy stash."]}
