I do not share this with my husband. I don't tell him when I buy candy for it. I don't tell him where I put it. If he finds my secret candy stash (and he knows it exists and goes looking sometimes), I find a new place for it. If he asks me what I have in my candy stash or if I bought something on a recent grocery store trip, I do not tell him.\n\nThis really bothers my husband that I basically am keeping secret treats from him that he can't have, when we share everything else and have shared finances. It's the principle of the matter for him. He doesn't like that I'm willing to be secretive about something, and also that there is something I am not willing to share. I am presently unrepentant though (but willing to hear if I'm the AH, thus the question). I like having a treat that is just mine, that I can have at any point and know exactly how much is left. No looking forward to a treat, only to discover the last of it has already been finished. To be honest, I do like the secrecy of it too and think this is a pretty innocent way of having a secret. I totally do get joy out of quickly sneaking some candy when my husband is out of the house or busy elsewhere in the house.\n\nA few more relevant details:\n\n\\- We have shared finances but money isn't an issue. It's probably one small bag of candy ($3) every 1-2 weeks. I don't drink coffee/get Starbucks, so I feel that's a pretty cheap weekly treat.\n\n\\- I do 70% of the grocery shopping but my husband still goes grocery shopping. I have told him he is welcome to keep his own secret candy stash, and I'm happy to even buy candy for it on one of my trips. He isn't interested. I also do buy shared treats such as ice cream or even candy when I go grocery shopping that gets put in the regular pantry.\n\n\\- I'll admit that my husband is better at sharing than I am, especially food.

Not even over something as silly as candy, because it's the need to \"have a secret\" that's super unhealthy. Also, why do you need to \"sneak\" candy at all \"while your husband is busy\"? You're a grownup. Why would your husband even CARE if you have some candy. Honey...these are things you need to unpack with a therapist. Your husband isn't your parent. You don't need to hide things from him. You shouldn't WANT to hide things from him, or feel like you're being naughty if you do something completely normal like have some candy.", "Pretty minor, but YTA. \n\nIt just seems weird that you have this super weird desire to hide this and have this secret from your husband.

I actually have a secret candy stash as well so it's a touch hypocritical for me to criticize you but your reasons are strange.

You for actually buying and hiding something from your husband (that he looks for) and him for not being responsible enough to share appropriately or get his own.

People who had to compete for food as kids end up wired a bit different when it comes to food insecurity and trusting that there will always be though to go around.", "NTA this is why I call it my PERIOD STASH even though it\u2019s not specifically for that. Men file it away in the \u201clady stuff\u201d section of their brains, which remains dark 99% of the time.\n\nAsk your husband why it\u2019s not ok for you to have one tiny stupid inexpensive thing that is just yours? Why is it worth starting a fight over? Why is it worth potentially driving a wedge into the relationship for, to him?", "NTA \u2014 I feel like this is a fairly common thing in many marriages.  At least with my friends and I.   \n\nMy problem is that where a bag of cookies will last me a week, if my husband finds them, he eats them all in one go.   He does not replace them, so when I go for my one (or two) cookies, I find there are none left.  Drives me insane.  Unless they are labeled DO NOT EAT, he will. Even if he finds them hidden in 3 layers in the far back of a closet where no other food is kept. He\u2019ll say \u201c they didn\u2019t say don\u2019t eat these\u201d.  Otherwise he\u2019s an awesome husband, so I just label and hide.", "NTA\n\nA small candy stash is perfectly reasonable, especially given that you grew up with multiple siblings (I'm the oldest of 5 kids, I KNOW the struggle of craving something only to find someone else has eaten it!!) \n\nI would gently suggest that your husband being bothered by this sounds like codependency or control issues. You do NOT have to share everything; you are separate people. He needs to examine his deeper issues around this, because it's definitely not about candy.", "I don't have a secret stash, I have a \"Do you see this? This is mine! I don't care if it's still there 6mo from now. If I go to eat it and it's gone I will wreck you!\" And that's that.\n\nMy SO is a sugar holic, unless it has peanuts/peanut butter (with some exceptions), if I turn my back it'll be gone. Found out my baking chocolate is almost gone 2 days ago. \ud83d\ude11\n\nNTA for wanting your sweet treat. Your husband needs to respect that boundary.", "NTA you\u2019re allowed to keep some things for yourself and only for you.", "NTA since he prob has some stuff that he hides away and doesn\u2019t share but he shouldn\u2019t be a baby about it and there is certain reasons why it\u2019s hidden and he should respect that HTA.", "YTA  \n\n\nWe teach our children to share and not keep secrets but here you are doing both to your husband. One has to wonder how you would react if he were doing this to you.", "Kids, especially teenagers, are pantry locusts.", "You could occasionally add to it as a surprise \ud83d\ude06", "I have a small stash of candy (milk chocolate nonpareils) that I hide from my housemate, even though he pays for all the groceries. I do it because he will wake up in the middle of the night, wander into the kitchen, and mindlessly eat anything sweet he can find \u2013 and he'll eat a *lot* more of it than is wise or reasonable. (He'll even eat things he doesn't actually like, which is particularly infuriating to me because I *do* like them.) If I left the chocolate out in the kitchen, it would absolutely be gone by the time I woke up the next day, whereas when I keep it hidden from him, it'll last me a week or two because I'll only have a handful at a time. If it weren't for that, I'd be happy to share my chocolate \u2013 but I know that, if I try to share it, I probably won't get much of it, and might not get any.\n\nHe happened to come across my secret stash the other day, and I could tell that he was a little hurt. I felt bad about it, but not bad enough to stop doing it.", ">it's not uncommon for me to for instance buy ice cream for both of us and we both eat a bowl together that day. Then like two days later I'll want to get myself a second bowl and the entire quart is either gone or almost gone.\n\nYour habit is harmless anyway, but this detail really takes it from N A H to NTA.  I'm like you - i enjoy having an occasional treat.  But my husband and kids will finish something off in a day and then I don't get any more of it.  Fairly early on I instituted \"Mom's shelf\".  Most often if I bought something for myself I'd buy a duplicate for the family pantry.  And things were added to the pantry much more frequently than to my shelf.  It meant there'd be a little something available when I wanted it.\n\nMy daughter took my junior minutes from the shelf and ate them all one time.  She got to ride her bike to the store and use her allowance money to replace them.  She never stole from my shelf again.  She would occasionally politely ask if she could have a little of something that was up there and I'd usually give it to her.", "that's annoying that he actively hunts it down and eats it. why can't he buy his own and let you have something for yourself? \ud83d\ude2d", ">He does go looking for my secret stash sometimes because he knows it exists, and will eat some of the candy if he finds it.\n\nI'm interested in this bit in particular. He goes looking for it deliberately, knowing full well that you don't want it to be found and knowing full well he could easily get his own. Then when he finds it, he takes some, again, knowing that it is *yours* and *not his?*\n\nSounds like he just doesn't like you having your own stuff.", "I do it got my husband but usually break into the stash and the bring him a \u201ccoffee cart break\u201d with a fresh cup and the treat (yes. I sing a song as I approach his office)", "What does it actually help with? I've never been pregnant so I'm curious, a couple of people in this thread said they were sour candy lovers during pregnancy.", "It helps with morning sickness, for some reason! Sour helps, and near continual snacking helps, so something like a sour candy you can suck on or munch on gradually is king."]}
