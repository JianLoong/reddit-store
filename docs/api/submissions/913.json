My older sister (28F) was the golden child, and honestly I feel bad for her.\n\nMy sister was a prodigy, she skipped 3 grades, was gifted in both academia and athleticism. And my parents made her life hell.\n\nHer schedule was FULL: school, extracurriculars, sports, music lessons, dance lessons...etc.\nWhen I was very young I was jealous of her, then I turned 10 and started feeling really bad for her. She wasn't allowed friends (they would hold her back), free time (she could have the rest of her life to enjoy after finishing medical school) or even the freedom to chose her future career or her own hobbies (it was all planned for her to maximize her chances to get into Harvard for pre-med, and then Johns Hopkins for med school).\n\nWhen she graduated highschool (at 15 almost 16), my parents uprooted us, becaus they couldn't allow her to go to college on her own, so we left Virginia to go to Massachusetts. I resented them so bad then, but I felt even more sympathy towards my sister, because for years she has been dreaming about finally having some freedom while in college.\n\nThey continued with their intense control over her life. I graduated highschool back in 2016, then in 2018 I left the whole country, that was how much I hated them. I moved to France. Went to school here, and am currently working here.\n\nWhen my sister got into med-school, they still maintained their controlling attitude, then sadly in late 2019 she suffered a drug induced psychotic break. To this day she is still institutionalised necause it developed into full on schizophrenia.\n\nWhen all their hopes they had hung on her ended in nothing (because of them, she started taking drugs because of how stifling they were) they tried to do the same to me. Sadly for them, I was already a self sufficient adult on the other side of an ocean, and they had no control over me.\n\nThey are my sister's legal guardians, so I couldn't cut them off (they are exactly the type of people who would limit my contact with her), and lately they have been pestering me to give them my address, apparently they want to visit me and get to know my BF.\n\nI refused, and keep refusing. But I also feel a bit of guilt. Them knowing my address does not mean that they would be dropping in every weekend, they love in a completely different country, and my refusal is making my mom very sad. Also I have a lot of friends telling that it is unreasonable. So AITA?\n\nEdit: I made an error in my year of graduation and when I moved to France.

Of course it\u2019s a case by case basis and decided by a judge. They are very special cases, in other words.
