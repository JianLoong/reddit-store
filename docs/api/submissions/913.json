My older sister (28F) was the golden child, and honestly I feel bad for her.\n\nMy sister was a prodigy, she skipped 3 grades, was gifted in both academia and athleticism. And my parents made her life hell.\n\nHer schedule was FULL: school, extracurriculars, sports, music lessons, dance lessons...etc.\nWhen I was very young I was jealous of her, then I turned 10 and started feeling really bad for her. She wasn't allowed friends (they would hold her back), free time (she could have the rest of her life to enjoy after finishing medical school) or even the freedom to chose her future career or her own hobbies (it was all planned for her to maximize her chances to get into Harvard for pre-med, and then Johns Hopkins for med school).\n\nWhen she graduated highschool (at 15 almost 16), my parents uprooted us, becaus they couldn't allow her to go to college on her own, so we left Virginia to go to Massachusetts. I resented them so bad then, but I felt even more sympathy towards my sister, because for years she has been dreaming about finally having some freedom while in college.\n\nThey continued with their intense control over her life. I graduated highschool back in 2016, then in 2018 I left the whole country, that was how much I hated them. I moved to France. Went to school here, and am currently working here.\n\nWhen my sister got into med-school, they still maintained their controlling attitude, then sadly in late 2019 she suffered a drug induced psychotic break. To this day she is still institutionalised necause it developed into full on schizophrenia.\n\nWhen all their hopes they had hung on her ended in nothing (because of them, she started taking drugs because of how stifling they were) they tried to do the same to me. Sadly for them, I was already a self sufficient adult on the other side of an ocean, and they had no control over me.\n\nThey are my sister's legal guardians, so I couldn't cut them off (they are exactly the type of people who would limit my contact with her), and lately they have been pestering me to give them my address, apparently they want to visit me and get to know my BF.\n\nI refused, and keep refusing. But I also feel a bit of guilt. Them knowing my address does not mean that they would be dropping in every weekend, they love in a completely different country, and my refusal is making my mom very sad. Also I have a lot of friends telling that it is unreasonable. So AITA?\n\nEdit: I made an error in my year of graduation and when I moved to France.

Sadly it sounds like the parents have conservatorship over her, and those can be notoriously difficult to fight if the conservators (in this case the parents) won't cooperate. \n\nThe parents could indeed decide to legally block contact between the sisters, and there is a solid chance that OP won't be able to do much about it even if they were in the same country. The power balance is pretty messed-up...especially since in this cass it was the conservators who caused this entire situation.", "My sister is a paranoid schizophrenic, she is basically treated like a minor. My parents have the right to control who gets to visit and/or call her.", "There is a big stigma around schizophrenia, and while most people tend to just medicate and live their lives normally, some (my sister included) need to be kept in secure facilities if they are a danger to themselves or other people.", "I've worked in American mental hospitals, and even in the acute hospitalization unit, patients were allowed the use of the phone at stated times. If the patients wanted to call someone long distance who was willing to accept the call, they could talk with them. If the parents are making that threat, it may be a bluff.", "Then why on earth would she meet them anywhere?!! Ridiculous suggestion.", "The way the parents sound, I'm not sure it would be wise for OP to even meet them in France, much less a nearby town.\n\nA nearby town would give them a locality to search within to find her, or inadvertently facilitate being followed.\n\nIf they have to meet somewhere, make it places like London, or Geneva or Brussels, or Amsterdam. Somewhere that will give them no clue as to where OP and her partner are coming from narrower than France. And where it would be easier to ensure the parents can't tail them home.", "Don\u2019t agree to a visit in the first place! They are not good people. They are untrustworthy and dangerous. Keep the ocean between you.", "No no no no no!!! Do not meet them ANYWHERE! EVER!", "> but I would question whether or not OP's disappearance would be detrimental to their sister (depending on her state).\n\nThis will sound harsh but you never put your mental health in jeopardy for someone else. Even if that other person is innocent like her sister is. \n\nAbusers like OPs parents will not stop till they have access to another person to continue the abuse. Since the sister can fulfil that anymore, they are moving on to OP. \n\nIt's a shit situation they are making to emotionally blackmail OP. Most people have empathy and the parents are weaponizing that. \n\nI lost contact with my 2 younger brothers for a few years due to my dad doing this to my mom, and by extension me. They are both abusive and loved to use us kids as pawns.", "If Grandparent's rights are a thing, does OP have any recourse to sue for access in the courts?  Any lawyers here?", "Bot", "I mean, she can definitely contact them and ask them to hear her out. They may be unable to tell her anything about her sister's care, but a note could be placed on her file, perhaps enabling contact. The parents are not jailors.", "That's what I meant by ruining her life over there. If they can they can control him and gain greater control over OP by using him, they'll take it. If not, they'll run him off", "I'm not OP, but I'd at least let the family know so they don't get dragged in, and if they do they can get cut off. But not saying anything lets the the parents control the narrative and potentially create flying monkeys. \n\nAs I said, OP needs to fight to stay free. Those parents will be horrendous if they manage to get their way into OP's life, and I shudder to think that they'd be like if they were let around any grandchildren.", "This my mom is dead and they still try to defend her actions. NTA OP, do not give an inch they will take a mile. Also makes sure they are not trying to transfer care of your sister into your name (as controlling as they sound they definitely have all the info but your curret address to pull this off)", "Oh, I know. It doesn't hurt to look at the options, though. I'd want to know all the facts even if I wasn't going to sue because I'd want to know what control they have and why. I could see the parents exploiting the sister's illness to maintain control. \n\nIf I were OP I'd want to make sure my sister was getting the best care possible and that the parents aren't abusing their position as legal guardians. It doesn't hurt to ask.", "She needs to try to get (trick) them to put in writing that they won\u2019t allow her access to her sister if she won\u2019t do X. Then, hire a lawyer and let them argue her case to have access to the sister, outside of the parents\u2019 span of control.", "I\u2019ve worked in the MI/DD field. There are limits on adult guardianship in most states. It might be worth consulting with a lawyer in the state in which she is institutionalized to get information about your sister\u2019s rights.", "I feel so bad for your sister.  They controlled her when she wasn\u2019t sick and they control her now.", "That is so wrong. I'm so sorry. I'm sure you would get the upper hand if you decided not to tell them. They seem to need to control, and your next. They also need someone if something happens to them. Can you bargain with if you tell them, you get access to your sister without them being able to rescind that access, and get it in writing? At least that would take care of that area, then you stay strong on how much access you grant your toxic parents of your time. Good luck OP.", "God I am so sorry about this. You\u2019re NTA for really obvious reasons.  \n\nI guess the question is if they become more involved in your life, how would you handle it? I think you sound strong & having been through what you\u2019ve been through you\u2019ve made no room for their BS and they know that. I get strong, confident vibes from you after all your trauma. \n\nPeople don\u2019t change but for the sake of your sister I would rethink this. It is true they can\u2019t do much damage an ocean away and if they were to come visit you and act out guess what? Out to the beautiful streets of France they go. You\u2019re in a place where you have the upper hand - as well as are in a position to make demands as they would be guests in your home and home country. After having studied in France one thing is a fact - it\u2019s not the place for anyones bullshit lol. \n\nAgain I say this out of love for your sister and the love you have for her. If your sister had gotten the chance in life to be a successful doctor I\u2019d have a different answer for you but alas. Plus Once they go to meet their creator who will they leave her and their assets to? if that makes senses, more importantly her guardianship.", "Right!? I have a feeling you parents are going to kidnap you, so you should meet them in a different country.", "She needs to buy one of those devices that checks for tracking devices. I wouldn\u2019t put it past OPs parents to plant one on her.", "Honestly I wouldn't even bring the bf with - that's just a disaster waiting to happen as u know they will be on their best sickeningly sweet behavior just for show", "I was wondering the same.", "Her best bet is to hire a lawyer. (No, I'm not a lawyer.)", "If they are unable or unwilling to recognize that they're (extended family) only hearing one side of the narrative (which I would argue is the case, since it sure doesn't sound like any of them care much about the sister), don't waste your breath. Accepting it and protecting yourself is the best way to heal.", "second that.", "They're giving meeting the BF as a reason for visiting OP. Even if she didn't bring him along the first time, they'd keep on that line until he was produced.\n\nBest OP could do there would be making sure the BF knows them for who they are in advance.\n\nAnd while not meeting at all would be the very best option from one angle, it could end up with the parents escalating the threats to cut off OPs communication with her sister. Which makes it less than ideal from another angle.\n\nAltogether an array of not great options to choose from.", "It's a difficult one. OP's parents sound so manipulative. I guarantee all the family heard about was how wellnthe sister was doing, because a kid doing well reflects well on the parents and no parent will admit to abusing their kids for results. Then they'd have got sympathy when the sister got sick, and then it'll be that it's so sad that they've lost both daughters. \n\nIt's hard to know what is going on behind closed doors and I'd at least tell the family, even if the conversation ended with me telling them I'd not be talking to them again. However, a sympathetic family member might at least keep OP in the loop about her sister, so she can at least know how she's doing without having to cater to her parents. If not, at least the truth is out there and OP will have gotten it off her chest so that she can heal. Sometimes you need people to hear what happened, even if it makes no difference; it's getting the words out and finally saying what you've gone through."]}
