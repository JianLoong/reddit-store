I support the LGBTQ+ community and believe everyone has a right to their identity. However, Alex and I have unresolved issues from our childhood. When we were kids, he did something really hurtful to me (unrelated to his gender identity). We never spoke about it, and he never apologized.\n\nWhen he started his transition and asked the family to use he/him pronouns, I told him I would, but only if he apologized for the past incident. My reasoning was that if he expects respect from me regarding his identity, I deserve an apology for the hurt he caused me.\n\nThe family is split. Some think I'm using his identity against him, while others feel I'm justified in wanting an apology. \n\nAITA for this condition?\n\n*Edit* since everyone wants to know what he did: When I told him I thought I might be a lesbian in confidence he went around telling everyone and made extremely homophobic remarks. So I want an appolgy since he is now a member of the LGBTQ+ community.", "created_utc": 1691780378, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ohevt/aita_for_refusing_to_use_my_trans_brothers/", "score": 175, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No way to judge is we don't know. \n\n\"He tried to murder me\" wouldn't have the same verdict has \"he stole my lollipop\"", "ESH after reading your response to the childhood incident.

Otherwise, disrespect and harm is cool?\n\nNo, that's not how it works.\n\nYou are well within your rights to say you will use NO pronouns (and not speak to or speak of a person) without an apology, but intentional disrespect on a very basic level is not ok.", "This is a hard one.\n\n\nBrother  outted you as a lesbian.\n\nAnd then verbally abused you for being a lesbian.\n\nNow that he has leapt out of the closet and has become a part of the very group of people he used to be prejudiced against, he wants to glitterwash his past actions.\n\nHe is totally TA for that and you do deserve a heartfelt and sincere apology.\n\nBut not calling someone their preferred name, pronouns etc if just rude as fuck even if the name is their actual birth name or just a nickname even.\n\nESH.\n\nCall him what he wants but if I were you I would just never call on him going forward because he showed you that he will never have your back.", "YTA - Why does this have anything to do with respecting his identity? Sounds like the situations have nothing to do with one another - you can respect his identity while also being angry at him for hurting you in the past. There\u2019s a very very slight possibility that you\u2019re NTA based on whatever he did to you, but i\u2019m assuming it doesn\u2019t correlate at all and has nothing to do with his identity so YTA.", ">I support the LGBTQ+ community and believe everyone has a right to their identity.\n\nVery clearly not true.

You for holding onto this grudge for so many years, and not respecting his gender identity.

Surely if you then refuse now to use his correct pronouns , then aren't you stooping to the same level ? Be the bigger person, use his pronouns .. and perhaps you might get that apology.\nBut to be totally honest YTA because it's not really the bigger person or not - deadnaming, misgendering etc .. it's transphobia and never ok. It's not something you can use in order to get an apology. He, is no longer a she, and you can't decide he is a she until he says what you want.

You don\u2019t combat homophobia with transphobia. Also did you think that maybe his gender identity was causing internalised issues with the LGBT so he acted that way to try and hide the fact he\u2019s trans because he had ent accepted it yet? Still owes an apology but could be an explanation. Hate him for what he said but that doesn\u2019t mean refusing to use his correct gender", "ESH\n\nJust stop talking to him. You don\u2019t need to misgender him or anything else, just flat out ignore him. Tell him that until he apologizes and demonstrates he is no longer a homophobe, you don\u2019t speak to him.", "NTA. \n\nOP: I want an apology for you outing me to everyone and making a bunch of homophobic insults after I confided in you. \n\nOP Brother: No. \n\nI can't even say ESH because any ordinary person would have ALREADY apologized by now. OP is at the point of blackmailing for an apology and he still refuses. I'm honestly trying to figure out why it's something he just refuses to do?", "ESH\n\nSure your actions might be seen as transphobic right now, but your brother is also homophobic. Y\u2019all are a match made in heaven I guess.", "Gotta admit, as I was reading, I really wanted to know what that past incident was... and since the past incident involves him outing you against your will AND making fun of you for your LGBT+ identity, I can totally understand why you are reluctant to lean into his LGBT+ identity.  However, I also feel like these two things are not equivalent.  He was a fucking asshole for outing you against your will and before you were ready, breaking your trust, and ridiculing you, but he didn't straight up deny who you were.  All the same, I feel that you are perfectly entitled to the anger you feel and the grudge that you hold, and you would be owed an apology whether or not he was LGBT+ but his behavior is ESPECIALLY hypocritical based on that.\n\nI think that you are both old enough, however, to have an adult conversation.  Don't be like, \"I'll use your pronouns if you apologize.\"  Instead, take a moment to let him know how hurtful his behavior was.  That you trusted him and in turn, he betrayed you.  He potentially put you in danger by outing you to others.  He hurt you by belittling you and making homophobic remarks.  Ask him how he honestly feels, looking back on that behavior, and if he HONESTLY believes you are not owed an apology.\n\nIf he digs in and doubles down, I feel like it won't be a matter of rejecting his identity.  I think it will be a matter of acknowledging his existence.\n\nBecause of that, I'm going to say ESH... I understand where you're coming from, but that doesn't give you the right to reject your brother's identity.", "I mean regardless of your feelings about the person and how much you hate them, misgender someone is always wrong.\n\nI do understand the hurt, but i recommend just not misgender him and go directly to NC instead until he apologizes. \n\nIn the end, Misgender him is only going to cause problems to you", "AITA for degrading him as a human being for something that happened when he was a kid? yeah YTA", "NTA.  He should apologize for being a bigot and outting you.  He had no issues with homophobia.", "Yes! YATA  It\u2019s an act of transphobia.  Regardless of what they did it\u2019s not an excuse.   Because then you push that ignorant behaviour onto others.  If you truly supported the LGBTQ+ community you wouldn\u2019t be intentionally misgendering them especially around others ESPECIALLY for an incident that was completely unrelated to their gender.

You are adults now, and sure it would be nice if he apologized for the incident in your childhood, but holding his identity against him until is does so is....childish and transphobic. Perhaps if you used his pronouns and bonded, he'd come to you and apologize for the hurt it caused you. Either way, his name / pronouns and the incident from your childhood are not the same, and conflating them in your mind is causing harm when it doesn't need to. Your brother was a child (presumedly) when this incident occurred, yes? Don't continue to act like a child with this misplaced tit for tat bullshit.", "YTA. It sounds like one incident has nothing to do with the other, so how does misgendering your brother do anything to address your past issues?", "YTA. \n\nWhile he's also a big A for refusing to apologize for an incident in which he was clearly in the wrong, making your respect of someone's pronouns, identity, or chosen name contingent on that apology from an incident that wasn't even recent makes YTA here.\n\nAlso, please stop pretending you. \"support\" the LGBTQ community when you're literally here asking if you'd be an asshole if you choose to be transphobic because you think the other person \"deserves it\".", "YTA, pronouns aren't a reward for good behaviour.

It also seems that within the LGBT community, the LGB elements seem to be second class citizens whilst the T segment seems to dictate things.
