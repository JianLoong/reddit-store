You're signing on to a lot more than just being a spouse.   \n\n\nI still think OP handled this like an AH, but it seems pretty clear that both of them need to sit down and agree what responsibilities they will have going forward.", "if she goes back to work, he\u2019s not gonna have his free babysitter/housekeeper/cook to take care of thing so that he can be \u201cthe man\u201d and make money. i think she\u2019s done with the situation and him.", "Not her kids. She\u2019s specifically going back to work to get away from these kids and him making her responsible for these kids. YTA take care of your own children!", "yes this \u261d\ud83c\udffc\n\nOP, you have been saddling your gf with parental duties and thinking that being the one bringing in the income makes you the parent equally. it doesn\u2019t. she\u2019s been dealing with your mental load (your kids) on top of everything else and wants out. \n\nYTA OP. **YOU** are the parent, and when you found out about her interview, **YOU** should have made alternative arrangements for your kids.", "Also sounds like he was trying to sabotage the interview so that the girlfriend/nanny/maid/housekeeper could continue with her duties and he can just bring in the \"income\". I hope the lady gets this job and regains her financial independence. Definitely YTA", "Bang maid.", "I second this.", "I think she probably did. Why else would he call to remind her to do something she does every day?", "I can only assume he did know when the interview was, because for some reason he called THAT DAY to remind her THAT DAY at that EXACT TIME to pick up the kids. If she does it every day, why would he choose THAT day and time to remind her? Wouldn\u2019t it be compulsory? Wouldn\u2019t he not even think about it?", "I suspect he knew the interview would interfere with the pick up, which means he should have arranged something else. I doubt he calls her every day to remind her it\u2019s \u201cher responsibility \u201c.", "Seconding this. Why did he call her to remind her to pick up the kids? Does he do that every day? Or did he do it because she had told him she had an interview then, he didn't make other arrangements (because he refuses to care for his children), and was trying to force her to pick up the kids/tank the interview?", "I think that is the issue, she had arrangements. The person couldn't but never let OP know they couldn't until it was too late.", "It\u2019s almost as if he resents her for gaining more independence instead of being readily available to pick up his slack with HIS kids.", "This is what I thought, too. But it is odd to me that he reached out to remind her to pick up the kids. I wonder why this day he felt she needed a reminder? She could have communicated that other arrangements needed to be made and OP outright ignored and wanted her to pick up regardless? Hard to tell from the way it is written.", "Even a nanny gets a day off tho, sounds like OP wouldn\u2019t want that", "This- she\u2019s his girlfriend and not a wife. I know there are no guarantees in life, but one can more or less safely assume the wife will stick around for the kids- what\u2019s your parenting plan if your girlfriend just takes off one day and dumps you?", "That's what people valued back in the day. Parenting meant doing the basics of having money to pay for housing, food etc... \n\nYou'd think someone in their 30s would recognize that parenting is so much more that, but some people are just less evolved", "Because raising the children and being an available parent is women\u2019s work.", "Eh, even my parents had conflict of schedual, didn't mean either of them were less committed", "Yes the bit when he phoned her up to remind her means he knew she had an interview so why couldn't he pick them up? YTA she's your gf not your secretary tc, great if she's free to pick them up but ultimately its up to you", "Thirded", "Exactly this. He was trying to \"remind\" her that he is in control of her time", "So true! I'd feel bad for the nanny."]}
