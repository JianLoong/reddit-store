The fact is with an evicted on her record is going to be nearly impossible for her to find a place.\n\nSo if she hasn\u2019t stayed 30 days get her out now. If she is over 30 days contact a lawyer to start eviction process.", "NTA, she is selfish bitch, who needs a big favor, but doesn't respect you. She makes only your life harder, so you were absolutly right to do so. Maybe sometime she learn her main life lesson then her biggest life problem is herself.", "NTA\n\nShe is the guest at your place, you let her know the rules, and she must have accepted them otherwise she wouldn't have move with you.

That's all on her.", "Cut and dry NTA.  Sounds like SHE'S not taking her situation seriously.  But it's not your problem and it's extremely wrong of her to inflict herself upon you when you were just trying to do a good deed.  Tell her to grow up and GTFO.", "NTA.   \nShe has called you selfish for not taking her situation seriously - you asked her to just respect your boundaries and be more respectful of cohabitating, and her response was for *you* to stop being so uptight. \n\nYour sister had an opportunity to get back on her feet and she threw it in your face.

You were extremely gracious to allow her to move in with you, and if she's not being a good roommate she can be kicked out.  You may need to look at the legal nuts and bolts of evicting\u2010it varies from location to location and much is dependent on if she is a roommate or a houseguest.  I imagine one afternoon on the internet could give you the information you need.", "NTA- you\u2019re allowing her to stay at your place. The least she could do is be respectful of your wishes. NTA at all since she\u2019s acting entitled and selfish", "NTA. Tell her she gets zero right to say how uptight you are or not. But also that the way she behaved got her evicted and that she has no right to do things that can get you evicted. She's not paying rent, she doesn't get to use your apartment how she wants, she gets to use the apartment how you want and if she wants her own place and her own choices, she can get her own apartment.", "NTA- she's the one \"not taking her situation seriously.\"", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo wonder she got evicted from her apartment, I bet it was far more than just rent problems.", "NTA people who don\u2019t respect boundaries after you already lent them a hand to ease their situation tend to not take things seriously", "NTA. My sister did this to my other sister, eventually convinced her to upgrade her apartment to a 2 bedroom and they could live together. She never paid a dime of rent and my sister is still recovering financially 2 years later. Get her out asap.", "NTA - we can all see why she got kicked out of her place. She is rude, doesnt take care of her responsibilities and doesnt seem to care about other peoples property. None of which is YOUR problem. Bye bye sis", "nta... its also not cool you moved someone in without landlords permission...assuming you didnt since most landlords dont accept anyine with evictions.", "NTA - Its your apartment, and you can be uptight as you want. She is not there as your guest, you are doing her a favor and she is taking advantage.", "I own the apartment so it's not a problem", "fair enough", "Nta", "NTA. This is why she got evicted from her last place and will find it hard to get a new one. Take your self seriously and kick her out. She can stay with her hard partying friends.", "NTA. Play stupid games win stupid prizes. Sounds like she\u2019s in the fuck around stage and should be kicked into the find out stage", "NTA boundaries mentioned in the post are more than reasonable someone with such limited options needs to remember beggars can\u2019t be choosers", "NTA It seems like your sister is sabotaging you by trying to get you kick out of the apartment as well.

Not your fault she was evicted.  You don't owe her space in your home.  Simple as that.", "NTA.

Your sister that's who. She's a guest and she should have followed your rules because you allowed her to stay and she doesn't seem to care.

She took advantage of your kindness and she didn't care to follow the rules.", "NTA\n\nThe only one not taking her situation seriously is her.

Now she is receiving natural consequences for her actions and choices.", "Honestly is it so foreign to people to RESPECT the HOME they are in? I mean I've seen several of these posts and it truly boggles my mind that guests come in to your home and straight up disrespect the rules in place.

There are tons of really good ones around where I live, I work with homeless people. There are places that take young women and help them find places that are within their budget.", "Otherwise she wouldn\u2019t be wasting money in hosting parties for her friends", "She probably vomited on someone else\u2019s porch or had a screaming match while everyone was asleep.", "The person not taking her situation seriously is sister, she should be acting like a saint while living with someone for free and spending all her free time trying to better her situation and looking for a new place.  I\u2019d give her a written contract and a time limit with stipulations on expected behavior"]}
