I am from Canada and I am undergoing the process of getting my work visa that will transition to a permanent residency eventually. I have gone through school to be a high school world history teacher here and have to do my in-school placements after I get my work visa to secure a job in Australia if I want one. My partner is high up in a large business and makes high 6 figures a year combined with the fact that he also rents out properties that he bought and renovated. He doesn't flaunt his wealth but he has paid for my flights and his flights when we come over to see each other. \n\nHe decided that last night would be a good time to introduce me to his family. (He will never meet mine because I was emotionally and psychologically mistreated by my father when I was young. He used to call me all sorts of names and treated me differently because I'm a girl.) His Mum and Dad are lovely and welcomed me with open arms. His older brothers (38M and 40m), were not as warm. Both of them are married to Aussie girls. \n\nWe settled in for dinner, and I pulled out the dessert I had made at my partner's house from a cooler and, with his mum's help, placed it in the freezer, (Baked Alaska, which has to be kept chilled, to keep the ice cream from melting). The food was wonderful and I received many compliments on my baking. I volunteered to help do the dishes with his mother after we ate. As I was drying the dishes I looked at the table where the rest of the family were talking and asked if anyone would like a drink.\n\nMy partner immediately said no and that we would be going soon and he would have me make him one when we got back to his place. At this point, his brothers had been making housewife jokes, because of my willingness to make food and clean for the family, but this caused them to burst out laughing. One called me his mail-order bride and the other said maybe I would be sure to lick his boots when we got home.\n\nI shook it off and made polite conversation with his mum as we prepared to leave when one of his brothers yelled \"Be sure to bring the (insert slur, female genitals starts with c) back sometime.\"\n\nI kind of froze up as that word is one of the slurs my dad used to call me. My breath cut short and I turned around and glared at him saying \"Don't you ever, ever, call me that.\" before storming out of the house. \n\nHis brother called my partner and told him I'm a bitch that needs to get used to Aussie slang and customs. His other brother agrees. My partner is angry because he knows what my dad put me through and won't stand for it when people insult me. His parents are neutral due to the supposed common use of the word and the way I felt about it.

It's so weird to hate on Canadians here. You're our northern hemisphere cousins.", "Ah I understand then -- you are one of us!\n\nLOL the two feet of snow we had this winter is juuust retreating across my lawn. But it's still below zero and glittery cold at night. \n\nI hope you are enjoying the heck out of  your 28\\* sunshiney days!!!", "Wrong. That's all of NSW. Everyone knows that.", "Strongly disagree. Even in lower socio economic circles in Australia you would never call a woman a c- to her face or say it to/in front of her partner without expecting to get hit over the head with a chair/kicked out of the bar/punched in the face.", "My partner is already starting to complain that it's getting cold.... I'm speechless. I have to bring him home for winter, then he can complain about the cold lol.", "It depends a lot of tone and context too. I am Canadian but have been shacked up with an English man for over a decade. I had an Irish guy come into my store one day when I worked in retail and he thought he had lost his wallet. I could see it in his back pocket and didn't say anything but I did laugh when he finally found it. He looked at me and said oh you c---- you knew it was there didn't you. Then he realized what he said and was super apologetic. I was laughing so hard as I knew he didn't mean it in a bad way. It just sort of slipped out. This situation with OP was different and they were well frankly acting like c---s toward her.", "It doesn't matter where you grow up but if you spend your whole life hearing the same terms then you invariably adopt them as well.", "LOL well you'll have to buy him a parka. But at least nobody here will call him a C-word."]}
