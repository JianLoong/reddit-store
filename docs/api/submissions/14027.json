I am from Canada and I am undergoing the process of getting my work visa that will transition to a permanent residency eventually. I have gone through school to be a high school world history teacher here and have to do my in-school placements after I get my work visa to secure a job in Australia if I want one. My partner is high up in a large business and makes high 6 figures a year combined with the fact that he also rents out properties that he bought and renovated. He doesn't flaunt his wealth but he has paid for my flights and his flights when we come over to see each other. \n\nHe decided that last night would be a good time to introduce me to his family. (He will never meet mine because I was emotionally and psychologically mistreated by my father when I was young. He used to call me all sorts of names and treated me differently because I'm a girl.) His Mum and Dad are lovely and welcomed me with open arms. His older brothers (38M and 40m), were not as warm. Both of them are married to Aussie girls. \n\nWe settled in for dinner, and I pulled out the dessert I had made at my partner's house from a cooler and, with his mum's help, placed it in the freezer, (Baked Alaska, which has to be kept chilled, to keep the ice cream from melting). The food was wonderful and I received many compliments on my baking. I volunteered to help do the dishes with his mother after we ate. As I was drying the dishes I looked at the table where the rest of the family were talking and asked if anyone would like a drink.\n\nMy partner immediately said no and that we would be going soon and he would have me make him one when we got back to his place. At this point, his brothers had been making housewife jokes, because of my willingness to make food and clean for the family, but this caused them to burst out laughing. One called me his mail-order bride and the other said maybe I would be sure to lick his boots when we got home.\n\nI shook it off and made polite conversation with his mum as we prepared to leave when one of his brothers yelled \"Be sure to bring the (insert slur, female genitals starts with c) back sometime.\"\n\nI kind of froze up as that word is one of the slurs my dad used to call me. My breath cut short and I turned around and glared at him saying \"Don't you ever, ever, call me that.\" before storming out of the house. \n\nHis brother called my partner and told him I'm a bitch that needs to get used to Aussie slang and customs. His other brother agrees. My partner is angry because he knows what my dad put me through and won't stand for it when people insult me. His parents are neutral due to the supposed common use of the word and the way I felt about it.

You're a guest, meeting his parents for the first time. You acted like a host. You didn't just bring a little something to be polite - like a bottle of wine or flowers - you contributed to the meal, you cleaned while the men sat at the table, you then acted as host in someone else's home and **as a first time guest** asked if you could provide anyone with a drink. At which your partner intervened and clarified you would be making him one at home as he wanted to leave soon. The whole family is aware there is a power imbalance between you two as he makes significantly more money than most people and is older than you. \n\nAre you trying to become a Stay At Home Girlfriend/Wife? Were you raised in an environment where it was normal for women to wait on men hand and foot? It was rude, malicious & out of order for the brother to call you a mail-order-bride. But can you see that a woman from another country who on the first time meeting everyone offered to serve everyone drinks, in someone elses home, that's behaviour that unfortunately made the 'mail-order-bride' insult seem fitting? Are you aware your behaviour was too much at this dinner? Are you aware that a first time guest offering drinks to everyone in someone else's home can be considered insulting to the hosts and rude guest behaviour?", "NTA OP. I am Australian and while that word is used very commonly and jovially, the way they used it was meant as 100% an insult.

He intended to demean and insult you. NTA.", "After reading this over I\u2019m almost certain that the brothers were calling him that word not you.

You didn\u2019t know that he wasn\u2019t talking to you, you just defended yourself from a perceived insult. NAH", "NTA. Australian here- you don't \"need to get used to\" being insulted and degraded with misogyny to 'fit in'. As someone who moved overseas and married an American- the \"mail order bride\" comments are also freaking terrible, and the whole interaction reeks of xenophobia.

I'm assuming your in Adelaide, OP, first things first. The use can be a double meaning. There is it used as banter between mates, as a term of endearment, and general shooting the shit. But then there is the other meaning of it when it isn't used as banter and used in a way that you can tell the person is being degrading. Your BFs brother used it in a way thats degrading you. NTA. I say that word mostly in banter and shooting the shit. But never really use it in degrading way", "Nta. That was definitely said in a mean way and also, as an aussie myself, im sure we are well aware that it isnt a common word in basically every other country and is highly offensive to a lot of people.

I'm kinda desensitized to it now and will (very rarely) drop it myself. But only ever with those two people who I know are comfortable with it!!! It's such a divisive word that you just would never drop it to someone you had just met especially in the way OP describes. It sounds disgusting and objectifying.\n\n\nNot representative of Aussies.

I didn't offer the drinks until after his mum asked me if I wanted anything to drink, I said no, but she asked it in front of everyone else and I feel it rude to exclude the other people at the table from an offer.

Basically, it means \u201cYou and I know each other so well that I can use this highly insulting word and we both know you wont be offended by it\u201d. The way your bfs brother used it, in such a derogatory context, means he meant it as an insult. Intention matters when using that word and he didn\u2019t intend it as a compliment.

You acknowledge your family was abusive. Sometimes, those of us who were raised in abusive households, (*I was raised in one too*) we absorb a lot of things that we don't ever realise aren't normal. Things that weren't obviously abusive so we don't realise they aren't ok. And we only learn this the hard way. So for example:\n\n>I was raised in an environment where I was expected to drop everything to help others, even if it caused detriment to myself\n\nthat's not a healthy standard to hold yourself too. It's not a healthy mindset to have. Or to expect others to have. Help others yes. But not to your detriment. \n\n>his mum asked me if I wanted anything to drink, I said no, but she asked it in front of everyone else and I feel it rude to exclude the other people at the table from an offer. \n\nWould you describe yourself as a people pleaser? The host asked you, the guest, if you wanted a drink. You said no. For next time, that's the end of interaction. You don't have to always worry about everyone else. Especially as the host is their Mum & Dad. If their Mum didn't think it was necessary to ask her kids if they wanted a drink, than you're not going to know better than their Mother. They were at home. Maybe Mum & Dad assumed their kids are comfortable helping themselves? \n\nAnd have you considered your boyfriend is the person who gave his brother the greenlight to talk trash about you? It might not have been conscious. But publicly saying, \"*we're leaving soon, you can fix me a drink when we get home*\" let everyone at that table know your boyfriends expects to be served by you. It also sounds a little like an order. I think his brother than said what he said because he didn't expect your bf to defend you. Because that sentence from your bf was very disrespectful to you. Whenever I'm doing too much, by bf always quietly tells me, *\"you don't have to do that/offer to do that\"*. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with bringing your bf drinks, snacks etc. But it should be 50/50. He should also be fixing you drinks & snacks too.
