You're a good big brother and a good father!", "NTA - but I don't know if you're going about it the right way. You want to make sure your brother doesn't feel any tension as it isn't his fault he has an older dad. I think maybe you need to chat to your dad and work something out because as you said you are looking after his kid the majority of the time. Just keep in mind your dad might know you are right and hates that he can't keep up with his kid so could be a sensitive topic. \n\nDon't take this constructive criticism as anything but a possble constructive way to approach. You are clearly a great dad and brother and definitely NT a A.", "Been right there AS the child that is related to their 1 year older UNCLE.  Dad was \"winging it\" when he got a child at 50.  He has always been \"winging it\", and DROPPING it in your lap.  He should be apologizing to HIS children/and his grandchild....

Incarnating someone you cant or wont care for is one of the most fucked up things you can do in my opinion.", "NTA. I couldn\u2019t imagine being in your shoes! Gross behavior from your dad.

When you say the girlfriend is not stable...   do you mean financially or mentally or ?  \n\nI am just asking because I am trying to determine how big of a challenge your dad threw at you here. Either way it sounds a bit rough.", "NTA. If you were still living at home, watching your brother 60% of the time because your dad had no energy, everyone would say he parentified you and had no business having a kid at 50. While I kinda agree with some comments that there was no *need* to tell him this, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to point out that his decisions were bad and it\u2019s led to you needing to basically raise your brother alongside your own child.", "NTA though what you said was very AH-ish. It CAN be done. My husbands father adopted him at age 55. But his health failed, his young son had to give up his future to care for him, and he passed too soon. Which is an aspect and frustration y\u2019all are missing. While some can, this man is physically unable to care for his son and doesn\u2019t seem to express appreciation for the fact that his oldest provides majority of care and will likely take in his baby brother when he passes in the future. This is a huge responsibility that\u2019s pretty much been forced on OP, who has no obligation to show respect to his dad. Just because you could doesn\u2019t mean you should.", "There's a lot of great involved fathers that had kids in their 50. Your father is not taking care of his son but that's not necessarily related to age or is it?", "INFO: What was your relationship like with your father before he had your brother? What was it like when you were the age your brother is now? \n\nI'll be transparent, I'm asking this because you seem to be uncaring about your father's current circumstances, as it relates to his health. Is that earned? Did he neglect you in some way also? Is he repeating patterns?", "Nta, there's an age limit for having kids.", "ESH\n\nYour dad had a kid he is in no shape to really care for and you ended up with the  majority of the caring. That was a bad decision. No one should have a kid they are not ready to handle. No one should be pawning off their responsibility to parent to others. \n\nBut, the way you handled it was not ideal either. You just lashed out at him, 7 years too late, and when he was down. It can be truth but still said in a better way.  At the end of it, there is no real good that can come out of it. While I can understand you needing to vent your frustrations, the time and the way was bad.", "YTA. I\u2019m going to try to give as much feedback as possible without seeming vitriolic. The lack of empathy for your father is honestly sad. It doesn\u2019t matter if he had a child at 15 or 50 or 70, someone should not be shamed for having a kid and it\u2019s ultimately their decision. He\u2019s your brother, like it or not, but you\u2019re going to have to be there for him. It\u2019s not your dad\u2019s fault that he has health conditions\u2014shit happens. But you don\u2019t get to have a say in people\u2019s actions. Being mad at your dad is one of the worse ways to approach this situation. I understand that you might be mad that he can\u2019t support him, but grow the fuck up. You\u2019re 32 years old, and you\u2019re being stubborn and disrespecting your father. Be happy that you have a brother, and look at the positives in this scenario. I recommend you apologize to your dad. Him not being in the best condition + your negativity only adds to his suffering. Please stop, and grow up. Thanks!", "YTA. WTF makes you think you can judge someone else like that?\n\nYou didn\u2019t say, but it seems possible you don\u2019t know why he really ended up being a dad so late. Maybe he didn\u2019t think it through, or maybe it was unplanned, or maybe the mom went against his wishes. Regardless of what he may be telling or not telling you, keep in mind that you may not know the full story", "I don't think your dads age has anything to do with this. He's not unique. Many males have kids into the 80's. You mentioned a heat attack. Was this before or after 7yo. I gather mom isn't in the picture st all. If he had the heart attack after kid was born , shame on him knowing he had this. If it occurred before hand, it wasn't his fault IMO", "Yta ...", "INFO\n\n> I sarcastically said my brother is pretty much with me anyways.

Did you believe anything constructive was going to happen? Or were you just lashing out in frustration? \n\nYou're 100% right, but I do feel like YTA for saying it the way you did.", "YTA. Either you're being ageist or your already complicated relationship with your dad is just assuming that as its most convenient form. Plenty of older parents do fine. He may just not be a good parent overall no matter his age, considering how he did with you.", "YTA. You have no empathy for your sibling or your dad. My friend had his first kid at fifty. It wasn't ideal but it is how it happened.", "YTA. My cousins were 18 & 19 when my aunt and uncle (their parents, obviously) got pregnant. Ironically, turns out my cousin was also pregnant at the same time. So now my cousin\u2019s daughter and her mother\u2019s daughter are the same age. My other cousin had their first just a couple years later so they\u2019re all around the same age. Yeah, it\u2019s weird when your uncle is the same age as you, but they are all now teenagers and they all have a great relationship. It is what it is. Being salty about it doesn\u2019t exactly make it better, now does it? FYI people can have heart issues at any day. I was only in my twenties when my heart stopped and they discovered that I have long qt syndrome, which is also known as sudden death syndrome. You blaming your father for his heart attack isn\u2019t productive and the fact is health issues can strike at any time. So let him live his life how he chooses and stop making things worse when you don\u2019t have to. You can have negative feelings about your dad but none of this helps your brother, who did nothing to deserve being in the midst of these negative emotions.", "YTA, what you said you said to be hurtful.

It's understandable that you have concerns about your father's ability to raise a child at his age, but shaming him and belittling his choices is not productive or respectful.

This is not your place \u2026 move out would be a good alternative", "YTA\n\nHave you ever asked him if he asked his girlfriend to get an abortion? He didn't give birth.
