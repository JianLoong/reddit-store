The lack of empathy for your father is honestly sad. It doesn\u2019t matter if he had a child at 15 or 50 or 70, someone should not be shamed for having a kid and it\u2019s ultimately their decision.

I understand that you might be mad that he can\u2019t support him, but grow the fuck up. You\u2019re 32 years old, and you\u2019re being stubborn and disrespecting your father. Be happy that you have a brother, and look at the positives in this scenario. I recommend you apologize to your dad. Him not being in the best condition + your negativity only adds to his suffering. Please stop, and grow up. Thanks!", "YTA. WTF makes you think you can judge someone else like that?\n\nYou didn\u2019t say, but it seems possible you don\u2019t know why he really ended up being a dad so late.

I was only in my twenties when my heart stopped and they discovered that I have long qt syndrome, which is also known as sudden death syndrome. You blaming your father for his heart attack isn\u2019t productive and the fact is health issues can strike at any time.
