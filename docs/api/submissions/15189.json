He may feel he is looking out for you (I also think he has feelings for you) but this is not the way to go about it. You are an adult who is capable of making autonomous decisions.

I saw your responses and want to say that yes its hard, especially when others gang up on you BUT, until you stop doing what he says he will never stop. \n\nTry and find another student that you can room with maybe. But in the end, stand up for yourself ALWAYS, never back down. If you let people treat you like a doormat, they will.

If he is attempting to control your life now, it will be 1,000 times worse if you have a relationship with him.  His behavior is certainly manipulative and bordering on abusive, if not already there.  And you are just seeing the tip of the iceberg.  Cut him off completely if you can.

Do not let him win.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA\n\nWtf. Girl, you need a restraining order! This is at least borderline stalking!\n\n  The fact that it makes you uncomfortable should be enough for your family to ask him to stop. Or for him to respect your feelings and back off. I don't know why they aren't responding this way, but it is definitely over the top. Set all the boundaries you need.

TELL THEM.", "While I agree with you, I think it's best not take such a financial risk. Move out after you get a job. If you cut them off now, as your uni is near now, it can set off a trigger."]}
