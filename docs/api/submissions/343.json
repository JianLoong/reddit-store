He applied to Amazon and was waiting to get the job for about two weeks. Then after the interview, he was waiting to start for another two weeks. During that time, I tried to be as helpful as possible because his job meant a lot to him. But during this in between time, he did ABSOLUTELY nothing. Like he didnt even get up to make himself a plate of food. He just asked for it and expected it to be made for him. \n\nI tried to communicate with him that i needed help because i work and im in college. But he'd just say hes depressed and should be allowed to be depressed. We have a kid and between all the other things i have going in, I was having a hard time. I ended up having to front money for his bills (we do not share expenses, i pay for our son, its a separate situation) and some more unexpected issues came up with his car.\n\nHe's a nervous driver so i drove for the first month. The interview was an hour and half away. I drove. He started working nights four days a week and then he dropped down to two days, I had to do my classes via zoom while driving him. The last two or three weeks, I made him drive because I was getting behind on my school work and was only getting 5 hours or less night. He complained and said it wasn't fair, he's not ready, I'm being too forceful. The last drive I went on with him he was telling me the directions. So I figured he was ready.\n\nThis week was rough. My grandmother is dying in the hospital, my battery on my car died and I got stranded, my son and I have been sick all week, so last night I couldn't take him. So he didn't go to work. Tonight, I was feeling better but I need to catch up on school work so I told him to go on his own. It was a whole argument about how I needed to take him and I wasn't being considerate. But he ended up going anyway.\n\nNow, here's why I made him go alone: I felt like he was ready, he was telling me all the turns and even on the last trip, I fell asleep. Second, he's irresponsible. He expects me to remember everything for him and if he forgets anything I'm to blame for it. Then we got into this huge argument about how I act like his mom by telling him what to do. But I tell him things like \"Finally go and get your license\" or \"the tags on your car are about to expire, go to the MVA\" or \"stop eating in the bed,  I found roach in my ear.\" \n\nI cannot hold his hand the entire way. I need time to focus on my school work too. So am I the asshole for not wanting to drive with him to work anymore?", "created_utc": 1667184342, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhyn1z/aita_for_not_driving_my_fianc\u00e9_to_work/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's more than likely no longer depressed and is using it to get you to do things for him because he enjoys it. You may have a kid together but he's becoming detrimental to your health, school work and ability to be the best parent you can be. You seriously need to consider leaving in the best interest of both yourself and your child. Good luck.\n\nEta: That people (almost always) who are depressed won't tell you what to do. They just won't care enough to do it nor care enough to get someone else to do it for them because they just don't care about anything or themselves anymore. There sounds to be like other mental issues other than depression. But stop letting him use that excuse to bring you down to such a level.", "NTA", "Your life would be much easier and nicer if you left this man you know. It might even be good for him, since he'd be forced to grow up.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYou would be if you continue to be his mom and not his fiance. Time for him to step up or step off.", "I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t even finish reading your post but may I ask why are you with him? Depression or not he is a father and a partner and before anyone comes for me. I have been depressed before during and after my last pregnancy. I had to actually put effort to get better bc I have little humans who depend on me being well. \n\nI hate to say this but in my opinion you are better off being on your own with your kid. I get it you should help him he is the father of your child and your partner but once you cross the line and you put your own mental and physical health in jeopardy and also your time and school and he doesn\u2019t put any effort what so ever. That\u2019s when you should say enough is enough. Your child needs at least one parent who can take care of him. Hope he starts working on getting better for the sake of himself and y\u2019all\u2019s child.", "NTA. It looks to me like he is looking for a Mother, not a girlfriend.  I hope you see how much you deserve and that it's ok to want more than a relationship where you are a babysitter.", "NTA", "NTA. Honestly I think you know what needs to be done here. We've all had enough life experience to know that adults like this stay like this. Is this shit you want to put up with everytime he hits a bump in the road? Depression is one thing, using it to make someone wait hand and foot on you is another and its weaponized", "NTA. Rethink this \u201crelationship\u201d. You have your plate full and he\u2019s drowning you in his drama. He does nothing to help himself. \n\nYour child, health, and college must be the priority. He makes everything difficult. Demand he get professional help and if he refuses make plans to get out of there.", "NTA\n\nI'd give him the boot, unless there are any positive qualities you left out that balance out his laziness, selfishness, & childishness.\n\nDepression my ass. He's using you, and he'll keep using you as long as you allow it.", "NTA\n\nBUT: are you sure he is actually depressed?  \nBecause a depressed person would not treat you like a maid service. \n\nAnd that is what he is doing. A maid, a bedwarmer (maybe) a housekeeper.. but not an equal partner", "NTA \n\nThis does not sound like depression, but your fianc\u00e9 being a manipulative AH who is taking advantage of a situation.", "NTA. \u201cA roach in my ear\u201d!!!!!!", "NTA but you are maid-mommy to an adult child.  \n\nSome unsolicited advice: Apply for rent, food, and daycare assistance and get the heck outta there. \n\nDon't let this person drown you anymore. You don't deserve to struggle this much or work so hard for someone elses individual success and y'all can get back together later once he grows up if that's what you both really want.", "This. I\u2019ve dated people who have been depressed before, and even fallen into the caretaker role, but they were never demanding that I do anything for them. It was more of a lack of will to do anything for themselves, so I would do it for them to make sure it got done. Example being, they hadn\u2019t eaten all day, so I would make them food. They never demanded or even really asked me to make them food, but I was aware they needed to eat. \n\nI don\u2019t know a lot about depression, but it sounds like there may be more to it than just that.", "This right here. Seems like he has no interest in being self sufficient but has become comfortable with what you do for him. \n \n\u201cAllowed to be depressed\u201d? It seems like your very understanding to his mental health, and very patient and kind. He needs to be working on himself, it is not on you to have the weight of his issues all on you if he isn\u2019t even trying.\n\nI say this as a person with severe depression and with a long-term partner who I constantly strive to be better for.", "He does have a history of it. But if I bring up anything about how he's being controlling or anything to that capacity, he says I'm being toxic.", "I'm starting to consider going back to not being together.", "I think she fell asleep while he was driving and she was the \"support passenger\".", "Or he eats \ud83d\ude40 like he's starving lol", "I don't get what the big deal is or why people are so obsessed with big Dicks? How in the actual F.U.C.K can that even feel good!? That sounds painful as F! Like no. I've tried 8 many times and cried. Like just no. I can't wrap my head around that even if I tried.", "I promise it's nothing close to that. We're just high school sweethearts.", "His mom coddled the hell out of him. Like he stabbed his sister when they were kids and they pushed it under the rug. He use to be on top of his money when we were younger but his family doesn't reprimand him for not paying rent on time. (Yes, we live with his family)", "Nothing! He hasn't done anything nice for me in months. But I've taken him on several outings and done nice things for him at home. So there's nothing romantic going.", "Okay, that kind of accusation is exactly what controlling abusive people do. they turn it all around so everything is your fault, not theirs, and they accuse you of all the behaviors they engage in (being controlling, cheating, being toxic). Do you have other people in the real world you can talk to right now? We're just a bunch of strangers on a message board, but this sounds very unhealthy and you need the support of others. If nothing else, you driving with so little sleep every night is deeply dangerous to you/anyone else in the car with you. I haven't asked where your child is when you are driving your partner, but i hope he is somewhere safe.", "I've fall asleep driving often but this time I got to sleep while he was driving.", "Time to grow up babe. Ur partner hasn\u2019t and has proven to be a vampire; he\u2019ll suck u dry if u let him. NTA", "NTA - Your perspective and examples sound solid. Sorry you are going through this. The biggest impact to change behavior is consequences; there are positive and negative types. Access your support system and if therapy interest you, go; a place to receive unbiased support, learn new skills, explore your frustration and hurt and your options. Best to you.", "He's safe. He stays at home with his grandmother. She's a big help.", "I am so glad to hear that. You deserve to be safe too. I don't think your partner has your best interests in mind."]}
