We have an 80 pound dog who loves her yard and loves to play. My husband's dad and step-mom (FIL 75, MIL 68) moved to live 10 minutes away from us.\n\nFIL's new thing is bringing their two dogs, a Berner and a rescue, over to our house without asking. If FIL has to stop by briefly, he'll bring his dogs in through the back gate and let them into our backyard before coming inside. He does this when I'm not home to say no, and my husband doesn't feel like he can say no after the dogs are already in the yard. \n\nTheir two dogs are not trained, particularly the Berner who is 3 years old, not neutered, and a rampaging idiot of a dog. The Berner tries to incessantly hump our female (spayed) dog. They end up wrestling a lot, which leaves them filthy. The in-laws can't take their dogs to a dog park right now for exercise because of the Berner not being neutered (they are supposed to be scheduling his procedure), so they are using our yard as the substitute dog park without clearing it with us.\n\nLast Friday was a repeat of this event. I came home from picking up kiddo after work to my husband saying his dad had brought their dogs over earlier. Our dog was covered in mud and dog spit. I nearly cried I was so upset at how dirty she was. For context, I'm 8 months pregnant, and we had guests coming to stay the next day for which I already had a cleaning plan in place for Friday and Saturday morning to get it all done without overwhelming me or hubby. Instead, we had to take 1.5 hours on Friday to bathe and blow-dry the dog.\n\nI decided to text FIL and MIL: \"I know the dogs aren't going to the dog park now and need space to run around, but it's not convenient for them to visit without asking ahead of time...\" and explained how dirty our dog was. They have ignored my text. Instead, when they picked up kiddo for grandparents time on Sunday, they laid into my husband about how A. They did nothing my wrong, B. It's inappropriate I told them they can't continue bringing the dogs over without asking. They lectured him for ten minutes while I was elsewhere.\n\nUsually we have a good relationship with them, so the fact they are refusing to respond to me but lectured my husband is aggravating. I don't know if a follow-up apology for my tone is needed to cool the relationship, or if I just need to leave this boundary in place without question.\n\nAITA for telling them that our yard is not their dog park?", "created_utc": 1680007221, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124ni6g/aita_for_telling_inlaws_they_cant_use_our/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is your property and you have the right to set boundaries. Your in-laws should have asked for permission before bringing their dogs over, and their dogs' behavior is causing problems for your dog. It's understandable that you would be upset about the extra work and stress this is causing, especially given that you are 8 months pregnant.

Your husband needs to back you up.", "NTA, but your husband is. I do feel like your inlaws are likely in a little over their heads, with their ages coupled with the rambunctious dogs. My mum adopted a 3 year old dog who was very docile at the meet and greet,  only to discover the dog had endless energy,  etc., and couldn't bring herself to rehome the dog again. The inlaws were probably relieved to have a 'safe place' for their dogs to go,  not thinking through the rest. Like other people,  I'm puzzled why your husband didn't step up or bathe your dog himself. I do hope the relationship with the inlaws can be salvaged, as I'm sure it would be nice to have a bit of help when your little one arrives... or maybe this little bit of distance was perfect timing,  so you can settle in with baby without too much meddling? \ud83d\ude09", "NTA..... obviously.\n\nI haven't yet understood one thing... and that is... by now you ILs have clearly understood the problem..  and still they resort to bringing their dogs to your house.\nEspecially with you being 8 months pregnant and all!", "NTA. You are right to create the boundary.  I don't know your tone with them when stating it but if this worries you then invite them over for tea and biscuits or coffee and pie and bring it up.  I do hope your husband told them to keep the boundary in place.  If he did, I would not worry at all about bringing it up.", "NTA You are not obligated to give anyone access to your property beyond the sidewalk out front. They have been using you and your husband out of convenience because they cannot do the responsible thing with their own pet. Something they are likely avoiding because they have your back yard as a stand-in for the dog park. Your text sounds more kind than they deserved, but I know you have to keep in mind that they are family. Your husband needs to stand up to his parents instead of leaving it to you because \"10 minutes\" is not a lecture, 10 minutes is complaining.", "NTA. If your in laws can\u2019t respect your very reasonable boundaries then perhaps they shouldn\u2019t visit at your home at all anymore. \n\nLock the gate on your fence so they cannot access your yard without coming through your house. They clearly feel entitled to your property and will continue to use it otherwise.", "NTA, but why isn\u2019t your husband dealing with his own parents?

They are taking advantage and bullying your husband. \n\nAnd kudos for explaining your boundary in a reasonable and adult manner. \n(Not wanting to sound patronizing but too many ppl on this sub have an emotional outburst to a situation like this then expect Reddit to defend the overreaction.)", "NTA.

Their even bigger a holes by thinking you have no say in whats done around YOUR house. Several things, hubby can grow a stronger set and lay down the law about no permission no dogs. He can get a lock/ latch that is placed low on the inside of the gate that dad can't get to and open said gate. Third, if hubby doesn't take care of his entitled dad then step up and cancel grandparents Sunday and tell them this  is what's going to happen each time the dogs are found in the back yard. Your 1/2 the house owner, be forceful!! Throw YOUR weight around to get results ( hell blame it on hormones, lol).", "Wow. They think it's inappropriate that you asked them not to bring their dogs to YOUR house without permission? You are definitely NTA, but they sure are.", "No apology and keep the boundaries up. If they break it. Simply say next time you do this we WILL call animal control on your pets and will put tou in time out from seeing kids. \n\nMy thing is this. If they will do this. What will they so with your kids without telling or asking you? If they cannot respect ypur boundaries with that then they won't respect them or you and hubby with others", "NTA. \n\"It's inappropriate I told them they can't continue bringing the dogs over without asking.\"\nThey already walking all over you, you need to stand firm otherwise it would get even worse. They seem to think they have a right over your house, do what you need to do to keep your boundaries before you find them living in your house and ordering you around. Put a lock, put cameras, warned them if they keep this up you'll accused them with trespassing. Be firm and don't dare to apologize,", "NTA. No apology needed.  What your ILs are doing is intrusive and rude. Your husband knew of your displeasure with their behavior and did nothing.  You had to act and I don't think your tone was out of line.  \n\nYou need to talk with your husband and insist that he set boundaries with his parents or you will.  It's your home as much as yours.  They are cowards for not responding to you, but going to your husband.  You're about to have a new infant. Untrained large dogs and infants can be a bad combination.  Stick to your guns. \n\nOh, and best wishes for the new baby.", "They're wrong, tell them they aren't allowed to meet the baby until they apologize", "NTA.\n\n> It's inappropriate I told them they can't continue bringing the dogs over without asking.\n\nThe entitlement is astounding. We live close to my parents who have a large yard and love dogs. We still ask if we can bring the dogs.", "NTA my yard is basically a dog park but the neighbors text me before they let their beasts loose in the yard.", "Thanks! We've thought about a lock and may have to do it.", "It's been a thought for other reasons, maybe we will have to for this scenario!", "Thank you! I don't think they keep my pregnancy in mind because I've thankfully had a very easy time and haven't had to adjust much yet, so they forget that it's still a thing. I couldn't even bend over to help wash the dog, so hubby was wrangling her himself!\n\nThe funny thing is, all their kids have banned these dogs from visiting their houses. We were the last to tolerate it at all, and I am close to a full ban, too. Hubby is on board.", "Hubby is in full agreement with me, and he's enforcing this as a boundary, it was just not one he felt comfortable putting in place on his own. His parents helped him a lot with his daughter when she was born and he still feels like he can't tell them no.", "Hubby has unfortunately never felt like he can enforce boundaries on them because they helped him so much with his daughter (kiddo, my step-daughter) when she was born, and he feels like he owes them to give in. He'll support me when I put in a boundary, but it's definitely why they do this shit when I'm not home. If I'm home and FIL brought the dogs in his car, the dogs stay in his car without comment and FIL picks up what he needed and leaves.", "Good for you setting boundaries with your invasive mother!  It\u2019s amazing how some people feel entitled some people feel.", "Haha, too much meddling... If only!\n\nThey bought the Berner as a puppy because they were sad their other Berner had passed. Everyone had warned them getting another large dog was a bad idea, because the last one wasn't well-trained but was tolerable, and they were then less able to train a puppy when they got the new one. They can't walk him because he's so bad on the leash. The second dog is a 100 pound Great Pyrenees they got because they'd signed up to foster dogs before they decided on the puppy... Then didn't retract their application even after they already had the puppy, and decided to adopt the Pyrenees outright. So they have a huge, terrified, dog that they don't have time or inclination to train or rehabilitate. He's actually fine, he doesn't wrestle our dog or tear up our yard, but he would pee in fright if let into our house.\n\nMy hubby did the dog bathing himself, I didn't help, but I did stay in the bathroom with them to help with handing shampoo and towels so I at least felt involved. It took the 1.5 hours because we also have to blow-dry her (which I could do without trouble, since I could sit cross -legged without bending) since she'll get matted otherwise. It was just all time we could've used elsewhere.", "They are not the most self-aware!", "Yes, hubby is supporting the boundary. They're also upset with us due to other factors - namely, we didn't clear our baby shower date with them, and MIL is traveling for the first time in years that weekend and can't attend. So they are being very salty in general right now!", "It's funny, because they only started doing this after they moved close by. When they lived thirty minutes away they never brought the dogs. So they definitely just see this as the more convenient option, with the least amount of bother to themselves.", "Hubby feels like he owes them for help in the past. He spent time as the \"screw-up\" of the family and feels guilty for how difficult he was as a kid/young adult (severe ADHD).\n\n I've been establishing boundaries for years, particularly concerning kiddo, and he's much happier to have those established. When hubby tries to set a boundary on his own, he's too quick to get frustrated, so we prefer that I'm involved so that it goes more smoothly. His parents always get grumpy but usually come around eventually.", "Thanks! That's why I try to be the one to articulate the boundary. Hubby gets frustrated and blurts out something less diplomatic!", "He does! He'll back me completely. Until Friday we hadn't set this boundary so he wasn't not supporting me previously.", "I have no idea why they phrased it as \"inappropriate\" to set the boundary! They aren't stupid, they know we both set rules for our house. I think they said it that way because they think it's inappropriate I'm \"accusing\" them of doing something wrong, when they clearly think it's fine to bring the dogs over without asking.", "If my in laws ignored my text setting a reasonable boundary and yelled at my husband for it, they would banned from coming over as well as the dogs.", "It's understandable that your husband feels indebted to his parents for helping with his daughter, but it's important for him to recognize that this does not give them the right to disregard your boundaries and use your property as their personal dog park. It may be helpful for the two of you to have a conversation about how to approach this issue with his parents, perhaps by setting clear and firm boundaries and consequences for crossing them. It's important for both of you to be on the same page and to present a united front to his parents.", "Ah, I feel for you. I have 4 large dogs,  and that's a handful with no pregnancy to factor in. We did have my mum's dog for a week while she went on a trip.  When she told me of another trip at a later date,  I said that her devil dog wasn't welcome back (not just high energy,  but terrorized my dogs), but that I'd split the kenneling costs with my sister as a mothers day gift. I feel for you. Sounds like a pack of aholes that you've got on your hands!!", "You can set the boundary, but he should be the one to enforce it with his parents. If you have to be the bad guy every time, it makes for a very tense, antagonistic relationship between you and the in laws.", "Get him to speak to them directly & tell them you're not being unreasonable & he feels the same. I got the impression from your post that he agreed with you but didn't say anything to them. Sorry for my misunderstanding. \n\nDefinitely no apology needed by you. Hopefully, once your baby is born, things will smooth with them. Good luck OP & get as much rest as you can now.", "I don't think we'll go that far, but the dogs are definitely only coming over if permission is given. They can fuss all they want.", "Thanks for the advice!", "The siblings are pooling together to board the dogs at a training kennel during FIL's recovery from an upcoming my surgery. Hopefully the trainer can get the dogs to be at least passable house guests!", "Don\u2019t ban them permanently, but temporarily to send a message.  You need your hubby to call them out and set a boundary for both of you.   Easy one is simply - until Berner is neutered the dogs aren\u2019t allowed over.", "Even neutering may not stop the humping behavior, often untrained dogs will hump when over stimulated because they don't have the training to know that is unacceptable behavior - but getting him fixed solves the he can't go to public dog parks issue.", "Ohh it\u2019s more that I don\u2019t think they will get the dog neutered (already 3), meaning the dogs don\u2019t come over.   And as you said if they do actually go forward with it, then it solves two issues, they can go to a dog park and hopefully the humping slows down."]}
