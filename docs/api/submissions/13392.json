Like other people,  I'm puzzled why your husband didn't step up or bathe your dog himself. I do hope the relationship with the inlaws can be salvaged, as I'm sure it would be nice to have a bit of help when your little one arrives... or maybe this little bit of distance was perfect timing,  so you can settle in with baby without too much meddling? \ud83d\ude09", "NTA..... obviously.\n\nI haven't yet understood one thing... and that is... by now you ILs have clearly understood the problem..  and still they resort to bringing their dogs to your house.\nEspecially with you being 8 months pregnant and all!", "NTA.

What your ILs are doing is intrusive and rude. Your husband knew of your displeasure with their behavior and did nothing.  You had to act and I don't think your tone was out of line.  \n\nYou need to talk with your husband and insist that he set boundaries with his parents or you will.  It's your home as much as yours.

We've thought about a lock and may have to do it.", "It's been a thought for other reasons, maybe we will have to for this scenario!", "Thank you! I don't think they keep my pregnancy in mind because I've thankfully had a very easy time and haven't had to adjust much yet, so they forget that it's still a thing. I couldn't even bend over to help wash the dog, so hubby was wrangling her himself!\n\nThe funny thing is, all their kids have banned these dogs from visiting their houses. We were the last to tolerate it at all, and I am close to a full ban, too. Hubby is on board.", "Hubby is in full agreement with me, and he's enforcing this as a boundary, it was just not one he felt comfortable putting in place on his own. His parents helped him a lot with his daughter when she was born and he still feels like he can't tell them no.", "Hubby has unfortunately never felt like he can enforce boundaries on them because they helped him so much with his daughter (kiddo, my step-daughter) when she was born, and he feels like he owes them to give in. He'll support me when I put in a boundary, but it's definitely why they do this shit when I'm not home. If I'm home and FIL brought the dogs in his car, the dogs stay in his car without comment and FIL picks up what he needed and leaves.", "Good for you setting boundaries with your invasive mother!  It\u2019s amazing how some people feel entitled some people feel.", "Haha, too much meddling... If only!\n\nThey bought the Berner as a puppy because they were sad their other Berner had passed. Everyone had warned them getting another large dog was a bad idea, because the last one wasn't well-trained but was tolerable, and they were then less able to train a puppy when they got the new one. They can't walk him because he's so bad on the leash. The second dog is a 100 pound Great Pyrenees they got because they'd signed up to foster dogs before they decided on the puppy... Then didn't retract their application even after they already had the puppy, and decided to adopt the Pyrenees outright. So they have a huge, terrified, dog that they don't have time or inclination to train or rehabilitate. He's actually fine, he doesn't wrestle our dog or tear up our yard, but he would pee in fright if let into our house.\n\nMy hubby did the dog bathing himself, I didn't help, but I did stay in the bathroom with them to help with handing shampoo and towels so I at least felt involved. It took the 1.5 hours because we also have to blow-dry her (which I could do without trouble, since I could sit cross -legged without bending) since she'll get matted otherwise. It was just all time we could've used elsewhere.", "They are not the most self-aware!", "Yes, hubby is supporting the boundary. They're also upset with us due to other factors - namely, we didn't clear our baby shower date with them, and MIL is traveling for the first time in years that weekend and can't attend. So they are being very salty in general right now!", "It's funny, because they only started doing this after they moved close by. When they lived thirty minutes away they never brought the dogs. So they definitely just see this as the more convenient option, with the least amount of bother to themselves.", "Hubby feels like he owes them for help in the past. He spent time as the \"screw-up\" of the family and feels guilty for how difficult he was as a kid/young adult (severe ADHD).\n\n I've been establishing boundaries for years, particularly concerning kiddo, and he's much happier to have those established. When hubby tries to set a boundary on his own, he's too quick to get frustrated, so we prefer that I'm involved so that it goes more smoothly. His parents always get grumpy but usually come around eventually.", "Thanks! That's why I try to be the one to articulate the boundary. Hubby gets frustrated and blurts out something less diplomatic!", "He does! He'll back me completely. Until Friday we hadn't set this boundary so he wasn't not supporting me previously.", "I have no idea why they phrased it as \"inappropriate\" to set the boundary! They aren't stupid, they know we both set rules for our house. I think they said it that way because they think it's inappropriate I'm \"accusing\" them of doing something wrong, when they clearly think it's fine to bring the dogs over without asking.", "If my in laws ignored my text setting a reasonable boundary and yelled at my husband for it, they would banned from coming over as well as the dogs.", "It's understandable that your husband feels indebted to his parents for helping with his daughter, but it's important for him to recognize that this does not give them the right to disregard your boundaries and use your property as their personal dog park. It may be helpful for the two of you to have a conversation about how to approach this issue with his parents, perhaps by setting clear and firm boundaries and consequences for crossing them. It's important for both of you to be on the same page and to present a united front to his parents.", "Ah, I feel for you. I have 4 large dogs,  and that's a handful with no pregnancy to factor in. We did have my mum's dog for a week while she went on a trip.  When she told me of another trip at a later date,  I said that her devil dog wasn't welcome back (not just high energy,  but terrorized my dogs), but that I'd split the kenneling costs with my sister as a mothers day gift. I feel for you. Sounds like a pack of aholes that you've got on your hands!!", "You can set the boundary, but he should be the one to enforce it with his parents. If you have to be the bad guy every time, it makes for a very tense, antagonistic relationship between you and the in laws.", "Get him to speak to them directly & tell them you're not being unreasonable & he feels the same. I got the impression from your post that he agreed with you but didn't say anything to them. Sorry for my misunderstanding. \n\nDefinitely no apology needed by you. Hopefully, once your baby is born, things will smooth with them. Good luck OP & get as much rest as you can now.", "I don't think we'll go that far, but the dogs are definitely only coming over if permission is given. They can fuss all they want.", "Thanks for the advice!", "The siblings are pooling together to board the dogs at a training kennel during FIL's recovery from an upcoming my surgery. Hopefully the trainer can get the dogs to be at least passable house guests!", "Don\u2019t ban them permanently, but temporarily to send a message.  You need your hubby to call them out and set a boundary for both of you.   Easy one is simply - until Berner is neutered the dogs aren\u2019t allowed over.", "Even neutering may not stop the humping behavior, often untrained dogs will hump when over stimulated because they don't have the training to know that is unacceptable behavior - but getting him fixed solves the he can't go to public dog parks issue.", "Ohh it\u2019s more that I don\u2019t think they will get the dog neutered (already 3), meaning the dogs don\u2019t come over.   And as you said if they do actually go forward with it, then it solves two issues, they can go to a dog park and hopefully the humping slows down.", "Your husband needs to back you up, unequivocally and quickly.\n\nAnd your IL's need to recognize that continued grandparent time is contingent upon acknowledging and respecting boundaries, whether regarding people or pets.\n\nOh, and you need to put a lock on the gate.  Whether or not husband gets the combination is dependent on his agreement not to share it with the IL's.\n\nYour mistake her was texting the IL's without including the hubs on the text.
