Good for you.\n\nBut unfortunately you married an asshole.\n\nThere is no such thing as a \"bridal hairstyle\" and she was just asserting dominance over your mother. Kicking her out of the wedding will not be recoverable.", "I could add a comment,  but this is just too perfectly on point.   Good luck in that marriage dude.", "The mom deserved better. Some pearls were not worth altering the entire relationship with your mother in law and especially not to cause irreparable damage to between your now husband and his mom.", "This idea that you should always stand with your wife is crazy. People can be wrong and I don\u2019t have to agree with everything you do especially if it is disrespectful to my family.", "Upstaged by... hair?\n\nSo your wife would rather have your mom ruin her hairstyle, because your wife thought no one else should be able to wear pearls but the bride.  Was the bride wearing pearls in her hair?  (I'm going to go out on a limb and guess no.)\n\nYour wife reminds me of a toddler who gets mad any time another kid is playing with a toy, even if they're playing with their *own* toy and even if they had no interest in the toy before they saw it being used."]}
