It's not just set on so it could be taken out easily without wrecking the rest of it. And his wife was being ridiculous and I doubt this is the first similar power move she's played.", "Ah but usually when they defend their mother they get called YTA for being a Momma's boy and not defending the wife.\n\nSometimes the man can just do no right. Damned if you do, damned if you don't", "Why did you choose to marry somebody so insecure that they\u2019re threatened by your mom\u2019s perfectly normal wedding hairstyle? Oof.\n\nYTA, btw.", "True. But regardless if your at the wedding and the bride and groom have a dress code/a problem with your outfit, then just change. It\u2019s considered rude not to, even if the bride and groom are asses about it.", "Guess they were in this case", "She just doesn't want to speak English in her house", "no", "Interesting because my North African mother put her husband before everything.", "Can you blame her though when you clearly would choose any partner over her, even if they are in the wrong? Also, in Arab cultures, mothers of the bride and groom and their sisters are expected to go all out. And your wife went crazy for a few fake pearls in her hair!", "Heads up - your Mother\u2019s behavior and hairstyle were not attention seeking. Your wife has gone off the deep end with this one. Pearls are, in fact, the *recommended* jewelry for bridesmaids, mothers of the bride/groom, etc. Pearls supposedly represent the bride\u2019s tears and by wearing them at the ceremony, people are \u201ccapturing\u201d the tears and ensuring that the bride will have a joyful, tearless wedding and life.\n\nYour wife acted atrociously here and you severed your relationship with your Mom over it. This does not bode well for your future.", "OP, I agree that race is irrelevant here, but I think people were trying to understand if culture could have been a factor in this strange position from your wife. In case you haven't gotten the message already, YTA and you and your wife should apologise to your mum. Blame it on wedding stress.", "I was 12 when she met him, she couldn't have possibly predicted this. He even told her she needed to tone it down as she was isolating her kids", "Blame it on wedding stress and hope everyone can move on. If my son did this to me, my heart would be completely broken.", "I admit I was harsh with my statement. I don\u2019t know what kind of a relationship you have with your mother but what happened surely will worsen it."]}
