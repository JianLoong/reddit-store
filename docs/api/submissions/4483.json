OP is 100% YTA...the conversation never should have happened, there should have been an adult conversation between the spouses with husband getting his wife in check. However, having had a marriage with a subtly intentionally antagonistic MIL, I have to project myself into the role of mother of the bride. What's my motivation? I obviously want to see my son get married no? So if a strand of pearls in my hair is causing that much ridiculous drama, I'd probably take them out and then just loathe my DIL for eternity. The mother (and father!) willingly leaving the wedding so easily suggests that there's more going on here than has been told in this post.
