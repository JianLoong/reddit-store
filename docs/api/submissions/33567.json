CLEANING SUPPLIES/MAINTENANCE MATERIALS ARE. NOT. GIFTS. it\u2019s a complete asshole move to try and pass of a necessity as a personal present. As you said, getting it for the entire house as a family Yule present is a good idea. But what he did was plain ignorant disrespect", "NTA, that\u2019s a great family gift. Many years my husband and I gave ourselves a \u201cteam gift\u201d of something big for the house and we would get a smaller personal gift for each other and fill the stockings.\n\nIt\u2019s a great way to get something necessary without blowing our budget. The gift he got is a team gift, not an individual one.", "NAH\n\nI understand where you\u2019re coming from, but I also understand why he thought it would be a good gift. You saw it and said \u201cI want this but it\u2019s too expensive.\u201d It\u2019s a household gift yes but it\u2019s also something you expressed wanting around the holidays.\n\nI would feel totally differently if he had decided out of the blue to get this, you know? \n\nBut it\u2019s also okay for you to not like it and say so and why, and okay for him to be disappointed by your reaction.", "Absolutely NTA, while his intention was good and it makes a nice gift to the *household* he really tossed himself right into AH with the sulking. Gifting someone an appliance without them *explicitly* requesting it as a gift for that occasion is tactless and pretty insulting but for a first offense I can give the benefit of the doubt on ignorance but nah, he outta line", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019d love something like that as a gift, myself, but I\u2019m also not living in a situation where my position as an equal partner in the household chores is being threatened. My husband got a snowblower for Christmas last year. He is not the only one who snowblows the driveway. The year before that, I got a stick vacuum. Hubby uses it more than I do. I consider me not having to do all of the vacuuming because hubby likes to use the new one to be part of the present. \n\nBut all that said, that\u2019s me. Everybody has different tastes and different expectations for gifts. A good gift giver should try to understand those expectations, especially if the intended recipient is a household member. You are not TA at all for being disappointed.", "NAH.\n\nYour husband didn\u2019t think about the full ramifications of the gift idea but I think his heart was in the right place.\n\nYou are absolutely correct that it should have been a household purchase, not a gift for you.", "I don't know what a scrub daddy is, but I think I want one.\n\nI can't tell if YTA. Depends on how you told him. He perhaps meant well, but got it wrong, though still needed to understand why it wasn't the most appropriate gift. There's ways of doing this. Even if you didn't get angry, did you punish him with words and actions, tell him patronizingly, not acknowledge his intentions, etc.? YTA.  He may have spent time researching this thing, agonizing over spending the money, then hoping it would please you. You've just shot down his expression of love, however misguided.\n\nOr get over your initial reaction and give him a bit of acknowledgment and kindness while still getting your point across. E.g. be the bigger person, and perhaps try saying something like: honey, I know you meant well. You went to a lot of trouble and expense to get something you thought would please me. And I will be pleased if this cleaning bad boy is a gift for the household. It's just that it suggests a role defining me in service to the household. It hurts a bit because sometimes it's stressful just to keep up with maintaining the household. I was just hoping that you might give me a gift that is just for me, and makes me feel a little bit special and cared for. Since you've already spent this money on this amazing device, it doesn't have to be expensive, but I would appreciate a little something that makes me feel loved for more than my cleaning badassery. Thanks, I do love you. In my opinion, that might be a mostly NTA followup to your initial reaction.", "NTA. Buying you specifically (not the household, not 'for both of us', just you) a cleaning device for your personal present is your husband essentially treating you as housekeeping first, spouse second.   \nFrom what I've read you were much more reasonable and restrained in your response than many other people would be after receiving such a demeaning 'gift' from their romantic partner.", "This might be unpopular, but YTA\n\nI've gotten a vacuum cleaner for a present from my parents when I moved out - I do the cleaning because I live alone. My father got my mother a vacuum cleaner for Christmas one year - she did the cleaning because he worked full-time and she was a stay-at-home wife and mother who didn't work. These were good gifts, and heck, neither of them were expensive fancy ones. They were pretty basic vacuums.\n\nYou don't work, and he does, despite also having health issues. He bought you an expensive gift that will make YOUR life easier, that you indicated you want, but now you want to complain because it's not fun enough, I guess? Show some gratitude.", "NTA. We got a great vacuum on black Friday sale and my husband made a Christmas joke about it. I told him it\u2019s cool as a joint/house Christmas but if it\u2019s my individual Christmas I\u2019d return it because I don\u2019t want a cleaning appliance as a gift, years ago I got a kitchen aid and was thrilled because I specifically asked for it. You\u2019re exactly right that the implication of a cleaning thing for your gift means that it\u2019s supposed to be you using it or that cleanliness is your responsibility. Fair to not want that at Christmas.", "NTA. \n\nUnless someone explicitly asks for it for Christmas, you should never gift a household chore related item. You deserve presents that are purely for you and bring you joy. \n\nI can understand if you don\u2019t normally have the finances for something like that then sacrifices need to be made elsewhere, but that would be a group decision. If he\u2019d suggested you both take it easy on presents this year so that you can buy the cleaner that would have been fine, but to make you miss out on presents for a household item is incredibly thoughtless of him.", "The Wall of Awful. Wow. What an awesome descriptor for my failing to start a large project. It's like someone turned a lens and it all came into focus.\n\nYes, a floor cleaner should never be an unrequested gift.\n\nNTA", "NTA. He was being dense but generous. I thought we taught men that appliances are not gifts 50 years ago?", "Nta. The only time I got a vacuum for Christmas was because I asked for it. Hadn't had one for years and was tired of sweeping carpet. This is a terrible present otherwise.", "YTA - Instead of being an ungrateful person about your husband listening to you, which by the way will probably make him listen to what you ask for less, you should have just got him a family gift as well. For example, something like a new TV for the living room, that you can both enjoy that benefits you both. \n\nAlso a little baffling how everyone can just gloss over how you claim to \u201cbe fine cleaning one cabinet a week\u201d. Sounds like you needed this gift more than you\u2019d like to admit.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
