But she\u2019s the parent of those kids so it\u2019s her call. (Still, refusing the gifts outright is hard to understand, especially if it was just about the colours? Really??)", "Well then, she is being ridiculous.", "It\u2019s really important to make sure gifts are returnable. Even for mundane reasons. . . Like when kids get duplicates (happens a lot). It\u2019s not the biggest deal. But when there\u2019s no receipt, a gift can be for naught.\n\nReally, her reasons don\u2019t matter. Maybe they are superficial or weird. Parents do all kinds of shit that\u2019s weird or questionably motivated, but not abusive by any means.\n\nThere are parents that don\u2019t want their kids using sippy cups or utensils or screen time before a certain age or no sweets or no clothes not made of natural materials or nothing commercially branded or whatever. \n\nAs a sometimes caretaker and non-immediate family member as long as it\u2019s not abusive, you have no say. That\u2019s just a fact.\n\nRespect the decision and move on.\n\nYou can privately think it\u2019s stupid, but trust me. Your relationship with your sister and, maybe more importantly, your nieces and nephews will be better for it.", "Which is why I said that the mother sucks too. My last point was showing that there can be other reasons why gifts can be disapproved and it's not just black and white that every parent who's disagreeing with a present is immediately in the wrong.", "How do her kids handle that? Dont kids generally make a mess and get mad when there space is invaded?", "Once again, we \\*really\\* need a Witness Protection Program for children who are being exploited for online crap.", "I don't think sis cares if the kids like the presents.", "I hoarded stickers too. I think as an adult I can officially say that I don\u2019t see the point of stickers.", "no personality, she like the stock photo vibe", "?", "I have worked in childcare 29 years. Plus I have young adult son. These dolls are good for pretend. Play which is area that kids need. As well as enjoy. I approve and have experience. So she can tell her sister to get over it and blame me.", "Are you serious ?? Because when your kids grow up . They will be asked what they want to do for living. Since you couldn\u2019t even let them decide to wear pink ballet shoes. Safe bet they won\u2019t trust their own judgment to do it either, Not something that I was ever taught in any Child development class.", "I really appreciate that you are letting them be individuals even though you it is not to your taste. It is so important. Not a parent myself but an auntie. You sound like a loving parent. Isn't so awesome when they light up and are excited about things?", "Congrats! I hope everything goes well! Enjoy the beautiful chaos to come!", "I remember seeing a few years ago pictures of I think it was Kim Kardashian\u2019s home and it looked so bland and clinical, a showroom much more than somewhere people actually lived.", "Why make things more difficult to read for no reason?", "No. It's inappropriate to go around a parent and cause issues for the child in their own home like that.", "Not all kids. I would say probably most. When I was little my favorite color was black. I liked dark blue for a while and deep purple has always been one of my favorites. The only bright colors I liked were neon.", "Avocado green, anybody?  How about Harvest Gold???   I grew up with those.", "Thank goodness! Even though I am a millenial and we get the stereotype that we prefer the beige or gray aesthetic but not me. I miss when restaurants inside and buildings outside were unique. Like you could tell without seeing the name what building was Pizza Hut. To me all the beige and gray just seems so bland or depressing.", "There was a similar beige/eggshell epidemic in the early to mid 90s. \n\nI remember one of my best friends mom's was excited to show me the new color she painted the kitchen. It was just eggshell white but she insisted it had a hint of sage green. I remember staring at it, trying to see green.", "That is absolutely fine. I let Joshua decide too. Looking forward to when Everly. Starts doing that. My son will be fine. Her mom maybe not.", "Did you mean to respond to my comment? I was saying that I realized how damaging it is for them to not have a say in what they wear so I stopped forcing it on them when my oldest was under 2. My youngest has always had autonomy over her clothes.", "It\u2019s amazing watching them. I hate play doh because of the mess it makes but I got some for Christmas for my 3 year old because she loves it so much lol. Their joy and delight is worth some extra effort and work on my part.", "Thank you for sharing all that. You just made my Friday. I love a happy ending where you can still annoy your sibling (lovingly) and the kiddos get love from all sides. I love my niblings. I choose being auntie instead of parent. Frees me up to help parents and that parenting thing looks kinda hard to do 24/7 LOL. I love kids just figured out I don't need my own. I hope you and yours have a wonderful holiday.", "Get well soon! Happy Hanukkah!", "some subs get weird if you use that word", "I am sorry you had to go through that. Kids should be able too pick out their own clothes. Helps prepare them for deciding where they want to live. When they grow up. What classes they want to take.", "How dare you. Avocado green was and is amazing and is so going to make a comeback. Just you wait haha. \n\nAs a side note i was in a lecture theatre once with avocado green velvet chairs. And avocado green carpet...that even went up half the wall. Those chairs were so comfortable. If was hands down the best lecture theatre i have been in for comfort and just a thought that someone stood there are was pleased when they did this refit.", "Yeah, mixing the leopard with the zebra is where it gets problematic. What are you? Predator, prey, who can tell?", "That tells me you have created a happy safe home for them. Clearly you have done the parenting thing right.  I am looking forward to going to my mum's Friday. It won't be big and we are not sure what activities we will do and it is the first without dad (rest his soul) but its our happy place. Cuddled on the couch watching whatever or me watching her play her PS5 (yes you read that right LOL). Thank you for sharing the magic with the rest of us and have a great holiday.", "Love it! My mum is late sixties and plays PS5 games. It is so awesome when they love something age be damned! I love lego too. We have to get older but who said we had to grow all the way up?", "When things are fun, there's no age you have to stop doing them \u2665\ufe0f"]}
