Apparently it was a 300 dollar bottle and it cause a huge fight between her and DIL.\n\nWe let them stay until the renovations were done and they have been out two weeks ago. Relationship has been tense and I figured we just need time apart. My son met up with me and told us we can\u2019t see our grandkids anymore. That the incident made him rethink our relationship.\n\nI told him that was bullshit, the he knew the one big rule in the home, caused stress to his mother ( my wife). He told me it was final and I told him if he goes through with this he will be out of the will. \n\nThis started another argument and he is pissed at me.\n\nEdit: the wine was open. \n\nEdit 2: I called my sister, and asked her to tell me to track down the price of the wine.

The most ridiculous one was us wanting to slightly shift the angle of a laser light (Xmas decoration) to not shine in our bedroom window (which was keeping the kids up). This wasn\u2019t allowed and we resorted to sneaking to shift it so the kids could sleep. Next day, they\u2019d shift it back. It was exhausting.

Breaking the no alcohol-in-the-house rule?  Not acceptable.  They didn't treat you with the respect you deserved.  I could see my kids doing that when they were 14 (gotta rebel) but as adults, they would treat this with respect.  I treat them like adults, and in return, they behave like adults. If something meant THAT MUCH to me, and wasn't insane, they would have enough regard for me that they would comply. Without complaint.  So. Your houseguests were behaving like rebellious 14 year old kids.  It's that simple to me.  Oh, and hiding wine?  Yeah. My kids outgrew being sneaky, too.  They own what they do, like adults. \n\nNext ... Holding an inheritance hostage?  Seriously?  You have to be kidding me.  Do you have so little self respect that you need to threaten punishment that won't even happen until you're dead?  Just to register your protest?  Is your Will the only power you have?  Is your family so broken that treating each other with respect for feelings isn't likely to happen?  This isn't a \"consequence\".  It's a \"Nah Nah so there!\" punishment.  \n\n\"Consequences\" are things that are a direct result of the action.  Your will has absolutely nothing to do with seeing your children.  If you believe this needs a consequence, then find something logical, like not giving gifts to the children if you can't watch them open the gift. Logic, please.\n\nAnd conversely ... Holding your contact with grandchildren hostage is right up there with behavior of a child. Your son and DIL need to grow up. This is clearly their greatest power over you, they're mad, so they're taking their basketball home to sulk, and you don't get to play with it.\n\nNow. Looking at how ALL of you have behaved, I'm thinking that y'all need to work on the dysfunction in your family, with a professional.  \n\n... and, no, my family isn't perfect, but if there's a problem, we work it out like grown ups.", "nta. no relationship, no inheritance. if he doesn\u2019t want you in his life, he doesn\u2019t get your money either. maybe there are other reasons, as others have said, but that doesn\u2019t change it for me. no op, no op\u2019s money. can\u2019t have it both ways.", "ESH except the grandchildren. \n\nAs soon as you suspected that your rules were not being complied with and alcohol was secretly being brought into your property, you should have let your son & his wife know that they needed to find an alternative place to stay with their children while their renovations were being completed.

Then asked your son to make the arrangement to leave with his family within 24hrs. \n\nThat said, your son and his wife were wrong to stay with you when they entered with the intention of quietly flouting the 'all alcohol is banned from this property' rule. \n\nBut you and your wife sound like the parents & in-laws from hell. It's probably for the best that there is no contact with your son, his wife or their children for the forseeable future.   However the price of going NC is always that that there is no chance of those who cut off contact inheriting any cash or other assets from the people that they will do almost anything to avoid contact with.

They didn't leave all of their stuff on the street in response or call the police.  They poured out some alcohol.  The same if they threw away cigarettes or marijuana.  A relatively tame and reasonable reaction to remove something that you have forbidden in your house.  They agreed to the rule when they were allowed to stay there.  It was explained that their mother had trauma related to alcohol.  If you can't go a few weeks or months without alcohol present in your house, you're an alcoholic.

How much of a slap in the face to her is it to do that?  It's alcohol.  It's not something that you need for anything.  It's a selfish and disrespectful act to somebody that is putting themselves out for you.  Like if you let someone borrow your brand new car for a week as long as they didn't drink in it.

However, when I go out I mentally prepare myself for the fact that I might see a dog and understand that I am outside of my own \"safe space\" and there's quite a bit of mental preparation that goes into that. Yes, when I see a dog out in public, I get incredibly uneasy and do my utmost to avoid it, but I do not go up to the people and demand they remove their dogs. I'm the one who ventured out in public; it's up to me to control my triggers. \n\nLikewise with OP's wife, I'd assume.

Most people understand the difference between *your* space and a public space and the nuances therein. When I'm at home, I expect to have it be the way I need it for my comfort level and anyone who visits my home, I expect them to follow these rules.
