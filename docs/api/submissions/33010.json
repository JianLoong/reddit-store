When I was a little kid, my cousins used to make fun of me a lot because of that, and had a specific nickname for me that can be translated as \"Little Coal\". I guess the nickname by itself isn't that bad but I associate it with bad memories.\n\nI was taking my cousin's kids (6M & 8F) to get ice cream, when they started calling me that nickname. I asked them to please not call me that because it made me very sad, but they continued calling me it. I asked them two more times to not do it, but since they kept going, I called my cousin to notify her that something had come up and I couldn't take the kids to ice cream any more. \n\nI explained to them that I was dropping them off and they thought I was kidding until I got them to their house and bid goodbye. Then they started apologizing but I told them that I was hurt by them not stopping when I asked them to and went away. \n\nMy cousin called me to say that I was being immature and that now her kids were crying because their aunt was upset at them. She also said that kids this age don't understand consequence so me cancelling was just an asshole move since they wouldn't understand it was because they were calling me the nickname.\n\nAITA here? I don't have kids so I honestly didn't know what to do, I just cancelled because I really hate the nickname and felt like I would have a very bad time if they kept calling me it the entire time. I feel like I am entitled to not like them calling me it but that maybe I dealt with the situation wrong.", "created_utc": 1702569288, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ibo5l/aita_for_cancelling_my_plans_with_my_cousins_kids/", "score": 1926, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Guess they learned a lesson- if you want someone to be nice to you, and do nice things for you, you need to be nice in return.\n\nObligatory here to say I am white, but that nickname doesn\u2019t seem especially kind or nice and I can imagine, to a child, he didn\u2019t feel good either. I can completely understand why as an adult, it hurts. No one wants to be singled out by family, especially based on something as unchangeable as your skin color or appearance.", "NTA, that seems pretty racist actually.  It's wild that your cousin would teach her kids that name.  She probably doesn't want to own up with the fact that her and everyone else who calls you this has actually been a racist AH this whole time.  Shocker.\n\nThey're also 6 and 8 so they can understand not to do something after an adult asks.", "NTA, there is no lower age limit to understand actions and consequences, or that if someone is being kind to you and you treat them poorly, they won't be nice anymore. Your cousin even said the kids are crying and were profusely apologizing, not because they realized they were little d!cks but of the consequences, how is this not a lesson? \n\nAlso, let's not ignore the fact that your cousin literally taught her kids to berate and bully you using a racist nickname that she used to bully you as a kid. Did she apologize for this, or at least the past name-calling?", "NTA at all.  6 and 8 are more than old enough to learn not to call people names.\n\n\"kids this age don't understand consequence \"\n\nBS.  It sounds more like they've rarely had consequences.", "Not the asshole at all. The fact she tried gaslighting you because the \"kids are too young\" is total bs!! Kids should absolutely be taught right from wrong. Surely they know the n word is bad, right? Not really any difference as far as it's wrong and hurtful. \n\nHad that been me, I wouldn't have been the one calling you. They would've called to apologize. \n\nYou're right for creating boundaries and not rewarding bad behavior. Mom needs to step up and start parenting better before her kids become bullies or get themselves beat up.", "NTA. \n\nKids that age absolutely DO understand consequences, they just might have a parent who has never disciplined them or taught them basic manners. \n\nAt school, children that age are taught to share, to respect each other, to not hit, to not make a mess, to clean up after themselves, etc. They are also of the age where they know when they are being mean, can absolutely be taught what is mean or unkind, and can understand that if they do X, Y will happen. \n\nYou asked them to stop, you explained it hurt your feelings, they are upset because they didn't listen. You did nothing wrong here. And by the way, you realize they know this nickname because your cousin drilled it in to them. Kids don't pick up on something like this if it was just casually said once or twice; the family these children are around either use this name for you A LOT or told the kids specifically to use it. The latter sounds right, and while I feel terrible if your cousin told her children to call you that and now they are upset and confused, that is on your cousin, not you.", "NTA. I think you behaved very maturely. You warned them several times and their behaviour didn\u2019t change, and so the visit ended.

Hmm...\n\n>so me cancelling was just an asshole move since they wouldn't understand it was because they were calling me the nickname.\n\nI wonder how they might learn that it was because they didn't stop calling you that name? It's all such a mystery. Perhaps dropping them off back at home without buying them ice cream and telling them why you were doing it? No -- that's crazy talk. It would never work.\n\nNTA\n\nThe kids weren't confused. Your adult cousin is the one who doesn't want to know about consequences.", "NTA, you were justing setting boundaries which is good. If you still went to go get ice cream with them, they would either think it wasn\u2019t a big deal or that their actions don\u2019t have consequences.

I laughed at the idea that \"kids this age don't understand consequences\" Of course they do! This is just the age where you teach them that. Sounds like these kids haven't been disciplined.\n\nAnd no wonder since yr cousin has the nerve to call YOU immature! Ha!\n\nYou are not in the wrong here. It's never too soon to teach kids not to tease other people. Otherwise they grow into hateful adults.", "NTA Children need boundaries to learn. You clearly expressed that it was hurtful and they thought that was even funnier. Your cousin and the children need to be accountable for treating you poorly and disrespecting your boundary.", "NTA.

In fact, its quite elevated of you to train them to be civil with people. NTA. And among the first things children learn in kindergarten is that our actions have consequences. A 6-year-old and an 8-year-old have typically already had some instruction in this area. \"If you aren't nice people won't want to play with you.

They deserved what they got, and hopefully will learn an important life lesson from this.", "NTA. Kids have to learn the lesson that actions have consequences.

You handled it brilliantly.", "NTA\n\nIf they don\u2019t understand consequences then it\u2019s good you taught them. You made it clear for them to stop but they kept going. Also, your cousin taught them to call you something hurtful so they need to know that yes you\u2019re upset.

What do your parents think of this???", "Mom of 3 hear, what you did was spot on, taught the kids there are consequences to saying something hurtful, their mom obviously hasn\u2018t, she is obviously okay with calling you that hurtful nickname, that\u2019s why the kids thought it was okay.", "NTA\n\nYour cousin is lying. Kids that age can and do understand consequences, why else would they start to apologise when they realised you were serious about not going. They knew that their words, and not listening to you, led to this outcome.\n\nSure, they both may not retain that information straight away for next time, but if it happens again, and you react the same way then they will learn.  \n\nThe problem here is that they have picked this up from your cousin presumably. Maybe she told them that they used to call you that as a child, not even thinking that they would parrot it, and they tried it out.

They could also do with a lesson about racism too.", "NTA.  I am getting really annoyed with all these parents excusing their children's poor behaviour because they are too young to understand. Have these parents actually tried to explain anything to their children, or do they believe that they reach a certain age and magically know how to behave?\n\nI have always spoken to my children about the best ways to behave and why. Using simplified analogies really helps get the message across. You had already explained several times to these children that being called this name made you sad, which should have been enough.

They continue to call you that racist name to your face. They are racists and they are raising racist kids. \n\nStop interacting with them.

You asked them multiple times not to call you the nickname and they persisted. Now they will learn not to call you that if they want anything from you. Also, I think it's pretty ballsy of your cousin to call you immature when SHE was the one that taught her kids the nickname in question. You want a person to treat your children kindly then don't teach your kids to say unkind things to that person.", "NTA and I was about that age when I heard the n word the first time and my mama taught me good and proper never but never to say that word.

Okay good. They should be. They were set up by their mom to be mean, they hurt their aunt's feelings badly, they ruined their own day. \n\nIf you said you'd never forgive these kids that's too far, it's not their fault they have a racist mom who spoils them, they can easily outgrow what they've done, but they aren't owed not being sad about it at the time.\n\nLike... it's obviously better for them to not be racist because it's horrible, but they at least need to learn you don't get stuff from people by hurting their feelings and continuing to do it. \"If you're mean you won't have friends and aunts don't have to take you for ice cream as you are vile\" is perfectly age appropriate.\n\nNTA\n\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n6 and 8 are plenty old enough to know that actions have consequences, and to have that explained to them.

You should be having a conversation about racism with all the adult members of your family.", "NTA. You didn't respond in some immature way like some people suggested. You provided a consequence to an awful comment after repeatedly asking them nicely to stop. What they are doing is bullying, and if someone doesn't show them a negative consequence, they are going to do it to other kids at school. You have done them a great service. Maybe they will think about it before they do it to someone else. They are at the perfect age to learn and understand that their actions are wrong. It makes me really sad that your family has treated you this way. You deserve to be loved and valued by them. Btw, I don't blame those kids at all, they learned this from their parents. The gentle lesson you gave them may save someone's life.", "NTA\n\nI would send your family a link here, but they're so far in denial about their own actions they'd just blame you for this too.

She taught her kids to call you a racist nickname, and had the audacity to blame you for being upset by it! \n\nYou handled the situation perfectly. You asked them to stop, explained that the nickname was hurtful to you, and enforced consequences when they refused to change their behavior. That is parenting 101!! \n\nYour AH cousin should take that as a lesson.

You did good parenting without even being the parent!", "NTA \u2014 I\u2019m not even going into how messed up that whole, \u201cracist nickname that I hate\u201d truly is. Even if there had been nothing associated with a name that you don\u2019t want to be called, you should be able to ask not to be called that and have that be it. \n\nAdditionally\u2014 I work with children, usually with older teens now but I have worked with younger children. You handled the situation as I would have advised had you asked in advance. Consequences, especially natural, logical and social consequences, are a fabulous teaching tool. They failed to honor your reasonable request and as a result you didn\u2019t want to spend time with them. That\u2019s what they will experience with their peers as well. It\u2019s hilarious that your cousin insists they don\u2019t understand consequences because it sounds to me like they do understand them perfectly. They don\u2019t enjoy them, which makes sense. Most of us don\u2019t enjoy reaping what we sow, when we have behaved badly. A good parent would be able to talk through this with the child and see if they can understand *your perspective* \u2014 that\u2019s something children struggle with and need help learning. \n\nThe next time you see them you can assure them that you still like and love them, that you didn\u2019t like the *choice* they made. It\u2019s important to stress that it was a choice or a behavior. Those are changeable and not intrinsic. It\u2019s a distinction that they\u2019ll appreciate. \u201cThat name hurts my feelings, and I don\u2019t like being called that.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t spend time with anyone who calls me that.\u201d \u201cPlease call me X.\u201d \n\nUnlike your AH adult cousins, the children can still learn to treat you with kindness and decency, and they\u2019ll benefit from learning in this instance. There are negative consequences to treating someone poorly, and they won\u2019t make friends or get special treats when they choose to be unkind. But they can always make better choices. Every day is a new day.", "NTA. \n\nKids learn what consequences are by experiencing them.  This was a very appropriate lesson", "NTA!!!  Their 6 & 8 year old kids are plenty old enough to learn consequences for bad behavior!!  You asked them multiple times to stop and they didn't.  They sound like brats to me.

I wouldn't go back there until they did.", "NTA!  NTA!!   NTA!!!  \nThere is absolutely no way those kids didn't understand what they were doing.

No one should be called such a racist and insulting nickname.  I'd walk away from the cousin too unless she is willing to sit down with her kids and explain to them why this is insulting and have them apologize.  Personally I think you taught them a very valuable lesson - the natural consequences of continuing to do something when someone asks you to stop is that person doesn't want to be around you any more.  My wish for you is that you realize you never have to be around anyone who talks to you like this again.  Family or not.", "Nta.

I guess the nickname by itself isn't that bad but I associate it with bad memories.\n\nI was taking my cousin's kids (6M & 8F) to get ice cream, when they started calling me that nickname. I asked them to please not call me that because it made me very sad, but they continued calling me it. I asked them two more times to not do it, but since they kept going, I called my cousin to notify her that something had come up and I couldn't take the kids to ice cream any more. \n\nI explained to them that I was dropping them off and they thought I was kidding until I got them to their house and bid goodbye. Then they started apologizing but I told them that I was hurt by them not stopping when I asked them to and went away. \n\nMy cousin called me to say that I was being immature and that now her kids were crying because their aunt was upset at them. She also said that kids this age don't understand consequence so me cancelling was just an asshole move since they wouldn't understand it was because they were calling me the nickname.\n\nAITA here? I don't have kids so I honestly didn't know what to do, I just cancelled because I really hate the nickname and felt like I would have a very bad time if they kept calling me it the entire time.

Whenever someone learned it, I'd hear \"Oh, I had a cat/dog/pony named that!\"\n\nWhen I hit 18, I said no more, & acted deaf to anyone calling me anything but my actual name.\n\nMake that announcement, stand firm, & tell your cousin that she needs to apologize for teaching her kids that nickname, then for trying to gaslight you into thinking the kids can't handle the words 'Please stop' \n\nThe kids should apologize for not stopping when you asked them, too", "NTA\u2026.doesn\u2019t matter what they were saying or doing.

More than old enough to understand that there are consequences to your actions.", "My daughter knew about hurting others feelings at 3 yo.", "And old enough parents can threaten them NOT to do it. The lil sh@ts obviously heard from their inconsiderate parents. Take some responsibility!", "Absolutely this. My 6 year old sometimes says mean things (because he sometimes gets a rise out of us) and we handle him the same way. We ask him to stop and tell him how it makes us feel, then if he keeps persisting we basically say \u201cWhen you are mean like this, it\u2019s not fun to play with you. If you want me to keep playing, I need you to be nice and apologize.\u201d\n\nHopefully OP made it clear, but also hopefully the cousin helped reinforce that if you want to do fun things with people you love you better show them love and respect.

I cringe at the thought now, but I used a racially insensitive word while we were talking one day. I had NO idea it was unkind\u2014I picked it up from my grandparents, and as far as I knew, it was an innocent adjective. \n\n\nMy friend seemed to realize I was not malicious in any way, and charitably explained there are better words to use instead.

I apologized, and never used that word again.", "Preach!!!<3", "6 and 8 are old enough to learn about consequences for behavior and respecting people's boundaries.   \n\n\nAnd their parents are well past old enough to have learned that by now.", "You did that perfectly. Oh kids don't understand the consequences?  Well now they do. Your cousins hopefully learned something too. You are probably not in the US where there are huge social consequences in moat places to being racist like your cousins.", "What I don\u2019t understand more than ANYTHING else is how your dad has allowed this to continue for so long. I\u2019m sorry he hasn\u2019t held his family accountable for this and made them stop. That\u2019s a a big F for dad", "its not that you \"don't like it\" its that they are calling you racist nicknames because they are racist and want you to feel bad for your appearance/race. honestly the only solution here is telling them \"stop being racist or i won't be around you\" - if you have children or a partner of a different race they will be subjected to this too. take care of urself first!!", "It's really a disgusting shame she had 2 kids before realizing she shouldn't make fun of someone's facial features. \n\nOp, it's hard not to throw all kinds of unkind adjectives in her direction, as she's an adult who absolutely should know better. \n\nAlso really good on the gentle parenting moment. Kids need to learn consequences and can do that without the adult losing their shit and blowing up.", "I completely agree!  It's not ok to be called a racist name.  At 6 and 8, they are old enough to be taught.  Your older cousin/s may be a lost cause.  I suggest that at the next family get together, you calmly announce that this nickname is both racist and hurtful and you will not socialize with any family members that disagree.", "They are also old enough to understand that if somebody asks you to stop, you respect that persons request.

I guarantee you THOSE two kids now understand consequences!", "This opened up a whole new world of opportunity for me this holiday season.
