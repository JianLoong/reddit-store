He proposed 8 months ago and we planned the wedding right away, I\u2019ve always had the perfect wedding plan that I\u2019ve had since I just knew that Xander was going to be the one I\u2019m going to marry, so I talked to him about it and he loved it. After a while of meetings and calls we finally got it all sorted except for the invitation letters and I brought up to him how kids are always just ruining things at weddings and asked him if I\u2019d be an asshole if I didnt want kids there and he agreed with me and so we put no kids on the invitation. My sister had my loving niece 4 years ago and that was the time that I had a miscarriage at 19 with Xander and my sister has always let me be like a second mother for her and that\u2019s how she sees me as too. So I decided to just have her there as a flower girl wearing a mini wedding dress of mine. So my wedding comes and everything was perfect during the ceremony, she did so great and did her part and just sat for the rest of the ceremony until we go to the venue where I got confronted by my husbands auntie saying \u201cwhy is that little girl here if it\u2019s a kid free wedding\u201d I told her that she\u2019s like a daughter to me and I would never not include her at anything I do. I tried to walk away multiple times away from her and She started saying \u201cwell I\u2019m a mother too so why couldn\u2019t I bring my sons\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re separating their mother from them\u201d (her sons are 6 and 8 and they\u2019re the most entitled, spoiled little boys I\u2019ve ever met) I blew up and I told her because it\u2019s my wedding and I wanted my niece to be here not her sons that\u2019s probably going to just start digging on the wedding cake even before we get to it and she would just stare and not do anything(they did that at Xander\u2019s sisters wedding and she didn\u2019t do anything about it) she started going off at me and me if I\u2019m calling her a bad mother and I said yes because she raised entitled brats that needs manners. She started calling me names and just making a big scene at the venue until Xander\u2019s uncle dragged her out. By then I was already having a panic attack as I have very bad anxiety and went to the bathroom. My husband tried to try to get me out but I just couldn\u2019t, I felt too humiliated and embarrassed to get out. And then I just hear my sister trying to get my niece to call me and I just hear her say mama are you okay( my niece calls me mama and my sister mommy) i don\u2019t know why but my anxiety always just disappears when it comes to her, I calmed down and opened the door and she just hugged me right away. My sister said i knew she was the only one that can get you out. We went out and I just tried to enjoy the last moments that\u2019s were there. \n\nNone of the other moms were upset about the kid free rule or my niece being there. They were actually glad that they get to go out without them. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t know if it was the right call to not having kids in my wedding since I it\u2019s Xander\u2019s family and I just feel like an asshole, so am I?", "created_utc": 1684395941, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13krxqd/aita_for_having_my_niece_at_my_kid_free_wedding/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's your wedding, and you have the right to decide who is invited and who isn't. If you wanted a mostly kid-free wedding but still wanted your niece there because of your special bond, that is your decision. The auntie's behavior was inappropriate, and it's understandable that you were upset. It's important to remember that your wedding day is about celebrating your love and commitment with your partner, and you shouldn't feel guilty for making decisions that reflect your preferences and values.", "NTA\n\nIt is your wedding and you can invite whoever you want and who you're most comfortable/ happy with. Your wedding (and your fiance's), your rules. \n\nCongratulations by the way!", "NTA. It's ultimately your (and your husband's) decision who gets to go. The event is literally for you so if exceptions are going to be made, it's for you. I don't think you should've escalated by calling her a bad mother though, hopefully that doesn't cause any trouble down the line. I also wasn't the one talking to her so maybe she absolutely did deserve that.", "NTA.\n\nYour wedding, your rules, even if someone disagrees with them.\n\nAs for your husband's Aunt, it's good that you called her out for her own shitty parenting.  It's bad that you did it at your own wedding; the wiser choice would have been to walk away, but it's very hard to do that in the heat of a moment like that; I understand.  \n\nCongratulations on your wedding!  Hopefully, you'll never see your husband's aunt and her two brats again after this.", "NTA. Our wedding was childfree but with a couple of exceptions for close family. At the end of the day, if anyone took issue with that they didn't have to come. \n\nAuntie chose to make a massive scene at the wedding instead of simply discussing it after the fact if she felt slighted. She was rude. Also the whole 'you're separating my children from their mum' defence is hilarious. Girl, it's one night, you'll all be fine.", "NTA.\n\nPeople like to talk about 'child-free' weddings, and it's fine if that's how you want to look at it. Bride & groom get to choose the wedding details.\n\nI look at it as 'invited guests' and 'uninvited people.' Whether those people are children or not is immaterial; if you're not invited, you're not invited. Aunty's kids were not invited, and your niece was actually part of the wedding party!\n\nAnd she's doubly an AH for harassing you on your wedding day.", "NTA and screw the lady for ruining your wedding.", "YTA So are you 23, or 18 pregnant and dying of cancer?

It's your wedding you're allowed to make exceptions.

Childfree weddings with exceptions are fine.", "NTA it's literally your wedding. Clearly your auntie is just entitled. additionally the flower girl is part of the bridal shower and most likely surrounded by people who watch her, rather than random kids who could mess up/cause a scene (which was what you specifically wanted to avoid)", "NTA.\n\nMy husband and I had a child-free wedding but made exceptions for our 4 nieces and nephews (all aged 10 and under) and included them in the wedding party as flower girls/ushers. We wanted them there, that's all there was to it. We also made an exception for my husband's cousin as her baby was tiny and too young to not be with her mum; she's family and we trusted that she would take the baby out if she started to cry during the ceremony/speeches (she didn't cry in the end).\n\nNo-one seemed to mind at all, and I think some parents were glad of a night off \ud83d\ude09 I don't think it's unusual or problematic to make exceptions for kids that are close to the couple getting married. Most people wouldn't think twice about it, unfortunately your husband's aunt just sounds like a nasty person.", "nta - i had a kid free wedding with my niece being the only exception as well - no one cared. your aunt is unhinged", "NTA\n\nIt's your and your husbands wedding. You decide on how you want to celebrate. \n\nI'm not from the US and childfree weddings seem really bit odd to me personally but I totally understand where you all come from. Kids have different needs and sometimes it's just easier to not include them. \n\nSociety has developed in a way that many kids and their parents act is if they are the center of the universe. When I was a kid you knew a wedding is not *your* special day and although you can certainly have fun you're not supposed to act up or ruin the the whole thing by misbehaving. This seems to be a request that lots of parents and their kids cannot do and that's why kids are excluded which I totally understand. \n\nAnd with your niece you totally had a feeling that she would be good and given the special bond you share it was just natural to have her there. \n\nSo really you're not an AH but your husbands aunt is for ruining your whole day. Maybe lunatic aunt free weddings should be a thing too.", "YTA but so is Aunty. Everyone else behaved fine\n\nAll you needed to say was she is here because she is like a daughter to me and Xander and I agreed she could be flower girl\n\nAunty should\u2019ve dropped it there but instead of you repeating and then walking away, you decided to attack her parenting and essentially ruin your own wedding", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are fine to make your own guest list - but you are an AH to lie to other guests predending the wedding were kid-free when it was not - it was just SOME kids not invited.", "ESH\n\nYou can't say no kids allow then make an exception. And his aunt shouldn't have made a scene.\n\nAlso, \"I would never not include her at anything I do,\" that's why some people don't go to no kids allowed weddings.", "NTA. You can have who you want.\n\n\n\nBut seriously people, these weddings limiting kids cause SO many hurt feelings is it really worth it?", "ESH\n\nYou're absolutely allowed to set your own rules for your own wedding. Its fair to have exceptions to the kid-free rule, especially for children that are in the wedding. Aunt is a piece of work, having the gall to stir shit up at a wedding, she's as spoiled and entitled as her 2 bratty kids. Its one thing to be a little miffed but keep it to yourself until after the event, but its another to pick a fight over it. Zero consideration for anyone but herself.\n\nHowever, you also handled this pretty poorly. All you had to say was that you made an exception for the flower girl. If she's being this way, just don't engage, she's there to cause trouble, and you indulged her in that. It takes two to tango, and you let the terrorists win.", "You could have easily said \u201c my niece is here because she\u2019s the flower girl\u201d instead of saying \u201c she\u2019s like a daughter to me I will never not include her with anything I do\u201d then after that you went after her kids basically showing how much you don\u2019t like them  you kinda insulted them too . She\u2019s an asshole all together but you came off as one too especially towards children who\u2019s not being raised right ESH", "YTA OP, not for having your niece there but by blowing up at your aunt. You ruined your own wedding by losing your temper where there was no need to. Just say \"my niece is an exception\" and walk away, how hard is that?", "YTA.  You can't on the one hand say you hate kids, but on the other hand invite a kid to your wedding.  That means you hate \\*specific\\* kids.  You might as well note that on your invitations.   Like...\"I hate my nephews, so they aren't invited\"\n\nYou would have been OK if you said no kids and actually HAD no kids there...", "ESH. \nYou for obvious reasons, but it sounds like your guest is seriously failing her kids if they're being raised like that, and seriously failing at being a polite guest.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
