Your description of her as childlike seems very appropriate.", "How ... like literally how are you the AH when you've told her you hated your birth name?

It's pretty disrespectful to not use the name someone goes by, or to use a previous name that that person has stopped using.\n\nSome people change surname if they get married, and most people manage to accept that change, but apparently some people get very bent out of shape when someone change their first name. It's no different than learning someone's name for the first time, it's about making the attempt and effort to learn it, and smoothly correct oneself if one ever forgets.\n\nI think your half-sister is rude for not letting it go and embracing you and the name you go by without making such a stink over it.

Well, it's not ridiculous to me.\n\nSo, yes, I would never be honored to have anyone name a child my old name and then wonder why I am upset. Any person who names their child saying I should be honored knows that is a lie. She knew it would not be an honor because she knew it would hurt and upset you.  She did it on purpose. Please watch out for her because if she is willing to hurt you this deeply, who knows what is next. \n\nI am so happy that you have found  safety and happiness in your real name. I smile every time someone asks me my name because that's who I am and that ain't her.", "NTA. Just think how she'd be, if you were trans.  Yikes.  How could she think it honors you, when you've told her, often, that you hated the name, and legally got rid of it?  Turn it back on her manipulative ass.", "I agree she\u2019s delusional, so I wouldn\u2019t call it deliberate.", "It's still the same level of disregard, even if it isn't a gendered issue.", "Miscommunication!!\n\n> she could still call me by my old name. I said no. I told her I hated that name, hated that it represented mom more than anyone and to call me by the name I use now. \n\nCan't see anyway this could be a communication problem.", "Well she knows. You are the one that doesn't have a clue.", "She got rid of it, does not want to be associated with it", "[removed]", "[removed]", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s up to you to decide what OP meant. They\u2019re the ones who know her, I\u2019m sure they know what they meant. \n\nPeople can be childlike and do thoughtless things like this without being intentionally malicious. That doesn\u2019t make the sister any less TA, but it does mean her development and reactions could be delayed\u2014hence, childlike. Childish implies a deliberate immaturity.", "Man, if the sister wanted that, she could have bothered to remember one thing about OP.", "DAMN she really needs to learn to drop it, holy fuck.", "She named the kid after her fantasy of OP hoping that the rest of the fantasy would come true. \n\nWhich is honestly a kinda disturbing level of magical thinking for someone with a small child", "That is some twisted behavior.  It\u2019s like she\u2019s trying to force you to have a tie to your old name.  And she\u2019s gaslighting you by telling you it\u2019s an honor when  it clearly is an insult.   She was well aware that you hated the name.  She\u2019s provoking you and then telling you are mean for reacting.\n\nI think minimal to no contact would be preferable with this type of relative.  She has some very unhealthy behaviors - controlling, manipulative, gaslighting, baiting, etc.  \n\nAbsolutely NTA.", "NTA. She's being gross and weird.", "NTA- Main character syndrome much?  Your \u201csister\u201d is cracked.", "NTA.", "I changed my name b/c my deadname was given to me by my abusive mother.\nI feel ya.\nNTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your name, and your sister lacks common sense for thinking you would be happy about it. \n\nIs there an SO involved here? I think you might want to see if you could enlist them to explain why it\u2019s unreasonable for you to see the name as an honour when it\u2019s a permanent reminder of your sister dismissing your feelings and ignoring your wishes.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is consistently picking at a scab and is expecting you to be happy about it.", "Not going to live the title did NOT make me think is would be the story. NTA your sister needs to get over herself.", "She\u2019s trying to pull some Lion King Rafiki shit.\n\n\u201cShe lives inside youuu!\u201d", "Honestly, it\u2019s probably as simple as OP\u2019s half-sister had grown up hearing about her sister who was named X, she romanticized the idea of having a sister, and when she finally met her sister and heard that she hates the name X and goes by Y now\u2026\n\nShe just ignores it. It\u2019s jarring, it doesn\u2019t fit in with her vision, and she fell in love with the idea of \u201cmy sister, X\u201d. She\u2019s selfish and shallow, and because she likes the name X, she doesn\u2019t understand/care why OP doesn\u2019t. OP\u2019s just being silly, by her logic, and she needs to get over it. So why wouldn\u2019t she use the name X to \u201chonor\u201d her sister? (She\u2019d probably decided that as a kid).\n\nSo yeah. Generally inconsiderate and cares more about her own romanticized fantasy of a sister than the real sister standing right in front of her.", "I don't think her sister did this out of spite was my point. But, I can see that someone else thinks she was being intentionally irritating.", "So is 3 years, for that matter. Sister clearly lacks something (compassion? common sense?)", "NTA\n\nAlso, the part about the difficulty of using your new name, it really is hard. One of my closest and longest friends came out as trans and changed her name. It has been probably 7 years now and I still think of her as her old name. It is only internal, I haven't spoken her old name for a few years now. It has been so hard to replace her old name. We have known each other from such a young age that I don't even remember learning her old name, it's as if I always knew it. Part of the difficulty is that I was gone for a few years doing my PhD, but that is similar to how often it seems like you saw your sister.\n\nAnd this is for someone I really care about and want to support them in every way I can. I know using her old name is a really bad thing to do. Even when I think about her and internally use her old name I stop and remind myself to use her new name.", "My sister once named her cat after me and I was very angry. And I like my name. \n\nAnyways, NTA. I'd go NC over this. Otherwise you'll have to hear the name you hate all the time. And then you'd have to interact with the kid. And say the name yourself. Just extract yourself from that ugly situation altogether.", "NTA\n\nJust goes to show you what happens when people don't listen", "NTA. She might have meant it as an honor, but you don't have to feel honored by it. If she truly wanted you to be honored by the baby's name, then she should have involved you in choosing the baby's name. \n\nYou don't get to choose a name someone hates then go to that person and be like, \"Tada! I did it for you!\" and expect the someone to be all smiles and grateful. I mean, I guess you could do that, but you would be an asshole for it.", "NTA.\n\nAnd this is the perfect time to cut her from your life again, but this time completely and forever.", "She needs therapy. I think she wants a good relationship with OP, and misses OP, and somehow all this affection went into the name, and now the child has to fill this gap that formed over the years? But she has a child, not a sister, and I sure hope she gives the child all the motherly love and parenting it will need.\n\nNTA at all, and it\u2019s sad she can\u2019t respect OPs wishes and feelings and is stuck so far in the past.", "NTA\n\nI know I don't speak for everyone, but deadnaming is generally one of those things that you don't do unless it's a mistake that you apologize for. It's your legal name and one you chose. It's a basic courtesy to call you your legal name.\n\nYour sister possibly has some larger issue. Maybe it's not it, but it sounds like she has some fantasy going on in her head. Nevertheless, repeatedly requesting something reasonable from someone choosing to ignore it turns into being forced to ask to be treated like a human being. I believe you've gone a bit past that.\n\nYour sister is forcing responsibility for her emotions onto you. She's choosing to be cruel to you to force and guilt you to act the way she wants.\n\nI suggest saying that the discussion is final about your name. Not up for debate or whatever she wants. Nothing is changing no matter what. If she brings it up, you put her on timeout and extend it. Someone who doesn't treat you like a human doesn't deserve you.\n\nI suggest you do it like this: First mention is a week of no contact. Second is two weeks. Third is a month.", "mte, this is nc level crap tbh. nta to OP of course.", "One does not preclude the other.", "Yeah, my mother has a necronym/deadname because she was named by her mother, who is a horrible human being, the kind of lady who hears about a miscarriage and says \"what about how I feel? I lost a grandchild!\" So my mother named herself after her grandfather, who was moderately cool. If someone calls her the old name it's very disrespectful.\n\nSame as a friend of mine who chose to name himself after his uncle and move his first name to his middle name, as the name is a cultural name from a country his family is from and is not the culture of the country we live in, and his original name, while a fine name, can be purposely misspoken by English speakers as a rude word. I think he may have some trauma but this is how he chose to cope with it. It would also be extremely disrespectful to call him his old name just because you got 'too used' to the old way.\n\nHe did tell me I could call him either but I felt it was very important to call him his chosen name, not what I felt used to calling him. It's about respecting people's identities and choices, regardless of reasons.", "I've seen the joy that using the chosen name over the dead name in a non-trans moment.\nA girl I grew up around changed her name from 'tiffany' to 'sophia'. Everyone that knows her still uses her dead name. I ran into her at the store and was like \"hey. Sophia right?\" \n\nGirl literally bounced in place while clapping saying yes. A simple act that meant the world to her.", "Possibly she is in denial. Missing missing reasons: OP changed her name because mother was awful; I don't remember mother being awful so she can't have been that awful; I remember OP by her birthname and those memories are good; changing the birthname implies it was bad, but I consider it good; OP has no good reason for changing her birthname so therefore the change is wrong, and I may do what I think is right, because OP is wrong.", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure what your sister is trying to do. Is she just refusing to believe that you hate that name? I\u2019m confused as to why she would think you would be honored by this.", "NTA you legally changed your name there for that name is not yours period.", "NTA, what a weird thing your sister is doing.", "nta", "NAH,\nShe clearly has some emotional bond involving your shared mother and that\u2019s the name that was closer to her,\n\nShe needs therapy to get over feeling like your detachment from your mother means you hate her. Sad that she thought she could sway you.", "Someone posted something [very similar](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ls1my/aita_for_telling_my_sister_our_grandma_hated_her/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) the other day. It is not an honour if that person doesn't like or go by that name, or just decides that they do not feel honoured for literally any reason at all. NTA", "Oh my god, your reaction is perfect  ( \" i don't give a fuck \" basically ) and she continue to harass you. I will not talk about the blatant disrespect of your sister.\n\nHard NTA.", "In either case they are constantly bringing up and relating a name that caused someone trauma to that person. \n\nThat's not to say no one can be named that name around OP, but to relate the name to OP is to disrespect them directly. \n\n\nNTA", "I think this more than anything."]}
