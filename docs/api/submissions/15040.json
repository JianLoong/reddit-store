But we did not exactly grow up together. I was 11 and she was 3 when we lived separately with our respective dad's.

When we met back up she was sad I had changed my name and asked if she could still call me by my old name. I said no. I told her I hated that name, hated that it represented mom more than anyone and to call me by the name I use now. Took her a while to use the right one and I can't say in total honesty she uses it all the time. She probably uses the old one behind my back.\n\nShe's now 23 and had a baby girl in February. She named her my original name and announced to the world that she had named her after me and wanted to honor me in her name because I was her only sibling and she wanted us to be in each other's lives forever now that we had each other back. This was how I learned about it. I didn't respond to it. She then called and asked me what I thought and I told her I didn't consider it an honor for me and would just see it as she loved the name. She was very upset. Brought it up a few times. But I didn't want to engage more in it. She chose a name. I am not honored she chose the name or considered me when she named her daughter.\n\nThe other day she told me we need to discuss this and how could I not be super touched that she named her daughter after me. I told her she used a name I hated and got rid of as soon as I was able and did not go by. I told her that was no honor to me when she named her daughter. I told her it was because she liked the name and it was one she had some emotional connection for but I would never be touched she chose THAT name.\n\nMy sister told me I was being mean and that's the name everyone knew me by longest.

She also obviously cannot dictate how YOU feel about a name. She sounds dangerously delusional. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, is she a bit slow or just dense?", "NTA. Very similar to someone calling an individual by their dead name. I realize this instance doesn\u2019t involve misgendering, but similar.", "NTA\n\nShe knew for a LONG TIME how much you hate that name and why. Indeed she knew that you hated it so much that you changed your name to something else!\n\nHow can using that name possibly be an honour to you?\n\nThat's delusional thinking!\n\nShe can use the name because she likes it, but insisting she's doing You an honour by using what is effectively your deadname, is weird, controlling and deliberate arseholery.", "NTA\n\nYou get to determine who you are, and you get to determine what matters to you.\n\nYour sister is being obnoxiously assertive, refusing to acknowledge that dynamic.", "NTA. Your sister is definitely trying to capture some essence of the family you guys never had. \n\nIn my opinion she's trying to create a fantasy where you're close sisters, you don't hate your mother, and your terrible past will be replaced by a false history where everything was great and you have no reason to change your name. Your description of her as childlike seems very appropriate.", "How ... like literally how are you the AH when you've told her you hated your birth name? That's like transitioning genders and someone honouring you for your birth gender.\n\nIt does not work like that. It's not an honour, its an insult, and too bad for the kid, but your sister poisoned your rlship with her.\n\nMaybe it's a weird way of reliving her hopes of having you in her life as her sister, now played out by her kid. \n\nNTA and good luck, your sister sounds a little obsessed.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t have been so nice about it. She is actively and purposefully triggering your trauma and expects you to be \u201chonored\u201d - I would have gone straight to No Contact and she can have fun explaining to everyone why I wanted nothing to do with her anymore. The level of disrespect is too damn high.", "NTA.  Why would someone who hated their original name be happy that it's being perpetuated?  Your half sister is lacking in critical thinking and/or listening skills.", "NTA, you have been very clear on what your name is, and that's that. It's pretty disrespectful to not use the name someone goes by, or to use a previous name that that person has stopped using.\n\nSome people change surname if they get married, and most people manage to accept that change, but apparently some people get very bent out of shape when someone change their first name. It's no different than learning someone's name for the first time, it's about making the attempt and effort to learn it, and smoothly correct oneself if one ever forgets.\n\nI think your half-sister is rude for not letting it go and embracing you and the name you go by without making such a stink over it. And I think you are right to hold your ground and set down this firm boundary. Respecting boundaries is a good sign of a healthy relationship, she should get on that.", "NTA and your half sister needs a reality check. She seems entitled and selfish.", "NTA.\n\nShe's not mature enough to be a parent, but I guess it's too late for that.\n\nYikes, \"honoring\" you by using a dead name....and then having the nerve to be offended that you didn't like it? Ugh.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a bit like someone who insists on deadnaming someone.  Your sister is in the wrong here.", "NTA.  Not knowing the situation fully, it seems like she used your old name for her child as an F You to you.", "NTA. This whole thing is weird. Maybe I\u2019m not close enough to my sister, but I would never dream of naming my kid after my alive and well sister. The kid deserves its own new name, not to be held up to some weird standard your sister created in her mind about you.", "NTA, OP, you are going over the top to be compromising and kind.  You could be angry and sorts of negative things.  But, you pulled the positive aspect out, and dealt with it in a mature manner.  Your half sister is looking for negatively. She isn\u2019t respecting the most basic things.  She is totally going to have the kid call you \u201cAuntie Old Name\u201d.", "NTA. Sounds like she wasn\u2019t listening, which is hardly the way to honour anybody.", "NTA, your sister is delusional. She didn\u2019t name her daughter after you. You\u2019re 100% correct she either just likes the name and is pretending she wanted to honor you or she\u2019s allowing her emotional attachment to your old name to override reality.", " *I told her she used a name I hated and got rid of as soon as I was able....I told her that was no honor to me when she named her daughter. I told her it was because she liked the name and it was one she had some emotional connection for but I would never be touched she chose* THAT *name.*\n\nYou're not even saying she shouldn't have used the name. You're merely noting that it doesn't honor you. She's either not very bright or she's being intentionally obtuse. NTA.", "NTA. OP you could be very heated and in your face about this but instead you are being kind and rationally explained to your little sister why this doesn\u2019t feel like an honor.", "NTA. It just seems like the two of you are miscommunicating? Your sister wants to show you how much she loves you and you are thinking, *'This doesn't feel like love and its getting on my nerves!'* ???\n\nI don't think this was disrespectful of her. (Unless there are other instances of her being inconsiderate?) Its just tone deaf. (She spent her whole life prior to reuniting with you calling you a different name in her head and hearing you referred to by a different name. So, I don't think its actually about your name in this case. Its just a reflection of how she feels about you? And by the same token, you have a different name and you certainly get to require that people get over themselves and get used to it.\n\nNTA. I don't think your sister is an a-hole either. I think that burying the past is hard and we act stupid sometimes in a knee jerk to our evolving needs. (Your sister can name her kid D-O-G if she wants. But, no way you have to accept the compliment and rejoice to the heavens about it. That part is ridiculous to me.)", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
