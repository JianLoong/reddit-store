His parents have never liked me and I\u2019ve been patient about it but I admit it\u2019s hard not to hold onto their hurtful words\n\nThey\u2019ve called me white trash (my mom and uncles have had addictions) that I just moved to get away from my home life etc. It\u2019s hard to describe his parents. They\u2019re christian and \u201cnice\u201d but the feeling of condemnation you feel when with them is hard to miss. The first year we were together his mom sat me down and said she wasn\u2019t sure I was right for her son because I didn\u2019t grow up with a dad (he got hit by a car days after I was born) aside from that conversation they have never come to me and voiced their feelings. They tell everyone else or my husband. I have a million stories I could share honestly lol.\n\nBut you get the idea always dragging my name through the mud, never saying it to me..but my husband has 11 siblings and 5 of them are younger so we\u2019ve always tried to put aside the differences between his parents and I in order to have a good relationship with his little siblings. \n\nI won\u2019t lie it\u2019s always been so uncomfortable for me to go to his parents (they live an hour away) but my husband wants them in his life so we usually go once a month and had the \u201ctradition\u201d to do Christmas Eve at their house and drive home to do Christmas at ours with my family who have moved here. \n\nBut this last year a situation happened where they were all convinced I was having a torrid affair with mine and my brothers best friend from childhood (he lives with us as well as my mom and grandma live here too) \n\nI am not, he\u2019s like another brother and I\u2019ve never cheated on anyone but it didn\u2019t stop his younger sisters from gossiping with everyone I know and her parents and it causing me so much stress and depression that I told my husband I have to be done with his parents for right now\n\nHe understood for the most part. This latest event happened this summer and things have been more peaceful since I\u2019ve stepped back my husband is on good-ish terms with them which is great for him I wouldn\u2019t try and stop their relationship but my husband mentioned last night that we should go a few days early to spend time with his parents since we haven\u2019t seen them since summer. \n\nTook me off guard and I thought it was a joke I told him I am not going and while I would miss him he\u2019s welcome to go spend Christmas Eve with them. He called me selfish and that if I\u2019m a good Christian I need to not hold grudges and I said its beyond that. They have never come to me to talk about anything to remedy it and I won\u2019t pretend everythings ok He said if I was serious about not going then it would be a big problem for him since he lets my family live with us.

The \"it would be a big problem for him since he lets my family live with us\" comment makes me think it was a thinly veiled threat.", "NTA. Your husband said you shouldn't hold grudges - that it's not very Christian. Why is he not holding his family to the same standards? They've had a grudge against you since day one. You need to sit him down and explain exactly why you don't want to go, and ask exactly why he isn't defending you. The fact that he is allowing his family to spread lies, gossip, and insult you is absolutely not okay. Please stay home, and do not subject yourself to being tormented.", "I'm sorry, what now??? His family treats you like garbage and he does absolutely nothing about it?? He expects you to just keep spending time with them like it's no big deal? That's some bullshit right there. And now he's holding your family living with you over your head to guilt you into going? Nope, he's horrible and I'm getting some narcissistic vibes for sure.\n\nNTA, but look, if he legitimately might retaliate against your family or you, do what you need to do to stay safe... but start forming an exit plan. Hopefully I'm overreacting and you'll never need it... but seriously a man who doesn't stand up to his family for you and then guilts *you* over it is not... well, it's not a good sign, okay? And you deserve better.", "Tell your husband if he were a Christian he would actually leave his mother and cleave to his wife like the Bible says. Don\u2019t play Christian if you aren\u2019t even living up to Christian standards. NTA", "NTA. Not your husband trying to use the \"good Christian\" defence when his family have not treated you like actual good Christians would.\n\nIt's not like you're stopping him from having a relationship with his family, but considering how they treat you, I wouldn't even consider you the AH if you did.", "NTA\n\nYou're not holding a grudge. They have been actively trying to destroy your relationship. I doubt they've stopped in the last 6 months, and I doubt it will be any different at Christmas. \n\nHere's a thought though-- maybe say that you have no issue with going as long as they apologize for all the rumors. Once you get that apology, you'd be glad to go and will treat them respectfully, but only if they show you respect first, since you've been nothing but respectful all along. And the thing here is that they'll never admit they did anything they have to apologize for, which can show you (to be fair, you should already know this) just where your husband stands on the issue.\n\nHonestly, I can't imagine how someone can stay with a spouse that doesn't have their back.  It certainly sounds like your husband is choosing his family and their lying ways over you.", "So your husband is fine with listening to his parents call you names and demean your character? How is that being a good Christian? If he\u2019s going to manipulate you through your religion, it can certainly be turned back on him.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This is a pretty major issue and the fact that he's willing to just let it go without any apologies, and the fact that he hasn't stood up for you very strongly says that he either partly believes what they say about you, or he feels that you aren't important enough to defend. The fact that he says you shouldn't hold a grudge when what you're have is trauma and hurt is dismissive.", "If you're a good Christian... you probably shouldn't spend time with these \"Christians.\"  The kind that seem to entirely ignore any and all of Christ's actual teachings.  The ones that describe the Sermon on the Mount as \"weak\" and \"liberal nonsense.\"\n\nWhatever they are... they're not Christian.  Not sure what they are, but I know what they're not. They sound... well, as awful as a lot of the other so-callled \"Christians\" that spend their lives leaping to conclusions, rushing to pass judgement, and rejecting any of the things that Christ actually told his followers to do. NTA.  Avoid them.", "NTA - if someone is insulting to you why go.", "NTA.  It seems like he doesn't get the issue.  He's not the one having the issues. I would seek some couples therapy. I would go for one day.  And he does not leave your side.  If he's not willing to do that, he should go alone.", "I mean, then it's going to be a problem for him to deal with. His uncomfortableness with that is still less than what you went through and sacrifice is part of marriage.", "NTA. Why isn't your husband standing up to his family to defend you? He tells you to be a good Christian and not hold a grudge, but he seems fine with his family treating you like a second class citizen, gossiping about you, telling outright lies about you, and judging you in general for things that you can't control. None of these things scream \"good Christian\" to me.\n\nNot only that, but it isn't holding a grudge if the actions that you are angry about are still ongoing - it's only a grudge if it stopped some time ago and you are still angry. Not only that, but I don't see any sort of remorse or apology from your in-laws. This should be a prerequisite before you agree to go over again, and your husband should understand this as opposed to trying to manipulate you into being in the presence of people who belittle you.\n\nIn short, not only do you have an in-law problem, you have a husband problem.", "If we want to talk about being a good Christian, they violated one of the 10 Commandments by slandering you.  There are piles of biblical quotes about not lying and slandering someone.  Sounds like he let his family go on destroying your good name for quite some time, and without so much as a teenager\u2019s begrudging mumbled \u201csorry\u201d that was clearly compelled from them, he expects you to forgive and forget and go make nice with people who have never treated you with decency, kindness, or respect.\n\nIf he wants you to forgive them, he needs to understand the difference between forgiveness and rug-sweeping.  It is quite reasonable to expect someone to acknowledge their actions and the hurt/damage they caused, take accountability/responsibility, and offer a genuine apology before you\u2019re ready to forgive them.  If they can\u2019t even acknowledge their wrongdoing and apologize, what\u2019s to stop them from continuing with similar bad behavior?  When you behave badly, there are often consequences.\n\nWhere was he in all of this?  Did he defend you?  Did he tell his family they were behaving badly and mistreating both you?  Did he just shrug off the way they damaged your relationship and hurt you and demand you do the same?  That\u2019s rug-sweeping.  You can only hide so much garbage under the rug, and it just lies there and rots and stinks and poisons the room.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Personally i think its unfair of your husband to expect this to be so one sided, its fine for his family to treat you that way but once you stand firm on a boundary you have set its a problem?", "NTA. Using religion as a bludgeon and your family as hostages kinda makes him....", "CINO (Christians in name only) are such a pain.  I'm a bit concerned about your husband's remark about you not being a good Christian.  Seems he really doesn't believe his family has acted in a vile manner.  Fighting a two front war never works out.  If you cannot make him understand the situation, you are in for a painful life.", "What They are doing is not Christian like. If you would be willing to go. If they apologize to you then tell him that's the only way you're willing to go", "NTA suggest some counselling.  You have 3 people that live with you and husband.  What does he put up with on a daily basis?  I highly doubt that there aren't things that bother or annoy him or worse (expressed or not by him).  That doesn't entitle his family to be asses to you.  However, he's checking you - he's willing to live with 3 of your people and whatever stresses they bring to him but what are you willing to do for him where his family is concerned?  I can see it being a big problem like he said if he feels he tolerates your family for you but you're not willing to do same for him.", "You are in a very difficult situation.\r  \n\r  \nUnfortunately if he is \"supporting\" your family, it is a problem.\r  \n\r  \nYou can make an agreement to accompany him to x and then return home in a taxi to be with your family.\r  \n\r  \nAlso tell him that you expect a formal apology from his brothers, who have not behaved like good Christians.", "Oh wow, that\u2019s a tough one. Complicated by the fact that your family lives with you. However, it\u2019s never ok for people to treat you with disrespect\u2026especially family. Maybe you could compromise and schedule a 3rd party to mediate a real conversation?\n\nReally sorry your husband isn\u2019t supporting you on this.

To exclude those that join our family? \n\nIt is his job to stick up for you when his family bad mouths you, not tell you that you need to forgive (especially when it sounds like they haven\u2019t even apologised!). Ask him how he\u2019d feel if your whole family were gossiping about him having an affair.", "His family are such \"nice Christians\" but they're breaking one of the Ten Commandments (thou shalt not bear false witness). I'm not even religious and I know that's a big no-no. You say your husband is a great guy, but a great guy would stand up for his wife, defend his wife, and cut his family off for insulting, slandering and denigrating his wife. You can do better. NTA", "NTA. \n\nSo, you're supposed to be a Christian but his Christian-identifying family isn't? Slandering you and spreading lies (directly against the faith), trying to break up your marriage (so much for \"what God puts together,\" eh?), and ignoring the \"leave and cleave\" part of the faith...oof. \n\nNo. Stand your ground. You can forgive, sure, but that's for you and your faith walk. It cannot be forced for it to be real. You do not have to spend time with evil serpents to prove your faith or your love for your husband.", "NTA...  Haha.. he played the Good Christian card on you..  but if his evil parents could be the Good Christians they think they are then you would be going.  Stand your ground life is too short for having to deal with the nasty people and hold it in.. or go there and tear them a new arsehole in which case you will probably never have to go again ..", "NTA\u2026.Maybe if they were good Christian\u2019s, they would not be so judgmental.    Tell your husband, you are done.  For nine years you have tried.  When gave his parents ever tried?  Never.  He is welcome to have a relationship with his parents, but you are not wasting another nine years.  Life is too short.  And why hasn\u2019t he stood up for you before now?  You should come first.", "NTA- he needs to fuck right off with that \"if you were a good christian\" shit. He's just weaponizing religion to get you to do what he wants. Disgusting", "NTA \"if you are a good Christian?!\" That line alone just makes me realise your husband is the AH. His family haven't ever behaved in a good Christian way. I don't blame you not wanting to see them after their behaviour.", "NTA If they were good Christians they wouldn\u2019t talk behind your back and accuse you of horrible things. BTW what good mother says you\u2019re not good enough for her son because your father died? Please don\u2019t ever call them nice again. They are far from nice.", "You\u2019re NTA. I get so sick and tired of people using Christianity as reason to mistreat others. His parents are not nice. His parents are not Christians. Christmas is to be spent with family and those that love you. Your husband should stand up for you. Why do you have to go with him when he visits once a month? Why can\u2019t you stay home? If you\u2019re not joining the hip, there\u2019s no reason for you to go to allow these people to continue to disrespect you. If he won\u2019t stand up for you, you need to stand up for yourself. Boundaries are very important. \n\nAnd make sure you tell your husband that if he was a good Christian husband, he would defend you. Tell your husband that when he married, he is supposed to leave his family to the wayside. You are supposed to come first. Your feelings are supposed to matter. Tell your husband that if his sisters and parents were good people they wouldn\u2019t gossip about you. Be sure to tell them that\u2019s in the Bible.\n\nIs he threatening to throw your family out because you won\u2019t allow his family to verbally abuse you anymore? You didn\u2019t marry a good guy. He\u2019s a dick. A dick with warts on it.\n\nEdit: you need to remind him that you\u2019re his family too. You\u2019re not just the neighbor he\u2019s fucking. You\u2019re not his girlfriend. You\u2019re his wife.", "NTA.   Your husband needs to realize his parents are being judgemental AH. Husband needs to realize he is falling in AH category for not standing up for you and your marriage.  Why does his parents get to say anything about your side living with you?\n\n  If it gets worked out and you go again in a few years then you stay at hotel (as siblings can come swim).  You are in charge of car keys those days to so if they pull crap you can leave", "NTA. Are you aware your husband is letting his parent to hurt and direspect you. You have a husband problem.", "Wonder if these Christians open up their Bibles or they're the luke warm Christian types.\n\nI could easily give them verses that showcase their hypocrisy.", "NTA but your husband chose his toxic family over you 1000%. You calling him a great guy in the comments is simply delusional. He doesn't really care about you.", "NTA your husband is. He allows his family to verbally abuse you and then tries to force you into a corner\u2026", "NTA\n\nReconsider your marriage to him bc he\u2019s not standing up for you at all. You\u2019re his wife, he should act like it", "You want to get them? Go to their priest/pastor and let him know what's been going on in the family and that you want to have a mediation. Fake Christians can't handle people thinking that they're anything other than Christ like.", "NTA. But tell me what this man\u2019s redeeming qualities are?  I mean he allowed his family to bear false witness about his wife, treat is wife like crap for the last 9 years. Call her names. And then he threatens your family living with you all in the family home. It is your home too. So what are is good qualities here?", "if I\u2019m a good Christian\n\nHard stop. Definitely NTA. Once the \"good christian\" comment comes out, you need to shut that shit down HARD. Religion shouldn't be used as a weapon to force you to do something you don't want to.", "NTA! This is not mine but I didn\u2019t see it, so I will post: ain\u2019t no love like christian hate. This is your in laws. \n\nYour in laws are not good christians. They are judgmental, and in the worst way. I also bet they gossip, and spread rumors or make them up, like here! They made up an entire affair. GOOD christians would apologize. You should insist on that and so would a GOOD husband. I would not go either.", "> Good Christian \n\n\nAt this point, just walk out. NTA but stop letting those things treat you like that.", "Ask him does your family disrespect him? Do they gossip about him? Make him feel unwelcome? Also ask him why he lets his family do that to you? Why does he ALLOW them do disrespect his wife? It is not very Christian of him to do that. \n\nTell him that when his parents want to show respect to you and want to act like proper Christians and stop holding on to their grudges against you, you will be here and they can come and do that. \n\nNTA", "Ask him if he feels his family are good Christians because his family lied and gossiped about you, and quote James 1:26 to him - Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight rein on their tongues deceive themselves, and their religion is worthless.\n\nyou are NTA", "Then he didn\u2019t back you up this summer.. he planted you until *he* thought it was enough time and now demands you conform or calls into question your religious commitment.\n\nHe sounds pretty manipulative.\n\nNTA - **you can absolutely forgive someone, and still not want to engage with them!** It\u2019s not mutually exclusive.", "So he doesn't believe in defending his wife against his family's cruel and baseless attacks. Got it.", "Your husband \u201clets\u201d your family live with him huh? You don\u2019t have Inlaw problems you have husband problems.", "Doesn\u2019t sound all that great. That\u2019s a threat in a language. Also, if he is so Christian why is he threatening to make people homeless at Xmas? Does he not appreciate the irony? NTA", ">he is pretty passive but stands his ground on things he believes in\n\nSo you're saying he doesn't believe that you deserve basic respect and human decency? Because if he did, he would stand up for you. Fuck this guy.", "All this tells me is that he doesn\u2019t really consider you his family.", "This just means he doesn't believe in the two of you. It should be an easy choice.", ">He\u2019s a great guy\n\nHe continuously let's his family abuse you and now implied he would, what, kick out your family (?) if you don't go spend time with his asshole family? Reconsider, that doesn't sound GREAT to me", "He is not a great guy, why would he allow his family to say crap about his wife. Why would he threaten her family staying in their home?", "A  \"Great Guy\" wouldn't let his family do that to you.", "If he lets his shitty family treat you like crap & puts them above HIS WIFE he's not that great of a guy, sadly. And the thinly veiled threats..... yikes. Lots of thinking on your part is needed. \n\nSometimes people marry someone they think is beneath them so they can feel superior & have control (like the kicking your family out if you don't do what he says)", "Yeah I don't think so. \n\nHe's a mommas boy, who's is threatening to throw out your family and divorce you, if you don't visit his parents. \n\nHe 100% believes everything his parents and family are saying about you. \n\nI bet he also believes the affair comment and doesn't trust you to stay home alone. \n\nYour husband isn't a good guy. He's horrible.\n\nWhat kind of husband would let his family treat his wife like this.\n\n Ugh, you deserve better.", "You need to remind him that a \"good christian\" wouldn't treat you like this and a \"good christian\" would abuse you like his mother is doing. \n\nIf anyone isn't acting like a good christian, it's his mother.", "Discuss.", "No he hasn\u2019t. If he was actually defending you then he would set boundaries and they would be told that if they continue to treat his wife this way they will no longer be part of his life through their own choices. \n\nHe knows that upsetting you is easier to deal with than upsetting his mother, so he\u2019s choosing to let it keep happening.", "Apologies from them or you're not going. My mother was a freaking genius when it came to teaching someone a lesson. She said there are very few nasty behaviors that can't be fixed with public humiliation. I believed that until very recently. It always worked on all us kids. But, I think making them all apologize might be enough humiliation to get them to think twice before doing it again. You need to preface it with their behavior towards you is unacceptable and you will no longer tolerate it.", "Or maybe OP could read this to them at Christmas dinner.", "I\u2019m not even sure to be honest. When I got accused by their oldest daughter who was 38 at the time, of selling and using cocaine. And it made where his parents weren\u2019t letting us see his younger siblings, I immediately contacted her and to defend myself and convey I\u2019ve never done any drugs aside from pot in my life and looking back, he never went and spoke to her about it and then his mom texted me telling me how utterly wrong I was to \u201clash out\u201d at their daughter and essentially I made a fool of myself. Really made me think back on that one, should of realized then I didn\u2019t have him as back up.", "Seconded.   I'm sorry OP, but he is not a great guy.  A great guy would have your back, in spite of his family.  Please DO NOT have children with this guy.  The family will become even more unbearable.\n\nNTA.", "You should know what he is saying to defend you. Or is not saying. Don\u2019t be in the dark about how much your husband actually has your back. If he loves you then it should be blatantly obvious when it comes to standing up for you.

I love you - show me.", "And there's your close proof that he probably believes what they're saying, agreeing with them and making them happy. \n\nHe doesn't care about you and he's not goingntondefend you. \n\nSo do it yourself. And you can start by leaving him.", "Sounds like he\u2019s more than happy to thump his invisible bible at you when it suits him.", "Then what\u2019s the point of him? Any good qualities he might have are cancelled out by the fact that he chooses to let people say such horrible things about his wife.", "So your husband, who is a great guy didn\u2019t have your back here."]}
