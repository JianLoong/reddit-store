We met online and I moved from CA to WA state when got together and got married a year after. His parents have never liked me and I\u2019ve been patient about it but I admit it\u2019s hard not to hold onto their hurtful words\n\nThey\u2019ve called me white trash (my mom and uncles have had addictions) that I just moved to get away from my home life etc. It\u2019s hard to describe his parents. They\u2019re christian and \u201cnice\u201d but the feeling of condemnation you feel when with them is hard to miss. The first year we were together his mom sat me down and said she wasn\u2019t sure I was right for her son because I didn\u2019t grow up with a dad (he got hit by a car days after I was born) aside from that conversation they have never come to me and voiced their feelings. They tell everyone else or my husband. I have a million stories I could share honestly lol.\n\nBut you get the idea always dragging my name through the mud, never saying it to me..but my husband has 11 siblings and 5 of them are younger so we\u2019ve always tried to put aside the differences between his parents and I in order to have a good relationship with his little siblings. \n\nI won\u2019t lie it\u2019s always been so uncomfortable for me to go to his parents (they live an hour away) but my husband wants them in his life so we usually go once a month and had the \u201ctradition\u201d to do Christmas Eve at their house and drive home to do Christmas at ours with my family who have moved here. \n\nBut this last year a situation happened where they were all convinced I was having a torrid affair with mine and my brothers best friend from childhood (he lives with us as well as my mom and grandma live here too) \n\nI am not, he\u2019s like another brother and I\u2019ve never cheated on anyone but it didn\u2019t stop his younger sisters from gossiping with everyone I know and her parents and it causing me so much stress and depression that I told my husband I have to be done with his parents for right now\n\nHe understood for the most part. This latest event happened this summer and things have been more peaceful since I\u2019ve stepped back my husband is on good-ish terms with them which is great for him I wouldn\u2019t try and stop their relationship but my husband mentioned last night that we should go a few days early to spend time with his parents since we haven\u2019t seen them since summer. \n\nTook me off guard and I thought it was a joke I told him I am not going and while I would miss him he\u2019s welcome to go spend Christmas Eve with them. He called me selfish and that if I\u2019m a good Christian I need to not hold grudges and I said its beyond that. They have never come to me to talk about anything to remedy it and I won\u2019t pretend everythings ok He said if I was serious about not going then it would be a big problem for him since he lets my family live with us. So I\u2019m at a loss if im being an asshole for refusing to go?\n\nUPDATE: I just want to thank everyone for their support, I feel it\u2019s hard to condense 9 years of drama with his family into 3k of words. I do stand by that he is a good person, he has never agreed with their comments or gossip, but he has an issue standing up to his family, and it\u2019s an issue we have always faced unfortunately. I spoke with him this morning and I told him I won\u2019t subject myself to his family and their unpleasantness at my favorite time of year or anytime of year for that matter until they can come and speak to me and apologize in order to have a relationship with them. I told him I do forgive them: it\u2019s not my place to judge but that doesn\u2019t mean I need to be in their lives either. He apologized to me and told me he didn\u2019t mean what he said, he just didn\u2019t want to have to deal with their complaints by us not going, and I told him then he needs to have a real and honest look at how unbalanced his relationship is with them.

The \"it would be a big problem for him since he lets my family live with us\" comment makes me think it was a thinly veiled threat.", "NTA. Your husband said you shouldn't hold grudges - that it's not very Christian. Why is he not holding his family to the same standards? They've had a grudge against you since day one. You need to sit him down and explain exactly why you don't want to go, and ask exactly why he isn't defending you. The fact that he is allowing his family to spread lies, gossip, and insult you is absolutely not okay. Please stay home, and do not subject yourself to being tormented.", "I'm sorry, what now??? His family treats you like garbage and he does absolutely nothing about it?? He expects you to just keep spending time with them like it's no big deal? That's some bullshit right there. And now he's holding your family living with you over your head to guilt you into going? Nope, he's horrible and I'm getting some narcissistic vibes for sure.\n\nNTA, but look, if he legitimately might retaliate against your family or you, do what you need to do to stay safe... but start forming an exit plan. Hopefully I'm overreacting and you'll never need it... but seriously a man who doesn't stand up to his family for you and then guilts *you* over it is not... well, it's not a good sign, okay? And you deserve better.", "Tell your husband if he were a Christian he would actually leave his mother and cleave to his wife like the Bible says. Don\u2019t play Christian if you aren\u2019t even living up to Christian standards. NTA", "NTA. Not your husband trying to use the \"good Christian\" defence when his family have not treated you like actual good Christians would.\n\nIt's not like you're stopping him from having a relationship with his family, but considering how they treat you, I wouldn't even consider you the AH if you did.", "NTA\n\nYou're not holding a grudge. They have been actively trying to destroy your relationship. I doubt they've stopped in the last 6 months, and I doubt it will be any different at Christmas. \n\nHere's a thought though-- maybe say that you have no issue with going as long as they apologize for all the rumors. Once you get that apology, you'd be glad to go and will treat them respectfully, but only if they show you respect first, since you've been nothing but respectful all along. And the thing here is that they'll never admit they did anything they have to apologize for, which can show you (to be fair, you should already know this) just where your husband stands on the issue.\n\nHonestly, I can't imagine how someone can stay with a spouse that doesn't have their back.  It certainly sounds like your husband is choosing his family and their lying ways over you.", "So your husband is fine with listening to his parents call you names and demean your character? How is that being a good Christian? If he\u2019s going to manipulate you through your religion, it can certainly be turned back on him.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This is a pretty major issue and the fact that he's willing to just let it go without any apologies, and the fact that he hasn't stood up for you very strongly says that he either partly believes what they say about you, or he feels that you aren't important enough to defend. The fact that he says you shouldn't hold a grudge when what you're have is trauma and hurt is dismissive.", "If you're a good Christian... you probably shouldn't spend time with these \"Christians.\"  The kind that seem to entirely ignore any and all of Christ's actual teachings.  The ones that describe the Sermon on the Mount as \"weak\" and \"liberal nonsense.\"\n\nWhatever they are... they're not Christian.  Not sure what they are, but I know what they're not. They sound... well, as awful as a lot of the other so-callled \"Christians\" that spend their lives leaping to conclusions, rushing to pass judgement, and rejecting any of the things that Christ actually told his followers to do. NTA.  Avoid them.", "NTA - if someone is insulting to you why go.", "NTA.  It seems like he doesn't get the issue.  He's not the one having the issues. I would seek some couples therapy. I would go for one day.  And he does not leave your side.  If he's not willing to do that, he should go alone.", "I mean, then it's going to be a problem for him to deal with. His uncomfortableness with that is still less than what you went through and sacrifice is part of marriage.", "NTA. Why isn't your husband standing up to his family to defend you? He tells you to be a good Christian and not hold a grudge, but he seems fine with his family treating you like a second class citizen, gossiping about you, telling outright lies about you, and judging you in general for things that you can't control. None of these things scream \"good Christian\" to me.\n\nNot only that, but it isn't holding a grudge if the actions that you are angry about are still ongoing - it's only a grudge if it stopped some time ago and you are still angry. Not only that, but I don't see any sort of remorse or apology from your in-laws. This should be a prerequisite before you agree to go over again, and your husband should understand this as opposed to trying to manipulate you into being in the presence of people who belittle you.\n\nIn short, not only do you have an in-law problem, you have a husband problem.", "If we want to talk about being a good Christian, they violated one of the 10 Commandments by slandering you.  There are piles of biblical quotes about not lying and slandering someone.  Sounds like he let his family go on destroying your good name for quite some time, and without so much as a teenager\u2019s begrudging mumbled \u201csorry\u201d that was clearly compelled from them, he expects you to forgive and forget and go make nice with people who have never treated you with decency, kindness, or respect.\n\nIf he wants you to forgive them, he needs to understand the difference between forgiveness and rug-sweeping.  It is quite reasonable to expect someone to acknowledge their actions and the hurt/damage they caused, take accountability/responsibility, and offer a genuine apology before you\u2019re ready to forgive them.  If they can\u2019t even acknowledge their wrongdoing and apologize, what\u2019s to stop them from continuing with similar bad behavior?  When you behave badly, there are often consequences.\n\nWhere was he in all of this?  Did he defend you?  Did he tell his family they were behaving badly and mistreating both you?  Did he just shrug off the way they damaged your relationship and hurt you and demand you do the same?  That\u2019s rug-sweeping.  You can only hide so much garbage under the rug, and it just lies there and rots and stinks and poisons the room.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Personally i think its unfair of your husband to expect this to be so one sided, its fine for his family to treat you that way but once you stand firm on a boundary you have set its a problem?", "NTA. Using religion as a bludgeon and your family as hostages kinda makes him....", "CINO (Christians in name only) are such a pain.  I'm a bit concerned about your husband's remark about you not being a good Christian.  Seems he really doesn't believe his family has acted in a vile manner.  Fighting a two front war never works out.  If you cannot make him understand the situation, you are in for a painful life.", "What They are doing is not Christian like. If you would be willing to go. If they apologize to you then tell him that's the only way you're willing to go", "NTA suggest some counselling.  You have 3 people that live with you and husband.  What does he put up with on a daily basis?  I highly doubt that there aren't things that bother or annoy him or worse (expressed or not by him).  That doesn't entitle his family to be asses to you.  However, he's checking you - he's willing to live with 3 of your people and whatever stresses they bring to him but what are you willing to do for him where his family is concerned?  I can see it being a big problem like he said if he feels he tolerates your family for you but you're not willing to do same for him.", "You are in a very difficult situation.\r  \n\r  \nUnfortunately if he is \"supporting\" your family, it is a problem.\r  \n\r  \nYou can make an agreement to accompany him to x and then return home in a taxi to be with your family.\r  \n\r  \nAlso tell him that you expect a formal apology from his brothers, who have not behaved like good Christians.", "Oh wow, that\u2019s a tough one. Complicated by the fact that your family lives with you. However, it\u2019s never ok for people to treat you with disrespect\u2026especially family. Maybe you could compromise and schedule a 3rd party to mediate a real conversation?\n\nReally sorry your husband isn\u2019t supporting you on this.
