She's just really never taken care of herself and always had help around her, so after my father passed, she really needed someone to step in and follow through on the things she wanted. She's never handled money her entire life, so starting now, especially when everything is online would be near impossible. She has zero technological savvy.  \n\n\nINFO: I am one of four siblings, the only daughter. Everyone is just expecting that I do all the unpaid labor because I'm a woman.   \n\n\nINFO: We also live in a very expensive area of the country (West Coast) and I have felt like I couldn't leave despite really being priced out because my parents live here and I take care of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBackground: I (55F) am one of three siblings and we all live in different areas of the country, far enough that it's flying distance. My parents moved to my hometown about 25 years ago and, even though I work full-time, a lot of the responsibility of taking care of them has fallen on me. Things like, making sure they went to the doctors appt, helping move furniture, etc.\n\nMy father passed away in 2019 and had a bit of money, \\~$5 million. My parents lived *extremely* frugally but made decent money, so it wasn't much of a surprise that it was there. After he passed, I had my mother (88F) sign over the power of attorney to me.\n\nThe situation has turned into a huge fight. I don't think my mother really has the mental capacity at this point to understand her finances. I frankly just think it would confuse her at this point. So I've kept the finances private, only to me. Every now and them, my mother says she'd like a full picture of what her finances are, but she doesn't follow up. My siblings are demanding that I hand over the money and have an outside person manage it, but legally, it's not their business.\n\nSince my father passed, my mother has really enjoyed spending her money for things for my family. She bought one of my son's a new SUV and bought my daughter a dream wedding dress and paid for her honeymoon. She's even been talking about wanting to buy my husband and I a new home. She mentioned wanting to do things for the other grand children (there are 6 total not including my kids), but hasn't followed up.\n\nMy siblings are much wealthier than I am. They don't need the money, they just want it out of \"equity\" and on principal. If anything, my mother's money is helping me live at the standard that they've all enjoyed for years. I did 25 years of unpaid labor helping my parents; if anything, this is the most equitable solution.\n\nMy siblings are threatening to take my to court over this, but I'm just following my mother's wishes.

There is no evidence your is mentally incompetent. You assert that financial matters \"would confuse her at this point,\" but without evidence and clearly without having obtained a medical opinion on the question.

You are sour because you are jealous of your siblings' wealth and think they don't \"need\" the inheritance. That is not your place to decide -- it's for the person whose assets are being distributed, i.e., your mother. \n\n4. If you are the executor of her estate you may have legal obligations to avoid conflicts of interest. Your siblings are correct to get lawyers involved to defend their interests.\n\n5.

It\u2019s not your dads money anymore its her. If she says she wants to do something for your siblings help her follow through with it", "This will turn on how the Power of Attorney is written. In most states in the US, the state promulgated form does not allow the attorney-in-fact  or agent (you) to make gifts to yourself from the the Principal\u2019s (your mom) estate. This is known as self dealing. However, if the document was custom drafted and state law allows it, the document itself might allow the attorney-in-facts to make gifts to themselves. \n\nHaving worked for financial institutions handling the legal part of death claims I saw this situation a lot. We would review the POA document to ensure the ability to take the money was in the document. \n\nThe biggest concern is you raising the lack of capacity issue. If your mother lacks capacity to take care of her financial issues, she might lack capacity to execute a valid power of attorney.  If she had signed a document years ago that only takes effect upon her incapacity then this might not be an issue. But, if was signed due to your perception of her lack of capacity, then it\u2019s likely to be held invalid if challenged by your siblings. In the latter event, the appropriate steps would have been to go to court and be appointed guardian (or custodian) of your mother\u2019s estate. This could be expensive as it would require that you provide the court with periodic updates.\n\nA cheaper alternative is for you to get your siblings to agree for the funds to go into a trust or custodianship for your mother, possibly with you as trustee or agent. You would still be required to provide accountings to your mother and and other beneficiaries but would not require filing with court. \n\nNTA for feeling the way you do, as this is common.

My parents moved to my hometown about 25 years ago and, even though I work full-time, a lot of the responsibility of taking care of them has fallen on me. Things like, making sure they went to the doctors appt, helping move furniture, etc.\n\nMy father passed away in 2019 and had a bit of money, \\~$5 million. My parents lived *extremely* frugally but made decent money, so it wasn't much of a surprise that it was there. After he passed, I had my mother (88F) sign over the power of attorney to me.\n\nThe situation has turned into a huge fight. I don't think my mother really has the mental capacity at this point to understand her finances. I frankly just think it would confuse her at this point. So I've kept the finances private, only to me. Every now and them, my mother says she'd like a full picture of what her finances are, but she doesn't follow up. My siblings are demanding that I hand over the money and have an outside person manage it, but legally, it's not their business.\n\nSince my father passed, my mother has really enjoyed spending her money for things for my family. She bought one of my son's a new SUV and bought my daughter a dream wedding dress and paid for her honeymoon. She's even been talking about wanting to buy my husband and I a new home. She mentioned wanting to do things for the other grand children (there are 6 total not including my kids), but hasn't followed up.\n\nMy siblings are much wealthier than I am. They don't need the money, they just want it out of \"equity\" and on principal. If anything, my mother's money is helping me live at the standard that they've all enjoyed for years. I did 25 years of unpaid labor helping my parents; if anything, this is the most equitable solution.\n\nMy siblings are threatening to take my to court over this, but I'm just following my mother's wishes. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
