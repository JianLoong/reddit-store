When we met he was taking a lot of anti anxiety medication (Xanax specifically) which caused him to sometimes get abusive (hair pulling, shoving) he sobered up within a month and things got a bit better although we had a lot of differences and would still somewhat argue. (I am in no way condoning his behavior I called the cops multiple times on him for acting this way and I am not used to any kind of abuse, I\u2019ve also  been told to stop seeing him which I have tried multiple times but we always end up speaking to each other again.) \n\nToday another argument issued and I\u2019m not sure if I was the a-hole here, according to him I was. He wanted to come over at my place and hangout which I agreed to, when he got here he said he was hungry and so was I so I started suggesting fast food places we could go to. He then said he wanted me to cook him pasta, I said the dishes aren\u2019t done and I didn\u2019t have the necessary ingredients so I\u2019d much rather have a quick bite somewhere, he called me a bitch for not wanting to make food after a bit of back and forth we make up and agree to get some groceries from the store which he said he wanted to pay for. \n\nWe get to the store and we start picking out ingredients after we got done he said he \u00ab\u00a0forgot his phone in my car and couldn\u2019t use his Apple Pay\u00a0\u00bb he also didn\u2019t have his wallet so he basically forced me to pay which upset me because he said he was going to do it (he would pull this a lot when he was high on the anti anxiety meds, I still used to pay for the food because I didn\u2019t know better at the time) but now I was furious because I knew he was lying to my face. I pay, we get out of the store and I let him know that I know he had his phone with him.

I said well now that we\u2019re out can you Apple Pay me the money because you said you\u2019d pay for the groceries and I will be cooking for us later. He suddenly starts yelling at my face how much he\u2019s stressed out and bangs his fist hard on my dashboard. He also tells me to shut the fuck up or he\u2019s gonna spit on me. This is when I speed drive to my apartment complex and park in front of people (which I did on purpose so he wouldn\u2019t hurt me or act up since there were people around) and basically told him to go home. He got out of my car and refused to leave my apartment complex. (He is still roaming the premises as I\u2019m typing this).
