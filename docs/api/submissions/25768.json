Now I do. My parents approached me Saturday about the upcoming school year and the fact it's my last year of high school and said they wanted to legally change my name to Philip and to give me a new middle name that would be more professional and adult sounding. I asked them what made them think I wanted that given I already told them not to call me that. They said they'd tried to appeal to my brother before he left for college but he refused to entertain the idea. So they wanted to start earlier with me. They said they have huge regrets about our names, especially mine, as it's so trendy and not very professional sounding. I told them I like my name and to let it go because I am Caden whether they like the fact or not.\n\nMy grandparents (dad's parents) were invited over to interfere in this as well. Apparently they never liked our names and are absolutely on board the \"he needs an old ass name to get somewhere in life\".

Upon hearing this I told them I would not discuss it with them anymore and I refuse to change my name. My parents and my grandparents all think I'm being unreasonable and they say I should listen to their reasoning more and really think about it.\n\nI feel like this is SO dumb.

The idea that such a hugely popular name will still seem notably unprofessional in the future falls apart completely if you think about it for even a second. \n\nAnd a few years ago, I hired an Ashton and an Ashtyn in the same week. No one cares about this. \n\nNTA. \n \nEven if their premise wasn't completely ridiculous, still NTA. It's your name. You shouldn't be forced to change it if you don't want to.", "NTA, this is so weird. There's nothing wrong with either of your names, I don't get their concerns. Maybe if your name was R2D2 and your brother was C3PO, then sure...?", "NTA - \u201cI want this to be the last time we talk about this: I don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t like my name. It\u2019s MY name. I want to live with it and so I will not be changing it. If you continue to push me, it will not end up well for our relationship. So ask yourself if this fight is really worth it. You do not get to disregard my feelings for your vanity and you do not get to manipulate me for your own peace of mind. This is my name and my name is no longer your concern. The answer is no.\u201d\n\n\nDrop that hammer on your family and then hold your ground. If your parents bring it up, stare right through them and then ignore the fuck out of them until they get the hint. This is absolutely bullshit and they can stroke their audacity elsewhere. Proud of you for standing up for yourself.", "This sounds more like grandparents trying to force a name change over inheritance.", "NTA- They got to pick your name when you were born.

If I were you, anytime they use the wrong name just ignore them.", "Nta\n\nYour parents had their pick.\n\nNow it's your name and you like it.\n\nIf any strangers ever question your name you have a good story.\n\n\nMy parents were on the good drugs when they named me. They spent 15 years trying to convince the world it was a good name. Then they changed their mind and tried and failed to change it.", "NTA not their decision anymore. What will they do if they start to dislike the new name next year?", "NTA.\n\nThat's delusional of them.  If you like you name there's absolutely no reason to remotely entertain this.  Be firm with them, and let them know if they mention it you will change it - to remove Philip entirely.", "Clearly NTA.  And just super weird.  I understand regretting giving your kiddo a \u201ctrendy\u201d name - but that\u2019s a regret that should live in your head and NEVER be voiced to the person you named.  And as teenagers, the time to \u201cfix\u201d it has sailed (I\u2019d argue it sailed the moment the name went on the birth certificate, but at LEAST before you actually understand your name).", "NTA, they can call you what you want to be called or they don't have to speak to you again. It is weird and creepy they think at near 18 they can just change your name.", "NTA.  Changing a name is not a simple process, and has impacts for the rest of your life.\n\nFor example, here in the UK, my parents changed my last name.  Now every time I need a document, like driving licence, voting card, passport, anything, I need a birth cert,  and a change of name deed.  A change of name deed literally needs to be refreshed every time I get a new document, and they cost a small fortune, cos only a lawyer can make that document.  I have probably payed thousands out for change of name deeds over the years.\n\nEdit, it can make it difficult in gaining employment because, verify your past employment history, verify your your education, verify any professional qualifications that you have, What I have listed is just a few things you run into.  You need a change of name deed for simple things like university loans, mortgages, loans, and its a headache every single time, and I wish my parents never did it.\n\nParents dont realise the real world implications of what a change of name can do.  Really stick to your guns and DONT, and I repeat DONT DO IT!!!  You will regret it for the rest of your life.", "NTA - at this point I would just refuse to discuss it anytime they tried to mention it.", "NTA. It's an issue they could have cleared up LONG ago before you two grew up with your names as is. It's why naming at birth should be treated as serious as possible because they'd be just like you if the roles were reversed and you didn't like your name. Plus, them casting doubt on your future strictly because of it, like there's not a timeline where it doesn't f\\*\\*king matter & you carve out a good living for yourself, is wild to me.", "NTA. It's your name, you get to decide now. They had their chance and they (in their opinion) stuffed it up. No do overs. If they were worried about your future they should have been worried about it when they named you. They named you like *babies* not *people*, with absolutely no thought of the future. It proves that they were childish themselves then, too full of themselves to listen to their own parents warnings, and too childish *now* to recognise that they don't get to just rename you like a WiFi router.\n\nAshton and Caden are fine names. Sure, they're not an old school William or Michael or Douglas. They date themselves, but so do older names. You're going to be professionally surrounded by people with names much like yours. You'll be fine and they're worried over nothing.", "NTA and you're right, this is SO dumb. How ridiculous of your parents and grandparents to try this and think you and your brother will just go along. I've never heard of such a thing in my life! And anyone who doesn't want to hire you based solely on your name, well.. do you really want to for a person/company like that anyway, that places so little value on you as a person? No.", "NTA. It\u2019s your name and your decision.", "Nta. Most of my kids have very normal names. One has a very unusual name. All of my kids love their names.  But if they wanted, I'd pay for a name change.  But it's their name, and they need to be able to live with it. I love their names and would be sad if they wanted to change, but it belongs to them, not me. It would be entirely their choice.", "NTA and your parents are being absolutely ridiculous. You've been Caden all your life and for them to try to rename you this late is plain stupid. Stick to your guns and do not respond to anything but the name YOU want to be called.

That should be it end of discussion\n\nParents are being AH's", "I personally think Caden, Ash, and Phil sound good. George sounds so old. I'm in my mid thirties. I am a professional. I would interview anyone with those names. Who do you think will look at your CV? Someone your grandma's age? I don't think so. The name doesn't matter that much. How you conduct yourself in the interview is the deciding factor.\n\nBesides. You're Caden. That's who you are. \n\nWrite down a list of reasons why you want to remain as Caden and how changing names will impact you psychologically, socially, and how inconvenient the paperwork will be for you in the future!!\n\nRead it to your parents to show you've deeply considered this, but no thanks.", "Although being a non-American so I think names like \u201cCaden\u201d, \u201cAshton\u201d, \u201cParker\u201d, \u201cBuck\u201d, \u201cGunner\u201d, \u201cTaylor\u201d etc. are just about the ugliest names ever, this is fucked up. I don\u2019t say that to offend, I have a point with it. Even in my country where your names would stick out like sore thumbs, they would not have a negative impact on your life. Unless you have a name that for racist reasons clock you as a minority (which is horrible), no one\u2019s going to pay special attention to your names or bar you from certain jobs for having \u201cunprofessional\u201d names\u2026 What even is a \u201cprofessional\u201d name?
