Now I do. My parents approached me Saturday about the upcoming school year and the fact it's my last year of high school and said they wanted to legally change my name to Philip and to give me a new middle name that would be more professional and adult sounding. I asked them what made them think I wanted that given I already told them not to call me that. They said they'd tried to appeal to my brother before he left for college but he refused to entertain the idea. So they wanted to start earlier with me.

The idea that such a hugely popular name will still seem notably unprofessional in the future falls apart completely if you think about it for even a second. \n\nAnd a few years ago, I hired an Ashton and an Ashtyn in the same week. No one cares about this. \n\nNTA. \n \nEven if their premise wasn't completely ridiculous, still NTA. It's your name. You shouldn't be forced to change it if you don't want to.", "NTA, this is so weird. There's nothing wrong with either of your names, I don't get their concerns. Maybe if your name was R2D2 and your brother was C3PO, then sure...?", "NTA - \u201cI want this to be the last time we talk about this: I don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t like my name. It\u2019s MY name. I want to live with it and so I will not be changing it. If you continue to push me, it will not end up well for our relationship. So ask yourself if this fight is really worth it. You do not get to disregard my feelings for your vanity and you do not get to manipulate me for your own peace of mind. This is my name and my name is no longer your concern. The answer is no.\u201d\n\n\nDrop that hammer on your family and then hold your ground. If your parents bring it up, stare right through them and then ignore the fuck out of them until they get the hint. This is absolutely bullshit and they can stroke their audacity elsewhere.

What will they do if they start to dislike the new name next year?", "NTA.\n\nThat's delusional of them.  If you like you name there's absolutely no reason to remotely entertain this.  Be firm with them, and let them know if they mention it you will change it - to remove Philip entirely.", "Clearly NTA.  And just super weird.  I understand regretting giving your kiddo a \u201ctrendy\u201d name - but that\u2019s a regret that should live in your head and NEVER be voiced to the person you named.  And as teenagers, the time to \u201cfix\u201d it has sailed (I\u2019d argue it sailed the moment the name went on the birth certificate, but at LEAST before you actually understand your name).", "NTA, they can call you what you want to be called or they don't have to speak to you again. It is weird and creepy they think at near 18 they can just change your name.", "NTA.  Changing a name is not a simple process, and has impacts for the rest of your life.\n\nFor example, here in the UK, my parents changed my last name.  Now every time I need a document, like driving licence, voting card, passport, anything, I need a birth cert,  and a change of name deed.  A change of name deed literally needs to be refreshed every time I get a new document, and they cost a small fortune, cos only a lawyer can make that document.  I have probably payed thousands out for change of name deeds over the years.\n\nEdit, it can make it difficult in gaining employment because, verify your past employment history, verify your your education, verify any professional qualifications that you have, What I have listed is just a few things you run into.  You need a change of name deed for simple things like university loans, mortgages, loans, and its a headache every single time, and I wish my parents never did it.\n\nParents dont realise the real world implications of what a change of name can do.  Really stick to your guns and DONT, and I repeat DONT DO IT!!!  You will regret it for the rest of your life.", "NTA - at this point I would just refuse to discuss it anytime they tried to mention it.", "NTA. It's an issue they could have cleared up LONG ago before you two grew up with your names as is. It's why naming at birth should be treated as serious as possible because they'd be just like you if the roles were reversed and you didn't like your name.

It's your name, you get to decide now. They had their chance and they (in their opinion) stuffed it up. No do overs. If they were worried about your future they should have been worried about it when they named you. They named you like *babies* not *people*, with absolutely no thought of the future.

How ridiculous of your parents and grandparents to try this and think you and your brother will just go along. I've never heard of such a thing in my life! And anyone who doesn't want to hire you based solely on your name, well.. do you really want to work for a person/company like that anyway, that places so little value on you as a person? No.", "NTA.

But it's their name, and they need to be able to live with it. I love their names and would be sad if they wanted to change, but it belongs to them, not me. It would be entirely their choice.", "NTA and your parents are being absolutely ridiculous. You've been Caden all your life and for them to try to rename you this late is plain stupid.

I don\u2019t say that to offend, I have a point with it. Even in my country where your names would stick out like sore thumbs, they would not have a negative impact on your life.

Hell, I take this viewpoint. If we understand each other why are we arguing about if a word is real?\n\nHowever the appeal to authority of \"it's in the dictionary and therefore correct\" actually brings you closer in philosophy to those you oppose. By insisting that the institution of the dictionary acts as a sort of Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise you're still saying that the language that people speak isn't The Living Language but rather it is correct that some academics decide when a word is real or not. It's all very strange. I very much enjoy it as a discussion.", "It just sounds uneducated. Like \"aint\". People lose points in my head when they use these. Of course, at the bar, who cares, I'm not trying to put on my monocle or anything, but I won't take anything they say seriously, or at face value.", "My linguistics professor in college was from the deep south. He could switch into and out of his native accent at the drop of a hat... One minute he would some like a generic midwestern college-educated man, and the next an Appalachian redneck.\n\nOne of the first things he did in class was to explain the concept of descriptive grammar verses prescriptive grammar. Essentially, modern linguistics focuses more heavily on *descriptive* studies, which is approaching the language the way it actually is used, not how some arbitrary \"authority\" at some point in time decided it should forevermore be.  And increasingly this is coming to, once again, shape what we understand as the \"proper\" form of the language.\n\nCase in point: \"Ain't ain't in the dictionary\" ain't true, and hasn't been for quite a while now. Nor is it in any way a modern word - it goes back centuries, and has actually evolved over time like the rest of our language. But with the rise of the prescriptivists in the 1700 and 1800s among the educated middle class, there was a push to establish a single, objectively \"correct\" version of the language... And it was heavily, heavily classist. The elite could do whatever they wanted, but the middle class needed a way to feel superior to the lower, mostly poorly educated lower classes, so they basically decided to make certain things off limits - rules against them were taught, and failing to follow those rules marked someone as lesser and uneducated.\n\nIt was the 19th century academic equivalent of people who sit on HOA boards. Not actually wealthy or powerful themselves, but wrapping themselves in a shroud of self-declared rules that they see as setting themselves above the rabble. \n\nExactly as you're doing here. Exactly as continues to this day. Despite the word being in dictionaries, those dictionaries are quick to say \"but it shouldn't be used in formal usage\", or similar provisos. \n\nWhich still doesn't make it wrong, even at that. Sure, don't use it when you're writing a college thesis or something, but if someone uses it in casual conversation, *even by the rules* that is not incorrect.\n\nOf course, I could get into a much longer rant about how uneducated doesn't mean less intelligent, but I think I'm conveying well enough what I think about dismissing people's opinions or ideas because of their word usage.", "If I may suggest: Caden possibly comes from Caiden of gaelic language origin Cad\u00e1in. Its most likely old english or anglo saxon so has certainly been around for some time.", "When you\u2019ve been called something for 17+ years, I think most people would prefer to keep that name over a middle name never used.", "Why the hell would they not prefer the name they\u2019ve gone by for years?", "Dude, there are some bad takes and you\u2019re gunning for the crown today", "Wow. For the record, that is no less crazy of them than if you were 47.\n\nJust for interest; my girlfriend decided when she was 14 that she didn\u2019t like her name and was going to go with something else that she made up. Her parents went along with it. So yeah, it\u2019s you who decides to change your name, not them. \n\nStart calling your parents something else. Like Grandma and Grandpa or something.", "yeah its giving me narc vibes honestly, and its even weirder that the grandparents are going along with it.

There are hundreds of millions of you, it's difficult to generalise without stepping on a few toes, that's my bad. However from a UK perspective most of us would view that as an Americanism. I'll phrase it differently in the future or use a different example though, you're right.", "Okay, Beauregard", "Glad to see Bertha fall out of favor.", "That\u2019s all they should need to hear. They\u2019re being extremely disrespectful of you personal agency. Just ignore them. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019re going to stop. I\u2019m sorry, OP! Obviously NTA and I hate that you have to deal with this madness.", "I had a student a few years ago with a Chinese name that I was unfamiliar with.

Perfect.", "Heros!", "Chalupa Batman I would understand lmao", "That was my first thought as well.", "I had the exact same thought", "I go by my middle name because I am a junior. I did not choose to, my parents did. I fucking hate going by middle name. It might seem small but having to correct people out in the world or just go by my first name with them sucks. It has also caused administration issues while starting two different jobs. If I weren't disabled now, I'd change my legal name to get rid of my first name.\n\n\n\nAs for OPs name, nobody is going to give a shit about a name unless it is some weird hippy shit. It really makes me wonder what their real motivation is. Who was OP and their brother named after? It is just so weird for parents to act that way with such innocuous names. It's not like his name is Unicorn Glitter or Gary.", "not an english major: idgaf if it\u2019s a word. this is reddit, not the sats, what\u2019s important is that people understand you when you write. fed up with people derailing threads with grammar and spelling: you know what they were saying, so respond to that.", "My husband and I just met a woman named Claire Bennet.

My dad officially \u201cAmericanized\u201d his first name in his 40\u2019s. He wanted it to match all his other documents in life.
