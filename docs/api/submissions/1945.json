I don\u2019t really know why I said no other than I really just did not want to give her it.\n2) I didn\u2019t really have a good reason to not give her it, as I stated before. I just was kinda flustered and told her that it might be fraud. I\u2019m really doubting myself because she shouldn\u2019t have been banned and I want to help her out because it\u2019s not fair, but the only way I can help is to let her use my ID, which I\u2019m pretty against.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It sounds like a good way to get banned on TikTok yourself.", "NTA\n\nAnd am I the only one thinking that there are TONS if underage kids on tik tok whose accounts havent been banned? Why do I think there is more to the banned account story than just age? I mean maybe. I dont tik tok. But I have also seen kids as young as five making videos so......", "NTA.

So many reasons (legal, etc.) not to engage in fraud!!!!!  Don't give in.", "NTA. TikTok would have your license in their data base somewhere in China.", "NTA. Your sister needs to know a life without TikTok and it's definitely not worth your personal, legal documents.", "NTA - does she also expect you to give her your license when you're 21 so she can go to the bars?  They have this rule in place for a reason, and it will get you both in trouble if you're caught.", "NTA, don't do good things that look bad or bad things that look good. This is fraud, and it's a bad thing", "Info: I thought you only had to be 13 for TikTok. Why isn't she using her ID? If she doesn't have one yet, has she reached out to TikTok for alternatives?", "NTA. You made a principle driven decision, stick to it.\n\nJust because someone tells you they would do nefarious activity for you doesn't make it suddenly ok for you to do the same nefarious activity.", "NTA why on Earth would you give TikTok your id", "Clearly NTA", "NTA.

Better watch your credit score in the future lol.", "NTA - 1) that\u2019d be fraud 2) TikTok is garbage brain rotting nonsense", "Not saying judgement, you know you're not wrong, and it's so obvious it didn't need to be asked.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Her story also makes no sense bc on tt \"underage\" means below 13...", "NTA I am 29 and someone reported my Tiktok account.  It has been a nightmare to get it unrestricted.  They don't ban you;  They just restrict it.  You can still post but your posts cannot be stitched, dowloaded, or commented on.  Also no pm for some reason.  I ended up making a second account and it got unrestricted after 2 months and about 10 times of sending MY DL!", "NTA. How is this even a question?", "NTA.

Only government, or if you're getting a job through one. You have no idea what they can do with it and to who they sell their data.", "I mean, I saw her phone and it clearly stated that this was an appeal for an underaged account. Thinking about it, I\u2019m not sure if it was for her account or a friends account. She\u2019s generally untrustworthy and I often say \u201cno\u201d to most things she asks even if they\u2019re reasonable (hence leading me to feel uneasy enough to make this post).", "I don\u2019t think so.

Untrustworthy people dont deserve trust. She has proven her character already.", "You're both underage, if you feel comfortable, I'd tell your parents so they can educate her on internet and personal document safety and make sure to always keep your license on you so she can't snag it later. When I first saw that tiktok required government issued ID for accessing adult content (which isn't allowed on the app anyway) and that they want it to appeal bans... nope. Don't trust online sources with insecure connections, who will not encrypt your data, and who sell personal information with something like that. It is *so* dangerous. If they get hacked or the wrong employee gets it, you're in a very unsafe position", "For your sister to show your license in order to get her account back that would mean that TikTok was have that license in their database once she give it to them on a screen shot.", "Please don't give them your license info even if your account gets banned. Make a new email and make a new account. I said in another comment but they absolutely do not encrypt that data and they (like most social media) sell personal information about you. If you're not paying for a product, that's because you *are* the product, and that means selling data or generating ad revenue (or both)", "If you help an under-age person get into bar you risk a hefty fine, if you trust tiktok with your identity you risk identity theft.
