I\u2019m paranoid and have a child in US public school so I bought one for her classroom (kindergarten). The teacher thought it was weird and I did have to fight the principal on it but ultimately I think they just appeased me by agreeing for it to be stored in the class supply closet. I think the pushback was because they couldn\u2019t just buy one for every class in the school and I agree it probably is over the top. \n\nThe problem is that I met some of the future 1st grade teachers at a school event and mentioned to one of them that whoever got my child in their class also got a 5x5 bulletproof blanket along with her. It got some laughs and good natured eye rolls but later, our principal came up to me and said, \u201cso I guess that blanket wasn\u2019t a classroom donation after all, huh?\u201d\n\nI got the impression he was annoyed with me and the whole situation. I did reply back that no technically it wasn\u2019t, I would be donating it every year to whatever class my daughter was in. The vice principal (also standing near me) made a somewhat snarky comment that whoever my child\u2019s future classmates are would be so lucky because they\u2019d be the safest in the school. \n\nI can tell they are annoyed with me and I feel like one of \u201cthose\u201d overbearing parents who makes life hell for schools but that\u2019s not my intention. Yes, I am going over the top on this one aspect of giving me peace of mind that there is some type of extra protection for my child while at school. I understand it\u2019s an unlikely event and that if a shooting did happen, the blanket might not even be accessible to her. It just makes me feel better. \n\nBut now I\u2019m wondering, is it shitty of me to remove it from the class and basically have the blanket follow my daughter through elementary school? Is the right thing to do just remove it from school completely if I can\u2019t buy one for every class she\u2019s in?", "created_utc": 1704337311, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18y2h07/aita_for_taking_an_item_i_donated_to_my_childs/", "score": 217, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your intention was for it to follow your daughter, you should have presented it as that. \u201cI bought this bulletproof blanket for my daughter because I would like her to have access to this in case of emergency.\u201d That way it makes sense to take it back at the end of the year. Also, it comes off a bit pretentious to bring it up the way you did in front of the other teachers. You\u2019re kind of making a joke out of the fact that you can afford to give YOUR kid/her class extra protection and that the other classes are shit out of luck because they cant afford it. I\u2019m sure that most teachers in the US are paranoid about these things daily; so its a bit insensitive to make a joke that anyone who DOESN\u2019T get your daughter as a student is now less prepared if a tragic event happens. YTA", "So what\u2019s supposed to happen during the shooting? The teacher is supposed to go grab the blanket and put it in your child only and then the rest of them go hide in a corner?

I have a hard time believing this is even real.", "INFO - when the principal finally agreed to let you store the blanket in the classroom, did you disclose that the blanket would follow your child from class to class throughout her time at the school?", "The quotes around \"donated\" tell it all. If you said you donated it, then don't try to take it back. If you buy stuff for the classroom it belongs to the classroom. Would you take back art supplies, for example?

Four, maybe five kids fit under it, and that\u2019s only if it magically appears from the closet in the absolute chaos of an active shooter.

How is that going to work out for her socially? Already the adults are furious, wait till all the kids hate your child.\n\nThis has to be fake. YTA", "YTA\n\nI am a public school counselor in the US. If a parent  says they're donating something to the school/classroom, theen the expectation is that the school gets to decide what to do with it. You shouldn't have called it a donation. There are policies and procedures in place in the event of an active shooter. Your child's teacher is not going to forego the district's policies to drag out your blanket. I'm sure the teacher resents having to store that thing in her supply closet.", "YTA. Wtf are you doing? You realize no teacher or administrator is going to know how to use that blanket in time for an active shooting right? Too much liability.", "Take it back, get it made into a poncho and force your kid to wear it everyday. Your kid\u2019s \u201csafe\u201d, you don\u2019t have your worry, and no awkward take backs of donations. \n\nYTA btw. Seek help, that level of anxiety is affecting your life.", "YTA. Its not a donation if its contingent on your child\u2019s presence", "Why did you donate something that is just a burden to the school and the teachers?  The way to do this kind of donation properly is to donate enough to cover every classroom AND cover the training the teachers would need to make such a donation useful and not a super expensive paperweight they\u2019ll toss in a corner and probably not even use if an emergency does come up\u2026 because it\u2019s not in their training and may not even be a part of \u201cbest practices.\u201d\n\nObviously what I\u2019m suggesting here is super expensive and probably not something you individually can afford.  But if there is actually utility in these bulletproof blankets and you want the school to have them AND BE READY TO USE THEM IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY, you HAVE to do this the right way.  So: join the PTA.  Talk to whoever coordinates emergency preparedness for the school and see if these blankets are a recommended component of school safety protocols.  If they are, spearhead a fundraiser and make it so that all the classrooms have them AND the teachers are actually trained in proper use.\n\nIf you did that, you\u2019d be a superstar.  As it is, you\u2019re being selfish and unhelpful.  Imagine being the teacher who has to deal with colleagues and other kids dead because she was able to use a protective item not afforded to everyone.

It makes you sound so much worse taking back your potentially life saving donation like damn.", "Yta, it sounds like you fought to get them to accept the donation and now you're trying to take it back so it goes with your daughter. \n\n>I did have to fight the principal on it but ultimately I think they just appeased me by agreeing for it to be stored in the class supply closet\n\nYou probably had to fight them on it because they knew it wasn't a real donation. I understand your concerns and they are valid. Taking back such a substantial donation however is not.", "I mean. Yeah kinda YTA for being a PITA for school administration and being a demanding parent who is acting like their child is more precious than all the rest. Calling it a donation in any form is false.", "Teacher don\u2019t get pay enough. YTA", "YTA. I'm a school administrator in the US and handle the disaster plan for our school. Teachers need to follow their disaster protocol exactly as issued by the district. Any deviation can be a liability and distracts from what we practice in drills. Even if your kid's teacher adjusted their drill protocol to include this blanket, it causes the other students to learn the drill protocols incorrectly, putting them at risk when they're in another classroom next year.\n\nI'm honestly shocked that the school accepted the blanket. If a parent told me they wanted to donate a $5k item from a random unknown vendor, my first step would be contacting the district. Risk Management would need to clear the item as being appropriate for campus-use, and Finance would need to do paperwork on the donation since it's such a high cost. That doesn't even take into account the fact that the school now needs to maintain, store, and prevent theft of such an expensive item. \n\nSchool shootings are a terrifying thought, and everyone who works at schools/districts wants to keep students safe. I guarantee that your school has detailed safety and disaster plans. It may put you at ease to request a meeting with your school's principal or VP so they can explain the measures that the school already has in place to protect your student.", "YTA\n\nIf you donate something to the school they get to choose how it\u2019s used.  End of story", "YTA.\n\nI mean, I understand what you want and agree with the idea of you wanting a bulletproof blanket with your child, but you can't have any of those ones. You donated it to the school, so now it is theirs. I mean, imagine Jeff Bazos donated 10 million to charity, and just decided to take it away the next week.", "I think your wording was wrong. If you donate it, it means the school can use it as they see fit. If you want it to stay with your daughter, you should\u2019ve made it clear from the start. It was an AH move to force the school to \u201caccept your donation\u201d and then expecting them to move it every year.", "YTA. It\u2019s either a donation and they have complete control (e.g. the principle can keep it in their office) or it\u2019s not a donation and they have the right to refuse it being there. Donations that come with stipulations are the very reason they were hesitant to accept it in the first place. What\u2019s going to happen if there is a school shooting and your kid gets left out of the 5x5 blanket but other kids get saved by it? Or what happens if the teacher throws it on your kid and every other kid in the class dies?  Like, we are all scared about this terrifying event happening to our kid, but this is just messed up.  $5000 could have gone to providing the whole school with much needed resources that would have improved the lives of all the kids and lowered the risk of a shooting. \n\nJust buy your kid a bulletproof backpack and be done with it.  Don\u2019t tell anyone that it\u2019s bulletproof. Either donate the blanket with no expectations or remove it.", "YTA. \n\nYou are one of those overbearing parents. Don\u2019t be surprised if the school sends it home. I would. \n\nBecause you are creating an uneven playing field at the school. And if there is a shooter, and your child isn\u2019t under that blanket then what? What if your child is on the school oval at the time? What if there isn\u2019t room under the blanket for 22 little children (it\u2019s 5x5 right?) \u2026 does your child cower under a big very very heavy blanket alone or with a friend? Which friend? Nothing like asking a teacher to expose themselves by having to work out how to hang a huge arse heavy blanket over a door or window while they are trying to wrangle a classroom full of frightened children\u2026 etc etc etc.   \n\n\nYour donation wasn\u2019t a class one. It\u2019s a personal item for your daughter in your mindset. If (heaven forbid) your daughter is in a classroom and it\u2019s not protected her\u2026 will you sue them for that? Because they didn\u2019t use it correctly? Because it didn\u2019t protect YOUR daughter?   \n\n\nIf your child is more special than all the children\u2026 homeschool her. Or provide the same level of protection for all the chidlren. YTA.", "YTA. For so many reasons.", "YTA. That blanket is doing nothing in the storage closet other than getting glue and marker leaked on it. It is not part of the school or teacher\u2019s safety plan and would not even be taken out of the closet in an emergency. \n\nYou basically threw away 5k that could have been put to much better use as a cash donation.", "Why are you telling the 1st grade teachers that whichever classroom gets your child also gets the blanket? Do you think that's an incentive making every teacher want your child? You sound very entitled.", "YTA once you donate it, it\u2019s no longer your property and you do not dictate that it stays with your child.", "Amber is that you? \n\nA donation is not something that gets taken back by you after it has served your purpose.", "I don't think you're an ah for moving the blanket from class to class, but I think it was unwise to call it a donation. The school may also be annoyed because they have to take responsibility for your $5000 item. That is a big responsibility. Stuff gets stolen from classrooms all the time.", "Essentially, what you\u2019re doing is less of a donation and more of a child specific demand that the blanket follow your daughter through school. \n\nYou need to stop calling it a donation.

Does it matter to you if it makes the kids who aren't in her class and therefore aren't worthy of protection feel better?

If you can afford a $5000 blankie then you can probably also afford to send your kid to a private school, who would likely be far better equipped to deal with this BS. Or better yet, homeschool. Problem solved.", "YTA \n\nYou donated it to the school... It belongs to them. If you wanted to have one specifically for your daughter, maybe you should have given her one to keep with her personally.", "YTA. Why don't you organise a fundraising drive so every classroom can have one? What's going to happen when she gets to high school, the risk increases, and she can't literally drag this thing between classes? Think bigger. And kinder.", "YTA. It was never a donation, it was always for your daughter. A damn 5x5 blanket isn\u2019t going to protect more than a few kids. It\u2019s not even useful for the entire class. And logistically it is ridiculous. If they don\u2019t do drills with the blanket it won\u2019t be part of the emergency plan. It will cause confusion and more panic as only a few kids can try to fit under the blanket while everyone else is doing the emergency active shooter plan. My husband teaches active shooter training drills and it\u2019s very important that everyone works together when an emergency happens. If you\u2019re not all on the same page it causes chaos. I get it, I have a kid in kindergarten and 1st grade. It\u2019s scary these days. But this blanket is causing drama and at the end of the day the only purpose it serves has nothing to do with the kids. It is for your own anxiety.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s not a donation if you take it back. I can understand the need to keep your child safe but the way you\u2019re going about it is not normal. I feel like you outright lied and told the principal it was a \u201cdonation\u201d so you can get your way. Stop treating these classrooms like a storage locker. If you\u2019re that worried about school shootings, look into homeschooling your child and seek therapy for yourself.", "YTA. You asked for a major policy exception, pitched a fit, and ultimately they made an exception. It was kindergarten, you were anxious, every parent has been there. But now you've notified them that you intend to try and force this issue *every single year*. Of course they're upset. Every parent thinks their child is the most important child in the world. But every child in the school deserves the same protections, and that's why protocols for active shooter scenarios are in place. At the end of the day, we as parents have to make the decision to let them out of our sight or not - with the understanding that anything can happen if we do. It's absolutely terrifying, but that's what we sign up for.\n\nIf you have this kind of money to throw around, consider a private school, a large donation to any number of organizations working to make schools safer, or talking to the school in a more productive way about what you can offer to help make *all* the kids safer. Work *with* your child's educators, not against them.", "Slight YTA because you should have known better than to call it a \u201cdonation\u201d. That\u2019s something you give away and then have no control over, which was never your intention. You\u2019re not \u201cdonating\u201d it to each classroom your daughter is in. You\u2019re asking that it be stored there. \n\nIf you want to clear things up, explain that you misspoke (because you did). The blanket is intended to follow your daughter and be stored in her primary classroom each year. You intentionally fought the wrong fight with the principal, and now are just doing what you originally intended, so yeah, that\u2019s annoying for everyone else that isn\u2019t you. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s awesome that you advocate for your child. Do that!! Just do it remembering that American educators are not the enemy. If you want to push back against something to make your daughter\u2019s classroom safer, push back against the actual problem: absurdly lax gun laws that protect the sale and ownership of firearms and send thoughts and prayers to the families of dead children. Tell the principal that you want to store the blanket in your daughter\u2019s classroom in the meantime.", "Putting quotation marks around the word donation is quite telling. \n\nYTA. The word \u2018donation\u2019 or \u2018donate\u2019 is not synonymous with loan. The fact that you fought for it to be stored in the class, never saying it\u2019ll be moved, and now expect them to \u2018understand\u2019 it was never a donation, just for your child, makes you the word type of parent there is to deal with as a teacher. YOUR child deserves special treatment - this isn\u2019t a donation, YOU expect to deserve storage space in a classroom.", "YTA. This is pretty ridiculous. You told them you were donating it in order to get it into the classroom and then reneged on the situation, reclaiming the donation to transfer it to your daughter's next class. Your daughter is part of a group, and you are setting her apart in a way that is unnatural and inappropriate in such a setting. This is something that you may be able to ultimately get away with based solely on the leniency of the administration, but you are absolutely making yourself an asshole in doing so.", "YTA. As others have said, if you take it back, it's not a donation.\n\nYou're also being a bit weird/overbearing. I get the feeling that this is about an anxiety of yours. I think that trying to exert control over every aspect of your daughter's life isn't really going to fix the anxiety problem, and really that's what you should be working on.\n\n> I can tell they are annoyed with me and I feel like one of \u201cthose\u201d overbearing parents who makes life hell for schools but that\u2019s not my intention.\n\nIt doesn't matter a lot what your *intention* is, what matters is the *effect* you have. You're being overbearing. Maybe look at your behavior and adjust your intention to be more in line with the effect you want to have.", "So, the teacher of that class is supposed to take time from protecting the entire class to get your kid a special blanket (that can shield a couple of kids at best) out from whatever closet it is in while being threatened with bullets in a hypothetical situation? Just to be sure I understand. So instead of following protocol, you envision a teacher getting your magic blankie out to shield your child?", "It sounds like you'd be better off getting your kid one of those bullet proof backpacks or a bulletproof vest to wear everyday.", "Going with YTA because you have created more drama with your use or misuse of words in this situation. You said you donated it to the classroom but now want it to go to your child's future classrooms as they age. That's not a donation but a loan or best case gift with strings. There's a difference between a donation, a loan and a gift with strings attached. You know this or should know it as an adult and parent.", "YTA are you serious right now?", "Yeah, YTA. Also You're The Idiot, and probably a small-minded Asshole, for thinking classroom gun violence is actually the problem in the US.\n\nDo you know what guns kids die from the most and where? Handguns and at home. The thing is, we don't care because those kids aren't white and precious.", "As soon as the VP snarked about your daughter's class would be the safest in the school, you should have told him all the classrooms should be safe but, unfortunately, he'd rather get into a snit than find a solution.\n\nMy grandkids have to wonder if they'll need either a bulletproof backpack, or an insert that fits inside one they already have. I honestly did not know that was an actual thing, but it is and it shows the state of the US schools. No, let me correct myself. It shows the state of the US.\n\nAll that aside, you did slide into AH territory by not explicitly telling them that the item was for that class, for that year. Hedging around the phrasing only made you sound entitled, and now your daughter will have to carry the burden of the fallout for the rest of the time she's at that school.\n\nSo yeah, YTA. Not for doing whatever is necessary to ensure your child's best chance of survival, should an active shooter event occur, but for the way you went about it.\n\nMaybe next time meet with the school administrators and work on getting grant funding for items to help all the kids in an active shooter situation. I mean, if they can have an active shooter bucket in every classroom, surely there's money out there for items to help fortify the glass and doors.", "Isn't a donation an intent on giving money or goods to the betterment or help of others.?  \n\nYou lend or you give or you donate.

I\u2019m paranoid and have a child in US public school so I bought one for her classroom (kindergarten). The teacher thought it was weird and I did have to fight the principal on it but ultimately I think they just appeased me by agreeing for it to be stored in the class supply closet. I think the pushback was because they couldn\u2019t just buy one for every class in the school and I agree it probably is over the top. \n\nThe problem is that I met some of the future 1st grade teachers at a school event and mentioned to one of them that whoever got my child in their class also got a 5x5 bulletproof blanket along with her. It got some laughs and good natured eye rolls but later, our principal came up to me and said, \u201cso I guess that blanket wasn\u2019t a classroom donation after all, huh?\u201d\n\nI got the impression he was annoyed with me and the whole situation. I did reply back that no technically it wasn\u2019t, I would be donating it every year to whatever class my daughter was in. The vice principal (also standing near me) made a somewhat snarky comment that whoever my child\u2019s future classmates are would be so lucky because they\u2019d be the safest in the school. \n\nI can tell they are annoyed with me and I feel like one of \u201cthose\u201d overbearing parents who makes life hell for schools but that\u2019s not my intention.

I understand it\u2019s an unlikely event and that if a shooting did happen, the blanket might not even be accessible to her. It just makes me feel better. \n\nBut now I\u2019m wondering, is it shitty of me to remove it from the class and basically have the blanket follow my daughter through elementary school? Is the right thing to do just remove it from school completely if I can\u2019t buy one for every class she\u2019s in?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

What I hate to tell you is the blanket is performative security. If it\u2019s on the outside of the door, the shooter will take it down then shoot the lock out. If it\u2019s on the inside then vice versa. The best thing you can do for your child is teach her to hide. This is why I\u2019m an advocate for teachers receiving (first, mental health screenings for days or weeks to ensure their competency) but two, receiving extensive firearm training followed by a concealed carry. Most school security are fat men in the 60s. Cops will be too late. Teachers need to be able to defend their students. Until then it\u2019s unfortunate but children will continue to die.

Because taking guns from good guys leaves them defenseless against bad guys who\u2019d never give up their weapons. We need better security protocols for our kids. Locked gates during school hours that can\u2019t be climbed. Not just one sign in office but multiple stationed through all entrances. A security officer not just lazing about in an office but patrolling the school during all hours of operation, etc. we need to do better by our kids. Soft YTA because you\u2019re trying to defend your child but I hate to say it\u2019s performative and this blanket won\u2019t save your child.
