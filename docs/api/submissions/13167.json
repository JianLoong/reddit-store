They recognise that cat calling is harassment and can be frightening. Although sexual harassment is already illegal in England and Wakes, the bill aims to improve enforcement and targets street harassment.\n\nThe fact that the bill is being passed by the non liberal conservatives party shows that even conservatives in the UK recognise regarding cat calling is not a compliment, that is distressing and that is not ok. And that \u2018boy\u2019s will be boys\u2019 is a stupid justification for bad behaviour that should not be tolerated. \n\nThis closes a loophole in the law, as it has never has been a specific criminal offence to harass and intimidate intentionally a woman or a girl in public, because it is not a specific crime, too many woman and girls think there is no point in reporting it to the police.
