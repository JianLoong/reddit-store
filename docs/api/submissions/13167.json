They recognise that cat calling is harassment and can be frightening. Although sexual harassment is already illegal in England and Wakes, the bill aims to improve enforcement and targets street harassment.\n\nThe fact that the bill is being passed by the non liberal conservatives party shows that even conservatives in the UK recognise regarding cat calling is not a compliment, that is distressing and that is not ok.
