When I went in my room, I heard him talking smack about me in the kitchen about how I can never have a conversation like an adult because I always get upset.

That's the conditioned misogyny that we need to fight. We need to stop normalizing this behavior. If I were your dad, I'd be in my car at that store and confronting them. It's sexual harassment. Plain and simple.", "NTA.\n\nYou have every right to be upset. Your dad is trivialising it, because \"boys will be boys\". Yes, boys will continue to be boys if their awful behaviour is enabled by people unwilling to act about it.\n\nAlso the premise that an adult conversation has no space for people being upset or expressing their feelings is...simply wrong. Your dad has probably described women as being \"too emotional\" many times in his life.", "NTA.\n\n\"Dad, it may have been different in your time, but nowadays, men are supposed to be used to the sight of a woman in sports wear.

I enjoyed getting dressed up and looking nice for ME( yes seems weird to say for that timeframe, but that is me), and never felt good about having a random stranger catcall me. I was VERY lucky. My parents were very understanding and stuck by me. You were upset about being harassed and surely could have gotten support from both parents. You don\u2019t state your age, but an older man doing this to a young woman is even more gross. The fact they are employees of a store and doing this? Worse. I would contact corporate and let them know. It sounds harsh and I don\u2019t like to see people get in trouble BUT this is sexual harassment NOT anything but.", "NTA\n\nYour father's definition of adulthood - a mindset in which a person accepts inappropriate behavior and sexual harassment because they considers it normal and believes that it cannot be changed, so it is not worth trying or fighting for yourself.", "Your dad's a fucking asshole!!!!

Easier to make her the over-emotional person.\nMy Mum downplayed anything similar because if it was real, then she would need to worry about and couldn't change anything. Better to make me the over emotional one.", "NTA I'm pretty sure every state has their workers go through mandatory sexual harassment training. What they did was wrong, against the law, and against their training. If you feel up to it you can go back and report it. Hell it might even be on camera! Your father didn't handle the convo well either. This is an upseting topic. It would be odd if you didn't get upset discussing it! Please don't be discouraged. What you went through was not right on any level.", "NTA Your dad is in the wrong. He defending their gross behavior because he hasn't maturedd enough to understand we can hold \"young men\" accountable for their inappropriate behavior. It's more than reasonable to expect not to be harassed when in public.  Time for your dad to grow up.", "NTA\n\nYour dad basically told you men are pigs.  Boys will be boys - so get over it. \n\nIt's people like your dad that perpetuate  the blanket disrespect for women in society.   If you look sexually appealing you're fair game for any ignorant comments or whistles men want to spew.    If you're not sexually appealing you're fair game for insults and degradation.   \n\nI'd report the bozos.", "ESH \n\nSometimes when we talk to people, we aren\u2019t looking for a solution, we just want to be heard. \n\nYour dad was wrong: it\u2019s not ok. In his mind you were wanting a solution (which he can\u2019t provide) so when you view it from his perspective I do kind of understand his frustration. \n\nI think your dad probably had a point though in general, about you getting upset all the time. You listened into there conversation and through a tantrum like a child.

This would be overlooked 5 years ago but everyone is too soft. You poor thing, you were looked at in a grocery store and commented on. Did the bad man touch you?  Will you need years of therapy?  God you all are so overly sensitive. Just ignore and walk away. I agree with your parents so yeah, I changed my mind and will change it to Your the too Sensitive A**hole. You all are.

It is very helpful \u2764\ufe0f", "So how's the restraining order going?", "In the UK they are currently putting a bill through parliament that will make make street sexual harassment a crime carrying a jail sentence of up to two years.  Catcalling, following someone or blocking their path will become an offence in England and Wales under a bill backed by the government. They recognise that cat calling is harassment and can be frightening. Although sexual harassment is already illegal in England and Wakes, the bill aims to improve enforcement and targets street harassment.\n\nThe fact that the bill is being passed by the non liberal conservatives party shows that even conservatives in the UK recognise regarding cat calling is not a compliment, that is distressing and that is not ok. And that \u2018boy\u2019s will be boys\u2019 is a stupid justification for bad behaviour that should not be tolerated. \n\nThis closes a loophole in the law, as it has never has been a specific criminal offence to harass and intimidate intentionally a woman or a girl in public, because it is not a specific crime, too many woman and girls think there is no point in reporting it to the police. This is something we don't tolerate for racial harassment or harassment on the grounds of sexuality.\n\nYour dad is ignorant and sexist and enabling bad behaviour. If he can\u2019t understand why this is not ok ask him if he would he tolerate that behaviour towards himself or your mum, or his mum for that matter, or for a son he had that was 20 years old who was being harassed in the street for no reason (because this is what this behaviour is- harassment). Or maybe show him this thread.\n\nAnd by the way, you didn\u2019t have to comment on what you were wearing, what you were wearing has nothing to do with this disgusting behaviour.\n\nIf you have the mental energy I would also encourage you to report the 2 members of staff to their manager. \n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65065154"]}
