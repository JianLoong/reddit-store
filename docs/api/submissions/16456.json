For others, perfume is just perfume, they pick something they think smells nice and it isn't a big deal.\n\nI'm more on your side of the aisle. I very much like having a unique scent. I actually spend time finding body sprays and colognes that blend well together so that I can have a unique scent that can't be easily duplicated.\n\nYour girlfriend is obviously on the other side of the aisle and doesn't see why this is a big deal. I don't think she's an asshole for that but this is one of those relationship situations where you just might have to take the time to explain why exactly this is important to you. It's possible, maybe even likely, that she'll never understand why it is important. But if she truly cares about you, hopefully that will supercede that lack of understanding.

He cannot talk to you by saying \"I'm not going to let you keep using that perfume.\" He cannot tell you what perfume you're allowed to use, and if he asks you to change and you decline, that's the end of what he gets to say about it.", "> He doesn't get to demand I change the scent, of course\n\nOP raised the issue with her SO, SO declined to stop using the scent. OP then tried to demand. \n\nBut also, this isn't because it smells like OP's mother. This isn't because OP has bad associations with it, it's because OP doesn't want other people to have associations with the smell for anyone but her! It's outrageous!!!!", "Eh, I'm more just talking about understanding that some sensory inputs can cause an undesired emotional reaction, and there are societal norms around avoiding that when reasonable.", "This is so weird.", "NTA. Its fine if couples want to share but also if one or both wants their own scent. Igy, scent is personal.", "NAH. Take her perfume shopping.", "NTA your gf is selfish and if she likes the scent she need to replace yours that she have been using and buy her own. Perfume is an extension of you so if you found the one you love you don\u2019t have to share. And your gf is an user it\u2019s the little signs like this that really shows who a person is \n\nI don\u2019t share my scents with anybody.", "YTA\n\njust a perfume, no one really cares what you are using and if anyone rlse using it, wouldnt you like you gf smell good to?", "YTA", "NTA solely because your bottle is your personal property.\n\nBut you don\u2019t own a scent (as a product). They sell literally tens of millions of units of the most popular scents ever year, and even most successful niche and indie perfumeries will sell several thousand of everything they make. Please let go of the idea that, to be your signature scent, no one else can wear it?", "Info: if she went and bought a bottle of the same scent, would you have a problem with it? \n\nYour answer to that question determines whether you are in the wrong or not. If this is purely about her using something you spent your hard earned money and not reimbursing you, then no you wouldn\u2019t be an AH. \n\nBut if she went out and bought a bottle for herself and you were still mad about it, then you would be an AH. You can\u2019t bogart a scent all to yourself.", "Scents most often bring back the strongest memories of all - NTA", "YTA\n\nIt's a *good* thing that your gf likes the scent enough to wear it herself.  If she didn't like it, she might not be able to tolerate being around it (and therefore you).\n\nPlus, in all likelihood, she's not as neurotic as you are about having a \"signature scent\" (because that's weird), and will move on to a different favorite scent in her own time.  Sharing the same favorite fragrance in the meantime shouldn't be something you draw lines in the sand over.", "ESH. Your gf shouldn't use your expensive perfume without your permission. You wanting a 'signature scent' is very main character syndrome.", "Happily married for 45 years and we figured out early on that your partner doesn\u2019t get to decide what is or isn\u2019t a big deal to you; that\u2019s your call.  NTA", "NTA for not wanting to share since you bought it however if she buys her own YTA if you would have an issue with her using it", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA. My mom has worn the same perfume every day of her life, it\u2019s 100% become her \u201cscent\u201d to the point where all of our family just associate that perfume with her. Idk it\u2019s kind of old fashioned but I personally love the idea that there\u2019s this scent that the people who love my mom will always remember her by. \n\nI think if you have explained the sentimental/emotional reasons why this is important to you, and your partner still doesn\u2019t get it, then to me it\u2019s not really about the perfume anymore.", "NTa you had a very valid reason in asking her not to use it. She should have respected it. There\u2019s a lot of perfumes out there, she can find her own", "YTA for trying to gatekeep a perfume scent.  N T A for not wanting to share and for wanting her to purchase her own bottle to use.", "NTA, as it's your perfume and she is taking advantage of your kindness.", "My mother had a signature scent and I was very happy to find a full bottle of it after she passed. OP has already explained the same thing. There\u2019s no need to be an asshole about it.", "Yes, OP\u2019s definitely NTA for not wanting girlfriend to use their expensive fragrance, but if it\u2019s a standard commercially available perfume then it would be totally fine for her to buy her own bottle (just not to keep using up OP\u2019s). You can\u2019t own something like Channel No. 5 any more than you can own wearing a particular brand of clothing or a certain color.\n\nIf the perfume is a custom blend that OP commissioned, that would be different and it *would* be kind of weird for girlfriend to wear it.", "I did the same thing in my early 20s, it\u2019s something women have had for decades, a signature scent. Nothing trendy or tiktok about it.", "Is a signature scent this far out of cultural memory already? This is a thing, has been for generations", "My mom always wore Chanel #5.  Because I associated the fragrance so strongly with her I never wore it or liked it on others.  when she became ill and was in intensive care, my sister and I doused ourselves in it (from her bottle) every day before we went to the hospital hoping that, even if she wasn\u2019t conscious, she would smell it and feel some comfort.  After she passed away, I took that bottle home. Ever since, although I like playing around and trying different scents for everyday, I wear Chanel #5 on special events because it reminds me of my mom.\n\nWhen my oldest son was in college he had a very traumatic event and I came to pick him up. My husband and I had been out the night before and I guess I still smelled a little of the Chanel. When I got there and gave him a big hug he buried his face in my neck and said how good it made him feel because I smelled like me to him. Now I always wear the Chanel when I\u2019m picking up or dropping off my boys at the airport or anything like that.\n\nFor 2 generations now that smells like \u201cMom.\u201d", "Idk, I have mixed feelings about this. Body chemistry affects how perfume smells on people. Like I gave my ex a bottle of perfume I had because it smelled much better on her than on me. Just because 2 women wear the same perfume doesn't mean they will smell the same. That said, I might be a bit miffed myself if I was OP, but I would probably let it go because it's a bit possessive. It's an odd situation for sure", "You don't have to bathe in perfume and other such things. It can be done in moderation where people smell it when you're close, not when you enter the room.\n\nPersonally I rarely wear my perfume anymore, but I do have a little roller version of a very light scent that smells amazing and is very suitable for day to day use. \n\nI like wearing a scent because it helps calm me when I feel upset. Or energize. There's a roller by Pacifica (I think) that has hints of pineapple and it's the best thing since sliced bread. Which reminds me I need to order it again.", "Plus if she likes it, she\u2019ll still smell it on her partner all the time so what\u2019s the big loss? I always give people scents I like because I still get to smell them that way lol.", "I have a fairly acute sense of smell and this made me tear up \u2014 what a lovely thing for your family! Thank you for sharing.", "my mom always wore shalimar (like every single day!) and after she died i found one of her monogrammed handkerchiefs and sprayed it with a good blast of her perfume. i keep it in a box and once a year or so i take it out to smell it & i'm immediately transported back to being a little girl sitting on her bed, watching her put on her make-up and give herself one last shalimar dab before heading out the door to go wherever it was she & dad were headed to that night.", "during my husband's deployments, he always spent the last couple of nights home wearing the same tshirt so that it would really smell like him. my cats would spend so much time laying on it while he was gone. it was so sweet & i know it must have helped them deal with him being gone.\n\nhe died a few years ago & one of my cats carries around the last tan tshirt he wore and sleeps on it all the time. it's got blood stains on it but i'm never washing that shirt. i want his smell to be on it for as long as possible.", "Depends on how it\u2019s applied. If OP and girlfriend both do the common (incorrect) \u201cspray a big cloud of perfume and then walk through it fully clothed\u201d then the scent will mostly be on their clothes and they\u2019ll smell the same. If they\u2019re applying it to skin, then there will be subtle differences (especially if OP is male and girlfriend is female - hormones can also change the way perfumes smell).", "It\u2019s not that dramatic a difference. I must have smelled Angel on 100 women throughout my life and it always smells like Angel.", "The same perfume in 1 person will smell different in someone else. It's all in a person's chemistry.", "But this isn\u2019t a random person, this is someone who they are in a relationship with. Who should respect them and understand where they are coming from.", "Approximately 2 seconds in any perfume/bodycare related community will absolutely refute that lol. Having a \u201csignature scent\u201d is a big thing in a lot of those circles!", "I agree completely!  I was expecting a lot of women to blast me for saying they shouldn't wear enough perfume to cause issues like you mentioned!  Thank you!", "Yup. I love Santal 33, but then one of my closest friends started wearing it. I find I can\u2019t wear it anymore \u2014 it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s just that I associate it with her rather than my own memories of it. Probably doesn\u2019t help either that I\u2019ve been in two different businesses that were using it as a room scent recently but you get the idea\u2026", "It's not the same perfume as her mom... she said she always remembered the scent of her moms perfume and wanted to find her own personal scent for people to remember her by.", "Exactly!"]}
