For others, perfume is just perfume, they pick something they think smells nice and it isn't a big deal.\n\nI'm more on your side of the aisle. I very much like having a unique scent. I actually spend time finding body sprays and colognes that blend well together so that I can have a unique scent that can't be easily duplicated.\n\nYour girlfriend is obviously on the other side of the aisle and doesn't see why this is a big deal. I don't think she's an asshole for that but this is one of those relationship situations where you just might have to take the time to explain why exactly this is important to you. It's possible, maybe even likely, that she'll never understand why it is important. But if she truly cares about you, hopefully that will supercede that lack of understanding.

I went through a handful of perfumes before I found one I liked enough to wear it every day for 6 years. It\u2019s true that none of them were instantly my signature scent\u2026 until I found the one that became it. It can just be a process to find the right one for you.", "\"It would be nice to not spoil something they wanted to be special\" is exactly it.", "Yeah! If that\u2019s what you use every day, there\u2019s more than likely someone in your life that associates it with you. I didn\u2019t even scroll that far and I\u2019ve already seen 4-5 other women who wear Chanel No. 5 or whose mothers wore it. There are probably millions of women wearing that perfume \u2014 it\u2019s supposedly the most popular perfume in the world \u2014 but it still makes me feel like I\u2019m 6 years old and my mom is hugging me, wearing a dress from a 90s sitcom and an 80s perm.", "Just another reason to never wear perfume or cologne, as if there needed to be more...", "Take your pick, either is preferable to acting like you get to control other people's choices.", "I am 65 a d only just realized I'm not a real adult because  I don't have a signature scent.\n\nWTF?", "YTA\u2014 Having a signature scent isn\u2019t a thing. Not everyone likes the smell of perfume, and I personally don\u2019t want to know what someone smells like unless they\u2019re my partner. Being mad that your gf of 4 years likes the same perfume as you seems like a weird hill to die on.", "NTA. \n\nYou bought it. I also understand wanting a signature scent that\u2019s different from everyone else, but this is your girlfriend..who would probably end up smelling like that anyway if you guys live together. \n\nIf she bought her own, would you still be mad?", "NTA. \n\nI'm sure this will get lost in the mix, but I sincerely do not think you're the A-hole.  Picking a signature scent is picking your ***own*** smell.  I think if partners share a signature scent, then it feeds too much into the melting-together of personalities/identities.  \n\nMy partner and I have our own scents, and then we have another fragrance that we share when we travel. \n\nYou're not immature or an asshole for this, and I think your girlfriend is being insensitive to you.  Having the same signature scent is much more than just wearing the same outfit at a party or something.", "NTA\n\nI think everyone who wears scents have a signature scent. And it\u2019s an important deal to people who like scents\u2014being uniquely yours in your own little ecosystem\n\nIt\u2019s worse that she didn\u2019t happen across by herself but saw that you liked and wanted it for herself. \n\nA scent is different than say a hobby. Like if you picked up painting and then she did, then you\u2019d be an AH. But if she started making replicas of your originals then she becomes an AH. \n\nShe probably just associates the perfume with you so that why she was so attracted to it to begin with. Sure she may like it on her own but in doubt she would have picked it for herself without influence from you. You went through 20. She can find another 20 or 200 out there to make her own honestly", "NTA. There\u2019s nothing wrong with having a signature scent. You also spent so much time trying to find this perfume, which I\u2019m sure your girlfriend was aware of. A lot of people are saying it\u2019s not a big deal but I find it incredibly rude and a little disrespectful to for her to freely use something that is so sentimental to you.\n\nI do agree with other commenters that it might be nice to try and help her find her own signature scent.", "NTA A signature scent loses its statement if someone else in your crew wears it. It's an obvious thing and she should know better. Tell her to go find her own.", "So this is more about her using what you bought, rather than you not wanting her to wear it?\n\nIf she bought her own bottle, it's fine?\n\nI think you've left this out on purpose to get N T A votes, I think in reality, you just don't want her wearing it. Period. So I'm going YTA.", "yta but not for not sharing (perfumes are so expensive). she can wear any scent she likes if she buys it and tbh probably thousands others do, too. i would be really excited if me & my gf smelled the same, so cute.", "YTA. Mid-twenties? You're acting like spoiled six-year-olds, (with apologies to kids)  Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Do you know how many millions of people are using YOUR \"signature scent\" right now?  But ooooohhh, you looked really hard in so many department stores to find it. Like shoppers everywhere. What are your values? Let her use it sometimes? Buy her a bottle of her own? Let her buy the next bottle? This is your girlfriend. You can certainly be alone if you would prefer to.", ">\tA signature scent is such a weird thing to want. \n\nNot really. Not anymore than not wanting someone to wear the exact outfits you choose. Or copy exactly how you talk or wear your hair. It\u2019s about style, self-expression.\n\nNot just that, but scent is heavily tied to emotion and memory. \n\nThere are SO many scents out there. This is a big deal to OP but not to OP\u2019s partner. If something is a big deal to my partner but not that important to me, I usually let them have it.

Weird stuff is important to me, too.", "It\u2019s true, but it won\u2019t smell the same on everyone; perfume reacts to your body chemistry.", "Sure but it\u2019s a mass produced fragrance. Hundreds of people wear it.", "She should help her partner find her own", "Yes, my dad use the same fragrance always, he pass away 10 years ago.

Because that smells like pencil shavings on me lol", "If I was OP\u2019s girlfriend, I would recognize that it meant a lot to her and let the scent be \u201cher\u201d thing.", "Yeah like sometimes I\u2019ll put on an outfit and realize that my girlfriend and I are too matchy-matchy, so I\u2019ll change. Sure, I have every right to wear whatever I want from my closet, but it makes her more comfortable when we don\u2019t look like twinsies.", "> Why is wearing this ... more important to her than making her partner happy?\n\nUsually lines like this are written in defense of controlling boyfriends.", "I disagree. Sometimes you can buy the same and it turns out the same. My personal body chemistry DESTROYS scents. They give you little tester cards to spritz and smell. That\u2019s the out of the bottle smell. 95% of perfume out there is either too strong for me to smell all day or my own chemistry ruins it. Oh, is that a light citrusy smell? Just kidding! On me it smells like fruit just starting to mold. Beautiful floral scent? Nope, just flowers dying in a vase that needed to be changed a week ago. Light woody aroma? hahahaha just kidding, grass clippings and sticks in a puddle that\u2019s also growing mosquitos. \n\nAll that to say sometimes people smell AMAZING with their chosen scents, and they have a personal mix in with it.", "literally any random person CAN go out and buy it in a store, unless you\u2019re making your own.", "Oh interesting! Maybe that\u2019s another one I should check out haha! This one is Missing Person by Phlur.", "I use Lili Bermuda, they have a lot of scents, they\u2019re divine. The other is an Annick Goutal scent.

They have a \u201cif I like it I\u2019m wearing it\u201d mentality which is really inconsiderate. Some scents make me feel nauseous", "with cheap scents, no. you're right. but if this is a quality fragrance like it seems, it will smell differently on two different people. my brother and i wear the same cologne and it absolutely smells differently on both of us.", "OK, my Dad used to work in Paris regularly, He would bring my mother and I back scents based on the recommendations of the sales lady at the Perfumerie.\n\nNow, he didn't buy us the same scents, but I gotta tell you, if Mom and I used each others' perfumes, they smelled different on each of us.\n\nJust fyi", "I made this mistake\u2026 bought a cologne that my dad had when I was a kid. The bottle was real old fashioned looking and I liked the smell.  First time he wore it we went out to dinner and it was nice but soon after we got home and started the mattress dancing I was like ..ahhhh NOPE, you gotta shower this is too weird smelling my dad right now", "My husband told me that he hated the perfume that I wore for like a decade\u2026My \u201csignature scent\u201d if you will lol.  After a freaking decade he tells me!  I was pissed (more so that he waited so long to even say anything) but told him to take me out shopping for something he liked.  He said he associated that smell with some pretty horrible shit that happened to both of us and when it was over my perfume reminded him of all the bad times.  Scents do hold memories for a lot of people.  I totally got what he meant by it, for me the bad scent was church incense.", "OP, if you want a truly personal scent, you need to find someone who can help you create it. I do not know how you would go about that. I lucked into it. Walked into a store while on vacation and walked out with a completely unique scent that I absolutely love. No one else will ever wear this exact formula. Unfortunately, that store has closed & the proprietor moved & semi-retired. I can still get more by mail via her website, but she doesn't have the customization service anymore. I can understand not wanting to share it, but you can't own a commercial scent, so it's kind of hard to say your partner can't wear it.", "nta. its your shit. shes not entitled to it", "NTA She is stealing your stuff. She is discounting your emotions. She is not a friend.", "NTA. Out of the literally millions of perfume in the world, she has now decided she needs to wear the one perfume you wear? Come on now.", "Look I get where you are coming from. I had to test so many perfumes to find ones that didn't make me sneeze and also had a scent profile I liked. It is a long process and since I found out that it's the more artisan creations that don't invoke sneezing very expensive. I think you might be more gentle and offer an alternative. Help her find her own scent. Especially since perfume smells slightly different on different people. She would most likely find something that she likes much better than yours. So NTA, but could have phrased it better.", "NTA, but if she buys the same one herself then? Then Sulking over it will be petty. If she decides to buy one herself, don't argue. Let her.", "NTA \n\nThis is what dating is about- finding ourselves, boundaries, and what kind of partner we want.", "YTA you're allowed not to share your bottle, you are not allowed to tell someone what scents they use.", "Perfume smells differently on different people. My sister has a perfume she wears a lot. I love it but if I wear it, it smells like cat piss. \nHonestly I think you\u2019re being a little silly. \nYTA", "NTA. I like to have my signature scent too & that would bother me. Plus I\u2019d want her to have her own scent that I can enjoy. Something different from my own.", "ESH. You for refusing to share perfume with your partner. Your partner for choosing to be parasitic rather than bringing anything to the table.", "Actually, I'm surprised a bit that the scent remains the same when applied to both of you.  Most labelled scents are identical when they are bottled and leave the perfumery but change slightly when applied to your skin because of your unique body chemistry.  That's why White Diamonds smells great on one person and like old coal on another.  NTA for wanting your own scent, but you should not have let her try it to start with.", "Nta", "NTA.   \n\n\nBut there\u2019s some BIG messages in this about your relationship with your GF.   \n\n\nFirstly you want a scent that has deep emotional attachment for yourself - fair enough! But your GF doens\u2019t have the same \u2018values\u2019 around this and is prepared to fight you on it. Problem! Are you able to get through difference of values issues?   \n\n\nSecondly  you don\u2019t want her to wear it because you want this scent to be associated with YOU. If she\u2019s going to be your life long partner, effectively if not literally your wife\u2026 can you not share? This is a line you are putting between you both that is about having an \u2018other\u2019 to her, and creating life long scent relationships with people, but not allowing her to be a unified unit with you. There\u2019s a gap, and you need to ponder that.", "That is amazing that he knows the difference!", "My granddaughters knew I was in the room before they saw me because I always wore Channel #5.

One point I'm trying to make is that sometimes we have to understand that things that aren't that important to us are actually pretty important to our loved ones. And we show our love for them by acknowledging the importance of those things to them, even if we don't quite get it.", "Maybe you can offer to help your girlfriend find her own scent? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to ask her not to use yours and it really shouldn\u2019t be a difficult compromise.

The hidden drawback of being lesbians with similar taste.", "Fortunately we live in a world of context and nuance!\n\nNavigating which compromises are reasonable to make with a partner (or just in general) and which are not is an important life skill. \n\nQuestion: Why don't you want me to wear this?\n\nControlling boyfriend answer: When you dress sexy, it makes me think that other men will pay attention to you. This makes me jealous and angry.  \nReasonable? No.\n\nProfessional spouse answer: Because we're attending a work function and my colleagues will judge us both by whether we're appropriately dressed. That's a very sexy outfit but it's just not appropriate for a formal work dinner and it could hurt my career.  \nReasonable? Yes.\n\nOP answer: I want to have a signature scent that no one else in our social circle wears so that when people smell it, they'll think of me. I have a lot of happy memories of other people in my life with signature scents and I spent a lot of time finding this one. If you wear it, it won't have that effect.  \nReasonable? Yes.\n\nZookeeper answer: Because we are doing a behind-the-scenes tour of the hyena enclosure and while a meat dress makes an important statement about the military-industrial complex, it's really not safe to wear around a group of predators, so I'm going to need you to change, Ms. Gaga.  \nReasonable? Yes.", "My mom and wife do routinely.... No incestuous thoughts over you absolute freaks", "That\u2019s not the point and you didn\u2019t answer the question lmao", "everyone thinks that until it happens. scent is strongly linked to memory- imagine getting freaky with your partner and you smell your mom \ud83d\ude2c", "Yeah IDC anymore, I'm not standing around letting you assault my nose if I can get away from you I'm doing so. How much attention do these people need."]}
