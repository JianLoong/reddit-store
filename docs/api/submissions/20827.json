Stand firm with your \u201cno\u201d in any case.\n\nWhat will you do if he proposes at your wedding anyway? Could you enlist a relative to control him so you don\u2019t have to deal with it yourself? Prepare now so it will be less of a problem for you on your wedding day.", "NTA. The fact that he cheated and asked you not to tell your mom, and the fact that he\u2019s even asking this of you not once but twice after a no, should pretty much assure you he fully plans on plowing right ahead with this.\n\nI would in the interim tell him over and over how much your mother would absolutely hate him for doing it. Making a spectacle of themselves during your wedding she would hate that, and also see the hypocrisy of the grand gesture in front of the family. Tell him it will just blow up in his face for years to come. \n\nYou\u2019re not going to be able to appeal to his good sense or decorum or caring about you, so just focus on telling him how spectacularly it will fail.", "Nta\n\nIt might be time to uninvite dad entirely. He's trying to get you to plan a massive re-engagement party for him on your dime. \n\nI know personally I wouldn't be able to stop myself from grabbing the mic and telling everyone immediately after that cringey \"proposal\" that he's doing this because he cheated on your mom not once but twice and that you and your now husband did not give him permission to embarrass/guilt your mom into accepting this empty and gross non-apology.\n\nHonestly he sounds like a narcissist. He's only concerned with himself and trying to maintain his comfortable life with your mom despite being the one who sabotaged it. And he's willing to sacrifice you, his child, to do it. Re-proposing isn't really fixing anything about his behavior. It's a grand empty gesture. It's love-bombing your mom to a massive degree.", "NTA - absolutely not.", "NTA - He needs to understand what NO means.

You dont want it, end of discussion, and your dad's attempts to emotionally manipulate you arent a good sign.", "Even before you get to your dad's gross idea that a second proposal will make up in some way for cheating, he would still be the jerk, not you. You don't propose, announce a baby, or do anything else you-centric at someone else's wedding. Otherwise you are not only stealing their limelight, but taking advantage of the setting that they pulled together, usually at great expense. There might be an exception if both of the people getting married explicitly give permission, but even then it feels tacky. You are definitely NTA.", "NTA.

Do not let him have a microphone under any circumstances, tell your vendors.", "NTA.\n\nPeople who try to make someone else's wedding about themselves instead of the couple... are not good people, I'll say, and leave it at that.\n\nAlso, I'd suggest you warn your mom that he's thinking of doing this even though you've repeatedly told him you don't want him to.  Otherwise, he may corner her in front of a crowd and surprise her with it, regardless of what anyone else said.  If she's forewarned, she might have a better chance of heading that off.", "NTA.  What a dick move.  But keep your eye on him, he's going to do it even though you said no.", "NTA. This isn't an appropriate ask.\n\nA better idea would be for him to throw a gargantuan 30th anniversary party for his wife. If he wants to renew their vows, he can re-propose to her on their engagement anniversary and turn their 30th anniversary party into an vow renewal and reception party.  \n\nHe doesn't need to co-opt YOUR WEDDING for his purposes.  That's just selfish and gross. And you can put it to him exactly like that, maybe then he'll understand that what he's asking isn't okay.", "NTA. If they celebrate their 30th, he can re-propose to her then. Your wedding should be celebrating YOUR marriage, and you don\u2019t need your parents\u2019 drama there.", "NTA your father is an AH big time. and he is totally going to do it anyways so I suggest you give your mother a heads up so she is not blindsided in front of the hole family, and, even better, talk with him before he does it  to prevent it.", "Heck no you are HARD NTA! Your mom and dad can work on their relationship on their own time, regardless of your feelings. But you are all grown ups, and your das trying to hijack YOUR and YOUR husbands \ud83d\udc92 is just off off the charts wrong. \n\nStick to your guns.

He doesn't get to make a grand show on your time.", "NTA I\u2019d feel the same way as you.", "You are not the AH, your dad definitely is the AH tho.\nThis whole thing feels very manipulative.\nHe cheated, try to rope you into doing a grand gesture for your mom on your wedding day.. making it seem like you are the key to making his marriage work again\n\nI would tell your mom about your dad's plans to re-pose on your wedding day. Just so it's no longer an option for him.", "HELL no! NTA.\n\nYou will need a large man with a \"Security\" windbreaker and a billy club standing by. Take no chances.", "Wow...definitely NTA. \n\nI agree with others who have posted about him moving forward with the gesture anyway. I agree, try confiding in and appointing one of your friends/family members to keeping tabs on him and diverting the situation. Also, if possible, try explaining to him that this should be his grand gesture and something that is special to him and your mom personally rather than bogarting your special day", "NTA. He is though, in just about every possible way. If he does this on the day, ask in front of everyone if it's because he's trying to make up for cheating on her.", "Holy crap. I can see it now. He is going to do this whether you say yes or no. He thought you wouldn't say no in front of your fiance, but you did. Now he's going to re-propose to your mother and she is going to go \"fuck no.\" Everyone is going to find out he cheated. What a circus it's going to be. \n\nTell your father your mother doesn't need grand gestures. He needs to keep his effing pants on.

More importantly, I want to convince you not to allow him to attend your wedding.\n\nHe asked if he could do something cringey and stupid at your wedding, and you said no. So far, so ehh - he's allowed to ask the first time, and you rightfully denied his request. This is already proof that he doesn't respect your wedding, though.\n\nHe asked again. This is proof positive that he doesn't  respect your word, or your wishes.\n\nYou know he doesn't respect his own marriage, so it's not a stretch to see how he wouldn't respect yours. You said he habitually makes things about himself, and he's told you, to your face, that he plans to make your wedding all about his failings.\n\nIn quite a few cases like this, there are mitigations you can have in place. In this case, having people assigned to drag him out wouldn't be fast enough, and having someone assigned to retorting (\"He's doing this because he got caught cheating\") isn't just airing his filth, but exposes something your mom might be very sensitive about.\n\nSo, he clearly doesn't have any respect for the things that keep most people from pulling stunts like this, he wants to do it, and you can't stop him, or embarrass him once he does. The only winning move is not to play.\n\nDo not allow him at the venue, have burly friends ready to handle it if he does show up, and talk to your mom about how she would like his absence explained.\n\nIf you REALLY want to let him in anyways, talk to your mom about it first, and ask how shutting him down hard if he tries it should be handled.", "NTA. I would also tell your dad that should he do it anyways, because my bet is he is going to whether you like it or not, that you will vocally support her not to accept by publicly announcing his affair partners he has had throughout the years and how he is not worthy to have your mom in his life.

I fear that this is the only way you can stop him.", "No, the solution you need is not to just stop him - it's to *humiliate* him. Elaborate on exactly why he's re-proposing at your wedding, before your mom has a chance to say yes. He wants to ruin things for you? Ruin them right back.", "It will also not be a grand gesture. Everyone should recognize that proposing at someone else\u2019s celebration is cheap and opportunistic, taking basically no effort.", "NTA. \n\nOP, you should tell your mother what dad wants to do and reiterate that you have said NO. Twice. That dad isn\u2019t respecting YOUR WISHES for your wedding day.\n\nSpoil his surprise now bc this is going to blow up if he goes through & that\u2019s what everyone will remember.\n\nCan your fianc\u00e9 have a face to face conversation with him? Make it clear dad is not going to be allowed to propose during the wedding celebration. \n\nOtherwise you need a \u201cdad watch team\u201d to make sure he doesn\u2019t have access to a microphone or any moment to steal the spotlight. \nDJ cuts him off immediately if he tries and dad is swiftly removed from the venue.", "Happy cake \ud83c\udf82 day", "And to unplug the mic.", "I think at least most people in the younger generations have a healthier understanding that it's hard to leave an abusive relationship. And most people would recognize dad as being that type after witnessing that massive love bomb play out in real time. \n\nBeing surrounded by OP's peers like the bridesmaids and not just her own peers (because let's face it not all boomers are caught up on the necessity of mental healthcare) may provide OP's mom with a supportive situation.\n\nAlso tricking a narcissist into publicly outing themselves can be really helpful to dispel the gaslighting.", "Get the DJ to cue up the Hank Williams.\n\nBut in reality, that would simply crush your mother to no end.", "NTA, the serial philanderer isn\u2019t really the guy whose juju I want all over my big day. Keep your fucked up shit outta the nice shit we\u2019re tryna build, serial philanderer.", "NTA\n\nI think this is one time you should tell your mom, OP. Tell her he's asked and you've said no because you don't want your wedding being overshadowed by his infidelity.", "NTA. Get some trusted friends/family to closely watch him the entire time to prevent him from doing this anyway", "NTA. If your mom is a decent person who would find this appalling, just tell her now so she can shut him down and will be able to help keep her husband in line.\n\nIf your mom is a narcissist, disregard.", "There's no way in hell he'll listen to you.  Spoil the surprise and tell your mom what he's going to do and have her forbid it.

Should you go ahead with this proposal be aware that I will make everyone aware of everything you have done wrong in your relationship with mom. I will also be going NC with you afterwards.\u201d\n\nHave this prepared and ready to go, fell free to send him snip it\u2019s as you get closer. Best of luck!", "NtA.

He wants to do this purely for himself so your whole family will see how committed he is to your mother, not realizing it took numerous infidelities for him to try this bullshit. It's almost as if when you told him when your wedding date was his first thought was that this is how he can save the marriage he ruined. He definitely didn't think, \"My daughter is getting married! I am so happy!.\" I mean, he obviously doesn't enjoy or believe in a monogamous relationship.\n\nDo not cave in to his demands.There is no way he doesn't cheat again. He obviously doesn't love your mother and hasn't since the first time he cheated. You need to take the advice others here have given. You need to tell him that if he tries to sneakily grab a microphone or attempt this at the wedding in any way, you will absolutely tell everyone about it then and there. I mean, he will already ruin your wedding by doing it, so you might as well as fuel to the flame.", "Be prepared for him trying, to propose anyway. I\u2019m not sure if there are ways to stop it. Hopefully you can", "This is the way!", "But, but his plan is major spectacle with zero effort!", "Just warn him that, if he does it, you will expose his cheating to everyone there.\n\nThat outta be enough to shut him down.", "I recommend telling him if he re-proposes at your wedding, you will publicly say that you don't think it's a good idea so soon after he repeatedly cheated on her.\n\nIf he defies you, you will out him.

I guarantee he\u2019ll feel slick and jazzed and special about the balloons until he recognizes the tiny phalluses. The decor would be chic and prepared", "What does mom think of this ?", "Absolutely not, you're not the asshole in this situation. Your dad's audacity to even consider re-proposing to your mom on your wedding day is completely out of line. Your wedding is a special occasion that should be focused on you and your fianc\u00e9, not a platform for your dad's grand gestures.\n\nGiven the recent revelation of your dad's infidelity and your mom's decision to work on their marriage, it's understandable that tensions are high. Your priority should be ensuring that your wedding day is a joyous and meaningful event for you and your soon-to-be spouse, not a stage for your dad's attempts at redemption.\n\nBy firmly saying no to his request, you are asserting your boundaries and standing up for what is right. Your concerns about your mom's potential discomfort are valid, and it's important to prioritize her well-being and emotional state during this time.\n\nRemember, it's your day to celebrate your love and commitment, and your dad's desire for a grand gesture should not overshadow that. Stay true to yourself and create a wedding experience that reflects your values and priorities.", "NTA, I would tell your Dad that he either drops this of he will inform the entirety of your wedding guests of his past indiscresions and that you advised your mother to divorce him.", "NTA and maybe consider not having him in the wedding or have some people to keep an eye on him if he tries anything on your wedding day!", "NTA- But have you thought about talking to your mom about this? I highly doubt your mom would be on board with this even if she is willing to try to work things out with you dad. It's your wedding not his get out of jail free card. If he can't respect that then maybe he shouldn't be attending, find a backup to walk you down the aisle.", "NTA. Tell your dad if he does this at your wedding you will put his cheating right then and there. \u201cDads only doing this because he\u2019s been cheating on Mom\u201d", "Dear, of course NTA for not accepting his circus on your wedding day and protecting your mom's feelings at the same time. Let him have a tantrum if he wants to, you are not in the wrong. But be prepared if he wants to go against your wishes and do it yourself anyway. \n\nProtect yourself from his entitled self, and stand your ground. \n\nIt irked me that your dad and mine had a similar reaction to the cheating and the wedding anniversary. Mine was cheating on my mom for sever years with the same lady, everyone knew that (even my younger sisters), and he had the audacity to wanting to celebrate their 25th anniversary of marriage with a \"second wedding\". One day that we were visiting his family for a gathering (my mom was super chill to my aunts), he asked in front of everyone if she would like to marry him again. My mom's reaction was to laugh in his face and to state that she made a mistake once, but she had learned her lesson. My dad was furious that he was rejected in front of his family, he sulked for months. He even complained to me several times, and he didn't like that I said that would be better if they actually celebrated a divorce instead that joke of a marriage.", "NTA that day should be about you and your husband no one else", "Also, OP, I would tell your mom what he's planning. She sounds like she'd put a stop to it.", "Oooh, snap!!!! Do it Do it!!!!\n\nGrab the mic, and put him on blast!!\n\nTho I suspect mother would be upset and go all \"WhY dId YoU hAvE to Put OUr diRtY LaunDRy oUt LiKe DaaaaT?\"", "Thank you I appreciate this", "Do this! Do this! Do this!", "This is really the best solution to prevent him from just doing it anyway.", "She\u2019s repeatedly forgiven a man who has made it clear he neither loves nor respects her, why would we assume the woman is anything but a doormat?", "You\u2019re probably better off talking to your mom BEFORE the wedding about this.", "Totally NTA. But you know that if he likes to make things about himself that he's going to do it anyway, right?", "100% NTA  first he cheats on your mom and now he wants to take your spotlight to atone for his idocy? Nope.", "NTA Why do you even want this cheater on your wedding day ???", "NTA with wedding bells on!\n\nTalk to your mother and preempt this ridiculous self-serving facile performance.", "Goodbye Earl by the Chicks.", "NTA. Your dad sucks", "Tell your mom \n\nYou\u2019re not the AH \n\nMom dad is trying to make my wedding about him by making a grand gesture towards you at my wedding \n\nHe has now asked twice and been told no \n\nPlease tell him that it\u2019s not to happen and he isn\u2019t to ask again or he won\u2019t be coming to my wedding \n\nPlease tell him if he does anything at all about himself on my wedding day I will never ever speak to him again.  We will be totally no contact and that is a promise \n\nBut before I do that I will tell everyone at my wedding what a lying conniving cheat he is \n\nIf mom says what grand gesture ? \n\nTell her to ask him", "NTA. My first thought when I saw the headline was \"I wonder which one cheated\".", "NTA - men who make these public proposals are doing it because they are more likely to get a YES than the NO they would get if it was private.\n\nThe Grand Gesture she requires is fidelity and he is doing this INSTEAD.  He wants everybody to say how lucky she is to have him\n\nPerhaps she should go off and cheat and when she tells him about her extracurricular activities, then his grand gesture would be to say OK.  That's FAIR.", "NTA. Tell your mum his plan and see how she responds.\n\nI like the idea of telling everyone he is recommitting because he's a cheater too haha", "Your Dad needs to stop with the grand gestures and put in the ground work. I\u2019ve never heard anything so self serving! \n\nNTA and have him removed if he pulls this crap", "NTA Your wedding day is about you and it, for sure, is not about a cheater using the day and time set aside to celebrate your special love to ask for a \"do-over\" after he did not cherish his relationship properly! You say your dad thinks your wedding is the perfect opportunity for him to make a grand gestures of some sort - nope, your wedding is the perfect opportunity to celebrate your love and your marriage and that is the only thing it is the perfect opportunity to do. Make this clear to him, then make it clear to anyone with access to or in charge of the microphone (wedding planner, people making toasts, band members, DJ, etc). Is there a friend you could ask to be on 'guard duty' and stay near to your father that day and circumvent his actions if he tries to circumvent your wishes? Better yet, can you have a quiet conversation with your mother and promise your dad that if he does use your wedding to re-propose after messing up his marriage to your mother by cheating, she will say\"NO\" simply because she does not want him to do it at your wedding, either? What selfish person thinks it is a good idea to steal the limelight away from their daughter on her wedding day by asking his daughter's mom for a do-over because he has been unfaithful to her for over a year?! Who brings up cheating on their wife at his daughter's wedding? EWW!", "You don't even like him. Can't you just uninvite him? That way you won't have to deal with his regular bs, or have to look over your shoulder throughout all of the reception to make sure he doesn't pull this stunt.", "Yeah, but that will also humiliate OP's mom, which she doesnt' want to. Mom will be collateral damage.", "The only way to stop him is to say ok, Dad, propose at my wedding, you selfish sob. \nI will do this after your announcement. \n\nFirst excuse your Mom  \n\nThen  tell the guests what a cheating, lying, self-centered dick he is.\nProblem solved!\n Have a beautiful wedding!", "NTA of course\u2026but he\u2019s gonna do it anyway.", "NTA, it's your day and he can sod off with this nonsense, there will be plenty of other opportunities.", "Very definitely NTA. For two reasons.\n\nFirst, your wedding day is YOUR day. Not his.\n\nSecond, he wants this to be as public as possible because your mother is very unlikely to say \"no\" in front of the entire family. He is effectively forcing her to forgive him, in front of the entire family. I absolutely loathe extremely public proposals because it makes it very hard for the person being asked to say anything other than No.\n\nI'm sorry this is happening to you, and Ithink your dad is probably going to wreck your wedding. I would definitely make some trusted friends quietly aware, and have a contingency plan ready to go. Your father sounds like the sort of person who would pull a stunt anyway, because for him, it's the perfect outcome.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA  \n\n\nDad can 'right his wrongs' by, I dunno, NOT CHEATING.", "NTA. Id tell your mom what he is planning because let\u2019s be honest a person like that who has zero morals about cheating on his wife repeatedly probably will still try to do it even without your permission. Your mom needs to be clear that if he does this at your wedding she will refuse him and you will tell everyone why. He needs to know this will be met very harshly", "OP: I don't want him to do that because mum would be embarrassed\n\nREDDIT: OP U SHOULD AIR THE DIRTY LAUNDRY PUBLICLY IN FRONT OF 100 PEOPLE TO ENSURE YOUR MUN IS COMPLETELY MORTIFIED", "Just uninvite him honestly.", "I like you!"]}
