Because I will.\u201d", "NTA. Your dad has a lot of growing up to do. Respecting others seems like his biggest problem - he  cheats on your mom, and he won\u2019t respect your wishes at your wedding.\n\nYou could reiterate everything you wrote here to him, but he sounds so selfish that you\u2019d need to hit him with a truck to make an impression. Stand firm with your \u201cno\u201d in any case.\n\nWhat will you do if he proposes at your wedding anyway? Could you enlist a relative to control him so you don\u2019t have to deal with it yourself? Prepare now so you it will be less of a problem on your wedding day.", "NTA. The fact that he cheated and asked you not to tell your mom, and the fact that he\u2019s even asking this of you not once but twice after a no, should pretty much assure you he fully plans on plowing right ahead with this.\n\nI would in the interim tell him over and over how much your mother would absolutely hate him for doing it. Making a spectacle of themselves during your wedding she would hate that, and also see the hypocrisy of the grand gesture in front of the family. Tell him it will just blow up in his face for years to come. \n\nYou\u2019re not going to be able to appeal to his good sense or decorum or caring about you, so just focus on telling him how spectacularly it will fail.", "Nta\n\nIt might be time to uninvite dad entirely. He's trying to get you to plan a massive re-engagement party for him on your dime. \n\nI know personally I wouldn't be able to stop myself from grabbing the mic and telling everyone immediately after that cringey \"proposal\" that he's doing this because he cheated on your mom not once but twice and that you and your now husband did not give him permission to embarrass/guilt your mom into accepting this empty and gross non-apology.\n\nHonestly he sounds like a narcissist. He's only concerned with himself and trying to maintain his comfortable life with your mom despite being the one who sabotaged it. And he's willing to sacrifice you, his child, to do it. Re-proposing isn't really fixing anything about his behavior. It's a grand empty gesture. It's love-bombing your mom to a massive degree.", "NTA - absolutely not.", "NTA - He needs to understand what NO means.  Even though you've already told him I wouldn't put it past him to do it anyway.  Can you hire security?", "NTA. Have a plan in place because he's going to do it anyway", "NTA, its your wedding day and anything that detracts from that is your call. You dont want it, end of discussion, and your dad's attempts to emotionally manipulate you arent a good sign.", "Even before you get to your dad's gross idea that a second proposal will make up in some way for cheating, he would still be the jerk, not you. You don't propose, announce a baby, or do anything else you-centric at someone else's wedding. Otherwise you are not only stealing their limelight, but taking advantage of the setting that they pulled together, usually at great expense. There might be an exception if both of the people getting married explicitly give permission, but even then it feels tacky. You are definitely NTA.", "NTA. Tell your mom so she can stop him if she sees him start to try at your wedding. Do not let him have a microphone under any circumstances, tell your vendors.", "NTA.\n\nPeople who try to make someone else's wedding about themselves instead of the couple... are not good people, I'll say, and leave it at that.\n\nAlso, I'd suggest you warn your mom that he's thinking of doing this even though you've repeatedly told him you don't want him to.  Otherwise, he may corner her in front of a crowd and surprise her with it, regardless of what anyone else said.  If she's forewarned, she might have a better chance of heading that off.", "NTA.  What a dick move.  But keep your eye on him, he's going to do it even though you said no.", "NTA. This isn't an appropriate ask.\n\nA better idea would be for him to throw a gargantuan 30th anniversary party for his wife. If he wants to renew their vows, he can re-propose to her on their engagement anniversary and turn their 30th anniversary party into an vow renewal and reception party.  \n\nHe doesn't need to co-opt YOUR WEDDING for his purposes.  That's just selfish and gross. And you can put it to him exactly like that, maybe then he'll understand that what he's asking isn't okay.", "NTA. If they celebrate their 30th, he can re-propose to her then. Your wedding should be celebrating YOUR marriage, and you don\u2019t need your parents\u2019 drama there.", "NTA your father is an AH big time. and he is totally going to do it anyways so I suggest you give your mother a heads up so she is not blindsided in front of the hole family, and, even better, talk with him before he does it  to prevent it.", "Heck no you are HARD NTA! Your mom and dad can work on their relationship on their own time, regardless of your feelings. But you are all grown ups, and your das trying to hijack YOUR and YOUR husbands \ud83d\udc92 is just off off the charts wrong. \n\nStick to your guns. Make it clear there will consequences if he even thinks about stepping out of line.\n\nCongratulations, and hope have a wonderful wedding!", "I would ask your mom not to let him re-propose to her at your wedding. Maybe it's the petty side of me, but I would want to ruin any chance at a surprise so he wouldn't do it.", "NTA Your Dads clearly TA not you. His fuck ups shouldn\u2019t be solved at your wedding.", "NTA.  This is you and your partner's day, not his.  He doesn't get to make a grand show on your time.", "NTA I\u2019d feel the same way as you.", "You are not the AH, your dad definitely is the AH tho.\nThis whole thing feels very manipulative.\nHe cheated, try to rope you into doing a grand gesture for your mom on your wedding day.. making it seem like you are the key to making his marriage work again\n\nI would tell your mom about your dad's plans to re-pose on your wedding day. Just so it's no longer an option for him.", "HELL no! NTA.\n\nYou will need a large man with a \"Security\" windbreaker and a billy club standing by. Take no chances.", "Wow...definitely NTA. \n\nI agree with others who have posted about him moving forward with the gesture anyway. I agree, try confiding in and appointing one of your friends/family members to keeping tabs on him and diverting the situation. Also, if possible, try explaining to him that this should be his grand gesture and something that is special to him and your mom personally rather than bogarting your special day", "NTA. He is though, in just about every possible way. If he does this on the day, ask in front of everyone if it's because he's trying to make up for cheating on her.", "Holy crap. I can see it now. He is going to do this whether you say yes or no. He thought you wouldn't say no in front of your fiance, but you did. Now he's going to re-propose to your mother and she is going to go \"fuck no.\" Everyone is going to find out he cheated. What a circus it's going to be. \n\nTell your father your mother doesn't need grand gestures. He needs to keep his effing pants on. Tell him to stop trying to take the easy way and actually do the hard work. NTA", "NTA\n\n'Dad, if you ask me to re-pose one more time, I will uninvite you to my wedding. If you re-pose at my wedding, I will have you removed by security and cut all contact with you indefinitely. I am horrified by how selfish you are being. Stop trying to ruin my wedding.

Tell Dad you're going to tell Mom in advance what he's up to so she can put a stop to it. Your wedding, your rules.", "Ok, right off the bat, this is easy, you're NTA. More importantly, I want to convince you not to allow him to attend your wedding.\n\nHe asked if he could do something cringey and stupid at your wedding, and you said no. So far, so ehh - he's allowed to ask the first time, and you rightfully denied his request. This is already proof that he doesn't respect your wedding, though.\n\nHe asked again. This is proof positive that he doesn't  respect your word, or your wishes.\n\nYou know he doesn't respect his own marriage, so it's not a stretch to see how he wouldn't respect yours. You said he habitually makes things about himself, and he's told you, to your face, that he plans to make your wedding all about his failings.\n\nIn quite a few cases like this, there are mitigations you can have in place. In this case, having people assigned to drag him out wouldn't be fast enough, and having someone assigned to retorting (\"He's doing this because he got caught cheating\") isn't just airing his filth, but exposes something your mom might be very sensitive about.\n\nSo, he clearly doesn't have any respect for the things that keep most people from pulling stunts like this, he wants to do it, and you can't stop him, or embarrass him once he does. The only winning move is not to play.\n\nDo not allow him at the venue, have burly friends ready to handle it if he does show up, and talk to your mom about how she would like his absence explained.\n\nIf you REALLY want to let him in anyways, talk to your mom about it first, and ask how shutting him down hard if he tries it should be handled.", "NTA. I would also tell your dad that should he do it anyways, because my bet is he is going to whether you like it or not, that you will vocally support her not to accept by publicly announcing his affair partners he has had throughout the years and how he is not worthy to have your mom in his life. And stare him down to let him know that you will do that. Your wedding is not the place to fix his problems.", "Tell daddy to figure out some other way to solve his problems. Not your special day. NTA.", "You should promise story time for all your wedding guests if he tries to pull that shit.", "NTA! I would also see about talking to the wedding planner (if applicable) so they can be aware of what he might pull on your day to nip it in the bud. maybe even a friend to sit at their table to keep an eye on him.", "Have you considered warning your mother about his proposed proposal? I'd have to believe that would put a hard stop on it. (If not, you also have mom problems, and im sorry about that too.)\n\nObviously NTA", "NTA. Tell your mom what he\u2019s planning to do. Like, now.", "I would make a comments in front of your mom: 'this man proposed on someone else's wedding, can you believe that he stole someone else's spotlight'. Don't know your mom but if she agrees than it might derail him. \n\nI'm afraid your dad is gonna propose with or without your blessing so definitly take precautions. NTA.", "NO!!! He can propose somewhere else\u2026 however, I have a feeling it doesn\u2019t matter what you think\u2026 because he\u2019s going to do it anyway and then he\u2019s going to get pissed at you because it pissed you off. He probably doesn\u2019t care about what it will do to your wedding. You might want to have some people stand guard so that he doesn\u2019t hijack your wedding. Plus- he\u2019s a cheap skate trying to tag it onto your wedding. Your Not The Ass", "NTA.  But he's going to do it anyway so be prepared.", "NTA. Tell your mother what he's planning and enlist her help in shutting it down.", "NTA... Tell him that it is his egocentric ways that have allowed him to think cheating wasn't wrong. Using someone elses wedding to patch his own marriage is just another symptom of his ingrained selfishness.\n\nEDIT\n\nI second the brilliant idea below. Let him know if he does this, you will announce why he is making grandiose gestures to make up for his habitual infidelity", "NTA. He\u2019s gonna do it. If I were you I\u2019d tell him that if he ruins your wedding you will tell the DJ to I form the audience your dad is twice a cheat.", "NTA. Honestly if the relationship with your dad is tumultuous just uninvite him because I promise he will DEFINITELY STILL DO IT at your wedding. Also repropose because it\u2019s a 30 year anniversary to a marriage he stepped out on is tacky and such a slap in the face to your mom", "NTA it's ur wedding", "NTA.\nSounds like Dad needs to be told his 'grand gesture' is actually just tacky.\nIf he wants to make a big deal of your mother (which he should, given that he's failed as a husband so far), he should have the grace to make that big deal on a day that's actually about her. Usurping your wedding day is not romantic, not appropriate and NOT the way to show your mother that he loves her.", "NTA.  Why do people think someone else's wedding is the appropriate place for wedding proposals and pregnancy?
