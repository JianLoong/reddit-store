He left at 7pm and told me he would be back around 2/3 when the pubs had shut etc. my partner barely goes out and I have major anxiety with drunk people as my had was an alcoholic and used to beat me and my sister, which he knows. \n\nI did my own thing and had a good evening. He didn\u2019t contact me all night which left me a bit worried but I woke up around 4 and he wasn\u2019t home, so I tried to call him multiple times but no answer. I left it until 4:30 and I called the police. I said I was concerned that something may have happened as this was unusual behaviour for him. They advised that I should go and look for him and that they would keep an eye out if they saw him. I did a few checks of our town but couldn\u2019t find him. I went home and called the police to inform them that I hadn\u2019t found him, they said they contacted the hospital and that he wasn\u2019t there. I asked them if I was overreacting and they said if the behaviour was unusual then it\u2019s best to make enquires just incase something did happen and you\u2019re just looking out for his welfare. I messaged a few on his colleagues incase he had passed out on a sofa etc but ofc no answer. \n\nThe police advised that if I hadn\u2019t heard anything by 12pm to ring them again. \n\nMy partner came home at 7am pissed and heavily drunk. He went to bed and I informed the police he had made it home and that I was thankful for help. \n\nWhen my partner woke up, he blew up at me calling me an embarrassment because the police had contacted some people he knew to see where he was and that I was an insecure stupid girl and that he can\u2019t go out for a night out without the police involved. I was really hurt by this and maybe I was an asshole but these situations make me uncomfortable and I was worried something happened to him. He said he didn\u2019t care and that he\u2019s fed up of my shit. \n\nNow fast forward to today, he said his mates and colleagues make him a laughing stock because of my reaction\u2026 \n\nReddit, am I an embarrassment??", "created_utc": 1672577725, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100j3av/aita_for_calling_the_police/", "score": 283, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s totally reasonable to get police involved when someone is uncharacteristically late and unreachable. It is not reasonable to come home 5 hours after he said he would and then to be mad at you for being concerned.", "NTA for calling the police but you'd be the asshole to yourself if you stay with someone who is this mean to you", "NTA\n\n- He knew you would be worried\n- He did not come home when he said he would\n- He did not respond to messages or attempt to communicate his whereabouts\n\nWhat did he think would happen? Brought it on himself.", "NTA. You had a valid reason to be concerned; pub closes around 2-3 and he's still not home by 4:30? What was he even doing until 7???? I would think that's scary too if I were in that situation, regardless of your past history with alcoholism. If you can't talk about this with him when he's sober, you might want to consider leaving him.", "nta\n\nno import needed\n\nanyone would act the same way you waited till the next morning\n\nhe seems like a tool", "NTA. He embarrassed himself.", "NTA, your partner is TA. He should be happy, you are concerned and care about him. Your partner is the embarrassment in this story.\n\nI would reconsider this relationship after what he said to you.", "You\u2019re NTA but he kinda is, he made himself completely unreachable and could\u2019ve been lying dead in a gutter for all you knew and he\u2019s going off at your for caring about him which is a red flag, if his phone went flat and he didn\u2019t have a charger would\u2019ve made sense but he told you he\u2019d be back around 2/3 and shows up 4 hours late without telling you beforehand, I guess you\u2019re learning now that he isn\u2019t a very responsible drunk", "NTA. You were just worried. He doesn't sound as if he is worth it, though.", "You are an embarrassment only to yourself for being with this asshole. \n\nIn the real world, you are NTA and need to move on from this inconsiderate self centered asshole.", "NTA\n\nHis actions, his consequences. He chose to act the fool so you reacted. If he won\u2019t call or text his whereabouts then he\u2019s clearly not concerned about your feelings. Why then would you be concerned about his feelings?", "NTA. He should have contacted you and told you it's going to take longer. Not answering the phone was a shitty move. If he is always like this, you should reconsider your relationship.", "NTA\n\n4.30am might have been a little early to call the police given he had said home 2/3am but I can see it was done out of concern. He equally should have been more considerate in coming home when he said he would or letting you know that he would be later.\n\nMy biggest worry for you is his reaction seems very over the top and comments such as \"he's fed up of my shit\" feel to me like there are bigger issues between you. If he barely goes out then it wasn't unreasonable for him to expect that he could have a night out to enjoy himself at Christmas. I understand that you have issues from past trauma but you can't project those onto him or control him to ease those fears. I would encourage you to try to have an honest conversation once things calm down and to consider whether perhaps you need to speak to somebody about your anxiety?", "NTA \n\nYour partner was irresponsible for not caring about your anxiety issues and not responding to your calls.

Yes, but due to past trauma I think you've got a decent reason as to why you did.\n\nHowever, your husband calling you \"an insecure stupid girl\" and saying \"he's fed up of your shit\", especially if he knows about your father, is disgusting behaviour from a partner.  \n\nIs this kind of thing normal?

A \"night out\" is one thing, not disappearing and being unresponsive.\n\nMy guess is he was cheating on you and spent the night at another person's home", "NTA, and please leave him. You do not deserve to be treated this way, your partner is a huge AH.", "NTA. Your partner is, he knew you were anxious and had issues with drunk people, he failed to respond to your messages, and he failed to apologise for making you worry, rather he insulted you for caring.  It would have not taken much effort to sent a reply of still having fun, back later.", "Omg hun, leave him. I'm genuinely worried for you. If he starts in with the emotional abuse all because you were worried about him; then you need to leave. It's not hard to text back or answer a call.

All he has to do was contact you and let you know plans had changed, and I understand that he was drunk and not think right but that's sorta his own fault. That's what happens when you drink. If you can't drink responsibly, don't get pissed when your irresponsibility has consequence.", "YTA for immediately going to the police and then continuing to call them. I'd personally be embarrassed too if cops were calling my people especially if it wasn't even 12 hours. Yes he should have kept you updated but you said he was still drunk so obviously he partied hard. I just don't think cops should have been the immediate answer just because he didn't answer and wasn't home by the time you thought appropriate.", "NTA.

He's made this all about his reputation when you were worried about his well-being. And he isn't reciprocating as he hasn't spared a thought for your well-being but has made sure to double down on how his reputation has been destroyed somehow by... you making sure he was alive and safe. \n\nHe is acting like a bratty teenager whose mum called to find out where he was and his friends being similarly childish laughed at him for it and he threw a fit at you.
