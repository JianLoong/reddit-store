Today my son (8) asked to go to Waffle House for lunch to celebrate an achievement.  We (my husband, son, and I) sat in a booth adjacent to three late 20s/ early 30s women who had just sat down before us, with my back to their booth and my son and husband across from me. \n\nWe ordered and are enjoying our food, and they are having an energetic conversation behind us. Not crazy loud, but loud enough for the three of us to hear them, and for me to cringe every time the woman facing our table dropped the F bomb. After a while, I became uncomfortable with my kiddo hearing this conversation. I turned around in my seat and quietly asked them to please stop saying F*** in front of my son. The woman facing our table leaned forward and asked me to repeat myself. I did. She then responds that we are in a public place and that she has kids, too. Then as this was happening, the waitress serving both our tables came by to check on them, and she complained to the waitress that I was being rude. I turned back to my table, requested to go boxes from the waitress, and didn't say anything further to the party behind me. I could certainly hear them talking about how offended they were, and commenting that next time we should go to IHOP. (I guess because it's more family friendly?)\n\nI was flabbergasted. I was expecting them to laugh it off, not get prickly that I had the audacity to make such a request.

It is absolutely ridiculous of you to go around playing language police in a public place, and to other adults. Who do you think you are?

I don\u2019t consider myself old-fashioned, in fact I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with cursing. Words are just words, for the most part they only have as much power as you give them, but I don\u2019t curse in public around kids and old people. The fact is people will be rude in public forever from now on. Whether it\u2019s the language, the volume they are speaking at, the volume of the videos they are watching on their phones, taking more seats than they need, whatever, civility and basic manners can no longer be expected anywhere or at any time.  It sucks but if anything along with teaching your kid manners (as there are some civilized people who will still do this) you have to teach them what battles to choose and more importantly which ones to walk away from to avoid being shot. Tragic? Yes. Exaggerated? Nope.", "Nta. It is public. While I completely understand your side I also see their side as well. Although there is nothing wrong at all with asking for her to stop cursing ,We can\u2019t police people in public. I commend you for just leaving instead of letting it escalate. You did what someone should do. You asked, they said no so you removed your self, instead of staying and demanding those around you cater to your family. You didn\u2019t act entitled. You shouldn\u2019t feel bad when you handled this gracefully. Kudos for being a positive influence on your little boy, he\u2019ll grow up with great conflict resolution skills watching you. we can\u2019t control how other people act towards us but we can control how we react.", "NTA\u2026you asked politely and removed yourself rather than let it escalate.

You can't police people's language in public. If you don't want your child picking up that language, you explain it's not nice but you can't shield him from it.

That would be very wild.  \n\n\nHowever in a restaurant where you and other patrons are seated and stationary and nobody is moving anywhere then I don't think it's entirely out of pocket to politely ask an adjacent table if they would mind keeping it PG if there is a kid at your table.  \n\n\nI also agree with other folks that it is probably easier to just ask your server to move you to a new table away from the conversation.", "I think it's wild to need to ask someone to tone down their languagein a public space containing children.  Seriously, if the word appears that often in one's conversation, what does one say for emphasis?", "So you would rather police others language in a public setting than just parent your child on their own use of age appropriate language?", "Who cares what words they\u2019re using when they aren\u2019t speaking to you?", "I also feel like this is super situational.  \n\n\nLike, walking up to some people talking at a park or just generally minding their own business out in public and asking them to watch their language would be very problematic.  \n\n\nRestaurants are kind of the exception to the rule here and even then a lot of it depends on how loud the table is. OP said they weren't being crazy loud so it's really open to interpretation.", "You're making a bunch of assumptions.  \n\n\nI never said I would \"rather\" do one or the other. You asked me a direct question and I answered it.  \n\n\nYou're also making it seem like doing one precludes the other.  \n\n\nIn this case I just answered the direct question you asked me.", "Why would you need to request they change their language if you weren\u2019t trying to avoid your child using the language? \n\nLike why does the world have to change simply because you have a child with you?", "The short answer is that we live in a society and as a result of that we have a social contract. Which means you don't just get to do or say absolutely whatever you want whenever you want and where ever you want.  \n\n\nYou seem like a the kind of person that likes to pick at statements and make assumptions about what someone means so I'm going to try and explain more fully in the hopes that it will avoid any more misunderstanding  \n\n\nA parent should absolutely ensure their child understands age appropriate language because not everything can be controlled and it is almost impossible to prevent them from being exposed to it.  \n\n\nHowever that doesn't mean that a polite request in a restaurant setting from one party to another to dial back language or behavior is rude or unacceptable. Just like that party can choose to politely agree or decline that request.  \n\n\nIf the request is declined then the first party can either choose to complain, move tables, leave the restaurant or any other course of action that is legally available to them.  \n\n\nNow I don't have kids so I don't personally care and if I did then I think I would probably just choose to move tables before escalating a situation with a confrontation, no matter how polite.  \n\n\nBut I also don't think the request is as wild as some people are making it out to be."]}
