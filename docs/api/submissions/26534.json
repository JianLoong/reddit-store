Today my son (8) asked to go to Waffle House for lunch to celebrate an achievement.  We (my husband, son, and I) sat in a booth adjacent to three late 20s/ early 30s women who had just sat down before us, with my back to their booth and my son and husband across from me. \n\nWe ordered and are enjoying our food, and they are having an energetic conversation behind us. Not crazy loud, but loud enough for the three of us to hear them, and for me to cringe every time the woman facing our table dropped the F bomb. After a while, I became uncomfortable with my kiddo hearing this conversation. I turned around in my seat and quietly asked them to please stop saying F*** in front of my son. The woman facing our table leaned forward and asked me to repeat myself. I did. She then responds that we are in a public place and that she has kids, too. Then as this was happening, the waitress serving both our tables came by to check on them, and she complained to the waitress that I was being rude. I turned back to my table, requested to go boxes from the waitress, and didn't say anything further to the party behind me. I could certainly hear them talking about how offended they were, and commenting that next time we should go to IHOP. (I guess because it's more family friendly?)\n\nI was flabbergasted. I was expecting them to laugh it off, not get prickly that I had the audacity to make such a request.

It's a public restaurant, you're going to have to deal with the public. As long as no one is swearing AT your kid, you can't reasonably expect to control someone else's language, especially a stranger in a public setting. Your son is 8. I can almost guarantee he's heard the F bomb before, and an 8 year old should be  enough to know not to repeat words they don't know (unless they are asking what the word means, which is an innocent question). Even if he does repeat, a simple \"hey I don't want you using that word because it's rude\" should be enough to correct the issue. Different parents have different rules and different things they are comfortable with, and not everyone has a problem with swearing in front of children. The other mom wasn't an AH for swearing in a public space (especially since this isn't a place specifically catered towards kids) and you aren't an AH for not wanting people to swear in front of your son, but trying to police a strangers behavior in public when their behavior wasn't hurting anyone (your son hearing the F word will not hurt him or you even though you don't like it) is going a bit too far and is unrealistic. You can't shelter your son forever, especially from things that are harmless in the long run. A better approach than trying to control the language of random strangers out in public is to have a conversation with your son about why you don't like that word and why you don't want him to use it. Also make sure to mention that you can't control other people's language. You as his mother can make rules to teach him to be polite and safe and make good decisions and that's why you can expect him not to use that word. Neither you nor him can expect strangers to follow your rules regarding appropriate language. What you CAN do if someone is using inappropriate language around you is leave. Or if the language is HURTFUL and actually hurtful, not just language you don't like, you can tell the proper people (staff at a business, a teacher, a parent or caregiver, etc).", "YTA, OP.

That\u2019s when you just start talking louder to whoever your with, and hopefully it\u2019s easier to tune the others out.", "The point of the sub is TO ACCEPT JUDGEMENT.", "It's not a waffle house. It's a waffle home", "HA! This just brought back so many memories of being absolutely trashed at Denny's in my late teen years. This is accurate lol", "I went to a Denny\u2019s at midday and my waiter was a short gawky white guy who spoke with *heavy* AAVE. My friend ordered an Oreo milkshake, the waiter said they were out, but that he could \u201cmake it anyways\u201d whatever that meant. When he dropped off the bill he had written his SoundCloud on it lol. He was very nice though.", "Last night I was reading a book with my almost-four-year-old and it talked about a kid saying bad words. I asked him which words he thought the kid was saying and he said \u201cumm\u2026..poo, pee, crash, bam, coconut?\u201d", "But adults should know not to say a bunch of foul shit around someone else's kids. But alot of young people now would just tell you to go piss up a rope. If they're over 18 and don't know how to act, I'll sendmy kids home and handle it. Everybody wants to talk about respect and then be disrespectful to my kids who will be gone in 15 minutes or less. I would politely ask them to keep the foul language to a minimum before deciding how to proceed. It's a public place. Any moron can not cuss or keep it down for a minute if they see young children. Noone should be saying that's just how it is nowadays. If that's the case, some folks need to grow up or learn. I'm big on manners though. Some folks are never taught any.", "Eeeeeeew to infinity \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e", "I would have asked her why the heck her kid was up this late? Like what small child is up and out at a BAR at midnight? There's definitely a bigger issue and that's woth her parenting.", "I think it\u2019s really dependent on class and culture. Most of my classmates and I didn\u2019t start swearing until around middle school but I have some friends who came out of the room cussing", "Also, this \"Anglo-sphere\" that you're talking about...what exactly is that? Does it contain Scotland, England or Ireland by any chance?", "Cultural standards also include, quite importantly, the immediate niche, which is a fucking Waffle House. If they were at Disneyland, sure.\n\nAnd I don't know, in my book, interrupting stranger's conversation is bigger asshole move than dropping fbombs within the earshot of young kids (who are probably a couple of years ago from using it anyway, because, you know, internet).\n\nClassey people, if it were REALLY that important for them the vocabulary of strangers, would have taken a much MUCH humbler approach, starting with a gently placed explanation of what they are about to request and it's is obviously not within their right to ask them to do this particular thing but they would be really grateful if they could do this particular thing for their family and they would understand if it's not something that they agree to. \n\nI think you confuse entitlement with being rudeness (I am rude). Entitlement is telling someone what to do while expecting it so much that you are literally shocked about the refusal and write about it on reddit hoping at least someone would agree with their bullshit behaviour.\n\nYou can go fuck off yourself.\n\n\u270c\ufe0f", "I laughed so fucking hard at that", "This is getting stitched and hung on the wall :-D", "When I worked nights at a gas station, my dad came to pick me up on my birthday. The only place open was Denny's lol.", "That\u2019s too bad! I\u2019ve noticed with waffle house it\u2019s very location specific as to the quality and clientele. \nThe one I go to in Mckinney Texas is fantastic.  The one I used to go to in Arlington..not so much \ud83e\udd22", "in today's world.... that kid probably knows more cuss words then us adults...", "We had the conversation that they are adult words and not necessarily bad words. I also don't want them to use towards people. If they stub their toe and yell shit, it is very different then calling someone a asshole. Also never at school lol. They are also only 8&10 so it will change dynamics as they get older", "UK, US, and all former colonies of those glorious empires. But I suppose you\u2019re an urbanite, where rudeness is probably more useful than in my idyllic life.", "Imagine thinking rudeness was a virtue, lol; your last paragraph is nonsensical, enjoy your feeling of righteousness, I guess.", "If it was the one on North Collins I'm with you. That one is a zoo. Just before I left Lewisville they opened a brand new one. I still miss it.", "There is actually a Waffle House scale in times of national emergency. If Waffle House can't stay open, it's basically a death sentence. I can not imagine taking a child to Waffle House and expecting a family-friendly environment. It's the Hunger Games of the restaurant industry.", "I believe Australia is also in that circle of glory. Do you have any idea how adorably they use the fboms and cbombs? (Also seriously, Scotland and Ireland, they basically speak in profanity)", "Again, isn't righteousness thinking your way is the right way? My way is you do your way and I do my way.", "Excellent point. 97 flavors of cheesecake and yes they will bring you wine. Also they make every dinner dish known to mankind.", "Wow, are you some Richie Richguy? Pancake Parlour is so overpriced!", "I grew up in a smallish town near Atlanta. There wasn\u2019t much to do so we hung out at the Waffle House a good bit between getting drivers licenses and going off to college. I wouldn\u2019t take kids there late at night but breakfast/lunch time is usually fine. That said, if there is some weird stuff going on you just have to chalk it up to being part of the experience. I consider it educational lol.\n\nESH your kid is 8. He\u2019s heard the F word by now. Unless they were describing lewd sex acts or something, it\u2019s probably not going to make that much of an impression. They could have let it go and toned it down a little. Why can\u2019t everyone just chill and eat their hash browns?", "The reputation has gotten out of hand. It mostly comes from people in places without them who've only seen videos.", "OoooooWeeee I cannot IMAGINE. I am the one in my family who is carrying the No Sense Torch now so I would have been eating baloney sandwiches and drinking off-brand soda in the jail."]}
