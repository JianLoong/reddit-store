{"id": 14245, "submission_id": "12ez38b", "title": "AITA for giving my husband an ultimatum about building a pool?", "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nLong story short, my husband wants to build a pool. Not have a company build it, but build it himself. He wants to buy a kit online and do all the work himself.\n\nI think this is a terrible idea for so many reasons. He knows nothing about building a pool, for one. There's the cost of renting the digging equipment and whatever other tools and equipment we would need, how it all needs to be done, permits and regulations, wtf are we going to uncover when we start to dig and how to deal with that, etc. He wants to do it for 2 reasons: \"to save money\" and \"because he can.\"\n\nWe've talked so many times about this. He knows I don't think it's a good idea. His mom agrees with me and even said she'd give us money to have a pool built, but not if he did it himself. Finally, I told him this was OUR money, OUR house, and OUR yard, not his, and it's OUR decision, not his, so it's either build the pool himself at the expense of his family, or have one built and keep his family. He chose to keep his family. \n\nFast forward a couple of weeks and he says I'm being controlling by not letting him do this. I really don't think so. Marriage is a partnership and big financial decisions should be a 2 yes and 1 no type situation. He doesn't see it that way.\n\nSo, AITA here? Am I being a controlling bitch?\n\nETA this is an in-ground pool. HOA rules no above ground. I hate it too, but that's the way it is.\n\nETA again to clarify a few things: my husband has a very demanding job that takes him out of town 1 week each month, at least. Even when he takes a day off, they call him and he has to do something from home. Devoting a large amount of time to this is doomed from the beginning. \n\nHe has a LONG history of starting projects and not finishing them. I've lost count of the projects at this point. He has a list of things that NEED to be done and neglects them due to work/travel or it's too complicated. Plus when he does get started on something, it's always more complicated than he expected, he has to change his plans, buy new tools, and spend more time than he anticipated. Every single time. It's so much easier just to hire people to do even simple things. \n\nI agree our communication sucks. We've been talking about this exact thing for 3 years and he wouldn't budge. The ultimatum was a last, desperate attempt to get him to see reason.", "created_utc": 1680901030, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ez38b/aita_for_giving_my_husband_an_ultimatum_about/", "score": 142, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is a big financial and housing decision that should be made as a team.", "nta\n\nI\u2019ve built pools for years, and there\u2019s a lot more to it than people think. From the initial permits to the necessary electrical wiring, it\u2019s a complex process.

Hell, one stray rock underneath and now you gotta deal with liner issues.\n\nOh, and the super obvious bit about pool building requiring more than one person, anyway.", "NTA. I am a pool contractor and my uncle built his pool himself to save money. He ended up spending almost 50,000 dollars more than the bid I had given him originally.", "He won't be able to do this.

He seems to be prioritizing his own want to build a pool over the logical and financially feasible option.", "NTA.  \n\n\nThere are so many things that could go wrong building your own in-ground pool. You are right to want to have a professional do it.

You have an absolute right to have a say in something as big as your husband installing a pool in your backyard. It sounds like he is being petulant just to be petulant at this point, particularly since his family will help out financially to get one installed. \n\nYou were right to put your foot down, even if it's harsh. You can't have your husband just digging up your yard to prov his manhood or whatever he's trying to do.", "NTA- not at all. He's just putting that label on you because you didn't let him do what he wanted to do. It's absurd and ridiculous, but so is trying to build your own pool when you have no clue wtf you are doing.", "NTA. Want and need are two different things. The \u201cneed\u201d to do it himself would prevail if financial reasons prohibited it being done any other way, but that\u2019s not the case. So it\u2019s his \u201cwant\u201d against your \u201cwant\u201d. The deciding factor comes down to liability \u2014 the possibility of him getting hurt, not doing it correctly, hitting buried lines or pipes, etc. is too great to tip the scales his way. If he\u2019s the primary breadwinner and is injured, how would lost wages affect you? And your homeowner\u2019s insurance may not even cover damage done from DIY projects. Bottom line, him doing the job himself is putting your family\u2019s financial future at risk.", "NTA Your ultimatum was extreme, but this project is just too big to be a diy, unless he has some special experience and expertise. \n\nAfter 20+ years of marriage and tons of household projects we barely do anything ourselves anymore. Even simple projects can go horribly wrong and leave you without some basic necessities for an extended time. If we can afford to pay someone to do it, we pay.", "NTA.\n\nIf he knew what he was doing it'd be different, but clearly he doesn't. If he wants to build something himself, tell him to start with a pool shed. Even if he screws it up it's cheap.", "NTA - There is a reason professional pool installers  exist. Just an above ground pool is way more work than the average person can imagine (worked installing above ground pools one summer). There is no way your husband should be taking on installing an inground pool by himself.", "NTA - he needs to accept he\u2019s no fucking pool construction dude. Watching some YouTube videos on it won\u2019t cut it. It\u2019d be a complete  disaster starting with digging up pipes and electrical wires and ending with a pool that probably leaks and is illegal and has to be removed before you can sell the place. Your negotiation tactics suck BTW, but you are right in that he absolutely should not do this.", "Definitely NTA. It seems like he has to prove that he can do it, for whatever reason that may be. People just have to accept that some things they know how to do, and some things they don\u2019t. \nAs you say, it\u2019s both of yours house and yard, and if 50% says no, it\u2019s a no. Hire people who knows how to do this, if he does it himself it will end up costing a lot more. Good luck!", "Build a pool from scratch , no experience. Hmmmm, ask him how he would feel if you decided to add another story to your house, no experience. \n\nNTA !!!\n\nget him the biggest king size Lego set you can find, see how he does. Maybe that will get what ever is itching him out of his system.", "ESH \n\nThe ultimatum was a bit assholish, but he\u2019s being the bigger asshole for sure.", "ESH it\u2019s your home too and you both need to agree in major decisions like a DIY pool. It may be that your husband coukd do a great job. My husband is extremely handy and has bulit an outdoor shower, fences and even boats. If he said he could build a pool, I\u2019d believe him due to his long track record of building things that turn out great and add value to our property. \n\nConversely, your husband might do a terrible job and fail to build to code and either damage your property or create problems down the road if you want to sell your home. He might not get the right permits or make other mistakes that you\u2019d be living with for a long time.\n\nFor example, a friend\u2019s husband started a number of projects around their home that involved digging holes. Eventually their property has at least six areas with partly finished projects that were downright hazardous to their kids. When they eventually decided to sell their home, they had to spend thousands of dollars to have all the holes filled in and the property regraded. \n\nIt\u2019s even possible that your neighbors might file a complaint about something that was neglected and you\u2019d have to remove the pool. Someone we know spent quite a bit of money building a shed and playhouse for their kids that was too close to the property line and emded up having to remove it. \n\nIt\u2019s impossible for us to know if he\u2019s up to this challenge or not. I think the best idea is to consult with a pool company, find out what they recommend and the cost, and talk to your husband in depth about the pros and cons of doing it himself. There\u2019s a lot to know about pools so unless your husband has experience doing construction and a solid track record of success with similar projects, he should probably leave it to a professional.\n\nETA: I changed my verdict because I feel you are both AHs for not communicating like adults and agreeing in a plan that is comfortable for both of you, instead of taking \u201cit\u2019s my way or the highway\u201d as your position and he\u2019s one for not being willing to at least consider working with pool professionals.", "ESH - he's not thinking about the bigger picture and the things that could go wrong considering he has no experience, and now he appears to be sulking. you're not being controlling, however pool or family is a bit of a horrible ultimatum to give", "This is really a question about practicalities. \n\nSo, I'm pretty sympethetic to his reasons here. Saving money, and being able to build a pool sounds like pretty great things. Driving heavy equipment is also freaking fun.\n\nYou've not outlines really any of the most important considerations for deciding something like this.\n\n1. Has your husband done any other projects like this around the house? Any other renovations even approaching \n2. Does he have a plan? Like, it's not rocket science. With the power of the internet, most people can figure out how to do most things, but it does require thinking it through and developing a build-plan.\n3. Is this a significant portion of your family budget?\n4. Does your husband actually have the time to build it? This is likely an entire summer's worth of nights and weekends.\n\nAlso keep in mind, that with some prep-work, you can get a pretty good idea of what sort of things might be running through your yard, and paying someone else to dig the hole doesn't mean you won't have to pay for anything they find.\n\nI'm going with NAH, leaning towards YTA.", "YTA-giving him an ultimatum over this goes into AH territory. Although, I agree it sounds like a really bad idea.

Your husband is not thinking through things.", "YTA so this seems to be the unpopular opinion here, but you never said how hands on your husband is with other things. If he is capable, then let him do it! Do you realize how much pride he'll feel every single time your enjoying the pool. He will know that his blood sweat and tears made you happy!  And all the things that you worry may happen. Most are highly unlikely,  and the rest the pool company would end up charging more for anyways.  \nI say let the man use his hands and he'll make you proud!", "ESH. Ok he wants to do it himself so meet him part way. Why not have him dig, then have a contractor coming and finish the installation.\n\nHe'd get the nasty part out of his system and save a few bucks. Make sure you line up a contractor first who is on board with it and knows what to expect regarding the hole etc.", "ESH.\n\nYour relationship is over, you just haven't realized it yet. It ended the moment he realized you're willing to threaten his access to his family to get what you want.\n\nThere were dozens of better ways you could have approached this. You could have spent half an hour on Google and showed him it's more expensive to rent a backhoe than to hire a contractor. You could have gotten quotes. You could have showed him horror stories on YouTube of people who got in over their heads doing this. You could have given him a different, safer project to devote his fragile masculinity to finishing.\n\nBut you went nuclear instead.\n\nYes, he was stoopid. But you were stoopider. You threatened to take his wife and kids away to get him to do what you want - over a swimming pool. A fucking swimming pool. A hole in the ground filled with water you can splash in.\n\nFrom this day forward he sees you as a potential kidnapper he has to outwit, not a life partner. The trust is broken. This is no different than him saying you won't have a family unless you agree to something he wants. Of course it's controlling.  It's insulting, threatening, and generally a Very Bad Idea.\n\nBut at least you won the argument about who's gonna build the pool, right?", "ESH. He's being an ah. You are for how you handled it.  Agree the pool sounds stupid. What research has ye done? Does he have any ideas what permits this needs?", "YTA - it wasn't \"OUR\" decision, it was YOUR decision.  YOU decided he couldn't do it.  YOU issued an ultimatum of pool vs his family -- you are a GIANT AH just for this alone - how dare you make a threat like that!!!  There was no compromising.  No reaching a decision together as partners.  It's all about YOU, what YOU wanted and dictated.  It was a 1 decision - YOURS.  It was literally YOUR way or the highway.  What research did you do to answer your questions about permits, etc. to actually determine if it's a doable project or not?  Sounds like you are just ASSuming it's too big of a project and that he can't do it.   Is it a big project, yes.  Is it impossible to DYI, nope.  What would be the harm of letting him try to do it as long as there is a set schedule he needs to meet and agreement everything needs to pass any required inspections, etc.  Maybe hire a handyman or pool installer looking to make some side money to help out with the big tasks.  You might find your husband isn't as incompetent as you think and can get it done.  If he can't meet the agreed upon time lines, within reason - a day or two behind is not a show stopper, then the plan should be to hire someone to finish up.  Go apologize NOW, especially for the ultimatum! and have an adult discussion and come up with a solution that you both agree on.", "YTA from the sounds of it hes not digging that deep a hole and im not sure whats the issue However once you said pool or family you became the auto asshole that was a scummy thing to do.", "INFO: Do you know why your husband insists on building the pool? \n\nYTA (For now)\n\nIt seems like there is a reason beyond just \u201cbuilding the pool\u201d that your husband wants to build it.

Is he a lawyer, a construction worker, or what?", "YTA. It's a close call between that and ESH. It's hard to say without more information. I will put YTA as of now and then may change it if you reply clarifying some information.\n\n**\"OUR money, OUR house, and OUR yard, not his, and it's OUR decision, not his\"**\n\nIs it, really? Be honest. I know on paper it says people who are married share everything. But realistically I know there's usually a person bringing home the mass majority of the income. If he's the breadwinner and the one providing, (your house sounds rich if you're getting a pool), then I personally don't believe you have as much power as you claim you do here. So what's the living situation like? Do you both have jobs? Do only you have a job? Does only he have a job? If he a stay at home dad? I need context please.\n\nI'm also going to go against the majority and challenge your viewpoint a little. You're being hypocritical because you don't like that he wants to do his decision, while saying he should follow yours. The logic goes both ways. If it's a together decision, then you can't say what you say is final either. That's the problem with your post.\n\nThe husband most likely knows what he's doing. He wouldn't be consistent on building it himself if he wasn't prepared and didn't know the risks. You can call people to scan your yard for wires. Communication is key here.\n\n**\"I think this is a terrible idea for so many reasons.\"**\n\nSo you honestly believe the husband, who is hellbent on building a pool, didn't consider those options? My father built a pool in our yard with no experience. Of course you make calls to scan the yard and stuff like that, but I refuse to believe he's as unprepared as you make it out in this post. Communication is key here.\n\n**\"So it's either build the pool himself at the expense of his family, or have one built and keep his family. \"**\n\nThis is where YTA. What do you mean his family? The only person who is saying no is you. Not his children or anybody else. His mother may agree with you, but she's not realistically dropping her son over something this petty. You're threatening a divorce because he doesn't do what you want? Because he disagrees? Because he wants to provide for his children and save money? Yes that does sound controlling. Let the man make a pool. In my opinion, you can work out a compromise to get what you both want. You can have people check the yard for wires, etc. The bickering helps nobody.\n\nYou're free to change my mind, but this is what I think as of now.\n\n**Edit:**\n\nThe fact that I'm getting downvoted as hell but nobody has the urge to challenge or clarify just proves the initial point I was making. There's more to the story that meets the eye and you guys seem to be afraid of discussion. Also, to all of the people saying this comment is 'sexist', I will copy paste what I've been replying to everyone:\n\n\"I didn't say the man made more money, I asked a question that attempted to get more information. The point of this sub is differing opinions and finding mutual grounds. And typically speaking, there's statistics to support that men usually make more than their wives in most wealthy households.

Not have a company build it, but build it himself. He wants to buy a kit online and do all the work himself.\n\nI think this is a terrible idea for so many reasons. He knows nothing about building a pool, for one. There's the cost of renting the digging equipment and whatever other tools and equipment we would need, how it all needs to be done, permits and regulations, wtf are we going to uncover when we start to dig and how to deal with that, etc. He wants to do it for 2 reasons: \"to save money\" and \"because he can.\"\n\nWe've talked so many times about this. He knows I don't think it's a good idea. His mom agrees with me and even said she'd give us money to have a pool built, but not if he did it himself. Finally, I told him this was OUR money, OUR house, and OUR yard, not his, and it's OUR decision, not his, so it's either build the pool himself at the expense of his family, or have one built and keep his family. He chose to keep his family. \n\nFast forward a couple of weeks and he says I'm being controlling by not letting him do this. I really don't think so. Marriage is a partnership and big financial decisions should be a 2 yes and 1 no type situation. He doesn't see it that way.\n\nSo, AITA here?

Your husband seems to be completely in denial and obviously isn\u2019t considering the risks associated with such a complex project. And also, you are right to tell him that in a couple, major decisions are taken by the two people, not one only. \n\nOn the other hand, IMO I believe you have been way too far by threatening him to lose his family over this project. I understand the frustration created by someone who do not listen sensible argument but telling that you would take his entire family away, children and all? Put yourself in his shoes for a second and imagine him forcing you to surrender with such a blackmail. \n\nI guess some communication between you two needs to be re established. I hope you will get through this: a pool is a poor reason for a divorce. \n\nBest, M", "[removed]", "NTA \n\nIs there anything in the HOA bylaws about pools except no above ground ones?
