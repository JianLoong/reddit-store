Are we in a \"Be nice to AHs\" forum now? \n\nAnd writing a passive aggressive note when the neighbor is clearly the AH, because you don't have the guts to confront the guy?  \n\nI can't over look your husband's comments either.  \n\nESH.", "To keep the peace you should've just dragged it back to the neighbors yard and left it", "NTA. Your neighbors will walk over you if you let em. Your husband needs to understand this.", "NTA. They were entirely wrong and your husband should have backed you up.", "NTA, take the mattress and put it through their picture window.  And your husband is highly questionable for not defending you.", "Did you see him put it on your lawn, or did you assume? If it was from a bounce house and he has no trees in the yard, it could have blown over. ESH. You could have walked over and asked for them to get it.", "NTA. I would have just moved it back onto their lawn.", "NTA. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being passive aggressive to someone who did the same thing to you. We are a complex species with a lot of feelings. The fact that you brought it in and didn\u2019t immediately toss it back says a lot. Their mess. They should have cleaned it up. They were disrespectful to you. Treat others how they treat you.", "YTA. Is it possible they didn't know it was in your yard? There's no indication they did this on purpose with malicious intent or that they refused to move it. But that nasty note you left was a bad idea. It's one thing to get pissy with a random on the street, these people live next door to you. You could potentially start a war that you can't escape from. \n\nI don't think Dean is too unreasonable, which is why he waited for your husband instead of directly addressing you, which probably would have been a big confrontation. Maybe your husband thinks he's a jerk, too, but he did the right thing and diffused the situation.", "ESH. Dean, your husband, you.", "Mild YTA - nothing wrong with being pissed about garbage in your yard, or leaving a note about it. A passive aggressive note is where you crossed the line in my opinion. (& I wouldn't tell you if you didn't ask!) \n\nI would have dragged it back to their yard, knocked on the door & asked for them secure it because it \"must have blown into our yard\". You can diffuse a situation by leaving someone an out. (& it might have blown over there, who knows?!) The passive aggressive note just escalated things.", "YTA notes are littering too so you\u2019re no worse than they are", "YTA.

And then when he mowed his yard, it was in ours.\n\nA queen size mattress item doesn't just blow into someone else's yard.\n\nBut you know, after some comments here, I should have just brought it back over to them and said, \"Oh, are you missing something?

The thing is, Dean thought that what he did should not merit anything bad from us.\n\nLike how have we gotten to the point where someone treats you like garbage and we just have to be the bigger person?\n\nIf you are doing some bs and someone calls you on it just be accountable.

You handled it very nicely and if they don't want passive aggressive notes then they can take care of their own trash next time.", "NTA I would take pictures and then contact your local ordances and let them know of the littering issue, it may attract a fine.

I bet they would get off with a warning but it might put a stop to their shenanigans. People worry too much about a sour relationship with bad neighbors.

Ugh", "If I was you I'd pretend to misunderstand why he's upset about the note. Take the rubbish back to their house, dump it in front of their door, then knock and wait for them to answer. Then say \n\"I'm so sorry for the misunderstanding and the note. I've realised my mistake now. I'd thought you'd dumped your rubbish on my garden, but obviously only disgusting, lazy, ignorant people would do that, and you're not that like that. It obviously isn't rubbish and you must still want it. I presume you only placed it on my garden temporarily and were going to come and get it back. Then I hot my wires crossed and thought it was rubbish. So I'm correcting my mistake and returning it to you. I'm so sorry for presuming that you'd be so disgusting as to dump your rubbish on my garden.\"", "That is what you should have done!"]}
