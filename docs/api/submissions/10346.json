That's not holding a grudge that's telling the truth. \n\nFor your own self preservation I'd stick to those corrections and don't bring the topic up yourself, though. You'll drive yourself mad if you ruminate on it (without a therapist present, anyway).", "NTA. Your feelings are very valid. Should they keep bringing it up and expect you to say nothing? No way! I'm sorry they're treating you like this, it sucks!", "NTA\n\nbut it's pretty clear that they will never acknowledge that they made a wrong choice for you in this case, so either you let go of the grudge you have against them or just leave them and go either low/no contact with them. That sounds better for your own mental health.", "NTA - You\u2019re not an asshole for holding a grudge. Obviously they aren\u2019t obligated to let you stay back in your hometown, especially at 17, but you have full right to be annoyed about it since it affected your future: the thing they\u2019re meant to be most concerned about at that age.", "NTA. Your parents want to believe that they made good choices for you and didn't harm your future. They're controlling the narrative when they keep bringing it up to others.\n\nYour version of events is valid. Your story matters. Tell it until it sinks in.", "NTA\n\nIf your feelings are not good enough reason for your parents, maybe you should ask them for a money you lost because you didn't get a scolarship?", "NTA\n\nThey are lying and clearly don't feel any guilt or remorse, they just don't want a tainted image.", "NTA - But for your own mental health learn to let go.

If your parents think that having you object to their gaslighting by pointing out that it isn't working is \"awkward\" then THEY need to stop doing it.", "NTA they have done nothing to acknowledge your feelings. If they just apologised and said they could see it from your point of view, that it wasn\u2019t the best decision for you - you might be able to move past it. The problem is they probably never will, and you cannot make them. I would highly recommend therapy or counselling to help you work through your resentment. I think you are justified, but what you may end up regretting just as much is all the time you are now spending thinking and brooding on it.", "NTA! Your feelings are COMPETELY valid, and your parents are clearly trying to downplay the damage to you, rationalizing their decision to themselves. \n\nYou will probably never convince them otherwise, so if I were you, I would stop wasting any more energy trying. They have their version, and they're sticking to it, no matter what.\n\nEven if your parents continue to wrongly insist the move was good for everyone, you can continue to tell your own narrative & truth to everyone else. I think people understand that moving to a new school for the final year of high school would be tough for almost everyone -- I know a few people who did it & say it all went okay, but I know far, FAR more people who did it whose experience was similar to yours. \n\nAnd kudos to you for getting through the hard times and moving on! Whatever success you have in life from now, you know you did it despite that hurdle put in your way back then.", "Nta, it was literally 1 more year.", "Not an AH for feeling this way - but it\u2019s been ten years. You need to move on, for your own mental well-being.", "I'm not going to say anyone is an AH, because the situation sucked for everyone. As a parent, I'm guessing both of those options for staying that you outlined had costs that you may or may not have known about. For the boarding hostel, there had to be a charge, even if you think/thought it wasn't enough to make a difference (and I'm sure your parents aren't going to tell you that they couldn't afford it, or they felt it was too expensive/not a good value). \nAnd the friends parents offering to let you stay there for the year would have had costs, too. Your parents could not have expected you to stay there, reading their food, not to mention so the other costs that would increase, for free. I doubt your parents would have told you this, either.\nNot to mention, and this may be the biggest reason of all-especially for the boarding-they may not have felt like you were ready to be on your own. Both of my kids are in their mid to late 20s, and I can tell you now that I would not have allowed them to stay with a friend for an entire school year while I lived across the country. I'm sure they thought they were, but they weren't ready for that.\nI'm sorry that you didn't qualify for the same scholarships at your new home.\nDid you get federal loans for college? Didn't your parents have to take out a PLUS loan? I know we did, even though it son even qualified for the full amount of financial aid on his own allowed.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Nice of them.\n\nThe only way I can make sense of how blas\u00e9 they are about you paying for school tuition and, consequentially, incurring personal debt, is if the amount is very minimal and heavily state subsidized. Are you still paying it off?", "I wouldn\u2019t say the amount is minimal but it probably is compared to the USA. It was around $80k which is the equivalent of around $55kUSD. I am paying it off only because it gets taken out of your pay automatically at no or little interest depending on your income.  If interest was higher I would have just paid it off. \n\nThe money isn\u2019t really that big of a deal for me at this point. It was just one of the many reasons why it would have made sense to stay in my hometown.", "Hmmm... being forced to take a 50k debt would be the biggest issue for me, but since you say the financial aspect is not a biggie (despite mentioning it a lot in your main post) and could have *easily* paid it off in full earlier, I assume they have been as generous with you during college and shortly after as they were with you in HS, if gifting you a brand new car is any indication of their generosity\u2014not to diminish your own work income, but based on the salary percentage auto-deduction you mentioned, if 10yrs later you're still paying for it, then I assume it isn't your salary that's huge enough to easily cover the full debt amount. \n\nWere you still able to play on the team when you moved?\n\nSo it's really more of the social aspect. Yes, it sucks, but as parents, I can also understand why they want the family unit to move together, especially since they already have your brother flying out the nest. And it was for good reason, your father's job, and not a decision of caprice (e.g. they just want a different scenery). If they have been very generous and supportive post-move, for your own sake, maybe try to downgrade this as an unfortunate turn, rather than them maliciously wronging you and holding it as a grudge."]}
