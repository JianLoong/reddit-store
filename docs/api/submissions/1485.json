Although we were both still in love with each other we broke up because our lives were heading in different directions. Recently I have come to a point where I don't know whether I'm treating him badly and not being self-aware, or whether he's being emotionally manipulative. I've tried to write this as objectively as possible to get an accurate evaluation.\n\nPost-break-up I didn't speak to him for about four months as I found it too difficult to maintain a friendship and get over him at the same time. He called me around four months post-break-up and asked me out on a no-strings attached date, to which I agreed to go on. In the two-week lead-up to the date I texted him four times. A few days before the date he called and said that I had not been texting him enough before the date so he no longer wanted to see me.\n\nShortly after, we saw each other at a public event. We discussed whether we should get back together or not as we're both clearly still in love. I told him that I'm not in the right headspace to be in a romantic relationship with anyone for a few years but still wanted to maintain a friendship with him. He asked whether I would ever consider being in a romantic relationship with him again and I said yes, with time and a lot of personal growth for both of us. He said he would be happy to be friends as long as we talked more often than we had post-break-up.\n\nRecently we had been talking about twice a week, telling each other about updates and exciting news in our lives. He had previously said that he didn't like hearing about partners in my life but had learnt to live with it and didn't have an issue hearing about them. I told him that I had an upcoming artistic (erotic but not sexual) performance with a partner and that I was inviting most of my friends (including him). He got extremely upset and said that the more we did activities with others like that the more our potential future as romantic partners would struggle to line up. I said that I was fine to simply not mention anything similar in my life to him again so as to not upset him.\n\nMost recently he sent me a text saying that he dislikes how I've been treating him as a friend and that he thinks we should go back to being exes who don't talk. I said I respected the need for space but asked what I had done that upset him (with the only thing I can think of being not texting him frequently enough). He said he wouldn't tell me because he was done fighting for a relationship between us and that I needed to apologise for everything I've done to him (?) to even be friends.\n\nI've wanted to remain friends and feel like I've been treating him like one. It seems to me (and to the people in my life) like he only wanted to be friends in the hopes that in the future we could date again. He seems to think that the self-improvement and growth we're doing in our lives is leading up to that, and when I express otherwise he gets upset.

Eh this is a pretty sticky situation, cause it clear you guys engaged into a friendship too early when you guys still had feelings for each other. I will say its definitely a little bad to say you\u2019re not in a good headspace for a romantic relationship, and then still have partners. Unless I\u2019m reading that wrong. \n\nThen again I don\u2019t think you\u2019re in the wrong, because you guys broke up. But I think you should understand how that could hurt the other person. My personal opinion, you guys need more time apart. It sounds like the other party still very much loves you, and you need to really see where your headspace is at.", "NTA but you clearly want different things. Stop being friends and I agree with the other poster who said you need to block him in all ways. Honestly if you care about him, do this. Continuing to talk is hurting him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

He thinks y\u2019all are being friends to possibly date again and you just want to be friends and if you happen to date again, it happens. It sounds like y\u2019all are better off not being friends.", "Make a clean break, block him, he is manipulating you and blaming you when you have been clear from the get go. NTA.", "Yta. I think you should keep your distance.", "NAH, there is a clear misunderstanding between you two. Sounds like you are willing to be back with him in a distant future where you both have had time to grow and mature some more. But his expectation is to get back together in a nearer future, therefore he gets offended any time you don\u2019t take steps towards that. \n\nYou should really think deeply about what you want for you. If you don\u2019t intend to be with him, it\u2019s better to take some distance and stop getting his hopes up.", "Ehhhhhhhhhh\u2026.. Soft YTA?\n\nLet me just start by saying you both are really young and you both clearly want different things from one another, and that doesn\u2019t make either of you an a hole. \n\nAs a side note, it\u2019s just never a good thing to try and stay friends with an ex. Especially when one of you clearly still wants to be together. I\u2019ll die on this hill.\n\nHere\u2019s where I think you\u2019re maybe an a hole. He reached out to you to go on a date, and you agreed; even though the date didn\u2019t happen.\n\nLater he told you he still wants to be with you and asked if you could get back together. You said you\u2019re not in the right \u2018headspace\u2019 to date for years. Buuuut, then you say when you\u2019re talking with your ex he doesn\u2019t like to hear about your partners. So you are dating? \n\nHe asks if you guys could date in the future and you again tell him yes, but you both need to \u2018grow\u2019. You openly admit to still being in love with each other but you can\u2019t be together.\n\nThen in your last statement you say you think he was only trying to be friends with you to get together again\u2026 OBVIOUSLY! He literally asked you if that was possible and you said yes. Now you\u2019re confused as to why he thinks you\u2019re working towards that?\n\nI think you\u2019re just sending him mixed signals and you\u2019re gonna need to spell it out to him that you\u2019re not getting back together. You seem to be keeping him on a hook just in case you change your mind in the future. Honestly, do the kid a favor and cut him loose. It will probably be healthier for you both.", "NTA. He\u2019s not listening to you when you\u2019re telling him you don\u2019t want a relationship. He clearly wants to date again, and is hoping he can convince you to as well. It\u2019s not going his way, and that makes him upset.", "NTA. He\u2019s gaslighting the shit out of you. If he has \u201cprerequisites\u201d like you texting him a required number of times, he needs to use his big boy words and *communicate* with you instead of blowing up when you don\u2019t magically know his expectations. I agree that he only wants a future with you in his life as a romantic partner. You may genuinely be in love with him, but he\u2019s made it pretty clear that *his* wants and needs are the only ones that he\u2019s looking out for. Dude sounds exhausting, tbh. Block him and find a guy who listens to you and cares what you think.", "NTA \n\nYou need to make a clean break with this guy and not try to be friends anymore too .\n\nIt\u2019s clear that there is no neutral ground between you guys at all.\n\nEither you decide to be together or be apart totally", "OP, I\u2019ve been in this kind of situationship where you broke up and then tried to remain friends and yada yada. I\u2019m withholding judgement but I am going to offer some unsolicited advice. Please take it or leave it, but I do hope it helps. Clean break. No contact. It needs to be over-over for BOTH of your sakes. Neither of you deserve where you\u2019re putting the other and it will hurt you both. Walk away and rebuild \u2665\ufe0f"]}
