I just have a lot of feelings on this. \n\nI (21M) graduated with my Associate's degree (yaaay) and am finally happy to close that chapter of my life and start the next one.\n\nI'm so very proud of myself and my progress that I decided to organize a small family gathering at a local vineyard to celebrate scheduled for 2pm. I have lots of family out of town and state so I sent invites to friends and families ~6 months out so everyone could prepare in time. Most (19 out of 20) families accepted and said they would attend the gathering at 2pm. After I announced the great news to my immediate family, my older sister (25F) also announced that to \"save time and money\" she decided to take advantage of the fact that everyone's in town to have her wedding on the same weekend. \n\nI personally thought it was a smart idea to knock out two birds with one stone but she also decided to have her wedding at 2pm at a different venue the same day. I told her that my party was at 2pm too but she said I could probably have an easier time rescheduling that than a wedding. She did apologize for steamrolling over me but it still felt like a slap in my face.\n\nThe entire months leading up to the party our family has been trying to talk, guilt and persuade me to change the date but I can't (I already spent $200 to host the venue and they don't refund it) and I don't want to (it's also the date/anniversary of my best friend's death and this was something in his honor since we always joked about me not finishing school).\n\nThe day arrives and out of all of our friends and family only one person shows up to my gathering--me. I always internalized emotions growing up but this time really hurt because I spent so much resources and thought into this event just to be shadowed again by my sister. I understand that weddings are also special and meaningful but I just wanted to know and see that my family could also be proud of me too.\n\nI thought that maybe some of our family would feel a little bad about standing me up but after the wedding I got blindsided by so many messages about how I couldn't set my event aside to support my sister. One of our uncles suggested that her wedding party could've been a mini celebration for me instead of having my own party. I think this is the straw for me.\n\nI told them all exactly how I felt and what I had been feeling the whole time but my mom told me that I'm too old to be whining and trying to elicit sympathy. I told them that I'm not but it is what it is--what I feel is valid and I'm done compromising myself just to appease other people. My parents said they're disappointed that this was the hill I'm choosing to die on and that I'm letting my feelings divide and break up the family. Maybe my judgement is clouded by my emotions so I could use some third party judgement.", "created_utc": 1676692478, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115666p/aita_for_being_upset_that_no_one_came_to_my/", "score": 160, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your family should have planned a celebration.", "NTA, and i would absolutly make this the hill to die on. Whats the point in staying in contact with your family if they are a bunch of assholes? You would be better off to invest your time in finding better ppl that really care about you than spending it with a so called family who treats you as an afterthought.", "NTA your family sounds really toxic. \n\nWho takes over a party of someone else? That's just cruel. I'd go NC with your sister immediately. That was deliberately done. \n\nAs for all those people trying to invalidate your feelings: you do not have to put up with that. You scheduled a party for an important milestone in your life. People confirmed they were going to attend. That's on them. You weren't the one who were trying to ruin your sister\u2019s wedding. She was trying to ruin your graduation party. If they fall for that, good riddance. \n\nTrying to turn this into a powerplay when you probably knew already that those people were going to stand you up wasn't as smart though.

You weren't being even a little bit rational expecting a graduation party, no matter how important it is to you, to be prioritized over  a wedding, so you lost the venue money anyway.  Refusing to attend your sister's wedding and expecting anyone to skip it for your party was just completely unrealistic.  \n\nYou should have asked your sister or your parents to cover that nonrefundable deposit and then rescheduled (and perhaps made it clear they owe you a big favor for your willingness to accomodate), and if neither chose to do so and you ended up eating the cost, you could have gently told your sister that loss of the deposit meant you would be unable to spend money on her wedding or a gift.\n\nAnd as your parents suggested, this really does not make sense as a hill to die on.", "You are being gaslit by your family.

They are telling you that you are unimportant. They excepted invitations to your gathering and then did not show up.\n\nIn your shoes, I think I would reschedule my event. I would tell them the hotel that it was going to be at, the time they are expected to show up in formal attire, and that they will be fed dinner. But I wouldn\u2019t make arrangements with the hotel, let them show up and find out what it means to be stood up.\n\nIf they give you any grief about it, you can just say \u201cwhat\u2019s the big idea showing up to my events? You never did that before.\u201d", "NTA . Your sister is one tho . You planned ahead and achieved a great milestone (congratulations) and she stole the event time and date . That is someone that does not care or respect you and good on you for having that the hill to die on . For your extended family I can\u2019t blame them for attending wedding as wedding does trump your party , however would have been nice if some of them had made an attempt to go passed even if a few minutes .\n\nBut learn this as a life lesson that you don\u2019t owe anyone anything and the word family should not be something you ever be guilted upon rest of your life . Personally I wouldn\u2019t blame you for going NC with your sister", "NTA, but your parents are correct that this is a super-dumb hill to die on and a $200 rescheduling fee is just not that big a deal. You were never going to win a \u201cgraduation party v. wedding\u201d fight even if you got there first. Nor would any reasonable person expect to even if they\u2019re in the right - it\u2019s one of those situations where the crazy/rude/presumptuous person (your sister) is going to win the social battle because their event is just going to be a bigger deal. \n\nThat aside, everything else you say screams that there a lot of other issues going on.", "ESH Your sister was an AH but you were an AH to yourself.
