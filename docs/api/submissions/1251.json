I'm a rather solitary person, so I wasn't used to having someone around me constantly, and was rather low on energy in general because of this.\n\nWe were going to watch a movie, he was pretty excited about it. While I was browsing for a movie, he was playfully pushing at my shoulder. It didn't hurt at all, I think he wanted a playful reaction out of me. I was however very tired and did not feel like playing, so I told him \"could you please not do that? Thank you...\" I want to point out that I was very sweet when saying this. He immediately stopped and told me sorry, and I said it was no big deal.\n\nWe start the movie, but I notice his mood has become sullen. I asked him what's wrong, and he said \"telling me not to touch you hurt my feelings.\u201d I wanted to be considerate and said \"I understand, but I'm not feeling playful right now\u2026\u201d He insisted that I made him feel bad, because he felt he had hurt me, and I tried to explain that he didn't hurt me and wasn't angry, I just want a nice calm evening and watch the movie with him.\n\nSomehow, this gets turned around into him insinuating that I Shouldn't tell him not to touch me. I reacted at this. I said \"If I don't like something, I'm going to say something. You can't possibly expect me to just put up with discomfort, or pretend to like something just to protect your feelings?\u201d\n\nHis argument was that I Should Like To Be Touched By Him, and that I sometimes might and other times might not like something was scary for him. I said his reasoning was weird. In hindsight I can understand that he didn't want to be rejected by me if he had kind intentions, but I feel that is irrelevant - good intentions can still be hurtful!\n\nHe said \u201dThe only solution is for me to Never touch you, cause the possibility of me hurting you is SO random, from now on You set the president and touch me first.\" I argued that it would be better if I just told him how I felt, or if he was unsure to just ASK me. He refused, saying he would feel terrible asking me and then be told no.\n\nAt this I became angry, I felt he was getting near the argument of me saying No to him was not okay, that I was supposed to put my discomfort aside for his pleasure. He could tell I was getting angry, and became very defensive and started speaking loudly. I told him to \"lower your voice when speaking with me, please\". \n\nThis seemed to have been the last straw. He became furious, started crying, got up to storm out, yelling that he could not handle this. He tripped on his way out and hurt his leg, and I ended up comforting him. The situation calmed down, and we agreed to talk more about it later, and watched the movie peacefully.\n\nMy attitude towards this discussion has me wondering if ITA, because of thinking he was unreasonable and childish and not listening to me, meanwhile he felt the same way.

Run, RUN!!!", "NTA. I get emotionally exhausted just from reading this. Boyfriend needs to work on his fear of rejection.", "NTA , he sounds super immature and emotionally manipulative.", "NTA and don't light a match around that guy because he's covered in gaslighting.", "NTA - He sounds manipulative \n\nAlso fucking hilarious that he tripped running away", "He sounds like a handful and you're NTA. Maybe you should date someone a little more emotionally mature.", "NTA. Kudos for you for standing up for yourself.  He needs to look at his behavior and quit blaming you. Instead of becoming introspective about his behavior, he tried to bully you into submission.", "NTA - boundaries are boundaries. There could be a miscommunication on which type of consent you are expecting, there's \"yes until i say no\" and \"no until I say yes\". \n\nIt sounds like you fall into the \"yes until I say no\" category with an expectation that you will speak up on when these actions aren't acceptable but that you saying \"not right now\" isn't a slight against him, just a reflection on your mood. AKA he can act as he has just adjust according to what you say. It sounds like he is coming from the expectation that you won't speak up and he doesn't want to accidentally hurt you and think you were expressing a \"no until I say yes\" dynamic. This leads to him asking you to initiate/verbally express when he's got a yes. \n\n  \nIt sounds like you tried to open up a conversation to make everyone more comfortable with the situation and he's taking it as some sort of rejection. You aren't an AH but you owe him a conversation.", "Holy NTA.  What he decides he wants to try something in the bedroom that hurts or you don't like?!  Will he expect you to go along with it so his feelings dont get hurt? This has those marina flags of control, manipulation and gaslighting spread all over it.  I agree with others saying to take a long hard look at this rekationship.", "NTA\n\nYou communicated your feelings and he tried to make it all about him. Consent is important and enforcing boundaries is important and you did nothing wrong other than try to communicate with him.", "NTA.\n\nHe sounds like a child. Of course you should tell him if you are in discomfort.", "NTA.  Your boyfriend sounds like a real piece of work and I'd be seriously rethinking the relationship.", "He doesn't have the \"right\" to touch your body. Nobody does, without your consent. And consent may be withdrawn at any time.\n\nYou did great by establishing a boundary and holding firm to it so please keep that up! Someone who truly cared about you would realize that you were made uncomfortable and would want to actively improve the situation and make things better, not try to tear you down for standing up for yourself.

He just says \u201cokay, lemme know when is okay\u201d and I do. \n\nIf physical affection isn\u2019t something you\u2019re used to, then you can\u2019t be suddenly forced to get used to it. It takes time.", "NTA. Yikes. He totally overreacted and was trying to manipulate you. Maybe not intentionally, but it feels like he\u2019s used to getting his way by being overly emotional and that may be his default method of dealing with conflict.\n\nI would put this relationship in hold unless he agrees to some counseling to learn some better/healthier ways to communicate his feelings", "Wow, what a manipulative guy! You don't have to be touched by anyone for any reason. No means no. NTA", "NTA, no. You politely told him not to do something. You didn't tell him \"don't touch me\". \n\nYour boyfriend turned this around and is now playing the victim, because he can't touch you. Which is not what the situation was about at all. \n\nHe did this to himself. He could have said \"oh okay\" and just go sit on the damn couch and wait, while you were picking the movie, but instead he decided to make you feel bad about having boundaries. \n\nHe sounds immature.", "NTA\n\nBoy got issues...\n\nYour boyfriend strikes me as the kind of guy who thinks you can't r\\*pe your girlfriend or wife because they \"shouldn't be allowed to say NO to their boyfriend/husband\".\n\nHe also turned the whole thing around by saying he is uncomfortable being told no.\n\nOP, it is your body and your body autonomy he is trying to shake in its core. I don't think I would ever allow anybody to do this to me. \n\nI don't think you were inconsiderate und irrational but isn't gaslighting exactly that, making some feel inconsiderate and irrational for having/voicing his/her feelings?", "NTA at all\r  \n\r  \nYou told him nicely to stop doing something and he twisted it into something it wasn't, getting more and more worked up. Honestly it sounds like he was gaslighting the hell out of you. \r  \n\r  \nHe's very immature and may not be ready for a serious relationship yet. I've done a few LD and this would be a deal breaker for me. My last LD I married and we're still best friends 20 years later.", "NTA woooww!!! That is some major red flag manipulation going on from your bf.  He took one situation and then just blew it up into an \"all the time or never\" kind of thing!!!  How can he not distinguish between \"I'm tired and just want to relax/not in playful mood at the moment\" from \"oh my gosh never touch me again\"???  The reason is because he either doesn't have the tools to navigate his emotions when he feels slightly put out by something you say, OR he believes there IS no difference. \n\nIf that was my relationship and partner was like \"I just want to relax and watch movie\",  I would feel a tiny bit hurt, but, after thinking about it, I would understand,  and be thinking \"okay, not playful horse around time, that's okay. We can move on\".  Maybe I'd say to partner a bit later; \"in the future if I'm feeling playful, can you instead say \"can we be goofy some other time please, that would feel more comfortable to me\", if that's okay with you...and we would discuss a few hours after or the next day, just to clarify and be on the same page. \n\n That is NOT what bf did here, he blew the whole thing into a global relationship issue, when it was about your feeling tired and not playful at a certain time. This is a red flag because he is conflating your \"not in the mood MOMENT\" with your not wanting to be touched EVER and those things are NOT EQUAL IN ANY WAY. Honestly, the way he blew this up seems really toxic and you need to do some research and also to look HARD at this entire relationship.  I linked a FREE and easy to read e-book here so you CAN research the dynamics of his behavior, it may be uncomfortable to know some of these things, but if you don't want to feel like a hostage in your relationships, you need to examine behaviors and learn what is and isn't healthy for BOTH of you.  Good luck OP. \n\nhttps://archive.org/download/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat/Lundy_Why-does-he-do-that.pdf", "Well golly are those red handkerchieves falling out of his pockets?

You are used to your solitary space and decided to invite him into it. He was just trying to flirt (albeit a pretty awkward one) and now he is left far from home and feeling VERY unwelcome because you want to continue with your normal routine.", "INFO how long have you been meeting face to face? \n\nCause it sounds like the first explorations of setting boundaries, knowing what to expect from one another and feeling insecure.", "NTA\nHe is either manipulative or neurodivergent. If it's the first one you need to get out ASAP. If it's the second you need to work together to help him understand how to interact with you.", "NTA. You are a whole ass human being with feelings and thoughts and emotions and autonomy over your body. You communicated politely that his interaction with you wasn\u2019t comfortable. If he cared about making you feel comfortable, then he would have respected it. Instead, he\u2019s flipped this into being upset because, essentially, he doesn\u2019t get to play with you how he wants to. Thing is, you\u2019re not a toy. Him getting upset is (probably subconscious) manipulation, intended to make you feel bad for having autonomy and self awareness and ability to communicate it. *There is nothing bad about those things,* he just wants to be able to play with you whenever and however he wants and he doesn\u2019t want you to reject him. He needs to grow up, or y\u2019all just might not be compatible, imo.", "NTA please break up with this man", "NTA very manipulative.  I'm married and tell my husband when I just want to relax and not be bothered right after work.  He doesn't turn it around on me.  Crying in this particular situation is also emotional blackmail to get you to care to his demands.", "NTA, this guy seems outrageously immature at best, manipulative at worst. It sounds like you stated your boundaries plainly and calmly, clearly communicated your feelings, and advocated for yourself. \n\nIf it's immaturity, then he probably felt (understandably) guilty and rejected when you asked him to stop - but that's not your fault and not your problem. Sometimes that happens when someone doesn't react how you expect, and that's life? Human beings are in different moods at different times. \n\n>I Should Like To Be Touched By Him, and that I sometimes might and other times might not like something was scary for him\n\nThat's ironic because him arguing that you should always smile and put up with him touching you even when you don't want to - that your body should always be available to him to protect his feelings - is a *very scary thing for a partner to say*. \n\nI think once he cools off you need to have a discussion where you are *deadly serious* about how concerning his behavior and logic is. And if he doesn't respond with genuine remorse and understanding...it's not a good sign. He's either too immature or too entitled/manipulative to be in a relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
