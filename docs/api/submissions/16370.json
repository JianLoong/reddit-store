Sure, the 4 hour trip may be unreasonable but OP not doing anything her dads wife wants to do is immature and childish.", "This Op!

He never portrayed it like that to me.", "Yeah, I agree with ESH. OP is framing the situation as \"I want my dad to visit my baby and it's okay if Anna tags along,\" but Anna is OP's father's wife, not some random person. She isn't tagging along; she's also coming to visit the baby and is an equal participant in the trip. If the intention here really is that OP's dad visits the baby and Anna has to either shut up and deal with whatever OP plans/doesn't plan or not come, that should have been communicated (in kinder terms) to OP's dad prior to the trip so he could set realistic expectations with Anna. Sounds like he presented the trip as a family holiday, not a situation where Anna was free to come but wouldn't get any input into the itinerary at all.\n\nAt the same time, Anna should be able to realize this trip is about seeing the baby, not sight-seeing, and slow her roll a little.", "She is a plus one in the sense that she was invited by an invitee.

The plans were made for OP and her daughter and her father\u2026that\u2019s it. Anyone else attending would be a plus one\u2026..", "She is a plus one, she was invited by someone that I invited. She is allowed to ask, I am allowed to say no, and she is allowed to rent a car and do the thing anyway. She is not allowed to be upset that I won't do what she wants.", "I *am* a woman, and it has nothing to do with her gender. If a friend's boyfriend did the same thing I'd react the same way.", "Honestly this sounds like it's your dad's fault. He should've stopped funneling her requests to you when you made it clear you weren't interested in them, and talked to his wife about making their own touristy plans together or whatever in their free time in your country (since I assume you didn't have your dad's schedule planned down to every minute, there's nothing stopping him and Anna from doing stuff).\n\nAnna shouldn't have texted you directly.\n\n>she is tagging along on his trip to see his granddaughter, and she needs to be respectful of that. He said that is not how she saw it, that she saw it as more of a communal holiday and that I was harsh for what I said and an AH for sticking him in the middle.\n\nHowever Anna is viewing the trip is your dad's fault. He is the one who has communicated about this trip with her and invited her, so her perception of the trip is his fault. It's not yours, and it's not necessarily hers. Your dad needs to compromise here with both parties (you and Anna), because if he wants to bring Anna on this trip, it sounds like he and Anna occasionally will need time to do their own thing - which is totally valid when you're traveling to a different country and wanna do some different stuff (and with a 7 month old, there will be plenty of downtime). He and Anna need to work this out without involving you.", "That makes sense, but then that\u2019s on her. She reached out to you directly, not the other way around", "He can't request you have him talk to her and call you an A H for putting him in the middle. They are the same thing", "At some point, though, he should have stopped passing her requests on to you at all. He wants you to be the bad guy so he can tell her \u201csorry, OP said no,\u201d instead of telling her \u201cthis trip is for us to spend time with OP and the new baby, not for (insert thing she wants to do here), and we\u2019re not going to change our itinerary.\u201d", "I agree to an extent, but when OP told them specifically that dad\u2019s wife could rent a car and go but OP wouldn\u2019t participate, it seemed to make dad\u2019s wife mad", "He made the decision to travel there and then asked his daughter if his wife joining him is going to be a problem. Clearly the point is to visit his daughter and granddaughter.", "I was just going based on what you wrote. I could be wrong. Presumably if she is making all these plans it\u2019s because it was pitched as a vacation to her.\n\nIs she an otherwise unreasonable person? If not, then I would think that\u2019s the case. If she\u2019s always demanding and needing to control things, that\u2019s a different story, but you didn\u2019t relay that in your post, so I gave everyone the benefit of the doubt.", "That\u2019s not obvious - lots of insurance lets you lend your car to someone. \n\nI don\u2019t agree with the person you\u2019re responding to that Y T A, but I do agree with them that it\u2019s obvious your father\u2019s partner is not, in fact, welcome. Even this whole idea of calling her a \u201cplus one\u201d, a notion only relevant when planning events for which you need precise numbers, is exclusionary and meant to distance her. \n\nShe might be awful, I don\u2019t know, but you should stop pretending it\u2019s false to say that \u201cshe\u2019s not welcome\u201d.", "Perhaps using your actual choice of words in communication with her would be appropriate... I'd the picture that you were harsh and rude, and still justified.", "She's not a random plus one - she's half of a married couple. If you're inviting a married person, you're also inviting their spouse unless you specifically say \"No, I only want Dad here and Anna is specifically not invited.\" I can't imagine your dad calling your husband or your baby a plus one if he invited you to visit.", "I\u2019m sorry. But I still think you should\u2019ve behaved nicer. Nobody wants to hear that they\u2019re a \u201cplus one\u201d from the person who has invited them.", "I agree, I probably do need to talk to him about that. But also, if she views this as her own holiday, I don't understand why she keeps making suggestions that I need to be involved in. If you have a restaurant you want to go to with my dad...go, if it's your trip, I don't have to.", "True but to me it sounds like she was frustrated that OP just vetoed every single idea she had. Not saying she\u2019s right, but if I thought I was going on a vacation that included seeing family, and that family said hell no to doing absolutely anything suggested, I might be a little put off too in all honesty.", "I took that as simply asking because OP is hosting. You don\u2019t invite another person to stay in someone\u2019s home without their permission. On a normal vacation though, it doesn\u2019t mean everything you do will revolve around the host, though of course you should always be polite and invite them out, clean up after yourself, take them to dinner etc.\n\nIf this was pitched as a vacation by the dad, it makes sense why the wife was planning on doing sightseeing things.", "She is requesting to make changes all 4 would follow not just the couple. So clearly she doesn't think they would spend some of the time all together and some just the 2 of them. It sounds she simply thinks she has equal say.", "Yeah, I get that.

How you deal with your newborn and how she deals with hers shouldn\u2019t be compared. Everyone handles things differently. This trip was for her father to visit not for the family to go out and spend time outside. Op clearly states that if they want to go out and explore they can do so without her. She simply doesn\u2019t want to then she doesn\u2019t have and I think op is more frustrated and annoyed than offended by her stepmother\u2019s actions. Could she have been nicer, probably, but at the end of the day she and her dad made plans for the baby, not to have a vacation and entertain her parents outside of their home. I think had the dad specified that they wanted to also go and enjoy outside before he let the stepmom ask for demands directly to his daughter, things would\u2019ve gone smoother.

Whenever I\u2019ve been involved in going to visit family that lives elsewhere or having them visit me, it is always about both visiting family and doing fun vacation-y things in the visited location. Because the visitors are taking time off and doing all the travel work and expense. So the hosting family always wants it to be a bit fun for them. Not when meeting a brand new newborn, but just visiting a family with a baby this age? For sure. We would usually consider what would be fun and appropriate for the entire group, not ignoring one person, even a newer significant other, and treating them as an unwanted tag a long. That seems very rude.", "They\u2019ve been married 3 years. She and I are not close.", "The point is she wants to share her vacation with you and your family.

If someone invites a third party to a meal, they should just decline if they don\u2019t like the plan. If someone is invited (in this case by your dad) to a trip to a foreign country, most people will assume they get to have say or opinion in what happens to some extent.

He made you think this was a visit to spend time with you and baby.  He made Anna think this was actually going to be a vacation including sightseeing.  He should have either made it clear to you that this was a vacation for them and they'd only be spending a day, or made it clear to Anna that this trip would be focused on you and baby, with maybe a day of the two of them - without you - renting a car and going somewhere.

Honestly you should just tell your dad to go on vacation instead and yall meet up when he decides a trip for the both of you is appropriate.", "Dad, i was letting you deal with it, and you werent.\n i made myself clear, she bypasded you, i made myself clear to her, she wasnt satisfied, i put her in her place. i have the text messages to prove this sequence. \n\nNTA", "ESH\n\nThe dad\u2019s wife because she was treating it more like a fun vacation than a family visit. \n\nThe dad for not communicating with his wife the point of the visit and the itinerary was created to do things that could work with a baby in tow. \n\nYou for what you said. Ok yeah the city visit 2 hours away is a bit ridiculous of an ask. But she asked for other things. It would be nice to at least pick one thing she would like to do that is reasonable as a nice gesture since she is traveling and taking time off (assuming she works) to visit and make an effort to be part of the family. \n\nBut you literally told her she is inconsequential.

Unless you\u2019re paying for everything, you should work to be a good hostess and include everyones preferences in things like restaurants and activities. I have four kids and my parents are divorced and when they come with/without significant others we plan things together.

But I'm speaking more to who has the \"leverage\" in this scenario, for lack of a better word. \n\n\nOP is not the one wanting to hang out with Anna. She did not invite her, she would not care in the slightest if she did not come, in fact she might even prefer it. Presumably, as is the case with probably most grandparent-parent-child relationships, OP's father really wants to see his grandchild, and he's the one \"asking\" to come visit her. \n\n\nIn a situation where you're visiting your in-laws, it's probably the other way around. They want to see their son (and grandchildren if you have kids), and he wants to bring you, and so because they're the ones \"asking\", they're going to go out of the way to make you happy, even if they didn't particularly want to (it's totally possible that they do want to in your case, I'm speaking more generally).\n\n\nIt's kind of a beggers can't be choosers sort of thing. The person who's asking something of someone else can't also be the person making demands. And in most grandparent-adult child- grandchild relationships, the grandparent wants the relationship with the grandkids more than the parent wants them to, and so the parent gets to have the \"if you want to see your grandchildren you follow my rules\" kind of attitude. And when that doesn't happen we get all kinds of posts about it on this sub, of asshole grandparents who show up when a baby is born and start demanding thing as if everyone is being blessed with the privilege of their presence and not the other way around.", "I get where you\u2019re coming from, and I do agree that the parent has the upper hand in this scenario, so to speak.\n\nI think it\u2019s a shame that grandparent/grandchild relationships are weaponised like that though - and we see it happen a lot on this sub. I get it can be a tricky relationship to manage, but unless the grandparent is emotionally/physically abusive, then I think denying your child the opportunity to have a relationship with them because of perceived slights is selfish. \n\nI don\u2019t think Anna is demanding tonnes of unreasonable things, to be honest. I think the fault lies mainly with the grandfather in not communicating with Anna properly and also in OP for calling her a \u201cplus one\u201d. I can\u2019t imagine ever calling someone that to their face! \n\nYes, this is a trip to see OP and the baby, but it\u2019s par for the course that when you have visitors, you factor in what they would want to do and where they would want to go. That\u2019s just part of being a good host. I think a 4 hour round trip is unreasonable, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong of OP to put the kibosh on going on that, but it doesn\u2019t feel at all like she\u2019s interested in accommodating her visitors. I mean, who cares if a restaurant is bougie and instagrammy, if it\u2019s where Anna has her heart set on and it\u2019s kid friendly, then why not go?\n\nBut then, I\u2019d much rather go out on excursions than sit around the house all day with visitors. So perhaps OP and I are just very different individuals and thus it\u2019s harder for me to see her perspective.", "The fact that Anna is upset that OP-- who has a newborn--won't drive her to and from a town 2 hours away, and seems to take OP's suggestion that she can find a way to go there without OP driving her as an insult seems to undermine this, though."]}
