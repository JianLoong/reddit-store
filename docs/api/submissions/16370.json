Sure, the 4 hour trip may be unreasonable but OP not doing anything her dads wife wants to do is immature and childish.", "This Op!

He never portrayed it like that to me.", "Yeah, I agree with ESH. OP is framing the situation as \"I want my dad to visit my baby and it's okay if Anna tags along,\" but Anna is OP's father's wife, not some random person. She isn't tagging along; she's also coming to visit the baby and is an equal participant in the trip. If the intention here really is that OP's dad visits the baby and Anna has to either shut up and deal with whatever OP plans/doesn't plan or not come, that should have been communicated (in kinder terms) to OP's dad prior to the trip so he could set realistic expectations with Anna. Sounds like he presented the trip as a family holiday, not a situation where Anna was free to come but wouldn't get any input into the itinerary at all.\n\nAt the same time, Anna should be able to realize this trip is about seeing the baby, not sight-seeing, and slow her roll a little.", "She is a plus one in the sense that she was invited by an invitee.

The plans were made for OP and her daughter and her father\u2026that\u2019s it. Anyone else attending would be a plus one\u2026..", "She is a plus one, she was invited by someone that I invited. She is allowed to ask, I am allowed to say no, and she is allowed to rent a car and do the thing anyway. She is not allowed to be upset that I won't do what she wants.", "I *am* a woman, and it has nothing to do with her gender. If a friend's boyfriend did the same thing I'd react the same way.", "Honestly this sounds like it's your dad's fault. He should've stopped funneling her requests to you when you made it clear you weren't interested in them, and talked to his wife about making their own touristy plans together or whatever in their free time in your country (since I assume you didn't have your dad's schedule planned down to every minute, there's nothing stopping him and Anna from doing stuff).\n\nAnna shouldn't have texted you directly.\n\n>she is tagging along on his trip to see his granddaughter, and she needs to be respectful of that. He said that is not how she saw it, that she saw it as more of a communal holiday and that I was harsh for what I said and an AH for sticking him in the middle.\n\nHowever Anna is viewing the trip is your dad's fault. He is the one who has communicated about this trip with her and invited her, so her perception of the trip is his fault. It's not yours, and it's not necessarily hers. Your dad needs to compromise here with both parties (you and Anna), because if he wants to bring Anna on this trip, it sounds like he and Anna occasionally will need time to do their own thing - which is totally valid when you're traveling to a different country and wanna do some different stuff (and with a 7 month old, there will be plenty of downtime). He and Anna need to work this out without involving you.", "That makes sense, but then that\u2019s on her. She reached out to you directly, not the other way around", "He can't request you have him talk to her and call you an A H for putting him in the middle. They are the same thing", "At some point, though, he should have stopped passing her requests on to you at all. He wants you to be the bad guy so he can tell her \u201csorry, OP said no,\u201d instead of telling her \u201cthis trip is for us to spend time with OP and the new baby, not for (insert thing she wants to do here), and we\u2019re not going to change our itinerary.\u201d", "I agree to an extent, but when OP told them specifically that dad\u2019s wife could rent a car and go but OP wouldn\u2019t participate, it seemed to make dad\u2019s wife mad", "He made the decision to travel there and then asked his daughter if his wife joining him is going to be a problem. Clearly the point is to visit his daughter and granddaughter.", "I was just going based on what you wrote. I could be wrong. Presumably if she is making all these plans it\u2019s because it was pitched as a vacation to her.\n\nIs she an otherwise unreasonable person? If not, then I would think that\u2019s the case. If she\u2019s always demanding and needing to control things, that\u2019s a different story, but you didn\u2019t relay that in your post, so I gave everyone the benefit of the doubt.", "That\u2019s not obvious - lots of insurance lets you lend your car to someone. \n\nI don\u2019t agree with the person you\u2019re responding to that Y T A, but I do agree with them that it\u2019s obvious your father\u2019s partner is not, in fact, welcome. Even this whole idea of calling her a \u201cplus one\u201d, a notion only relevant when planning events for which you need precise numbers, is exclusionary and meant to distance her. \n\nShe might be awful, I don\u2019t know, but you should stop pretending it\u2019s false to say that \u201cshe\u2019s not welcome\u201d.", "Perhaps using your actual choice of words in communication with her would be appropriate... I'd the picture that you were harsh and rude, and still justified.", "She's not a random plus one - she's half of a married couple. If you're inviting a married person, you're also inviting their spouse unless you specifically say \"No, I only want Dad here and Anna is specifically not invited.\" I can't imagine your dad calling your husband or your baby a plus one if he invited you to visit.", "I\u2019m sorry. But I still think you should\u2019ve behaved nicer. Nobody wants to hear that they\u2019re a \u201cplus one\u201d from the person who has invited them.", "I agree, I probably do need to talk to him about that. But also, if she views this as her own holiday, I don't understand why she keeps making suggestions that I need to be involved in. If you have a restaurant you want to go to with my dad...go, if it's your trip, I don't have to.", "True but to me it sounds like she was frustrated that OP just vetoed every single idea she had. Not saying she\u2019s right, but if I thought I was going on a vacation that included seeing family, and that family said hell no to doing absolutely anything suggested, I might be a little put off too in all honesty.", "I took that as simply asking because OP is hosting. You don\u2019t invite another person to stay in someone\u2019s home without their permission. On a normal vacation though, it doesn\u2019t mean everything you do will revolve around the host, though of course you should always be polite and invite them out, clean up after yourself, take them to dinner etc.\n\nIf this was pitched as a vacation by the dad, it makes sense why the wife was planning on doing sightseeing things.", "She is requesting to make changes all 4 would follow not just the couple. So clearly she doesn't think they would spend some of the time all together and some just the 2 of them. It sounds she simply thinks she has equal say.", "Yeah, I get that. You're right, it may be worth a conversation with my dad to see how he saw this going.\n\nNot unreasonable, just temperamental in my experience. She's not controlling, but she does have a habit of liking to feel \"catered to\".", "When I invited my dad, he specifically asked me if it was okay if he brought her along. So I doubt he presumed she was invited.", "Yeah that's why I think your dad is failing is communicate well with her...if she wants to go to a restaurant and she suggests one to him, he and her can work out going together. Your dad can leave you out of it, other than a head's up to you that he and Anna will be doing something on their own for that period of time.", "Maybe she wants you there to conveniently forget her purse or smthng.", "Because in general it\u2019s polite to try to include your hosts in things while you\u2019re there. They don\u2019t have to be included in everything, but I feel like she kept trying because everything kept getting turned down. I honestly think your dad is at fault for whatever miscommunication of expectations happened.", "It sounds like she wants to include you in her suggestions so you don't feel left out of time with your dad. I was going to say NAH (except your dad for miscommunicating the purpose of this trip) but it sounds like you just don't want to spend time with dad's partner, who sounds eager to get to see a new country and eager to include you in those plans.", "She will try to force you to pay each time with the sob story that they spent so much money just to come see  you.", "Then OP still isn\u2019t TA, I\u2019d say the dad is for creating unrealistic expectations. It sounds like the trip was planned before deciding to bring the dad\u2019s wife. I\u2019d like some more context around that honestly. It sounds like they don\u2019t get along to start witg", "I see what you\u2019re saying, but when someone is hosting you, it is polite to invite them to join you in doing things. OP even elaborated that while the wife enjoys being catered to, she\u2019s not controlling or unreasonable in general. I really think OP\u2019s dad dropped the ball here and pitched it as an actual vacation to his wife, and not just a we\u2019re going to visit my family and all the plans have been locked down.", "That's fair and respectful of your dad to do that. I'd still like to know if you would be fine with your dad treating your baby or your husband like a plus one if he invited you to visit.", "Where are you getting that from? There's no indication of Anna expecting OP to pay for anything", "I never said OP was the AH. In my actual comment to OP I said they aren\u2019t rude for not wanting to go in excursions with a child, but also if the dad/wife are considering this a vacation, OP should expect that they will be doing things not just baby-centric or family-centric either. To me it sounds like a bit of miscommunication and mixed expectations.", "Yeah I get that, I\u2019m just saying if there was a miscommunication, that is on OPs dad. He was the one managing communication between them", "Probably why Dad got upset that they communicated directly - it sounds a bit like he sold his wife on the trip with it being a holiday which will include meeting up with family and was trying to keep the 2 sides happy-ish with different stories."]}
