I am on the border of my 1st/2nd trimester right now.\n\nCurrently in laws are visiting husband and I in our country. \n\nI got hospitalised twice with a threatened miscarriage and while baby and I are thankfully okay, I\u2019ve been put on bedrest.\n\nMIL offered to stay with us until Feb when we would\u2019ve travelled to their home for the wedding anyway. \n\n**She will still be there for most of a month before the wedding, she just won\u2019t be available to do running around errands in January**\n\n**So to be clear my MIL is absolutely not going to be missing the wedding OR the last last minute stuff OR the bridal shower etc. IN ANY WAY**\n\nI haven\u2019t said yes either way but I guess she told SIL because she reached out and was like obviously I want mum at home but if you\u2019re not well then I\u2019m happy for her to stay with you guys and I\u2019ll just figure out the rest of the wedding planning myself.\n\nI guess her fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t agree. He\u2019s been texting me saying that I\u2019m being over dramatic and I\u2019m too young to need bed rest and I\u2019m sabotaging their wedding because I can\u2019t be bothered to look after the child I already have and that I don\u2019t need accommodation for the one in me.\n\nI feel bad because my MIL has been the driving force in organising the wedding and like I guess I could just figure things out and deal with the consequences.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be the reason my SIL\u2019s wedding ends up slapdash or indeed keep her parents away from her in her last month as a singleton.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703791505, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18t26qm/aita_for_stealing_my_sils_wedding_thunder_bc_of/", "score": 2199, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s your MIL\u2019s choice to do what she feels is best.  SIL\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is being really insensitive to your needs.  I find helping out a pregnant mom on bedrest to be more important than helping to plan a wedding.  Depending on what aspects she would have been helping with, she may be able to do some of it online/on FaceTime, anyway.", "NTA That dude is being a stupid little kid. He apparently has poor understanding of preganancy. Being confined to a bed has nothing to do with age.", "NTA\nLife happens. Your SIL fianc\u00e9 is an insensitive jerk.", "As someone also currently on bedrest with a high-risk pregnancy, fuck them. You\u2019re absolutely NTA. Take the help you need and relax while you can.", "NTA\n\nIf I understand this correctly, your MIL volunteered herself to help you while you are on bedrest.  Even if you or your husband asked for here help, she still has free will and can say yes or no.  \n\nOn one hand you have an expectant mother with a child she needs help with who is on bedrest, and the other you have an adult who is planning their wedding.  While both are worthy of MIL's help, one has a medical issue and the other is just stressed.  \n\nSIL can hire someone, she can ask her Maid/Matron of honor to step up and help, and her fiance, the guy harassing you, can step up.  Why is it on the bride or her family to make all the arrangements?  The groom is also getting married and he can help out.  Who is he to say you are too young for bedrest?  Is he an Ob/Gyn?  Has he examined you?  Just where did he get his medical degree? Wile E Coyote's ACME School of Medicine?\n\nHave you spoken to your husband and MIL about this issue?  Someone needs to get this guy to back off and quit harassing you, and maybe MIL needs to go back home and help her daughter out.  Can you hire someone to help you around the house?  Do you have any friends who can help you out instead of your MIL?  What about your family?", "NTA\n\nYour MIL offered\n\nWhile your SIL may be unhappy, it sounds like she understands\n\nNot only is her fianc\u00e9 not a doctor, the reason he is mad is his family doesn\u2019t want to do any of the wedding planning grunt work and is mad your MIL won\u2019t be around to do all the running around. Basically he is mad you are inconveniencing them. \n\nWho is paying for the wedding?", "NTA. I don't anyone have a right to question your considereration in this matter, as it's your child growing in you. You and you only should be deciding in which activities you could participate and which not. I wouldn't have guts to question your solutions, or even mothers that have done their deeds wouldn't because isn't every pregnancy unique?\n\nIt's not like I know shit about expecting a baby but these are my two cents.", "Nta. You need to block him. Your husband and inlaws need to give biltobe a verbal slapdown to stop harassing you and stressing you out. He is endangering you and your unborn child. This type of stress can cause miscarriage or early labour and he needs to be told to fuck off and then keep fucking off. MIL is a grown ass woman and she is free to prioritize her grandchildren over his PARTY. Because at the end of the day that's all a big wedding is.  If he and sil can't pull their heads out of their ass to figure their own shit out and arrange their own  party or HIRE someone to help them then they are too irresponsible and incompetent to get married.", "NTA and you should inform both MIL and SIL of those messages, send them screenshots, etc. Especially SIL deserves to know what her fiance is sending to you behind her back, so she can make a proper informed decision on whether to get married or not.

That\u2019s not dramatic, it\u2019s the way things are. Your BIL is way out of line.

You have a thoughtful MIL who has offered to help you right now. If either her daughter or her daughter's fiance have a problem with this, they need to take it up with her.

You two should talk it over and come up with a plan about whether you should let SIL privately know what he's been saying (if this seems like he's doing it behind her back/without her knowledge) or flat-out tell your MIL that he's been sending you these messages and let her make her decision from there.", "NTA\n\nMake sure SIL knows what he said to you. Make sure she knows who she is marrying... Can you imagine if they have kids and he treats her like this?", "Wow. You better let SIL knows.

Your MIL is the one who offered, you have not forced her to stay and help you. Even SIL has accepted her mother's decision. Her fianc\u00e9 text to you is a huge red flag. If you haven't shown this to your husband, please do so, as what thar \"man\" has done is a form of bullying.", "I\u2019m going to say your doctor is TA, because bedrest isn\u2019t going to change the outcome of a miscarriage, and it leads to the belief that if the miscarriage occurs, it\u2019s the woman\u2019s fault somehow. Most miscarriages happen because of chromosomal issues that prevent the fetus from developing in a healthy way, and it\u2019s no one\u2019s fault, and nothing can be done to cause or prevent it. OP, get a second medical opinion if you can, your MIL can go home but she sounds like a lovely person, and your BIL is a dick.", "Ew, so this man you aren't (yet) related to in any way felt like it was ok to mansplain pregnancy at you?

He's got some nerve putting his nose in where it does not belong. He's not your doctor, nor does he have any right to input on your pregnancy.  \n\nI suspect he was counting on your MIL's helping with the wedding so he wouldn't have to lift a finger.\n\nYour MIL and SIL are both adults.

How much do you need MIL?\n\nI don\u2019t think you, MIL, or SIL are AH. Even the fiance is misguidedly trying to support SIL.\n\nI ask about your support network because of my experience losing my mom in my early twenties. \n\nI have gone through the major life milestones without her. I know, and have repeatedly proven, I can handle it without my mom involved. I know why she isn\u2019t there. I have acceptance. There are still moments I find myself wondering what it would be like if mom were around. I think SIL is in a similar place. She accepts the situation. She can\u2019t help wanting her mom just as you can\u2019t help needing her", "If her fiance cannot figure out wedding planning - he\u2019s got some nerve accusing you of not caring properly for a baby!!!\n\nI\u2019m sorry - but regardless of complications, needing help for a baby trumps a party\n\nThe irony is thick and rich here", "NTA.

You don't need the stress right now. \n\nIs there a way MIL can Skype or something similar with MIL to go over wedding plans. That way she's still helping and has less worry about how it's going.", "NTA\n\nI'm going to guess that SIL's future husband was counting on MIL's help for the wedding so he wouldn't have to do a lick of work or make a single decision.  \n\nNo one is too young for best rest and there's no drama involved.  You didn't ask your MIL for help, she volunteered.\n\nIf your SIL and her fiance can't organize their own wedding, maybe they're \"too young to get married\" and he's just being dramatic.", "I\u2019m interested if n the cultural background of OP/ OP\u2019s in laws, where MILS are in such high demand. Usually I\u2019m hearing fighting over who has to accommodate the MIL lmao", "Tell your MIL and SIL, they'll put him back in his lane.", "NTA and I'd show ypur SIL the texts from the groom. They're major red flags. If he feels comfortable treating you, a basic stranger, so poorly,  how is he going to treat SIL once they are married and he feels like he owns her and her body.

You don\u2019t have to justify your medical condition &/or it\u2019s need for accommodation to some dumbass who isn\u2019t even married yet.

Incoming BIL is entitled as F to think so.", "NTA\n Tell you SIL about her fiance's behavior. He's being completely out of line. Your SIL is understanding of the situation.  Be glad for that. Doctors don't label you high risk for nothing,  especially since exercise is so good for pregnancy when it's not high risk.", "Why the hel is the fianc\u00e9 talking to you about this???\n\nNTA.
