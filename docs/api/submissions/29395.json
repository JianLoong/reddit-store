I never said that but both kept pointing out how it was in great condition. To me that isn't relevant, if you borrow something from someone it should always be in the same condition when you return it. \n\nAITA", "created_utc": 1697908885, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17d7ktj/aita_for_taking_back_the_phone_i_lent_to_my/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was never your responsibility to do either.\n\nYour mother has a damn cheek too. You did what was her responsibility. It might be understandable that a teenager just wants the shinier thing, but your mother should know better and should be teaching your sister better, not encouraging the greed.\n\nTell your mother if she thinks your sister should have a cooler phone, when the new phone you bought her that she doesn't want is  apparently oh-so-coincidentally already broken, then oh-so-generous mom can buy your sister one herself.", "NTA.

Additionally, old phones and tablets, especially if they are only a couple of years old, usually have trade-in value so there is a cost to you for giving it to your sister. Therefore, if your parents want it for her, your parents should purchase it from you.", "NTA - your sister needs to learn boundaries.

No teenager needs a phone.  Even if she was on a trip, she was with a friend's family and I'm sure one of them had a phone for emergencies.  Mom just needs to have the family's contact information.

Sister should not have another phone for at least another year unless she pays for the thing, herself.\n3. You're not her parent.  You aren't responsible for buying her a phone.  Any phone.  If your parents want her to have a nicer phone, they can buy it for her.\n4. If the complaints continue, you should take back the cheaper phone.  She obviously doesn't appreciate any effort being done by you, so don't bother until/unless she matures.\n5. If she's already broken the new phone, absolutely don't replace it with another phone.\n6.
