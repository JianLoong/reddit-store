I packed some of it for lunch and took it to work with me the next day. I was sitting in the kitchen area at work eating my lunch and a new coworker came over and chatted me up, asked what I was eating. I said \"Korean food\" \"I love Korean food, where did you get it?\" And I said \"nowhere, my mom made it\". She raised her eyebrows, \"oh? Your MOM? Hmm. Well it looks good.\" And then went back to her desk.\n\nEVERY DAMN DAY after that, she asked some version of, \"ok, what did your mom pack for you today?\" Or \"A sandwich?? Where is the kimchi?\" (And kimchi wasn't even part of that original meal, so that wasn't great). Or one time I went out to lunch with some friends, and she saw me coming back said \"what's the matter, is your mom ok? Why didn't she pack your lunch?\" I tried to explain that my mom and I don't live together, and she does not pack my work lunch for me. It went right over her head. It was the weirdest thing, this fixation on my mother and my lunch. I don't think I'd even care that much about any of this except that she was REALLY LOUD when she talked about it, so other coworkers could definitely hear, and I don't really want people thinking I lived with my mom who packed my lunch everyday, and it's awkward to have to set that straight. I didn't have to put up with it long, she got fired shortly afterwards for clocking weekend overtime hours she did not actually work.\n\nAnother story: my dog has an Instagram and I met a friend of a friend, who has cats that have an Instagram. We swapped profiles and she was like \"oh, your dog has a lot of followers\". My dog doesn't really, she has like 400, but the cats had like 50 so I guess in comparison it seems like a lot. But then this person kept making snide remarks after that, about my dog being an influencer, how I probably think I'm too good for grocery store brand seltzer, and that I'm so busy \"creating content\" to pay attention to anything. It's tiresome. Who cares about the number of pet Instagram followers, especially when it's not even enough to generate any income.\n\nAnyways, I don't think you're being an asshole.

Freshman year I was friends with a girl who started acting differently towards me after she saw my room and after I started to branch out and make friends with other people. Mind you, this girl went home like every weekend, and so did this other girl we hung out with, and so I had to learn to bond with other people or my weekends would be spent alone. I did notice that our families obviously had different financial backgrounds, and it hurt that her perception of me changed. At the time, I didn't know how to address an issue like that so I didn't (now I would say \"I've noticed that something seems different about our friendship, and I feel like you're pulling away. have I done something to offend you?\").

I did own a few pricey items like 7 For All Manking jeans or a L.A.M.B. or Betsy Johnson bag, but I never discussed my purchases or what brand I was wearing (although sometimes it was obvious, but my mother raised me to not talk about things we buy). I also shopped a lot at Forever 21 at the time - it was probably like half my closet. I HATE when people say \"must be nice.\" It's a rancorous comment. It really used to bother me and I would feel guilty and uncomfortable. I've learned to respond with \"Yes, actually it is VERY nice.\" It's a snobby response but since the person is looking to be bothered I'll throw in something extra for them.\n\n\nThat girl is being passive aggressive. She thinks that YOU think you're \"all that.\" She thinks that YOU think you're better than her and others because of where you can afford to eat. She's foolish for continuing to ask questions with answers that clearly bother her.

If you don't respond with shame, that signals that you DO think you're better. It could be in other, better off communities, where the norm is having more resources, it might be considered socially unacceptable for someone to reveal that they are struggling financially, because it makes others feel uncomfortable or guilty.

When someone is trying to build any kind of rapport, going back to an element of a prior exchange to note familiarity is what most humans do. Even if it doesn't make a lot of sense in the current context.\n\n>\u201cyeah, that\u2019s what I typically do.\u201d\n\n>\"Must be nice.\u201d \n\nThis is perhaps the most crucial part of the interaction. Was she saying it scornfully? Enviously? Derisively? Or.... *wistfully?*\n\nWas she really saying: \"That sounds really nice. Maybe that's something we could enjoy together -- *hint, hint*...??\"\n\nAnd even if the tone/delivery *was* off, it doesn't mean she wasn't still hinting at that because, again, women can be awkward too.\n\n\n>\"Yeah, it is.\u201d And thought what a strange girl, she does not seem to understand how to have polite social interaction.\n\n>It kept seeming to happen.

She said in a vapid weird kind of way \u201cI could never afford that.\u201d\n\nAgain, it's possible she's trying to highlight the *one consistent thing* you two have talked about.\n\n \u201cWell, it\u2019s not like I invited you, so you don\u2019t need to worry about if you can afford it.\u201d \n\nOof.

No tone could really make these all those statements come across as not being passive aggressive, in my mind.\n\nWhat seals the deal for it being passive-aggressiveness, in my mind, is the fact that this girl seemingly can't help herself when it comes to making comments about OP eating at a restaurant.

For many people this will be the first time they actually interact socially with someone of another race, but also someone of other economic classes. \n\nIt's entirely possible she's just a dick.

How many followers xo you need on insta to generate income.", "I think at the time, I figured I'd get up to 1,000 followers and then look into it more seriously. I topped out at around 475, had started planning a \"500 followers, thanks for following!!!\" bullshit post. And this is after taking my dog all over NYC in all my spare time for about a month to take pics, trying to post at least one thing everyday, not being repetitive. It was a lot of work and started being no fun, when in fact hanging out and taking pictures of my dog is actually my favorite thing to do. I still had a full-time job! And also around this time I I heard somewhere that if you want a free barkbox (not pay, but just free product, and not a free subscription, one single barkbox), you need 10,000 followers. I can't 100% substantiate as I don't even remember where I heard this. And I was like... fuck this.", "Pipi In Those Abs", "Oh, wow!!!  Thanks for explaining.", "I\u2019m Scottish in Canada. I say hiya to ppl in the halls at work etc and I always get back \u2018fine, how are you?\u2019 I\u2019m sure to their ear I\u2019m asking how are you? But I\u2019m not, I\u2019m just saying hello.", "We do that in the States too (usually something like how are you or how you doing). Most people understand that it's just a social greeting and no one really wants to know how they're actually doing.", "I watch a lot of UK shows etc.  The way you describe it seems miserable!!  I know this though.  I've seen videos where people describe cultural differences.  I actually LOVE having random conversations with strangers!  One woman told me where she works, I'm not sure where but she bought my dinner too!!!  We were just standing in line at a fast food place!!", "I'm not trying to claim I'm not a dick.\n\nYou don't need to meet new people every day to be open to ideas from others. This doesn't extend to just majorly different cultures or backgrounds. A person that harbors this bad mentality will probably also make fun of people for other small things. It's called being a dick.", "I don\u2019t know if I think there\u2019s an asshole here. I take the other girl as being wistful and wishing she could do it, somewhat jealous, probably poorer based on commentary. She could be living vicariously through OP. as others said she could be autistic. She could genuinely mean no offense and just be making conversation best she can about something she wishes she could do and it\u2019s not judging the OP at all, and OP took it that way. It would explain then why the other girl would be so confused and think OP is aggressive, where OP found her to be passive aggressive. \n\nI agree with the person here who said this is a great exercise in the education of learning to communicate.", "Sounds like she's been baiting you and waiting for a chance to play the victim and wrap the indignation and sympathy of others around her like a poor lil' me blanked.\n\nI think most of us have know people like this.\n\nOP=NTA", "I find people who desire empty, shallow responses so weird. Just nod at me if that's what you want, I'll nod back, no fuss needed.", "We do that in the US too but all of OPs answers seem to be reasonable responses to me despite it being a Not Really Asking question. I don't particularly consider those Actual Answers To How I'm Doing. At most they're indicators that you could prod further if you wanted", "I think the phrase \u201cyou alright?\u201d is particular to the UK, I visited the states this year and while meeting people would say it and people would be like \u201cyeah\u2026. Why wouldn\u2019t I be? Is something wrong?\u201d", "I've actually asked people \"do you really want to know or just being polite\" and that gives them the option of a short and polite answer that's still truthful or the involved answer that may end up with us commiserating together. It made a few reevaluate how they greeted people (or at least me), and our interactions changed for the better, since I never held it against them if they were just being polite but I've always found the asking of questions for the sake of politeness unnecessarily taxing.", "That sounds like \"are you ok\" which in the states is something you ask when you're concerned about someone.", "I was a foreigner so maybe to her she was helping me assimilate. But the is as you stated and I suggested she could\u2019ve stopped asking a question and just said good morning or hello but I think she thought that doing it repeatedly would make me see the \u201cerror of my ways\u201d", "I really do believe this. Compare the comments here to, e.g., Facebook comments.", "Imo, whether or not it's hilarious is entirely dependent on if the girl in OP's dorm is trying to be sincere or if she's being intentionally passive aggressive. If the former, then it does sound like a great way to start a friendship! If the latter, then it gives her a taste of her own medicine.", "I guess it's the spirit of that comment that bothers me... I'm not fond of being vindictive regardless of how others act towards me."]}
