I packed some of it for lunch and took it to work with me the next day. I was sitting in the kitchen area at work eating my lunch and a new coworker came over and chatted me up, asked what I was eating. I said \"Korean food\" \"I love Korean food, where did you get it?\" And I said \"nowhere, my mom made it\". She raised her eyebrows, \"oh? Your MOM? Hmm. Well it looks good.\" And then went back to her desk.\n\nEVERY DAMN DAY after that, she asked some version of, \"ok, what did your mom pack for you today?\" Or \"A sandwich?? Where is the kimchi?\" (And kimchi wasn't even part of that original meal, so that wasn't great). Or one time I went out to lunch with some friends, and she saw me coming back said \"what's the matter, is your mom ok? Why didn't she pack your lunch?\" I tried to explain that my mom and I don't live together, and she does not pack my work lunch for me. It went right over her head. It was the weirdest thing, this fixation on my mother and my lunch. I don't think I'd even care that much about any of this except that she was REALLY LOUD when she talked about it, so other coworkers could definitely hear, and I don't really want people thinking I lived with my mom who packed my lunch everyday, and it's awkward to have to set that straight. I didn't have to put up with it long, she got fired shortly afterwards for clocking weekend overtime hours she did not actually work.\n\nAnother story: my dog has an Instagram and I met a friend of a friend, who has cats that have an Instagram. We swapped profiles and she was like \"oh, your dog has a lot of followers\". My dog doesn't really, she has like 400, but the cats had like 50 so I guess in comparison it seems like a lot. But then this person kept making snide remarks after that, about my dog being an influencer, how I probably think I'm too good for grocery store brand seltzer, and that I'm so busy \"creating content\" to pay attention to anything. It's tiresome. Who cares about the number of pet Instagram followers, especially when it's not even enough to generate any income.\n\nAnyways, I don't think you're being an asshole.
