Just reading how the girl asked you questions and responded to your answers about your eating a certain restaurant(s) sounded passive aggressive to me.\n\nI really don't understand the YTAs responses.  It seems like you being judge for being able to afford going to restaurants but it's just fine for her to come at you in a passive aggressive manner just because she can't afford to do the same.\n\nIn the future either ask her why is she so concerned about when and where you dine and tell her you don't talk about your business or just don't answer her at all (give her the look and walk away).", "NTA.

I don't appreciate it, nor do I appreciate your speculations on my financial decisions. Please stop making comments to me on this topic\"\n\nShe was being extremely rude by making snide comments about her perception of your eating and spending habits.

NTA \n\nAnd, if she *truly* didn't mean it in a passive aggressive way, then the only possible reason she could be commenting on it is because she does have anxiety about what she can afford.

She may not understand polite social interaction, but you clearly don't either. Your comment was unnecessary.", "You have more cash, and she recognises this and is jealous. You don't seem to recognise this, and so see her poverty as 'vapid'.

Or flat out tell her that you are uncomfortable discussing your eating habits.  Set a boundary.", "Maybe food is just her small talk go to. Lots of people talk about what they ate. \nIf you\u2019re not comfortable talking about it, that\u2019s fine, but maybe just nicely tell her that instead of making assumptions that she\u2019s attacking you and being rude to her.", "No, shes antagonistic.
