You know I can't answer during the lunch rush.\"", "NTA. He's aware of the work/personal boundaries you need to instill to do your job properly, and he's not respecting said boundaries. If he's bored, he can read a book or do a planet's worth of other activities. Let him know, lovingly and kindly, YET AGAIN, that as much as you enjoy talking with him, while you're at work is not the time to do so. He's being ridiculous.  \n\n\nAnd is he bored or checking up on you for other reasons? Is there a trust issue?  Perhaps you can tell him that \"corporate\" is observing all the chains to see if they need to make any updates to the chain's operations, and \"corporate\" observed too much phone use.

We don't have kids so I can turn my phone off if I need, and usually do when I go to bed. Not really needed but was just curious.\n\nAnywho, agree with the other posters. Set some clear boundaries and go from there.", "NTA. You have a job to do.", "I\u2019m surprised you can have your phone on you. I wasn\u2019t allowed to where I used to work. \n\nMy husband is a truck driver so we talk during the day a LOT because he gets lonely on the road. At his previous jobs I never thought I call him while he was at work because he was busy and around other people. I just don\u2019t get what\u2019s going through your husbands head that he thinks 6 phone calls while you\u2019re at work is necessary instead of excessive. Is he trying to get you fired?", "NTA. My wife has the kind of job where she can only use her phone on breaks, I have the kind where I can check use it whenever I want as long as I get my work done by 5. I think I've called her at work twice in 12 years.\n\nIt's just common sense that if someone doesn't answer their phone at work they're busy and you should just leave a message or send a text with what you need. You have very predictable busy hours and he's inconsiderate of it because he his schedule is so flexible and he's bored. I'm sure that he doesn't answer his phone when he's in the middle of something important during the work day.", "NTA - it sounds like you really do love that he thinks of you. And that\u2019s great. \nMaybe just sit down and talk with him, tell him you\u2019ll call him on your break or w/e. \n\nAlso maybe ask him of he\u2019s okay, just from personal experience. I would call my wife a lot more after a particularly bad anxiety/panic/depressive moment. And I never once told her about these moments, just called to see if she was okay and hear her voice. \nOtherwise you guys just sound like a couple that love each other.\n\nTo the other replies - The amount of people who took these comments into a partner/husband bashing direction is crazy. And you all need therapy.", "NTA. He needs to respect boundaries and be supportive of your job. Also, six calls a day? That's starting to get potentially clingy and unhealthy. Your job sounds stressful enough without him bugging you at all hours during work.", "NTA Not everyone can answer a call or text whenever they feel like and he needs to understand that.", "NTA you are at work. I had a bf once call me 38 times 5 voice mails and 10 text messages. Lets just say he is an ex now", "NTA. No joke\u2026 how do people _call_ each other? Phone calls are for emergencies. Texts are for joking and transactional communications.", "NTA, it is completely reasonable to set boundaries in a relationship like 'don't call me at work during the usual time it is super busy'. In fact, most people expect their family to not call them at work *at all* unless its an emergency. If he just wants to say 'hi' and ask how the shifts going a text will way more then suffice.", "NTA. You could get in trouble for using your phone so much at work because the other employees might use theirs too and then point to your own phone usage as justification for using theirs on the clock. Your husband is being inconsiderate and selfish.", "NTA\nCalling you 6 times a day when you are at work is ridiculous. You should tell him not to call you at work unless he has an emergency. \n\nI never call my spouse at work just to chat. I shoot him an occasional message that he can reply to when he has time. I would only call him at work if someone was hurt, dead or the house was burning down.", "NTA, but dont get mad when you find out your house burned down on the news.", "They really do.  I work in a prison, so I can't have my phone on me.  I tried dating a guy, but he would flip out and get mad that I didn't reply to his texts during the day.  He just couldn't wrap his head around the idea that some people actually can't use the phone at work.  Needless to say the relationship ended before it really began.", "My husband will do that. He will call when I'm at work (manager at a retail store) and it will go 1 of 2 ways.\n\nIf I am able to answer to ask what's up and he tells me something mundane or ask me when I'm off work. And I'm just like, this could've been a text.\n\nOr I'll ignore it and he'll text me to call him. So I worry and call him back and it's that mundane thing that he could have just asked in that text. \n\nHe is finally starting to get the hint and texts more. But also calls the second I'm supposed to be off work. And every time I am like \"when am I ever off work on time? I will call YOU when I am out.\"", "Yeah, but it sounds like she hasn't even told him yet. And I don't understand why she hasn't.", "Agreed. I work in a safety critical environment. There are real and severe consequences to being caught with your phone on you, let alone using it. Anything that can be sorted with a \"hi honey, how was your day?\" is not urgent. The husband's boredom isn't urgent either.", "Asking him not to call during the workday at all unless it\u2019s actually something important and time sensitive is a reasonable request.", "If her husband doesn't know how she feels,  because perhaps she's never told him, he's not being an ah, just a bit over the top with number of calls and texts. OP should explain why she can't talk and would rather not get calls during busy hours, or perhaps not at all. Maybe OP could give hubby a quick call on her break instead.", "I see you\u2019re point", "Yeah, when I didn\u2019t work from home my partner would text me throughout the day but NEVER expected a response unless it was a time sensitive question. Even then they never got mad if I didn\u2019t respond because they understood that work is work and you can\u2019t always. If it was really important (car broke down and I\u2019m stranded, dog got out of the yard) they\u2019d call and I\u2019d always answer because I knew if they were calling it was really urgent. If they texted me something like \u201cwhat should I defrost for dinner?\u201d Or \u201cwhere did you put my hat?\u201d And I didnt get back to them they\u2019d just\u2026 figure it out. This dude sounds needy and clingy and unable to respect his wife\u2019s job as important.", "I can\u2019t turn my phone completely off because i do have children in school and if there\u2019s an emergency i need to be reached. I also have employees who call in or don\u2019t show up and i have to call in coverage.", "Six calls a day isn't caring; it's obsessive. No one needs to know \"how you're doing\" every hour or multiple times a day. Nothing changes THAT much in a few hours.", "You\u2019re right. He\u2019s not. And i in no way meant to insinuate that he is. Maybe I\u2019ll just turn off my phone completely or put it on DND. That way it\u2019s not just him but all calls", "He knows the store phone number if i don\u2019t answer my cell and there\u2019s an emergency. But that was a little unnecessary", "She is definitely using the kid gloves on a personality type that won't get it the first or fiftieth time. She said below that she has kids too so she can't turn the phone off. Even the texts would drive me nuts if they did not have substance.", "I thought it was pretty much common sense you don't call someone at work unless it's an emergency or you've already checked that it's an ok thing to do.  After all, it's not the person's time you're taking when you call, but their employer's time, and some places can be pretty strict.", "Your*", "Just because your phone rings doesn't mean you have to answer it.  Ignore your husband's calls/texts until it is an appropriate time for you.", "We don\u2019t know that he\u2019s \u201cobsessive\u201d, and that\u2019s a big jump.  If he has a lot of downtime maybe he\u2019s just bored, and wondering if she\u2019s available.  It\u2019s not wrong to want to talk to someone you care about. Six times is excessive, but if he doesn\u2019t reach her the first time he probably figures he\u2019ll try again later.  It sounds like she hasn\u2019t actually told him not to call, so he probably doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s annoying her.  Not every relationship is falling apart on here, some people just have a simple issue, and want to know how to approach it.", "That could work, but if he\u2019s anything like my husband it could cause panic.  He might think somethings happened to you if you don\u2019t respond or he can\u2019t get the calls to go through.", "I would just explain why you can't talk, and perhaps you could call him on your break? Honesty usually is the best policy.", "You can put the school as a priority contact so it will still ring if they call.", "What was?", "That's still annoying AF because you still have to check your phone. People like this need to stop.", "True that - I didn't realize until I read much further down the thread that it seems she may not have shared her thoughts with him.  If he STILL continues the behavior after she's explained herself, then it may give \"us\" pause.  \n\nFair point - thanks! :)", "If that's really the case, then they need therapy or something. \"I'm regularly busy for a few hours at work and will not be able to check in during those times\" is not remotely unreasonable, and being able to understand that is a basic part of adult life.", "Your comment, clearly.", "I meant shutting off the phone, might make him worry.  I\u2019m not saying that would happen, I don\u2019t know them personally.  For me and my husband, if we couldn\u2019t reach each other for a few hours, even at work it would be worrisome.  I guess that\u2019s partially because of how connected the world is today.  We\u2019ve just gotten used to being able to check in whenever we want to make sure the other is okay."]}
