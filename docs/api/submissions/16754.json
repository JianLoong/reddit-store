Schedule and clear expectations imposed on me by others, rather than being left to my own devices (but helped) were what brought me out of it. These baby steps towards self sufficiency that she appears to be helping him with are probably far better help to him than being benignly \u2018taken care of\u2019 but left to hermit himself. \n\nSlowly building up a steady routine is what got me back to the land of the living.

About cooking, cleaning?", "Is he uncomfortable with the current arrangement though?", "On paper, it sounds like everything T needs. Being goalness and having zero responsibility is so counter intuitive to recovery, maintenance and stability for people with mental health issues. Part of me hopes that V knows this and is actively trying to help and OP is scared to let go of the control they have had. I don't blame OP for this, it is very hard to shake the belief that you know exactly what is best for someone you've put so much time into caring for, and it's incredibly scary letting go of that. I don't think OP is being maliciously controlling and gets a kick out of this, I genuinely think they are really scared of T being hurt and they believe they are the only person who can prevent it, ultimately hurting T in the process unintentionally. \n\nIt seems to me that both he and T need to see a professional about this as their dynamic is definitely not healthy for either of them.

It's a difficult situation all round.", "***SERIOUSLY?!?!?!*** I took psych classes as part of my business degree but I'd never presume someone's needs/condition based on them.

I\u2019m almost positive the names here are or close to the same in that one.", "Yeah I got a whole bachelors in psych and I still wouldn\u2019t presume to know what\u2019s best in this case. Yikes.", "Ahahaha... no", "Hahshahahahahahahahahah omfg no you did not just say that.\n\nYou should have left it with I know T instead of I took intro to psych 5 years ago.\n\nA fool I swear", "That doesn't qualify you to define his needs.", "LOL he needs someone that is fully trained not someone that took a few classes.  there are specialty therapists / pyschiatrists that actually are trained to deal with certain traumas.", "So you are asking her to go feed him and give him a bit of attention like someone asking a friend to check up on their dog while on vacation?", "Isn\u2019t that in a way making him do things and giving unsolicited advice? Ie. Making him eat, not trusting that he\u2019s capable of eating or sleeping on his own, making him call you?", "How does looking at him help? What does her gaze accomplish exactly? And buying an unemployed person a sandwich doesn't help them for more than a few hours. It sounds like she had much more comprehensive help in mind, but you're upset because she's not treating him with kid gloves like you would.", "Why are you with (or seemingly still want to be with) someone who you feel has taken advantage of an unwell person by making your best friend an indentured servant? If everything is as you say, then rescue him and get him out of the situation! If you could have paid his rent rather than him moving in with V, then you certainly can find a place for the two of you. If we are to take everything you say as gospel then why are you even asking AITA?", "I'mma say you're NTA, but you should all sit down and work something out together, presuming you and v stay together, otherwise just you and T. \n\nT does need to try and have his own agency and advocate for himself. I'm not saying don't help him and stuff, but he does need to try and get some self-worth. Perhaps some therapy if he isn't in any right now? Or at least working out some sort of long term plan/goal with him?", "Buddy, that could mean just about anything. You need to give better information if you want people to actually see your point of view.", "No. I think she's an ableist because I've had hip and knee problems all my life and I've been pushed to do things that hurt my body while being told it's \"all in my head.\" Maybe I read this post wrong, but that's where I'm coming from. I'm almost always in pain now.", "So you're saying he's beyond help? That your sole aim for him is that he stays alive and remembers to eat, per another response you gave? That's pretty sad. You think she's made him into a servant; I get the feeling you quite like him being so dependant on you and you're pissed off now because you see him up and doing things. Nowhere have you given us any indication of how he feels about all this, so I have to go with YTA", "Nothing is too big to solve. He needs encouragement to want to solve it, and it seems like you discourage that at every chance.", "He says he feels weird around her", "He says he feels lightheaded around her and that he constantly needs to impress her and make her happy. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s his trauma coming back. \n\nThe rules were getting up by a certain time, wearing different clothes, stuff like that. Micromanaging essentially. She once washed his hair in the bathtub because he couldn\u2019t physically do it. \n\nHe got laid off and instead of telling me about it so I could pay his rent, he let V strong arm him into living with her in exchange for doing all the chores like cooking and cleaning.", "But it isn't a difficult situation all around. It is one person making sure another doesn't get what they need. He is toxic. His absence created growth. \n\nT is getting what he needs and is growing and V is helping him financially. OP doesn't want a friend in T, he wants a dependent, that's why he's arguing for exploitation as his role has been compromised. T and OP don't need counseling, OP needs to get hands off as he's the one in control of their dynamic. If he had pushed for V's advice, the housing, and the time off, they wouldn't be in this dynamic.\n\nT chose not to tell OP he was jobless and homeless. He chose to live with V. He chose not to look for a job and stay and is improving. Now OP is back and he wants to reverse it.", "I watched an episode of M\\*A\\*S\\*H with Dr. Sydney Freeman in it (he was the unit's psychologist). Does that count?! It was the one with the young and upcoming John Ritter.", "It\u2019s not how I would put it but yes. V is too overwhelming for T", "He said he feels lightheaded around her or even thinking of her and he needs to impress her. He was almost having a panic attack when he told me.", "It's depression and OP says PTSD from adultfication, but notes because he took psych classes in college, he knows how to handle it.\n\nIt isn't anything physical. OP is infantilizing T. \n\nT's rules are to wake up at a certain time, take a shower, and change his clothes everyday. It is similar to a behavioral hospital. T used to have a job, got laid off, couldn't pay his lease, so went to live with V rent-free. While she provides, he contributes to the household. \n\nMental and physical issues are completely different and need to be treated differently.", "I\u2019m sorry you are in pain and no one has taken you seriously over the years **BUT** that still doesn't explain or excuse why you are calling his girlfriend an ableist.  \n\nThere is nowhere in the commentary that says the friend is in physical pain - reading between the lines and the \u201ctit bits\u201d that the OP decides to share does it claim any physical ailment.  \n\nThere was a comment about him having head touching sensitivity **occasionally** BUT it also **doesn\u2019t say** that GF forced the friend to wash his hair when he was experiencing one of these episodes so there is no physical element here\u2026\n\nI hope at some point you find out what is wrong with you but in the meanwhile please try not to project your issues when there no equivalence exists.", "Except she isn\u2019t doing things that hurt him. She\u2019s making him shower and wear clean clothes, and has him doing basic chores so he\u2019s not just sitting around wallowing in depression. She\u2019s actually helping him, while OP has done nothing that actually helps and seems set on keeping him down.", "He suffers from mental health disabilities not physical health disabilities (from what I can gather). As an RN, we advocate for pharmacological and non pharmacological approaches to treating mental illness. As someone who has pretty severe depression and anxiety, I\u2019ve found that a combination of medications, exercise, and therapy boost my endorphins enough. I\u2019m actually no longer on antidepressants just one anti anxiety medication. OP\u2019s friend could benefit from some structure and therapy. I know OP said in another comment that his friend is against therapy because he doesn\u2019t like to talk about his trauma. Believe me, I get that and you can\u2019t force it. He has to want it. I\u2019ve been in therapy for 3 years and I\u2019m just now starting to scratch the surface about my childhood trauma. It takes time, but it\u2019s beneficial to his emotional and physical well-being.", "I\u2019m saying that he needs help now not to be taken advantage of", "So the rules are\u2026 follow a basic living structure and proper hygiene?", "Lightheaded and needs to impress her? Sounds like a crush to me honestly. \n\nFrom what you described it seems like T was depressed and therefore isolates himself and you while trying to I assume be a good friend popped over and allowed him to stay there and alone V didn\u2019t.\n\nYou asked her to check on him and if he really didn\u2019t want to go there\u2019s very little she could do to force him. He had to of at least willingly went and moved in.\n\nAlso having been around numerous people who\u2019ve come from neglectful and bad home have set schedules and rules was a big help to them! It helped them feel a bit of control and consistency they were missing! It doesn\u2019t make T a servant if by having V there to help keep him on it if it\u2019s actually helping.", "Yeah, she's getting him out of a funk, getting him into a healthy routine that'll get him on track. He's been through adultfication and sought you to baby him, but that doesn't help him. \n\nNow that he's laid off, he can focus on his mental health. Strong arm? Seems like he went through the option of her and he's contributing while she works. Did you want him to mooch off of her instead? Lay around and waste away? He needs to keep moving especially as he's out of work. \n\nIs she helping him find work, are you? Is he looking for work?", "He was actually a psychiatrist", "He didn't say that. You sound like you're jealous she was able to give him something you couldn't.", "None of that gives me the impression she's abusing him. In fact, it kind of sounds like he has a little crush or fixation happening. Did he say he wanted to leave the apartment? Does he resent the chores? Did she do or say something to make him feel bad about himself? Because if the answers are no, you may have to face the possibility that your girlfriend actually did well here.", "That sounds like he likes your gf .", "Are these things in the comments? I don't see them in the post. I mean, that's a totally different situation to what I was responding to", "I didn't say no one has taken me seriously. He said she's making him to do things he has trouble with.\n\nI don't know where anyone is getting this dirty or need to wash thing. I responded to the post itself. If more information was added later, why not inform me instead of coming at me? I don't think my comment was uncalled for with the information given at the time. \n\nI know what is wrong with my legs. I was born with bilateral dislocated hips that weren't discovered until I was almost to the point of needing surgery to correct them. I was in braces until I was 2 and have had issues my whole life, not that that's your business.", "I'm sorry, where does it say she makes him shower and has helped him with depression? I'm not being snarky, I don't see it", "Thank you for the information. That was not in the original post. I'm guessing this information has been gathered from comments OP made and I did not see those comments.", "And I think you've been getting a little power rush from being supposedly the only one capable of helping him, handing out money for rent and keeping him dependant on you. You have been treating him like a child. I have read all of your responses and there is no indication that you have actually asked him for his opinion or about what he wants.", "YTA she is clearly not taking advantage of him.\n\nIf you got off your high (hero) horse for even a second you would see that she is helping him have a normalised life by assisting with household chores (like any housemate) and maintaining basic hygiene.\n\nYou have been enabling your friend for too long.  \n\nYou are not clearly not qualified to help him and apart from making sure he isn\u2019t dead and has a roof over his head you have done NOTHING to assist him with getting the help he needs.\n\nYour girlfriend has made progress with getting him to do basic life chores/activities and you are clearly jealous that you can no longer put on your superhero cap and drop off some food and money to him.\n\nYour girlfriend is not the one who has been taking advantage of him.  You have been taking advantage of him to make yourself feel like his protector/hero.", "Having a safe home with structure and support in exchange for doing some chores is nowhere *near* \"taking advantage.\"", "He can\u2019t eat 3 meals a day every day. It will make him throw up. Sometimes his hair is too sensitive to be touched. Sometimes his work clothes make him uncomfortable. The rigid rules don\u2019t help him", "No he\u2019s not looking for work. V says she\u2019s too busy to help him find work and she is fine with the situaiton", "if you know literally anything about trauma then you know that feeling lightheaded and like you need to impress someone, and being near panic when talking about it, is a trauma response. that doesn't mean she's abusing him, but it means that something about her or her behavior is triggering his PTSD and that is not a safe environment to be in whether or not the other person did anything wrong.", "Says who? You?", "it sounds like you might have understood what he needed at one point, but times change and people grow to need different things. now you're just being suffocating, and it's time to let go a little bit. is everyone here but you wrong? are you just the one right person in this situation? folks are all saying the same thing, and it's up to you to listen. do you want to help your friend embrace this new chapter, or do you want to hold them back? feel free to keep an eye on the situation, but take some time to acknowledge that maybe what's best for him has changed, so you'll need to change to. YTA, but only because it's hard to see a friend grow up. It's almost understandable, but the way you're handling it is almost obsessive.", "Has he told you that since being with V? Has he actually said to you this is hurting me and I want her to stop? No? Then back off and realize you might actually be hurting him more than helping. YTA for acting like T literally can\u2019t say anything for himself", "Is that what he said happened, or is this more of your freshman psychology knowledge?", "Of course she's fine with the situation, she's HELPING him. He's being active, contributing, and focusing on his mental health rather than being stifled by you or his job. How does HE feel?\n\nIf they're not looking, why aren't YOU? This is why people think you're codependent. \n\nThis experience is similar to a hospital and he NEEDS that.\n\nHas he actually been diagnosed and treated for PTSD or did you diagnose him? Just went back and saw your comments about being in psych classes in college."]}
