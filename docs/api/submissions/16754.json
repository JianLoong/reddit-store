Unless V or T crossed the line with each other romantically what\u2019s the problem? Why is this so hard for you to accept? It\u2019s comes across as if you\u2019re the only one with the problem.

Are you afraid the T is capable of more than you think? V seems to believe so, T showed her with his actions. If he can assist her he can help himself. Continue to build T up from there.

Schedule and clear expectations imposed on me by others, rather than being left to my own devices (but helped) were what brought me out of it.

About cooking, cleaning?", "Is he uncomfortable with the current arrangement though?", "On paper, it sounds like everything T needs. Being goalness and having zero responsibility is so counter intuitive to recovery, maintenance and stability for people with mental health issues. Part of me hopes that V knows this and is actively trying to help and OP is scared to let go of the control they have had. I don't blame OP for this, it is very hard to shake the belief that you know exactly what is best for someone you've put so much time into caring for, and it's incredibly scary letting go of that. I don't think OP is being maliciously controlling and gets a kick out of this, I genuinely think they are really scared of T being hurt and they believe they are the only person who can prevent it, ultimately hurting T in the process unintentionally. \n\nIt seems to me that both he and T need to see a professional about this as their dynamic is definitely not healthy for either of them.

I have multiple family members who flew across the country and paid thousands to have treatment at one of these kinds of centres.

He left home in deep, painful, crisis at the end of his rope, and returned as a whole new version of himself. Motivated, excited about his new skills and hobbies that he never would've touched before being so far out of his comfort zone, applying that balanced routine to the home environment, and with more hope and peace of mind than I'd seen in him for years.

I would go so far as to say it is irresponsible of you if your claim is true. Every negative \"YTA\" here has made some reaching assumptions about OP themselves and defined this situation as clearly in favour of the friend and gf, even though there is clearly not enough information to determine anything. There is a tonne of missing info about T's perspective, the things V has actually done or not done and what OP has actually done in the past and whether or not he has actually got the power to wield over this person in such a way that it HAS actually created a negative attachment. You are also asserting that OP is not helping in any meaningful way without ascertaining anything other than \"it sounds like she is doing this to help\" - she may well have (good intentioned, possibly) looked up on line these things and came to this conclusion to do so. This, in a vaccuum is no bad thing. Neither is, inherently, going and checking on your traumatised friend and being there for them without doing much else to help. Making judgement without doing anything to clarify a very unclear situation (one that, if you were reading carefully, also includes a ESL communication barrier here) is something you should probably cease doing if you intend to practice in hopes of actually making a career out of helping others.\n\nAnd a final point? \"I hope she breaks up with you for him, sounds like a crush\"?

When someone helps you stick to those routines and tasks it actually shows that they care. If he couldn\u2019t afford rent because he lost his job, how is offering him a place to stay a bad thing?
