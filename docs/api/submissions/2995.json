I\u2019m sure my husband has said something on here and I would just like to explain my point of view.\n\nI (26f) have a son 7 months. My husband hasn\u2019t been working for a few months now but is saying he\u2019s getting a job. He\u2019s a stay at home dad for the moment, he\u2019s good with his son. Recently he\u2019s been telling me he\u2019s stressed and just wants a break. I never complained when I had to look after the house and the baby.\n\nFew days ago I came home from work to my husband sitting on the chair in the kitchen crying with my son wailing in the living room. I\u2019d admit I\u2019ve never seen him cry that much infront of me before. I asked him what is he doing when the baby\u2019s crying. He said he\u2019s having a quick break. I yelled at him for not being there for the baby. Yes he deserves a break sometimes but not when the baby is crying. I noticed that the baby has been biting him. He wasn\u2019t answering me when I asked why is he not helping our son when he\u2019s had a break, I blurted out he\u2019s a bad father and immediately regretted it. He told me to fuck off and went upstairs with the baby. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong. He needs to be there for his son when he is clearly tired. He can\u2019t just put the baby in a play pen and call it a day and have a break for 10 minutes.

I\u2019m sure my husband has said something on here and I would just like to explain my point of view.\n\nI (26f) have a son 7 months. My husband hasn\u2019t been working for a few months now but is saying he\u2019s getting a job. He\u2019s a stay at home dad for the moment, he\u2019s good with his son. Recently he\u2019s been telling me he\u2019s stressed and just wants a break. I never complained when I had to look after the house and the baby.\n\nFew days ago I came home from work to my husband sitting on the chair in the kitchen crying with my son wailing in the living room. I\u2019d admit I\u2019ve never seen him cry that much infront of me before. I asked him what is he doing when the baby\u2019s crying. He said he\u2019s having a quick break. I yelled at him for not being there for the baby. Yes he deserves a break sometimes but not when the baby is crying. I noticed that the baby has been biting him. He wasn\u2019t answering me when I asked why is he not helping our son when he\u2019s had a break, I blurted out he\u2019s a bad father and immediately regretted it. He told me to fuck off and went upstairs with the baby. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong. He needs to be there for his son when he is clearly tired. He can\u2019t just put the baby in a play pen and call it a day and have a break for 10 minutes. I refused to talk to him until he apologises for leaving our son.\n\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Instead take the baby and give him a break. You should apologize.", "YTA. You obviously have no idea what it\u2019s like to be home with a baby everyday.

Just wait til they\u2019re a toddler and every emotion is big and leads to a breakdown and see if you\u2019re singing the same song. You owe your husband a massive apology. Just because you didn\u2019t complain to anyone doesn\u2019t mean his feelings of being overwhelmed are invalid. Does he get time away from the baby? Speaking as a former single mom, those moments were few and far between but definitely needed from time to time. He\u2019s overwhelmed, he\u2019s exhausted, he\u2019s doing everything while you\u2019re at work. And with a baby, that\u2019s a lot. You have a lot of ass kissing and groveling to do.

This is a pretty tough age with teething, learning to sit and crawl, often some changes or difficulties with sleep patterns, introducing complementary foods and also the big Separation Anxiety. Babies come first BUT only when the caregivers needs are also met. Primary caregivers need to be looked after in order to look after the baby.\n\nJust because you didn't complain doesn't mean there weren't times when you struggled and probably also thought you wanted a break.

You weren\u2019t there to help.  What would you call yourself as a mother and wife?", "YTA. He is overwhelmed. It doesn\u2019t matter that you\u2019ve NEVER felt that way. You owe him an apology.
