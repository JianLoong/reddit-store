She knew it was wrong too, which is why she kept the details secret while she was doing it. I'd be careful not to put all the blame on her though, both her and the dude are the reason those kids are dealing with a family that just blew up. He made his own choices to cheat on his wife. She's an active accessory to a broken family, but he did the breaking. You still made the right choice and she needs to feel the consequences of her choices bc yikes, in the house while the wife was home?!?!", "NTA - you have your morals and this person doesn't sound like a friend...and nor does anyone else really. Also...those people sound like acquaintances rather than friends. Found out growing up that people apply the term 'friend' to way too many people.", "I like that you stood up for what you believe but ultimately this will do you no good. Whether you come or not the family is destroyed, and same will happen with your friend in future too, so yeah i guess YTA your actions doesn't do anything for given situation, still I like you for standing up to what you believe.", "NTA. I applaud you for standing your ground on this and giving them clear, direct feedback about how wrong this situation is. Honestly, this is a group I would drop and block all together. They clearly don't see anything wrong with it meaning they would probably do the same thing Kate did in a heartbeat if the opportunity presented itself. Do you really want to be associated with these kinds of people?

I agree going to their wedding is supporting cheating. Totally fair not to go.\n\nBut blaming the woman for wrecking someone's home, rather than the husband who has an affair? That's pure misogyny.\n\nOne person here was in a relationship and chose to cheat. One person here is responsible for the demise of their family unit. Was the husband lacking agency in this, in your eyes? Unless your friend drugged him or something, then his own choices led to this result.", "NTA.  I don't think you're an arsehole for standing up for what you believe in.  Having said that, I also have a saying \"It takes two to tango.\" To assume she was the one breaking up his marriage... well that's arrogant.  He was a cheat and he would have cheated with someone else if not her.  She's a factor but he played a major part.  Maybe they are doomed for each other and you have your standards and right to state them.", "NTA. The only stand your ground rules I can endorse.", "NTA!\n\nYou spoke your truth and live by it, you should be celebrated for that.\n\nLast summer, fall and winter I went NC with my so called 'best friend', because I didn't know how to be with her after she bragged - yup, she bragged - how she stole a husband for the whole week, leaving his wife and children alone not knowing where he was.\n\nShe got my piece of mind before that, but it had no bearing on her. She contacted me after several months, only to tell that she had caught this husband cheating on HER with another woman. His wife divorced him eventually and he was left alone. My friend even rowed to the new AP's place to tell how he cheated on her with my friend.\n\nMessy story but all APs got what they deserved - a serial cheater.\n\nWhen my aunt started her affair with a married man, who had children, my grandparents disowned her. They had not raised their daughter to break families and wreak havoc. \n\nOne needs to take a stand. Absolutely. Evil happens when good people do nothing, right?", "NTA\n\nStick by your morals don\u2019t water them down because of others, I would take a look at your relationship with these girls and really look at how they have acted and their actions. You may find other red flags you looked over. My suggestion is burn this bridge", "Not only was good wife home but I presume the kids too. Both the groom and bride are special kinds of assholes.", "Holy shit I somehow completely missed the fact she was 19.

That's awfully young to fuck her/everyone else's lives up!", "This is the only way op. NTA.", "Sometimes, as we get older, we simply outgrow old friendships. Time for more compatible friendships with those who don't strain your heart and mind or try to bully you into ignoring your own moral compass. NTA op.", "That's a very healthy way to look it at. Nobody is infallible and you can choose to remain friends with somebody even if there are aspects about them you don't support or like, even if what that limit is is different for everybody. \n\nMy biggest concern is how the friend group is reacting to OP, they could have reacted like your really good friend did, but decided to attack OP instead. That's where differences like this are often irreconcilable. NTA.", "So much this.", "Seriously, OP is torturing herself over someone who isn\u2019t even a good friend. Just skip the wedding.", "I don't really understand this perspective. \"He was going to cheat anyway, so it might as well be with her.\" That doesn't absolve her of being complicit in it. That's like saying \"I was just the get away driver. He was going to rob the bank anyway, why does it matter I helped him leave?\"", "I did try to explain my point of view to them but I was shut down multiple times. I do understand that he made the choice to be unfaithful, but the fact that she KNEW. She was fully aware of his family and continued with it anyways. The blame is not all on her and mostly on him but she still knew about his family.", "1. How do you know it\u2019s an unhappy marriage? And at what point of the affair does it not become a \u201cmistake\u201d? The affair could go on for 3 years and they could create the most elaborate plan there ever is and yet it\u2019s still a \u201cmistake\u201d and not a choice? \n\n2. I\u2019m not her to answer this but if she feels this strongly about cheaters then I think she\u2019ll feel the exact same way as she already stand up for what she believes and clearly have morals so I don\u2019t see why it would be such a big difference\n\n3. She does not need these friends and she\u2019s probably better off without them.
