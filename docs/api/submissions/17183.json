People get divorced despite having children. And you don't know how their marriage was. Maybe he hated it or he was forced to marry her because she got pregnant etc. She has every right to get married to him and he had every right to fall in love and get a divorce.

She is an AH as well as all of her minions that are trying to make you feel bad. She shouldn\u2019t get too comfortable in that new wife told. If he cheated on his wife he can very well cheat on her", "NTA! She and him deserve each other and they won\u2019t last and they will probably have a kid or 2 by then and he\u2019ll wander off again so his ex wife and kids are probably better off without him to be fair.", "Listen, we're all grown ups here. Sometimes relationships don't work out & sometimes a third party is the catalyst. But a married man who will conduct an affair with a 19 y/o in his house while his wife & kids are in? Gross.\n\nYour friend will live to regret this man.\n\nStay away. NTA.", "NTA\n\nThe marriage has a higher probability of failure. So don't worry, nothing lost in a failing endeavour.", "NTA.\n\nYour friend will probably end up divorcing this guy at some point. He is super young. She is super young. It's probably infatuation at this point - not true love. Likely the infatuation will die off once every day life settles in and she will see what a mistake this is.\n\nYou are perfectly in your right to voice your opinion and not go to the wedding. Since you don't know her long and aren't close, you might consider whether this is a friendship worth having. Here, NTA.\n\nFinally, it is not your friend's fault for \"taking away the husband and father.\" That is 100% his fault. He made the choice to marry young. He made the choice to cheat. If it hadn't been with your friend, it probably would have been with someone else. So, though I generally say NTA, I think you could have stated your opinion better and think that you are light YTA for blaming your friend for her fiance's choices. It would have been better to state, \"I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable attending your wedding   knowing you guys cheated together on his wife. I wish you well.\"", "NTA. If it was true love he could have left his wife before cheating. And if she's not fussed about him leaving the kids she'll be fine when he's left with his next kids.", "NTA. She has no morals. Sounds like she just wants to leave her parents and play house.", "I think you should find new friends have good morals .from experience people who support cheating could easily cheat on you.nta", "My father cheated on my mother for over a decade, when me and my siblings were very young, including with my mom's youngest sister. It was known by, and not challenged by, their friends and family, **including some of my mother's own family**. Nobody stood up for my mom in front of her or behind her back.\n\nI \\**wish*\\*, for my mom's sake, that there were people like you around at the time, who were outspoken enough to say this is **not okay** and defend some important moral or ethical values.\n\nOP, thank you on behalf of my mom.", "It\u2019ll be a different thing when he leaves her and her children for the next 19 year old arsehole that\u2019s stupid enough to climb in his window. \n\nNTA. Be proud you do have morals. Block them all. They\u2019re not people worth knowing.", "\"they don't think her taking a father away from his children is a big deal\"\n\nThis speaks VOLUMES about these people. NTA, and cut them out of your life. They don't deserve you.", "NTA, but you should be a good friend and plan to go to her 2nd wedding \ud83d\ude0a", "Married dude is only 21 himself. I can't imagine the kids are any older, at the very most, than 4 or 5. And that's if he had them as a kid himself", "The married man is only 21.", "Barely. Dude's 21!", "Right there with you. I think the most honest decision is not to go to the wedding since you don't support the relationship. \n\nYour friend is probably going to be in for a very rough ride with this marriage, though. She's going to eventually learn that cheaters don't stop cheating - when the mistress becomes the wife, you get another mistress. I also wouldn't be surprised if he has her doing all the housework and a bunch of child care too, even if the kids hate her. If there's a substantial age gap, it's even more likely he's going to try to manipulate and take advantage of her, and until she takes off her rose colored glasses, she won't even see that that's what's happening. \n\nJust do your best to resist the urge to say something snide when she comes to you crying about finding her husband in bed with another woman.", "Second marriage at 21? What a catch!", "How old are his kids?!? These peeps just keep getting younger and younger. Yikes"]}
