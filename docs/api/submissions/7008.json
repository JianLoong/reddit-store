Our mother (F68 at death; would have been F74 now) passed away Fall 2017. She was living with my (F47) \"nice\" brother (M49) in Canada. My sister (F56 - yes Mom married really young, we are from India) and I live in the UK and our \"mean\" brother (M53) lives in the Middle East. Our Father died when we were kids. We also had a sister who died many years ago (F32 at death; we were all in India back then) who left behind a son who would have been M5 at the time. likely M28 now. However there was a big fight post-passing and his Father took the son away to his ancestral town in another part of India and we have all lost touch with him\n\nSo Mom died without a valid will or something so the Canadian courts appointed my nice brother her executor and ordered that the estate be split 5 ways. Us 4 surviving kids get 20% each and the missing nephew got another 20% as well. My nice brother also got an executor admin fee but he declined. He submitted to the courts that all of us tried to located the missing nephew for years but couldn't. But court said search again and prove it. So we spent a year doing just that and all submitting documents do the Canadian court. Finally the solicitor pursuaded the judge that missing nephew cannot be located so the estate was split 25% each surviving sibling.\n\nHowever my sister and I were determined to find him and about a year ago we did. We were all really happy about the reunion and it made the loss of our sister less painful since we got her son back. The brothers were happy as well. Nice brother said we should welcome him by giving him his share of the inheritance - in fact nice brother already set aside 1/5 of his share inheritance to give to misisng nephew if he ever appeared. \n\nHowever, my daughter (F18) somehow determined that mean brother knew where missing nephew was for years, he just didn't want to anyone to find or contact him because of the fight and some other theories we have. Anyway, the rest of us were mad at mean brother for keeping us and our nephew apart from each other. \n\nAs a result, I refused to give misisng nephew my share of his part of the inheritance because mean brother is the one who kept him away from getting it. My sister and nice brother are saying that it doesn't matter, we got money were never supposed to and we should give our nephew his share. But I disagree; we could have found him years ago were it not for mean brother - he should pay. In fact I am considering dragging his ass to court and getting missing nephew to sue him and get his ineheritane like that. My sister and nice brother said that while they don't like what mean brother did, suing would make things worse, but I think people like him need to be put in their place", "created_utc": 1673375567, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108h3yr/aita_for_refusing_to_payout_my_longlost_nephew/", "score": 99, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Missing nephew was just a child when he was taken away. He wasn't hiding from you, why are you trying to punish him? Your beef is with the \"mean\" brother, don't get your nephew involved into it.\n\nForcing nephew to sue his father so nephew could get his inheritance is even more illogical than the above.\n\nYTA.", "Sorry YTA for a couple of reasons.\n\n1.

Even if he hid that info, that\u2019s moot, now that you have located him.

And in the meantime, it's the nephew who isn't getting his fair share, presently because of you.\n\nAnd your argument doesn't even make sense, because you're not a victim here, the nephew is. If anyone should get extra money out of the whole thing, it's him. What kind of logic says that you should get restitution on his behalf?", "YTA a little. Legally you're in the clear of course. But you're punishing the son for the sins of his father/uncle...? Not great.\n\nYou cared enough to search for the nephew for years after your mother passed.

If your nephew has been found, give him his share! The only person you're hurting is your nephew and you'd be wasting his part of the inheritance taking his father (?) To court.

You either want to give your nephew his share or not. It's a moral/ethical question, not a legal one.

From what it sounds, he already has the money, he lives in a different country, and other than the word of your daughter you have no proof.
