My 7 year old sister is the one who asked me to call her mom for the video originally. She said it would make everyone happy if I did. I told her I would gladly speak on the video but I would not call her my mom. My sister asked me why and she got emotional quickly. She asked me if I didn't want to make her mom the happiest for her birthday. I told her that her mom isn't my mom and I wasn't going to call her that in a video. But I could still say how awesome she is.\n\nMy dad got involved more heavily after that. He told me the kids know how much their mom wishes I would acknowledge her as my second mom and he said if I can't do it for her milestone birthday then when am I going to. I told him never. I said we had discussed this a lot in the past and my dad said but things normally change when kids start to grow up and appreciate someone being there. I said I can appreciate my stepmom and even like her, but that doesn't mean I will ever consider her my second mom or want a second mom.\n\nMy other two siblings who are 5 and 6 were brought into the debate... I call it a debate but really it was just dad trying to get the kids to pressure me into doing what they wanted. And I know my siblings want it because they have asked before why I don't call my stepmom 'mom' and asking why I don't want her to be my mommy too. My 7 year old sister offered to share her with me. She said I shouldn't not have a mom. Which is when I explained that I do and she died.\n\nBG: My mom died when I was 7 and I was 8 when my dad married my stepmom. My half sister was born a year later. My dad and stepmom had wanted me to embrace my stepmom as more of a parental figure than I did. I saw her more like an aunt or extended family. I like her, I'll hang out with her without a complaint, I will listen if she tells me to do something. But she's not my mom, I don't call her mom or invite her to mom things for Mother's Day. We did family therapy when I was in middle school because dad wanted to address my refusal to accept her as an equal parent and mother figure. The therapist told them it was natural for some kids and healthy for some. To follow my lead and not to push or make a big deal out of it.\n\nNow it has become a big deal again. The whole thing has been going on for three weeks now and my stepmom found out about it. She was hurt that I didn't want to. She told them to leave it but my dad and sister said you could see how upset she was that I couldn't bring myself to call her mom just once for the video. My sister said I'm so mean and I should love her mom more than I love mine. My dad said my stepmom took on another woman's son and has raised me the best she could as her own. He said if I can't say the word mom for one video then I clearly hate her and want to put her in her place, and remind everyone that she's not good enough.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699352519, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17pr81a/aita_for_refusing_to_call_my_stepmom_my_mom_or_my/", "score": 716, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your dad expected your feelings to change and is now annoyed that they haven't and that's on him. If you don't want to call her mom you don't have to. I can understand your siblings not understanding because they are young and think they are being nice sharing their mom with you, but I also get how perhaps you feel it's disrespectful to your own mom. Your dad needs to stop trying to use your siblings as manipulation to get you to conform to what he wants. I recommend you and your dad go back to therapy because this is only going to continue unless he can learn to accept where you are coming from and back you up with your siblings. Barring that, prepare yourself to move as soon as possible and accept that this will negatively impact your relationship with your family permanently.\n You can love and respect your stepmother without having to call her mom. It's extremely unfair of both your dad and her to expect you to now call her mom after all these years, and sad that they don't realise their constant push for you to do so only makes you want to not do it at all. You are NTA! But please go back to therapy with your dad if you want to fix this. Goodluck and I'm really sorry you lost your mom \ud83c\udf3b", "NTA. Your father is wrong, btw. You not wanting to call her mum proves nothing of the kind. He is just frustrated that he can't have it his way. Paradoxically, it sounds as if your stepmother gets it better than he does. You can full well like her, even love her, as a trusted adult and mentor, who is close to you. That all does *not* equate to MUM. It is perfectly fine to remember your mother and have her in your mind and heart as your only mother. I hope your father reigns himself in before he ruins the relationship between the two of you completely.", "Absolutely NTA - Your family sure are though. I am so sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this. And I am so sorry for the loss of your Mum.", "NTA. Death of a parent is often harder for a child than the other parent due to the biological relationship between parent and child that spouses don't share (unless you're in Alabama \ud83d\ude2c)\n\nIf your dad won't let up, start calling him by his name instead of dad lol. Tell him you'll stop when he stops pushing the other haha.", "NTA. Your father is one of those older men who view women as interchangeable. You will never see eye to eye with him on that, because for you, your mom is NOT interchangeable with other women. And let\u2019s be honest, your stepmom did not care for you as much as your mom did. How could she? She had babies to take care of almost from the start. If you\u2019re 16, and your siblings are like 7, and your mom died when you were 8? The math says you didn\u2019t have much time alone with stepmom before she was changing diapers on other kids, and since you were so much older than the baby, you would have been expected to take care of your own needs. You were probably also expected to help with the babies. Let\u2019s be honest about another thing. If your stepmom died, your father would replace her (Or TRY to replace her), as quickly as possible, because he wouldn\u2019t want to be stuck taking care of little kids by himself. And he would fully expect the younger siblings to call the new wife \u201cMom\u201d right out the gate as well, with all of the same insensitivity that he showed to you. The problem is his misogyny, and his selfishness. He obviously put your little siblings up to this to manipulate you, but his whole reason is just to shut his wife up, cause he doesn\u2019t want to deal with her feelings. He will NEVER EVER admit that he has done anything wrong. That is who he is. I say maintain your integrity. You can be respectful and grateful to your stepmom without pretending that she gave birth to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You will look back and realize you are hurting her and making drama for no reason when you could have simply just said \"mom\" once in your life. I am sure your real mother would have liked you to be kind in this situation instead", "I'm going to go against the grain a bit here and go with NAH. There's just a group of human beings, each with their own feelings, and they're all valid in this instance.\n\nStepmom isn't an AH in this situation. By OP's own account, she's done the best she could in the way OP would allow her to. It actually seems like OP holds a special place in her heart, even though he isn't her biological child. Coming into the marriage, she thought she couldn't have children (guess the ex was shooting blanks), so she thought that OP would be the closest thing she'd ever have to her own child. Thankfully, she's been blessed to have children of her own now, but it really seems like the place in her heart for OP wasn't diminished by that. OP himself has had nothing but kind words for her & the role she's played, other than not considering her as a mother figure. It's understandable that she's a little hurt by OP's rejection of her as a mother figure. He's perfectly valid to feel that way, but she's equally valid to be hurt by that.\n\nObviously, OP's half-siblings are way too young to be AHs anyway, but they wouldn't be regardless. Obviously their feelings towards stepmom are going to be different because she's their biological mother. But I get a sense as well that they view OP as just a regular sibling rather than a half-sibling. And they feel that OP accepting their mother would be part of making them a full family. And they are valid to feel that way. OP is also valid in not feeling that way. Neither of them are the AH for that. I will say that I get the sense that OP does care about his half-siblings and I don't think there's any resentment there.\n\nDad isn't an AH either. I'm sure he still grieves the loss of OP's mother. Dying that young will always be hard on the people left behind. Everyone processes grief in their own way too. I don't think at all that dad has forgotten about mom or tried to just replace her. Once his wife died though, he now bore sole responsibility for his son. He may have actually found it quite difficult to do, but he had to be able to move on and pick himself back up for the sake of his son. Did things happen quickly after that? Sure. But sometimes they just do. He ended up marrying someone who seems to have been a great mother to the children they would have together while also helping him to raise his son, who was not her biological child but who she was willing to help raise anyway. I think dad's feelings are that OP accepting her as a mother figure would be a way of acknowledging the fact that, whether OP is able to see it this way or not, she did play at least a fair amount of a mother figure in his life. Dad's feelings in that are a bit misguided, but still valid to have.\n\nOP also isn't an AH. Once again, everyone processes grief differently and in their own time. It's very clear that he was profoundly affected by the death of his mother. Losing her at such a young age would be absolutely devastating. It seems like OP harbors some resentment over his mother's death that persists to this day, which is again perfectly understandable. To me, it feels like OP believes that allowing anyone else to be a mother figure in his heart would be dishonoring her memory. He's valid to feel that way, because that's part of his grieving process. And his inability to consider stepmom as a mother figure doesn't really make him an AH either.\n\nIf I could offer just a bit of advice to OP as a parent myself, I would say that one of the things that parents (at least good ones) want most for their children is to be happy, in whatever form that takes. If something were to happen to me, I would still want my children to be happy. If my wife were to remarry, I would be happy to have them see him as a father figure if that makes them happy. I know how important both mothers AND fathers truly are. If they never accept him as a father figure, I'd be okay with that too, as long as they are happy and as long as they still show gratitude for the role that he's playing, even if they can't accept him fully as their father.\n\nHonestly, I wish you all the best of luck. This is a really difficult situation and there are a lot of feelings that conflict with each other without any of them truly being wrong.", "NTA but don't cut off your nose to spite your face.

I know how this sub is and Im ready to take all your downvotes for this take.\n\nFrankly I blame the therapist for this situation.

This approach does nothing to help the individual. Rather a good therapist should help a person identify where those feelings are coming from and why the patient feels them. Then help them to realize how those feelings are negatively impacting the patients day to day lives and develop strategies to change those feelings to channel them into more positive directions.", "NTA.

We have all lived together since she was 3 1/2 and when she was about 7 a year after we got her back home she decided he was daddy. The therapist said to let her call him what she was comfortable with unless he wasn't comfortable being called that. She's 13, the moodiest of moody teens, he is not her favorite person (because every teen needs a parent to rail against according to the therapist), she considers him to be a pain in her ass and resents his existence in her bubble. But she still calls him dad. She's never stopped. She picked him and he is dad and her other dad is literally referred to as 'state he lives in' dad. And I don't encourage anything but harmony and calm, I encourage her to text her bio parent or call she just doesn't care to. \n\nAll that is to say she CHOSE for him to be her dad and if she hadn't it doesn't negate or remove the part he's played as her parent.
