My 7 year old sister is the one who asked me to call her mom for the video originally. She said it would make everyone happy if I did. I told her I would gladly speak on the video but I would not call her my mom. My sister asked me why and she got emotional quickly. She asked me if I didn't want to make her mom the happiest for her birthday. I told her that her mom isn't my mom and I wasn't going to call her that in a video. But I could still say how awesome she is.\n\nMy dad got involved more heavily after that. He told me the kids know how much their mom wishes I would acknowledge her as my second mom and he said if I can't do it for her milestone birthday then when am I going to. I told him never. I said we had discussed this a lot in the past and my dad said but things normally change when kids start to grow up and appreciate someone being there. I said I can appreciate my stepmom and even like her, but that doesn't mean I will ever consider her my second mom or want a second mom.\n\nMy other two siblings who are 5 and 6 were brought into the debate... I call it a debate but really it was just dad trying to get the kids to pressure me into doing what they wanted. And I know my siblings want it because they have asked before why I don't call my stepmom 'mom' and asking why I don't want her to be my mommy too. My 7 year old sister offered to share her with me. She said I shouldn't not have a mom. Which is when I explained that I do and she died.\n\nBG: My mom died when I was 7 and I was 8 when my dad married my stepmom. My half sister was born a year later. My dad and stepmom had wanted me to embrace my stepmom as more of a parental figure than I did. I saw her more like an aunt or extended family. I like her, I'll hang out with her without a complaint, I will listen if she tells me to do something. But she's not my mom, I don't call her mom or invite her to mom things for Mother's Day. We did family therapy when I was in middle school because dad wanted to address my refusal to accept her as an equal parent and mother figure. The therapist told them it was natural for some kids and healthy for some. To follow my lead and not to push or make a big deal out of it.\n\nNow it has become a big deal again. The whole thing has been going on for three weeks now and my stepmom found out about it. She was hurt that I didn't want to. She told them to leave it but my dad and sister said you could see how upset she was that I couldn't bring myself to call her mom just once for the video. My sister said I'm so mean and I should love her mom more than I love mine. My dad said my stepmom took on another woman's son and has raised me the best she could as her own. He said if I can't say the word mom for one video then I clearly hate her and want to put her in her place, and remind everyone that she's not good enough.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699352519, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17pr81a/aita_for_refusing_to_call_my_stepmom_my_mom_or_my/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But you still remember and love your mom, and don't want to call another woman \"Mom.\" You still have the pain of losing your mom, and that is normal and okay. And it's normal and okay for you to not want to call another woman \"mom\" no matter how much you care for her. I think your dad needs to hear all of this.", "Sorry you're going through this my dude.\n\nYour post is thoughtful, respectful and honest. I'm just gonna say, you clearly go that from your mom.\n\nIt's shite that your dad is using your halfs to try to bring the family together.... when in fact he's making them the wedge that will break it apart.\n\nYou don't say how old you are but be prepared for the major change across the board, if they don't force you to change your mind.

Them trying to pressure you into doing that is AHy though. \n\nYou can tell your stepmother how much you appreciate her and care for her, and you can give an emotional speech about that on the video without necessarily calling her mom. \n\nAnd even if you caved in and called her mom on the video, I don't think that would be the end of it. And think they'd demand you call her mom from then on.\n\nTry talking to your stepmom. Let her know how much she means to you, but that you can't call any other woman \"mom\". Tell her how that makes you feel and I'm sure  she'll understand and maybe even tell her husband to stop pressuring you.", "NTA. But your dad is. To put pressure on you to say \"Mom\" to someone who you dont see as your mother, is not okay. You said, you talked about this issue in therapy and they still dont respect your feelings. I have a bad feeling about this whole \"Video tribute\" thing and would expect that they want it to show EVERYONE how you finally said Mom to her! Like a trained puppy. But you are not their puppy! You are a person and they dont respect you and your feelings.", "\r  \nNavigating complex family dynamics, particularly involving stepparents, is always emotionally intricate. Your situation, rooted in the loss of your biological mother and the subsequent arrival of your stepmom, has created a unique family dynamic that's sensitive and deeply personal to you. While your family members are aiming to honor your stepmom in a video tribute, your choice not to refer to her as \"mom\" isn't a reflection of hate or disrespect, but rather a way to preserve the memory of your biological mother and maintain your emotional boundaries. Expressing appreciation and gratitude for your stepmom in the video without using the term \"mom\" should be understood and respected, as it's about acknowledging the role she plays in your life in a manner that's true to your feelings and experiences.", "Cat is a cat. Chair is a chair. Mom is a mom. That's up to you what do you feel. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYour stepmother has a role in your live, you listen to her and do things with her. But you also have another mom who you don't want to give up.

Just because your dad and stepmom decided to get together doesn\u2019t mean that she instantly gains a free child. You have to accept that person in the role and if you don\u2019t that\u2019s totally understandable, you still consider her family just not \u2018Mom\u2019.  As for the statement of took on another woman\u2019s son, what she did was take on her new husbands son.

She is not your Mum and will never be your Mum. That honour belongs only to your real Mum who sadly passed away.\n\nIf you do take part, say some nice things but refer to her by name.", "NTA!!!\n\n\nWhat your family is trying to do to you is very manipulative and unfair!! Your dad expected your feelings to change and is now annoyed that they haven't and that's on him. If you don't want to call her mom you don't have to. I can understand your siblings not understanding because they are young and think they are being nice sharing their mom with you, but I also get how perhaps you feel it's disrespectful to your own mom. Your dad needs to stop trying to use your siblings as manipulation to get you to conform to what he wants. I recommend you and your dad go back to therapy because this is only going to continue unless he can learn to accept where you are coming from and back you up with your siblings. Barring that, prepare yourself to move as soon as possible and accept that this will negatively impact your relationship with your family permanently.\n You can love and respect your stepmother without having to call her mom. It's extremely unfair of both your dad and her to expect you to now call her mom after all these years, and sad that they don't realise their constant push for you to do so only makes you want to not do it at all. You are NTA! But please go back to therapy with your dad if you want to fix this. Goodluck and I'm really sorry you lost your mom \ud83c\udf3b", "NTA. Your father is wrong, btw. You not wanting to call her mum proves nothing of the kind. He is just frustrated that he can't have it his way. Paradoxically, it sounds as if your stepmother gets it better than he does. You can full well like her, even love her, as a trusted adult and mentor, who is close to you. That all does *not* equate to MUM. It is perfectly fine to remember your mother and have her in your mind and heart as your only mother. I hope your father reigns himself in before he ruins the relationship between the two of you completely.", "Absolutely NTA - Your family sure are though. I am so sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this. And I am so sorry for the loss of your Mum.", "NTA. Death of a parent is often harder for a child than the other parent due to the biological relationship between parent and child that spouses don't share (unless you're in Alabama \ud83d\ude2c)\n\nIf your dad won't let up, start calling him by his name instead of dad lol. Tell him you'll stop when he stops pushing the other haha.", "NTA. Your father is one of those older men who view women as interchangeable. You will never see eye to eye with him on that, because for you, your mom is NOT interchangeable with other women. And let\u2019s be honest, your stepmom did not care for you as much as your mom did. How could she? She had babies to take care of almost from the start. If you\u2019re 16, and your siblings are like 7, and your mom died when you were 8? The math says you didn\u2019t have much time alone with stepmom before she was changing diapers on other kids, and since you were so much older than the baby, you would have been expected to take care of your own needs. You were probably also expected to help with the babies. Let\u2019s be honest about another thing. If your stepmom died, your father would replace her (Or TRY to replace her), as quickly as possible, because he wouldn\u2019t want to be stuck taking care of little kids by himself. And he would fully expect the younger siblings to call the new wife \u201cMom\u201d right out the gate as well, with all of the same insensitivity that he showed to you. The problem is his misogyny, and his selfishness. He obviously put your little siblings up to this to manipulate you, but his whole reason is just to shut his wife up, cause he doesn\u2019t want to deal with her feelings. He will NEVER EVER admit that he has done anything wrong. That is who he is. I say maintain your integrity. You can be respectful and grateful to your stepmom without pretending that she gave birth to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Calling my stepmom \"mom\" is not something I will ever do and not because of her, but I won't ever call anyone else my mom other than my mom.", "I told them I would say good things about her but it wasn't enough. They didn't feel it was showing her enough appreciation and acknowledging her the way they feel she deserves to be acknowledged.", "It's way too much. I won't ever call someone else my mom.", "Ungrateful brat because he doesn't see this woman as his mother and won't call her mom...seriously? Wtf!! She may very well have done a good job as a stepmom and that is great...but that doesn't mean that the step HAS  to be dropped from her title. She's his stepmother...that how he sees her, that is how he feels about her.  \n\nNTA. No one can force you to feel something you don't feel. As long as you show her the respect she deserves then there really shouldn't be anyone pressuring you to make her feel like something she is not. And using the kids makes your father a huge AH.", "She didn't step totally into a mother role but that was because I didn't want her to. She does caregiver stuff but not a full parental responsibility role either.\n\nI don't want her to take the role as a mother in my life either. That has never changed. It's nothing to do with her personally. I would feel that way about anyone else.", "She accepts that I feel the way I do and that she can't be my mom. But it disappoints her a lot. She wants to be embraced as my second mom and clearly she really would love to hear me call her my mom. I don't know if anything will change when this stuff was already discussed in therapy before.", "Thanks and yeah, I get along really well with her and I could say a ton of nice stuff about her but it's not enough.", "I like that it was your choice. Any of my friends who call their stepparent mom/dad only do it because it was never pressured or coerced out of them.", "We went to therapy together before. I don't think another session will make him actually hear me. He will just expect me to change my mind again once he thinks enough time has passed.", "I do have contact with my mom's family. They're my only extended family since my dad is an only child with parents who don't care. The last time I remember meeting my parents was when my mom was still alive and they called me the wrong name after saying I couldn't be their grandkid since their grandkid \"would be a teenager now\".\n\nMy siblings know I have a different mom and that her family is in my life. I think they picked up on my dad and stepmom's feelings about her being my second mom though.", "Mom is a name not just a title\n\nI can't imagine anyone wanting to take that name\n\n\nI'd ask for mamma or m-dukes or something", "Sorry you\u2019re going through this. Ask your dad why your stepmom\u2019s feelings are the only ones that should be considered and yours shouldn\u2019t. Why can\u2019t your stepmom get over her temporary feeling of not understanding your grief? It\u2019s selfish of your dad to put this kind of guilt and pressure on you. How would he explain the pressure he\u2019s putting on you to your mother?", "i think in your shoes I would stop calling that AH \"dad\" and use Mr. Lastname. You are NTA. \nLet him know he is evil and selfish for pushing a child to forget their own mother so to treat them both equally he is now Mr. Lastname and no longer dad.", "Hang in there, 2 more years!", "Do you have any other relatives who might be able to help? Your grandparents or aunts and oncles? Someone needs to tell your father that what he's doing is not right. \n\nI'm glad that your stepmom at least didn't wanna push it even though it makes her sad, that's why I suggested you talk to her again because she might understand. But the real problem here is your father for trying to force to do something you don't want to, and for using his little kids to pressure you.", "Therapy isn\u2019t meant to change anyone\u2019s feelings. It\u2019s to help us understand our feelings so that we can adaptively cope with them. It sounds like both you and your stepmom paid attention to therapy and learned something from it - but your dad certainly didn\u2019t. Sadly there\u2019s not much you can do about that. \n\nYou\u2019re not an AH here. Your dad is trying to emotionally manipulate you and it\u2019s really gross and scummy. I\u2019m sorry he\u2019s doing that. You can\u2019t make him stop (you cant control the behaviour of another person) but you can repeat the following: \u201cI will not be emotionally blackmailed into calling her mom. She is family* but she isn\u2019t my mom and I respect her and myself too much to lie about my feelings. I wish you respected us enough to accept this but I can\u2019t force you to.\u201d \n\n(I saw in another comment that you consider her kind of like an aunt, so I\u2019m assuming you consider her family but don\u2019t say that either if it\u2019s not true). \n\nAt the end of the day, you\u2019re allowed to feel however you want about your stepmom, and she\u2019s allowed to feel however she wants about not being called \u201cmom\u201d. But you are not responsible for managing the emotions of another person. If she\u2019s unable to cope with the sadness, she needs further therapy - she doesn\u2019t need her stepchild lying in order to coddle her feelings. You\u2019re both worth more than that.", "Could you ask your dad how he would feel if he died and his wife forced his younger kids to replace him with another man as their dad? Ask him if that scenario makes him smile?", "Really, it's like you haven't read my comment. In my book you can be right and be an asshole - he got gain from her work without ( as i see it now ) giving back. She haven't born him to this world and yet she worked hard for him to grow in functional family. He could call her mom in person and not forget to tell people she is his step-mother ( people use diminutives all the times, how many Samuels is know to people as Sam ? ). I will not pack on the back people displaying this kind of behaviour.", "Well why is everyone else getting involved with this. Flipping heck. Sounds like drama creation. I\u2019d just keep checking in with her and say something really nice, this demonstrates your a good writer, maybe write whatever you record in a letter for her too with something a bit more. Must be hard and sorry your under this pressure sounds like your doing the right thing. Your affection and way of seeing things isn\u2019t something that\u2019s to be traded for a cute birthday video", "I don't think he would give me an honest answer and he might get mad at me for saying it like that.", "My dad's parents are not really around and they don't give a shit about my dad or about their grandkids. My mom's family would but I think my dad would be more angry if I involved them in this. He would say they would never be on my stepmom's side.", "I consider her family. I don't consider her like the core family (mom + dad + kids) kinda family. But I think she's an awesome person and I enjoy having her in my life. She was never a parent like closeness to me though.", "I don't think he would like me asking him that. Plus I can see him lying to my face and saying he would love that. But I know it would bother him.", "He was a CHILD. It's not his responsibility to \"give back\" to a woman who married a man who already had a child. What she did should be expected of all step parents. He's neither wrong, nor the AH.\n\nShe's not his mom, he doesn't want to call her mom, not in person, not in a video. If OP's mother was still alive would you feel the same way?", "You should ask for family therapy again.\nMaybe being told, AGAIN, to leave you alone on the matter would help.\nAs for your sister, I would tell her how she would feel about someone telling her to call someone other than her mom mom.", "It depends on the responsibility split. Have you read my comment? I put some words about how she helped his father raise him.\n\nHell, there is difference between mom and mother. How many times people call parent of their spouse a mom/dad?"]}
