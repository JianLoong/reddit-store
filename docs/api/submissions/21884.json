Mark has a son Nick who\u2019s 8 yo, mom is not present. We have no other family, since we come from a long line of small family trees. Mark and I keep in touch, but we are by no means close. I also have my wonderful husband Jax. \r  \n\r  \nJax and I both make quite good money and could potentially both retire now if we wanted. We are however both passionate about the career projects we are each working on. We have also chosen to be child free, and he had the snip some years ago. We have quite a nice house in a place we love that we share with our four dogs. \r  \n\r  \nMark has over the years had different issues with money, drug issues and running with the wrong crowd. I\u2019ve paid off some of his debt (around 60K $) over the years to keep him afloat, plus arranged for help with drug issues. We live in different ends of the country however, and I have no real relationship with him nor his son. As far as I\u2019m aware he has little to no real support system, but since he\u2019s highly destructive, I\u2019ve chosen to keep my distance. \r  \n\r  \nHowever, Mark recently reached out to let me know he\u2019s going to prison for 7+ years and he would be sending nephew out to stay with me. I\u2019ve heard nothing about this and was completely taken aback (I haven\u2019t heard from Mark in over a year). I let him know that he could do no such thing and I couldn\u2019t just take nephew in for years on end. However nephew is set to go into foster care if Mark can\u2019t find someone to take him. \r  \n\r  \nI understand his horrible predicament, but Jax and I have no desire to bring a child into our care, and we feel royally unfit to care for this child. Mark remarked we both have more than enough time, money and space to care for a child and gave me great grief for saying no. I offered full financial aid for nephew\u2019s expenses if Mark could find someone else trusted to take him in, but he said there\u2019s no one else willing in his life. I felt my offer was more than fair, and my heart breaks for their situation, especially my nephew, but I simply cannot provide him a good life, a place where he isn\u2019t wholeheartedly desired. These are exactly the same reasons husband and I are child free, and why I declined being nephews godmother beck when he was born.\r  \n\r  \nMark\u2019s lawyer has however contacted us, along with Mark continuously pressuring us to take him in. Apparently, nephew is also neurodivergent and quite a handful, and Marks lawyer suspects he won\u2019t have success in foster placements. The things said about me are however very harsh and hurtful and I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m actually directly in the wrong here?\r", "created_utc": 1689018903, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14w4dod/aita_for_not_taking_in_my_nephew_while_my_brother/", "score": 1418, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel for you and your nephew, and hope a resolution is reached.", "NTA\n\nThat's an outrageous demand on your brother's part, not to mention the lawyer.

If OP is willing to throw money at the problem, could they pay the boarding schools fees? And then camps for the vacations? They might have to have the child in their house a few weeks a year in between sessions of school and camp, but that\u2019s a far cry from having the child daily for the next several years. And they could hire a temporary nanny for those times. \n\nIt\u2019s just a thought. It might not be the ideal situation but it should be better than foster care.", "NTA. \n\nPeople who do not want to have a child (however it gets there) should not have a child.", "NTA This is a horrible situation for everyone. I feel really bad for the child. Hopefully the foster family is good. If not I'd probably make sure the kid doesn't have your address.", "NTA - a child needs someone who is willing and able to give them the time and care that they need. If you and your husband don't feel you fit the requirements then you're doing the right thing. It would be pretty sucky for the kid to feel like they've just been dumped with someone who isn't properly equipped to provide the emotional support. Yes Foster care is a bit of a dice roll, but there are plenty of good people out there who have the means to cover ALL of a child;s needs, not just the financial ones, and it is to be hoped that your nephew will find their way into one of these homrs", "NTA. It is a heartbreaking situation, particularly for the boy. But the fact is that your brother made a series if very bad decisions that brought his son to this point. He has no business telling you that you are wrong not taking his kid in. As for others that are judging you, I would ask why they are not stepping up and offering to take in the kid. Your offer to bankroll the kids expenses is very generous and more than covers any obligations you may have.", "NTA\n\nThis is a pretty awful situation and honestly I've heard horror stories about kids getting put in to the system.\n\nWith that being said, they aren't your responsibility and you aren't the one to create this situation either.", "NTA. The fact you have $$ is irrelevant; you don't \\*want\\* to take in your nephew. You're being more than generous to offer to pay anything for the nephew's care. \n\nStand firm, and don't give in if you don't want the nephew living with you.", "NTA - OP, you have no relationship with this child.  He is ND, which I strongly suspect you know absolutely nothing about handling, a major issue in and of itself.  Your offer to assist financially is generous and frankly more than anyone has a right to expect, let alone demand.\n\nAnd for all the flying monkeys on here saying \"You're a shitty aunt\", \"you have a chance to do something good\", \"pay for a boarding school and then just have him part time and pay for a nanny during that\":  How about just one of you who are so glad to dump this problem on OP (in which you are all just as bad as the kid's father to begin with) DM her with your information so she can give it to the attorney and have you background-checked to take over as this child's guardian for the next 7 years.  Finances are the least of the burden that OP is being harrassed to undertake--put up or hush up if you think it's such a freaking great thing to do.  Given the complete lack of relationship that OP has with this child, you don't get the excuse of \"But she's his aunt and therefore knows him.\"", "NTA", "Nta\nThis won't end well for anybody", "You\u2019re NTA, but F@ck!! This poor baby is about to start a sentence of neglect and abuse and my heart is just breaking for him.

My heart hurts.", "My husband and I willingly took in his  nieces after they were orphaned and it was so much harder than I had anticipated. The teen years nearly broke me. \nIf you have no prior relationship with this child you are all basically strangers to each other.\n\n Foster families can run the gamut from great to horrifying. He has 7 years of being stuck in that system. Maybe you should hire a lawyer specifically for the child to help with placing him in a good home.", "NTA\n\n Can't you just block them?", "This is so hard. You shouldn\u2019t have to take on a child when you really don\u2019t want children, but terrible things happen in group homes (and foster care) and it sounds like this is where this boy is headed. What if, rather than becoming his guardian, you offer a temporary foster situation and, instead of paying for another family to take him, you spent the money on a full-time, trained caregiver for your nephew? Someone really well-versed in caring for neurodivergent kids with his specific issues.  Then you could try the situation out. It might have fewer (or different) challenges than you think and rewards you haven\u2019t considered.  NTA. It\u2019s a huge ask.

It\u2019s so likely that something very traumatic will happen to him in state/foster care, and he\u2019s already been through trauma and is about to go through more. I feel like you should try.", "NAH\n\nYou absolutely do not have to take your nephew in, but please know that your nephew is now screwed for life.", "I can't help but feel ESH\n\nThe brother for fucking up his life so that his son ends up alone. \n\nThe sister, well, it is tougher to explain why. And I have huge sympathy for her situation. But... but.... she is essentially saying 'I know he's my nephew, but he doesn't fit my lifestyle so he can go into care'. It just seems wrong. I've always accepted that sometimes we have to do things we really don't want to do just because they are morally right even if we have no strict obligation to do so. With the greatest respect to the sister, this is just one of those IMHO.   \n\n\nI guess this is a situation where there is no right answer: it just depends on whether you feel you would be able to live your life without guilt if you said 'no'. For me? I don't think I would. But I also don't know that I'd say 'yes'.", "You have me very conflicted.... On the one hand, I get that you chose and took steps to have a CF lifestyle. I can relate as I've also chosen this route. But that being said I also find it hard to just throw away your nephew. Foster care is already tough to be in / navigate and he has issues that are going to make that even harder. \n\n>a place where he isn\u2019t wholeheartedly desired.\n\nMaybe I'm an asshole for my thoughts on this but.... better to be safe and cared for in a place where he might not be wholeheartedly desired, than in a place with strangers that might only see him as dollar signs, that may abuse him, don't take care of his individual needs because they have so many other foster, and that don't wholeheartedly desire him...... I'm not saying that ever foster home is like that but I've definitely heard a lot more horror stories than good stories from the foster care system. \n\nIt seems that financially you are doing well. I wonder if you couldn't possibly afford a nanny so that having him would be easier on you?", "ESH don't say it's breaking your heart when it's obviously not, because if it was truly breaking your heart you would take him in or find someone who was willing too cause you know how awful and scary foster care is for children, you would know most foster care kids get sexually, emotionally and physically abused an that would be more important, so don't say your heart is breaking just own up to the fact that you don't give a shit.", "This is a child in his formative years.  By all accounts he's already been through a lot.  You have resources.  You can decide to help this innocent child, which will be inconvenient as hell, or turn aside knowing he will almost certainly face additional even worse hardship.  You really aren't obligated, but you have the opportunity to do something truly meaningful.  If you want to know my personal opinion, if you don't help this innocent child YTA.  Your actions will change his life one way or another, like it or not.", "NTA\n\nBut that doesn't mean you're not a shitty aunt.", "ESH.

It is not breaking enough for you to adjust you life. You are willing ti spend money as long as it does not require you to do anything.

But you may look back to you friends at next cocktail party. \nThis whole \u201cmy heart is breaking\u201d routine. PS and do not try to pull we are not best choice - foster care system sucks. And the kid would be better with you.", "Can you advertise for a full time live in nanny as you are in the position to pay someone to look after this child?  \n\nIt would probably be better for the child to stay at the same school if possible.\n\nMaybe you could pay towards his keep and one of his classmates parents would take him?  \n\nNTA you are not obliged to take this child.  I hope you find a solution", "You should contact the lawyer and tell him you are willing to fund his group home either now or when he turns 18.", ">we feel royally unfit to care for this child\n\nYou are more fit than most parents to care for this child. I think it's perfectly reasonable for you to feel hesitancy towards becoming pseudo-parents for the time being, especially when you had previously made the choice to be child free. However, you would absolutely be the asshole if you sent this child into foster care because you were too selfish to take him in. The child is innocent in this, and it sounds like there are no other options for him. You're within your rights to say no, of course, but YWBTA if you did. Throwing money at the kid rather than taking him in is a disgusting suggestion, also.", "This is a tough spot to be in and I couldn't call you an AH for not taking him in but I do think it would show that you have compassion and empathy if you decided to.. \n\nUnless you or your husband are abusive, that kid won't be worse off with you than he would be in the many foster homes he will be put into and that's even if you literally did the bare minimum for him which is take him in and pay for his needs.\n\n You are comfortable financially you could send him to boarding school and have a nanny for him when he is in your home and it probably wouldn't affect your life style in a very big way at all.. Even without love and affection from you and your husband he would still be so much better off than in a foster home... He may not feel wanted or loved by y'all but he definitely isn't going to feel wanted or loved when he gets passed around from home to home in the foster care system. And sadly being moved around isn't even close to the worst thing that happens to kids in that system.. There is food insecurity, there is physical abuse, mental abuse, sexual abuse, and so much more and I'm not saying that all the homes are like that but a lot are and it's not always the foster parents, sometimes it's the other kids that are also placed in the home. \n\nIf the least you did was make sure he has food, a roof over his head, and an education he will be okay, he doesn't have to get love from you but if you give him stability he can build his own family with the friends he makes but it'll be much less likely if he doesn't have a home base... I highly doubt your nephew has had a very loving home environment already so I don't think you'll be taking that from him but you could easily be giving him the one thing he cannot get without you and that's stability.\n\nYou're NTA if you don't take him in but you have the ability to change this boys life for the better, I hope you at least consider it.. \n\nAlso stop enabling your brother. Paying $60k of his debts has done nothing but made sure he could continue the life he has been living and he's been dragging your nephew through that mud with him. If he had ended up in prison earlier, when the boy was younger the kid would have had a really good chance of being adopted by a family that actually wanted him and would love him. It's very unlikely he'll find that at his age now..", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

If my siblings gave me that much money in such a short span of time, not only would I bend over backwards to make sure I've earned it, they'd get first dibs on any organs I can give them if they should need them. \n\nHere's my additional point, he didn't even ask, or test the waters. He had the audacity to state he was dropping off the kid with 0 discussion or heads up. He didn't assume, he's demanding. And he has the nerve to not only try to emotionally blackmail you, after not even being responsible for his own son's sake after all your help, but to use your successes and good choices as a punishment of \"you have money, so you absolutely must, because you deserve to pay for everything\" is absolute BS. You could put him in a home for special needs children, and have his care paid for, and this brother of yours is demanding everyone's mental health and lives be, well, destroyed because he can't take personal accountability. And then he bites the hands that feeds when you've been nothing but generous. He sounds like a narcissist tbh. \n\nNTA NTA NTA.

You were very generous in offering to bankroll his upbringing if another place can be found - that was above and beyond!!

Another alternative possibility since money isn\u2019t an issue for you perhaps a live in nanny for the child only if you have any niggling doubts.  You\u2019re in a very tough position.  If you WERE willing to take nephew on - which you aren\u2019t - I would have strongly urged you to adopt the boy yourself and have Mark agree to sever his parental rights.

There is another thing, Nick needs as many familiar people as possible.  If he has cousins, friends, aunts/uncles on his other side.  You mentioned your parents have passed, what about his grandparents on the other side?  His mom isn't present, is she dead? Is she incarcerated?  Or did she just step out because the situation was too much for her?  Taking care of ND kids can be a huge group effort.  Not something two working people can easily do.    \n\n\nIf you take Nick in, you are Jax will have to quit your job and will put 100% of your energy into Nick.  The one who quits their job will also be completely overwhelmed.  If you hire someone you are going to have to pay them well.  Taking care of an ND kid can be very difficult, emotionally frustrating, and unpleasant during the bad times.  This is not a $10 per hour job, this is a $35+ per hour job.

That if something happens, you would like to know about it? For instance, if he\u2019s hospitalized, or is in need of some sort of particular care that you might be able to make sure he receives. At the very least, while this child may go into the foster system, he won\u2019t be forgotten. Perhaps OP can also be sure that he also doesn\u2019t go without as many foster children seem to do.
