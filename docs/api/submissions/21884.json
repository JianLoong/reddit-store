Mark has a son Nick who\u2019s 8 yo, mom is not present. We have no other family, since we come from a long line of small family trees. Mark and I keep in touch, but we are by no means close. I also have my wonderful husband Jax. \r  \n\r  \nJax and I both make quite good money and could potentially both retire now if we wanted. We are however both passionate about the career projects we are each working on. We have also chosen to be child free, and he had the snip some years ago. We have quite a nice house in a place we love that we share with our four dogs. \r  \n\r  \nMark has over the years had different issues with money, drug issues and running with the wrong crowd. I\u2019ve paid off some of his debt (around 60K $) over the years to keep him afloat, plus arranged for help with drug issues. We live in different ends of the country however, and I have no real relationship with him nor his son. As far as I\u2019m aware he has little to no real support system, but since he\u2019s highly destructive, I\u2019ve chosen to keep my distance. \r  \n\r  \nHowever, Mark recently reached out to let me know he\u2019s going to prison for 7+ years and he would be sending nephew out to stay with me. I\u2019ve heard nothing about this and was completely taken aback (I haven\u2019t heard from Mark in over a year). I let him know that he could do no such thing and I couldn\u2019t just take nephew in for years on end. However nephew is set to go into foster care if Mark can\u2019t find someone to take him. \r  \n\r  \nI understand his horrible predicament, but Jax and I have no desire to bring a child into our care, and we feel royally unfit to care for this child. Mark remarked we both have more than enough time, money and space to care for a child and gave me great grief for saying no. I offered full financial aid for nephew\u2019s expenses if Mark could find someone else trusted to take him in, but he said there\u2019s no one else willing in his life. I felt my offer was more than fair, and my heart breaks for their situation, especially my nephew, but I simply cannot provide him a good life, a place where he isn\u2019t wholeheartedly desired. These are exactly the same reasons husband and I are child free, and why I declined being nephews godmother beck when he was born.\r  \n\r  \nMark\u2019s lawyer has however contacted us, along with Mark continuously pressuring us to take him in. Apparently, nephew is also neurodivergent and quite a handful, and Marks lawyer suspects he won\u2019t have success in foster placements. The things said about me are however very harsh and hurtful and I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m actually directly in the wrong here?\r", "created_utc": 1689018903, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14w4dod/aita_for_not_taking_in_my_nephew_while_my_brother/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Although your nephew is in a horrible spot here, it doesn\u2019t make you responsible for all the bridges your brother has burned, or the countless poor decisions made that got them here. I feel for you and your nephew, and hope a resolution is reached.", "NTA\n\nThat's an outrageous demand on your brother's part, not to mention the lawyer.  Even if the kid wasn't likely to be an unmanageable disaster, why in the world would you want to put up with it?!  \n\nNot your problem, to put it mildly.", "NTA\n\nThere are two adults in OP\u2019s household who need to agree on caring for this child.\n\nOne thought\u2014are there boarding schools for children this young? If OP is willing to throw money at the problem, could they pay the boarding schools fees? And then camps for the vacations? They might have to have the child in their house a few weeks a year in between sessions of school and camp, but that\u2019s a far cry from having the child daily for the next several years. And they could hire a temporary nanny for those times. \n\nIt\u2019s just a thought. It might not be the ideal situation but it should be better than foster care.", "NTA. \n\nPeople who do not want to have a child (however it gets there) should not have a child.", "NTA This is a horrible situation for everyone. I feel really bad for the child. Hopefully the foster family is good. If not I'd probably make sure the kid doesn't have your address.", "NTA - a child needs someone who is willing and able to give them the time and care that they need. If you and your husband don't feel you fit the requirements then you're doing the right thing. It would be pretty sucky for the kid to feel like they've just been dumped with someone who isn't properly equipped to provide the emotional support. Yes Foster care is a bit of a dice roll, but there are plenty of good people out there who have the means to cover ALL of a child;s needs, not just the financial ones, and it is to be hoped that your nephew will find their way into one of these homrs", "NTA. It is a heartbreaking situation, particularly for the boy. But the fact is that your brother made a series if very bad decisions that brought his son to this point. He has no business telling you that you are wrong not taking his kid in. As for others that are judging you, I would ask why they are not stepping up and offering to take in the kid. Your offer to bankroll the kids expenses is very generous and more than covers any obligations you may have.", "NTA\n\nThis is a pretty awful situation and honestly I've heard horror stories about kids getting put in to the system.\n\nWith that being said, they aren't your responsibility and you aren't the one to create this situation either.", "NTA. The fact you have $$ is irrelevant; you don't \\*want\\* to take in your nephew. You're being more than generous to offer to pay anything for the nephew's care. \n\nStand firm, and don't give in if you don't want the nephew living with you.", "NTA - OP, you have no relationship with this child.  He is ND, which I strongly suspect you know absolutely nothing about handling, a major issue in and of itself.  Your offer to assist financially is generous and frankly more than anyone has a right to expect, let alone demand.\n\nAnd for all the flying monkeys on here saying \"You're a shitty aunt\", \"you have a chance to do something good\", \"pay for a boarding school and then just have him part time and pay for a nanny during that\":  How about just one of you who are so glad to dump this problem on OP (in which you are all just as bad as the kid's father to begin with) DM her with your information so she can give it to the attorney and have you background-checked to take over as this child's guardian for the next 7 years.  Finances are the least of the burden that OP is being harrassed to undertake--put up or hush up if you think it's such a freaking great thing to do.  Given the complete lack of relationship that OP has with this child, you don't get the excuse of \"But she's his aunt and therefore knows him.\"", "NTA", "Nta\nThis won't end well for anybody", "You\u2019re NTA, but F@ck!! This poor baby is about to start a sentence of neglect and abuse and my heart is just breaking for him. The odds he\u2019ll be treated even remotely well at 8 with neurodivergence, it\u2019s nearly 0. My heart hurts.", "My husband and I willingly took in his  nieces after they were orphaned and it was so much harder than I had anticipated. The teen years nearly broke me. \nIf you have no prior relationship with this child you are all basically strangers to each other.\n\n Foster families can run the gamut from great to horrifying. He has 7 years of being stuck in that system. Maybe you should hire a lawyer specifically for the child to help with placing him in a good home.", "NTA\n\n Can't you just block them?", "This is so hard. You shouldn\u2019t have to take on a child when you really don\u2019t want children, but terrible things happen in group homes (and foster care) and it sounds like this is where this boy is headed. What if, rather than becoming his guardian, you offer a temporary foster situation and, instead of paying for another family to take him, you spent the money on a full-time, trained caregiver for your nephew? Someone really well-versed in caring for neurodivergent kids with his specific issues.  Then you could try the situation out. It might have fewer (or different) challenges than you think and rewards you haven\u2019t considered.  NTA. It\u2019s a huge ask. But it\u2019s truly all but the little boy\u2019s actual life at stake. It\u2019s so likely that something very traumatic will happen to him in state/foster care, and he\u2019s already been through trauma and is about to go through more. I feel like you should try.", "NAH\n\nYou absolutely do not have to take your nephew in, but please know that your nephew is now screwed for life.", "I can't help but feel ESH\n\nThe brother for fucking up his life so that his son ends up alone. \n\nThe sister, well, it is tougher to explain why. And I have huge sympathy for her situation. But... but.... she is essentially saying 'I know he's my nephew, but he doesn't fit my lifestyle so he can go into care'. It just seems wrong. I've always accepted that sometimes we have to do things we really don't want to do just because they are morally right even if we have no strict obligation to do so. With the greatest respect to the sister, this is just one of those IMHO.   \n\n\nI guess this is a situation where there is no right answer: it just depends on whether you feel you would be able to live your life without guilt if you said 'no'. For me? I don't think I would. But I also don't know that I'd say 'yes'.", "You have me very conflicted.... On the one hand, I get that you chose and took steps to have a CF lifestyle. I can relate as I've also chosen this route. But that being said I also find it hard to just throw away your nephew. Foster care is already tough to be in / navigate and he has issues that are going to make that even harder. \n\n>a place where he isn\u2019t wholeheartedly desired.\n\nMaybe I'm an asshole for my thoughts on this but.... better to be safe and cared for in a place where he might not be wholeheartedly desired, than in a place with strangers that might only see him as dollar signs, that may abuse him, don't take care of his individual needs because they have so many other foster, and that don't wholeheartedly desire him...... I'm not saying that ever foster home is like that but I've definitely heard a lot more horror stories than good stories from the foster care system. \n\nIt seems that financially you are doing well. I wonder if you couldn't possibly afford a nanny so that having him would be easier on you?", "ESH don't say it's breaking your heart when it's obviously not, because if it was truly breaking your heart you would take him in or find someone who was willing too cause you know how awful and scary foster care is for children, you would know most foster care kids get sexually, emotionally and physically abused an that would be more important, so don't say your heart is breaking just own up to the fact that you don't give a shit.", "This is a child in his formative years.  By all accounts he's already been through a lot.  You have resources.  You can decide to help this innocent child, which will be inconvenient as hell, or turn aside knowing he will almost certainly face additional even worse hardship.  You really aren't obligated, but you have the opportunity to do something truly meaningful.  If you want to know my personal opinion, if you don't help this innocent child YTA.  Your actions will change his life one way or another, like it or not.", "NTA\n\nBut that doesn't mean you're not a shitty aunt.", "ESH.

It is not breaking enough for you to adjust you life. You are willing ti spend money as long as it does not require you to do anything. Just be honest and say that you do not care for some random kid and your picture perfect life is more important than him. That is completely in your right. But you may look back to you friends at next cocktail party. \nThis whole \u201cmy heart is breaking\u201d routine. PS and do not try to pull we are not best choice - foster care system sucks. And the kid would be better with you.", "Can you advertise for a full time live in nanny as you are in the position to pay someone to look after this child?  \n\nIt would probably be better for the child to stay at the same school if possible.\n\nMaybe you could pay towards his keep and one of his classmates parents would take him?  \n\nNTA you are not obliged to take this child.  I hope you find a solution", "You should contact the lawyer and tell him you are willing to fund his group home either now or when he turns 18.", ">we feel royally unfit to care for this child\n\nYou are more fit than most parents to care for this child. I think it's perfectly reasonable for you to feel hesitancy towards becoming pseudo-parents for the time being, especially when you had previously made the choice to be child free. However, you would absolutely be the asshole if you sent this child into foster care because you were too selfish to take him in. The child is innocent in this, and it sounds like there are no other options for him. You're within your rights to say no, of course, but YWBTA if you did. Throwing money at the kid rather than taking him in is a disgusting suggestion, also.", "This is a tough spot to be in and I couldn't call you an AH for not taking him in but I do think it would show that you have compassion and empathy if you decided to.. \n\nUnless you or your husband are abusive, that kid won't be worse off with you than he would be in the many foster homes he will be put into and that's even if you literally did the bare minimum for him which is take him in and pay for his needs.\n\n You are comfortable financially you could send him to boarding school and have a nanny for him when he is in your home and it probably wouldn't affect your life style in a very big way at all.. Even without love and affection from you and your husband he would still be so much better off than in a foster home... He may not feel wanted or loved by y'all but he definitely isn't going to feel wanted or loved when he gets passed around from home to home in the foster care system. And sadly being moved around isn't even close to the worst thing that happens to kids in that system.. There is food insecurity, there is physical abuse, mental abuse, sexual abuse, and so much more and I'm not saying that all the homes are like that but a lot are and it's not always the foster parents, sometimes it's the other kids that are also placed in the home. \n\nIf the least you did was make sure he has food, a roof over his head, and an education he will be okay, he doesn't have to get love from you but if you give him stability he can build his own family with the friends he makes but it'll be much less likely if he doesn't have a home base... I highly doubt your nephew has had a very loving home environment already so I don't think you'll be taking that from him but you could easily be giving him the one thing he cannot get without you and that's stability.\n\nYou're NTA if you don't take him in but you have the ability to change this boys life for the better, I hope you at least consider it.. \n\nAlso stop enabling your brother. Paying $60k of his debts has done nothing but made sure he could continue the life he has been living and he's been dragging your nephew through that mud with him. If he had ended up in prison earlier, when the boy was younger the kid would have had a really good chance of being adopted by a family that actually wanted him and would love him. It's very unlikely he'll find that at his age now..", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

No one has his address.", "I'm not blaming OP for her choice but I pointing out that her logic is flawed. She states she couldn't give him a good home because he isn't wholeheartedly desired at hers, but in all reality he's not going to be wholeheartedly desired anywhere and more likely to be abused in the foster care system To say that she just doesn't want to deal with this kid if that's how she feels is fine, but she's trying to frame it as that's what would be best for him when in fact more likely than not it is not what's best.", "My guess is if Mark is going to jail and you've had to loan him 60k before that he probably doesn't have much money. That being said his lawyer isn't going to look into any alternatives for foster care because there are none if you don't have any money. You said that you would provide financially if something else can be setup. Look into boarding schools and see if they are something you can / are willing to afford.", "I think you might have sympathy, not empathy.  If you put yourself in this child's place there's no way you would send him to foster care.", "Whose fault it is will definitely matter to the suffering child for sure.", "This", "No you should not. Just do not go around saying how much you feel for the kid.", "It\u2019s not about the brother. It\u2019s about the boy. There are people who believe that adults should protect children if they can. This aunt can protect her nephew from a situation that is basically guaranteed to be bad (no one has good stories about growing up in a group home) and very likely to be terrible. It is LIKELY that this child will be abused and/or molested. It is 28x more likely that it will happen if she doesn\u2019t take him\u2014it will be a miracle if anyone fosters this kid, and that\u2019s a dangerous situation, too. He is eight. He is her nephew. She can afford it. It is not unreasonable to wonder how there could be a question, here.", "I took in my 2 neices and 1 nephew; all under 5. \nI honestly just read this post and felt like on one hand yah; she shouldnt be forced to take the child, but on the other - and maybe this is my bleeding heart, I couldnt let my family (especially kids) go to a shelter or foster care, when I have the means to care for them.", "NTA. But he is the one responsable for his life and his kid. op didn't want kids and there is nothing worst to be stuck with kids when you don't want them and worse if they are not yours. She is entitled to feel bad and guilty but she has made her life choices and her brother too so one must be responsible and face the consequences. I believe that foster care will be better for him and your brother can understand that he cannot screw up anymore and trust that OP will magically make everything better. Actions have consequences.", "Sorry, I disagree with everything you're saying. I think sending a child into foster care and throwing money at him as consolation is an asshole move. It's a move OP can take, because it is her life, but this sub is about if she would be an asshole or not, and I think she is. What if Mark had died and left OP as legal guardian in his will?", "If I were in OP's situation, I would in a heartbeat. And I say that as someone who has also chosen to be child free, btw.", "Absolutely, but the fact that the nephew's dad is to blame doesn't change that the nephew is now screwed for life.", "Thank you, so do i", "Yep, giving a kidney is damned inconvenient.", "maybe you should update your post with better reasons for not taking him in then the once you put in there now.....", "I have adopted kids, and you?", "Maybe because they constantly travel and would be absent parents", "I know it\u2019s not the greatest for the kid but probs better than foster care", "Shit I feel bad for the kid but it doesn\u2019t mean me as a single dude with two cats but a bigger house should be responsible", "So basically change her entire life for something she never asked for. You\u2019re an asshole.", "I don't think you can leave someone as guardian without their approval. \n\nWell then, you can take him in. You have the same relationship with the kid op has, which is none. \n\n Op has the right to make choices that make her happy. Not her fault that her brother is a loser.  So why should she ruin her whole life??", "So I'm assuming by your objection to OP's decision that YOU have at least one neurodivergent foster kid under your care?", "Oh sure you would. Just admit you\u2019re being hypocritical", "That is you, and that is fine. But I don't feel that gives you the right to judge the OP. Because really, when you think about it, what is the claim the kid has on OP beyond blood? She does not know the kid, maybe has never even met him. There is no emotional connection.\n\nTrue for some people, like yourself the fact that someone is a blood relative provides a sense of emotional attachment and obligation. But for many of us blood connections are simply an accident of birth and have no real value. The only exception I would make for this is when ones chooses to have children of their own--then there is an absolute, ironclad obligation of support. Beyond that, family obligations based on blood are an archaic concept. The family we make, that is where our real obligations lie.", "You are in OP situation.  You have as much of a relationship with that kid as she does.  Reddit posters always remind us that blood does not make family.  You can personal message OP to get the contact information and volunteer your services.  Make sure to keep us updated on the young man\u2019s progress.", "Shit a 3 month vs 7 year commitment", "I am childfree", "Do you think people\u2019s lives don\u2019t constantly change because of circumstances they never asked for? What on earth are you talking about?", ">Op has the right to make choices that make her happy\n\nI wholeheartedly agree. But this sub isn't \"do I have the right to do this\" it's \"am I the asshole for doing this.\" I stand by my judgment. Agree to disagree.", "I would. You don't have to believe me lmao. But I would, and that's why my answer stands as it is.", "I mean, the purpose of posting in this sub is asking people to judge, so that's what I'm doing haha. We can agree to disagree!", "A child's literal life.", "So even though she\u2019s in control of this YOU want her to follow what your morals are. She is not an asshole for this situation. The foster system being an issue is a different story", "You adopt the kid then", "You\u2019re just talking out both sides to feel better then because you know it\u2019ll never happen", "Good point.", "I\u2019m childfree for a reason like OP. I have myself snipped to NEVER have kids", "Whatever you say, dude. You can rest on your morals and I will mine.", "FANTASTIC. That was a truly great decision. Standing ovation.", "Relevance?", "Beauty of this subreddit", "OP is ardently childfree. Apparently people like you don\u2019t wanna accept that", "What do you mean don't want to accept it?  It's right there in black and white, I understand the situation.  It's her choice to make.  That doesn't mean her choices won't have the most dire of consequences for an innocent child.  Reality is reality, and I do accept reality."]}
