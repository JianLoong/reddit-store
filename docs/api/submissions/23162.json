Nobody is,  here.", "NTA \n\nI thought your mother was upset that the auntie told her some stuff that wasn\u2019t age appropriate but her being upset at you not delivering this talk is ridiculous. It\u2019s important for your daughter to have a female role model and someone she can trust that is a girl in her life and that\u2019s what auntie is doing and that\u2019s awesome.

Also I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\n\nEdit: after reading your comments I\u2019d like to add it is super important as your daughter gets older that you do make an effort to learn and educate yourself on the female body/puberty so that you can be there to support her and guide her during that part of her life as well. There\u2019s nothing wrong with Auntie being there but you can\u2019t rely on her to do it!", " NTA. You don\u2019t have to know how to do every little thing, especially girl talk, to be a good parent.

You\u2019re right to be thankful for her aunt being a trusted adult that can talk to her.", "I won\u2019t make a judgment BUT. You need to educate yourself, and have another talk with her in a few years. The whole shebang.

Your excuses come across as rather stupid and immature and that you dont want to have to deal with any of the \"ickiness\" of girls puberty so you abdicate that responsibility to your gfs sister. \n\nI have 4 girls and both myself and husband gave our oldest the talk. He read up on everything and he told her that while he might not know absolutely everything she could always come and talk to him about her periods etc, that they were natural and not embarassing in the slightest to him. The same will be done with the others. And you know what he was the first person she told when she got her period.\n \nYou need to let your daughter know that she can also come to you for advice and her needs. That you are also a safe place for her to talk to about her feelings, emotions and all that go with puberty and beyond. I get being a single parent is tough and its good that she does have a maternal influence but YOU are her parent and you need to be there for her as well.\n\nAlso just to clarify after rereading your post - did you actually give the go ahead for this talk to happen or did the aunt just take it upon herself to do it and she told yoi after the fact?", "YTA\n\nFirstly, I am sorry about your girlfriend passing away.\n\nHowever, \n\n> I have not the slightest clue on how to have that kind of talk with her.\n\nIf only there was a place where you could look things up!\n\n> I don\u2019t even think I could with someone my own age.\n\n/rolling eyes\n\nIt's about sex and the human body.  It's natural.  It's normal. \n\n> It just gets hard sometimes\n\nYes, it does get hard sometimes, you are absolutely right.  I get it, I'm single parent also.  However, it is your responsibility to deal with this.  Will your daughter feel too squeamish to talk to you when she runs of of tampons or pads.  Whom will she turn to when a boy is pressuring her to do something she may not be ready for?  She needs to be able to turn to you on a moment's notice.  She needs to know that no matter what, she can talk to you about it and you'll answer her questions and reassure her.  She needs to be able to call you and say \"dad, I'm at a party and ...\"  She needs to make sure that the things happening to her body as treated as absolutely normal not that dad can't handle talking about sex and the body - maybe I'm doing something wrong.  Are you going to hold her box of tampons away from your body with two fingers while looking away?  Get it together dad, it's all natural.  You're old enough.  That little girl is going to become a young lady and a woman - equip her with all the things she needs to know.", "YTA - youre daughter is 8, you\u2019re 28yrs old and you\u2019re using the excuse of \u201cI have no idea how periods work\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s tough to find time to read about it\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s great that your daughter has someone to talk to but you\u2019re not even putting in *minimal* effort here.

While ideally, yes, being able to have an open and honest conversation about the facts of life with your own child is a good thing, there's 2 possible issues that come to mind for your situation specifically. The two issues may even be related and consolidated as a single issue.\n\n1) Your level of comfort with the topic. Not everybody can just KNOW what to say or how to say it when it comes to growing up, and for people like that having someone close to you who can help you out or step in is nothing to be ashamed about. We all have weaknesses or limitations somewhere in life and being able to turn to someone we trust to help out is a much better solution than just ignoring the issue.\n\n2) You are a guy. Now, I don't know how good your sex education is, for all I know it could be completely fine, but I've seen way too much online to know that sex ed has failed a LOT of people and men in particular are sometimes pretty bad at knowing how women's bodies work. Again, not saying that this is you, but while your actual knowledge may be fine, there may also be the stigma of \"well he's a man so what can he really know.\" Having a female friend who can help address these things with your daughter not only ensures that your kid's information comes from a source of \"Yeah I went through this myself,\" but also helps her develop a bond and respect with an older woman in her life that she trusts, and if your kid ever feels too shy to come to YOU with something, she'll know that she does have a female authority she can lean on as well.", "NTA.", "NTA. WTF is wrong with your mom? That's way overboard for what happened. Is she always this toxic?\n\nOn another note. Start studying up now. There's other things that are coming up in the coming years you may have to handle. Things like period products and birth control. It's going to be uncomfortable, but you can do this. You've got time to figure it out.", "NTA, your Mom is wrong. Being a single parent is tough and you are a single parent in the truest sense of the term. It's great your daughter has an aunt she can discuss \"girl stuff\" with and great you have someone to take your daughter for a bit so you can have some \"me time\".\n\nYou're doing great.

That person doesn\u2019t always have to be the parent. My daughter often talks to my sister about things, sometimes she talks to me about the same things, then she talks to my mum. We are all female btw. It\u2019s good to have different people for her to go to and different perspectives and safe people she is comfortable with.", "NTA. I see you've been reading about things so you can be a source of information for her, and that's great! I suggest also talking to your SIL and pick your favorite social media (Reddit?) to ask others what you should know as well. Mom for a Minute seems like a nice place.", "NTA This wasn't a \"here are the facts about your body\" talk that you absolutely should be able to do. It was a emotions and boys almost a tween talk that is pretty specific to being a girl on thr brink of puberty. Absolutely nothing wrong with leaving those up to her aunt. It's important for her to have a female role model of that age who she trusts and who ypu trust.", "NTA. It's good to have a safe female available to her.

Get this or a book like this and read it yourself. It will be educational for you. It will also give you a solid base of knowledge to work from and then you can slowly work on gathering more knowledge. You don\u2019t have to have a super in depth knowledge, but a solid understanding. I\u2019d also bet there are women in your life that would be willing to teach you and help you. Hell, I don\u2019t know you and I\u2019d be willing to help you. You and your daughter are very lucky to have her auntie to help, but there will come a time where she won\u2019t be available and it\u2019ll all be on you.", "Well, not TA for asking for help.\n\nBut you are wrong here. This is not one time talk, this topic you will come back over and over and kid should come to you with questions and should know you are knowledgeable and available.\n\nSo educate yourself.
