There\u2019s nothing wrong with Auntie being there but you can\u2019t rely on her to do it!", " NTA.

Your excuses come across as rather stupid and immature and that you dont want to have to deal with any of the \"ickiness\" of girls puberty so you abdicate that responsibility to your gfs sister. \n\nI have 4 girls and both myself and husband gave our oldest the talk. He read up on everything and he told her that while he might not know absolutely everything she could always come and talk to him about her periods etc, that they were natural and not embarassing in the slightest to him. The same will be done with the others. And you know what he was the first person she told when she got her period.\n \nYou need to let your daughter know that she can also come to you for advice and her needs. That you are also a safe place for her to talk to about her feelings, emotions and all that go with puberty and beyond. I get being a single parent is tough and its good that she does have a maternal influence but YOU are her parent and you need to be there for her as well.\n\nAlso just to clarify after rereading your post - did you actually give the go ahead for this talk to happen or did the aunt just take it upon herself to do it and she told yoi after the fact?", "YTA\n\nFirstly, I am sorry about your girlfriend passing away.\n\nHowever, \n\n> I have not the slightest clue on how to have that kind of talk with her.\n\nIf only there was a place where you could look things up!\n\n> I don\u2019t even think I could with someone my own age.\n\n/rolling eyes\n\nIt's about sex and the human body.  It's natural.  It's normal. \n\n> It just gets hard sometimes\n\nYes, it does get hard sometimes, you are absolutely right.  I get it, I'm single parent also.  However, it is your responsibility to deal with this.  Will your daughter feel too squeamish to talk to you when she runs of of tampons or pads.  Whom will she turn to when a boy is pressuring her to do something she may not be ready for?  She needs to be able to turn to you on a moment's notice.  She needs to know that no matter what, she can talk to you about it and you'll answer her questions and reassure her.  She needs to be able to call you and say \"dad, I'm at a party and ...\"  She needs to make sure that the things happening to her body as treated as absolutely normal not that dad can't handle talking about sex and the body - maybe I'm doing something wrong.  Are you going to hold her box of tampons away from your body with two fingers while looking away?  Get it together dad, it's all natural.  You're old enough.

While ideally, yes, being able to have an open and honest conversation about the facts of life with your own child is a good thing, there's 2 possible issues that come to mind for your situation specifically. The two issues may even be related and consolidated as a single issue.\n\n1) Your level of comfort with the topic. Not everybody can just KNOW what to say or how to say it when it comes to growing up, and for people like that having someone close to you who can help you out or step in is nothing to be ashamed about. We all have weaknesses or limitations somewhere in life and being able to turn to someone we trust to help out is a much better solution than just ignoring the issue.\n\n2) You are a guy. Now, I don't know how good your sex education is, for all I know it could be completely fine, but I've seen way too much online to know that sex ed has failed a LOT of people and men in particular are sometimes pretty bad at knowing how women's bodies work. Again, not saying that this is you, but while your actual knowledge may be fine, there may also be the stigma of \"well he's a man so what can he really know.\" Having a female friend who can help address these things with your daughter not only ensures that your kid's information comes from a source of \"Yeah I went through this myself,\" but also helps her develop a bond and respect with an older woman in her life that she trusts, and if your kid ever feels too shy to come to YOU with something, she'll know that she does have a female authority she can lean on as well.", "NTA.", "NTA. WTF is wrong with your mom? That's way overboard for what happened. Is she always this toxic?\n\nOn another note. Start studying up now.

There's nothing wrong with not knowing everything, and it might be good for you to sometimes say \"I dont know the best answer for that, why don't we sit down and do some learning together.\" The most important thing is to make sure she doesn't feel embarassed or ashamed about her body or what's happening.\n\nJust remember girls start puberty around 8, so you should be prepared.   \n - Get your bathroom stocked with pads. Her period probably won't start for years now (12 is average) but it could be tomorrow, so be prepared so she doesnt feel embarassed. And once it starts, keep an eye on the supply, so when she's still young you can restock for her without her needing to ask.\n\n- Buying your first bra is kind of a big deal to a lot of girls so don't treat it like just any other shopping trip, and tell her her aunt can bring her instead if she's more comfortable.\n\n- Girls don't typically get BO as bad as boys do during puberty, but they still need to learn proper hygeine, so you can wait for 6th grade health class, but talking about things like shaving and deodorant at home will give her an opportunity to ask questions without peer pressure. Just make sure you don't come at it from a \"I've noticed you smell like sweat\" angle.", "It's definitely worth reading up so you're ready if advice/help is needed in future, and also so you have some idea of what she'll be going through. If you let yourself be scared about it all, you may unwittingly communicate that to her, and make her anxious about her body in turn. Try to ensure you're always a safe place for her to go to, without getting yourself tied up in knots about whether you can answer every question off the top of your head - as any teacher will tell you, the key is not knowing all the answers, but knowing how to find out the answers you don't know.\n\nBut you're NTA in this situation - it's great that your daughter has such a good relationship with her aunt, and it's clear how much you love her.", "At least have a book about human biology in the bookshelf.", "This comment is kinda dumb, the female body and puberty isn't rocket science, you're telling me you can't spend one evening after she's gone to bed finding out about the things your daughter will experience for the vast majority of life? Also you made a baby, so clearly you know how that part works already \ud83d\ude44 deffo NTA for having auntie be an important and trusted figure in daughters life but you absolutely need to make more of an effort to clue yourself up about all of this for the future so you can also be a trusted person in your daughters life", "In over 8 years you couldn't have spared 10 minutes at a time here and there to do at least some surface level research? Come on man. You work 9-5, great, so do most adults, and they can still find the time to read up on the basics of female anatomy when they have a daughter, even as a single parent. Reading up on that is not a full time job, you're not required to do a PhD to understand it. It takes maybe an hour and then you know how to handle it when she does inevitably get her first period.", "There are age appropriate books her age that you can both read together- but dude your the dad. You have to step up and especially with this topic unless you want to be grandpa when she is in high school. Also May I suggest you get some grief counseling- the way you describe your child\u2019s mother makes me feel you haven\u2019t truly gotten over her loss"]}
