{"id": 33190, "submission_id": "18k8jxa", "title": "AITA for telling my sister she is miserable and is trying to ruin my relationship?", "selftext": "So I have been dating this guy for a 2 years now. Honestly it\u2019s been great. He is smart, funny, attentive and all around great to be around. The issue is that he has no close friendships with anyone. He has had friends before but it seems he has dropped them all for various reasons. The only person he considers a good friend is serving 20 years in prison. He has photos of him in places like camping, Vegas, partying, etc with many people. And when I asked about them he says things like \u201cfuck that guy, he\u2019s a bitch/pussy.\u201d Or \u201cidk I don\u2019t fuck with them anymore they are a loser\u201d. He\u2019s said that about 5-6 different people. \n\nHe also comes from a large family, he has 2 brothers and many cousins. He speaks very very negatively about his brothers and his cousins. He seemingly hates them. But from what I can tell he was close to them all the way into his 20\u2019s. He is pretty close to his parents. He goes over to his parents house every Sunday and spends time with them and watches football with his dad, they both get very drunk and then smoke weed together which I don\u2019t like but it\u2019s whatever. His dad also seemingly doesn\u2019t like his other sons nor his extended family. His mom gets along with everyone. She\u2019s the reason why I know all of this. She tells me everything. She\u2019s a beautiful soul. She loves him very much and I know he loves her. But he says some very nasty things about her at times.\n just wonder if any of this means anything.. he\u2019s great to me. He treats me like a queen. Better than any boyfriend I\u2019ve ever had. I should also mention he doesn\u2019t work as he lives off a pretty large inheritance. He mainly does boxing/mma training 5 days a weeks and then streams himself playing video games. He says that\u2019s what he wants to do for a living. Idk. \n\nSo my sister has been telling me for months that my boyfriend is no good and a red flag and all this other stuff. She even makes passive aggressive comments to him about being a loner. It\u2019s been upsetting me so much. I ended telling my sister she\u2019s just miserable because she is in her mid 30\u2019s and single and that no one wants her and that she will likely die alone. \n\nWas I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1702785313, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18k8jxa/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_is_miserable_and/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister is right about the red flags.  Someday it will be your turn to get treated like he treats his former friends", "YTA- did you read any of what you wrote? That man sounds miserable and a walking red flag. What is his plan when/if the inheritance runs out? Also like others have pointed out, he\u2019s most likely said some shit about you or will once you have a bad argument. \n\nAlso you sound mean AF based on your response to your sister. Who says that? You sound like one of those desperate and delusional people who responds with \u201cyou\u2019re just jealous!!\u201d anytime someone has some type of criticism or concern. You owe her an apology and maybe take a look in the mirror bc god knows you need it. Do better", "Yikes. You're in a sea of marinara right there. Please take off the rose colour glasses. Please take a minute or two and ask yourself if you're really truly happy in this relationship. I think you could do a lot better and your sister thinks so too. Please work on your self esteem because you're settling for less here. YTA but you can't see it yet. Sis is doing you a favour, apologize to her and re-read what you wrote here.", "Yta. If you are happy in this kind of relationship, it\u2019s up to you. Your sister is right. He has not real job and is a loner/bum. Also, he talks bad about everyone around him. So he\u2019s probably talking bad or complaining about you behind your back.", "I agree with your sister about the red flags. But, if you think her honesty is a problem, tell her you don't want to hear anymore. YTA for thinking that she is the miserable one here, though.", "Yta - you are never the special person that is better than past people; if this guy has nothing good to say about people like he does, he has issues. \n\nTrust me, it's only going to take one bad argument and you will be in the same camp as the people he shit talks", "YTA\n\nListen to sis: BF has zero work ethic, frequently trashes people close to him, his idea of fun is getting drunk on his parent's couch with dad, etc.\n\nRed flags flying.

Your sister is right about the red flags, literally everything you said about your boyfriend in this post, is a gigantic red flag.", "YTA and a huge one. Your precious BF sounds miserable af and she was worried about you. The way you responded was immature and unnecessarily cruel.", "Yes you were, and quite honestly your sister is reading the situation correctly.  What\u2019s not to say your boyfriend is throwing you under the bus behind your back?\n\nYTA", "YTA - You should trust that your sister is giving you real feedback because she cares.   It's often the community (family, friends, etc) around us who can spot the red flags when we're too blinded by our feelings for another person.", "Better to die alone than settle for a walking red flag like your bf.", "You sound like you deserve him. YTA", "She\u2019s trying to save you but she needs to stop and let you get screwed over. YTA because she didn\u2019t insult you, she warned you.

Lol", "I agree with this. It wouldn't be too bad if he was truly a loner, but he badmouths everyone he doesn't have a relationship with anymore. Also, the fact that the mother is telling OP these things is very significative.\nOP is stuck in the \"treats me as a queen\" aspect and not everything else, like he is a lousy son to his mother and no real plans for the future, etc."]}
