Quite honestly, great job! You only feel bad because you love your dad and don't enjoy seeing him in this predicament, but guess what? You're his daughter. He's doing right by you. And those calling you ungrateful - pfft. Exactly what do you have to show gratitude for? A cold woman who never hid her dislike for you? No. I don't believe for one minute that being disabled means putting up with unkind caregivers. That is not something to be grateful for.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.

Also why hadn\u2019t you already told your dad those things? He should be aware when she\u2019s treating you badly so he can put a stop to it", "Oh hon. You did not cause that fight any more than an iPhone blows up a gas station. That fight was there waiting under a thinner and thinner veil. I would talk to your dad about how you feel.

I could tell you all about stepmoms.\n\nMine has driven my dad\u2019s health into a downward spiral. She\u2019s always been jealous of my dad\u2019s relationship with me and my sister and has always tried to come between that. It has gotten so bad that she has even alienated us from our dad, so he barely sees us anymore, and I hate even being around her because she always uses every conversation we have with her to \u201cone-up\u201d us to where she\u2019s trying to compete as to who has had it worse.\n\nWhen I was 12 and my sister was 6, our stepmom convinced our dad to drop us off on our doorstep on Christmas Day and they promised they would come right back to pick us up. They never came back, and I spent the next five+ years refusing to ever see my dad again because of this. That was my last straw.\n\nYou aren\u2019t ungrateful, and you know how she is. She\u2019s pretending to be stepmom of the year in front of other people, but you see right through the facade because you constantly have to deal with her mess.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. I hope things get better for you. Everything will be okay in the end.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. It's ok to snap after listening to lies like that. And there is no reason anymore should be allowed to tell you how to feel. Next time someone tells you you are ungrateful you could ask them if  they would just smile and nod if someone told everyone else the complete opposite of how things are really going to make themselves look good. \nYour father seems to have issues with how your stepmom has been treating you. There wouldn't be such a massive argument if he was in agreement with her. It's positive that you are your father's priority.", "NTA. Sucks that it came down to this, but you can bet that if your father had passed before stepmom, you'd probably have to fight tooth and nail for any inheritance or might be thrown out. At least your father knows now and \\*should\\* plan his will accordingly.", "Congrats on standing up for yourself!

I'm not really understanding how your dad could convince someone to marry him if his only objective was to get them to help take care of you. Like if he is rich and the allure to the woman was wealth, then why didn't he just hire an at home caregiver?  \n\nSecond how on earth is it possible you are playing DND and also listening to her conversation with the librarian? I'm not saying how is it possible to multitask, but logistically it doesn't make sense why your mom and the librarian would be in the same room as a group playing DnD. There's no way you could play DnD on the open library floor unless you are whispering the whole time, but I would still find it strange that you would also be playing right next to the librarian. \n\nMaybe your stepmom is an asshole but unfortunately I find the retelling of events too strange and biased. Like if your stepmom hated you I would also find it unlikely she would drive you to the library to begin with, let alone stay for 5 hours", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
