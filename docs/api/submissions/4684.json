I'm not saying how is it possible to multitask, but logistically it doesn't make sense why your mom and the librarian would be in the same room as a group playing DnD. There's no way you could play DnD on the open library floor unless you are whispering the whole time, but I would still find it strange that you would also be playing right next to the librarian. \n\nMaybe your stepmom is an asshole but unfortunately I find the retelling of events too strange and biased.

People took horrid advantage of his grief and his fears to pressure him into something he didn\u2019t want. But it should be *very clear* by now that she doesn\u2019t give a rats ass about you. You don\u2019t get special brownie points for caring for a disabled child, *especially* not when you knew about the kid and their disabilities when you married the person. She was an adult and in full knowledge signed up to be a step parent. And she didn\u2019t do a good job.

Imagine the child of a friend, or a cousin, a child that you care about. Imagine that this child came to you and told you that their parent did the things that have been done to you to them. Imagine they told you their hard work and art had been destroyed. Imagine they told you their keepsake jewelry from their deceased parent had been stolen.

None of what you said was overly vicious or mocking (sorry, I'll stop now), it was just a concise rebuttal of lies through use of facts and examples.

But from your post, you listed a few examples of when she snapped throughout your life. Clearly the abusive one is her. Please show the post to your dad.
