They kindly offered to let me stay with my boyfriend and they are not charging him - and by extension me - any rent costs. The only thing we need to pay for is our food which we cook ourselves. We do our own laundry and cleaning. The main condition was that we save rent money and put it towards a house. I try to be as frugal as possible so save pretty much all of my money except for a couple hundred a month for groceries and socialising. Boyfriend makes significantly more than me and also saves. We think we will have the funds in a year. \n\nThis weekend my boyfriend and I went on a short trip so we were not at home for a couple of days. I came back and our room had been \u2018cleaned\u2019 by his mother. She said she had done our laundry and we noticed things were all in the wrong place. We have a desk for WFH and she had decorated the desk with items that had been on the window ledge for a reason- moving my desk setup around. A couple of items have disappeared (like a reed diffuser bottle - empty and cheap but I still don\u2019t think you should throw other peoples belongings away). I also don\u2019t like the idea of her rifling through my stuff or touching my clothes and underwear. Furthermore, some of those clothes need to be on a cold wash and my MIL always puts stuff in a hot wash as she is worried about Covid-19 - I\u2019m worried this has damaged these items. \n\nI keep our room as tidy as possible, dust and hoover frequently. Its a little cluttered as there are two of us living in a small room - I had space next door but for the last few weeks his mother told me to move my stuff out of there as my BF sister had moved back permanently and her own room was being rented to a friend (not for free). I came home from work and all my stuff including medications had been moved on to the floor. \n\nThe last straw was when we went to bed last night we realised she had left the door open all weekend after tidying and the cat had peed on our bed - so we had nowhere to sleep - not what you want after travelling home all day.

If you can put up with having less privacy than you would like for just one year you can set yourself up for life. \n\nI would put up with a lot more than a nosy mother in law for that kind of opportunity and I think if you try to get a lock it isn't going to go down well. \n\nFrankly, there's no way you could do this without their support and paying no rent is an insanely good deal that is only likely to happen once in your life. I'm usually all for setting boundaries but this is a unique, temporary situation that will have far-reaching consequences if you can just get to signing on the dotted line. House prices are finally falling and in a year's time could be an ideal time to buy. Deep breath and stick with it.", "YWNBTA. Considering how much you're following his parents' plans, living under their roof, abiding by their rules, it makes absolute sense that you have SOMETHING that is wholly yours. Saving money is good, but there are other costs, like your independence and agency.\n\nI could see this getting bad enough that you or both of you move out just to have some autonomy and control. Having the bf make the demand or install the lock is a good move (as opposed to you doing it). Definitely press for this action.", "NTA but you do pay the price of free accommodation in lots of other ways.", "YWNBTA. But has your boyfriend ever talked with his mother about this?

You both are entitled to have a private space together.", "ESH. MIL is overstepping a bit. She shouldn't be touching your things or leaving your door open for the cat to get in. She doesn't sound malicious, but she should understand that this isn't your family home, and she's not your mother, so you're not likely to be comfortable with her doing this.\n\nHowever, this isn't your house and you're not paying rent, so you don't have the right to fit a lock onto someone else's property. If you were in a rented property, you would not be allowed to make material changes such as adding locks. Unfortunately you just don't have much leverage in this situation - you're living rent-free in her home.\n\nI think your BF is just going to have to speak to her nicely and ask her not to do your laundry or move/throw away your things, and hope she listens. By all means he could ask to fit a lock. But what if she says no? Otherwise just keep your heads down, save hard, and hopefully mortgage rates will be going down over the next year.", "YWNBTA.", "YWNBTA", "Thanks for your comment - this is what is causing me to be so conflicted. It\u2019s affecting my mental health not having a private space - always having his mum or grandma talking to me or trying to hug me while I\u2019m WFH, often my boyfriend takes the desk in the room and I go downstairs and his mum always comes into the space and hangs her laundry behind me while I\u2019m having meetings (there are literally unused rooms in the house) \n\nLol I went to the gym last week and she asked to come with in exchange for giving me a lift (saves me a half an hour each way on public transport) and tried to talk to me while I was benching mid set and almost caused me to drop the bar. \n\nI\u2019m also being extra frugal and stressing about money more so I can move out of here ASAP.", "It just feels petty considering she rearranged a couple of items. But it\u2019s not the fact that she only moved a couple things - I feel itchy and uncomfortable that someone is touching my stuff (that isn\u2019t my boyfriend who shares the space with me) without my consent.", "He has told her off in the past but she will either deny it or say he needs to clean more as she finds it too stressful. I think he\u2019s had this problem with her since he was a kid though. \n\nI try to empathise because being a woman and being held responsible for domestic labour is hard.  Women are often accused of being naggy trying to keep the home running smoothly. \n\nHowever, she works part time and we both work full time, and I still try to keep things tidy. I never asked her to tidy our space and the door is closed most of the time so she wouldn\u2019t even see it. \n\nAlso feels like neither of us can do anything right. We wash up after ourselves (but we left a splash of water on the side). I was on my period and put a sanitary product in the bin and she told MY BOYFRIEND off for putting it in the bin (honestly not sure what to do there either - I put it in the bin and then when we clean the bathroom we empty the bin?). It\u2019s also not even her bathroom she has an en suite. So me and my boyfriend (and now his sister) are the only ones that use it.", "Why do you think this? I don\u2019t necessarily disagree but I would appreciate some more info.", "As well you should. From what you describe, you have very little control over the situation, and that can really fuck with you. By having a room for yourself (and your bf) you can relax, enjoy, be yourself without worry, and be together. Without that space, you're always going to be tense and feel diminished. Everyone needs their own space.", "You moved into a place neither of you own or pay rent in. Neither of you have a final say in anything that happens to you, your stuff, or your time. Landlords can\u2019t waste your time or disrespect you as much as someone doing you a favor. Suck it up and learn this lesson now and try not to do it to anyone else as you get older.", "Honestly I was expecting a lot of YTA for wanting to control things when I\u2019m a guest in their home. So this is really making me feel better - like I\u2019m not being unreasonable for wanting some privacy", "Thanks for the comment. It\u2019s hard because my boyfriend is just staying in his family home until he can afford to move so that\u2019s quite normal - but for me I\u2019m starting to crave my own space.", "Agree with this comment but to add.... Maybe no lock on the door but a lockable cabinet, lock box or similar you could slide under the bed or in the closet, for stuff you REALLY don't want touched or to disappear.\n\nDeep breaths! Good luck!", "Is there somewhere you can go to work during the day. Maybe not every day but once a week or so? When I worked from home, I still went to the office once a week or out to a cafe to do emails etc just for a break and it helped a lot - it might be useful for you to have that space, both physically and mentally.", "I go into the office once or twice a week. \n\nThe only problem is cost - I have to buy a train ticket or pass and that can add up quick. The more I can save the quicker I can move. \n\nIt also costs the company money as our office space is charged per person in the office per day. They are a great company and would let me work everyday for my own well-being, but there would be nobody from my company in the space. Therefore I\u2019d be paying out loads in train fare to sit in the office on my own - as most people have reduced their office days since the move to this place", "No. But the reality is that you need to find ways that either work within the constraints of your current living situation (a locked box, a strap that locks to keep her out of your drawers during holidays) or possibly move out if you really need the privacy", "You have to decide if it\u2019s worth it to live with her to save up faster. If you stay with her and it\u2019s not feasible to get a locked knob, put your stuff like medications in a locked box and they make locks that can fit around a dresser for when you\u2019re out of town. I think that I\u2019d try to power through but you\u2019ll have to make that decision for yourself.", "Look I think this is a control thing on the part of his mum. I think that\u2019s fairly obvious, so you have to ask yourself, \u201cCan I deal with this for a year ?\u201d and also, \u201cWhat can I do to mitigate this ?\u201d\n\nSo I mentioned working at a local library or cafe for a couple of days or half days a week, which might be a good start to give you some breathing space. \n\nCan you put meds and other precious things in a minisafe ? Say that you\u2019re worried to lose them and they\u2019ve been moved.\n\nGet a sign for the door \u201cIn A Meeting Do Not Disturb\u201d and then if anyone comes in, bustle them out immediately \u201dOh I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry this is a really important meeting, confidential commercial information, sorry sorry I put the sign up, didn\u2019t you see it ? Bye\u201d\n\nIf she tries to get offended afterwards, reiterate \u201cSorry, I put the sign up, we\u2019re dealing with confidential information its really important, I\u2019m so sorry - its what the company has asked for and I really can\u2019t have people come in during a meeting or while I\u2019m working with confidential information, sorry.\u201d\n\nBasically you\u2019re going for \u201cCheerful And Apologetic, But Firm\u201d\n\nFor myself, I\u2019m not sure I could put up with this. In my experience, freedom is worth an extra few years of saving, rather than being at the mercy of a domestic tyrant. I chose to live alone and live off baked beans after four years of house shares. \n\nI\u2019d rather be poor and hungry than have to put up with other people\u2019s shit, and in my opinion, the money is never worth it, especially when its being held over your head like this. You may feel differently, but have a long hard think about it. You may be happier in a tiny bedsit with a lock on the door, and a savings plan that runs to 5 years instead of 1. I know I would be :)\n\nNTA. But **do** have a backup escape plan if its all too much. You *can* just go back and live with your family, right ? Even if its without your boyfriend\u2026. For a year.", "It was your boyfriend's idea to put in a lock. All you have to do is not be against that. It's pretty clear that his family doesn't do boundaries so they'll probably just put up with it if it comes from him. \n\nYour only alternative is to loudly say you can't live with this any longer and that you don't care if it sets you back ten years on the property ladder, you're finding a rental this minute unless these people can find a way to stay out of your knicker drawer. And that seems unnecessarily dramatic if you can make Plan A work. \n\nNTA.", "YWNBTA - but living under someone else\u2019s roof, makes full privacy pretty hard. As awful as it is, you have another year to save money to get a place. You are very lucky to have this opportunity. You may get kicked out of the house if this goes to far? Your boyfriend will be able to set some boundaries but it depends on the parents themselves. They should be some wriggle room for a no visiting policy during work hours, no laundry \u201chelp\u201d, and no entering room for cleaning unless cleared by you. Have you already brought this up formally?", "I know - it\u2019s what to do about it. \n\nI can ignore it and power through, we can get a lock, my boyfriend can try and get through to her, I can move out, me and my boyfriend can pull together what we have and try and buy a home now and hope our finances allow for it. Not really sure what option is best.", "My boyfriend has mentioned it many times - it has been a problem for his whole life apparently and he has lost some precious items that have been \u2018cleaned\u2019 away. \n\nWhile he was at uni she gave away some of his ties to his Nans husband because he \u2018never uses them\u2019 - he graduated and started work and had to wear a suit and spent a good couple months looking for this missing tie. Nans husband mentioned it in passing and my BF was like wtf.\n\n\nI\u2019m not fussed for \u2018full privacy\u2019 I just want my things not to be rifled through and thrown away when I am not in the house. Me and my BF are not messy people so there\u2019s no reason for her to go and clean it again when we do it regularly.", "I don't think the lock idea will fly and it is his mom's house, so her rules apply. I agree with a lock box for valuables, but you can't lock up your underwear, all of your meds, etc. MIL is nosy and exhausting to be around. I know you want to save for a house, but it sounds like this situation is untenable so moving is the best option. Good luck.\n\nNTA", "Ok so option C has failed repeatedly, she\u2019s not going to play along. Only you know if you can power through. You can try getting a lock, but it sounds like she\u2019d lose her blob if you did this, it might be worth it, and then have a backup plan to move out if she does. \n\nOr you could go for a home - if you both WFH, can you get a small place, further out perhaps ? I mean all you need is internet - you could move to the Outer Hebrides\u2026. Joking but you know what I mean.\n\nOr you could just not live together. An awful lot of this sounds like him and his parent\u2019s idea - live together, in one tiny room, at his parent\u2019s house, under her beady eye, with no power and no privacy. He\u2019s used to it, but you\u2019re not. \n\nAnd that\u2019s the true value of renting - its not wasted money if you get freedom and privacy in return. \n\nFor myself, I don\u2019t think it hurts to live for a bit on your own anyway. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve done this, or if you moved straight in with him after Uni, but the freedom of your own tiny flat is most certainly **not** money wasted. Here in Western Australia its called \u201cQuiet Enjoyment\u201d of a property and its part of a tenant\u2019s rights. Its also something you don\u2019t have, along with basic privacy, or control over whether or not your things are moved, ruined, or stolen (which is what we call taking someone\u2019s stuff without asking them - stealing)\n\nOn a side note, if you go ahead and buy a house with him, this woman is going to be your MIL for a long time. I\u2019d put her in her place now or she\u2019ll steamroller you for as long as you\u2019re with him. And that\u2019s hard to do if you\u2019re dependant on her for a roof over your head. \n\nGah I\u2019m twitching now and I\u2019m not you. You may be a far more placid and patient person than I am, and able to \u201cpower through\u201d, but frankly I\u2019d \u201cpower off\u201d and find somewhere else to live. Or just go home for a couple of weeks to recuperate and then move into your own place. If your relationship is strong it will last despite not immediately living with each other. And it will send her a strong message that you won\u2019t put up with her behaviour.", "Ok, so clearly she has long standing boundary issues. Your boyfriend can broach the lock idea, but there may be some major blowback\u2026 be prepared for the guilt trip, or worse.", "I mean it is his mum and his dads house - I think he would be more relaxed about it.", "What about working from a local library a couple of days a week ? Or half days ? Or a local cafe ? For the cost of a sandwich and a couple of pots of tea you can work for a few hours before or after the lunch rush. It\u2019ll get you out of the house and give you some breathing space. \n\nLibraries are often set up with study corrals which would be perfect for you.", "Go to a library", "You could also consider \"shared working spaces\" if there's any locally, but they're generally not cheap either.\n\nIn the end, if you want to live with your BF, presuming you're living in somewhere fairly popular, it's likely to be \u00a31k+ all in (and in London, way more than that of course) - I look at these things as \"If someone paid me \u00a31k a month extra to do this, would I?\"\n\nThat's lead me to some compromised living situations, but no regrets as did get me a deposit.", "As a fellow person with anxiety, if going into the office more means you can get through this living situation, you should do it. Train fare adds up but it\u2019s a pittance compared to rent. Also don\u2019t let yourself care that you going into work \u201ccosts the company money,\u201d because you\u2019re actively earning them money by working for them.\n\nBy living with his family you\u2019re already doing the thing that will allow you to save up enough to buy a home. You also say that he makes significantly more than you and is also saving. Don\u2019t push the narrative to yourself that train fare to get to work is *the* thing that\u2019s holding you two back, because it\u2019s not. Think of it as a fixed expense.", "Company already uses one of those spaces. Honestly my job has already told me I can go in every day - but it\u2019s the train fair + commute to be on my own in the office (other people might be there, but no coworkers so I would need to ) where it just seems like a waste of time and money."]}
