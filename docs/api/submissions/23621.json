It was my boyfriends idea - my family live a few hours away and don\u2019t have much space whereas his family have a spare room and my boyfriend\u2019s room for us to use. \n\nCrucially - his parents think renting is a waste of money so we my boyfriend needs to save to buy a house within the UK. This then affects me if I want to live with him right now. We have recently graduated university so don\u2019t have the funds for a deposit to move out yet. They kindly offered to let me stay with my boyfriend and they are not charging him - and by extension me - any rent costs. The only thing we need to pay for is our food which we cook ourselves. We do our own laundry and cleaning. The main condition was that we save rent money and put it towards a house. I try to be as frugal as possible so save pretty much all of my money except for a couple hundred a month for groceries and socialising. Boyfriend makes significantly more than me and also saves. We think we will have the funds in a year. \n\nThis weekend my boyfriend and I went on a short trip so we were not at home for a couple of days. I came back and our room had been \u2018cleaned\u2019 by his mother. She said she had done our laundry and we noticed things were all in the wrong place. We have a desk for WFH and she had decorated the desk with items that had been on the window ledge for a reason- moving my desk setup around. A couple of items have disappeared (like a reed diffuser bottle - empty and cheap but I still don\u2019t think you should throw other peoples belongings away). I also don\u2019t like the idea of her rifling through my stuff or touching my clothes and underwear. Furthermore, some of those clothes need to be on a cold wash and my MIL always puts stuff in a hot wash as she is worried about Covid-19 - I\u2019m worried this has damaged these items. \n\nI keep our room as tidy as possible, dust and hoover frequently. Its a little cluttered as there are two of us living in a small room - I had space next door but for the last few weeks his mother told me to move my stuff out of there as my BF sister had moved back permanently and her own room was being rented to a friend (not for free). I came home from work and all my stuff including medications had been moved on to the floor. \n\nThe last straw was when we went to bed last night we realised she had left the door open all weekend after tidying and the cat had peed on our bed - so we had nowhere to sleep - not what you want after travelling home all day. I got very upset last night (as did my BF) as I feel like I don\u2019t have a private space where my things won\u2019t be interfered with. \n\nMy boyfriend remarked he should have a lock on his bedroom door - I\u2019m inclined to encourage him to do this until we can afford to move. However it\u2019s not my house and my boyfriend doesn\u2019t pay to live at home.

If you can put up with having less privacy than you would like for just one year you can set yourself up for life. \n\nI would put up with a lot more than a nosy mother in law for that kind of opportunity and I think if you try to get a lock it isn't going to go down well. \n\nFrankly, there's no way you could do this without their support and paying no rent is an insanely good deal that is only likely to happen once in your life. I'm usually all for setting boundaries but this is a unique, temporary situation that will have far-reaching consequences if you can just get to signing on the dotted line. House prices are finally falling and in a year's time could be an ideal time to buy. Deep breath and stick with it.", "YWNBTA. Considering how much you're following his parents' plans, living under their roof, abiding by their rules, it makes absolute sense that you have SOMETHING that is wholly yours. Saving money is good, but there are other costs, like your independence and agency.\n\nI could see this getting bad enough that you or both of you move out just to have some autonomy and control. Having the bf make the demand or install the lock is a good move (as opposed to you doing it). Definitely press for this action.", "NTA but you do pay the price of free accommodation in lots of other ways.", "YWNBTA. But has your boyfriend ever talked with his mother about this? I think he should first try to communicate his and yours need for privacy. Maybe she will just agree and the problem will be solved.", "NTA. Leave ASAP.

You both are entitled to have a private space together.", "ESH. MIL is overstepping a bit. She shouldn't be touching your things or leaving your door open for the cat to get in. She doesn't sound malicious, but she should understand that this isn't your family home, and she's not your mother, so you're not likely to be comfortable with her doing this.\n\nHowever, this isn't your house and you're not paying rent, so you don't have the right to fit a lock onto someone else's property. If you were in a rented property, you would not be allowed to make material changes such as adding locks. Unfortunately you just don't have much leverage in this situation - you're living rent-free in her home.\n\nI think your BF is just going to have to speak to her nicely and ask her not to do your laundry or move/throw away your things, and hope she listens. By all means he could ask to fit a lock. But what if she says no? Otherwise just keep your heads down, save hard, and hopefully mortgage rates will be going down over the next year.", "YWNBTA.", "YWNBTA", "Thanks for your comment - this is what is causing me to be so conflicted. It\u2019s affecting my mental health not having a private space - always having his mum or grandma talking to me or trying to hug me while I\u2019m WFH, often my boyfriend takes the desk in the room and I go downstairs and his mum always comes into the space and hangs her laundry behind me while I\u2019m having meetings (there are literally unused rooms in the house) \n\nLol I went to the gym last week and she asked to come with in exchange for giving me a lift (saves me a half an hour each way on public transport) and tried to talk to me while I was benching mid set and almost caused me to drop the bar. \n\nI\u2019m also being extra frugal and stressing about money more so I can move out of here ASAP.", "It just feels petty considering she rearranged a couple of items. But it\u2019s not the fact that she only moved a couple things - I feel itchy and uncomfortable that someone is touching my stuff (that isn\u2019t my boyfriend who shares the space with me) without my consent.", "He has told her off in the past but she will either deny it or say he needs to clean more as she finds it too stressful. I think he\u2019s had this problem with her since he was a kid though. \n\nI try to empathise because being a woman and being held responsible for domestic labour is hard.  Women are often accused of being naggy trying to keep the home running smoothly. \n\nHowever, she works part time and we both work full time, and I still try to keep things tidy. I never asked her to tidy our space and the door is closed most of the time so she wouldn\u2019t even see it. \n\nAlso feels like neither of us can do anything right. We wash up after ourselves (but we left a splash of water on the side). I was on my period and put a sanitary product in the bin and she told MY BOYFRIEND off for putting it in the bin (honestly not sure what to do there either - I put it in the bin and then when we clean the bathroom we empty the bin?). It\u2019s also not even her bathroom she has an en suite. So me and my boyfriend (and now his sister) are the only ones that use it.", "Why do you think this? I don\u2019t necessarily disagree but I would appreciate some more info.", "As well you should. From what you describe, you have very little control over the situation, and that can really fuck with you. By having a room for yourself (and your bf) you can relax, enjoy, be yourself without worry, and be together. Without that space, you're always going to be tense and feel diminished. Everyone needs their own space.", "You moved into a place neither of you own or pay rent in. Neither of you have a final say in anything that happens to you, your stuff, or your time. Landlords can\u2019t waste your time or disrespect you as much as someone doing you a favor. Suck it up and learn this lesson now and try not to do it to anyone else as you get older.", "Honestly I was expecting a lot of YTA for wanting to control things when I\u2019m a guest in their home. So this is really making me feel better - like I\u2019m not being unreasonable for wanting some privacy", "Thanks for the comment. It\u2019s hard because my boyfriend is just staying in his family home until he can afford to move so that\u2019s quite normal - but for me I\u2019m starting to crave my own space."]}
