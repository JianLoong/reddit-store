If you can put up with having less privacy than you would like for just one year you can set yourself up for life. \n\nI would put up with a lot more than a nosy mother in law for that kind of opportunity and I think if you try to get a lock it isn't going to go down well. \n\nFrankly, there's no way you could do this without their support and paying no rent is an insanely good deal that is only likely to happen once in your life. I'm usually all for setting boundaries but this is a unique, temporary situation that will have far-reaching consequences if you can just get to signing on the dotted line. House prices are finally falling and in a year's time could be an ideal time to buy. Deep breath and stick with it.", "YWNBTA.

Having the bf make the demand or install the lock is a good move (as opposed to you doing it).

You both are entitled to have a private space together.", "ESH. MIL is overstepping a bit. She shouldn't be touching your things or leaving your door open for the cat to get in. She doesn't sound malicious, but she should understand that this isn't your family home, and she's not your mother, so you're not likely to be comfortable with her doing this.\n\nHowever, this isn't your house and you're not paying rent, so you don't have the right to fit a lock onto someone else's property. If you were in a rented property, you would not be allowed to make material changes such as adding locks. Unfortunately you just don't have much leverage in this situation - you're living rent-free in her home.\n\nI think your BF is just going to have to speak to her nicely and ask her not to do your laundry or move/throw away your things, and hope she listens. By all means he could ask to fit a lock. But what if she says no? Otherwise just keep your heads down, save hard, and hopefully mortgage rates will be going down over the next year.", "YWNBTA.", "YWNBTA", "Thanks for your comment - this is what is causing me to be so conflicted. It\u2019s affecting my mental health not having a private space - always having his mum or grandma talking to me or trying to hug me while I\u2019m WFH, often my boyfriend takes the desk in the room and I go downstairs and his mum always comes into the space and hangs her laundry behind me while I\u2019m having meetings (there are literally unused rooms in the house) \n\nLol I went to the gym last week and she asked to come with in exchange for giving me a lift (saves me a half an hour each way on public transport) and tried to talk to me while I was benching mid set and almost caused me to drop the bar. \n\nI\u2019m also being extra frugal and stressing about money more so I can move out of here ASAP.", "It just feels petty considering she rearranged a couple of items. But it\u2019s not the fact that she only moved a couple things - I feel itchy and uncomfortable that someone is touching my stuff (that isn\u2019t my boyfriend who shares the space with me) without my consent.", "He has told her off in the past but she will either deny it or say he needs to clean more as she finds it too stressful. I think he\u2019s had this problem with her since he was a kid though. \n\nI try to empathise because being a woman and being held responsible for domestic labour is hard.  Women are often accused of being naggy trying to keep the home running smoothly. \n\nHowever, she works part time and we both work full time, and I still try to keep things tidy. I never asked her to tidy our space and the door is closed most of the time so she wouldn\u2019t even see it. \n\nAlso feels like neither of us can do anything right. We wash up after ourselves (but we left a splash of water on the side). I was on my period and put a sanitary product in the bin and she told MY BOYFRIEND off for putting it in the bin (honestly not sure what to do there either - I put it in the bin and then when we clean the bathroom we empty the bin?). It\u2019s also not even her bathroom she has an en suite. So me and my boyfriend (and now his sister) are the only ones that use it.", "Why do you think this? I don\u2019t necessarily disagree but I would appreciate some more info.", "As well you should. From what you describe, you have very little control over the situation, and that can really fuck with you. By having a room for yourself (and your bf) you can relax, enjoy, be yourself without worry, and be together. Without that space, you're always going to be tense and feel diminished. Everyone needs their own space.", "You moved into a place neither of you own or pay rent in. Neither of you have a final say in anything that happens to you, your stuff, or your time. Landlords can\u2019t waste your time or disrespect you as much as someone doing you a favor. Suck it up and learn this lesson now and try not to do it to anyone else as you get older.", "Honestly I was expecting a lot of YTA for wanting to control things when I\u2019m a guest in their home. So this is really making me feel better - like I\u2019m not being unreasonable for wanting some privacy", "Thanks for the comment. It\u2019s hard because my boyfriend is just staying in his family home until he can afford to move so that\u2019s quite normal - but for me I\u2019m starting to crave my own space.", "Agree with this comment but to add.... Maybe no lock on the door but a lockable cabinet, lock box or similar you could slide under the bed or in the closet, for stuff you REALLY don't want touched or to disappear.\n\nDeep breaths! Good luck!", "Is there somewhere you can go to work during the day. Maybe not every day but once a week or so? When I worked from home, I still went to the office once a week or out to a cafe to do emails etc just for a break and it helped a lot - it might be useful for you to have that space, both physically and mentally.", "I go into the office once or twice a week. \n\nThe only problem is cost - I have to buy a train ticket or pass and that can add up quick. The more I can save the quicker I can move. \n\nIt also costs the company money as our office space is charged per person in the office per day. They are a great company and would let me work everyday for my own well-being, but there would be nobody from my company in the space. Therefore I\u2019d be paying out loads in train fare to sit in the office on my own - as most people have reduced their office days since the move to this place", "No. But the reality is that you need to find ways that either work within the constraints of your current living situation (a locked box, a strap that locks to keep her out of your drawers during holidays) or possibly move out if you really need the privacy", "You have to decide if it\u2019s worth it to live with her to save up faster. If you stay with her and it\u2019s not feasible to get a locked knob, put your stuff like medications in a locked box and they make locks that can fit around a dresser for when you\u2019re out of town. I think that I\u2019d try to power through but you\u2019ll have to make that decision for yourself.", "Look I think this is a control thing on the part of his mum. I think that\u2019s fairly obvious, so you have to ask yourself, \u201cCan I deal with this for a year ?\u201d and also, \u201cWhat can I do to mitigate this ?\u201d\n\nSo I mentioned working at a local library or cafe for a couple of days or half days a week, which might be a good start to give you some breathing space. \n\nCan you put meds and other precious things in a minisafe ? Say that you\u2019re worried to lose them and they\u2019ve been moved.\n\nGet a sign for the door \u201cIn A Meeting Do Not Disturb\u201d and then if anyone comes in, bustle them out immediately \u201dOh I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry this is a really important meeting, confidential commercial information, sorry sorry I put the sign up, didn\u2019t you see it ? Bye\u201d\n\nIf she tries to get offended afterwards, reiterate \u201cSorry, I put the sign up, we\u2019re dealing with confidential information its really important, I\u2019m so sorry - its what the company has asked for and I really can\u2019t have people come in during a meeting or while I\u2019m working with confidential information, sorry.\u201d\n\nBasically you\u2019re going for \u201cCheerful And Apologetic, But Firm\u201d\n\nFor myself, I\u2019m not sure I could put up with this. In my experience, freedom is worth an extra few years of saving, rather than being at the mercy of a domestic tyrant. I chose to live alone and live off baked beans after four years of house shares. \n\nI\u2019d rather be poor and hungry than have to put up with other people\u2019s shit, and in my opinion, the money is never worth it, especially when its being held over your head like this. You may feel differently, but have a long hard think about it. You may be happier in a tiny bedsit with a lock on the door, and a savings plan that runs to 5 years instead of 1. I know I would be :)\n\nNTA. But **do** have a backup escape plan if its all too much. You *can* just go back and live with your family, right ? Even if its without your boyfriend\u2026. For a year.", "It was your boyfriend's idea to put in a lock. All you have to do is not be against that. It's pretty clear that his family doesn't do boundaries so they'll probably just put up with it if it comes from him. \n\nYour only alternative is to loudly say you can't live with this any longer and that you don't care if it sets you back ten years on the property ladder, you're finding a rental this minute unless these people can find a way to stay out of your knicker drawer. And that seems unnecessarily dramatic if you can make Plan A work. \n\nNTA.", "YWNBTA - but living under someone else\u2019s roof, makes full privacy pretty hard. As awful as it is, you have another year to save money to get a place. You are very lucky to have this opportunity. You may get kicked out of the house if this goes to far? Your boyfriend will be able to set some boundaries but it depends on the parents themselves. They should be some wriggle room for a no visiting policy during work hours, no laundry \u201chelp\u201d, and no entering room for cleaning unless cleared by you. Have you already brought this up formally?", "I know - it\u2019s what to do about it. \n\nI can ignore it and power through, we can get a lock, my boyfriend can try and get through to her, I can move out, me and my boyfriend can pull together what we have and try and buy a home now and hope our finances allow for it. Not really sure what option is best.", "My boyfriend has mentioned it many times - it has been a problem for his whole life apparently and he has lost some precious items that have been \u2018cleaned\u2019 away. \n\nWhile he was at uni she gave away some of his ties to his Nans husband because he \u2018never uses them\u2019 - he graduated and started work and had to wear a suit and spent a good couple months looking for this missing tie. Nans husband mentioned it in passing and my BF was like wtf.\n\n\nI\u2019m not fussed for \u2018full privacy\u2019 I just want my things not to be rifled through and thrown away when I am not in the house. Me and my BF are not messy people so there\u2019s no reason for her to go and clean it again when we do it regularly.", "I don't think the lock idea will fly and it is his mom's house, so her rules apply. I agree with a lock box for valuables, but you can't lock up your underwear, all of your meds, etc. MIL is nosy and exhausting to be around. I know you want to save for a house, but it sounds like this situation is untenable so moving is the best option. Good luck.\n\nNTA", "Ok so option C has failed repeatedly, she\u2019s not going to play along. Only you know if you can power through. You can try getting a lock, but it sounds like she\u2019d lose her blob if you did this, it might be worth it, and then have a backup plan to move out if she does. \n\nOr you could go for a home - if you both WFH, can you get a small place, further out perhaps ? I mean all you need is internet - you could move to the Outer Hebrides\u2026. Joking but you know what I mean.\n\nOr you could just not live together. An awful lot of this sounds like him and his parent\u2019s idea - live together, in one tiny room, at his parent\u2019s house, under her beady eye, with no power and no privacy. He\u2019s used to it, but you\u2019re not. \n\nAnd that\u2019s the true value of renting - its not wasted money if you get freedom and privacy in return. \n\nFor myself, I don\u2019t think it hurts to live for a bit on your own anyway. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve done this, or if you moved straight in with him after Uni, but the freedom of your own tiny flat is most certainly **not** money wasted. Here in Western Australia its called \u201cQuiet Enjoyment\u201d of a property and its part of a tenant\u2019s rights. Its also something you don\u2019t have, along with basic privacy, or control over whether or not your things are moved, ruined, or stolen (which is what we call taking someone\u2019s stuff without asking them - stealing)\n\nOn a side note, if you go ahead and buy a house with him, this woman is going to be your MIL for a long time. I\u2019d put her in her place now or she\u2019ll steamroller you for as long as you\u2019re with him. And that\u2019s hard to do if you\u2019re dependant on her for a roof over your head. \n\nGah I\u2019m twitching now and I\u2019m not you. You may be a far more placid and patient person than I am, and able to \u201cpower through\u201d, but frankly I\u2019d \u201cpower off\u201d and find somewhere else to live. Or just go home for a couple of weeks to recuperate and then move into your own place. If your relationship is strong it will last despite not immediately living with each other. And it will send her a strong message that you won\u2019t put up with her behaviour.", "Ok, so clearly she has long standing boundary issues. Your boyfriend can broach the lock idea, but there may be some major blowback\u2026 be prepared for the guilt trip, or worse.", "I mean it is his mum and his dads house - I think he would be more relaxed about it.", "What about working from a local library a couple of days a week ? Or half days ? Or a local cafe ? For the cost of a sandwich and a couple of pots of tea you can work for a few hours before or after the lunch rush. It\u2019ll get you out of the house and give you some breathing space. \n\nLibraries are often set up with study corrals which would be perfect for you.", "Go to a library", "You could also consider \"shared working spaces\" if there's any locally, but they're generally not cheap either.\n\nIn the end, if you want to live with your BF, presuming you're living in somewhere fairly popular, it's likely to be \u00a31k+ all in (and in London, way more than that of course) - I look at these things as \"If someone paid me \u00a31k a month extra to do this, would I?\"\n\nThat's lead me to some compromised living situations, but no regrets as did get me a deposit.", "As a fellow person with anxiety, if going into the office more means you can get through this living situation, you should do it.

Honestly my job has already told me I can go in every day - but it\u2019s the train fair + commute to be on my own in the office (other people might be there, but no coworkers so I would need to ) where it just seems like a waste of time and money.", "YWBTA to put a lock on a door of a space that you do not have 'title' to either through a lease or mortgage.  The solution is to move out.  Saving money is noble but the cost of your privacy/sanity/family relations is too high.  Set a short timeline (under three months) to find a place to live.  If BF is not willing, then leave on your own.", "NTA\n\nMy suggestion would be to go in hard with the cat pee situation to underline why you don't want the door left open.\n\nNot wanting to find cat pee in strange places is a great reason to keep doors shut.", "NTA but maybe make it about the cat piss.", "YWNBTA I couldn't stand the thought that someone would come into my room/house and just  touch my underwear.\n\nDid you have a conversation with your MIL about while you appreciate her effort, you would really prefer that she left your laundry (etc.) alone?", "NTA but uhhhhhh you need to leave. I\u2019ve been stuck in your current situation for the last 3 years and the ugliest fights have happened because my MIL doesn\u2019t respect privacy and because she\u2019s very controlling. Wish I would\u2019ve left earlier. For your own sanity, please move back in with YOUR family if you have the option.", "This isn't really an aita. You don't need to ask strangers on the internet if you're allowed to lock your bedroom door", "NTA. I find it ironic that the parents are opposed to their son paying rent to someone else, but they're not above having someone else pay to rent a room from them. Seems a little hypocritical of them.\n\nDoes the mom invade the privacy of this friend that is renting a room the same way she does her son, and by extension, you? If she doesn't, there may be another option hiding there.\n\nYou start paying rent. BF doesn't even have to. You can argue that you're not family and you really should be paying rent. If they take it, you can use it to say you expect the same privacy as the friend. If they refuse on the grounds that you are family, you can use it as an opening to a conversation that an adult living there wgo isn't family is given the respect and privacy they deserve. But because you are seen as family, you don't. Despite also being an adult equally deserving of respect and privacy.\n\nIf she does also invade the property of the renting friend, talk to them about getting into the conversation also. If all three of you are together on getting locks, or even just talking about the invasions that make you want one, it will be harder to for mom to deflect the issue. On the flip side, if they're not on board with the conversation, you risk having them dragged in as a \"see!it doesn't bother them\" example.\n\nSide-note: You mentioned that mom has done this stuff to BF since he was young. She may not be deliberately invading your privacy. She may not even be deliberately invading her son's privacy. She just may still be thinking of him as a young child with little to no expectation of privacy. If she can't grok that he's an adult, with a need for privacy, of course she won't give it. If she can't grok that for him, she may not even be trying to consider that you're a separate person, and should be getting it also. She may, at some level, just be viewing you as an extension of him.\n\nGetting her to acknowledge that adults in general deserve some privacy would be a good first step to any conversation. If you can get her to acknowledge that then you're halfway there. Then you can work on the point that you and BF are adults. At that point, she'll either be faced with acknowledging that you two deserve privacy, or will openly admit that she sees BF and you(?) as children that need close parenting. Either of which will be significant progress.", "YWNBTA.  You have every right to privacy.  And even though you're living in her home, she doesn not have the right to go into your room to clean or to do anything else.  She completely overstepped & disrespected you.  However, putting a lock on your door may cause more issues with her.  She is most likely not going to be happy about it & maybe even be offended.     Have you & your boyfriend made it clear to her that she is not to come into the room when you're not there?  I think you need to do that first.", "Hahaha this made me laugh, thanks! \n\nIt\u2019s just his mum, nobody else interferes. I work by the kitchen often and his dad always asks if he can make a coffee or if that will disturb me if I\u2019m in a meeting and that\u2019s the extent of the disruption lol. His sister will just be around the house, the only disruption is sharing a bathroom and occasionally using my bathroom stuff - but she\u2019s young and I\u2019m not petty enough to care about a bit of shampoo lol", "Oh my own mother is worse, I ask her not to come in my room and she says that it\u2019s her house and she deserves to have a clean home. And no matter what I cleaned there was always something I had forgotten. I used to tidy my sisters room while she was at work (who is very very messy due to ADHD) so my mum wouldn\u2019t go in and do it and cause a raging argument. \n\nMy parents also wanted me to pay them rent - a small amount but also stops me saving as much. Cost of living in that part of the country is also high and I wouldn\u2019t be able to go into the office as it\u2019s several hours away. There\u2019s nowhere for me to WFH either. I\u2019d have to find a new job.", "For clarity - the friend is no longer renting. She was temporarily in BF sisters room while she was working abroad. MIL rented the room out as a favour to BFs Sister (it\u2019s sisters friend). She said she isn\u2019t family so it isn\u2019t fair she gets to live for free. She also said this is why renting is such a bad idea because you end up in sticky situation like the friend needing a place to stay. Frustrates me as it\u2019s genuinely like a disconnect from reality and how privileged she is. \n\nHowever she had to move back in early. The plan was to stay with another family member but I offered my BFs Sister the room as she came back and clearly was struggling with seeing her friend staying in her own bedroom - I was quite happy to help her settle in. \n\nHowever, the next day I was at work and got a text from MIL saying btw could she move sister into my room, and I came back and my stuff had already been moved. I was really upset because I had offered to room privately to his sister and suddenly MIL had made it into her choice and taken it upon herself to move everything. I felt kind of like I\u2019d never had a choice to offer the room anyway. \n\nThe friend then moved out a couple of days ago without telling anyone - so I thought maybe she\u2019d felt a bit pushed out.", "How about if YOU take the desk in your room and your bf goes downstairs when you're both working from home? It's his mum so I'm sure he is more comfortable telling her to back off / give him space when he's working remotely than you are, so it makes sense to me that he should be the one that goes into the shared space to work.", "Buy a lock for the  wardrobe and a water  resisant sheet. Put the sheet on the bed when you leave the room and you both lock everything you care for in the wardrobe.\n\nNTA but she might be 'offended' if she doesn't have access to the room. She can hardly be that offended if you protect your things 'from the cat' in your wardrobe.\n\nShe's going to sound like a lunatic if she complained about that because you can ask what is so important for her to know to want to snoop in your private stuff whereas the room itself is  part of her house.\n\n\nInvestin somemade in china organizers for the wardrobe (textile bags etc) and reorganize your room with the most important/private/sensitive stuff in the wardrobe.", "Honestly, between the above comment, and the one from this link\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15f5c93/wibta_for_putting_a_lock_on_our_bedroom_door_so/juc96z1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2\n\nYou really should buckle down\n\nThey aren't wrong that for 1 year of hardships, you get set for life.\n\nI agree that you wouldn't be the asshole, but you defo would be foolish to risk it.\n\nI would kill to have the deal you are having. For other than the mil not having good boundaries, it seems like she just wants to bond.\n\nIf you really want to succeed both financially and emotionally with your bf, it would be really important to changed the narrative you say to ur self.\n\n\nThis is highly important, as emphasized in the comment I linked. Make yourself think that YES, your mental peace is being hurt, but ALSO, that you are Willingly Doing it for a chance to get ahead in your own home. AND, by tightening your mental belt, you can ALSO build a strong foundation with a future in law.\n\nBoil the frog slowly, actively try to spend time with her. Bond, and slowly work towards the goal. Will be harder initially, but easier once you have made a base.", "Thanks for the clarification.\n\nThat the friend has left may torpedo some of the possible avenues I was envisioning might be there. But what you describe here meshes with my side thoughts.\n\nIt does sound like she has trouble accepting that her kids are adults who can manage stuff on their own, and that stuff needs to be discussed before she just goes and does them. You're probably getting treated that way because you're her son's partner.\n\nThe friend may have also been getting treated that way because they were a friend of the daughter, especially if they'd been friends for years. Could be part of why the friend moved out abruptly. Tired of being treated like a little kid.\n\nYou mentioned BFs dad is more mindful. It may be worth considering a private converstion with him about the issues you're seeing. He may be aware of them, but not the extent to which they've become an issue. If he can be made an ally, no matter what route you end up going, things will go much better.", "We have done this to make things fair already :) I only work downstairs more than him because I prefer to not be in the same room 24/7 whereas he isn\u2019t bothered by this at all lol.", "Definitely leaning towards a small place - we have enough money saved, just much less disposable \u2018spare\u2019 cash in an emergency. Ideally I wanted more of a safety net before buying a home.", "Honestly, do not complain then....", "This part is simple - HE can go into the \"public\" rooms, as she's his mother. That shouldn't be on you.", "I think your math is a little off here.\n\nA deposit for a home purchase is going to be at least 10,000 pounds, right? \n\nA train ticket is what? 20 pounds? Going to the office 1-2x a week is 160 pounds, for your sanity\u2019s sake. \n\nSaving is good. But you have to balance saving with your sanity. You are going to have a relationship with your future MIL until she *dies*. Easing the stress now is good.\n\nAlso 160 pounds is the cost of one therapy appointment. Office is cheaper.", "Well I am some rando on the internet, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re getting good advice from elsewhere here as well. What about IRL ? What do your parents have to say about it ? \n\nOr maybe you have a financially savvy Auntie or Uncle you could talk to about it, and get some opinions and ideas based around buying a small place in and around your area ?\n\nI was always told \u201cget in as fast as you can\u201d - but that might not be applicable to your situation (and I ignored that advice anyway - the housing market here is bonkers) - maybe you have someone else apart from your bf and his parents to go over the nitty gritty details with ?", "One thing  weigh very carefully if your mental health is worth this saving.if not find something to rent where you can have a say", "When I mentioned buying a house to my dad he just looked at me and told me that\u2019s never happening lol. \n\nOn a serious note though, I don\u2019t intend to take my financial advice solely from Reddit lmao.", "I was thinking you might have a more local one - ideally, if there was one for the same desk-rental-company local to you, possibly it could be put onto the company account.\n\nI guess you are a way away; if not, also consider a bike or better ebike if it's <10 - 15 miles each way.  Great way to get around for free (charge battery at work), choose a used one carefully and they barely lose value, but you'll need a good lock or a folding bike you can take inside for many areas."]}
