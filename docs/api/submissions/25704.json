So, i [24f] live in a 2 bedroom apartment. I had an extra room, that i wanted to rent out. The new roommate [23f], let\u2019s call her rachel, moved in 5 months ago, she was a friend of a friend. \nOur building is pet friendly, she has a 3 year old chihuahua. I love dogs, so i was okay with her bringing it along. My conditions were that since it is her dog, she will be responsible for feeding, cleaning and he should be potty trained and shouldn\u2019t expect me to do it. We have carpets in the apartment. \n\nThe issue started, her dog was not potty trained at all, he would shit EVERYWHERE. For the first couple of weeks, she kept saying that it\u2019s a new place, he will get used to it so I understand.  Rachel would \u2018try\u2019 to clean it up but wouldn\u2019t do a good job and then i obviously had to, because it would smell. There where days where the dog would behave but somedays lots of accidents and i didn\u2019t see Rachel trying anything to do actively to train him. I told her 2 months in she needs to figure it out or she is out. I suggested we get an indoor dog potty tray. But she wasn\u2019t too keen and said i would take him out often. I got that tray for him, and tried to train him on that but i work long hours and when i am home i just want to rest. Rachel has a remote job so she is at the house.  Our apartment started to smell in different parts and it was exhausting to throughly clean everything. My room was also a no zone and Rachel knew. \n\nMy last straw was, that after an exhausting day. I came home and the dog was in my room and the door was closed. I told Rachel to keep an eye out, she just brushed it off that\u2019s he was only sleeping in there. I stepped into my closet and my barefoot landed straight on the poop. I completely lost it. I yelled at Rachel that she shouldn\u2019t have a dog if she cant take care of it properly, and to give it away to a responsible person. That she needs to pack her stuff and leave. She started crying, i felt bad, but then i smelled the shit again and i was like nope she is out. She took her dog and went to a friends house. Our common friend called me and said that she is hysterical and that i shouldn\u2019t have kicked her out because of the dog. A few of our friends have sided with her as well. So i wanted to know, AITA for kicking her out.\n\nEdit: a lot of people are saying why I hadn\u2019t kicked her out before, well she said that dog helps her with her anxiety, i had confided in my friends about my situation but she would always say it takes her time to adjust to new places and she has had a lot of peace because of the dog.", "created_utc": 1693221649, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163je8h/aita_for_kicking_my_roommate_out_because_her_dog/", "score": 121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Another bad dog owner. Drives me nuts. Some people with small dogs think it\u2019s no big deal if they are not totally potty trained because their messes are \u201csmall\u201d. That is ridiculous, even small messes cause a smell that will grow over time. People get used to the smell and they don\u2019t realize they are living in a home that smells of urine and feces, it\u2019s revolting. Also pew pads were invented for very young puppies and elderly dogs not your purse dog you can\u2019t bother to take outside.", "NTA No, just No! Everyone who thinks you are the asshole is free to offer her, her dog and its shit a room. You were very patient, even offered  solutions, but there must be a limit.

She agreed to your conditions that she was responsible for the dog and then completely ignored them. And her neglect of the dog made life unbearable for you, not to mention making you clean up after her dog\u2019s mess. \n\nIf she were living by herself, it would be one thing, but she wasn\u2019t.

Finally, she *knew* the dog was not allowed in your room, but let it in there anyway, knowing that the dog goes to the bathroom wherever it is. \n\nShe really should not be surprised that she got kicked out. It was not a matter of if, only a matter of when.", "NTA for wanting her gone, but you need to formally evict her, meaning you can't just kick her out.

After one week of shitting indoor I would have baught the dog a doggy diaper and told Rachel, if there is one more shit in the flat, she will be kicked out or animal controll will be called, because she clearly doesn't care about this dog and treats it like a plushy and not a living animale who needs training.", "If the dog isn\u2019t trained at 3 years old its owner is too lazy to do it.
