He basically abandoned my mum and my siblings and I to go to another country to start a new life (under the guise of exploring new business ventures). Nothing came out of these business ventures and he did not send a single cent back to us while he kept asking my mother and myself for money. I'm the eldest daughter in the family, my sister was still in school when my dad left for abroad and my mother is not physically well enough to work, so I basically provided for the family since I was 18. My mum is able to work light jobs now, and my sister also graduated and have started working so we're doing ok. I have a pretty average salary of 50k but there's still plenty of debt to clear.\n\nFor years my mum did give him money, up until last year when she decided to get a divorce. She always gave because it was always for dire situations (eg COVID happened and needed money to help with cashflow, or he got injured in traffic accidents etc) and he always promised it was for the final time. Now that she has completed ignored him, he has been texting and calling me instead. At first I was still really happy that he was texting me because I missed him, he's my dad. But I quickly realised he only texted when he needed money, and I didn't want to respond anymore.\n\nHe texted me again a few days ago to ask for money. He begged and said he was desperate and he was sorry, and that this is the last time he will ever borrow from me. He took pictures of some injuries on his arm that he got from work and said he needs cash to get medical attention. I don't want to give it. I told him I'm left with a thousand in my bank account for the month after bills and paying off his past debts (which my mum and I are still paying because he used our names to register businesses in the past) and he asked for six hundred.\n\nOn one hand I'm really sick of being treated like a cashcow. I've recently learnt from a trustworthy source that he has had a mistress abroad for years now too. I think that's when I realised he's dead to me. For what it's worth, he really was a good father before he left and he worked hard for us and cared about giving us a better life. But that father I knew was long gone. This person isn't him anymore. On another hand, I am worried about him and his safety, and if I don't give him this money he may have no other avenues of help in his life. I have asked my friends and some of them have said if it were them, they would transfer the money because he's injured and he promised it's the last time. The last time I sent him any money at all was also about more than a year ago so it's not like I'm giving him money all the time. \n\nI know if I give him any money now he'll only ask for more again if he needs to. But he's my dad and I can't just let him suffer like this. idk I've been crying about this for the past few days and I can't make up my mind.", "created_utc": 1677745743, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11fxh8f/wibta_if_i_dont_give_my_father_any_money/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And there's a thing called social capital--if he's burned through *all* of it (meaning he has no friends where he is), he's just an AH.

He's invested '0' into your father/daughter relationship; no texts, calls (none $), pics, letters, visits.\n\nHe abandoned you, your $$ carried the family since age 18 (why did he not do this?), he always promised your mom it was 'the last time' & it was not,, he remained married and kept a mistress (form of lying).....you do not mention he has called you to have a relationship. His story and history sounds fishy as hell: Gambling...addiction...drugs, alcohol, mistress money??\n\nIf you must give $ do what social service groups do; what are the bills and pay one directly (i.e. phone).  Only pay one at first and evaluate how this experience was for you: did he state a ton of excuses why the $ needs to go to him, did he loss his shit re: this approach? Did he express gratitude or demand more?  His inability to support you has hindered your ability to thrive.  How much more money are you going to allow him to take?
