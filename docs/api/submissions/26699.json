I am their only child together and it happened when I was relatively young cos dad realised he was gay and they\u2019ve always had a cordial relationship since. My dad has since remarried as has my mom so I have 2 stepdads. It can get confusing so I\u2019ll call them Steve (48) who is my dad\u2019s husband and Mark (47) who is my mom\u2019s husband.\n\nI\u2019ve always split the time between both houses as its a flexible custody agreement. I love both equally but I\u2019ve always preferred my dad\u2019s house cos the room is bigger and because it\u2019s just me there. Mark has 2 sons who are just always there and loud and they make a lot of mess. Not in a malicious way but they\u2019re just annoying teen boys. The house is only 4 bedrooms so they already take up 2 but now, my mom and Mark are taking in Mark\u2019s 2 nieces and a nephew cos his sister died and they want to stay with the family. This means that both Steve\u2019s sons are gonna have to share a room and my mom said it wasn\u2019t ideal but I would have to share too. My mom and Mark said it would only be until they find a bigger house but I know they can\u2019t afford one and I refused. All the kids are younger than me and I don\u2019t wanna share with one. Plus the noise and mess would be multiplied and id have no privacy at all.\n\nI got really annoyed cos my mom was getting upset and said she was trying to make the best of a bad situation and I ended up calling my dad and asked if he could get me. I told him how I felt and after talking about it more with Steve too I decided I don\u2019t wanna live at mom\u2019s anymore because one house with 6 kids isn\u2019t fair. I went back with Steve who calmly told my mom what I wanted and he helped me get all my belongings from there and I\u2019ve been at his and my dad\u2019s since.\n\nMy mom has been calling and texting a lot as has Mark who has been telling me I\u2019m breaking her heart because \u2018she isn\u2019t doing it maliciously, we are trying to help out family who have nowhere else to go.\u2019 I understand that but they don\u2019t have the room and I don\u2019t wanna sacrifice my privacy. I\u2019m really annoyed cos why are they taking in kids they have no room for? My dad is really annoyed with my mom too cos I struggled a lot with Mark\u2019s sons moving in and he thinks she\u2019s putting too much on me. Steve has been really supportive and isn\u2019t badmouthing anyone and thinks I\u2019m justified in my hurt and has been hugging me and stuff a lot since I can\u2019t stop crying.

Your Mum's lack of being realistic is kind of sad too, she knows that they can't afford a bigger house, so the sharing a room would be a long temporary 2 years until you go to college.

I hope your mom comes to realize this and understands your decision.

If there's genuinely not enough room and you wish to maintain your privacy, especially when a bunch of strangers are moving into one of your homes then living with your dad and Steve is the only viable solution.  So long as a relationship is being maintained between yourself and your mum, I don't see the problem.

I'd say, if you can, make some time to talk and spend time with her. If you feel like you can't explain it, maybe write it down or ask your dad or stepdad to help.

You're a teen and don't get it... and you're being very selfish.", "NAH Your mom shouldn't be guilt-tripping you but honestly the situation just sucks all around, so I'd forgive not being perfect here. Tell your mom, it's only temporary until they get the bigger house. If she can't accept that then she already knows what you suspected all along which is that that bigger house is not coming - and in that case she's the AH. However, there might also be some insuarance set aside for the nieces and nephew to provide for accomodation etc, so perhaps that bigger house is realistic.", "A society build on self interest where everything is about me first.

I am their only child together and it happened when I was relatively young cos dad realised he was gay and they\u2019ve always had a cordial relationship since. My dad has since remarried as has my mom so I have 2 stepdads. It can get confusing so I\u2019ll call them Steve (48) who is my dad\u2019s husband and Mark (47) who is my mom\u2019s husband.\n\nI\u2019ve always split the time between both houses as its a flexible custody agreement. I love both equally but I\u2019ve always preferred my dad\u2019s house cos the room is bigger and because it\u2019s just me there. Mark has 2 sons who are just always there and loud and they make a lot of mess. Not in a malicious way but they\u2019re just annoying teen boys. The house is only 4 bedrooms so they already take up 2 but now, my mom and Mark are taking in Mark\u2019s 2 nieces and a nephew cos his sister died and they want to stay with the family. This means that both Steve\u2019s sons are gonna have to share a room and my mom said it wasn\u2019t ideal but I would have to share too. My mom and Mark said it would only be until they find a bigger house but I know they can\u2019t afford one and I refused. All the kids are younger than me and I don\u2019t wanna share with one.\n\nI got really annoyed cos my mom was getting upset and said she was trying to make the best of a bad situation and I ended up calling my dad and asked if he could get me. I told him how I felt and after talking about it more with Steve too I decided I don\u2019t wanna live at mom\u2019s anymore because one house with 6 kids isn\u2019t fair. I went back with Steve who calmly told my mom what I wanted and he helped me get all my belongings from there and I\u2019ve been at my dad\u2019s since.\n\nMy mom has been calling and texting a lot as has Mark who has been telling me I\u2019m breaking her heart because \u2018she isn\u2019t doing it maliciously, we are trying to help out family who have nowhere else to go.\u2019 I understand that but they don\u2019t have the room and I don\u2019t wanna sacrifice my privacy. I\u2019m really annoyed cos why are they taking in kids they have no room for? My dad is really annoyed with my mom too cos I struggled a lot with Mark\u2019s sons moving in and he thinks she\u2019s putting too much on me. Steve has been really supportive and isn\u2019t badmouthing anyone and thinks I\u2019m justified in my hurt and has been hugging me and stuff a lot since I can\u2019t stop crying.

You're allowed to choose. So is your mother. She didn't have to take in her husband's niblings, she could have truthfully said there was no room. She made her choice, and so did you.

Only child of early divorce here too - both parents involved and generally wonderful (I scored good in the parent department)\n\nAt 14 I decided I wanted to live with my dad. Just because I never had and it felt right at the time, my step situation wasn't ideal but nothing like yours, just jerky older brothers. My mum was devastated but was an adult and handled herself. 18 months later, I'd moved back in with mum when her living situation changed. Dad was sad but again, was an adult and handled himself.\n\nDo you see my point here? You are privileged to have an option and you are excercising this. Your mum and step dad are doing a great thing but you aren't required to also do said great thing if you don't want to, let alone because you're uncomfortable with what that changes for you. \n\nYour mum is understandably sad but using it to emotionally blackmail you into making sacrifices you're uncomfortable with? That is not ok. It sounds like dad and Steve are a great support to you and I'm so glad you have them at your back. It will be ok, mum is making choices and so are you but she is the adult in this relationship and you are not responsible for her feelings. She should however, take a moment to think on how her choices are going to impact your relationship long term. \n\nGood luck OP", "NTA. While your mom and Mark aren\u2019t doing it maliciously, this isn\u2019t an easy situation and you moving out actually helps them until they can move into this bigger house they claim they plan to do.\n\nAlso, how are they planning to split you guys up into the rooms?

You're also 16, nearly an adult now and soon will be off doing your own thing. I get it your mum misses you as you do her deep down no doubt but what she is doing isn't okay. Why aren't the kids with their father?\n\nIf I was you I'd ask if you could go to therapy, I really think it would help you alot and to talk to someone outside of the situation who can help you process everything. Because eventually this will just get you more and more down. Remind your mum you love her but you need space and you need her to respect your decision. You're a young woman now and rightly so need your own space. She'll settle over time I'm sure.", "NTA.  You aren't doing it maliciously either.

Everybody needs a comfortable place to sleep. You solved it for her. Tell mom that right now you know she has her plate full. What day of the week would she prefer to have family dinner and is there a night in the week that you could hang one on one with her? For a walk, do errands, get a coffee. There are lots of ways to maintain a relationship with a parent that doesn\u2019t involve living together.", "NTA \nWanting your own space and privacy is completely understandable. I\u2019m sure at some level this is something your mother understands as well. However, given the tumultuous change Mark and your mother are undergoing - to take in more kids when they\u2019re not in a position to get a bigger place might have overtaken their thought process.  \nGive it time, there\u2019s nothing wrong in your wanting to stay with you father and you did not make this decision with the intention to hurt your mother. \nThis is something your mother will have to realise and understand, which might take her some time to come to terms with. \nWhen such seemingly drastic steps are taken by our loved ones, we tend to assume the worst of the situation and focus on ourselves and how their decisions impact us. Instead of realising that you took the call because of the situation, you mom is just focused on her hurt right now. \nWhat\u2019s important is that you reassure her that this is not the case and make time to interact with her a little more frequently - so she realises that this is not you pulling away, but simply a question of logistics. \nDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ve done absolutely nothing wrong!", "NTA. Your mom and Mark ought to be okay with this arrangement because they will have more room for everybody. Staying with Dad doesn't mean you don't want to spend time with mom. This is not an all or nothing situation.", "NTA- there\u2019s nothing malicious about it and while Mark does not agree with your decision, it\u2019s not fair for him to tell you that you\u2019re breaking your mothers heart. That\u2019s pretty manipulative. Obviously your mother was a fair for you to stay with her, but she went from having one child to taking care of six. You did not sign up for that. Obviously, they did not plan on the sister-in-law passing away, but you\u2019ve got an amazing alternative. Your mother and her husband chose to blend the families. They chose to take in three additional children. At 16, you get to choose how you want to live your life as well. I\u2019m really happy for you that your dads are taking you in full-time.

Where has she considered your needs in this scenario? She is asking you to make a sacrifice on behalf of another adult. How is she protecting you in this scenario? She is cutting in to the resources she has to provide for you financially and emotionally. She is asking you to sacrifice the time and attention she has for you on behalf of three additional children that she chose to take in. \n\nIn addition, she is now asking you to sacrifice for her emotional wants. Emotional support flows one way in a parent/child relationship - from the parent to the child. She is not presenting a logical reason for you to continue to live in her home. It\u2019s not as if you told her you were going no contact. Her behavior in this scenario is emotionally manipulative. She is making what I imagine was a difficult choice for you even more difficult. Has she even asked how you are feeling about all of this change?", "NTA\n\nYou are a kid and imo could not be the asshole for choosing where to live.\n\nThat said your logic is very reasonable and really understandable. You don't seem confused, impulsive, and seem quite mature with the compassion and understanding shown to your mom and her decisions.\n\nChoosing the best environment for yourself is important, and while you're a kid could not be selfish. Imagine how your relationship would sour if you stayed with your mom, not because you wanted to, but out of a sense of obligation. Right now it is critically important you can focus on your future, have a quiet place to study, peace of mind to consider the different options of life. It seems to me you are making the right choice and your mom will understand that in time. Right now I imagine she feels quite guilty about forcing you out by bringing in so many people, and is trying to put that guilt on to you to make herself feel better. Again in time I imagine she sees the error of her ways. Good luck!", "NTA\n\nYou are giving them more room, and taking care of yourself.

You're a kid, so don't stress yourself over adult problems. Just focus on doing what's best for you right now.
