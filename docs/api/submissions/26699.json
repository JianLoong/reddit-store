I am their only child together and it happened when I was relatively young cos dad realised he was gay and they\u2019ve always had a cordial relationship since. My dad has since remarried as has my mom so I have 2 stepdads. It can get confusing so I\u2019ll call them Steve (48) who is my dad\u2019s husband and Mark (47) who is my mom\u2019s husband.\n\nI\u2019ve always split the time between both houses as its a flexible custody agreement. I love both equally but I\u2019ve always preferred my dad\u2019s house cos the room is bigger and because it\u2019s just me there. Mark has 2 sons who are just always there and loud and they make a lot of mess. Not in a malicious way but they\u2019re just annoying teen boys. The house is only 4 bedrooms so they already take up 2 but now, my mom and Mark are taking in Mark\u2019s 2 nieces and a nephew cos his sister died and they want to stay with the family. This means that both Steve\u2019s sons are gonna have to share a room and my mom said it wasn\u2019t ideal but I would have to share too. My mom and Mark said it would only be until they find a bigger house but I know they can\u2019t afford one and I refused. All the kids are younger than me and I don\u2019t wanna share with one. Plus the noise and mess would be multiplied and id have no privacy at all.\n\nI got really annoyed cos my mom was getting upset and said she was trying to make the best of a bad situation and I ended up calling my dad and asked if he could get me. I told him how I felt and after talking about it more with Steve too I decided I don\u2019t wanna live at mom\u2019s anymore because one house with 6 kids isn\u2019t fair. I went back with Steve who calmly told my mom what I wanted and he helped me get all my belongings from there and I\u2019ve been at his and my dad\u2019s since.\n\nMy mom has been calling and texting a lot as has Mark who has been telling me I\u2019m breaking her heart because \u2018she isn\u2019t doing it maliciously, we are trying to help out family who have nowhere else to go.\u2019 I understand that but they don\u2019t have the room and I don\u2019t wanna sacrifice my privacy. I\u2019m really annoyed cos why are they taking in kids they have no room for? My dad is really annoyed with my mom too cos I struggled a lot with Mark\u2019s sons moving in and he thinks she\u2019s putting too much on me. Steve has been really supportive and isn\u2019t badmouthing anyone and thinks I\u2019m justified in my hurt and has been hugging me and stuff a lot since I can\u2019t stop crying.

Your Mum's lack of being realistic is kind of sad too, she knows that they can't afford a bigger house, so the sharing a room would be a long temporary 2 years until you go to college.

I hope your mom comes to realize this and understands your decision.

If there's genuinely not enough room and you wish to maintain your privacy, especially when a bunch of strangers are moving into one of your homes then living with your dad and Steve is the only viable solution.  So long as a relationship is being maintained between yourself and your mum, I don't see the problem.

I'd say, if you can, make some time to talk and spend time with her. If you feel like you can't explain it, maybe write it down or ask your dad or stepdad to help.

You're a teen and don't get it... and you're being very selfish.", "NAH Your mom shouldn't be guilt-tripping you but honestly the situation just sucks all around, so I'd forgive not being perfect here. Tell your mom, it's only temporary until they get the bigger house. If she can't accept that then she already knows what you suspected all along which is that that bigger house is not coming - and in that case she's the AH. However, there might also be some insuarance set aside for the nieces and nephew to provide for accomodation etc, so perhaps that bigger house is realistic.", "A society build on self interest where everything is about me first.

I am their only child together and it happened when I was relatively young cos dad realised he was gay and they\u2019ve always had a cordial relationship since. My dad has since remarried as has my mom so I have 2 stepdads. It can get confusing so I\u2019ll call them Steve (48) who is my dad\u2019s husband and Mark (47) who is my mom\u2019s husband.\n\nI\u2019ve always split the time between both houses as its a flexible custody agreement. I love both equally but I\u2019ve always preferred my dad\u2019s house cos the room is bigger and because it\u2019s just me there. Mark has 2 sons who are just always there and loud and they make a lot of mess. Not in a malicious way but they\u2019re just annoying teen boys. The house is only 4 bedrooms so they already take up 2 but now, my mom and Mark are taking in Mark\u2019s 2 nieces and a nephew cos his sister died and they want to stay with the family. This means that both Steve\u2019s sons are gonna have to share a room and my mom said it wasn\u2019t ideal but I would have to share too. My mom and Mark said it would only be until they find a bigger house but I know they can\u2019t afford one and I refused. All the kids are younger than me and I don\u2019t wanna share with one.\n\nI got really annoyed cos my mom was getting upset and said she was trying to make the best of a bad situation and I ended up calling my dad and asked if he could get me. I told him how I felt and after talking about it more with Steve too I decided I don\u2019t wanna live at mom\u2019s anymore because one house with 6 kids isn\u2019t fair. I went back with Steve who calmly told my mom what I wanted and he helped me get all my belongings from there and I\u2019ve been at my dad\u2019s since.\n\nMy mom has been calling and texting a lot as has Mark who has been telling me I\u2019m breaking her heart because \u2018she isn\u2019t doing it maliciously, we are trying to help out family who have nowhere else to go.\u2019 I understand that but they don\u2019t have the room and I don\u2019t wanna sacrifice my privacy. I\u2019m really annoyed cos why are they taking in kids they have no room for? My dad is really annoyed with my mom too cos I struggled a lot with Mark\u2019s sons moving in and he thinks she\u2019s putting too much on me. Steve has been really supportive and isn\u2019t badmouthing anyone and thinks I\u2019m justified in my hurt and has been hugging me and stuff a lot since I can\u2019t stop crying.

You're allowed to choose. So is your mother. She didn't have to take in her husband's niblings, she could have truthfully said there was no room. She made her choice, and so did you.

Only child of early divorce here too - both parents involved and generally wonderful (I scored good in the parent department)\n\nAt 14 I decided I wanted to live with my dad. Just because I never had and it felt right at the time, my step situation wasn't ideal but nothing like yours, just jerky older brothers. My mum was devastated but was an adult and handled herself. 18 months later, I'd moved back in with mum when her living situation changed. Dad was sad but again, was an adult and handled himself.\n\nDo you see my point here? You are privileged to have an option and you are excercising this. Your mum and step dad are doing a great thing but you aren't required to also do said great thing if you don't want to, let alone because you're uncomfortable with what that changes for you. \n\nYour mum is understandably sad but using it to emotionally blackmail you into making sacrifices you're uncomfortable with? That is not ok. It sounds like dad and Steve are a great support to you and I'm so glad you have them at your back. It will be ok, mum is making choices and so are you but she is the adult in this relationship and you are not responsible for her feelings. She should however, take a moment to think on how her choices are going to impact your relationship long term. \n\nGood luck OP", "NTA. While your mom and Mark aren\u2019t doing it maliciously, this isn\u2019t an easy situation and you moving out actually helps them until they can move into this bigger house they claim they plan to do.\n\nAlso, how are they planning to split you guys up into the rooms?

You're also 16, nearly an adult now and soon will be off doing your own thing. I get it your mum misses you as you do her deep down no doubt but what she is doing isn't okay. Why aren't the kids with their father?\n\nIf I was you I'd ask if you could go to therapy, I really think it would help you alot and to talk to someone outside of the situation who can help you process everything. Because eventually this will just get you more and more down. Remind your mum you love her but you need space and you need her to respect your decision. You're a young woman now and rightly so need your own space. She'll settle over time I'm sure.", "NTA.  You aren't doing it maliciously either.

Everybody needs a comfortable place to sleep. You solved it for her. Tell mom that right now you know she has her plate full. What day of the week would she prefer to have family dinner and is there a night in the week that you could hang one on one with her? For a walk, do errands, get a coffee. There are lots of ways to maintain a relationship with a parent that doesn\u2019t involve living together.", "NTA \nWanting your own space and privacy is completely understandable. I\u2019m sure at some level this is something your mother understands as well. However, given the tumultuous change Mark and your mother are undergoing - to take in more kids when they\u2019re not in a position to get a bigger place might have overtaken their thought process.  \nGive it time, there\u2019s nothing wrong in your wanting to stay with you father and you did not make this decision with the intention to hurt your mother. \nThis is something your mother will have to realise and understand, which might take her some time to come to terms with. \nWhen such seemingly drastic steps are taken by our loved ones, we tend to assume the worst of the situation and focus on ourselves and how their decisions impact us. Instead of realising that you took the call because of the situation, you mom is just focused on her hurt right now. \nWhat\u2019s important is that you reassure her that this is not the case and make time to interact with her a little more frequently - so she realises that this is not you pulling away, but simply a question of logistics. \nDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ve done absolutely nothing wrong!", "NTA. Your mom and Mark ought to be okay with this arrangement because they will have more room for everybody. Staying with Dad doesn't mean you don't want to spend time with mom. This is not an all or nothing situation.", "NTA- there\u2019s nothing malicious about it and while Mark does not agree with your decision, it\u2019s not fair for him to tell you that you\u2019re breaking your mothers heart. That\u2019s pretty manipulative. Obviously your mother was a fair for you to stay with her, but she went from having one child to taking care of six. You did not sign up for that. Obviously, they did not plan on the sister-in-law passing away, but you\u2019ve got an amazing alternative. Your mother and her husband chose to blend the families. They chose to take in three additional children. At 16, you get to choose how you want to live your life as well. I\u2019m really happy for you that your dads are taking you in full-time.

Where has she considered your needs in this scenario? She is asking you to make a sacrifice on behalf of another adult. How is she protecting you in this scenario? She is cutting in to the resources she has to provide for you financially and emotionally. She is asking you to sacrifice the time and attention she has for you on behalf of three additional children that she chose to take in. \n\nIn addition, she is now asking you to sacrifice for her emotional wants. Emotional support flows one way in a parent/child relationship - from the parent to the child. She is not presenting a logical reason for you to continue to live in her home. It\u2019s not as if you told her you were going no contact. Her behavior in this scenario is emotionally manipulative. She is making what I imagine was a difficult choice for you even more difficult. Has she even asked how you are feeling about all of this change?", "NTA\n\nYou are a kid and imo could not be the asshole for choosing where to live.\n\nThat said your logic is very reasonable and really understandable. You don't seem confused, impulsive, and seem quite mature with the compassion and understanding shown to your mom and her decisions.\n\nChoosing the best environment for yourself is important, and while you're a kid could not be selfish. Imagine how your relationship would sour if you stayed with your mom, not because you wanted to, but out of a sense of obligation. Right now it is critically important you can focus on your future, have a quiet place to study, peace of mind to consider the different options of life. It seems to me you are making the right choice and your mom will understand that in time. Right now I imagine she feels quite guilty about forcing you out by bringing in so many people, and is trying to put that guilt on to you to make herself feel better. Again in time I imagine she sees the error of her ways. Good luck!", "NTA\n\nYou are giving them more room, and taking care of yourself.

You're a kid, so don't stress yourself over adult problems. Just focus on doing what's best for you right now.

I wouldn't want to live with that many other kids either, and it sounds like your parents don't live that far apart.\n\nYou'll be driving soon. Just reassure your mom that you will still visit, you just don't want to live in a house that's that overcrowded.", "NTA. I suspect they expected you to help parent the kids and that\u2019s what is really disappointing your mum. Because it makes sense to move if they don\u2019t have space and you\u2019re old enough. \n\nTell your mum you will still pop over for a short visit.", "This is sad, because no one here is doing this to be mean, it's just the way it is. You sound very mature and you have a very good reason for wanting more space.\n\nHonestly I'd have a talk with your mom, let her know you love her so much but right now, at 16, you *need* to have a less chaotic environment so you can focus on school and your life and not always be on edge because of the extra noise and presence. You grew up as an only child, you are accustomed to having a measure of peace that you just can't get in her home anymore. Offer to spend the occasional night, or meet up with her for mom-daughter dates at a diner or shopping or something. Tell her you'll keep her in the loop in your life and you'd be really happy for those chances to have quality time with her all to yourself. \n\nAnd then ask her, if she was your age and had the choice between a big, calm, private space of her own while growing up.....or a cramped lack of privacy surrounded by the hectic noises and mess of an extended blended family that she didn't even know very well.... which choice would she have made for herself? Would she throw away the opportunity for the better environment for herself just to spare her mother's feelings? And can she really live with herself as a mother if she puts that pressure on you to make a worse choice for yourself? She needs to realize that your relationship with her will be far better if she gives you her love and lets you go now, before frustration with your living arrangement becomes resentment. \n\nMake it clear. **You are going to go to live with your dad. That's what's best for you *and even for the household you're leaving behind*, because with you gone they have a little more room themselves, too.**\n\nHer choice is to EITHER: let you go with her love, grace, and blessing, and to continue to keep your mother daughter relationship alive through talking on the phone, over zoom calls and such, and spending short day trips together to catch up on things...... \n\nOR: Keep putting the guilt and responsibility of *her feelings* on you as the child, and have this move away from her start on the kind of sour note that can harm your relationship forever. She needs to act like a mother and support what's best for you, even if that hurts, because you aren't doing this TO her, you're doing it FOR you. \n\nAlso..... If you want to use notes from anything that I wrote here, you have my blessing. I'm a sociologist working towards counseling credits and one of the focal points of my education and drive is finding ways to clearly articulate conflicts to make communication more effective.", "NAH.\n\nIt's a sad situation but your mom and step dad are doing right by taking in orphaned family members. It's understandable if you want to move to your dad's so you should go do that.", "NAH you\u2019re mum is being incredibly kind to take on family who may otherwise end up in foster care. She is doing an amazing thing and she is acknowledging it\u2019s not ideal for you.\n\nI get why you wouldn\u2019t want to share a room either. Totally understandable.\n\nYour mum probably feels like she can\u2019t win. She probably feels like she\u2019s losing her only daughter and all because she is trying to do the right thing. No one should be giving her shit for trying to keep kids out foster care.\n\nAre you planning to have any time with her going forward ?", "NAH \n\nNot every one can deal with so many kids, and expecting you to do that is not fair.\n\nAlso your mom & stepdad are in a tough situation to care for those kids. Which is a very tough thing to do btw. It\u2019s not easy to just take care of extra kids which will chen age their whole lives and add on so much of responsibility. \n\nAnd to lose her own bio daughter from living with her bcoz she\u2019s forced to take care of others kids must not be easy for your mom. I think that\u2019s where her hurt is come from.\n\nI feel for them. But I feel for you too. Both of you are not wrong here.

At 16, you should know the alternatives would be MUCH worse than living with family, so in that you were the AH.   \nAlso in saying that, there's nothing wrong about wanting privacy or to be comfortable -but- there's also nothing wrong with a little bit of sacrifice for your family. More so when that sacrifice is only sharing a room part time. It really sounds like most of the issues came from how your dad approached the situation, making what would look like a unilateral decision without the others. Ultimately, I'd say NAH, but your dad or steve could've easily handled it far better by having a simple conversation than by blindsiding your mum and Mark by just showing up and telling everyone what's going to happen.", "NAH\n\nI can see why you wouldn't want to give up your space and privacy, especially to younger kids. I can also imagine the amount of noise that all these children will make and that you desire peace and quiet in your home. \n\nYour mother and Mark have not done anything wrong. It's a very tragic situation and they are doing their best to handle it in the least difficult way for themselves and all children, including you I'm sure. Three bedrooms for six kids is definitely not the worst I've seen. Yeah, suddenly having to share stinks, for everyone, but plenty of college dorms are closets with two people and no separate kitchen or den so I can't call the setup you and the other kids are facing cruel or intolerable on the face of it. I get that it's not at all what you want, but it's hardly neglect.\n\nMark just lost his sister, which I'm sure hurts. Social services does prefer to home surviving children with blood relatives, because the other option is that his nieces and nephew will be split up and go to different foster homes. That would be awful and traumatic. He might be eligible for a stipend for their care, so a larger home may be something he and your mom could realize and not just idle talk. He's doing his best with a terrible situation and I hope you're being nice to him because what he's dealing with is heartbreaking. \n\nAs for your mom, she just loves you and wants you around. Parents can ve possessive, especially with teens who are realizing more independence, and *especially* when divorce is involved; they feel like they are in competition for their child's love, attention, and respect, plus they don't want to feel like they have the less-desirable home. That makes them feel inadequate. Your mom also is being a good, supportive wife to Mark in his time of need, as well as being maternal toward children who desperately need help and compassion right now. \n\nEveryone is doing what they can. Hopefully you have been respectful in all this and haven't complained too much too loudly about losing your space, because let's face it: that's not that serious compared to a man mourning his sister or children without a family of their own anymore. You're lucky enough to have an out and I agree that it is best for you to take it. Just be as kind as you can, reassure your mom that it's not her, it's you, and maybe give a gentle reminder that this means more space for the little girls as well.", "NAH\n\nYou are doing the right thing. You mum's house has no room for you. She loves you, and so she wants to squeeze you in; but she is being selfish in her love. You need space.\n\nDon't feel bad.

And you can always go visit your mum.", "Nah", "NTA, tell you Mom and Mark you are not doing this maliciously you are just staying at the home you feel most comfortable. You Mom and Mark must understand you are not doing anything wrong. You Mom wants you to push the way you feel aside but she is not doing the same.

Space wise, there is more room at your moms house for everyone, and at your dad's you get your own room. You will also be the only child there, so you get the full attention of your parents there instead of having to share it. You mom and steve get to focus on more on the kids who lost their parents, which they will need the extra attention. \n\nFinancially, you are also helping out your mom, as you are decreasing the amount she has to spend on food by you not being there. \n\nThey down side for you mom is that you will not be sleeping there anymore, but that doesn't mean you wont visit your mom or spend time with her. Assure her you are not disappering from her life, just changing where you go to sleep. \n\nAs for youself, you should never feel bad about putting your own well being first.

Since my mom died I WISH I could go back in time and be more considerate of her feelings. \n\nYou are entitled to make whatever decision you want but remember these kids lost their parent and your mom is just trying to do a selfless act to help them. You moving out entirely WILL break her heart. \n\nHave you considered a compromise of just spending less time there? Are you even sure they can\u2019t afford a bigger house? It\u2019s possible there may be an inheritance for the kids that might affect that, or state assistance for fostering.\n\nETA: I have personally experienced this as a kid my parents briefly took in my cousin and his two baby daughters after his wife died. The fit I pitched as a jealous only child can only be seen now as one of my most embarrassing moments. In my defense I was much younger than OP. So yeah, I get it, you\u2019re still a child, but old enough to think things through and recognize there are other people involved here.

They didn't do this to hurt you.  They did this because it's the right thing to do.\n\nI understand the privacy thing.  16-year-old girls want that, but by totally moving out and not having your own space carved out there, you are going to miss out on something really special.

Your step father is trying to keep the kids together and offer them some semblance of comfort and warmth. Realizing you have a way to make the situation easier on everyone, yourself included, and taking it, is fine. But you should really try to empathize with the kids who just lost their parent, and the brother who just lost his sister.  \n\nAnd when you talk to your mother, try emphasizing that this is better for everyone and should make it easier for all.

She moved two kids into her house for her husband.  And now moving two more in for him.  And this is making her daughter feel squeezed out.  She\u2019s telling herself it\u2019s just till we find a bigger place, but she knows daughter will be gone to college before they can afford it.  So daughter says I want to live with my dad and Mom is feeling like she failed or \u201cchose a man\u201d over her own child.  Major guilt there and if her husband really loves her, he\u2019s going to feel guilty that his decisions are hurting his wife as well.\n\nWanting your own space at 16 is NTA material, especially when you haven\u2019t had to share a room.  Trying to make you feel guilty for that to assuage their own guilt is a major AH maneuver.  It\u2019s emotional manipulation, and thats wrong to do to anyone, especially a child.\n\nI understand why they took in the other kids.  Foster care horror stories abound, and this is a way that these kids who lost their parents will have a safe haven.  It does NOT mean your mom wants to replace you.  But their decisions have consequences, and one of those is that you don\u2019t want to be crowded or have the responsibility of being \u201cthe oldest\u201d.  That\u2019s ok too.  I suggest you, her and Dad have a sit down (no other kids or step parents) and lay out the ground rules with visits and emotional rules.  You want to visit mom but no emotional blackmail is allowed.  You\u2019ll visit, but not as a babysitter.  Child support is not your business and they need to handle that between themselves.  But get the rules laid out so that you feel comfortable and safe, and then they have to enforce that with their spouses.", "NTA.

I can understand why your Mum and her partner are taking in the nieces and nephews. I can understand that your mum still wants you to live with her some of the time because she loves you.\n\nBut at the end of the day, your Mum knew you struggled with her partners sons moving in. She knows you like quiet and privacy. And she knows there\u2019s a perfectly good, safe, happy home available for you (relatively locally from the sounds of things) where you can be happier, and less stressed. It doesn\u2019t have to mean you don\u2019t see your mum. It just means you won\u2019t live with her for the forseeable. Moreover, if she really is determined she\u2019ll find somewhere bigger, the situation can change again when they\u2019re in a bigger house.\n\nTo be honest, up until the guilting from your mum and her partner, I would have said no one was the asshole, but your Mum\u2019s reaction puts her in the AH territory. Sadly, just because it\u2019s the \u2018right\u2019 choice for the most people, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the best for everyone. For Mark\u2019s sons, it\u2019s okay because they only have one home, and it\u2019s their cousins who are moving in. For the cousins, it\u2019s better than them potentially being split up or doing foster care. For Mark, it\u2019s his siblings kids. But for you, it\u2019s an unhappy and stressful home when you have an alternative. And that means your Mum is going to have to suffer somewhat as well.

She passed and left three kids.  One in college, the other two much younger.  And instantly, after just getting my own room, I had a roommate I knew nothing about, was high maintenance and didn\u2019t know boundaries.  My sister also had a roommate but was luckier that that cousin was better mannered and adapted better.\n\nI don\u2019t blame my parents for taking the kids in, but it did create tremendous upset in the house.  My school grades tanked and I enlisted in the military before graduating HS just to get out of there.  The suddenness and shock to discover family we didn\u2019t know existed contributed to the challenges.  It turned out that Aunt was an alcoholic and had been for many, many years.  The children\u2019s dad was also an alcoholic and had passed several years earlier.\n\nAll of that is to say, I have some idea about the angst you are facing.  Your mom may not be looking at the bigger picture and feels only the hurt that you don\u2019t intended.  She also is being asked to take on a lot and doesn\u2019t want to lose you in the process.\n\nI think you need to sit down with your mom and discuss all of this.  That you plan to stay with your dad because it\u2019s in your best interest but you want to make sure you don\u2019t lose your connection with her.  Be clear that you are not rejecting her but you have an option and by you living with your dad, there is a little more space in the house for everyone else.\n\nMake plans for you and her to have time together.

Or do the nieces share and you have not only a roommate but a male one at that? \n\nEither way NTA. Neither of those living situations is sustainable. You had another option. The only reasonable thing to do was take it. But do try to make it clear to your Mother that your actions were based in logic and trying to make the best situation for everyone. By moving to your Dad's you free up a room and allow them the space to better help Mark's nieces and nephew. \n\nBecause if you are correct in your assessment of their ability to buy a larger house then \"we'll get a new place\" would have soon turned into \"you'll be at college in just a few years, you can put up with it until then right?\" But there is no need to put up with anything.

Some may criticize your Mom and Mark for taking in these children, but if these kids really don't have anywhere else to go familywise then they would end up in the foster care system.  As a parent and an aunt I don't think I would be able to let that happen to my sister's kids and I would hope if something happened to me my family wouldn't let my son end up in foster system.

Steve is amazing and I love parents like this. He is exactly right. You're not the asshole.", "NTA. This will lead to you having to watch the kids too.", "I'm going to infer some things from word choice and context. I'm not saying this is fact, just that these are my assumptions based on what you wrote and how you wrote it. I'm sorry about the length, but I am concerned for you and I have some of my own experience in a similar situation.\n\n\u2611\ufe0fYou are someone that not only enjoys privacy, but needs it to regroup and refresh in order to face the day. It doesn't mean you don't like people, but even at your dad's with only 3 of you, you still seek the comfort of your own space. I am exactly this way and if I don't get time alone it's incredibly stressful and taxing on my mental health.\n\n\u2611\ufe0fTeens can be messy, not just boys. What worries me about the way you wrote this is Mark's boys aren't expected to pick up after themselves and either you're stuck living in a mess because your mom and Mark can't keep up or you're expected to help pick up after them too. There's something called [eldest daughter syndrome](https://theconversation.com/what-is-eldest-daughter-syndrome-and-how-can-we-fix-it-202016). I'm not entirely assuming that is what is happening here, but I'm definitely suspicious. Now, only you know if this is going on or not, but it can be happening and not be as extreme as it is in other families. \n\n\u2611\ufe0fTaking in an extra 3 children is a huge decision that should have been discussed with you before it was already a done deal. No one wants 3 kids who just lost their mom to suffer or be split apart, but it's also not okay to force a situation on another child because of it. In fact, your mom should have discussed this with your dad and Steve ahead of time too, and she *should* have said she wants you with her always, but for your comfort, if you're okay with it, you would stay with your dad exclusively until they could figure out bigger accommodations. That she doesn't want you to feel pushed out but she feels like she needs to help these 3 kids and she hopes you understand. Unfortunately, that didn't happen, and you had to make the decision for yourself.\n\n\u2611\ufe0fYou know your family, I don't. But I don't see them buying a bigger house with you potentially heading off to college in 2 years and Mark's sons soon after that. Especially if you believe they don't have the money. I fear that the hope was that you'd just deal for those 2 years until you left home. If there are 4 bedrooms, and 3 boys and 3 girls, that's 3 bedrooms to split across 2 sexes. I don't know how they were going to make that work.\n\n\u2611\ufe0fYour mom should have backed off after you said you wanted to stay with your dad. The constant texting will only either drive you away or unfairly manipulate you to give in. Your stepdad Mark is WAY out of line though. This is part of the reason I am thinking that there actually was an expectation for you to help out and they need your free labor. I don't understand his choice in saying that to you unless he has some ulterior motive for you to come back.\n\n\u2611\ufe0fYou also said that the addition of Mark's sons was stressful for you and your dad was still upset about that. This is another clue for me that you might be expected to do things around the house that the boys aren't. \n\nI'm going to say NTA, instead of N-A-H, because you did nothing wrong and even if your mom and stepdad aren't expecting free childcare, etc, from you, this was not handled correctly by them. If this is simply a case of your mom wants you around and is sad at the thought of you not being there (which is what I hope is going on), then I suggest you have a family meeting with her and your dad, say that you love her and don't want to hurt her, but you need your personal space in order to function and be healthy. Suggest visiting her for a mom/daughter slumber party weekend every couple of weeks, you both can camp out in the living room and bond, or something that you both enjoy doing together. Tell her that it's only temporary, until she and Mark move into a bigger house. Because if that's really happening, her discomfort of not having you around should never trump your discomfort of being made to give up your space. That's the burden she decided to take on, and it's not up to you to absorb that, especially if you have another place to go that's safe and accommodating.\n\nI hope you update us, maybe clarify some things a lot of people are arguing about in the comments. You're still NTA, but just how much the others are at fault really depends on some more specific information. Take care of yourself, sweetheart.
