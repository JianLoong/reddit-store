I met him and he was a good, honest fellow.\n\nAnyways here was the problem, my cousin(her mom) caught wind of this and was absolutely furious, grounding her and keeping trackers on her. For heads up I do not have a good relationship with my cousin but we have kept it civil. She was the typical snobby church mom who thinks that everything about her daughter has to be perfect. Anyways, this morning I found my niece camping in my apartment lobby. Apparently ever since my cousin found out, she has frequently been waking my niece up at 5am screaming at her in the name of educating her about sex and the dangers of it. My poor niece is visibly in a really bad shape right now. She\u2019s already two grades ahead with tons of AP equivalent classes here. She also has a bunch of activities outside of her school she has to keep up with. My cousin also removed the locks to my niece's room so my niece can\u2019t even get a good night's rest cause she's terrified.\n\nI\u2019m currently taking care of her and her mom demanded that I return her child. My girlfriend doesn't mind my niece living with us and has been accommodating to her but my whole extended family has been pressuring me to return my niece. \n\nMy niece also said she would go back but I really can\u2019t tell if it was because she\u2019s afraid of her mom or she really wants to go home. So WIBTA for continue to force my niece to stay with me?\n\nEdit: oh yes I'm looking into cps. I'm just afraid that they send my niece into foster care.\n\nEdit: so basically like alot of people said that while CPS can still look into this, she is \"emancipated\"(that's not the term my friend used here but basically it means she can consent to where she wants to live in) meaning that unless my niece specifically stand against me in court saying I kidnapped her, I'm not actually in any legal issues. And I've contacted her dad(fyi his not with my cousin anymore). Who will be flying in from outside of the country to settle this.\n\nAlso yeah my first response was a bit stupid but I guarantee you it was in good faith.
