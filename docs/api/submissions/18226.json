I met him and he was a good, honest fellow.\n\nAnyways here was the problem, my cousin(her mom) caught wind of this and was absolutely furious, grounding her and keeping trackers on her. For heads up I do not have a good relationship with my cousin but we have kept it civil. She was the typical snobby church mom who thinks that everything about her daughter has to be perfect. Anyways, this morning I found my niece camping in my apartment lobby. Apparently ever since my cousin found out, she has frequently been waking my niece up at 5am screaming at her in the name of educating her about sex and the dangers of it. My poor niece is visibly in a really bad shape right now. She\u2019s already two grades ahead with tons of AP equivalent classes here. She also has a bunch of activities outside of her school she has to keep up with. My cousin also removed the locks to my niece's room so my niece can\u2019t even get a good night's rest cause she's terrified.\n\nI\u2019m currently taking care of her and her mom demanded that I return her child. My girlfriend doesn't mind my niece living with us and has been accommodating to her but my whole extended family has been pressuring me to return my niece. \n\nMy niece also said she would go back but I really can\u2019t tell if it was because she\u2019s afraid of her mom or she really wants to go home. So WIBTA for continue to force my niece to stay with me?\n\nEdit: oh yes I'm looking into cps. I'm just afraid that they send my niece into foster care.\n\nEdit: so basically like alot of people said that while CPS can still look into this, she is \"emancipated\"(that's not the term my friend used here but basically it means she can consent to where she wants to live in) meaning that unless my niece specifically stand against me in court saying I kidnapped her, I'm not actually in any legal issues. And I've contacted her dad(fyi his not with my cousin anymore). Who will be flying in from outside of the country to settle this.\n\nAlso yeah my first response was a bit stupid but I guarantee you it was in good faith.

They are supporting an abuser because it's easier to placate the crazy than stand up to it. \n\nI'm glad that her father is coming to help her. I do not trust your cousin. I'm worried that she'll get physically violent and cut off your niece's ability to communicate with the outside world. I'm even worried that she might send your niece to one of those torture camps/schools for \"troubled teens\" or to some kind of abusive religious indoctrination camp. Those exist and they ruin kids lives.", "That's child abuse right there", "*uncle, OP is male.", "I'm in the United States (New Jersey) \n\nWhen I was fifteen and a half, CPS took my younger brother and sister (with whom I did not live; our parents were separated and both were found unfit) who were ten and eleven and put them in foster care but allowed me to stay with a friend's family.\n\nI was allowed to return home at sixteen, despite both my parents being severe, active alcoholics.", "Also in some places as young as 14 can emancipate.", "Was that in the US?", "I think a lot of people aren't understanding the the very real legal issues.  I know in my state minor children (even teenagers) don't get to unilaterally decide where they want to live.  Their parent(s) or legal guardian(s) have to be in agreement, guardianship in the new home determined, etc.", "Yes and at her age a judge will more than likely let her decide where she lives.", "Entirely dependent on country and state. NZ is 16, pretty sure UK is aswell.", "Universally yes. However, locally is different everywhere.", "If he's worried for her physical safety he has a duty to keep her safe, and I think he would be right to be worried at this point.", "Lol he's forcing her to stay away from her abusive mother? Get real", "Her mother is unhinged. This is about more than a missing bedroom door, it's rapidly escalating abuse. *She's waking her up at 5am to scream at her. She can't sleep because her door isn't there and her mother is behaving in terrifying ways.* She was so afraid of her mother's behavior that she ran away. \n\nThe kid has skipped grades, is taking AP classes, does ballet and piano and everything else her mother requires of her. There's no discipline problem. It's perfectly normal for a 16 year old to have a boyfriend. OP says he's a nice boy, so it's not like he's a juvenile delinquent or a creepy 20 year old. \n\nMom is pissed because her daughter is beginning to assert her personhood and is building her own relationships.  Her mom has treated her like her personal trick poodle for her entire life and she's finally slipping away from her mom's grasp. I think OP is right to keep his niece with him, because I think the abuse might escalate to physical if she goes home now.", "We don't know if OP is in the US, either, so...", "Not necessarily.  Judge will decide on what he or she determines is in the best interests of the child.  Family courts are overloaded with custody battles between actual parents.  It's uncommon for a judge to award custody to an extended family member short of both of the parents being deemed unfit.", "UK it's 16\n\nEdit: apparently they changed the age for all relationships to 16 and I missed that law.", "I asked where Crazy-Perspective lived when they moved out.  I didn't ask where the OP lived, so...", "Weird, in the states ive worked cps in, at her age she can pretty much decide where she lives. Have a good day."]}
