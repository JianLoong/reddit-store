Piano, ballet and cram class. You name it. She never had any behavioral issues and I adore her. She got a boyfriend last year. I met him and he was a good, honest fellow.\n\nAnyways here was the problem, my cousin(her mom) caught wind of this and was absolutely furious, grounding her and keeping trackers on her. For heads up I do not have a good relationship with my cousin but we have kept it civil. She was the typical snobby church mom who thinks that everything about her daughter has to be perfect. Anyways, this morning I found my niece camping in my apartment lobby. Apparently ever since my cousin found out, she has frequently been waking my niece up at 5am screaming at her in the name of educating her about sex and the dangers of it. My poor niece is visibly in a really bad shape right now. She\u2019s already two grades ahead with tons of AP equivalent classes here. She also has a bunch of activities outside of her school she has to keep up with. My cousin also removed the locks to my niece's room so my niece can\u2019t even get a good night's rest cause she's terrified.\n\nI\u2019m currently taking care of her and her mom demanded that I return her child. My girlfriend doesn't mind my niece living with us and has been accommodating to her but my whole extended family has been pressuring me to return my niece. \n\nMy niece also said she would go back but I really can\u2019t tell if it was because she\u2019s afraid of her mom or she really wants to go home. So WIBTA for continue to force my niece to stay with me?\n\nEdit: oh yes I'm looking into cps. I'm just afraid that they send my niece into foster care.\n\nEdit: so basically like alot of people said that while CPS can still look into this, she is \"emancipated\"(that's not the term my friend used here but basically it means she can consent to where she wants to live in) meaning that unless my niece specifically stand against me in court saying I kidnapped her, I'm not actually in any legal issues. And I've contacted her dad(fyi his not with my cousin anymore). Who will be flying in from outside of the country to settle this.", "created_utc": 1685116098, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13sgr4m/wibta_for_forcibly_removing_my_niece_from_her_mom/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

While what your cousin is doing is terrible, it\u2019s probably not enough to have her removed from the home. (Though you can try) Even if she is removed, they likely won\u2019t put a 16 year old with a 25 year old cousin. There\u2019s going to be other family put ahead of you, if they even consider you at all.", "NTA. A 16 year old isn't just handed over like a toddler. She can willingly return if and when she chooses. Morally you're totally in the clear but absolutely get legal advice.", "NTA, but be aware in the UK a child is the parent/guardian's responsibility until they are 18, and your cousin does sound like the type to get a court order to force your niece back home, however, she is suffering abuse at the hands of her mother, you need to involve social services and probably a lawyer.", "INFO: At what age does a person become legally and adult where you live?", "This is a really difficult one. Because ultimately you need to think about if you can realistically afford to take her in. \n\nAt 16 Although legally \"independent\", they rarely actually are. So if you take her in, are you also willing to take on all the expenses she may potentially come with? \n\nI think you're absolutely trying to do the best thing for this girl, so NTA. But I do think you need to consider what this involves more long term if you genuinely want to help support her.", "I don\u2019t know about being TA, but you\u2019re likely in violation of some laws, depending on where you live. It seems that your second cousin/niece ran away from home, and her mother is failing to understand that if you take her back, she will likely run away again. Except this time she might not go somewhere she\u2019s safe.  If I were you, I\u2019d try very hard to work something out (maybe get other family involved) with your cousin before police start knocking on your door.", "Edit: I re-read the post and saw that your niece did come to you first. changed vote to NAH\n\n Your heart is in the right place. You(changed) could potentially be kidnapping a minor if her mom asks for her to come over... There is not the way to go about it other than to say that is what you will be doing if you refuse to take her back.\n\nNOW it sounds like she went and stayed with you so she essentially Ran Away and is staying with family. So yeah... \n\nyou don't have to call CPS - as you know what- this probably isn't something that will get her taken away. Parents are allowed to yell at their kids. Parents are allowed to be shitty. As long as the kid is fed, has a safe home, and is not being physically abused or confined- they probably wont do anything.   \n\nI would instead go and talk with your cousin. Maybe she is having a mental breakdown and needs intervention.   \n\nMost likely CPS would not send the child to foster care if a relative can take them in (depending on state and local laws). But I highly doubt CPS would do anything.   \n\nBest of luck in this situation. I am glad your niece has someone to go to. Best thing to do in this situation is to become her advocate and mediator.", "It's likely you cannot do that legally. Speak to a lawyer.", "I'm not going to make a judgement personally. I will say if the situation is close enough to what you believe is abuse (which is the only reason I believe would be acceptable for you trying to keep your niece with you) then you need to call the police. If it hasn't gotten to a point where you would call it abuse then at most you should talk to her mom and try to help with the situation.", "I'm not going to make a judgment, because I understand why you want to do this, but if you keep your niece against her mother's wishes, it's kidnapping. If her mother gets the police involved, they're unlikely to let her stay with you. It's less than 2 years until she turns 18; I suggest letting her go home, but making it clear to her that she's welcome to return in a crisis (if something happens that's so bad that it's worth getting CPS involved, even if that means she's taken into care) or when she turns 18.", "YTA.\n\n>So WIBTA for continue to force my niece to stay with me?\n\nYou can't kidnap someone else's minor child just because you have determined that this person is a bad parent or you would be a better parent.\n\nIf you believe your cousin is committing a crime, like child abuse, call the police.\n\nIf you believe you have some legal basis for claiming custody of your niece over her biological parents, file an action in court.", "YTA.\n\nCall child services if you are that concerned but don't take someone's child. It could be called kidnapping in an extreme case.", "YTA. That child does not belong to you OP, period. Unless you have legal custody, you cannot force a child who is not biologically yours to live with you in the same dwelling. Please contact CPS if there are concerns about abuse. Don't get yourself into any legal trouble, including be possibly charged with kidnapping.", "YTA.\n\nCall child services if you are that concerned but don't take someone's child. It could be called kidnapping in an extreme case.", "YTA. If you are concerned about her well-being then you call CPS and have this situation investigated. From what you described, the mother is religious and doesn\u2019t want her 16 year old dating. Just because you don\u2019t agree with someone\u2019s parenting doesn\u2019t mean you kidnap their child and prevent them from returning back to their home.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Half the time it sounds like you\u2019re simply giving her a place to stay, and half the time it sounds like you\u2019re forcing her to. Forcing her is kidnapping.
