Piano, ballet and cram class. You name it. She never had any behavioral issues and I adore her. She got a boyfriend last year. I met him and he was a good, honest fellow.\n\nAnyways here was the problem, my cousin(her mom) caught wind of this and was absolutely furious, grounding her and keeping trackers on her. For heads up I do not have a good relationship with my cousin but we have kept it civil. She was the typical snobby church mom who thinks that everything about her daughter has to be perfect. Anyways, this morning I found my niece camping in my apartment lobby. Apparently ever since my cousin found out, she has frequently been waking my niece up at 5am screaming at her in the name of educating her about sex and the dangers of it. My poor niece is visibly in a really bad shape right now. She\u2019s already two grades ahead with tons of AP equivalent classes here. She also has a bunch of activities outside of her school she has to keep up with. My cousin also removed the locks to my niece's room so my niece can\u2019t even get a good night's rest cause she's terrified.\n\nI\u2019m currently taking care of her and her mom demanded that I return her child. My girlfriend doesn't mind my niece living with us and has been accommodating to her but my whole extended family has been pressuring me to return my niece. \n\nMy niece also said she would go back but I really can\u2019t tell if it was because she\u2019s afraid of her mom or she really wants to go home. So WIBTA for continue to force my niece to stay with me?\n\nEdit: oh yes I'm looking into cps. I'm just afraid that they send my niece into foster care.\n\nEdit: so basically like alot of people said that while CPS can still look into this, she is \"emancipated\"(that's not the term my friend used here but basically it means she can consent to where she wants to live in) meaning that unless my niece specifically stand against me in court saying I kidnapped her, I'm not actually in any legal issues. And I've contacted her dad(fyi his not with my cousin anymore). Who will be flying in from outside of the country to settle this.\n\nAlso yeah my first response was a bit stupid but I guarantee you it was in good faith. My cousin isn't a gentle parenting parent.\n\nSo my niece went to school and i settled it with her parents. Her dad's going to be back in a few weeks and we will settle it by then. For now my niece will be staying with me.\n\nAlso when I say i forced her, i don't mean physically locking her in a room but as in, i persuaded her really hard to stay. And she said she \"would go home\" but not \"want to go home\". I could tell that she offered to go home not cause she wanted to but she was scared of what her mother would do if she didn't.\n\nYeah apparently a lot of people corrected me on that.

It could very easily turn around and get you into A LOT of trouble with the law, not to mention your family (although I don't know your family dynamic, I assume that if you are playing this big of a role in your cousins kids lives that you are fairly close as a family)... Contact a lawyer! So many will give you a free consultation. I would recommend looking for one that specializes in family/custody law and really learn your rights, your nieces rights and your cousins rights and then have a real conversation with your niece where you outline how you see the situation and your offer for her to stay with you (as long as your lawyer or your local law enforcement confirms it is not illegal to house her)... I know this is an especially hard situation, but don't let your emotions blind you to the very real legal ramifications that you could incur if you don't fully understand the law as it pertains to your situation in your area. I know the urge to be the savior to your niece in this instance is strong, which is admirable, but for the love of god.... Know your rights and cover your ass... I would hate to see your attempt at a good deed towards your niece land you in prison for kidnapping of a minor because of some weird/overlooked detail\n\nEdit: And for the record NTA.

That safe person might be you and it might not, maybe a counsellor or other neutral unbiased party.
