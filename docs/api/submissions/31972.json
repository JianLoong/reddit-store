And as someone who was constantly told I looked far older than my age when I was a teen, sometimes it's not possible to get a judge of someone's age.

Stay away from that girl! \ud83d\ude05. NTA.", "Nta", "NTA. Honestly, the girl might be a minor but you\u2019re all essentially children (and I don\u2019t mean that in a rude way). As you get older, it definitely gets easier to identify people who are \u201ctoo young for you\u201d and I\u2019d probably have a different opinion if you were 30. At 18, however, you probably could\u2019ve been schoolmates with this girl less than a year ago. It\u2019s perfectly natural that you\u2019d notice someone around your age and find them attractive. Your brother sounds like an absolute weirdo for taking such offense to a simple comment.", "No, if you were to pursue her then yeah YTA and a creep but a passing comment that a young person is attractive isn't a bad thing at all, it's not like you were leaching all over her.", "NTA\nKinda sounds like you brother has a crush on her and didn\u2019t like the thought of his older/cooler brother sweeping in and taking her away. Especially since he\u2019s still holding  such immature resentment.", "NTA. You specifically asked for her age and backed out when he told you. It's not like you were hitting on her or asked for her number or anything. Also, you're 18. Where I live, the legal age of consent is 15. Very few would bat an eye at it if you did try to pursue her.", "lmaoooo brainrot", "NTA think your brother is just being annoying and trying to get you in trouble for fun. Honestly just ignore him.

It's a new generation thing. I'm 24 and this has only happened in recent years. Unless the very obvious age gap.

She can be pretty and all ages can think so.   That is where it ends though.", "Depends on the law of the country. In many countries 16&20 for example can be legal depending on a bunch of factors. Probably 15&19 as well but that I don't know for sure. From what I remember there was a hard line at some age(16 most common in europe?), but after that there's more of a blurry line. A position of power is a big no, in any shape or form and stuff like that. \n A friend dated another friend when we were around that age so I got some info on it but can't remember much. I think it came down to the fact that they were around the same point of education/life and she in general was more mature at 16 than him at 20. \n\nJust saying in many places there is in fact a \"practically minor\" in the eyes of the law.", "There actually is, several states have \"Romeo and Juliet\" laws.

I know i would use anything no matter how small to get my older brother in trouble when I was younger.", "NTA, but he might like her.", "A lot of the times kids pursue lines of reasoning like this because they expect different consequences than what an adult knows would follow.  E.g. he's knows there is some kind of negative association for older men liking young girls, but doesn't know the entire scope of what that accusation might entail, or when to apply it appropriately.  He's only concerned with that one sliver of what he thinks will happen, not looking at the whole picture.", "I'm with you. The only explanation I can think of that makes sense of your brothers reaction is that maybe he himself has a crush on her and wanted to squash any competition.", "I will be honest - me neither at 15 - but the world is fucked these days.", "Also kids that age seem super devoted to dying on strange hills", "Ohh, that's neat. I need to look into places with lower age of consents.", "Definitely could be the case.", "Could be the case.

Could just be a him thing.", "That sounds creepy.
