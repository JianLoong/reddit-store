I didn't care that he moved in because the space we lived in had plenty of room.  Back then and now, I, like a good chunk of people, wear the basic T-shirts and boxers as my PJs.  One day, I came out of my room into the kitchen in those pj's, and he asked me not to wear the boxers around the house anymore.  I told him, \"I pay rent here, and I am not walking around naked, I don't see a problem.\"  His response.\"You're wearing underware as clothing. It makes me uncomfortable.\"  Because of that response, I tried to be nice and not walk out of my room in that type of pj set anymore.  \n        However, I still wore it. Every now and then, I would be in our kitchen in Boxers and a t-shirt just eating cereal in the morning, and he would continue to complain if he saw me.  I didn't think I should plan when I go into our shared spaces around him.\nFinally, I went to my sister and she agreed that he was being ridiculous.  Apparently, that caused a huge fight between them, and I felt guilty that I caused it.\nSo.. AITA for still wearing boxers and a T-shirt as Pj's even though i knew he didn't like it?\nETA: I no longer live with my sister, and she is no longer with that guy.\nETA: Yes, this was a long time ago, and the problem is over.

Full on sexism against man because apprently , we cannot be allowed to feel uncomfortable and if we do its because we cannot control our dicks.\n\nImagine a women making a post about a male living in her space always wearing boxers around  and she would feel uncomfortable. I doubt any of you woukd tell her to keep her fucking lust in check and just accept that its how it is from now on otherwise she is a fucking predator right ?", "From the story, it sounds like you were intentionally misleading in the title.

You are directly ignoring his perfectly reasonable request and that's rude as hell.\n\n>I didn't think I should plan when I go into our shared spaces around him\n\nYou don't FFS.

I can guarantee he isn't uncomfortable on the beach with all the women in thong bikinis, or in the mall with all the daisy dukes. You lived there first.

Your body? His attempts to make your clothes inappropriate was in and of itself inappropriate.", "NTA, 10/10 he fancied you in that outfit and that's why he was making a fuss.

Yes YTA, I can only imagine if the roles were reversed and the guy refused to put on pants to make his gf\u2019s sister comfortable in their own home.
