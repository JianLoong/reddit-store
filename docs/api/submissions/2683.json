Celebrate it!", "Since when do families stop celebrating birthdays because the oldest moves out?", "NTA  \nSorry he's no longer your friend. Religion is now more important than respecting you, listening to you or accepting you as who you are.", "NTA You stated you didn't want any gifts, you've told him before you don't want to be converted, and he crossed both boundaries in on go. \n\nAlso, when did most families stop celebrating birthdays just because the oldest kid moves out? I'm sorry but your parents lied to you.", "Definitely NTA. I would hazard a guess that his determination to convert you is, at least in part, due to his own \"guilt\" over his \"perversions\" and he thinks if he can get you over to jesus too, it will somehow \"absolve\" him \ud83d\ude44 time to just cut ties honestly and hope he finds his way out eventually.", "NTA. \n\nThat wasn\u2019t a gift, that was an insult.

It got uglier from there tbh.

And when you called him on it, he lashed out at you instead of expressing any hint of remorse for your discomfort.\n\nThis religion is his new addiction. It is  intruding in areas of his life outside of his church and negatively impacting his relationship with you.

He may decide this is his new identity and stick with it until the day he dies, or he realizes he is hiding a big part of himself and leaves.", "NTA. Some churches actively encourage their members to behave in ways that alienate people who are not in the church. The heavy-handed proselytizing feels to them like they're trying to reach out and do you a favor, but of course to those on the receiving end, it feels off-putting and hurtful. The church member gets rebuffed, and runs back to the arms of the church, where people say, \"See, those secular folks are terrible people who hate us and don't want to be saved.\" It's like an abusive partner isolating their victim from friends and family. \n\nYou have to take care of your own mental health and well-being, so you may need to cut off this friend. However, if you have the emotional resources, you might consider \"gray-rocking,\" where you still hang out with your friend, but you're basically a \"gray rock\" when it comes to the proselytizing. No response, no engagement, change the subject. Meet only in places where you can say, \"It was nice seeing you, have a great week,\" and get up and leave when he starts in. That way, if he eventually wakes up and wants to leave the church and rejoin the regular world, he has a pathway open. \n\nSorry you're going through this.

They let us know when their church services are and that we\u2019re welcome to come or not as we choose when we visit (we do occasionally go to a Christmas service with them, because I love Christmas music and I love my in-laws).  That\u2019s where it stops.  We all respect each other\u2019s beliefs, and give each other room to practice or not as we feel called.\n\nYou\u2019re justifying behavior that reasonable people of all faiths can agree is unwanted and rude.", "Okay, well to be ABUNDANTLY clear, you\u2019re more than fine and sound very thoughtful and educated/informed. And re birthdays, I mean you don\u2019t have to be crazy but like treat yourself to some cake or something. You\u2019re awesome and worthy of being celebrated once a year at least :)", "Seconding this: birthdays don't stop being celebrated when the oldest kid becomes an adult unless your parents are just getting tired of parenting. It may not be normal to have a huge celebration of every year, but milestones and at least a cake and family dinner of the birthday kid's choice.", "your birthday is important! happy birthday and stay cool \ud83d\ude0e", "Ohhh \ud83d\ude15", "Maybe that's what his mum told him so she didn't have to spend money or clean up. Sounds like there were a few of them.", "I get it, it's a jarring switch, but it's the current reality. You're going to have to let go of the past and just think about who he is now", "Not celebrating birthdays for children is only a thing with Jehovah's Witnesses. Birthdays are normally a special occasion with all children until at least late teens. NTA.", "I'd say it's easier to fake it if you feel like you have to, as a bisexual person I can attest to that. He's probably being told the drinking caused the bisexuality or something and feeling like shit about it and apparently you're going to fix that by somehow not being gay \ud83d\ude02 I really wish there were more programs that didn't rely on a heavy dose of the bible to get people through addiction. I get that it helps some people but honestly it feels like preying on a vulnerable group of people and calling it saving them.", "I just saw in another comment how you said you guys were Friends+ and it made me laugh so hard \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019m sorry he\u2019s doing this to you, Christians really know how to grate the nerves lol", "It happens :/", "Well yeah, the thing about holding an incorrect belief system is it leads to contradictions and other silliness if you examine it.", "Sects, denominations, and movements are all pretty accepted ways to describe the different branches of Judaism.  Movements tend to be used for the smaller sub-sub divisions (so the Haredi movement is a sub-group of Orthodox Jews, for example).", "The way people make others out to be bad if they don\u2019t agree with them is odd to me. I\u2019ve never understood why \u201cI HAVE to save you, even if you don\u2019t want to hear it\u201d means anything except rude.", "I am fully aware that most Christians are practical, agreeable and likable people. I think that's because most Christians realize, whether consciously or unconsciously, that you can't actually believe in, and obey, every word in the Bible or even in the New Testament. Because if you believed every word of it, you would have to believe that OP is on track for everlasting hellfire. And it would be worth being annoying and aggressive and confrontational to try to do something about it, because if you do nothing, he's staying on that track, and even if your efforts don't work, he's no worse off.", "I mean it also coincided with my mother getting super into the drug fandom, I just kinda assumed she was telling the truth since everyone went along with it. This is however the same family that convinced me our town tire down the statue at the edge of town out of sadness because I was born (it was actually struck by lightning like a week before I was born)", "Oh it\u2019s definitely preying on them, no doubt about it. Instead of trying to fix the issue, they just have to trust in god to make them all better, including their sexuality.", "Yeah, like legit he and I were regularly sharing a bed and all that comes with it and then suddenly straight I just...", "Christians don't think \"we're good and everyone else is bad,\" they think \"EVERYONE is incredibly bad including us, but Jesus is going to save us in spite of how bad we are\"", "You said that not shoving your religion at others only makes sense to \u201csecular people and hypocrites.\u201d  That doesn\u2019t seem to track at all with understanding that most religious people are perfectly capable of coexisting in polite society.", "No worse off only in the aforementioned Pascal\u2019s Wager sense.", "> I am fully aware that most Christians are practical, agreeable and likable people. \n\nNever been to the United States?", "Dude, your family has some issues.", "But it isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s place to foist their beliefs off on others. I\u2019m sorry if I failed to point the finger at the ones trying to change others.", "Because they are hypocrites, a little bit. They pick and choose which words to believe while professing that they believe them all. It's ok, it's not some great crime, I do the same.", "Good insight", "Yeah :/", "That's one attitude that you could have. A different attitude you could have is that everyone should believe the truth, because the truth is good, and lies are bad and no one should believe them. That attitude plus some confusion and misplaced confidence about what the truth actually is = evangelism.", "By your definition, there isn\u2019t a soul alive who isn\u2019t a hypocrite.  Seems like a ridiculously broad use of a loaded, powerful word.", "But from everyone\u2019s point of view, they are right. I don\u2019t think anyone should judge anyone else in such matters. One\u2019s point of view is theirs and unless they ask someone to, it\u2019s not up to anyone to change them. We can\u2019t say who is right or wrong for sure. It\u2019s not up to anyone to judge and try to change other just because they think the other person is wrong.", "We should invent a mild version of the word, I would use it."]}
