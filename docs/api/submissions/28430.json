Your mother is unfairly putting the responsibility of rewarding your sister onto you. I'm not sure what a ULTA card is or what else is going on, but I'm going to guess that your family doesn't have much money. None of that should be your burden to carry. That is your parents' burden. \n\nYour mom needs to get more creative about how to reward your sister if she can't afford to buy her things. Maybe write her a nice letter about how proud she is of her. Maybe letting her pick the family meals from a reasonable selection for the next while, or picking her some wildflowers, or doing a baking day together. ANYTHING but making it your responsibility to do the parenting. I know that stuff might not be \"cool\" to a young teen, but your mom also needs to model that what's popular isn't as important as being kind to one another, and it doesn't sound like she's doing that at all. \n\nHang in there. You're almost old enough to be on your own and create some distance from this situation. I remember what it was like to be forced to be the more mature one, even than my parents, as the eldest, and in some ways it's still like that with my mother.

It's questionable to me that your sister doing the bare minimum at school is worth a reward, but in any case, that's up to your parents to decide AND provide! I would not speak a word to your sister or your mother until you are compensated for your stolen card.", "\"I am not her parent, you are. It is your job to provide for her, punish her, and reward her. Pushing off your parental responsibilities to me teaches both of your daughters a very bad lesson. Your younger daughter has learned to steal from a family member's room and I have learned that my mother doesn't respect me and sees me as a tool to help parent her sister, rather than a human being who deserves respect for their space and property.

Discipline and rewards are the caregiver's responsibility. Trying to shove that off onto the sibling is just wrong. IF I was ever in a position like that, it would be handled quietly, discreetly, and with the promise of paying my child back. Also, \"No\" is always an acceptable answer. Consent doesn't only apply to bedroom situations. If my child refused to give over something of theirs even with the promise of reimbursement, then the answer is no! I would find some other way of expressing my pride in my child.\n\nFlat out, you told your mom no, and then she had the balls to tell your sister about it anyway? That is classic manipulation. She turned you and your sister against each other to try and bully you into what she wanted. Likely because she didn't want to put forth any effort and/or resources into the situation herself. And then to go and steal it after you said no repeatedly? Hunny, I'm sorry, but your mom and sister are shitty people. Find a better way to stash your stuff. This will not be the last time this happens. Your mother is teaching your sister that you are less important than she is. They trampled all over your boundaries in multiple ways. Cut contact with them as soon as you can and save yourself a lot of stress. They're not going to improve unless they hit rock bottom.

And your mom seems to have confused you with another parent or an ATM. You're a minor, with two parents, it is no way your job to give up your property to reward your sister.

If I were you I\u2019d go buy a gift card, use it yourself (or for your friends gift) then leave the empty gift card in your sisters room and let her go use it and get denied\u2026\u2026but your mom is the AH", "NTA \n\nYour mother is just setting your sister up for failure, not success.  The real world doesn't reward people for the bare minimum and excuse theft.", "Who in their right mind thinks it's the SIBLINGS responsibility to reward doing something?!? NTA at all but your mother takes the AH cake and rolls in it. At 15 I had a job babysitting to get things I wanted and my siblings did the same. If we did a good job in school we got to pick dinner for a week and a summer activity of our choice. That worked well for us and I still have never needed my siblings to do more than say \"Way to go\" or \"Good job\" to know they cared. We are all in our 40's now and still talk regularly about anything and everything.  What your mother is doing is creating a division in the siblings group.", "NTA. The parents can reward their kids if they're doing well in some respect. It's not usually left up to older siblings.", "Your mother had no right to want your gift card.

I would encourage you to get a job and get out as soon as possible.", "NTA\n \nSince it's been stolen, call the non emergency number for the police and report it.

Looks like mom and/or sister stole from you.", "NTA- It's not your job to reward her for doing what she's supposed to do to begin with. If your Mom wants to bribe her to continue going to school that's her problem. Why did she make it yours?", "Well now your sister if a thief too.

Your parents are always going to want you to support sibling due to her having problems. She will likely have a lot of money problems in life if she can't even buckle down to go to school. She will end up in low paying jobs and will get fired from jobs for not showing up. You will be asked to help support her. Hide your money and never let your family know you have it or gift cards.

Good luck.", "[removed]", "Agreed - OP is NTA and her mom and sister were already bad enough for the entitlement but now they're even worse for the theft. \n\nOP, if your dad is reasonable, tell him about them stealing the gift card and ask that it be replaced.
