My mom got slightly upset, telling me that my sister has been doing really well in school and she deserves a treat.\n\nMy sister has had a reputation of not attending the school and almost being held back because she just doesn't like going.

I am too because it has been a source of stress for everyone.\n\nI told my mom that I'm happy for my sister but I'm not giving her the gift card, and then told my mom that if she wants to give her a gift card, she can purchase her a $15 one.\n\nMy mom got upset at this and told me that my friend shouldn't come before my sister and that I should give the card to her to show that I support her.\n\nI told her that it was my card and she wasn't going to change my mind.\n\nShe called me an AH but I didn't care because she's done things like this in the past.\n\nHowever today my sister came up to me and told me she was going to the mall.

I just ignored her and walked to my room. What followed next was a loud crying fit from her and my mom storming up to my room and calling me an AH for treating my sister so horribly and that now she thinks im not proud of her.\n\nIt's a few hours later and I feel sort've bad because my sister has made progress and I am proud of her, but I don't want to give her my card when I'm saving it.\n\nAITA?\n\nedit: I went to go check on the gift card and it's gone. my sister is out of the house and still went to the mall.

Did your mom say why she wanted you, specifically, to reward your sister for improving her behavior? Discipline is the parents\u2019 purview, not the sibling who\u2019s only two years older than the child in question\u2026", "NTA. Your mother is unfairly putting the responsibility of rewarding your sister onto you. I'm not sure what a ULTA card is or what else is going on, but I'm going to guess that your family doesn't have much money. None of that should be your burden to carry. That is your parents' burden. \n\nYour mom needs to get more creative about how to reward your sister if she can't afford to buy her things. Maybe write her a nice letter about how proud she is of her. Maybe letting her pick the family meals from a reasonable selection for the next while, or picking her some wildflowers, or doing a baking day together. ANYTHING but making it your responsibility to do the parenting. I know that stuff might not be \"cool\" to a young teen, but your mom also needs to model that what's popular isn't as important as being kind to one another, and it doesn't sound like she's doing that at all. \n\nHang in there. You're almost old enough to be on your own and create some distance from this situation. I remember what it was like to be forced to be the more mature one, even than my parents, as the eldest, and in some ways it's still like that with my mother. Distance helps.", "Whoever took your gift card is a thief.\n\nBoth your mom ad sister are AHs.\n\nHide your money and valuables.\n\nLeave as soon as you are old enough.", "NTA\n\nWhat is wrong with your family that they want YOU to gift your sister something? That's your parent's responsibility. You should get a gift card too because you are going to school too.", "Of course NTA, if it was given to you as a gift, you get to decide what to use it for. \n\nThere are other things that you can do to show that you're proud of someone.\n\nETA This is on your mother, she built your sister's expectations up when you already said no. She probably expected you to cave and give it to her. She shouldn't have promised something that wasn't hers to begin with.", "NTA. Use it online if you can to wipe the balance. Walk right up to them, look them in the eye and destroy the card.", "NTA, there are a million other ways to make her feel special for doing well in school. The fixation on the gift card is absolutely bizarre to begin with, maybe less so if your mom has no extra money to buy her a treat... but she's the asshole for making a false promise to your sister and starting a conflict between you two over something extremely stupid.", "NTA and your update is really frustrating. It's questionable to me that your sister doing the bare minimum at school is worth a reward, but in any case, that's up to your parents to decide AND provide! I would not speak a word to your sister or your mother until you are compensated for your stolen card.", "\"I am not her parent, you are. It is your job to provide for her, punish her, and reward her. Pushing off your parental responsibilities to me teaches both of your daughters a very bad lesson. Your younger daughter has learned to steal from a family member's room and I have learned that my mother doesn't respect me and sees me as a tool to help parent her sister, rather than a human being who deserves respect for their space and property. I'm disappointed in how selfish both of you were today.\" \n\nNTA.", "So let me get this straight: your sister manages to go to school everyday, so she gets rewarded and you get punished?\n\nNTA, but your mom sure is.

Second if she wanted to reward her for her progress, she should've gotten her something herself, that is not your child, and you are under any obligation to give up something that belongs to you.\n\nThe fact that your stuff has been stolen lets me know just who the golden child is, what your mom did is awful, and not to mention mean to deprive you of something you were saving for a special occasion.\n\nFirst chance you get buy something you can lock your valuables in because this may not be the last thing that comes up missing to make your sister feel better. I'm sorry your mother doesn't value you or your belongings. Good luck, you won't be there for long, and your mom will wonder why you don't talk to her anymore.", "NTA - Announce to the entire family your mom is either raising a thief or is one. If people ask why, explain it. I am in full support of naming and shaming.", "NTA but your mom sure is. I would start hounding your mom for the value of the gift card.", "NTA- Your sister sounds like the golden child who can do no wrong. Even if she's making progress, it shouldn't be at the cost of your things. \n\nYour mom is an AH and she's raising your sister to be an AH and a brat. Your sister is 15 and she's having a crying fit over this is a big issue. That's your mom's fault.\n\nAnd now the gift card is gone according to your edit. That's theft!", "NTA\n\nThis is called having boundaries, spine, and holding your ground. You've learned a valuable lesson for adulthood, and all it took was having a manipulative and overly indulgent mother try to weedle things out of you by making it seem like you'd be an asshole for having reasonable limitations.", "Why should your sister get a treat for doing something she\u2019s supposed to do?  Even so, like you said, your mom can get it for her.  NTA", "Ok so she STOLE IT???? TF?", "NTA. It is not your responsibility to reward her.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your job to reward your sister.

And I was doing well in school when you where only doing shit, a desearve a treat for that too..\n\nNTA\nI\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t be proud or even give her a treat if you want to, but demanding it??? For doing something she is supposed to do anyway??? Hell no", "So who stole it? Can\u2019t you get to the mall? I know it\u2019s not a huge amount but I am upset for you. NTA.

You were the recipient?\n\nWhat the hell is an ULTA card?", "NTA.

Why in hell should you be responsible for \"rewarding\" your sister? You are 100% correct, this is your mother's deal, not yours.  \nI would confiscate the ULTA purchases when your sister gets home.", "she said that I'm not doing enough for my sister and my sister thinks im not proud of her, so I should give her the card so she knows im proud of her", "Hi, my family isn't poor so money isn't the issue. My mom doesn't like spending money on people other than herself, she doesn't pay the bills, groceries, etc. \n\nShe wanted me to give my sister the gift card because according to her my sister doesn't think I support her as much and im not proud of her, but im inclined to believe it's because she doesn't want to spend money. \n\nBut thank you for your kind words, I do plan on distancing myself from my mother when I get older, mostly due to the fact that anything that I need she turns into an issue", "She did that so that OP wouldn't be able to say no (that was the plan), now it's missing I believe her mother let her sister take it and go to the mall.
