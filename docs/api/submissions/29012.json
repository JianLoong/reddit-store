He has mentioned this a few times I haven\u2019t expressed concern as he is being a decent person by hearing out her woes. \n\n\nBut I explicitly told him that going out with her alone for lunch is not really something I am comfortable with at this point. I mentioned if he would like to treat her to lunch at the office, I am okay with that if he must, but not okay with them going out, just the two of them. \n\n\nI said this quite calmly, expecting him to understand. He heard me out but it did lead to an argument and things were said. In the heat of it I said \u2018do what you want, and dont tell me about it\u2019. \n\n\nToday I found out that they did go for lunch 2 months ago and my husband hid it from me under the pretext of \u2018you said you didnt want to know\u2019. \n\n\nI obviously lost my sh*t and gave him a hard time about it. I was enraged, to put it mildly. I did yell and cry and was generally quite loud about the whole thing. I also accused him of cheating me - not cheating ON me but cheating me and hiding the truth in general. I also said it was convenient to use it as an excuse that I told him to do what he wants, when I clearly meant it in a sarcastic, in-genuine way. I also said that it was unfair to expect me to absolve him just because he went to some other restaurant and not the initial one that I had objected to. \n\n\nI\u2019m afraid this made me the AH because it makes me come across as a needy, insecure wife, when I could have rather had a more mature reaction to it. I guess my husband expects me to forgive it and take into account that he is apologetic, albeit after the damage was done. \n\n\nFYI: We are almost 7 months in to marriage and although we have dated for years, this behavior does come as a shock to me because he has always been a very transparent and trustworthy person, as far as I have known. \n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697420230, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178uoga/aita_because_i_reacted_badly_when_my_husband_went/", "score": 131, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

After many shitty relationships at my own fault or others, I can tell you this is definitely a we-need-to-talk situation, even if he is truly just being a \"great friend.\" Even if it is strictly an emotional interest for a need for connection or understanding, or kind words from someone, rather that outright flirting, that's still something he should go to YOU for, and if he's willingly hid this from you, I worry what else he has \"innocently\" excused himself from sharing, from my own experience, being a slimeball. If it wasn't a boundary he felt he could push, he wouldn't have had to make an excuse at all, because he would know that once you said no, that's it; he should respect it because you're too important to lose, period. The fact he asked, and then took any excuse you gave him, could easily just be a miscommunication, but it could also be bad sign that he's already in an emotional affair or worse, and you guys need to talk.
