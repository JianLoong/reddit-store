He has mentioned this a few times I haven\u2019t expressed concern as he is being a decent person by hearing out her woes. \n\n\nBut I explicitly told him that going out with her alone for lunch is not really something I am comfortable with at this point. I mentioned if he would like to treat her to lunch at the office, I am okay with that if he must, but not okay with them going out, just the two of them. \n\n\nI said this quite calmly, expecting him to understand. He heard me out but it did lead to an argument and things were said. In the heat of it I said \u2018do what you want, and dont tell me about it\u2019. \n\n\nToday I found out that they did go for lunch 2 months ago and my husband hid it from me under the pretext of \u2018you said you didnt want to know\u2019. \n\n\nI obviously lost my sh*t and gave him a hard time about it. I was enraged, to put it mildly. I did yell and cry and was generally quite loud about the whole thing. I also accused him of cheating me - not cheating ON me but cheating me and hiding the truth in general. I also said it was convenient to use it as an excuse that I told him to do what he wants, when I clearly meant it in a sarcastic, in-genuine way. I also said that it was unfair to expect me to absolve him just because he went to some other restaurant and not the initial one that I had objected to. \n\n\nI\u2019m afraid this made me the AH because it makes me come across as a needy, insecure wife, when I could have rather had a more mature reaction to it. I guess my husband expects me to forgive it and take into account that he is apologetic, albeit after the damage was done. \n\n\nFYI: We are almost 7 months in to marriage and although we have dated for years, this behavior does come as a shock to me because he has always been a very transparent and trustworthy person, as far as I have known. \n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697420230, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178uoga/aita_because_i_reacted_badly_when_my_husband_went/", "score": 808, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

After many shitty relationships at my own fault or others, I can tell you this is definitely a we-need-to-talk situation, even if he is truly just being a \"great friend.\" Even if it is strictly an emotional interest for a need for connection or understanding, or kind words from someone, rather that outright flirting, that's still something he should go to YOU for, and if he's willingly hid this from you, I worry what else he has \"innocently\" excused himself from sharing, from my own experience, being a slimeball. If it wasn't a boundary he felt he could push, he wouldn't have had to make an excuse at all, because he would know that once you said no, that's it; he should respect it because you're too important to lose, period. The fact he asked, and then took any excuse you gave him, could easily just be a miscommunication, but it could also be bad sign that he's already in an emotional affair or worse, and you guys need to talk.

He didn\u2019t initially try and hide this. You then implied that you didn\u2019t trust him not to cheat on you by saying you were uncomfortable with him going to lunch with another woman. I can see why an argument broke out if you have so little faith in your husband. You should acknowledge this and seek to work on this. Instead of trying to discuss this you then childishly dismissed him telling him to \u2018do what you want\u2019.  You could have tried to unpack why you were uncomfortable with this and get him to agree with this boundary. Instead you did the opposite.\n\nWhen you found out that he did exactly what you gave him permission to do, but not at a place that was special to you both, your response was to start yelling and crying and calling him an asshole. You really come across as more jealous and insecure and all you did was show - on both occasions - that you have no trust or faith in your husband not to cheat on you, which I take it he has no history of doing so if you made no mention of it. You had no proof that he was doing anything untoward, only your paranoia and insecurity. Do you act like this with all his friends?

OP states that he only saw her as an acquaintance and was uncomfortable with her sharing things to this level, but couldn\u2019t use his words just like OP and to let coworker know that he was uncomfortable having discussion on this level. \n\nWow so not only is husband only acting like a nice guy and coworkers friend because he wanted a free ride, but OP was fine with him being alone together for car rides with coworker to and from work but lost her shit about them having lunch?

It usually ends in divorce. You aren't being unreasonable even if your husband is happy she may say something that bothers her in her relationship that she knows you do to him and he'll say oh yeah my wife does that to me. I hate it and he'll dwell on it and since it's a mutual issue that's all they talk about and pretty soon that's all hell think about and all your other good qualities will be  nothing in comparison and he'll say this other woman is great and they'll have sex and then it's over. I had a friend that was a fundraiser for Catholic charities and he was traveling to another state leaving his wife at home and he was fixated on money and he met this woman that said she never heard anyone talk so passionately about his faith and she wanted him to mentor her and she was rich and they ended up cheating on his wife and she ended the relationship as she was in her right to do and it was devastating and he told me and a few friends about her and we didn't warn him because he acted like it wasn't a big deal but I wanted to warn him because I had a feeling it would end badly but i didn't and he ended up messing up and we ended up not hanging out anymore because he moved out of state. This is the basic reason why men and women shouldn't work together because you spend all day with another person of the opposite sex and if you're attracted to each other or even if you're not attracted to them but they like you and they have no morals about breaking up a marriage they will have so day every day to try to break up the marriage. If you've ever seen Seinfeld where Elaine and Jerry wanted to break up a marriage because they both wanted to date the people and they ended up breaking them up helped by George but they end up dating the divorced couple. This sounds like a silly story but there are people like that out there that try to break up marriages. If your husband doesn't be careful he will end up cheating and you'll both be miserable. I hear people say you should trust them and if you don't you're Jealous and controlling, but that's usually what a cheater says. And if they aren't cheating and even if they just think they can handle it they're being either stupid or proud. No matter how much you love the other person its hard to fend off someone that wants to break up your relationship if the person is always saying how great you are and how they wish they had someone like you or whatever they say because eventually you say my wife doesn't love me or respect me or she doesn't understand me and they cheat and you get divorced. Your husband may love you and may be strong enough to fend her off and you may not have any problems but the odds are against you. He should not be going out to lunch with her or driving to work with her and unfortunately if he tells her he wants to stop driving together she may tell the employer he sexually harassed her. And he'll be out of a job. None of this may happen but it's more than likely to happen. Your husband may be oblivious to her advances or she may not even be trying to break up your relationship she may be just needing someone to talk to but why don't you invite her to the house or say hey I hear you're having problems and offer to listen to her issues or tell her what your husband told you because if she legitimately wants advice and she's talking about it with him why wouldn't she share with you? I know she doesn't know you but sharing issues about your relationship is an intimate thing. If she's blabbing about it to him she shouldn't be tight lipped with you. If she refuses then say I'm sorry I thought you needed help and you don't know my husband but you feel you can talk to him. You're causing problems in my relationship. We're involved now.  Do you tell your husband you're hanging out with my husband. If you have problems with your husband why don't you talk to him? If he doesn't listen maybe you should get a divorce. Say I want to help you in your relationship because you've entered into my relationship and if you're not happy I'm not going to be happy. If you continue to tell my husband your problems it's going to be a problem for my relationship. If you don't care about my relationship I'm going to assume you want my husband. As a side note I wonder if you can sue people for messing up your relationship. Lawyers should look into this. It's not illegal to commit adultery but it should be since the state makes you get a marriage certificate and that's a legal document. I mean they make you get a certificate to get married isn't that like a contract. You should be able to sue someone that is trying to break up your marriage and you should be able to serve them legal papers so their husband or wife sees them that would be a real mess.", "No judgment (though i think your passiv aggressiv way of handeling this problem \"do what you want and don't tell me\" was what made this issue into a big deal and in my opinion you deserved him not telling you about it straight away, but thats bc i really really hate passiv aggressiv behaviour, its pointless and always does more damage than good). \n\nBut there is only one question here:\n\nDo you trust your husband?\n\n- If yes, there is no reason why you would want to control who he spends time with or if his colleagues are oversharing - if he is fine with it, why do you bother?\n- If no, you have bigger problems than this lunch situation and your relationship is not built on solid rocks. \n\nAnd pls don't start with the \"i trust him but not his friends/this woman etc\" BS.

Like why did the thank you have to be taking her out alone when there were other options that would not make your spouse uncomfortable. \nThen he went ahead and did it anyway and used OP obviously sarcastic remark as to why he didn\u2019t tell her.\n\nEdit: word", "It's her fault for remaining in a relationship she has zero interest in.", "lmao, again with choosing to be dense.\n\nborderline cheating for taking a relative stranger out on a date.\n\ni will say it in caps so you cannot avoid it: THEY ARE NOT FRIENDS. BY THE HUSBAND'S ADMISSION. they are colleagues, not even close ones.\n\nthis is not someone OP's husband has known long, or is friends with. stop being obtuse, it makes you look stupid.", "*Please* tell me exactly where I said he was having sex with her?  I said she was MORE than an acquaintance, that\u2019s all - You\u2019re the one bringing dicks into it\u2026..\n\nIn my personal experience, people don\u2019t *usually* go for 1:1 meals with acquaintances, but they do with friends\u2026.", "Because it was meant to be viewed as something nice. Some people, not everyone of course, but some people, enjoy going to a restaurant to eat. That is a nice thing that they would look forward to if it came up, and would appreciate more than the monetary value associated with it or with the food itself.", "Again, ignoring my points.\n\nYou sound like a perfect communicator /s.", ">**Please tell me exactly where I said he was having sex with her?**  \n>  \n>then they are definitely not \u2018just acquaintances\u2019 - make of that what you will\u2026..  \n>  \n>by taking them out for lunch - unless they are not just an acquaintance\u2026\u2026.  \n>  \n>never go for lunch alone with them unless they were also a friend\u2026.\n\nIt's almost like adults can have relationships with people that are neither romantic or as friends, but rather friendly (which is usually what you are with acquaintances). I am friendly with a guy that I used to work with. We try to get together every couple of months for lunch every couple of months to get caught up. We don't talk otherwise outside the rare text.\n\nWhat I don't get is why you are so insistent that people need to be friends to eat together. Such a bizarre thing.", "As I said that could have been accomplished if there was more people attending the restaurant trip as well or getting them a gift and card as thank you (which I just noticed was autocorrected to guys for some reason).\n\nEdit: my point was there were options that would not have made his spouse uncomfortable and he refused to consider any of them.", "Take the hint, your points aren't worth addressing. \n\nI can see why you take the side of the toxic one."]}
