Failure to thrive babies are incredibly common and it is so sad that nurses are not allowed to support mum when they're trying to feed their baby so they can grow. I feel for your wife I really do. This all sounds like PPA and PPD x Therapy would help you both. \n\nAnd your wife is not a failure. And she's not a failure for struggling to breastfeed. I can promise her that.", "You're a little bit of an asshole, but I'm chalking a lot up to the toll a baby takes on the entire family. I understand your desire to \"have your wife back\", but honestly, having a baby turns a woman into \"mommy\" for quite a while before she can take care of your needs again. (And most mommys never allow themselved to take care of their own needs.)  \n\n\nIt sounds to me like your wife has post-partum depression. If you haven't already, make sure she is getting the mental health treatments she needs. This is the #1 most important thing you can do as a husband a father becasue PPD can quickly move to suicidal tendencies.", "Both of you need to seek therapy  you are midly the AH, but clearly she has issues due to being able to feed thats causing a greater issue and you both should seek professional help", "Kindly, YTA. It's ok to be sad and upset that pumping has taken such a negative turn for both of you. \n\nBut waiting on Valentine's day to blow up on her and call it a \"waste of time\" ? You need to do a better job at communicating your feelings before they get to that point.\n\nAlso, it's not like you can choose not to pump. If you don't do it on a regular schedule, it hurts like hell.

When you told her not to bother doing it, she probably took that extremely personally, which may seem overreactive and unnecessary to you, but she's dealing with a lot of really harsh feelings about herself.\n\nIt seems like you either haven't fully realized how she's feeling about it, or don't know how to react to those feelings. She needs to know that you are in her corner, and that you value her as a partner and as a parent to your child.

You\u2019re focused on the pump and how it\u2019s dictating your lives, but this isn\u2019t about the pump. Providing breast milk to feed your child is very important to your wife. It\u2019s not important to you and she feels unsupported and like you\u2019re telling her that her sacrifices over the past ten months (and nine months of pregnancy) are a waste and not something you value. \n\nWanting private time with your wife is totally reasonable, but it\u2019s a completely different discussion than whether she should still be pumping.", "YTA. If you would have just been patient for 15 minutes, you could have had a nice time. She can't drink the wine right before pumping, you know.", "ESH - You could've been more sensitive. Breast feeding isn't as easy as it seems, and it can be a real struggle. Lactation nurses and general media make it seem like if you can't nurse/feed breastmilk you're doing subpar foods, i.e. \"breast is best.\" It is really stressful and overwhelming. With pumping you really have to stick with a consistent routine as it's not as effective as the baby nursing. Your supply can be affected really easily. Stress doesn't help either. \n\nBut it sounds like your wife is going through a lot and maybe needs to talk with her doctor about Postpartum Depression and Anxiety.

You both need therapy at this point.", "YTA, that is in no way your decision to make. She will stop when she\u2019s ready. You being unsupportive is the worst thing you could do as it only adds to her stress. You are creating a problem, not her.", "NAH - there is so much pressure on this subject.  Emotions run high and she is being pressured to deliver for the baby.  I say take the nice road and send her some lovely messages and encourage her.

I get you were trying to have a nice time with your wife though.", "YTA.  \n\nIt sounds like she has put way too much pressure on herself but you went about it alllllll the wrong way.    I can sympathize with her a lot,  I've struggled before to feed ny baby but it was MY decision when to stop trying- no one else's (as long as baby is healthy).    You could acknowledge how much work- blood sweat and tears most likely- she has put in to feeding your child and thank her for everything she's done.  As long as the baby is still growing well, you don't need to intervene.     Maybe, once you grow up and don't resent her pumping anymore, you can ask NICELY about when *she* plans to stop- many women stop pumping at a year in the US because that's as long as we are entitled to pump breaks and if that's what she's aiming for she's almost there!  If not? Well it still won't last forever.   It ain't about you.", "NTA. I too had supply problems. Pumping was hell, and not really working anyway. At best, I could only make 25% of what she ate in a day. I\u2019m so grateful that my husband and my mother (who successfully breastfed her 3 kids) got sick of seeing me crying my eyes out at the pump and convinced me to stop pumping at 7 weeks. The mean lactating \nMoms on the web sure didn\u2019t help either.\n\nOur whole family became happier when I stopped. I had more time for my daughter, I could enjoy her more, and now she\u2019s 4, you sure can\u2019t tell amongst her friends who was formula fed and who was breast fed.\n\nFed is best, formula is nourishing food too, and breast milk is not worth destroying your life and mental health over, especially with a 10 month old baby.", "YTA.  You handled that badly.\n\nFor your next kid, look into Motilium/Domperidone to increase breast milk production.", "Kindly, YTA but mostly for yelling at her. When she stops pumping needs to be up to her. She also should look into some support groups if not outright therapy. Speaking from experience, she very likely feels like she and/or her body has failed your child and this is something she can do to \"make up for it. \" Skipping a session might tank what sounds like an already not great supply. \n\n Until she can come to terms with the fact that she didn't fail, it may be very hard to let go of the pump no matter how inconvenient it is.", "ESH\n\nYou wanted some time with your wife and just be husband and wife together. The timing was bad.\n\nShe is already sensitive about the topic, having her react to your comment maybe more than she really should have.\n\nAnd this is exactly why we need to stop shoving breastfeeding down every new moms face, because some people just can't do it for one reason or another and this is what happens - shame and pain.\n\nI think your wife may benefit from some counselling.", "She\u2019s trying to provide food for your baby. YTA", "NAH. This is just really hard. I didn\u2019t produce enough milk to adequately feed my child and I felt like such a failure. I literally starved my baby before we figured out I simply couldn\u2019t make enough. And my husband forcing me to start  supplementing was the worst and best thing ever. I understand your wife. \n\nBut I also understand your needs. Relationships can get lost in those baby years but they deserve time and attention too. Not only for our spouses but for the babies to have parents with a healthy relationship. I think it\u2019s often harder for women to see that because of hormones and mothering instincts. But realistically science has pushed us past some of that. It\u2019s not unfair for you desire alone time now.", "NTA, but I feel terrible for your wife (and it's close to an ESH). The amount of pressure put on women to breast feed is heinous. Fed is best, and anyone who has contributed to her feeling like a failure because of this is a jerk. She is a bit of an A because she didn't introduce solids when she was instructed to by the doctor. It is important for the child's development, as well as for identifying allergies and intolerances. I know the recommendations differ between pediatricians, but I introduced rice cereal to both my kids at three months and orange veggies at four months. You have not mentioned your child's growth chart, but if he fell off at all or if you received a failure to thrive diagnosis, you are absolutely the A for not putting your foot down on this matter. Sometimes we moms need to swallow our pride and do what is best for the kid. Now, you mentioned supplementing with formula, so I assume the kid is ok, but still . . .", "NTA. Your words did devolve into an argument, and it sounds like you might have been venting quite a bit of built-up frustration -- but *anyone* would be frustrated in the situation you were in.\n\nThe real issue here is that your wife likely has a mental health problem, and it kind of sounds like you need to seek counseling or therapy for the two of you. Her behavior is beginning to escalate to the point of delusion, and to be honest, I'm not sure what I would do in your shoes either.", "YTA. There's so much pressure on mothers to breastfeed and nurse that when it doesn't go as planned, it's easy to get caught up in not being good enough. Mix that with post partum depression (which can last up to 2 years post birth) and it's easy to fall into the thought patterns of only being worth what you produce. I know this because I lived it.\n\nBy calling it a waste of time you went from nah to YTA territory because you know how much she values it, you know it doesn't take super long, and you know how much it means to her.\n\nAlso baby at 10months still needs breastmilk/formula even tho solids have been introduced. 12mo is the general stopping point and switch to non-human milk", "10 months is old enough to start the weaning process if it is that difficult for her and she is struggling.", "YTA. WHO and American Pediatric Academy recommending using breast milk ( if possible) until 24 months.  Introduction of food at six months.  Also with formula shortages in the US, if a person can pump and is willing to, it helps the stress of finding formula and the budget because of the cost.", "YTA you really need to educate yourself on how pumping works. She can\u2019t just stop cold turkey. When her body is telling her she needs to pump then she has to pump!! Also the milk she is pumping feeds your child. At that age, babe still needs milk.", "NTA - Your baby is already 10 months old, so none of this is about him.  Babies need breastfeeding up to 6 months only, after that the milk is just complementary because he already eats.  Therapy for your wife, investigate what leads her to have this charge about producing milk.  If it hasn't been something her mother, sisters or friends might be competing with her.\nIt's not like a months old baby is going to get sick or die from breast milk.  We're not talking about a newborn baby in the spring of 1653 or anything like that.  We already have enough technology to feed a child even if breastfeeding does not work, and as he is past the stage of exclusive breastfeeding, none of this is really necessary.\n\nLet me lay it down here to make it easier for people who did not interpret the text to understand: formula is a technology that was developed to complement or replace breastfeeding in cases where milk production is non-existent or insufficient.  works well since newborn and in their case that the baby is already fed, it would work even better since milk is no longer the main food.  The baby doesn't breastfeed, and she just hasn't stopped producing yet because she's torturing herself to pump. The baby takes a bottle, so it would be much easier if she left all these charges aside, and focused on her own well-being and the well-being of her own marriage. Get therapy. Breastfeeding doesn't have to be a dictatorship.", "Info from anyone: Doesn't it hurt if you don't pump??? I'm a guy and I couldn't imagine my chest hurting because of something like that.

A well-intentioned AH, but still the AH. \n\nI personally think the case for breastfeeding is extremely overstated (not saying there aren\u2019t benefits, but I think the benefits get grossly exaggerated vs the actual evidence). However, the pressure to breastfeed, or to provide breast milk is SO strong. I read up on all the evidence I could, and it still took me a MONTH to give myself \u201cpermission\u201d to stop. \n\nYou may very well be right that your wife would be happier if she accepted at this point that she has tried, that she kept going longer than many, got the kid through the most vulnerable early months, and at this point fed is best. But, you can\u2019t expect her to realize that right away. And in the meantime, while she is committed, she knows that skipping a session will sabotage what she\u2019s trying to do. It\u2019s a discussion to be had about the bigger picture, not to try to save a few minutes in the short term.", "I\u2019m going to go with NAH\u2026 \nI definitely think there were 100 different and better way for you to communicate that you needed to have a mental break from the stress of parenthood and wanted to focus on your marriage for a few hours. \nAnd supporting someone who is spiraling with depression and anxiety is not an easy emotional burden to carry. I can also see why you\u2019re frustrated when she continues to cling to breast feeding when it:\nA. Isn\u2019t beneficial for your child any longer and \nB. Is actively sabotaging her mental and emotional well-being. \nBut your wife definitely needs to be assessed for PPD.

I left the breast at 3 months because mom thought i struggled too much drinking from the bottle (she had no leave), opened up the hole a little bit more and I only wanted that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the same time, bruh, she can't simply stop pumping to focus on you, her breasts will hurt if they get too full with milk! My cousin had no maternity leave either and was in pain in the end of her shift. And that will go on for as long as needed. Maybe six months. Maybe two years.", "She clearly needs therapy. I can totally relate to her because I have a 9 month old baby, and I tried the first 3 weeks but I was just not producing enough. So I gave up. My concern was to feed my baby even thru formula. It did sting a little that I wasn\u2019t able to produce breast milk but I moved on. So idk maybe she just need special therapy maybe she has PPD or something.", "NAH\n\nOP, your wife is in a bad place mentally and you absolutely need to be there for her. \n\nOne thing I said to my daughter the other day that I think applies here: I am trying to help, but I don't know the right words. \n\nOp, I was in a similar place as your wife 15 years ago. I was all gung-go about breastfeeding. Breast is best, yadda yadda yadda. \n\nIt was so, so hard. My son had reflux. Colic. Infantile anorexia. He was eventually diagnosed with a chronic illness. It took years to figure it out and get him properly treated but he is finally HEALTHY. \n\nIn the meanwhile, breastfeeding simply didn't work. \n\nFormula saved my son's life, 100%. My only regret (well, besides not being psychic) is that I didn't start him on formula sooner. Because Breast is best, right? If it wasn't working, it was clearly MY fault. My baby deserved the best; I just had to TRY HARDER. What kind of mother wouldn't keep trying for her baby?\n\nIn retrospect, the breastfeeding support communities I was in were toxic. Not overtly, most of the time.  But they weren't addressing what was actually best for babies. They were set up to be supportive of breastfeeding, not moms or babies.\n\nThe most important thing is that baby is fed and healthy. If baby is fed and healthy, then your wife is 100% a good mom, no matter where the food comes from. You could feed him penguin milk and as long as he was still healthy, you'd be good parents.\n\n People on this sub jumps to \"you need therapy\" very quickly. I have no idea where she'd find time with a job and a baby and pumping. So that leaves you, OP. It's your job to support your wife and make it clear to her that she's a great mom (no matter what she choses) and that there is no one right way to be a mom or raise babies. Make sure she is surrounded by supportive people and supportive messaging. Be careful with online parenting groups; they can be really toxic and judgmental.\n\nBTW, all of the studies on the outcomes of breast vs bottle feeding are confounded to heck; nutrition studies are generally trash, these included. Your baby is old enough to be eating a varied diet where a single nutrition source is no longer make or break. \n\nYou may want to broach the subject of toddler food in general, because it would be very reasonable to stop pumping at a year. That might let her feel like she has accomplished her goal and give her an emotionally satisfying resolution. And for you, it's only two months. But either way, be supportive. \n\nFeel free to DM me. I wish you both the best of luck.", "NTA, I believe she is struggling with PPD.", "NTA, but you both need therapy stat. We need to figure out why wife insists that she must continue to breastfeed when the baby is now on solids, has formula, and has already gone above and beyond to make sure baby has had some breastmilk for those early months. She did it. She should be proud and she should move on. \n\nBoth of you must commit to firm boundaries around child rearing that allow for things like valentines days without kids. It\u2019s like putting on your own oxygen mask before putting on your kids\u2019\u2014your kids are the second priority after your family overall and your relationship\u2014people always think it\u2019s the other way around but that\u2019s the biggest lie in our culture.

No more cult of breastmilk\u2014get that baby fed however makes sense and make sure you\u2019re leaving enough time for each other.", "This is not about the pumping this is about a mom feeling like a failure for not being able to breastfeed.  I cannot even fathom the kind of feelings she has to be going through right now to say words like that. \n\nShe needs to talk to someone, and YOU NEED to make sure that they will help her and not make her feel bad for not being able to breastfeed. There are plenty of women out there who still believe that anything other than breastfeeding is blasphemy. Make sure to protect your wife from those people and make sure she understands that this isn't about how much milk she can pump out, she's amazing for just bringing a life into the world and you couldn't be happier for your family. She needs reassurance and understanding and therapy. She needs someone to talk to.", "NAH. \n\nYou're not in the wrong for your feelings. Breastfeeding is hard for the father's as well as the mother's and when the journey isn't smooth and there's nothing you can do as a father in an already helpless situation emotions are going to run high. \n\nBut your wife is clearly suffering emotionally with her breastfeeding journey being less than ideal, there's alot of social pressure to get everything right and a lot of perfect imagery to contend with too. \n\nYou both need to be kid to each other and show yourselves some grace. I would suggest your wife also talks to someone as she is clearly struggling to reconcile her journey to her expectations.", "Your poor wife.   I breastfed 3 kids with no problems.  I was lucky.   But my SIL, who wanted to breastfeed, had a girl who just couldn't latch.   Your wife is already struggling with this, and then you jump all over her.

It was her lunch break too, did you expect her to do the pumping before you got there, in her work time?", "NTA. She seems to have a weird obsession with pumping. My daughter was formula fed, she is on the honor roll and is in gifted & talented. Yeah breast is best or whatever but it's not going to handicap your child and make them stupid. It's okay for her to supplement formula and she needs to understand that.", "This is the answer. OP, you and your wife should have been in therapy when she started struggling emotionally when she was having issues nursing.\nI hope you both get the help you need.", "100% this is the answer.", "Honestly, it depends. If you have a good supply, it can hurt a lot. If you don\u2019t have a good supply, it might not hurt at all. My supply was always horrible and I never made it past 6 months. I pumped and everything. My kids stopped on their own and I never had any pain.", "It's not about the pumping, though. It's about how they're adjusting to parenting as individuals and a couple.", "I agree, I struggled with supply issues at first and latching as well, and though I was able to nurse, I had to supplement for a month in the beginning and then once I returned to work and over time my supply started decreasing...and it would break me every time, it was MY pressure, not societies, that's what I wanted to do and felt was best.  And yes, you struggle with self-worth about it.  I would also get teary, upset when my supply would dwindle, I pumped at work, and would bf mornings and evenings, but by 10 months when babies start eating more solids, you will actually stop producing as much as the baby doesn't rely solely on bm anymore.  And honestly, missing one pumping session 10 months in will not ruin your supply or cause mastitis.  Your request wasn't unreasonable but your delivery was trash, kwim?   \n\nI get your frustration, but what you said was harsh and insensitive, my ex was this way, didn't support me and I honestly can say I gave up before I wanted to as he would always throw what a 'waste' of time and effort it was, I was able to get close to the year mark though both times.  Support her, and see what happens, at the 12 month mark a lot of us feel a lot better about stopping.  But truly, at 10 months they just aren't bf as much, and it's expected for the supply to start diminishing/waning, I think at that point I had already stopped pumping during the day and only bf am/pm, did solids with water and supplemented with formula during the day.  I was guilt ridden for a bit, but honestly was relieved to stop the hard work and daily stress of not producing enough causing me overwhelming frustration.   \n\nIf it's that much of a problem, affecting her mental health, then I think you can address it with her in a productive manner, and recognize her efforts, but how would she feel about stopping...my body was able to adjust to the new 'schedule' by producing when I BF only, and if I had a low supply that evening, I would supplement.  She's done fantastic to go this long!!  \n\nParents mess up, the pressure on new parents is a real thing, so be kind to yourselves when you mess up, apologize and do better.", "She can, as long as in moderation, in fact a glass of wine often would help me relax more and let-down was quicker.", "Fenugreek was the name of the game in my day, that and o'douls beer.

Food therapy is not fun.", "When the divorce happens.. I've never understood  why \" lactation consultants \" shove breast feeding down women's throats. I watched it happen when I had my kids * mine were formula fed* when my grandson was born and I had to have the woman fired due to making my step daughter feel horrible because she couldn't breast feed.  A fed child is a healthy child no matter how the child is fed. It needs to stop. Women run their mental health and relationships  down to nothing because they are made to feel less than because they give formula. It's wrong.", "The same way she finds time to do the other million things that have to get done. It isn't easy, but mental health, and the health of the marriage, are necessary to take care of.", "This right here. I had to have the LC who came in my step daughters room fired. She had my daughter in tears because she couldn't breast feed.  I believe a fed child is a healthy child... no matter how the child is fed.", "My boss brought her own formula bottles to the hospital for her induction. She wasn't playing.", "It's actually quite common to have latching problems, but it's everyone's decision whether to continue to try or not, personally for me stopping was not an option, I went through supply issues, engorgement, cracked and bleeding nipples, you name it, but hell or high water it was important to ME to bf, though I recognize others don't share those feelings.  Do I lowkey judge it privately? Yeah,  but let's be real, we all judge others in some way, mothers are particularly good at this nasty skill lol. \n\nI was greatly disappointed my SD wouldn't even ATTEMPT, she straight up said she didn't want to deal with possible supply issues or take out her nipple piercings, yep, I judged her between myself/husband, but to her I simply said I really wish you re-consider, and that I was in agreement with her mom/godmother that why not at least try it?  Explained the importance of colostrum or even a few days of mothers antibodies.  She never did, we accepted it, but it's not wrong to encourage young mothers either IMO.  When he approached 4-5 months she on her own started feeling horrible regret about her choice and outright said she wished we would have pushed her more (ummm, we did as much as possible w/out being aholes)  she struggled with it so much she considered inducing lactation at that point, which I told her we would support her and help her with information or a lactation consult, etc.  She ended up not doing that, but still has mentioned she regrets it.  \n\nThe reason was her baby had really bad intolerance to most every formula they tried and continued having bad stomach issues, then ear infections, he's also lactose intolerant so now he's over a year and can't have milk...he's now facing possibly getting ear tubes, as various rounds of antibiotics/steroids have not helped him.  Would bf have mitigated some of this, probably, but that's also something that doesn't happen with every kid, fed is good, but the science does back that bf IS best.", "You want her to not have to think about her mom responsibilities. Talk about having ZERO understanding of the mental load of being a parent.  Do you help? Do you take on any parenting mental load.", "With respect, she can\u2019t just turn off the mom switch and turn on the fun carefree wife switch. The pumping will be over soon.

It can be very discouraging if your breastfeeding is not going well. \n\nThat type of group is not for people suffering from PPD. That\u2019s completely different. She needs professional psychiatric and psychological help. Post paradigm depression can occur at any time within the first year of birth, and after any birth.

In some things, guilt can be society or self-induced, it's not always others.  I can admit that often those that are fanatics about it can be either a total turn off to some moms, and others will laud them with the continued help and encouragement being key in their success.  It all varies", "I felt so harassed by the midwives at the hospital I discharged against medical advice the second day after my c section.  First baby, no help except hubby and I still felt 1000 times more relaxed at home without someone coming into my room every 30 mins harping at me to pump.  It was so stressful that I was about to give up breastfeeding even though I could do it.  I persisted until my son self weaned but it had nothing to do with those intrusive midwives and nurses", "This is so true!

With my 2nd (he was early), the lactation consultant offered the pump to help speed up the process of milk coming in, I was so grateful because it actually helped a lot, within 24 hrs, and it saved me a ton of stress/anxiety for a few days while recovering from birth.  What a godsend....I wished they would have offered the 1st time.", "Yes, but 'busybody strangers' can often be close family, and IME young/new mothers can absolutely use the experience, wisdom, guidance and advice of their moms, grandmas, aunts, older close family that can point the benefits or encourage them through difficult times.

I grew up in a country that formula was almost non-existent, bf was 100pct the norm and in pubic, nobody even hid in bathrooms for it either ;)   n fact I didn't even know about formula till I moved back to the US in my early 20's.  My mom says that there were friends she had that had to use formula, it was rare, expensive and completely opposite to bf in public, normally in private, as they would feel judged, but that it was rare, of the women she knew of child-bearing age, only 1-2 ever went that route.  \n\nI had rarely seen an infant under a year old with a bottle, ever.", "Before having our son my wife and I clearly discussed our expectations for managing our home, our marriage and our children.

I have never been militant in my approach, but I have no regrets about strongly encouraging and outlining the risk/benefits of those choices, then if they make a choice, make an educated one.  My SD had agreed to do a class/consult that discussed all this, and then no-showed.  In her regret about not even trying, she did admit that had she had all the info she later gathered when her kid was facing constant stomach problems and ear infections, and truly understood the risk/reward she would have chosen differently.  \n\nAgain, I agree everyone can make that choice and has their reasons, but I disagree that encouraging the next generation of moms to breastfeed is  a bad thing.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2812877/", "Because it\u2019s terrible advice.
