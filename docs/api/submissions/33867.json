She said that if I can\u2019t even do that, I shouldn\u2019t be a parent.

Child support was due to start last December, and rights were terminated in March of this year, without a dime of child support being paid. \n-He agreed to the schedule for visitation, but never set it up.

Let's start with your sister saying that if you'd been a better parent, your ex wouldn't have been abusive.  I very much hope that you don't need strangers on reddit to tell you how flagrantly wrong this is.  I don't need to hear another word to know that the abuse was NOT your fault.  Your sister is engaging in classic, wrong-headed victim-blaming.  If she is of normal intelligence, she knows this.\n\n2.) Let's move on to your sister saying you're a bad mom for keeping your child from her abusive father.  In the first place, he instigated a termination of parental rights.  He didn't set up supervised visitation.  That's on him.  Second, keeping a baby away from an abuser makes you a good mother, not a bad mother.  (Again, victim-blaming.)\n\n3.) If your mom didn't want to care for your child, I assure you, she'd let you know.  It's likely that she adores her grand-baby and thanks God she can be there to support you and your child.  (Jealous sister, anyone?)  \n\n4.) The physical arrangements with your mom.  You drop your child off early because you go to work long hours to support your child.  You're doing everything right.  As for the hair, big f'ing deal.  Your mom probably relishes the special grandma moment when she gets to do up her grandchild's hair, just as she did her daughters' hair.  As for breakfast, again, so what?\n\n5.) You are making the best of a very challenging situation.  Your sister is making it harder for you and trying to undermine you. ( I deeply hope that at some point you'll be up for a better paying job with shorter hours, or able to get yourself some training/further ed that allows you to do that.  But that is neither here nor there.)\n\n6.) I would suggest that your sister's behavior shows her to be very jealous, very hostile to you, and very ignorant about many many things including abuse.  I would further suggest that what she said was unforgiveable without a sincere and profound apology.  (And even if that happens, if I were you, I'd be LC until she proved herself worthy of your time.)  Until that happens, I would go NC.

As children it's our responsibility to ensure we never take advantage of the emotional leverage we hold over our parents.

Parents, even if overwhelmed and at breaking point (which I'm not saying OPs mother is at) will often still not discuss the situation with their children due to a range of factors including feelings of obligation, wanting to be of assistance, not wanting to overburden their child so instead they overburden themselves etc. Most parents see their kids doing it tough (and a single mum at 22 working 60hrs is tough) and want to help even when sometimes its not in their best interest, as the person receiving the help you always need to think about the best interest of the one providing it because they may not be prioritising their own interests.\n\nAs for the hair, I'm sure there's a dozen reasons why the toddler prefers grandma to do it, but the toddler shouldn't get a vote. This should be about what is reasonable and sustainable.

We all know why he originally pushed for custody don't be gross.\n\nHe's an abuser. And having the kid would mean a line that he could dangle over OP and force her back in line.
