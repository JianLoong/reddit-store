A bit of reasoning behind my decision before you all jump on the bitter baby mother train. Since my daughter was born he's been no help at all I was 18 and he was 20. I was still in high-school (yes I graduated and even graduated medical school last year) he was working at the time while I finished school since he was already out and had no plans to further his education.\n\n A few things he's done in the 1st year of her life that puts him on the terrible father train we were running low on baby formula and I asked him could he pick some up he left was gone for hours and came to find out he spent his money on a new tattoo, so I had to ask my mother for help and don't misunderstand she is a great grandmother does any and everything for her but she did not like my child's father which is  completely understandable. He would never watch her and spend days at a time away in her 1st year of life. Even going as far as to lie about still working when he was fired months ago just did not want his daughter.\n\nAfter she turned one he got her ONE hand full of times from age 1 to 3 after that he hardly even saw her let alone got her. \n\nHer fifth birthday was the last time he saw her. He was supposed to had seen her prior to pick her up for his other 2 daughters birthday all his kids (3 girls) were born in April mine being the oldest, but once again he got her hopes up to let her down and the excuse was he was out running errands until late at night and getting my daughter a birthday gift which was quickly discovered to be a lie.\n\nThe day of her 5th birthday everyone had gotten her great gifts. to us it was a milestone so we went all out. My fiance which I should have mentioned sooner has been in her life since she was 2 years old and we gifted her some dolls and a princess jeep powerwheel and he had the nerve to gift her a gift bag with candy and $10 in it which is how I discovered his lie about getting her a gift but once again he doesn't care how it affects her. \n\nThat was the last time he saw her it's been almost 3 years, April 11th makes 3 years since he has seen her and in my state if a parent goes 6 months for ages new to 3 and 1 year for ages 4 and up their parental rights can be taken if someone petitions for it. \n\nI'm doing this to protect my child because her dad is on the birth certificate my fiance is the only real dad she has ever known and he expressed that if anything ever happened to me he would fully parent her but with her birth dad being out there they may go to him first which means a whole court and custody issues and I don't want to put my daughter or fiance through any of that. Because I know who I want her to go to.", "created_utc": 1676674737, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11508df/aita_for_asking_my_child_father_to_give_up_his/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This decision seems well-thought-out and based on consideration for what's best for your child. NTA.", "NTA, why would you be an AH for asking? He might happily agree.", "NTA- make sure you write up a will with what your wishes are for your kid.  If you want your fiance to adopt her, then do the court thing.   I'm surprised you did not take your kids dad to court to get child support.", "No ma'am. You are NTA. You are protecting your daughter.

The biological father has shown no interest and apparently is not on a plan to pay child support as you never mention this.\n\nThat is the only thing to consider, I guess, is whether there will be any regrets that you cannot get child support from him as once you relinquish his parenting rights, that goes too.  It doesn't sound like he could be counted on paying child support anyway, however, so I think your reasons make a lot of sense.\n\nBest of luck.", "NTA\n\nNot only are you not the asshole, but you should clean this up for your own sanity. He might one day randomly decide he wants to start exerting parental authority, which may still be legally his to assert, and that could cause a lot of turmoil for your whole family. Consider these legal expenses to be an insurance policy against the possibility that he could cause chaos at some point if he wanted to.\n\nThat all said, that\u2019s still your kid\u2019s dad, so I hope that if he does turn his act around and gets even marginally better, he should still get more chances.

Congratulations on getting an education. Don't let anyone make you feel bad for being a young mom. You seem to be doing a great job.", "NTA - time to take care of it legally.  He's not supporting the child, you should have taken him to court years ago.  The formulas are pretty simple and his wages will be garnished for child support and sent to you (assuming you're in the US).\n\nPerhaps stop calling him a father and more accurately use sperm donor.", "NTA. He\u2019s clearly a dead beat. The sooner you get rid of him the better. If he wanted to be there for his daughter, he would of been from day 1. He\u2019s had 8 years. His loss.", "NTA", "NTA. Congratulations on med school, that's huge. You need to put this to rest, legally. Unfortunately that means court. That is your safest way to deal with this and you should hit him for back and future child support. It's a legal obligation he is shirking.", "NTA but your daughter is aware this is her father and may blame you for trying to sever the relationship. And he is not agreeing to it, so that means a court battle and lawyers costs. Even abandonment is hard to prove if he is not consenting, but maybe you could take him to court to force him to pay child support because hey presto, a lot of men (sorry it's mostly men) instantly want more visitation... Get him under the umbrella of the court, which it sounds like maybe has not happened yet, and down the road it may be easier to go for TPR. Either way you need to consult a lawyer and get your daughter into therapy.", "NTA. I\u2019ve witnessed firsthand the damage bitter mothers can do to their children and ex. I\u2019ve seen men desperately try to fight for their rights in court. Every cent they have is spent on child support and court costs. Trying to do the right thing, telling the truth while the mothers lie, withhold the child on dad\u2019s custody time, pretend they got the dates and locations wrong and get away with it all because family court favours the mother. Your daughter\u2019s sperm donor has done none of these things. This is one of those scenarios where he really isn\u2019t a father and hasn\u2019t ever been. You just want to make it formal.", "Nta. One of my niece's half siblings got adopted by a very wonderful guy that was always there for her. Her bio dad was never her real dad but she did get to see her siblings and form a bind which is nice. Hopefully the bio dad just gives up quickly. He doesn't have a leg to stand on.", "NTA Why would you be? As things stand your fiance and child could go through a whole lot of trouble if something happened to you.", "NTA", "NTA. You should do this. For that very reason. It\u2019s a good reason.", "He will become very interested in being her daddy when she is an adult and doing well in life.", "What does your daughter want? Doesn't matter what you or your fiance and certainly not Reddit it boils down to what she wants.", "NTA that\u2019s terrible and good for you protecting your kiddo.", "op=NTA \n\nbased on what you have written, you are doing what is best for your child.", "NTA. But you also need to go to court and ask for child support", "Nta. You're doing the right thing. My father was in and out. It did more damage than had he been absent.", "NTA however in most states, he cannot legally give up his rights unless there is a pending adoption.", "NTA He doesn't seem to want to be in her life so he WBTAH if he doesn't give up his parental rights.", "NTA\nHe\u2019s not inhabiting the role of \u2018parent\u2019 so why should he have the parental oversight that someone else could be utilising.", "NTA. Carrot or stick. If he refuses to give up parental rights, you will file for court mandated child support. That should motivate him a little.", "NTA. You\u2019re doing this for really solid, important reasons. Your fianc\u00e9e is right, if anything were to happen to you it would be a nightmare for him to keep your daughter in her loving family, they\u2019d both be entirely at the mercy of a dead beat and the court system. \n\nIs it also possible for you to make a will detailing your custody wishes so that her dad would have to go to court himself before he could take custody in the case of your passing?", "NTA\n\nI wouldn\u2019t even ask him if the court states you can petition it. Asking him gives him a chance to \u2018reappear\u2019 for a few days and set your back to square one.", "I don\u2019t think YTA but you really need to stop looking down on him. Maybe with three kids he couldn\u2019t afford more than  $10 gift. I\u2019m betting your real worry is that he\u2019ll go for child support from you now that you\u2019re a high earner. You\u2019re not wrong to try to protect your financial interest but don\u2019t say it\u2019s for your daughter. She benefits from any amount of contact with her dad. It\u2019s for your peace of mind.", "I asked him to and he begged me not to. Then asked could he speak to her just to have a short phone call and reghoust her so I'm back to picking up the pieces.", "Sometimes filing/enforcing a child support order is a good motivator for him to finally do the right thing and give up his parental rights.", "My daughter has abandonment issues and thinks she is not good enough. And I find it unbelievable that a 7 y/o can express how much she thinks no one wants her even though me , my fiance,  and her grandparents show her all the time how much she is loved and wanted but her only thought is why her 'dad' doesn't see her and I just don't have the answer. It's touchy for me when she starts this because idk what to say.", "I asked him funny enough would he be willing to give them up and he begged me not to do this to him and that he was going to do better. He asked could he talk to her I let them talk just for him to tell her that he was going to the store and he would call back in a bit. He never called back or answered any of my messages afterwards about just him just letting her go. I hate I allowed him to get another chance to hurt her. It broke me all over again to see her upset.", "When I reached out to him he assumed immediately that I was doing all this to put him on child support when I could Carr less about his money. I even told him stripping his rights would save him from that \"nightmare\" because it seems to be all he cares about. I more financially well off then him so I find it Laughable.", "Thanks!. He thought I was doing all this for child support initially but I make more then him and value my daughter and my peace of mind over having him hurt her at every turn and his little check any day.", "People may feel it's immoral of me to strip a 'father' of his right. It's honestly laughable.", "I'm thinking about seeing is it possible to serve someone with a petition like this.", "He doesn't want them stripped. I brought it up to him and he refused but still also is okay with being inactive. I'm going to discuss this with a lawyer to see if I can just cleanly get them stripped.", "The gift anecdote helps emphasize that even when he seems to be putting in effort, he really isn\u2019t. It speaks to his character beyond just \u201cdeadbeat\u201d.", "I meantion the gift he gave her to point out the extent of his lie not to get her. He didn't get a gift at all he gave her $10 in cash He was the one who told me he was out shopping getting her a gift which was quickly discovered to be a lie. And he can't put me on child support I've been supporting the child since birth he's never really spent anything on her. He's never even gotten her a Christmas gift never wished her a merry Christmas in fact and hasn't wished her a happy birthday in 2 years. My main and only thought is my daughter peace of mind we grew up together so I won't allow anyone to hurt her.", "Then time to play hardball and go to court to have them removed. I hope you are able to show the pattern of abandonment and selfish behavior and the court doesn't give you too much runaround.", "Definitely, if you haven't filed for support OP you should.", "She doesn\u2019t have an answer as to why her bio dad won\u2019t see her.  So as all children do, she makes up a reason.  she believes that she has done something wrong to cause him to leave.  She is afraid that you and fianc\u00e9 and grandparents will also leave her.  It doesn\u2019t matter how much you tell her she is loved.  He tells her that and then ghosts her.  She is a child and can\u2019t comprehend adult motivations.\n\nShe needs therapy ASAP.  And you need to stop being nice to your ex.  His ghosting is causing your child to have abandonment issues and if you don\u2019t get this dealt with legally and through therapy, she will never be able to form normal attachments when she gets older.  No more chances for him.  He is causing your daughter harm every time he is in contact with her.  Get a lawyer and the rights terminated.", "I\u2019d say answer in a way your child can understand. Your daddy has children with different mommies so he has to spend time with other kids too and he\u2019s not good at taking time to do this because he works but he loves her.", "Told my son some people are not build to be parent. That he,s perfect, that his dad loves him very much but is not able to take care of him, that he is still like a kid in his head and not ready to be a dad. That he was made with love, but his dad lack the ability and as he keep hurting us with empty promises, better be happy with our Friends and family. Better help her put words on what she feels, even if it hurts. Tell her you're sorry, you realised too late it wasn't dad material but it's not her fault ? Wishing you the best", "Talk to a lawyer, see what you can do.  Maybe the lawyer will agree that the bio dad has two choices:\n\n1.\tGive up his parental rights. \n2.\tPay child support. (And maybe that will persuade him.)", "Document this! Keep a diary of every occurrence of his ghosting her, make a note of the observed psychological harm it has done her. It will help in court.", "I'd have just done it to make him accountable more.  No loss to anyone with him having his rights taken away.", "He\u2019s a sperm donor not a father. Your fianc\u00e9 is a father. Don\u2019t you\u2019re completely in the right anybody in your life who disagrees should be cut out.", "A fathers right is earned by actions", "Ok well NTA. He has forfeited his parental rights.", "I\u2019m sure you\u2019re wrong about the child support.

You should probably check in your state.", "Yeah but she\u2019s going to earn more than him. She mentioned medical school. She\u2019s risking poking the sleeping bear. She could end up paying him.", "Why exactly would a deadbeat that has barely been in the child\u2019s life get custody? And he\u2019s made it clear he isn\u2019t interested in having custody, or any meaningful relationship, with OPs child. He contributes nothing to his child\u2019s life, other than constant disappointment. \n\nAnd no, children don\u2019t benefit from \u201cany  amount of contact\u201d. They benefit from routine and consistent contact with a parent they can trust and rely on. This guy brings nothing positive to that child\u2019s life and OP is absolutely doing the right thing by cutting those cords and making sure her child stays with the only consistent father she has ever known if something happens to OP.\n\nOP absolutely SHOULD look down on the deadbeat liar, as should every single other person on the planet. \n\nWhy are you so bent on defending a deadbeat? Do you see yourself in him?", "Lmao child support is for the person supporting the child. He can\u2019t get child support if he\u2019s not around. Pls get the facts straight.", "Fair point. Starting point is talking to a lawyer."]}
