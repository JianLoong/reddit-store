Totally unfair of her", "Smile and nod, then think of ways to change the subject.  I do this often when I'm forced to be around toxic people - and I'm sorry, they sound toxic.   Seems MIL conveniently lowers her expectations for SIL while raising her expectations of your family.  It's disrespectful for MIL to even suggest that you all cut things out of your own budget to give to SIL. I would chose my words wisely if you're going to say you're tired of hearing about SIL - God forbid if you say something wrong, then it's more criticism coming your way.  I'm more of a change the subject - maybe MIL will pick up on it eventually.  NTA  Good luck!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust tell MIL none of this concerns you in any way, and have a lot less contact with here.", "NTA. Listening to someone cataloging another persons woes, many of which seem to be of their own making, gets old very quickly. And if the whole pupose is guilt tripping you into giving money towards your SILs upkeep, I understand it very well. You are under no obligation to support them financially.", ">it\u2019s not actually my life I\u2019m complaining about rather just having to hear about someone else\u2019s.\n\nYWBTA if you make this into some big deal.  Presumably your in-laws are talking about SIL to your husband not just you, and that's a normal conversation to have even though it may be tiresome to listen to.\n\nNo one's asked for money for a year (and your spouse wisely didn't give it then anyway), so SIL's life isn't actually affecting you. Quit focusing so much on her life, and tune out the discussion you aren't interested in or change the topic.  It's not that hard.", "So it sounds to me you're basically wanting to ask your in laws not to tell you of any family updates. Honestly it puts this in a position where they are feeling they have to monitor/filter normal conversation to simply not mention your SIL. Ultimately I feel like this is just about the issue with SIL, so YTA. \n\nIf it were a case you felt this was gossiping and something you wouldn't want to hear about anyone in the family that would be a different story and I don't think it would be out of the question to tell your in laws \"it's not nice to talk about people like this behind their backs\" \nBut that doesn't sound like that's what's happening here. \n\nI think it's totally ok to tell them they aren't welcome to comment on your finances or how you spend it.", "YWBTA\u2026unless MIL starts asking more for handouts. I get that families do that sometimes, but in the SIL case she\u2019s clearly making bad financial decisions while she\u2019s having money problems. Nobody should subsidize her inability to live within her means. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people who are barely hanging on pile up loans for house/car/truck, get multiple pets, have lots of kids, and then start asking people they know whom they know have money for handouts. \n\nSo save it\u2026unless MIL or someone else tries to make it your problem. Then, at that point, you\u2019re involved and can tell her your two cents. Also don\u2019t pay them anything!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
