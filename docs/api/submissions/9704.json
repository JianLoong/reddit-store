It\u2019s a serious safety issue (the school is located in the town centre). \n\nOne day, I sent kids with a note letting parents know that they\u2019re expected to collect their kids or they will be called and expected to collect their children and the kids won\u2019t be released on their own.\n\nAfter the next class, only one parent came and was mad they had to come (seriously? It\u2019s your child!). So I waited with the kids for 30 minutes. The kids were restless and kept telling me it\u2019s fine to let them go to which I refused, they\u2019re literally children. \n\nI started calling parents and many told me to let the kids go. I told them that absolutely not and they had to come and collect their kids. Eventually, they all did within 2 hours but only 2 children came to my next class and now the school director sent me an email to have a meeting with me.\n\nI ranted to another teacher (the actual English teacher at the school) and she virtually told me I was a crazy asshole because kids here walk and take busses all the time and I was way out of line.\n\nI told her I didn\u2019t think so but she said that parents are pissed off. And sure enough, my email is filled with mail from angry parents. I\u2019m dreading opening them after the first few.\n\nI genuinely only care about safety of the kids but everyone is acting like I am the asshole.

At 10, I could already take public transit in both cities I grew up in, one American and one European.

Americans are so terrified of \"stranger danger\" that they don't give their kids enough \"heads up\" about Uncle Johnny or Aunt Ethel.", "That's the same in Europe.\n\nThough I want to add siblings on the abuser list. They're not talked about at all and that kind of abuse is often not taken seriously when it becomes known to happen", "Oh yes, it happens.  Probably more often than we think.  I remember a line by Jodie Foster in The Silence of the Lambs when she is talking about the mind of the murderer they are looking for.\n\n\"He covets what he sees every day.\" \n\nAbusers have access to people in their own household and the households of their friends and other relations.", "YTA here OP and let me guess you are Filipina, when everyone assumes you are American. You should have ask first the head teacher instead of holding the kids going back home, if I were the parent I would be pissed too. We were living in a safe city, I have 7 and 9 years old who goes back home from school, just because It's a custom in your own country, doesn't mean it's applicable in the place you are working for.", "I agree with everything you said except for the fact I doubt OP is American (\"centre\").", "Yup. Even in areas in the US that have a good amount of crime or lots of traffic/major roadways, kids that age frequently walk home. And then come back to school the next day, not even slightly dead.", "op is likely from a country w/o a gun problem & w/free healthcare. op isnt american. americans say center & pick up the kids, not centre & collect the kids. also american children that age walk home from school alone", "OP isn\u2019t enacting an American tradition. Lots of American kids walk home from school.", "She also said \u201ccollect\u201d the kids. My money is on British or Australian.", "My parents would have told me to ignore Ms. Self-righteous here and just leave, as well as to do everything I could if she tried to physically detain me. Everything meaning screaming, fighting, and/or running away. The same as if a stranger tried to grab me.", "Because obviously we Americans are the only ones that move elsewhere and complain.", "In the UK at least, we have secondary school from 11-16 (years 7-11). People do sixth form/college or an apprenticeship from 16-18 (years 12 and 13). So secondary is effectively high school. I know some secondary schools here are called high schools too.", "Right. Collecting their kids is not only unnecessary but impossible.", "People are so quick to make generalizations about \u201cAmericans\u201d for some reason \u2014 much more so than about people from any other country. This is really just a human thing; humans tend to think they know better than everyone else (there\u2019s a generalization that requires no national identification \u2014 most don\u2019t!)", "They do very much have 3 and 4 year olds on that show often. They make it seem like the kids have no idea they're on television and the camera people are all disguised as like, the cable guy or whatever. The people at the shops have clearly been clued in, though they don't appear to tell the kids what to do judging by how often the kids buy the wrong thing or sit down in a field to do nothing. \ud83d\ude02  But of course that could all be TV magic.", "According to wikipedia, American High School is equivalent to year 10-13 in the English system. So calling secondary school \"high school\" is a bit of a stretch. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_in_the_United_States#Typical_American_high_school", "Ain't that the truth - by someone you knew. Good on you for keeping yourself safe, and for teaching your kids how to do so also.", "Watched the episode where a 3 year old was sent home to make juice and he just played around the house for like an hour first lol\n\nI enjoyed it because that's exactly how I'd expect 3 year olds to be"]}
