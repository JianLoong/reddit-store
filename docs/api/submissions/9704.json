It\u2019s a serious safety issue (the school is located in the town centre). \n\nOne day, I sent kids with a note letting parents know that they\u2019re expected to collect their kids or they will be called and expected to collect their children and the kids won\u2019t be released on their own.\n\nAfter the next class, only one parent came and was mad they had to come (seriously? It\u2019s your child!). So I waited with the kids for 30 minutes. The kids were restless and kept telling me it\u2019s fine to let them go to which I refused, they\u2019re literally children. \n\nI started calling parents and many told me to let the kids go. I told them that absolutely not and they had to come and collect their kids. Eventually, they all did within 2 hours but only 2 children came to my next class and now the school director sent me an email to have a meeting with me.\n\nI ranted to another teacher (the actual English teacher at the school) and she virtually told me I was a crazy asshole because kids here walk and take busses all the time and I was way out of line.\n\nI told her I didn\u2019t think so but she said that parents are pissed off. And sure enough, my email is filled with mail from angry parents. I\u2019m dreading opening them after the first few.\n\nI genuinely only care about safety of the kids but everyone is acting like I am the asshole.

At 10, I could already take public transit in both cities I grew up in, one American and one European.
