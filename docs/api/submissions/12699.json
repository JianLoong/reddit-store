NTA", "NTA\nI am still very cautious about Covid but don\u2019t expect others to cater to me. I just wear a mask. Your aunt is wrong. They could have asked. They could have worn masks.", "NTA,\n\nSounds like they just assumed it would be a small family thing, especially having brought kids that young.", "NTA- they probably \"had better things to do\" and just wanted an excuse to leave early.", "NTA. They could have asked.", "NTA. I doubt most people would have thought to tell guests how many would be there. They never asked. Don\u2019t see why it\u2019s a big deal.", "NTA, it was an unreasonable requirement. If your cousin was feeling insecure about the illness she was free to leave but to blame you is absurd.", "NTA.  This is not a \"you\" problem.  It's a \"them\" problem.  If this is an issue for them, they should have asked.", "NTA. Your party, your house. 100% fine for them to leave if they\u2019re uncomfortable but it isn\u2019t fair for them to get mad at you when they decide they\u2019re uncomfortable. Honestly if they were that worried they should have asked and decided not to come based on the info at hand, you don\u2019t need to disclose everything you do to everyone automatically.\n\nTo add this isn\u2019t in your post but I can understand them being uncomfortable, esp if someone is immunocompromised or around someone who is, but again ask if you\u2019re worried before making assumptions. You did nothing wrong here IMO.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s 2023. We have a vaccine, and like you said they just travelled abroad. Both of these things likely indicate to everyone that they are not being overly careful anymore (which is fine, many people aren\u2019t now). So it didn\u2019t feel necessary to disclose the number of guests. \n\nIf they\u2019d been cautious still and you knew about that, that would be a different story.", "NTA - first it\u2019s your house and your party, you can do what you want. I mean what is their expectation, that every invite or event tell them how many people are going to be there?  Excuse me krogers, how many people do you estimate will be shopping when I decide to go?\n\nSecond: while Covid is certainly still a serious disease there are many many mitigations available today. Vaccines and post infection treatments for serious infection really really limit the chances of getting very ill. If they are that concerned about infection that is their choice, they could leave quietly and not go out of their way to complain. Unless they have an autoimmune issue then in that case maybe I\u2019m the asshole.", "NTA, definitely not. I guess it's sort of understandable that your cousin's family might have different boundaries in different spaces, but at the same time, it's suspicious that your AUNT told you instead of your cousin telling you. Your cousin should have came to you directly and said something along the lines of, \"Hey, I'm really sorry but I just didn't realize there would be so many people at this party, I know we just got back from our trip in Europe, but being around so many people in an enclosed space just makes me a little bit uncomfortable, I'm just very particular about keeping my family safe with the virus so I think we are going to leave a little early.\" But the fact that she did not do this and instead had your aunt not only tell you but INSINUATE that you are an asshole? That's very passive aggressive. Toxic.", "NTA. If it\u2019s that important to someone to know, they can ask.", "NTA, don\u2019t go to a party and be upset that there are people there\u2026especially since you just went on a vacation lol. Family is also just as likely as a stranger to give you Covid\u2026", "NTA but it sounds like you ain\u2019t is in the middle and she shouldn\u2019t be. Perhaps your cousin gets social anxiety also. Why don\u2019t you reach out to your cousin and see what she says?", "NAH, except maybe the aunt who tried guilting you. Cousin's just being protective of herself and her kids, but you weren't exactly doing anything wrong", "NAH. You are allowed to invite who you want, they are allowed to be nervous around so many people in such close proximity.", "NTA. Cousin sounds like she doesn't think things through before making excuses. It's likely she just didn't want to be there but thought it would be polite to put in an appearance for your benefit. I mean, who goes on a European trip with small children and an unvaxxed spouse, *then* complains about 40+ people being at a party in honor of a family member? Sounds entitled, too.", "You're NTA. Apparently no one ever explained to your aunt or your cousin that the world does not revolve around her or her silly hypocritical concerns.", "Just going to comment this here because I\u2019m seeing it being mentioned, my cousin is vaxxed, her husband is not. The kids are vaxxed. No one immunocompromised, cousins husband didn\u2019t want to get it because he felt like he was being forced to, and didn\u2019t like that. \n\nThat\u2019s why this whole situation really doesn\u2019t make sense to me.", "NTA.\n\nMaybe during the pandemic it would've been normal to tell people how many guests are expected, but definitely not now. If they had concerns, they should've voiced them prior to the event. I also don't understand how they got on a plane with at least 30 other people in a small, enclosed space.", "NTA - but I do see a point in letting people know that there would be other people/how big the crowd would be. Even if they just got back from a trip, you don't know what their experiences were like or how avoidant they were of people (especially in Europe, which is more strict than other places). On the flip side, I feel like that is common sense; if you're throwing a birthday party and you tell people to come to your birthday party, then it's going to look like a party.   \n\n\nWhat you could do to remedy any ill will or nervous energy, is just use the OFNR (non violent communication) - \"I observed that you left the party early, which made me feel surprised. I need to know why, and I request that in the future you communicate with me before you leave\".", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So I wear the god damned mask and probably will for the foreseeable future. I also recognize that most people have moved on and that this is my problem- so I don\u2019t make a big deal out of it.
