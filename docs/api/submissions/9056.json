I admit, I usually stay up late and play video games or watch TV in the living room. Usually, it's easier to just sleep on the couch rather than go to  my bed and make noise. Especially considering that I share a bedroom with someone, and I don't want to wake them up. Plus, let's face it, sharing a room with someone sucks and I like my privacy. I usually get more privacy if I sleep in the living room because nobody's there at night.\n\nThe other day, my roommate got mad at me and said they are all sick of me sleeping there and hogging up the living room. He claims that I get mad at them if I make noise at night, even though it is a common area. That isn't true, sometimes if someone leaves for school or walks through at night I wake up and get jumpscared and shout, but that isn't me getting mad, it's just something I've always done when I get woken up. I can't help it. If someone uses the kitchen while I sleep, sometimes I groan at them if I'm really tired, but that's all. I usually just go back to sleep after.\n\nHe claims its also not fair because none of them can ever use the TV. Well, the way I see it, it's my space too that I pay for, and it's usually first come first serve. If they were already on the TV I wouldn't complain. Why don't they just use it while I'm gone at class?\n\nFinally, he claims I am making the class and whole living room stink. That isn't true, I went and smelled it and it didn't stink at all. If anything, he is the one who made the whole apartment stink because a few days ago he cleaned out our dishwasher filter, which had food in it and stunk really bad. We just were leaving the dishwasher alone, because as long as nobody opened it it wouldn't stink. But of course, he insists on using the dishwasher instead of cleaning by hand, and had to clean the filter which smelled like sulfur.
