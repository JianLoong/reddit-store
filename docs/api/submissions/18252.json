This was an unplanned pregnancy and while I wasn't in love with the idea of becoming father, especially with 50 being right around the corner, I am learning to adjust because I haven't been one to shirk away from my responsibilities in nearly 30 year nor am I the child free type who has a disdain for children.\n\nFor years I was a semi-involved fun uncle type who attended most events that my nieces and nephews had, gave out nice gifts, and had set up funds/trusts for my siblings' kids as up until now I saw them as my only heirs. I had the great fortune of being a smart man with the ability to be in the right place at the right time and became CEO. After receiving the blessings of my siblings and their spouses I gave my nieces and nephews cars, expensive trips, and college funds.\n\nIn my will I stated that my nearly million dollar life insurance policy was to be divided up equally between my siblings' kids along with the money from the sale of my main and summer home, my savings, stocks/shares would be divided up as well, and a few other smaller properties. This is something that I was always up front about as I wanted no confusion after my passing. Everyone was fine with this.\n\nNow with the pending birth of my daughter I met with my lawyer and have drawn up a new will and just like before I decided to sit everyone down and tell them about the changes. My lawyer also thought it would be a good idea to get everyone to sign a statement acknowledging that they agree to the changes. I thought so too and didn't consider it an issue. Unfortunately, I was wrong and several members of my family voiced their disappointment or outright anger at how I would be giving the majority of my assets to my daughter.\n\nThey stated that it wasn't fair how I kept leading them all to believe they could expect one thing but end up getting another \"lesser\" thing. A few of them even questioned paternity but the way they did it made it feel like it was less out of concern for me and more about trying to gate keep the money and judging Pam based off of awful stereotypes. This has put me off as the way I see it, this is my way of making sure that my daughter gets everything that she's entitled to and the best support possible to make up for the fact that she will have the misfortune of having a dad in his 60s-70s when she's still growing up.\n\nI'm currently of mind to just give my daughter 90% of my assets instead of the original 60% but I wanted to run this by a few non-biased minds as, right now, I'm still a little emotional about this and my goddaughter suggested I come here. AITA?\n\nEdit: Because someone else brought this up I just wanted to be clear about one thing and answer something else. The first is that a DNA test was already done and Pam's unborn baby is 99.99% mine, but my family doesn't know I did the test because I didn't think that it was something that I had to tell them. The second is that Pam is African-American and that's why I mentioned that my family was making awful accusations about her. Pam isn't someone who I just met and I've known her to be a trustworthy and reliable person since I met her.

Your daughter getting 60% feels about right, given the close involvement you've had with your neices and nephews. Right now, you don't know if you will have a relationship with your daughter, or if you will have one that becomes distant or estranged. You aren't in a relationship with her mother, so the stability that would provide also isn't there. The mother could be in a relationship with another guy anytime, which will change things. I'm sorry that this is happening to you. It's not easy starting out into parenthood in midlife, especially when it was not  in your plans. \n\nSo, some of the things your family are concerned about are actually valid. Are you the father? If the connection was casual, you may not have been the only person who could be the father. I'm sorry to say it, but in all honesty, not being the father might be the best outcome. \n\n\nInitially offering your family the inheritance would have taken a lot of future concerns off the table for them. They might have made plans/ dreams around this, so a part of me can see their disappointment. That disappointment combined with a sense of 'who is this woman anyway', is probably what led to the hurtful comments. \n\nWhen someone is struggling to see things from my perspective, I find it useful to ask them to advise me on the best way forward, with a 'what would you do if you were me' slant. Then I listen and let some time pass. It makes them feel heard and sometimes makes them reflect on the fairness. It doesn't always work, because people are people, but it can take the 'heat' out of it for a bit. \n\nI hope you don't lose your relationships with your family over this.", "NTA\n\nYou are correct that your daughter's future is now your priority. \n\nYou've been very generous with your nieces and nephews but it's ok to now fade that out. Continue to help with college if that was promised but only if you can comfortably financially do so.\n\nAs for percentage of assets, that's a tough one. \n\n\\-If your daughter is still a child when you pass, would you want her to continue to live in your home and have the summer home? If so, those would be passed to her (in trust) and not part of cash to be divided. \n\n\\-What about money to support those homes? \n\n\\-What is the arrangement for supporting her mother being a single parent if your daughter is still a child?\n\nThere is a lot of variables.\n\nPerhaps set aside $X money a year for each niece and nephew that you keep in an account. When it reaches a certain amount, like $20-$50K for each one, stop contributing to the account. Everything else goes to your daughter, in trust or directly.", "First off, definitely NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s you\u2019re hard work and money and you can do with it whatever you like. While I understand they can feel disappointment, they have to realise circumstances change and your own biological child (accident or not) would take precedent. \n\nI would just make it clear in will it\u2019s being left DIRECTLY and safely with child, not with Pam. I\u2019d also highly suggest you change it based on proven paternity, if that actually is a concern.", "If your family is not helping you with anything, then give it all to your daughter. My thought is, \"if you do not sign my paychecks or pay my bills, what good are you?\" this should be applied to them. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou are being incredibly kind, upfront and responsible with the whole issue. It is your money and the way you decide to dispose of it now or after your passing is a decision for you and you only. Your family is being entitled and disrespectful to you in so many levels. \n\nI would have a chat with them and let them know how their behavior is reflecting on them and our personal relationship (no mention to inheritance) if their attitude does not change, leave them the 10% and nothing else, but do not involve the money in the decision making, let the show who they really are just based on your human interaction.", "NTA \nIf you had a child 20 years ago none of them would have anything to say about it.

Most State probate code identifies children as natural beneficiaries long, long before any children of siblings.

Your nieces and nephews have trust funds, college, trips, and cars.   \n\nI think you could take another tactic with your will now.  Sit people down, tell them what you are doing, and don't ask them to agree to the changes.  Tell them you have been remarkably generous, your obligations have changed significantly and you will change your planned distribution of your estate. This is not up for discussion.

Make sure you are providing for Pam as well, at least on some level, as your family certainly will not. \n\nYou seem like a good guy.  It is sad that your family has been warped by your generosity and their expectations. They should be welcoming their new niece and cousin with open arms.", "NTA\n\nI highly recommend that you revise your will and life insurance to provide mostly for your daughter and possibly also her mother (in case you pass while your daughter is still a minor).  \n\nYour family members have proven that they are more concerned about your money than about your happiness and your growing family.\n\nYou should help your niblings to the extent that you had previously committed by continuing to contribute to their college and other reasonable expenses.  But all of your estate should go toward the care of your child.  Because if you have an estate, that means that you aren't around any longer to help provide for your child's needs.  So your estate and life insurance will be needed to help her have the life you intend for her.\n\nOn the other hand, if you pass, your niblings will still have their parents to help them.  So, they won't need your money like your daughter would.", " NTA. I'd say they've made a convincing case for your daughter getting 100% of your assets, myself.", "So they expect to come before your blood offspring? Smfh, I'd give them less. They sound so entitled and rude. I'd give them nothing", "NTA, people with no gratitude should be people with no inheritance", "NTA and it is really mind boggling that your siblings who have children do not understand how things in your life change when you create child. Please keep your daughter taken care of and leave only what you WANT to to the nieces and nephews. You have done far more for them than many other families do or are able to do. Please make this new little life your priority. Congrats and enjoy.", "NTA\n\nStop giving gifts now, cut them off and make sure your daughter and maybe Pam too get everything. \n\nYour family sounds low key racist and pretty white trash. Imagine fighting over money that isn't yours and having been given enough hand outs to start making your own fortune and still feeling entitled to someone else's.", "NTA. Give it all to your own kid.", "Info: Why would you discuss your will with your heirs? The will itself eliminates any ambiguity about your intentions. \n\nInfo: Why do you need agreement from those disinherited in your new will? It's your money. You don't need their permission to  change your estate plan.\n\nInfo: Why are you having your life insurance proceeds pass through probate?\n\nInfo: Can't you afford a decent estate attorney?", "NTA. Change the will. 100% to your daughter. What a bunch of entitled, ungrateful money hungry people.", "YTA, made false promises and let them down.

When your family members look at you, they only see dollar signs, that is all you mean to them. They are about to have a new addition to the family and are not even happy about it. They have no say in how you decide to spend your money.

Your have already put them in a place to create their own wealth (or at least not be burdened with student loan debt). Not that splitting nearly a million dollars with interest isn\u2019t chump change, but it\u2019s not what a person should be counting on as a means to live without care. Plus, unless you have significant health/genetic history that predisposes you to a middle-age death, you are likely to be around a few more decades. And last but not least, if those awful accusations were racist, be wary over and above regular wary of your sibling\u2019s potential resentment to your daughter. It does not sound promising that your choice to be an amazing uncle to your nibblings will be reciprocated by your siblings.", "If anything I'd give them the legal designated amount in order to not be considered forgotten as I do know for at least 10 years I've causally mentioned leaving my nieces and nephews things of monetary value.", "No I'm aware. I'm lawyer just advised it in order to be absolutely thorough. They even suggested other routes in case my family didn't sign. Sad to say my lawyer may have been right.", "Ironically my goddaughter, who wasn't going to inherit anything, has been the most accepting about my daughter. She's the one who suggested I come here.", "OP says he told everyone about it because he didn't want there to be any confusion, but there was absolutely nothing confusing about the earlier provisions he described.", "I'm shocked they wouldn't expect the situation to change. You now have a biological child to will your assets to. My first thought is none of your siblings planned for their kids financial futures and are now on the hook, but that is really their issue. NTA", "> I don't see why the others get anything at all.\n\nBefore my parents died they always expressed the importance of family looking out for family, and like I said before I've almost always considered my siblings' kids as my heirs as I never had any intention of having kids of my own.", "I just made an edit because you're not the first person to ask but I'll add in a couple more details. \n\nYes, Pam knows I am a man of means. We met at a work event back in 2017 and after our respective businesses concluded their work we became what my god daughter would describe as \"work friends\" and we started an exclusive physical relationship during 2020 due to the pandemic stopped and then restarted last summer. In the years I've known her Pam has always been a kind, smart, and honest woman so I trusted her when she told me that I accidentally got her pregnant.", ">If your daughter is still a child when you pass, would you want her to continue to live in your home and have the summer home?\n\nHonestly? I would still ask that the homes to be sold as I wouldn't want my daughter's trust to be depleted with the cost of upkeep and taxes and the money from the sell just be added to it.   \n\n\nPam and I have discussed it and we will be going through the courts for an official agreement with the understanding that I will already be paying a certain amount, plus our daughter will be on my health and dental insurance. I'll also foot the bill for any extracurricular activities and private school, plus a college fund. This is partly because I make more money and partly because, for now, Pam and I have agreed that she will be our daughter's primary care taker.", "I forgot what it's called but Pam wanted to do this thing where you can test your child for certain genetic defects and opted for a DNA test while she was at it before I even brought it up, so that made me confident. Plus Pam has always presented herself as a reliable and honest woman. However, I was there when they conducted the test. Her unborn child is 99.99% mine but I didn't tell my family about the test results.", ">Then write it so it's not confusing\n\nI've seen situations where that didn't help.", "I'm an American living in the United States we basically get to leave it to whoever.", "I don't my lawyer just thought it was a good idea for the sake of being thorough.", "It's not needed just an extra form of protection", "Right. He totally let them down buy buying them cars and paying for their college educations\u2026 s/", "> When your family members look at you, they only see dollar signs, that is all you mean to them.\n\nTo be fair, OP encouraged this by making sure they all knew the exact provisions in his old will, and how much he intended to leave them before he changed his mind.  Why do that unless you *want* them to see dollar signs when they look at you?", "Yeah, but that was before they showed their true colors. You could offer to give their share to the charity of their choice. They need a wake-up call.", "My BIL was just like you, except that his surprise baby was with his wife who was told she would never have children. They were in their 40s. My oldest (only at the time) went from only heir to \u201csimply\u201d godson. He\u2019s still getting the signed sports memorabilia, apparently. But none of it matters. Maybe it\u2019s because my son was younger, maybe it\u2019s because my BIL isn\u2019t as wealthy as you are. But he has a daughter now he has to take care of. Bottom line. And my kids are my responsibility. \n\nBut he\u2019s still the funcle. Always gonna be. And that\u2019s worth more to us than anything. \n\nI\u2019m sorry they see you as an inheritance first, but you never spend money, or even make plans on money, you don\u2019t have yet. Circumstances have changed. They need to adapt.", "You\u2019re NTA at all, give everything to your daughter. They\u2019re the TAs, only after your money, and not making sure that their newest family member is good through this entire process they showed you and then some who they are take it at face value, believe them", "TBF you would be very fair to point out that you have already given their inheritance in trips and college education.\n\nNTA - make a trust for your daughter. The entitlement of the family is disgraceful. Anyone would think that they would be happy that your having a child and ensuring her future", "Honestly this is why you are a little bit AH, you are 47 now, you have youngish nieces and you have been setting them up with the expectation of being beneficiaries of your wealth. You even state that you really never expected to have a child, so you probably set up that expectation in that mindset. \n\nI have no children, I do have young relatives. It wouldn't cross my mind to tell them what I intended to leave to them if I died...it's just not how I'd want to be seen by them. To do that and take it away? I'm not sure.

Congratulations & I wish you the best going forward", "Some people only see $$$ when a well-off family member starts talking about who gets what. Sorry that you have such a crappy family.", "Your goddaughter is exactly the type of person who SHOULD inherit things. People who actually care.", "So...please for a moment, understand why the person who wasn't inheriting anything doesn't feel invested?\n\nThen why the people who may have thought they were, rightly or wrongly, may feel how they do?", "That makes sense. \n\nVery lucky girl to have such thoughtful parents. \n\nKids are great, hope you enjoy every moment!", "Was it official and court certified? Or a home test kit?", "He set a precedent and has now decided they\u2019re less important to him. Your s is unnecessary.", "He did not change his mind out of the blue. The family members should not expect their shares of the inheritance to remain intact when the OP's biological kid is coming along.

The family members are.", "> It wouldn't cross my mind to tell them what I intended to leave to them if I died...it's just not how I'd want to be seen by them.\n\nOP obviously *did* want to be seen that way by them.  And now that he's reneged on what he's been telling them for years, he's upset about it?  \n\nPeople, keep the provisions in your wills, trusts, insurance policies etc. to yourselves.  Your heirs/beneficiaries will learn about it when they need to know.", "OP is 47. Even if we just go for average lifespan for an American male, OP has 30 years left. Even if all his nieces and nephews are young, they aren\u2019t getting this windfall before they\u2019re 35 or so.\n\nThat basically means this isn\u2019t college tuition or moving out of the parent\u2019s house, or first car, or any of that. This was always going to be \u201crandom money at a time in your life where you will already have to have established yourself\u201d,  so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s suddenly depriving these nieces and nephews of an opportunity. I can understand if he was removing college funds here of something, but he isn\u2019t. A bunch of likely 40-somethings are going to be slightly less well off when their uncle dies.
