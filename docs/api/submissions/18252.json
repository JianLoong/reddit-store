This was an unplanned pregnancy and while I wasn't in love with the idea of becoming father, especially with 50 being right around the corner, I am learning to adjust because I haven't been one to shirk away from my responsibilities in nearly 30 year nor am I the child free type who has a disdain for children.\n\nFor years I was a semi-involved fun uncle type who attended most events that my nieces and nephews had, gave out nice gifts, and had set up funds/trusts for my siblings' kids as up until now I saw them as my only heirs. I had the great fortune of being a smart man with the ability to be in the right place at the right time and became CEO. After receiving the blessings of my siblings and their spouses I gave my nieces and nephews cars, expensive trips, and college funds.\n\nIn my will I stated that my nearly million dollar life insurance policy was to be divided up equally between my siblings' kids along with the money from the sale of my main and summer home, my savings, stocks/shares would be divided up as well, and a few other smaller properties. This is something that I was always up front about as I wanted no confusion after my passing. Everyone was fine with this.\n\nNow with the pending birth of my daughter I met with my lawyer and have drawn up a new will and just like before I decided to sit everyone down and tell them about the changes. My lawyer also thought it would be a good idea to get everyone to sign a statement acknowledging that they agree to the changes. I thought so too and didn't consider it an issue. Unfortunately, I was wrong and several members of my family voiced their disappointment or outright anger at how I would be giving the majority of my assets to my daughter.\n\nThey stated that it wasn't fair how I kept leading them all to believe they could expect one thing but end up getting another \"lesser\" thing. A few of them even questioned paternity but the way they did it made it feel like it was less out of concern for me and more about trying to gate keep the money and judging Pam based off of awful stereotypes. This has put me off as the way I see it, this is my way of making sure that my daughter gets everything that she's entitled to and the best support possible to make up for the fact that she will have the misfortune of having a dad in his 60s-70s when she's still growing up.\n\nI'm currently of mind to just give my daughter 90% of my assets instead of the original 60% but I wanted to run this by a few non-biased minds as, right now, I'm still a little emotional about this and my goddaughter suggested I come here. AITA?\n\nEdit: Because someone else brought this up I just wanted to be clear about one thing and answer something else. The first is that a DNA test was already done and Pam's unborn baby is 99.99% mine, but my family doesn't know I did the test because I didn't think that it was something that I had to tell them. The second is that Pam is African-American and that's why I mentioned that my family was making awful accusations about her. Pam isn't someone who I just met and I've known her to be a trustworthy and reliable person since I met her.

Your daughter getting 60% feels about right, given the close involvement you've had with your neices and nephews. Right now, you don't know if you will have a relationship with your daughter, or if you will have one that becomes distant or estranged. You aren't in a relationship with her mother, so the stability that would provide also isn't there. The mother could be in a relationship with another guy anytime, which will change things. I'm sorry that this is happening to you. It's not easy starting out into parenthood in midlife, especially when it was not  in your plans. \n\nSo, some of the things your family are concerned about are actually valid. Are you the father? If the connection was casual, you may not have been the only person who could be the father. I'm sorry to say it, but in all honesty, not being the father might be the best outcome. \n\n\nInitially offering your family the inheritance would have taken a lot of future concerns off the table for them. They might have made plans/ dreams around this, so a part of me can see their disappointment. That disappointment combined with a sense of 'who is this woman anyway', is probably what led to the hurtful comments. \n\nWhen someone is struggling to see things from my perspective, I find it useful to ask them to advise me on the best way forward, with a 'what would you do if you were me' slant. Then I listen and let some time pass. It makes them feel heard and sometimes makes them reflect on the fairness. It doesn't always work, because people are people, but it can take the 'heat' out of it for a bit. \n\nI hope you don't lose your relationships with your family over this.", "NTA\n\nYou are correct that your daughter's future is now your priority. \n\nYou've been very generous with your nieces and nephews but it's ok to now fade that out. Continue to help with college if that was promised but only if you can comfortably financially do so.\n\nAs for percentage of assets, that's a tough one. \n\n\\-If your daughter is still a child when you pass, would you want her to continue to live in your home and have the summer home? If so, those would be passed to her (in trust) and not part of cash to be divided. \n\n\\-What about money to support those homes? \n\n\\-What is the arrangement for supporting her mother being a single parent if your daughter is still a child?\n\nThere is a lot of variables.\n\nPerhaps set aside $X money a year for each niece and nephew that you keep in an account. When it reaches a certain amount, like $20-$50K for each one, stop contributing to the account. Everything else goes to your daughter, in trust or directly.", "First off, definitely NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s you\u2019re hard work and money and you can do with it whatever you like. While I understand they can feel disappointment, they have to realise circumstances change and your own biological child (accident or not) would take precedent. \n\nI would just make it clear in will it\u2019s being left DIRECTLY and safely with child, not with Pam. I\u2019d also highly suggest you change it based on proven paternity, if that actually is a concern.", "If your family is not helping you with anything, then give it all to your daughter. My thought is, \"if you do not sign my paychecks or pay my bills, what good are you?\" this should be applied to them. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou are being incredibly kind, upfront and responsible with the whole issue. It is your money and the way you decide to dispose of it now or after your passing is a decision for you and you only. Your family is being entitled and disrespectful to you in so many levels. \n\nI would have a chat with them and let them know how their behavior is reflecting on them and our personal relationship (no mention to inheritance) if their attitude does not change, leave them the 10% and nothing else, but do not involve the money in the decision making, let the show who they really are just based on your human interaction.", "NTA \nIf you had a child 20 years ago none of them would have anything to say about it.

Most State probate code identifies children as natural beneficiaries long, long before any children of siblings.

They lose nothing while he\u2019s still alive. \n\nHe didn\u2019t say how many nieces and nephews he has, but his wealth seems to be enough that even if they don\u2019t get the whole thing, they will all still be getting a nice chunk of change.  It\u2019s his million dollar insurance, investments and his home and a summer home!  \n\nIt\u2019s sad really that these young adults are so selfish to think he shouldn\u2019t leave his daughter the bulk of his estate. \n\nI wonder if anyone from his family has ever expressed any happiness that this man is becoming a father. They all know how they felt when they had their kids.", "Absolutely ridiculous scenario.\nAbsolutely things change. But he said he was blessed to be smart, but he wasn't smart enough to keep his mouth shut. Had to have the adoration by dangling the payout. I dont think he owes them a dime. I just think he is T A for talking about it so much.\nAnd if someone whith means has promised you a life changing inheritance and then took it away, I would not judge you for an initial reaction of disappointment. Anger is the secondary emotion", "Thanks for that!  I thought it sounded odd, but my old brain was having a hard time this morning before my coffee.", "Not making a case that they were forgotten per se, but a case that they were led to believe something for many years of their lives and should still be entitled based on past promises.  No idea if a lawyer would take on their case, though, unless they really think they can get something and I doubt those kids have the financial means on their own to hire a lawyer since they seems to depend on uncle for all things financial, unless they already have their hands on the trusts he set up for them.  \n\nMaybe he could also mention in the will that the trusts set up for those children should be considered their inheritance.  No idea if that is a good idea or not", "That's his personal assets, his family might not be.", "What's the benefit of telling young people that they will be beneficiaries of some wealth, 30 or so years before that may be the case? \n\nThis is my issue. He misled his young relatives into thinking he was giving them financial security, then withdrew it when his circumstances changed.\n\nIt's his money, but why make those assertions in the first place?", "Honestly I think it is. It keeps the kids from being punished for their parents' actions(assuming they are still kids and not the ones objecting) while keeping the money out of the hands of his greedy siblings.", "So that it was clear that he intended to evenly distribute his assets.\n\nHowever, no one can or should count on an inheritance.", "True, we don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s the kids themselves throwing a fit or just their parents.  Those nieces and nephews have received so much already.  They really should be grateful.  I would love to have had someone give me cars and pay my way through uni, but I had to work my butt off and drove what I could afford myself, then pay off my student loans with my jobs.", "The only reason my parents paid for my second car is because they had insurance money left over from my brother crashing his second.\n\nOtherwise I'd *still* be driving dad's pickup."]}
