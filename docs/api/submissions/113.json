My mom or dad always made it for me since it wasn't one of the available flavors at any bakeries or stores near where we grew up. When I moved away I started to make it myself. I've been married to my wife just under a year but we've been together for 6 years so she knows all about this cake. During that time we've either baked it together, my parents made it, or I've made it on my own. I've never asked or expected her to do it.\n\nBefore my birthday this year my wife asked me what kind of cake I wanted. Same kind as always but she told me she didn't feel like baking. I told her she didn't need to worry about baking it because I can just do it myself. She asked me a second time and I gave her the same answer. The day before my birthday I get home from work and have all the ingredients to make my cake. Go to get something out of the fridge and there's a pair of cheesecakes in there with 'Happy Birthday' written between them both. I asked my wife about it and she said those were the cakes for my party the next day and she thought of switching things up this year since \"everyone loves cheesecake\".\n\nI don't hate it but she gets cheesecakes at least once a month. I only ever have the cherry cake on my birthday. I told her I appreciate it and they look good but I really want the cake I like so I was going to make mine and we'll just let everyone have a choice of what cake they want. She got pissed off and yelled that I ruined her attempt to make things easier on us by not having to bake and bringing cake that everyone would love. It's been two days since the party and she was cold at the party and is still acting cold. Usually I move mountains and heaven to give her the things she wants on her birthdays and celebrate how she wants, I just wanted one specific cake for mine. AITA?\n\nUpdate: The recipe for everyone asking:\n\n 1 box chocolate cake mix\n\n1 jar maraschino cherries\n\n1 can cherry pie filling\n\n1 teaspoon almond extract\n\n1 container cool whip (2-3 cups might work, I like to slather the whole container on)\n\nChocolate sauce\n\nRum to taste\n\nMake the cake mix as directed, mix in the maraschino cherries, almond extract, and rum. Bake, take out and let it cool. Mix together the cool whip and cherry pie filling, ice the top of the cake and all sides. Drizzle with the desired amount of chocolate sauce.", "created_utc": 1667147168, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhihve/aita_because_i_baked_my_own_birthday_cake_after/", "score": 8585, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also I've never heard of a party being ruined by too much cake, that's patently absurd. Is she weirdly controlling about other things as well or is this just because she's doesn't like chocolate cherry cake? I don't get it.", "NTA It's your birthday, prepare the cake you enjoy. Your wife has nothing to be upset about, you're willing to make it yourself. Also, your wife is dead wrong, not everyone loves cheese cake.", "NTA but she is. In 6 years, she still asks what type of cake you want? Then says she does't want to make a cake and then asks you again? How is she so unable to just say that she doesn't really like that cake so, if you're happy to make your favourite cake, is it ok if she buys something else so that she has a choice? Why won't people use their words?\n\nAnd how does she know everyone will love cheesecake? Does your cake usually go uneaten or something? If not, people clearly like your cake so she's really just buying something she wants. Why get pissy over another cake? Who gets pissy over cake?! There's no such thing as too much cake!", "NTA. She didn't want to make it easier on both of you, she wanted to make it easier on herself but not feel guilty for being too lazy to help you make your cake.", "NTA\n\nShe got cheesecake because that what *she* likes.

Maybe in addition to, but not instead of. \n\nAnd her flipping out about it is total gaslighting. She wanted what she wanted and didn\u2019t want to bake.

You literally could not have handled this any more gently. You held no expectation for her to follow through on the cake you wanted, were perfectly content in making it yourself, and didn\u2019t have an issue with the cheesecakes being available at the party. Sounds like she\u2019s harboring guilt that you didn\u2019t push on her. This is such a ridiculous thing for her to be pissy about, it\u2019s literally your birthday. Also cheesecake is disgusting so she has bad taste too.", "NTA. Your wife asked you (twice) and then deliberately disregarded your preference. She clearly likes cheesecake and figured she'd impose what she wants on your birthday. I get that she didn't \"feel like baking\" - that's her prerogative.

Your wife is the AH for not listening once but twice and doing what she wanted anyway. And no, not everyone loves cheesecake. And the birthday boy didn't want it either. You have the perfect solution. Make your cake and everyone can have options. It would be different if you were throwing a fit and forcing her to make it. You're not. You're being an adult and making it yourself without complaint. Your wife on the other hand...", "NTA.\n\nYou want one thing, just ONE THING for your birthday. But, your wife wouldn\u2019t compromise at all. Instead, she came up with every excuse in the book to NOT have your favorite cake. \n\nShe didn\u2019t want to make it? That\u2019s fine. You\u2019ll make it. She says everyone loves cheesecake? Good for them, but you love your chocolate-covered cherry cake. She got mad that she bought the cheesecake but you\u2019re going to make your cake anyways? You said anyone can choose and she blows up!

I never tried it, but I can already see why it\u2019s your favorite!!!", " NTA. I don't understand her reaction at all.

You should be able to enjoy your own cake on your birthday.", "NTA but I feel like there's something missing here. Is there a reason she seems to dislike the cake? Does she like it the other times? I don't know, since it seems like she had no problem baking it with you before, then something seems off here.", "NTA - she didn\u2019t want to look like the \u201cbad\u201d wife who couldn\u2019t be bothered to make her husband a birthday cake so she bought cheesecakes & then you made your own cake.

I have special cake that I love for my birthday. It's often the only thing I request. Honoring that request is one of the most genuine \"I love you\" statements my partner makes. It's a small ask.

I added the mint extract drops to taste. 2 drops. Mixed. Tasted. Meh. Added 1 drop. Mixed. I did that until it was close to what he wanted. Then I melted mint chocolate chip bars. This made the flavor. It also added this cool green and brown marble effect.

Served with vanilla ice cream and it was pretty delightful. Even for us non chocolate mint eaters :)\n\nEdit- the 3rd attempt is what we rolled with.

Velvet cakes can be made in any colour.  My personal favourite is blue, but really you can make it any colour at all.\n\nIf you're allergic to all food dye, you can use beet juice to get the red colour, or add slightly more cocoa powder to get the reddish colour the way it was originally done (my recipe is 1tsp, I would try 2Tbs for this effect to start and adjust as necessary - don't forget to reduce flour for the increased cocoa powder otherwise it will get dry, swap out 1tsp flour for every 2tsp cocoa powder).\n\nEdit:  If you try blue, you need to swap out egg yolks with whites otherwise it can go a bit green.
