Your cousin certainly didn't help, tattling to your parents.  \n\nYTA  Sure you can say whatever you want in this world, just know there will sometimes be repercussions.", "YTA\n\nYou have no reason to feel this way. It comes across as jealousy that she has more money than you. Her daughter is so ill that she needs to spend 4 months in a hospital. She's a struggling mom dealing with a sick child....Might be wise to keep these thoughts to yourself in the future.", "I find it amusing that you classify growing up with nannies and housekeepers as only 'upper middle class' back in the 80s/90s.", "YTA. For the people saying NTA but she shouldn\u2019t have verbalized it to family, she did verbalize it which is what makes her the AH. To have your thoughts or inside joke with your husband is fine but to say it to a close family member wasn\u2019t a good move. Did you really think she was going to laugh with you and keep it to herself? This may have been a fine joke in a few years when your niece is healthy but right now its not the time. Sure your sister should be able to do these things for herself but she also has a sick daughter and if she can afford another chef what business is it of yours. We can hate the extremely wealthy all we want but if I\u2019m being real, if I had that much money I don\u2019t think I would be doing much housework either.", "YTA. Even besides the fact that she\u2019s trying her best and shouldn\u2019t be mocked for that, *her daughter is having major surgery.* She probably doesn\u2019t think about anything else!", "INFO: Why didn\u2019t your sister and her husband (presumably your niece\u2019s father) not hire extra help during these 4 months? It sounds like they have resources to do so.", "Are you serious? \n\nYTA - her child is having major surgery and she's struggling with adjusting to a new way of living and you find humor in that? Disgusting.", "YTA \n\nYour aren't an asshole for thinking it. What makes you an asshole is talking about it, especially to family.

It is a lot like reality shows that put people in an unknown environment on purpose, like Paris Hilton on a pig farm, or Wife Swap where they literally try to pick families from opposite ends of the spectrum. They literally make TV out of this scenario, so I could see how it is entertaining to watch unfold. I\u2019m glad that you are checking in on her and trying to help her out, I don\u2019t think your jealous at all. No matter how privileged someone is, it really is heartbreaking to watch your own child suffer. But you also think about the mothers that can\u2019t afford to get treatment for their child, or can\u2019t miss work to be with them in the hospital, and so the complaining about cooking and cleaning can seem a bit shocking to the average person. I hope your niece\u2019s surgery comes out okay and wish her a speedy recovery. Final verdict: YTA because you probably should have kept your thoughts to yourself.", "YTA. Her child is having major surgery, she's separated from her husband and other children, and I'm sure under a tremendous amount of stress.

It\u2019s wonderful that she has the funds that she can relieve that stress and focus on her daughter (your niece!), if only everyone did. Nobody is at their best at a time like this and you are coming off as if she\u2019s finally been brought down to your level and you\u2019re enjoying watching her struggle.", "I think verbalizing it out loud is what makes it an AH situation, as it lacks compassion. You can think it of course, or even verbalize it but in a more compassionate way...but saying it's entertaining to watch while she struggles is a bit harsh.", "Yeah you are an asshole. YTA all the way around. You find it entertaining that your sister is struggling with household things with just a nanny when her child is having a major surgery and is likely scared to death if her kid is going to be okay. YOU are just a piece of work. I'd say more but don't want to end up getting banned.", "YTA for defining what a \"normal person\" is supposed to be.  My family never grew up with a nanny, weekly housekeepers, didn't go to private school nor even had the ability to travel once or twice a year.  Yet we considered ourselves normal from the area where we were.\n\nIt seems that the main point of you going to help your sister out was to make yourself feel better was because she was helpless and you just needed a reason to put her down to others.  Her daughter is apparently having medical challenges considering she's been there for longer than a week since from the sound of the posting I'm sure she's more stressed about that than anything else.", "Does your sister know you're entertained by her struggle?\n\nBecause she will find out.\n\nYou've shared with family already.\n\nYTA", "YTA, she's dealing with a very sick child and trying to handle a way of living that shes not used to after 18 years.", "YTA\n\nYou are aware that your sister has hard time managing, because she has to spend as much time as possible with her child in the hospital. So she isn't \"trying to live like a normal person\", actually.", "YTA, maybe it's not about \"haha she's so spoiled\" and instead is because of the fact that she's worried about her sick child? Maybe she'd be better able to adapt if you didn't kick her while she's down? Don't hurt yourself climbing down off your high horse, start developing some empathy and thank your lucky stars you don't have a kid in the hospital.", "Under the circumstances, that's an inside thought.  YTA.", "YTA", "YTA. Cooking, cleaning, and all things associated with running a household is a job, hence why the role of a nanny exists.

There's a time and place for that sort of snark, and this is *not* it. She needs support and love. Not Schadenfreude.\n\nReminds me of my parent deciding to yell at me on social media and over DMs when my partner was about to go into surgery for an organ transplant. Why? Because I posted a silly photo of me 'stealing' the hospital bed.

She thinks it's so stressful to go to the grocery store, prepare food, like normal people. She surely goes to the supermarket unencumbered by the thought of what's happening to her child and having to leave her other children behind.  This is so funny, isn't it funny?* \"", "They have... Butlers.  Multiple butlers.\n\nOk.", "YTA. Envy is a terrible color of green to wear.", "YTA. You sound jealous and unhappy with your lot in life. I would spend some time reflecting on why you feel \u201centertained\u201d by your sister\u2019s struggles to adjust to caring for a sick child while separated from her husband and other children.", "I totally get your humor, we'd be friends haha, but then I'm usually willing to be a bit of an asshole. If you said this to your sisters face, and she understood the humor in your comment then it's fine. But is she a snob who thinks she deserves what she has? Does she realize she's very privileged? I think you being TA kind of depends on these answers. I'm glad your are helping her like your are. It has to be hard having a child in the hospital.\n\nEdit: to add: I forgot to say that saying this to your cousin was dumb. If you didn't know her well enough to know she could tell others what your said, you didn't know her well enough to say it to her. This is a comment i would only say to people i knew very very well, and probably not family.

It is funny. \n\nWhen my grandmother was hospitalized with two brain tumors my grandfather had to cook, clean and do the wash for himself. He could BBQ anything but couldn\u2019t cook corn, jello or a 3 minute egg. And the rest all he knew was where to find them. \n\nShe was hospitalized for 5 months and over an hour from home by the Chicago trains. \n\nWe joked so much about him and when he found out about the jokes, well I had never seen him laugh so much in my life. \n\nHe actually became a very good cook.", "NTA. That's why shows like The Simple Life were invented. It's entertaining to see how people adjust from living a life of privilege to a life of what most of us call normal. Doesn't mean you don't love your sister. And what is family anyway if you can't be amused by their little struggles, your niece's situation completely aside.", "NTA. Nah. I'd be entertained too. In fact I regularly am with my wealthy family, I \"married down\", though none of them have staff to do everything for them. It's always interesting to watch them get a reality check, or just listen to them complain about all of the terrible things in their lives.", "NTA thought it was probably best left unsaid.", "I think ESH here (you and your cousin, not your sister). While you are valid feeling that way since your sister really seems out of touch with how non-rich folks live, that thought really did not need to be verbalized. True or no, it's cruel in these circumstances, where she is trying to deal with a sick kid and learn how to be a functioning adult at the same time. \n\nYour cousin also sucks, because there was no need to go running off to tell your parents other than to cause more drama. If this gets back to your sister and makes her already stressful time worse, I would almost call the cousin a bigger AH. \n\nYour sister isn't just some rich AH suddenly learning how normal people live, she's a mother who is probably far more preoccupied with her daughter's health than remember how to use a dishwasher. I'm sensing a lot of jealousy in the way you write about her and her husband. Perhaps instead of being jealous and catty, you could try some grace and empathy?", "NTA. It is 100% entertaining to watch spoilt people struggle with real world tasks. \n\nYou're helping her manage at a difficult time with these tasks rather than just sitting back and watching her fail so I don't think you're an AH. Your cousin is though.", "NTA eat the rich.", "Your sister isn't struggling to \"live like a normal person.\". She's struggling to be a working mom to a child with severe medical issues.  The grief and depression that goes with a child having a life threatening illness is overwhelming, and the medical care can be a fulltime job.  That's why charities like the Ronald McDonald house exist, because \"normal people\" also tend to either live at the hospital or right next to it when their children are suffering.  Dallas children's hospital has bunk beds, a microwave, and a refrigerator for parents, so they can stay with their kid and sleep in shifts.  Everyone in those circumstances struggles to survive.\n\nIn that situation, if I had someone I could bring in to deliver clean clothes and even microwave meals, I'd take that in a heartbeat.  It's why many church communities arrange meals and carpools when members have a child going through similar things.\n\nYTA for enjoying her misery of trying to balance it all with a sick kid.", "Is this a legit concern? I want to help but I'm going to have to ask you to call back when you're not laughing at rich people problems. This is a NTA move. If you're not middle class enough to make fun of rich people problems, you're the same as they are.

How hard is it to do all that stuff between two females alternating days really.", "NTA.

And for all we know, that nanny may very well be an extreme comfort to this child, someone she\u2019s grown up with. Maybe mom doesn\u2019t stay the entire day every day but makes sure to see her daughter. Maybe daughter is sleeping a ton and mom is on the FaceTiming her other kids. Maybe mom is fighting her own battles.

But think about it\u2014 it\u2019s reasonable to assume the family is worried about the child. This one makes a joke about adjusting to normal life, when it really isn\u2019t all that normal. Away from her loved ones, juggling things that lots of people who aren\u2019t spoiled struggle with, on top of having a 12 year old who needs major surgery and stuck in the hospital. It\u2019s one thing to think it; but to say it expecting someone else (another relative no less!!!) to find it funny, like idk that\u2019s just AH style. It\u2019s a read the room type of situation."]}
