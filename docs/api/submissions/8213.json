For the people saying NTA but she shouldn\u2019t have verbalized it to family, she did verbalize it which is what makes her the AH.

Did you really think she was going to laugh with you and keep it to herself? This may have been a fine joke in a few years when your niece is healthy but right now its not the time. Sure your sister should be able to do these things for herself but she also has a sick daughter and if she can afford another chef what business is it of yours.

They literally make TV out of this scenario, so I could see how it is entertaining to watch unfold. I\u2019m glad that you are checking in on her and trying to help her out, I don\u2019t think your jealous at all. No matter how privileged someone is, it really is heartbreaking to watch your own child suffer. But you also think about the mothers that can\u2019t afford to get treatment for their child, or can\u2019t miss work to be with them in the hospital, and so the complaining about cooking and cleaning can seem a bit shocking to the average person.

Yet we considered ourselves normal from the area where we were.\n\nIt seems that the main point of you going to help your sister out was to make yourself feel better was because she was helpless and you just needed a reason to put her down to others.

YTA.", "YTA", "YTA. Cooking, cleaning, and all things associated with running a household is a job, hence why the role of a nanny exists.

If you said this to your sisters face, and she understood the humor in your comment then it's fine. But is she a snob who thinks she deserves what she has? Does she realize she's very privileged? I think you being TA kind of depends on these answers. I'm glad your are helping her like your are. It has to be hard having a child in the hospital.\n\nEdit: to add: I forgot to say that saying this to your cousin was dumb.

He could BBQ anything but couldn\u2019t cook corn, jello or a 3 minute egg. And the rest all he knew was where to find them. \n\nShe was hospitalized for 5 months and over an hour from home by the Chicago trains. \n\nWe joked so much about him and when he found out about the jokes, well I had never seen him laugh so much in my life. \n\nHe actually became a very good cook.", "NTA. That's why shows like The Simple Life were invented. It's entertaining to see how people adjust from living a life of privilege to a life of what most of us call normal.

While you are valid feeling that way since your sister really seems out of touch with how non-rich folks live, that thought really did not need to be verbalized. True or no, it's cruel in these circumstances, where she is trying to deal with a sick kid and learn how to be a functioning adult at the same time. \n\nYour cousin also sucks, because there was no need to go running off to tell your parents other than to cause more drama. If this gets back to your sister and makes her already stressful time worse, I would almost call the cousin a bigger AH. \n\nYour sister isn't just some rich AH suddenly learning how normal people live, she's a mother who is probably far more preoccupied with her daughter's health than remember how to use a dishwasher. I'm sensing a lot of jealousy in the way you write about her and her husband. Perhaps instead of being jealous and catty, you could try some grace and empathy?", "NTA. It is 100% entertaining to watch spoilt people struggle with real world tasks. \n\nYou're helping her manage at a difficult time with these tasks rather than just sitting back and watching her fail so I don't think you're an AH. Your cousin is though.", "[removed]", "Your sister isn't struggling to \"live like a normal person.\". She's struggling to be a working mom to a child with severe medical issues.  The grief and depression that goes with a child having a life threatening illness is overwhelming, and the medical care can be a fulltime job.  That's why charities like the Ronald McDonald house exist, because \"normal people\" also tend to either live at the hospital or right next to it when their children are suffering.  Dallas children's hospital has bunk beds, a microwave, and a refrigerator for parents, so they can stay with their kid and sleep in shifts.  Everyone in those circumstances struggles to survive.\n\nIn that situation, if I had someone I could bring in to deliver clean clothes and even microwave meals, I'd take that in a heartbeat.  It's why many church communities arrange meals and carpools when members have a child going through similar things.\n\nYTA for enjoying her misery of trying to balance it all with a sick kid.", "Is this a legit concern?

Because she married a well off man?\n\nYTA and a horrible sister.  Your niece is in the hospital and you're enjoying watching your sister struggle.  Like, what kind of person are you?", "Yeah, my eyebrow twitched at her definition of \"middle class\".", "This. Most people who are ill feel bad for demanding 24/7 attention, especially from the same person, even if it's mom.", "Same, except I have a parrot. I have someone coming to clean my apartment every week and I eat frozen food. I'm not lazy, it's just that my interests are elsewhere.\n\nAt the pandemic I cleaned a toilet for the first time in my life and it wasn't that bad. I did quite well with all the new chores. I just don't want to do them, that's all.", "I\u2019m actually wondering if they are alternating who does an overnight shift? If they are here for 4 months, that\u2019s a gruelling amount if time to spend at the hospital, even as a visitor. (I did a lot of hospital visits for my parents, they are draining)", "But she's sending the nanny to replace her presence at the hospital while she's cooking and cleaning at home so it's not like she's having fun, OP even says she's struggling. I think it may be an instance where the nanny has been with their family a long time and her daughter wants to spend time with the nanny. I just don't think this sounds like an instance where the mom is being neglectful.", "I would assume it is same nanny that was doing babysitting before and the kid has emotional attachment to her too. Cutting the kid off nanny might the the crueler thing to do.\n\nFor the record, never had nanny and would not sleep outside hospital. I would go sleep to home, like overwhelming majority of parents. I would also be ok with father being there some days instead of me or grandparents. Which is other thing about less rich families - the cooking and day in hospital stuff is taken over by partner in these situations.\n\nIt is not healthy to refuse to leave even for 5 minutes. As heroic as it sounds, it do no one good and you will mental breakdown over time. And the last thing the kid needs is emotionally unstable parent, because parent is sleep deprived and haven't had free 5 minutes for weeks.", "right", "Right?!?! haha!!! \"Upper middle class\" who had a nanny AND weekly house keepers.... Sorry, but if you have house keepers (plural) and nanny's.... You aren't middle class.", "That's great. Taking delight in your own family member's illness and being jealous of your sister is what assholes do.\n\nMy niece is like my own daughter. If she were in the hospital like this, I'd be taking over the chores so her parents could be with her, and then I'd be at the hospital with her.\n\nThis isn't how family treats one another.", "I grew up with a nanny. She was like a second mother to me. \n\nI loved her and still do. My children\u2019s some times loves their nanny more than they love me I swear. I have to be mean discipline mom sometimes and then they\u2019ll \u201ctattle\u201d on me to their nanny who \u201ccomforts\u201d them. I can 100% see that a nanny that grew up with you is someone you\u2019d want with you in a hospital when you\u2019re very sick.", "I don't think they're insinuating that mom is neglectful, but rather that niece's condition is not grave. In the sense that the niece is not on her deathbed, nor that they could receive news any minute that her condition got critical. It just seems that she has a rare genetic condition and the doctors who are able to treat it and operate work at that hospital.", ">\tMy niece is like my own daughter. If she were in the hospital like this, I\u2019d be taking over the chores so her parents could be with her, and then I\u2019d be at the hospital with her.\n\nYou mean like OP does?", "I have heard of rich kids who like the nanny more. I figured that was a symptom of absent parents, good point that it could be an involved parent having to be the bad guy and the nanny being the fun one, a dynamic that could also happen with one parent compared to another", "What you mean when she drives over once a week? Yea, really \u201ctaking over\u201d there \ud83d\ude44"]}
