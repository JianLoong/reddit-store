There is nothing exciting here as I like to read, but I wanted to ask because it is a sensitive situation.\n\nMy husband (37M) and I (35F) have been together for about 10 years, and we have been married for 3 years. So I think I know him very well. Unfortunately, that includes when he lied.\n\nHe has been depressed lately due to his work and family issues. He hasn't been working for a while, doesn't like to leave the house, so of course he gained weight. I also gained weight. \"Let's find a solution to this,\" he said. Because being fit in the profession my husband is considering is important, although not mandatory.\n\nAs I am the only one working for now, our financial situation is not bad, but we cannot reach every luxury we want. This included the gym. But since it was an important issue for both of us, we allocated a budget for it and we both signed up. Since I work in the office, I go to the gym in the evenings. My husband goes three days a week in the morning. Since he doesn't like fitness much, we signed him up for the more expensive swimming.\n\nThe other day, although we used the same bag, my items were still in my bag. \"I used my old bag,\" he said. I looked at his swimsuit and towels, completely dry on the clothes hanger on the balcony. (It's unlikely to dry that fast since it's winter.)\n\nBut while texting, he wrote \"I'm going swimming now, my phone signal may go down\". (There is no telephone reception on the floor where the pool is located.) I trusted and did not write. But when I got home, her hair didn't look like it had just been washed. And then I looked at towels, swimsuits and bags.\n\nThere are a few more such things. No, I don't suspect he went elsewhere. On the contrary, I suspect that he never left the house. He has a therapist for depression & other problems and he goes at least once every two weeks.\n\nThe possibility that he's lying to me while I'm doing my best to make him well pisses me off. If he said \"I don't want to go this week\", I would have understood it. Because we can't all find the strength to do sports sometimes. But it worries me that he tries so hard to convince me he's going to the gym.\n\nI will try to calm down until this evening. WIBTA if I said I got that he is lying to me? I'd like to shake hi\u00f6 into reality - I've never done this before.\n\nNote: We have never argued, we only discussed things in a really civil manners. But this time I really want to yell at him.

He's struggling (and yes, lying to you). Why don't you suggest he join you in the evening? It's easier to be motivated to work out with someone else.", "NTA \n\nBut, since he\u2019s got depression, I would say go at it like you always do, by discussing it and not exploding even if you want to haha, which, you rightfully should, but it\u2019s better not to haha", "Depression is a tricky thing, he probably just couldn\u2019t muster the energy to go. Should he have lied, no. But I think you need to think about why he lied? He likely was worried about your reaction and wasn\u2019t something he wanted to deal with. Missing one day at the gym doesn\u2019t mean your money is wasted. It means he needed a day off for his mental health. Instead of coming at him mad, try asking nicely. Like hey I noticed your swimsuit was dry, if you didn\u2019t go that\u2019s okay, I just want to talk about why you had to lie. YTA if you go in angry instead of out of concern.", "I think if I were in that situation, I probably wouldn't say anything just yet; I'd wait and see how it plays out. Also I don't think yelling at someone helps them with their depression, or would accomplish anything productive here. He's only cheating himself by not going, and he might be lying because he's worried you would be disappointed in him. I'd try waiting a while, and see if he finally works up the motivation on his own to actually start going. Attacking him would probably just make him more depressed, and less likely to go.", "You would not be the asshole for confronting him and trying to talk about it, as it's always better to be honest and truthful in relationships. \n\nHowever you do kinda seem like an AH from your reaction. I am finding it really difficult to believe that you have \"never argued, only discussed things in a civil manner\" if this situation \"makes you \"really wanna yell at him\". He might have lied because he was ashamed that he didn't have the strenght to go and thus felt like he disappointed you...", "Soft ESH for both of you, but honestly you more so.\n\nYou are not his mother or his keeper. You mean well, and you want him to get well, but really it's not your job.\n\nDepression is HARD and sometimes makes you just want to lie on the couch, not move at all.\n\nHe should not have lied, but likely did so because because you sound like a person with strong opinions.\n\nYou can bring it up in a civil manner, but if you yell at him or make his life harder over this, you will be the TA.", "NTA \n\nDepending on how you go about it. Speaking to him and asking is fine. Pointing out what you've noticed is also fine. Where you cross into ah is if you press the issue with no other evidence or push him to \"admit it\". Right now, all you've got is dry clothes and messy hair. Short of him admitting to it or you coming up with solid proof (catching him home when he said he's at the gym), it really isn't worth it to press the issue.", "NTA don't make it hard could inspire further lying", "ESH, Offer your husband some grace on this and let it go. He needs space to work through this tough time just be there with love and support. He probably knows you know anyway. Exposing this would cause more harm than good. IMO.", "YTA if you yell or argue. Have a conversation. Ask him to be honest with you and let you know what\u2019s up with him. Create a safe space for him to be honest. Let him know how it makes you feel when he lies.", "NAH\n\nHe's struggling and you yelling at him won't help.  I wouldn't be confronting him about this but it probably needs to be brought up in some sort of fashion.  He may really hate the gym and the swimming.  Does he use the gym at all or is it just the swimming you're paying for.\n\nPerhaps find something that you can do together if you are unable to attend the gym at the same time.  What about an after dinner walk every night?", "NAH Depression is a rough one, I've literally been there, wanting to go to the gym but not able to and then lying about it because I felt ashamed that I wasn't able to get myself out the door.  Being frustrated that he's not honest is also valid and but how you express that is important.  Simply calling him out won't help the situation, talking to him about it will be more helpful.  I would also suggest arranging to do things he's finding hard together.  If he's struggling to get out of the depressive funk to go swimming alone go with him, or sign yourselves up for something else if money is an issue.  Tennis, and badminton are usually pretty cheap if there are public courts available (if not then I know way too expensive).  Just going for walks is a great option too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

He lied because he feels like shit that he couldn\u2019t muster up the strength to go. Because he\u2019s depressed. You know that. \n\nInstead of getting angry over a lie that doesn\u2019t harm you in the slightest, perhaps just be there for him. He probably feels insecure and upset in his current state and felt embarrassed that he didn\u2019t go. Especially when he knows you guys can\u2019t really afford it. What he needs is support and communication, not anger. If you don\u2019t suspect he left the house, why does it upset you so much?", "NAH\n\nYou say **If he said \"I don't want to go this week\", I would have understood it.** but it seems he either doesnt believe it or feels to ashamed to admit the truth.\n\nI would spend less time feeling pissed off and maybe try communicating more", "I was NT A till the Note. YTA no wonder he lied if you want to yell about this.", "I'd like to do that. But the sports complex is a facility owned by municipality. They divided the days as women and men. So they allow only men in 3 days a week and only women in 3 days a week. In return, the prices are way lower than private ones.", "That is exactly why I think I will be TA if I confront him. Maybe he is so depressed that he does not want to deal with my reaction.\n\nBy the way, it is not a day off, he has missed 3 days out of 6 days already. I am not worried about the money being wasted, but starting a new thing that he wanted so much became a burden for him (and bad enough to lie for) just in 2 weeks.", "I specified yelling because we have never yelled or even talked loudly to each other. I am also surprised at my own feelings and the reaction I want to give.", "The amount of petty lying makes me cringe. A few minutes ago he said  \"Amazon package came just as I was entering the house. I met the deliverer on the way. Look at the chance!\"\n\nBut I know that the Amazon package is delivered 40 minutes ago directly to him - when he supposed to be swimming. LOL. I got an SMS about the details of the delivery.\n\nBut at the same time as you said, these can all be a coincidence.", "Ah, that's too bad. Any other (male) friends he can go with?", "Op, I was like your husband when I was depressed a few years ago. (Although my wife would actually scream at me if I simply couldn't find the energy to do sports, so that was why I lied sometimes). I hate lying, but I just couldn't deal with her screaming at me in my vulnerable state.\n\nI think Goldensand is right. You should address it, because it's not a good sign that he feels the need to lie - tell him he doesn't need to lie, and that you understand his situation. Work this out together, without accusations and aggression. That's the way forward.\n\nAll the best to you two!", "op i bet hes dealing with a lot of shame and guilt and self image issues regarding failure.  depression does that to you.  its hard to face it.  not saying what he did is right, but perspective.", "If you yell at him, you will subject him to a reaction that he was scared you would have. In future he may lie again as he may want to avoid this same reaction. \n\nSo you should discuss it nicely with him. If you really want to be supportive, the conversation should be: I noticed that perhaps you\u2019re not really going to the gym, I\u2019m not mad if that\u2019s the case but I hoped that you would have come to me with any issues as I\u2019m you\u2019re wife and I love you, I want our relationship to be one where you can be honest with me. If he is depressed the kind thing to do would be to ask if there\u2019s anything more you can do to support him to help with whatever issue he is having.", "I know those feelings well, I have a depressed partner and it's terrifying to see them getting more and more stuck.\n\nBut that's the thing about mental illness, one is unable to do the healthy thing. Unable. What would be the point in gettting frustrated with him? Especially as that would probably lengthen his depression. Google the Stress Bucket to see what I mean.\n\nSupport in, vent out, is another helpful idea. Find your own outlet for your fears about his health, one which won't harm his mental state or his reputation.", "Hey, I have been struggling with depression for over 10 years now and I want to give you my 2 cents about the lying part. \n\nI don't know if this is true for your husband but it is something that might shine a new light on the problem.\n\nAdmitting that your depression has control over you and that you are not strong enough to fight it is a REALLY hard thing to do. Often times it's a lot easier to just lie about doing something (with the intend of actually doing it later) just to avoid the crushing truth that you are not able to do it -right now-.\n\nHe probably wants to go to the gym but his depression got the better of him and instead of facing \"his loss\" he constructed a lie. He's not only lying to you but to himself as well in an attempt to gain some space/time to get his feet back on the ground.\n\nI think confronting him is a good thing, but not in a \"I'm mad at you\" way. Let him know that you see him struggling and that it is okay for him to \"be weak\" around you and that the lying part is not helping his cause. Sometimes the depression wins and that's okay as long as you can stand up afterwards and keep fighting.", "NTA that'd drive me nuts", "Unfortunately. That is another thing worrying me about him. He does not have any male friends that he meets regularly. They just talk on the phone."]}
