Jake started first grade at the beginning of the year, so I decided to buy myself a PS5, since my wife has more free time, and I like gaming. I do my fair share of the housework and parenting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n90% of any gaming I do during the week is playing Mario Kart on my Wii with Jake. Sometimes I will play some other games on the PS with him. I usually spend about half an hour playing Wii with him between dinner and bathtime. It's like our bonding time. I still do lots of non-game stuff with him before dinner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe main reason I bought my PS is because my friends are gamers. I don't see them often since my wife goes out with one of her sisters almost every Sunday, which is the only day I don't work, so I can't go see them. So I spend about an hour in the morning on Sunday playing CoD and chatting with them before my wife leaves. I then spend the rest of the day with Jake.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of my SILs, who lives 8 hours away, came over recently. She's single. She saw my console in the living room and spent a considerable amount of time during her stay saying how a \"real man\" would never have one and similar stuff, including insulting my masculinity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI went to start up my PS since Jake was asking to play Fall Guys after dinner and realized it was gone. I played Mario Kart with him for a while, bathed him, and put him to bed, before talking to my wife. She told me SIL was right, and I don't need one since I \"never do anything\". I don't know what happened to it, but I haven't gotten it back yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I told her I would not be doing any house chores until I had it back since I'm \"useless\" anyway. I still spend the same amount of time with my son; nothing's changed there. But now I go out to the park with him when I get home, rather than doing clean up with her. I haven't cooked anything since then when I usually cook at least three times a week. The dishes have started piling up a bit, as has the laundry, and the house is in a bit of disorder. Jake's quite happy though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday, I put my son to bed and went out with one of my friends for a couple of hours because I haven't gotten to talk to any of them face-to-face in months. We were at a bar, but I didn't drink anything and drove myself home. My wife went off on me, demanding to know why I haven't been doing anything. I just said all I want is my console back, and I'd be happy to go back to how things were. She's been pissy and antsy all week, but she went off on me right then. She started pointing out all of the little messes that I usually clean up, and I pointed out that those couldn't be my fault since I don't do anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know I'm being petty, but some of her and SIL's words were pretty hurtful and uncalled for, and honestly, I want her to see what my \"doing nothing\" is actually like. She keeps calling me an asshole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1683256249, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1388xwa/aita_for_going_out_with_friends_and_refusing_to/", "score": 335, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've married into a delightful family but the sounds of it...\n\nIs your behaviour petty? Yes. Is it justified? Also yes. Will you two stay together if you can't communicate like adults? Probably not.\n\nHowever, I still think NTA. Your wife is enjoying the result of \"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes\". The question will be how you two move past this.", "NTA\n\nYou are allowed to have hobbies.  It sounds like you were pulling your weight and your wife was fine with how things were until SIL put stuff in her head.  She needs to grow up.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re parenting. You\u2019re doing your share of the chores. The one thing you\u2019re not doing is hanging out with your friends because your wife picks the one day you have off to go out with her friends, which\u2026 If you were a wife and your husband was doing this, especially in the wake of taking away your console, I would be concerned that you\u2019re being isolated, which is a sign of abuse.\n\nEdit for clarification: My point is that people tend to ignore red flags when the victim is a man. Have you talked to your friends about what\u2019s going on? Maybe ask for their opinions? Sometimes, people just need to hear that their friend is receptive, and they\u2019ll vocalize their concerns.", "Nta, my golden rule is \u201cdon\u2019t take my shit\u201d. she only had a problem due to SIL having a problem. She has no reason to act this way.", "If my s/o hid a $400 piece of tech that I bought for myself I would have lost my shit & got it back immediately.

I hope she can see the error in her perspective. Stay strong.", "NTA. Your wife is a major AH and so is her sister. You're a grown ass man that just got put in a gaming time out all while being insulted by 2 controlling AH's. What the hell is wrong with them?!", "You are NTA, but I'm very concerned about this situation. Taking your things (especially a $500 console!) away from you is abusive. Couple that with the toxic bullshit about what \"real men\" do...Like, you do realize that Jake is eventually going to be subjected to that toxicity from your wife and SIL if they think it's valid to apply to you, right? \n\nI don't know if you guys need counseling (it can be dangerous to go to therapy with an abuser, because they can learn fun new ways to abuse you) or something more serious like a separation--only you can really decide that. But this doesn't feel small or harmless to me. \n\nAdd to that: taking the console away from you when it is *your sole method of socializing* feels like isolating you from your friends and support. So that's two major abusive red flags for the price of one stolen console. Please take care of yourself and Jake, and do remember that men can be abused by their partners, just as anyone else can be. \ud83d\ude1e", "NTA\n\nYour wife stole your property, she's keeping your console from you like you're some errant child.\n\nThat's not adult behavior, that's childish behavior.   \n\nYou aren't handling this well though.   This should be a sit down and actually communicate discussion time, not a tit for tat pissing match.   If SIL took your PS with her, it's been sold, or thrown out you really need to talk to a lawyer because that doesn't bode well for your relationship's health.", "NTA but I'll bet your wife gave the PS to the sister and that's why she won't give it back - because she can't.  Bet the sister thought it was a really crafty way to either get one for herself or for a friend.  Tell your wife you are going to report it stolen to the cops - see if she produces it then.", "NTA. Your SIL is and it sounds like she\u2019s a bad influence on your wife. You and your wife need to work on communication. It\u2019s not good for your son to see his parents bickering like that or to have to live in a messy house while you work it out. Since you\u2019re both already being a bit petty, you might as well pit your son against his aunt for taking away your Fall Guys play time.", "NTA but talk to your wife and ask her why she thinks that her sister\u2019s opinion should have anything to do with your relationship.", "If what you describe in terms of help around the house is true, I'd say NTA. You are allowed to have your \"decompress\" time just as much as her. It doesn't really make any sense for her to take it away, unless there's something else she is resenting.", "NTA it really feels wrong to read that instead of talking about it, your wife just took the console? It seems to me you are doing a fair share of the chores, you take care of your son, and your wife gets to have her Sunday but you don't get to have an hour for yourself???", "I think your sil has your console. Seems like your wife was all too easy to dupe into handing it over. NTA. Your wife is though.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t say you not doing the things you usually do around the house is petty, I get the feeling you wanted your wife to come to the realization on her own that those things piling up are the things you usually do. And it sounds like she did but she\u2019s too stubborn to say so and apologize. \n\nYour wife needs to be able to have thoughts of her own and not be so easily influenced. If her SIL said she should leave you, would she jump on that bandwagon too? \n\nWhat she did was straight up what a parent does to a child. You guys should really have a sit down because none of that sounds healthy or fair.", "NTA. My husband and I both spend time playing video games but stuff still gets done and he works every day and most months doesn't even get a day off. SIL is just bringing her own relationship issues onto you and that's not right. She needs to get help for that.", "NTA", "NTA.  I would buy another one and tell her if she touches it, its divorce time.", "NTA. \n\nPretty sure SIL has the console, though. Frankly, I think it\u2019s time to stop playing this game. Tell your wife that if you can\u2019t find the console yourself, you\u2019ll be reporting it stolen- and telling the police that your SIL was in the house and remarking on it.", "NTA. Men who game are awesome\u2026especially when they also game with their kids and generally are a great father and spouse. My Dad and I used to game together all the time.", "NTA. She's letting her single sister dictate the terms of your marriage. That is not acceptable in any reality. Honestly, at this point, I'd tell her the conditions have changed: she now has to return the console AND agree to marriage counseling before you'll resume previous activities.", "NTA. Someone needs to tell you that your wife doing this is considered abuse. She is trying to control you and treat you like a child. You don\u2019t need to be disciplined or punished. I would demand she get therapy and couples counseling", "NTA. It's 2023. I can't believe people still think video games are \"for kids\" and real men don't play games. Lol what? Video games began roughly in the 70s. Guess what... those kids are in their 50s now. Games are for everyone. If your household and family responsibilities were being met, what do playing video games have to do with anything? That's crazy. Video games are a great bonding tool and they teach hand eye coordination and teamwork. \n\nYour SIL is stirring the pot for some reason. She has no right to meddle in your marriage and I feel bad your wife listens to her without talking to you. You are not being petty. Your wife literally stole from you and I am sure your son will be upset that it's gone if he wants to play games like Fall Guys. You're a great dad and a great husband. Talk to your wife and ask why she is listening to her SIL about your gaming. You did everything right and didn't deserve any punishment. Stealing your console is punishment.\n\nAlso, I have a feeling you don't have it back because I think she gave it to the SIL who tricked her so her family could now have a PS5 as they are not cheap. Good luck to you.", "NTA. It sounds like you need counseling. When one partner in a relationship decides they get to unilaterally make decisions for the other partner, against their will, that is a pretty good sign of a bigger problem. It is an issue by itself that your wife has the attitude she does towards you and your contributions and hobbies. Adding that she also believes she has the right to confiscate your stuff like you\u2019re a child\u2026 that needs to be addressed.", "Conversations are always the most healthy way to solve things like this. Like in the argument you\u2019re completely in the right, but sometimes it ain\u2019t about winning, it\u2019s about doing the best thing. You\u2019re NTA. but we\u2019re creatures of habit, and creating an environment where parents are petty and vindictive, actively trying to get back at each other won\u2019t breed positive outcomes for your relationship or for your son.", "NTA. But both of you seriously need to learn communication skills. I say this as a gamer, a wife, and a therapist.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The wife needs to not let her sister's biased and stupid ideas about gaming and masculinity influence her. It was super controlling and childish to take the ps. I would never stand for it.
