Jake started first grade at the beginning of the year, so I decided to buy myself a PS5, since my wife has more free time, and I like gaming. I do my fair share of the housework and parenting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n90% of any gaming I do during the week is playing Mario Kart on my Wii with Jake. Sometimes I will play some other games on the PS with him. I usually spend about half an hour playing Wii with him between dinner and bathtime. It's like our bonding time. I still do lots of non-game stuff with him before dinner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe main reason I bought my PS is because my friends are gamers. I don't see them often since my wife goes out with one of her sisters almost every Sunday, which is the only day I don't work, so I can't go see them. So I spend about an hour in the morning on Sunday playing CoD and chatting with them before my wife leaves. I then spend the rest of the day with Jake.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of my SILs, who lives 8 hours away, came over recently. She's single. She saw my console in the living room and spent a considerable amount of time during her stay saying how a \"real man\" would never have one and similar stuff, including insulting my masculinity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI went to start up my PS since Jake was asking to play Fall Guys after dinner and realized it was gone. I played Mario Kart with him for a while, bathed him, and put him to bed, before talking to my wife. She told me SIL was right, and I don't need one since I \"never do anything\". I don't know what happened to it, but I haven't gotten it back yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I told her I would not be doing any house chores until I had it back since I'm \"useless\" anyway. I still spend the same amount of time with my son; nothing's changed there. But now I go out to the park with him when I get home, rather than doing clean up with her. I haven't cooked anything since then when I usually cook at least three times a week. The dishes have started piling up a bit, as has the laundry, and the house is in a bit of disorder. Jake's quite happy though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday, I put my son to bed and went out with one of my friends for a couple of hours because I haven't gotten to talk to any of them face-to-face in months. We were at a bar, but I didn't drink anything and drove myself home. My wife went off on me, demanding to know why I haven't been doing anything. I just said all I want is my console back, and I'd be happy to go back to how things were. She's been pissy and antsy all week, but she went off on me right then. She started pointing out all of the little messes that I usually clean up, and I pointed out that those couldn't be my fault since I don't do anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know I'm being petty, but some of her and SIL's words were pretty hurtful and uncalled for, and honestly, I want her to see what my \"doing nothing\" is actually like. She keeps calling me an asshole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1683256249, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1388xwa/aita_for_going_out_with_friends_and_refusing_to/", "score": 1348, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've married into a delightful family but the sounds of it...\n\nIs your behaviour petty? Yes. Is it justified? Also yes. Will you two stay together if you can't communicate like adults? Probably not.\n\nHowever, I still think NTA. Your wife is enjoying the result of \"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes\". The question will be how you two move past this.", "NTA\n\nYou are allowed to have hobbies.  It sounds like you were pulling your weight and your wife was fine with how things were until SIL put stuff in her head.  She needs to grow up.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re parenting. You\u2019re doing your share of the chores. The one thing you\u2019re not doing is hanging out with your friends because your wife picks the one day you have off to go out with her friends, which\u2026 If you were a wife and your husband was doing this, especially in the wake of taking away your console, I would be concerned that you\u2019re being isolated, which is a sign of abuse.\n\nEdit for clarification: My point is that people tend to ignore red flags when the victim is a man. Have you talked to your friends about what\u2019s going on? Maybe ask for their opinions? Sometimes, people just need to hear that their friend is receptive, and they\u2019ll vocalize their concerns.", "Nta, my golden rule is \u201cdon\u2019t take my shit\u201d. she only had a problem due to SIL having a problem. She has no reason to act this way.", "If my s/o hid a $400 piece of tech that I bought for myself I would have lost my shit & got it back immediately.

I hope she can see the error in her perspective. Stay strong.", "NTA. Your wife is a major AH and so is her sister. You're a grown ass man that just got put in a gaming time out all while being insulted by 2 controlling AH's. What the hell is wrong with them?!", "You are NTA, but I'm very concerned about this situation. Taking your things (especially a $500 console!) away from you is abusive. Couple that with the toxic bullshit about what \"real men\" do...Like, you do realize that Jake is eventually going to be subjected to that toxicity from your wife and SIL if they think it's valid to apply to you, right? \n\nI don't know if you guys need counseling (it can be dangerous to go to therapy with an abuser, because they can learn fun new ways to abuse you) or something more serious like a separation--only you can really decide that. But this doesn't feel small or harmless to me. \n\nAdd to that: taking the console away from you when it is *your sole method of socializing* feels like isolating you from your friends and support. So that's two major abusive red flags for the price of one stolen console. Please take care of yourself and Jake, and do remember that men can be abused by their partners, just as anyone else can be. \ud83d\ude1e", "NTA\n\nYour wife stole your property, she's keeping your console from you like you're some errant child.\n\nThat's not adult behavior, that's childish behavior.   \n\nYou aren't handling this well though.   This should be a sit down and actually communicate discussion time, not a tit for tat pissing match.   If SIL took your PS with her, it's been sold, or thrown out you really need to talk to a lawyer because that doesn't bode well for your relationship's health.", "NTA but I'll bet your wife gave the PS to the sister and that's why she won't give it back - because she can't.  Bet the sister thought it was a really crafty way to either get one for herself or for a friend.  Tell your wife you are going to report it stolen to the cops - see if she produces it then.", "NTA. Your SIL is and it sounds like she\u2019s a bad influence on your wife. You and your wife need to work on communication. It\u2019s not good for your son to see his parents bickering like that or to have to live in a messy house while you work it out. Since you\u2019re both already being a bit petty, you might as well pit your son against his aunt for taking away your Fall Guys play time.", "NTA but talk to your wife and ask her why she thinks that her sister\u2019s opinion should have anything to do with your relationship.", "If what you describe in terms of help around the house is true, I'd say NTA. You are allowed to have your \"decompress\" time just as much as her. It doesn't really make any sense for her to take it away, unless there's something else she is resenting.", "NTA it really feels wrong to read that instead of talking about it, your wife just took the console? It seems to me you are doing a fair share of the chores, you take care of your son, and your wife gets to have her Sunday but you don't get to have an hour for yourself???", "I think your sil has your console. Seems like your wife was all too easy to dupe into handing it over. NTA. Your wife is though.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t say you not doing the things you usually do around the house is petty, I get the feeling you wanted your wife to come to the realization on her own that those things piling up are the things you usually do. And it sounds like she did but she\u2019s too stubborn to say so and apologize. \n\nYour wife needs to be able to have thoughts of her own and not be so easily influenced. If her SIL said she should leave you, would she jump on that bandwagon too? \n\nWhat she did was straight up what a parent does to a child. You guys should really have a sit down because none of that sounds healthy or fair.", "NTA. My husband and I both spend time playing video games but stuff still gets done and he works every day and most months doesn't even get a day off. SIL is just bringing her own relationship issues onto you and that's not right. She needs to get help for that.", "NTA", "NTA.  I would buy another one and tell her if she touches it, its divorce time.", "NTA. \n\nPretty sure SIL has the console, though. Frankly, I think it\u2019s time to stop playing this game. Tell your wife that if you can\u2019t find the console yourself, you\u2019ll be reporting it stolen- and telling the police that your SIL was in the house and remarking on it.", "NTA. Men who game are awesome\u2026especially when they also game with their kids and generally are a great father and spouse. My Dad and I used to game together all the time.", "NTA. She's letting her single sister dictate the terms of your marriage. That is not acceptable in any reality. Honestly, at this point, I'd tell her the conditions have changed: she now has to return the console AND agree to marriage counseling before you'll resume previous activities.", "NTA. Someone needs to tell you that your wife doing this is considered abuse. She is trying to control you and treat you like a child. You don\u2019t need to be disciplined or punished. I would demand she get therapy and couples counseling", "NTA. It's 2023. I can't believe people still think video games are \"for kids\" and real men don't play games. Lol what? Video games began roughly in the 70s. Guess what... those kids are in their 50s now. Games are for everyone. If your household and family responsibilities were being met, what do playing video games have to do with anything? That's crazy. Video games are a great bonding tool and they teach hand eye coordination and teamwork. \n\nYour SIL is stirring the pot for some reason. She has no right to meddle in your marriage and I feel bad your wife listens to her without talking to you. You are not being petty. Your wife literally stole from you and I am sure your son will be upset that it's gone if he wants to play games like Fall Guys. You're a great dad and a great husband. Talk to your wife and ask why she is listening to her SIL about your gaming. You did everything right and didn't deserve any punishment. Stealing your console is punishment.\n\nAlso, I have a feeling you don't have it back because I think she gave it to the SIL who tricked her so her family could now have a PS5 as they are not cheap. Good luck to you.", "NTA. It sounds like you need counseling. When one partner in a relationship decides they get to unilaterally make decisions for the other partner, against their will, that is a pretty good sign of a bigger problem. It is an issue by itself that your wife has the attitude she does towards you and your contributions and hobbies. Adding that she also believes she has the right to confiscate your stuff like you\u2019re a child\u2026 that needs to be addressed.", "Conversations are always the most healthy way to solve things like this. Like in the argument you\u2019re completely in the right, but sometimes it ain\u2019t about winning, it\u2019s about doing the best thing. You\u2019re NTA. but we\u2019re creatures of habit, and creating an environment where parents are petty and vindictive, actively trying to get back at each other won\u2019t breed positive outcomes for your relationship or for your son.", "NTA. But both of you seriously need to learn communication skills. I say this as a gamer, a wife, and a therapist.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The wife needs to not let her sister's biased and stupid ideas about gaming and masculinity influence her. It was super controlling and childish to take the ps. I would never stand for it.

If games were taken too the value of items stolen could even make it a felony.", "Can this comment be higher please? This is 100% abusive, we would be flipping our shit if the genders were reversed. My ex-bf HATED that I played games and went out of his way to shame me/put me down regarding it given the slightest opportunity, and even his dumb insecure ass wouldn't have hidden/stolen my PC because he knew it would have made him the bad guy with our friends. I really hope OP sees this for the power-play it really is.", "\ud83d\udcaf this.\nPlease, lawyer up and leave this abuser ASAP.\nI know divorces are messy and you have a child but in the end it will be worth it.\nYou never know if your wife and her family will subject him to psychological abuse when he grows up.\nTalk to your friends. Talk to a therapist, keep records and build a case,  approach a support group.\nYou deserve to be happy and your child too.", "I think you read too much into this. He has friends in \u201ereal life\u201c and even met them as he writes\u2026", "Haha this was my thinking too! What kinda backwards shit is this!? I couldn't have a spouse who didn't game, let alone pull this bullshit. \n\nBet the SIL has been ditched before and thinks it was the gaming's fault and not her shitty personality.", "I agree. The wives behaviour is really suspicious. The child is at school all week, but yet she doesn't even get stuff done around the house? What is she doing with her time exactly? The one day off, they all get together, and she disappears. I feel bad for OP as it doesn't sound like he even realises how even before the computer stuff he was being taken advantage of.", "I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ME! Her behavior is super suspicious. Even if she's not cheating she is definitely taking advantage.", "It seems like they don\u2019t really do anything as a couple or family anyway. She takes off for \u2018me\u2019 time on his one day off", "I feel like the sil said all that so she can take the PS5.", "> However are you spending quality time at all with your wife?\n\nIf quality time is a problem, then why is she going out for the whole day the one day a week he has off work?\n\n> People who are happy with their spouse don\u2019t fall for ear worms like her sister.\n\nThat's just bullshit.", "If you saw OPs comment, it's worse. I would say the relationship is very unbalanced and unfair in general. OP works 6 days a week and does more than 50% of child care and chores and his wife is a stay at home mom. His only day off the wife goes away with friends.", "What a condescending comment. \n\nThe OP is doing the majority of childcare and chores while working 6 days out of the week. On his day off, his wife leaves to hang out with friends and family. She doesn't work. His wife allows her sister to belittle him then the wife steals his PS5. \n\nThe wife needs to pull her head out of her ass fast or else she's going to lose her golden ticket.", "Do you have brain damage ?", "well, good riddance. wife sits on her ass all day and goes out with friends the one day he has off. he should've dumped her yesterday", "it may be nothing to you but for many people it\u2019s the only way to de-stress and play with friends. He said himself that he never sees his friends so gaming is the only way he can talk to them. So no it\u2019s not just over a gaming system", "Yeah. I've been married for 20 years and I would 100% be buying a new ps for my new apartment. Partners don't treat each other like children and they don't use manipulation to control each other. Wife here is way out of line. \n\nNTA", "I honestly think it\u2019s more likely she sold or gave it away\u2026", "OP should get up before wife and go out on Sunday. Why does she get all this free time and he doesn't?", "We have a similar dynamic - I\u2019m more of an outgoing person and my husband spends the same amount of time with his friends while gaming. Wife needs to keep SIL out of the relationship.", "A PS5 sells for much more than 5 bucks", "Easier to control him when his friends cant warn him.", "It was probably already obvious to her how much he does.   She won't admit it because then she would have to admit she was wrong for taking his PS5.    There's a pretty good chance that she did something to that PS5 that she can't undo.   If that's the case she will do everything she can to make OP the bad guy.", "This sounds like hell. Dudes probably so wore out the best he can muster up is a strike.", "Does it say somewhere that she doesn\u2019t have a job outside the home? I read she had more free time than him but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean she doesn\u2019t have a job at all. I\u2019m not defending her. He is NTA", "call me a misogynist but if you're working 6 days a week and you're spouse doesn't have a job you should be doing almost 0 house chores. If the kid was a baby or a Toddler maybe I would give a little leeway. If I had a wife and kid and she was working 6 days a week she's come home to a clean ass house and a meal", "Why is he with her? Defo NTA", "This is a real \"I like pancakes,\" \"So you hate waffles?\" kind of moment.", "r/whoooosh", "NTA. Man on serious note I would be thinking about divorce, you work 6 days a week, do half of the indoor chores, and all of the outdoor chores. Your wife does half of the indoor chores, doesn\u2019t have a job, spends your only day off every week hanging with your friends, leaving you with little to no time to yourself. To be frank indoor chores are not hard unless you are doing a deep clean of the house every single time you clean and that would only be the case if you guys were slobs. In reality she brings nothing to the table and treats you like child, which is ironic because she herself is basically child that gets everything handed to her. Your kid is 6 years old so he\u2019s in the 1st grade and in school seven hours a day, Monday through Friday what is she doing for those 7 hours? Why doesn\u2019t she have a job? Ask yourself why are you with a lady child?", "So did she sell it behind your back? Or did SIL take it? That is an expensive piece of equipment. Give her a deadline to return it. If she doesn't, call the non-emergency number and have cops show up to get it back from her. Let them ransack the house until they find it. This is not okay. That thing is worth at least  500$. NTA", "So she is a SAHM to one child that is now in school and expects you to do 50% of the household chores? You sound like a very involved father despite what is probably a very busy work schedule. She takes off for \u2018me\u2019 time on the one day a week you could spend as a family. She then has the audacity to take away your form of relaxation. She sounds like an abuser or at the very least a user. You are NTA here", "If she's a SAHM, the kid is in school most of the day AND you split chores 50/50, it's more like SHE does nothing. And this is coming from a SAHM. \n\nNTA and get your console back asap.", "Deeeem she's a SAHM too. Yikes NTA", "Oh u/PalpitationThese7563 there is a major power imbalance in your relationship.  This is your wife/partner, not your Mother - and you are an adult, not a teenager.  The PS5 is YOUR property, and your wife has taken it without your permission.  You are within your right to demand it back immediately or you will report it stolen, and point the Police in the direction of your SIL.\n\nYour wife sounds abusive, tbh - and I say that as someone with an abusive mother.  Don\u2019t tolerate this behaviour.\n\nNTA but you would be if you don\u2019t confront your wife about stealing your property, and about her constantly getting her own way at your (literal) expense.  Also, don\u2019t engage in one more conversation with your awful SIL until she can mind her own business and stop insulting you.", "I don't know if I could forgive my SO if they did something like that. Take what's mine and give it to the person who came into my home, and you let insult me.", "This is my thought too. Always going out on the only day he could see friends? This is a huge red flag.", "100% agree!", "100% - if this was a husband doing it to his wife the shouts of controlling and domestic abuse would ring loud here and it's no different for this guy. Everyone needs downtime, how they use it is up to them. NTA.", "[OP mentions it in this comment.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1388xwa/comment/jix4rh3/)", "Apparently he says that she doesn\u2019t have a job outside the home in a response. He probably should have led with that. So he is definitely NTA", "Disagree. Being a stay at home parent is a full time job too. OP is still NTA and his wife sucks balls but still. \n\nSource: I work full time and pay for most of our stuff. My wife works part time from home. I would not trade places for the world lol. And I still do chores too.", "Lmao you're not a misogynist for thinking labour skills be divided amongst household members. I have fibro, my husband doesn't: he works, I do 95% of the cooking and cleaning normally, and he supports me on the days I can barely move (takes complete care of me if he's able to stay home). Imo, fairness is part of love, as is caring for shared concerns and nurturing a positive future together. OP's wife is not loving", "If they were experts in relationships, they\u2019d be in a happy one - not single and bitter, inserting themselves into yours.\n\nAsking a single woman for relationship advice is like asking a 3-time divorcee for marriage advice.", "Sounds like not much of a relationship when the one day OP is home from work, his wife goes out the door. He's already a single dad, might just as well dump the dead weight.", "The kid kid is also 6 years old and would be the 1st and in school for seven hours a day Monday through Friday.", "It does seem abusive and deserves better. \nMy other concern is for his son. If she can be this cold and dismissive of him his son may be next.", "As others have pointed out she\u2019s probably not hanging out with her sister", "They could be spending Sundays as a family day together. Or even splitting up Sundays more fairly like, one Sunday she goes out, the next is OP's turn and then another for family day, and hey! How about a Sunday for just the wife and OP?! \n\nYou're right, huge red flag that she'd rather spend time with her sister every week instead of her husband and seemingly, her son either.", "Not necessarily, I assume she goes out on Sundays because that's the only day OP can look after their son, any other day/evening she might struggle to get babysitting. But if she's going out EVERY Sunday with her friends then that's not fair, why can't they have a family trip one day or let OP have a turn going out with his friends. So wife still isn't treating OP equally, and especially with stealing his console that's a big red flag", "Plot twist! OP's wife was previously married and her beloved was sadly lost at sea. He was recently rescued but suffered a severe brain injury from falling out of a coconut tree while stranded on an island. He has no memory of his previous marriage. In an effort to win her first love back, OP's wife stole the PS to gift to hubby #1.", "Thanks I had to scroll down quite a ways to find that. Wow is she entitled much", "Whoa. Why do automatically associate single women with bitterness?", "Not everybody wants to be in a relationship but that doesn\u2019t mean that they couldn\u2019t make one work if they chose to.", "Yeah sister lives 8 hours away.", "This is the only logical explanation", "The best story! \ud83e\udd23\n\nWait, what about the loyal llama that saved the beloved life and now is the most loyal llama by his side? Trained in ninja skills, and is secretly stalking op? \ud83e\udd14", "That's literally what happened to Harold Bishop in Neighbours.", "This qualifies as Occums Razor right?", "Oh Jesus Christ. I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t injured yourself with all of the twisting and bending you\u2019re doing to vilify OP and sanctify his wife. I *highly* doubt you\u2019d be jumping to the partner\u2019s defence so much if the genders were reversed\u2026"]}
