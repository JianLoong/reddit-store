Basically, my whole family earns so much more money than I do (they are doctors, engineers, my cousin is a cardiologist, my uncle is the boss of his IT company which is doing very well, well, you get the idea, they are rich)\n\nI am disabled, which means that I can\u2019t work and I receive \u00ab\u00a0AAH\u00a0\u00bb from French government (disabled adult allowance) at its maximum amount, i.e. \u20ac900 per month. So I am below the poverty line and living on \u20ac900 (I have no other assistance) is really a big daily challenge\n\nObviously, my family knows it and my Christmas was therefore more modest than when we were at their house. The meal was still very nice, I cooked everything myself, from the starters to deserts to make it cheaper\n\nDuring the meal I had a lot of comments from my family who implied that it wasn't fancy enough for them. I also had comments about being unable to buy presents for everyone as all my money went into the meal preparation \n\nWhile my two cousins \u200b\u200bwere smoking a cigarette outside, I heard one of them say that \"it\u2019s like we aren\u2019t celebrating Christmas\" because they are used to very luxurious things. My other cousin replied also \u201cif I knew it was gonna be a poor people Christmas, I would\u2019ve stay home\u201d I was super sad to hear all these comments, i was saving money for few months to afford this meal\n\nI ended up saying that if they didn't like it, they could just remove me from the list of people hosting Christmas, and that frankly, given our income differences, that seemed fair to me. They said it was not equal and unfair. So I suggested that they help me when next time or bring the fancy products like foie gras, seafood, oysters etc. and again they refused because it would be unfair for them. What do you think ? Am I an asshole to refuse to host Christmas again cause they say I\u2019d take advantage from them if I wasn\u2019t doing my part\n\n\u00c9dit just so you know my menu : \n- Starters : petits fours, homemade sausage rolls roasted with sesame, Christmas tree shaped petits fours with pesto, canap\u00e9s with different spread flavours, smoked salmon with aneth cream\n- Main dish : pork roast and also a vegetarian roast made with seitan both with a mushrooms cream filling. Served with gravy or cranberry sauce, with different pur\u00e9es. Also some roasted p\u00e2tissons (like an individual size tiny pumpkin, one for everyone) filled with the same mushroom and cream filling \n- Desert : vanilla roll cake with mascarpone cream and caramel and some homemade chocolate mousse and my boyfriend who is American baked the traditional Christmas cookies that you guys do ", "created_utc": 1703597938, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18r8bpd/aita_for_refusing_to_host_christmas_ever_again/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would love to come to that Christmas dinner any day! I say that having been spoiled with amazing and expensive food myself. You have a bunch of snobs on your hands here. Ungrateful, classist snobs. Frankly you should just tell them to either buy the expensive stuff or you don't host because you won't tolerate being disrespected. This is all you can do, and unless they contribute you can't do any more.", "NTA if you agree than being removed from the hosting list means not being on the guest list either.", "NTA.  If they\u2019re going to whine about it, then they can do all the hosting.", "NTA. I'm not sure the people who complained really understand what \"fair\" means. \n\nIn this case it means everyone who hosts provides to the best of their ability and resources and you clearly did so.\n\nIf they have a problem with this then it seems like you all should switch to a potluck style going forward.", "NTA \n\n How did the rest of the family behave? Were they as rude and disrespectful? If they happy and pleasant then blast those jerks to the family and social media \n\nBtw your meal was 1000% better than ours and sounds amazing", "If they were any kind of caring people they'd have offered to bring food without being asked. That shouldn't have even been an issue. They should be ashamed of themselves. \n\nYour menu sounds unbelievable. \ud83d\udc9d", "NTA - Your family are condescending snobs, sorry.", "NTA\n\n\nYour food sounds wonderful!!!", "NTA. \n\nNext year, spend the holidays with your good friends and family and forget ever inviting the rude ones.", "Your dinner was a thought out work of art and a gift from your heart and soul.\n\nDespite being rich and successful, these guests lacked honor, civility, grace, gratitude and proved themselves barbarians.", "I so wish I attended your Christmas - the menu sounds wonderful! Your relatives are insensitive clods. NTA for never wanting to host these people for Christmas again. This might be a situation where you'll be happier (as will your stuck-up relatives) if you soend Christmas with friends instead of family going forward.", "NTA.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine living in a family where people would judge you instead of help you. That\u2019s not how a family is supposed to work.\n \nHosting Christmas costs them far less than it does you. It sounds like they can pay for the Christmas they want without sacrificing anything. You had to sacrifice a large amount to put dinner for them on the table.\n\n*They* are taking advantage of *you*.\n\nVotre anglais est bon.  Joyeux No\u00ebl!", "Nta you could have served boxed pasta and I'd still call them ungrateful and rude.", "NTA. These people sound awful! By the way, your menu sounds DELICIOUS!!!", "NTA in any way. The menu sounds incredible. I\u2019m sorry to say, but these people sound like a bunch of snobs.", "NTA. You provided them a lovely meal. If they're so crass that they can't appreciate the love and sacrifice you put into making Christmas for them I would not celebrate with them again. They're obviously completely unaware of the spirit of Christian giving. A bunch of Scrooges.", "NTA at all in any way. \n\nQuestion on the menu though: what is the French obsession with mushrooms? They\u2019re in everything. And they\u2019re gross! Lol.", "NTA, their behaviour is disgraceful and unbelievable rude. Please spend your future Christmases in a company that appreciates you.", "NTA the ungrateful AHs need to watch The Grinch and remember the true meaning of Christmas is *family*, not foie gras!", "I wouldn't eat most of the food on the menu for religious and dietary reasons, but honestly, the amount of food being served and the number of dishes is far more than o have seen at most weddings. Not to mention to me, at least they seem quite elaborate.\n\nThe cousins just seem like the sort the French beheaded. Maybe someone should remind them of the French Revolution.\n\nAlso NTA", "100% agree.\n\nNTA. \n\nAnd you menu sounds lovely.  Some folks just cannot appreciate the labor and financial sacrifice and planning it took for OP to prepare the meal for them.  I am sorry they treated you poorly.", "Money cannot buy class. What an ungrateful bunch of snobs. They do not even understand the reason for the season. Going forward I hope OP will spend their future holidays with those who matter and care. This lot is not worth the time, money, or energy.", "Your meal sounds wonderful, wish I could have been there."]}
