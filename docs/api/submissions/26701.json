Then I did some renovations to make the house more functional for the new purpose, 100% paid by me, and I started the business that I always managed alone.\n\nTo thank Tom for the suggestion, I gifted him and his wife a 3 day vacation in a luxurious resort & spa.\n\nFast forward to nowadays.\n\nTom invited me to his house to discuss something important. I drove there and he said that his son \u201cAlan\u201d(19M) will attend the university in my city and he wanted me to host him. In our country the university year starts in October.\n\nActually, I don't want Alan in my house. It pains me to say it, but he\u2019s a spoiled, dirty and messy young man.

She added that, since we\u2019re family, she expects me to be like a mother to her child and cook and clean for him.\n\nAt that point I felt disrespected. We fought, I put my foot down, said no, drove away and didn't answer their angry messages.\n\nEventually I rented the room to two girls.\n\nTom and Sara wrote about what happened on their socials and, surprisingly to me, some family members sided with them, calling me stingy and accusing me of breaking the family over money, because Tom and Sara wrote that they will no longer attend parties hosted by me and the said family members will do the same.\n\nMy daughters are on my side, but maybe just because they\u2019re my daughters?\n\nAITA?

That sort of swings things over to being a slave because you'd not be getting paid a cent for doing all this, so the only person losing out here would be you.

I honestly cost her more than the rent she charged me. If I just had to pay my own expenses instead, what would be the difference?\n\nI think you hear \"rent\" and assume they're being charged the full monthly rate of an apartment, and that does happen, but a lot of times it's a token amount to get us used to having monthly expenses.", "I know someone who lived at home for years while working full-time.  Her fiance moved in with her parents as well, and they charged him rent for several years--and then when the two of them got married, they gifted them all the saved rent money (and interest), which enabled them to buy a house.\n\nI really liked that idea!", "gr8 b8 m8", "It makes me sad that anyone would say \u201cit\u2019s a valid choice in professionalizing the relationship\u201d when it comes to parents and children.

Personal independence is a big cultural value here and it places a lot of pressure on people to get out on their own as soon as possible straight out of high school or college. Compared to that, staying at home and paying a fifth of the rent I'd pay for an apartment looks like a pretty sweet deal.", "Maybe it was the way my friends and I were raised  and the Era ...and culture.", "I dunno if I were a parent I'd rather let them live there for free so they could start paying off their debt if I was able to"]}
