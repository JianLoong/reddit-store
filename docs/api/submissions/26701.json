Then I did some renovations to make the house more functional for the new purpose, 100% paid by me, and I started the business that I always managed alone.\n\nTo thank Tom for the suggestion, I gifted him and his wife a 3 day vacation in a luxurious resort & spa.\n\nFast forward to nowadays.\n\nTom invited me to his house to discuss something important. I drove there and he said that his son \u201cAlan\u201d(19M) will attend the university in my city and he wanted me to host him. In our country the university year starts in October.\n\nActually, I don't want Alan in my house. It pains me to say it, but he\u2019s a spoiled, dirty and messy young man. He doesn't clean, doesn't do laundry, doesn\u2019t cook, doesn't lift a finger in the house. His room looks like a landfill, despite his mother \u201cSara\u201d(50F) cleaning behind him like a maid.\n\nI never criticised their parenting, because you know the saying, *\"not my circus, not my monkeys\",* but if they want to bring the circus to my house, well, that's different.\n\nSince he\u2019s family, I said I\u2019m willing to have Alan as a tenant and apply a discount on his rent, as long as he\u2019s civil and respectful, keeps the room and bathroom tidy and cleans up if he dirty something in the common areas.\n\nAfter a few seconds of stunned silence, Tom got red in the face and yelled at me, *\"how dare you ask the family for money?\"*\n\n\r  \nHe expected me to host Alan for free for the entire university cycle. 3 years at least, probably 5.\n\nSara cut in, yelling louder than Tom, saying I'm greedy and selfish, that I should willingly give them half of my earnings because the rental business was Tom's idea, so they're entitled to my money or that I host their son for free. She added that, since we\u2019re family, she expects me to be like a mother to her child and cook and clean for him.\n\nAt that point I felt disrespected. We fought, I put my foot down, said no, drove away and didn't answer their angry messages.\n\nEventually I rented the room to two girls.\n\nTom and Sara wrote about what happened on their socials and, surprisingly to me, some family members sided with them, calling me stingy and accusing me of breaking the family over money, because Tom and Sara wrote that they will no longer attend parties hosted by me and the said family members will do the same.\n\nMy daughters are on my side, but maybe just because they\u2019re my daughters?\n\nAITA?

That\u2019s not your responsibility!!!", "NTA\n\ngood ridance!", "NTA\n\nAs a woman in my 60s who lives in a university town and has rented out rooms to plenty of students, the problem is not even the rent, it's having to live with him.  \n\nLucky for you they don't want to pay rent.  \n\nAlso, the idea of renting out the room is a no-brainer, millions of women in their 60s do it all over the world.

If you're not charging your nephew anything to stay there, that's not renting, that's just letting him sponge off of you. I assume you don't need the money to survive, which might lend credence to their reaction but that's a very thin line at best. But if this isn't the case, are they seriously asking you to support their spoiled brat for three years out of your own pocket, on top of being a live in servant for him? That sort of swings things over to being a slave because you'd not be getting paid a cent for doing all this, so the only person losing out here would be you. If you're honest with yourself, if the roles were reversed, would they let one of your kids stay with them for free for three years?", "NTA. Tom and Sara where extremely rude and disrespectful. Good you put your foot down.", "NTA. Some people put rent on their own children - and apparently it is okay and even encouraged in the USA ?. \nOf course you'll charge your 3rd degree nephew.\n\nI am wondering if Tom had that idea in mind all along, but anyway, the point of renovating the room and some bits in the house to rent was the possibility to make money. It is not like you had a spare room, it is your current source of income and they have some nerves for asking you to give up your income for 3 to 5 years. \n\nBut if they want to go nuclear, go answer to the monkeys with your vision of the guy education, stressing that her mother was asking in fact to continue to mother him and so to continue to make him a unfit man for the society, unable to look after himself, a burden to his future wife and society as a whole. And you will not participate in this alienation (nor loose your income).", "NTA - And my first thought on reading this was that Tom gave the idea in the first place knowing that his son was looking at those universities, they have probably been counting on this for ages.", "I swear I thought of Uber in like 2003. You know what I didn\u2019t do? Anything else. Which is why I\u2019m still poor as hell. lol\n\nNTA. Anybody that disagrees is welcome to cover his rent instead.", "NTA.\nIt's simple.

Not your circus, not your monkeys indeed.\n\n\nThe only thing is to find a way to set the record straight.

Turn it around on them. Tell them that they can rent out rooms in their house. (Doesn't matter if they can't/won't.) Then ask how soon you can expect money from them. According to their thinking, by saying the same to them, you have given them as much as they gave you and now you are even.", "NTA. They're not entitled to your space, money, or time. Really? cook and clean for him?", "NTA they seem pretty entitled", "Free rent for 3 years?  Because dad gave you the idea?  No effing way.

If your brother suggested the supportive relative buy a lottery ticket, is he entitled  to a portion of the winnings? No", "NTA.
