Then I did some renovations to make the house more functional for the new purpose, 100% paid by me, and I started the business that I always managed alone.\n\nTo thank Tom for the suggestion, I gifted him and his wife a 3 day vacation in a luxurious resort & spa.\n\nFast forward to nowadays.\n\nTom invited me to his house to discuss something important. I drove there and he said that his son \u201cAlan\u201d(19M) will attend the university in my city and he wanted me to host him. In our country the university year starts in October.\n\nActually, I don't want Alan in my house. It pains me to say it, but he\u2019s a spoiled, dirty and messy young man.

She added that, since we\u2019re family, she expects me to be like a mother to her child and cook and clean for him.\n\nAt that point I felt disrespected. We fought, I put my foot down, said no, drove away and didn't answer their angry messages.\n\nEventually I rented the room to two girls.\n\nTom and Sara wrote about what happened on their socials and, surprisingly to me, some family members sided with them, calling me stingy and accusing me of breaking the family over money, because Tom and Sara wrote that they will no longer attend parties hosted by me and the said family members will do the same.\n\nMy daughters are on my side, but maybe just because they\u2019re my daughters?\n\nAITA?

That sort of swings things over to being a slave because you'd not be getting paid a cent for doing all this, so the only person losing out here would be you.
