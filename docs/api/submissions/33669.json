{"id": 33669, "submission_id": "18pjmlk", "title": "AITA for taking spicy food to a Christmas dinner and trying to \u201cpoison\u201d my nephew?", "selftext": "We went to in-laws house today for early Christmas celebration. Everybody was supposed to bring various finger foods and snacks. I decided to take some spicy, smoked Buffalo Wings. A bit of background is that I absolutely love spicy food. The hotter the better. By the time I even realize something is spicy, most people have tears running down their face. \n\nThese wings are spicy. I make them when I have friends over watching a game or other situations. Some friends know to avoid them entirely, but I\u2019ll usually make some milder ones also. I only made the hottest flavor today, but my wife made miscellaneous other food also.\n\nWe get there and I let people know that the wings are spicy. I don\u2019t go into more detail, but most of them have had my wings before, or know to avoid them. Fast forward to food time and my 13 year old nephew gets some of the wings and nobody notices until after he starts eating them. He starts crying and screaming and throwing a fit about the spice. He has sauce on his face and hands and even that\u2019s burning him. It takes probably an hour to get him completely calmed down, but even then he\u2019s complaining about his stomach. Honestly, I\u2019m not sure how he managed to eat so much before he realized the spice level.\n\nMy BIL and SIL are now complaining that I ruined Christmas for their son. Everything from me making him sick to ruining family pictures to \u201ctrying to poison him\u201d. I just say he didn\u2019t have to eat them but I\u2019m the bad guy because I shouldn\u2019t have brought them to a family meal. SIL was yelling at me that I should have brought mild wings because \u201cyou know how much he likes chicken wings\u201d. We brought plenty of other food to share. I don\u2019t think I needed to cater to their kids for every single item.\n\nWhile typing this up my wife has gotten more text messages complaining about it and talking about my nephews GI problems or whatever trying to digest the food. My wife is stuck in the middle. She tells me that it isn\u2019t my fault, but she isn\u2019t willing to tell them to shut up so I also wonder if she does blame me somewhat.\n\nEdit: a few comments keep appearing.\n\nI am not the only one that ate and enjoyed them. There were about 5 people, including me, that actually ate and enjoyed the wings. This is out of about 25 people total including the kids. \n\nSome of the other adults have had the wings before or at least know about them, so me saying \u201cthese are the spicy ones\u201d was enough that most people knew. In hindsight, I admit I probably should have labeled them in some way.\n\nWe brought plenty of other food. I wasn\u2019t trying to bring a single dish that was specifically prepared for me. \n\nI didn\u2019t *know* my nephew likes wings and I\u2019m not sure why my SIL made that comment. I only see this family about 2-3 times a year and I don\u2019t exactly have talks with the nephew because he\u2019s usually out playing games with the other kids.", "created_utc": 1703379228, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18pjmlk/aita_for_taking_spicy_food_to_a_christmas_dinner/", "score": 1388, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

By the time I even realize something is spicy, most people have tears running down their face. \n\nI'm not going to bother with a judgement, I'm just going to say this is not a flex, it's a sign that you've damaged your Sense of taste.", "YTA.  You brought a dish to a pot luck that was too extreme for 80% of the people who attended.  You did ruin Christmas for this kid.  This isn\u2019t the flex you think it is.", "You brought wings that were so spicy that nobody else would likely want them? YTA already just for that, food that is brought to a family gathering should be something that most people will enjoy, and at the very least won't make them sick.\n\nYour nephew made the assumption that chicken wings that are brought to a family gathering aren't going to be far spicier than the average person's tolerance to the point of causing him pain. That is not an unreasonable assumption.", "What the fuck is wrong with you?\n\nOf course YTA. You brought those wings knowing they're hot enough to make people cry, so why did you do it?\n\nYou did it to show off, you're such a man, look how spicy you can take your food. Ugh.", "YTA. if your nephew didn\u2019t know, you obviously didn\u2019t warn everyone. If it was SO spicy he was screaming in pain simply from physical contact, that\u2019s way too hot to bring as a casual meal for everyone. If you were going to bring these wings, you needed to be WAY more upfront about *exactly how spicy* they were, put a label on them. Although I can\u2019t imagine anyone besides you would really be interested in eating them in the first place, so kind of a dumb thing to bring to a family buffet.", "Why didn\u2019t you label them? Something that spicy should never just be set out on a buffet table without a warning of some sort. Even at catered events the spicy wings are clearly marked. That poor boy. I know if I had eaten some my stomach would have taken several days to heal.", "Why would you bring food to a food based social event that no one else can eat?", "INFO: was there anyone at that party aside from you and your nephew that would/did eat the wings?", "YTA. \n\nThis was a reckless choice at best. You choose to take a dish that, by your own admission, was a level of spicy that the majority cannot handle to a family gathering of 25-30 people, knowing that, at most, 5 people might touch it. \n\nYou told some of the adults, but didn't register that there were also children there. Even if your nephew hadn't eaten the wings, any one could have gotten hold of them. I don't know how old the youngest members of your family are, but imagine if a younger child had touched them. \n\nPersonally, I think bringing them at all was a strange decision and there would have been more suitable events for spicy wings that you've described are akin to an extreme spice challenge. However, if you're going to insist on bringing them, just use common sense. Put them out of reach. Label them. Let the 5 people you say eat them where they are. It is just about doing the basics here. \n\nTelling some adults in a room with a mixture of both adults and children is not enough if your wings are as hot as you say they are. \n\nJust put them out of reach.", "YTA. Why would you ever take food to a potluck that you know most people actively avoid eating? Honestly that\u2019s just kind of rude. Why bother. You are specifically taking food to SHARE- you failed spectacularly.", "\"I absolutely love spicy food. The hotter the better.\"\n\nNot really. What you like is showing off. YTA.", "YTA. You know people avoid your wings because they\u2019re too hot for them to tolerate, much less enjoy. So what sick game were you playing by bringing them?  Do you like sharing food that hurts other people?  It seems really self serving and a little sadistic to booby trap a pot luck dish. Make them for yourself if that\u2019s what you like, but bringing something so full of an ingredient that causes harm doesn\u2019t say anything good about you.", "YTA\n\nPotlucks aren't the place for people to show off how \"cool\" and \"tough\" they are by eating spicy food. \n\nYou ruined the meal.", "YTA the point of a potluck is to bring food for everyone to eat. If everyone knows to avoid the food that you bring because it is inedible to anyone but you, then you have failed at that point. I absolutely love spicy food that most people can\u2019t tolerate, but I also know it\u2019s ridiculous to bring food to a potluck that most would find painful to eat.", "YTA. Why would you bring only the spiciest kind to a family gathering?", "Here is why I think you are TA. It is not that you brought spicy wings. People bring all sorts to a potluck. You are TA because you did not label them as spicy. You knew there were kids there. You by your own words said you should have in hindsight labeled them. If you did not personally make an announcement to everyone that the wings were extra spicy then you put the kids at risk. You never put kids at risk.  Always, always label very hot foods. It is common sense and courtesy.", "YTA- while it's not your fault he ate them, you should've brought mild too AND labeled them.", "YTA for bringing food that \u201cpeople know to avoid\u201d.", "YTA", "YTA why would you bring a food that would make most people cry to eat? Especially if you knew there were kids there who might go for it not understanding that spicy to you means painful to everyone else? I don\u2019t understand why you would do that.\n\nEven if you didn\u2019t know your nephew liked wings why not err on the side of caution so no one gets sick?\n\nI feel bad for your nephew and I hope you don\u2019t do this again.", "YTA don\u2019t bring mad spicy stuff to a potluck unless there are mostly spicy lovers there, and certainly not with kids without a obvious label \u201cHOT \ud83d\udd25\u201d", "YTA. For a gathering of 25, you brought food only 5 could eat. Because you like it. I don't think you understand what a potluck is. I also think you were showing off how much you can tolerate hot food. News flash: no one cares.", "YTA - You know it", "YTA, for all the reasons everyone said.  But also, BIL and SIL are over-reacting so I am just goi g to assume you are all assholes.  Asshole family.", "YTA. \nIf you had just made a simple label \u201creally really effing spicy\u201d or something, I\u2019d be calling you NTA. It was a potluck, maybe other people love wings but not insane spice as well?", "YTA and are clueless on social norms. Its a potluck. The point is to share the food. If I went to a potluck and there is food I shouldn't have to worry I am going to burn my face off.", "YTA because when you bring a dish to share it should be palatable for the majority of people, not the minority.", "YTA for bringing something to a potluck that only 20% of the guests could even attempt to each, and not labeling it. If they really are at hot as you say, that should be labeled like you would with an allergy", "YTA for not bringing food everyone can enjoy. A potluck is about coming together to share a meal and tasting a piece of someone else's life. Your contribution seems selfish", "YTA - you brought something no one but you would enjoy. Congrats on being that person.", "YTA", "YTA-  you should always label food like that. It wouldn't have been hard for you to get a piece of paper, write- WARNING- REALLY SPICY on it and call it a day. Especially when kids are around. I went to a party once as an adult and ate a chicken wing that had some kind of scotch bonnet sauce or even hotter, and it made my stomach hurt and I had to go home. People were bringing me milk and stuff, and I wasn't a young teenager. I was pissed and if it was labeled I wouldn't have made that mistake. I feel bad for your nephew.", "YTA - I think everyone overreacted a tad but what is the point of bringing food that only you can eat to a potluck? Seems rather selfish to me. If I ever made and brought food to a gathering where the level of capsaicin could burn someone\u2019s skin, I would give VERY adequate warning to everyone, especially any children. I, too, enjoy spicy food. I make my own salsa occasionally and have accidentally made the mistake of giving myself spicy hands from cutting peppers with bare hands. It\u2019s miserable. Of course a kid would also be miserable here. \n\nNothing wrong with bringing something spicy to a potluck but the way you describe your level of spice preference, it seems like a selfish and ego-driven choice to bring those wings to a potluck.", "YTA because it\u2019s rude to take something to a potluck that has such limited appeal, especially if it\u2019s not even labeled.", "YTA. If you make some milder ones too, why would you make the super spicy ones at a pot luck, knowing your scale for spicy is higher than most people? \n\nThere was literally no reason for you to make them this spicy.", "YTA", "YTA. My dad loves spicy food. I hate it. You know what he does? He either makes mild and spicy wings and keeps them separate and makes sure everyone knows, or he makes mild and just adds hot sauce to his. Bringing food that is only edible a few people and not making sure everyone knows it is ridiculous.", "YTA. If you\u2019re gonna bring spicy food you should\u2019ve kept it separate and/or had a label for it. You said you only see this family 2 to 3 times a year, so how are they supposed to know how spicy your food is?", "YTA I\u2019m assuming that kid doesn\u2019t eat a lot of spicy food, and all the people saying the kid is being overdramatic clearly have just never experienced that level of spice. I feel like it\u2019s just plain rude to bring something that spicy to a potluck, especially without signage. I have absolutely no doubt you legitimately caused that kid pain for at least an hour, dramatic parent reaction or not. I understand a few people partook in the wings, but would it have been really that hard to just make the mild version so EVERYONE could enjoy them? Isn\u2019t that the point of a potluck?", "YTA\n\nIf you're bringing food that's THAT spicy,  you need to label it clearly. Your wife brought other things I'm assuming were more appealing to more people, thankfully. If it were the only thing you'd brought, that would be shitty. But at least label it for those that missed your little announcement. \n\nEvery dish won't be enjoyable for everyone but they should be aware and warned that something may hurt them.", "YTA. I love spicy food too but I would never bring something so spicy only 20% of the people at the party would eat. I'd just bring extra hot sauce for me and anyone who wants it.", "YTA.\n\nThere's spicy and there's \"most people can't eat this\".  If someone tells me a dish is spicy, I'm assuming it's medium to hot, not something that makes Ghost Peppers taste like white bread in comparison.  You should have been clear this wasn't \"gringo hot\" but \"melts through the table\" levels of hot.  He probably thought it was a standard level of hot and had a few before the spiciness fully kicked in.  BTW:  a lot of people love wings - why are you so surprised your nephew liked them?  You act like it was inconceivable the nephew might want some.", "YTA. Should have made the spicy and mild wings and labeled them accordingly.", "YTA- Dont bring inedible food to a pot luck. Most people dont like food to cause pain.", "YTA\n\nThere's nothing wrong with enjoying spicy food or even offering it to share, but you do need to be a little proactive about letting people know, like a label indicating that said food item is very spicy. Sometimes this turns into a food challenge type of thing, but at least those who really don't want their mouths on fire know to avoid it. That said, they might be overreacting a bit.", "YTA. Why bring something to a potluck that only a few people would eat?", "Yta so you brought food that only you would like?", "YTA\u2026..the point of a pot luck is to bring a dish everyone can enjoy.  You said yourself you can handle spicy while others have tears running down their face.\n\nSave the spice for you at your own house.  This was just a jerk thing to do. Period.", "YTA\u2026. You brought wings so hot to a potluck(an event where you SHARE food) that can cause someone\u2019s skin to burn\u2026. Wtf\u2026.\n\nAnd saying \u201cthese are the spicy ones\u201d\u2026. \u201cWas enough that MOST people knew\u201d\u2026.\n\nBy your own admission, you knew not everyone would know\u2026.  You needed to clearly describe to everyone so EVERYONE knew, not just MOST\u2026\n\nIt feels like you were purposely hoping someone messed up but got unlucky with a kid.\n\nAnd glad your wife made food for everyone, and you made food for yourself, 5 others, and left a trap on the table", "YTA.  It is irresponsible to bring something like this to a potluck and not label it.  There is a reason that spicy foods are labelled on menus and at buffets.  Your warning is not sufficient as announcing something to a large group of people pretty much ensures someone will miss it for some reason.  It is your fault your nephew was hurt and is feeling sick.  You should be feeling guilty.  You didn\u2019t need to cater to him, you just needed to keep his (and everyone else\u2019s) safety properly in mind.  You didn\u2019t.  And if you didn\u2019t even know that he likes wings, how TF did you expect him to know your wings were spicy \ud83d\ude44", "YTA - My family isn't into spicy food so when I cook for the family, I tone it down because everyone should be able to enjoy a meal.\n\nThere's no reason to bring wings so spicy that they can only be eaten by few AND can cause physical pain unless you like to use them as some sort of stupid flex.", "YTA - you just don't make the hottest level for a mixed gathering ie with children. Can't you just hold off for one night? \n\nFor those not used to that level of heat it's not enjoyable, and for a child that doesn't know what's going on it would be worse. If you insist on bringing them keep them out of reach of children.", "YTA\n\nI love spicy foods, but not everyone needs to be subjected to your spice tolerances. It can both harm them and cause serious digestion issues if they can't handle it.\n\nYou'd never be invited back again, imo", "YTA\n\nWhen you join in on a potluck,  you are supposed to bring what you believe *everyone* will enjoy,  not something people \"know to avoid\". This is especially important when there will be kids and old folks sharing in the feast. If you just had to bring your ultra-spicy wings, you should have been a lot more proactive about your warnings . \n\nApologize and make the kiddo some tasty, milder wings the next chance you get- wings he can actually eat.", "YTA. Bring food that is safe next time for everyone to eat.", "YTA. Ffs you bring food for others - not for you. Get a grip and move on. Anyone who has ever been successful cook knows you cook for those you serve.", "YTA you brought wings that 85% of human population cannot eat because they are so spicy. Chicken wings are a favorite food of just about everybody. These chicken wings were not for your immediate family; they were for your extended family. You should have made them mild so everyone could eat them. It doesn't matter that you brought other food; people really like chicken wings, so of course they're going to go for them. You also should have made sure that people understood how spicy they were.", "Even though you brought other food, I still think yta.\n\nAs someone who loves painfully spicy food, I wouldn't bring it to a gathering where there's a risk of others eating it. Just eat that stuff on your own time.", "YTA and sound like you make eating spicy shit at least half of your personality. The whole point of potluck meals is to make something that the *majority* of the people there will enjoy.", "Sorry, but I am gonna have to go with YTA. Extremely spicy food can actually hurt people. I know this because someone prepping chili for a hot dog bar at a restaurant I used to work next to, got a little heavy handed with the Carolina Reapers, and 3 people ended up in the ER.  A potluck is really no place for a dish that spicy. Simply because nobody IS  standing there to police it. What if a smaller child had gotten a hold of some?  If they had to be brought, they needed to be kept well separated from the rest of the food.   Unlike a lot of others in the comments I really feel for the kid. Some of those hot peppers can be quite painful and for someone who isn't used to it and isn't expecting it .... yeah, that would be very distressing and would ruin the holiday.", "YTA oh a WHOLE five people enjoyed your dish? You sound insufferable.", "YTA and please know that absolutely no one thinks you\u2019re cool because you eat extra spicy food. No one. Please get a real personality. Eating hot food isn\u2019t a personality.", ">most of them have had my wings before, or know to avoid them\n\n\nAs someone who absolutely LOVES spicy food, yes absolutely YTA\n\nwhat\u2019s your fuckign damage, dude? you\u2019re asked to bring a dish to a family Christmas celebration - be a functional human being just this once, and think about other people. doesn\u2019t even matter if you label them or not, the fact that you decided to bring a dish that >3/4 of the other guests wouldn\u2019t enjoy is just plain antagonistic, not to mention selfish. stick a handful of Carolina reapers in your pocket if you really can\u2019t go through one meal w/o spicy", "YTA, if it's family, you don't see often they all don't know how you cook food. Even saying these are spicy varies from person to person.  From the level of spice you seem to be talking about, that is not appropriate for a holiday meal potluck.", "Surprised I am one of the few NTAs/NAHs?  since I\u2019m coming from the perspective of someone who can\u2019t handle spicy food\u2026 but I\u2019m part of a cultural community where spicy food is beloved. I just grew up asking if something was spicy and suffering from a bite or two when I found out the hard way. I get that OP is likely not from the same background, but even non cultural gatherings I\u2019ve never been upset that something\u2019s too spicy for me. But labeling would have been a more genuine measure to mitigate risk here.", "YTA. If you bring spicy food to a potluck, it needs to be labelled that it\u2019s spicy. You can\u2019t go around to every person and be like \u201cyo, these are hot as fuck, beware\u201d. And even if you did, people are socializing and drinking and not paying attention. A label gives sufficient warning.", "YTA that\u2019s not a good dish to bring to a potluck family dinner. You made it to your tastes which you already know most people can\u2019t comfortably eat.", "YTA.  It's okay if you bring a food to a potluck that some of the people there are not going to be able to eat (unless we are talking alergies, in which case Don't).  \n\nIf you bring a food that most of them are not going to be able to eat You are The Asshole.  You even said you make milder wings for your friends. Why didn't you put in that effort for your family?  \n\nAlso, unless everyone knows about it in advance, food that causes pain in a potluck table is an asshole move.  One mistake with the potluck food should not be a ticket to burning skin, you weirdo.", "I think it\u2019s fine to bring a dish only a few people will like to a potluck, unless the host has asked for something else specifically. But I also think YTA for not clearly labelling it, because it is something you KNOW not everyone will like or might even have a strong negative reaction to. That was your responsibility.", "INFO: Was the sauce actually spicy enough to hurt if left on skin or was he just exaggerating? If yes then you absolutely need to label it and not just say it is spicy.", "Yes, YTA. If it's literally that spicy, save it for when it's just you or if you do take it, say I brought this for my enjoyment due to the scoville scale, here is a milder variant so that everyone can enjoy.  The point of a potluck is to bring food that multiple people can enjoy, not burn their mouths with and say well \"they should have known\".", "NTA - I have no idea what's wrong with these other people. (1.) It's not your job to watch their kid. (2.) Was there alcohol at Christmas? Is that labelled or do parents have the responsibility of making sure that their kids don't get into things they shouldn't? You made it clear that there is spicy food, so if the mom \"knows he loves wings\" it's HER JOB to make sure he knows which ones are okay to eat and which are not.", "YTA.  I think you are in this for the enjoyment of being known as the guy who Eats Spicy Food and you're making it your personality at the expense of basic manners and hospitality.   I enjoy spicy food but it does not enjoy me, and I have to plan ahead. I know with a single bite of very hot food that I am going to have a bad day the next day, so if I am going to eat it I absolutely need to know and \"this is spicy\" doesn't cut it.  Is it Midwestern-white-people spicy?  West Indian spicy?  Southeast Asian spicy?  Tell me the fucking ingredients so I can make a decision about how to proceed.", "NTA. You brought other food that everyone would want, so there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with also bringing something that you really like but most others wouldn\u2019t. You communicated to people they were spicy. Not to mention you can usually also smell if something is really *that* spicy. If they still grabbed it and ate them after being told, that\u2019s on them. He\u2019s 13, not 6; he should know better about things he should/shouldn\u2019t eat, especially if he has GI issues.", "NTA. He\u2019s freaking 13 not 4. If he\u2019s too stupid to realize after the first bite or two that hey these are hot, they\u2019ve got bigger issues. One single wing wouldn\u2019t cause major gastro issues. He obviously kept eating them. When did so many parents become so freaking ridiculous about not holding their children responsible for their actions?", "NTA. We're not adventurous eaters but have friends who are and they'll bring spicy stuff to our parties. Our kid and the other kids know to stick with things they like or to ask. I have never thought wings were \"kid food\". You might have labeled it better or gotten the word out a little better, but I don't think it was you actively trying to sabotage anyone.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s just some spicey wings Jesus Christ people it\u2019s not like the kid had a peanut allergy or something serious. Point of a potluck is to bring a bunch of different things\u2026.he brought something spicey.", "Im reading other peoples responses and understand that food brought to a gathering should be able to be consumed by most- you said yall brought other dishes, so OP really wanted his spicy wings and wanted to share them as well- I don\u2019t see the problem\u2026\n\nI would say NTA, but maybe label them next time to be extra cautious", "Just here to say NTA even though everyone thinks you are. You didn\u2019t just bring spicy wings to a party, you brought other food too. Yes you should have specified hey these are REALLY hot, but you did mention they were spicy. Not your fault the kid ate so much before deciding they were too hot to handle.", "YTA. \n\nOnly bring food that spicy to a potluck if you plan to label it as such and then ensure that kids can't get into it. A younger child could have grabbed it and rubbed their eye or the like. Plus it is simply rude to bring essentially inedible food to a potluck. Food so spicy it was burning his skin. \n\nAnd yes, food that spicy can mess up a person's stomach. Kids like chicken wings.

You should have said \u201clisten these are extremely spicy so if you aren\u2019t used to anything hotter than some Tabasco then you shouldn\u2019t eat them\u201d.

You don't toss it in a table without warning the parents and children.  \n\nWho do you think was supposed to make sure the kids didnt get into it?  Did you see the articles about the child who died from the One Chip Challenge?  Spicy food can be dangerous to children.\n\nYTA", "YTA. You burned a child.

Everybody was supposed to bring various finger foods and snacks. I decided to take some spicy, smoked Buffalo Wings. A bit of background is that I absolutely love spicy food. The hotter the better. By the time I even realize something is spicy, most people have tears running down their face. \n\nThese wings are spicy. I make them when I have friends over watching a game or other situations. Some friends know to avoid them entirely, but I\u2019ll usually make some milder ones also. I only made the hottest flavor today, but my wife made miscellaneous other food also.\n\nWe get there and I let people know that the wings are spicy. I don\u2019t go into more detail, but most of them have had my wings before, or know to avoid them. Fast forward to food time and my 13 year old nephew gets some of the wings and nobody notices until after he starts eating them. He starts crying and screaming and throwing a fit about the spice. He has sauce on his face and hands and even that\u2019s burning him. It takes probably an hour to get him completely calmed down, but even then he\u2019s complaining about his stomach. Honestly, I\u2019m not sure how he managed to eat so much before he realized the spice level.\n\nMy BIL and SIL are now complaining that I ruined Christmas for their son. Everything from me making him sick to ruining family pictures to \u201ctrying to poison him\u201d. I just say he didn\u2019t have to eat them but I\u2019m the bad guy because I shouldn\u2019t have brought them to a family meal. SIL was yelling at me that I should have brought mild wings because \u201cyou know how much he likes chicken wings\u201d. We brought plenty of other food to share. I don\u2019t think I needed to cater to their kids for every single item.\n\nWhile typing this up my wife has gotten more text messages complaining about it and talking about my nephews GI problems or whatever trying to digest the food. My wife is stuck in the middle. She tells me that it isn\u2019t my fault, but she isn\u2019t willing to tell them to shut up so I also wonder if she does blame me somewhat.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You deliberately made something you could pig out on without having to share with too many other people.  How much other food you brought is irrelevant.", "Gotta give the dissenting opinion here: ESH. YTA for not labeling a potluck food that many would find unpleasant, but your in-laws suck worse for being acrimonious shitheads. \n\n>While typing this up my wife has gotten more text messages complaining about it and talking about my nephews GI problems or whatever trying to digest the food.\n\nThere's the smoking gun. Their son is (apparently?) sick. You should be irrelevant to them. I don't like the sound of these people. They're bothering to try to make you feel guilty for creating a crisis in the middle of that crisis. If one of my siblings pulled that stunt, I'd tell them to STFU and focus on the crisis; we can play blame games later.\n\nMy suspicion is that there was no real crisis. Kid ate a hot wing. Kid is an idiot and so kept eating hot wings. Normal people would laugh at the kid as his tantrum wasn't over anything of any actual consequence. Normal, kind people would help the kid clean up the sauce on his face and hands. If that's the scenario, then, sure, it makes sense that people had time to be texting-- but it doesn't make sense that they'd be texting about being mad, unless they were the sort of people who just look for excuses to be mad. \n\nI'm not just reading deeply into one line, though:\n\n>My BIL and SIL are now complaining that I ruined Christmas for their son.\n\nMelodramatic! Bit of context: I don't know that I've ever said a holiday was \"ruined\" for me just because I wound up getting sick afterward. Food poisoning, influenza, flaming hot poops-- these are things that can happen. Are these dirtbag parents trying to teach their kid that nothing bad will ever happen to him?\n\n> Everything from me making him sick to ruining family pictures to \u201ctrying to poison him\u201d. \n\nMelodramatic! I don't have the energy be acerbic. Those parents sound like dicks.\n\n>I just say he didn\u2019t have to eat them but I\u2019m the bad guy because I shouldn\u2019t have brought them to a family meal. \n\nOkay, this is arguably a point against you. As you've mentioned in your edit, though, these weren't just-for-you wings; five other people appreciate them (and most people know to avoid them). In the future, though, find an index card and a sharpie, and label those bad boys.\n\n>SIL was yelling at me that I should have brought mild wings because \u201cyou know how much he likes chicken wings\u201d. \n\nI hate when people tell me that I know things that I don't know.

You sat by and passively watched while your nephew, after eating how many? wings touched his face, made no effort to help him wash his hands or give him milk, or alleviate his pain in any way. It sounds like you think that a 13 year old should have known better than to eat the food at a family dinner! \n\nI get you didn't try to poison him, but you make it sound like all this happened around you and that you had no control over it, and that's bs.

Poisoned him?  Come on.

I would, however, have created some sort of witty warning sign so that people who didn't hear your announcement (or who are not paying attention because, well, Christmas and family and stuff) had a clear warning before they grabbed a wing. \n\nThe fact that the kid did get some on his face (in his eyes?) is kinda on him. But also, not cool. I've rubbed my eyes after chopping spicy peppers and boy did I regret that. Also, if this was the kind of spicy that can cause urgent trips to the bathroom, then maybe they're not suited for big family gatherings with kids. Or they need to be put somewhere that oblivious kids can't inadvertently hurt themselves. (Sucks being a grownup sometimes.)\n\nGonna give this a soft ESH. You for inadvertently enabling your nephew to hurt himself. If you're gonna create weapons-grade food, you gotta put some safety measures in place. Your SIL is also an a**hole for blowing up you/your wife's phone phones. You didn't actually try to poison the kid, something I sincerely hope she knows.
