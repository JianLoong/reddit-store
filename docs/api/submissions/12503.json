It\u2019s one thing to beat the kids at games, another to make your brother cry at his own party.", "NTA in any way shape or form", "NTA. We need to normalize calling out bullies, **especially** when the bully is a friend. Good for you, you did the right thing.", "NTA. He definitely deserved it. Who makes the birthday boy cry at his own party? The lack of awareness in this person astounds me. You absolutely did the right thing", "NTA. Your ex-friend deserved to get kicked out for acting like a dick. He was soooooooo proud to gloat about beating much younger kids at games that he threw a toddler fit when he was asked to stop... definitely someone you're better off without.", "NTA. What was he even thinking? Mocking kids? Now that's a jerk right there.", "NTA - It is your responsibility as an older brother and host who is looking after lots of kids, to make sure everyone is safe and happy. \n\nYour friend playfully messing around with kids to make their time better wouldn't be a problem, but he clearly has an issue considering he has to show ten year-old children up (in arcade games) and make them cry. You did your job, and family comes first (at least in this situation).", "NTA. It was your little brother's birthday party, and he made your brother cry. He was bullying the kids, and he didn't want to stop. You were right to kick him out", "NTA\n\nYour friend is genuinely an embarrassment if he\u2019s picking on children in Chuck E Cheese", "NTA - sad to see what kind of a person he really is.
