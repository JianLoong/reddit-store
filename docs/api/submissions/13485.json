There are five of us sharing three bedrooms and one proper bathroom with a sink. There is a tiny living space, no dining room.

They want to move in with us so they don't need to find a new rental.\n\nI'm currently expecting and honestly, my parents and I do not have a close relationship. I was, am still, and will always be the family scapegoat.\n\nI also do not get along with my sibling as they have been raised to be the self-centred golden child. I don't blame them for this, but would prefer not to live with them.\n\nMy parents and sibling want to move in and share one bedroom. This would mean my family of five would squeeze into two bedrooms.\n\nFinally, my parents have made it clear they will NOT contribute to my expenses, my rent, or my bills. They want to stay with me because they don't want to pay for housing and utilities.\n\nThey did say that they currently have about two months' worth of frozen meat stockpiled in their freezer that they would share with us when they move in, but told me that I would have to pay for all the perishables, mainly fruits and vegetables, since they are sharing their meat stockpile.\n\nMy parents are not destitute. In fact, they have a rental property (fully paid for, no mortgage) that is currently tenanted and gives them a couple thousand dollars of passive income monthly. They are just extremely frugal and do not like to spend their own money (same goes for my sibling. In all these years, not once have they ever paid for their own meal when we eat out. Not once).\n\nThis has caused me a LOT of stress. I texted my dad a very polite message to tell him that I don't think they should move into my home because it is too small to fit five adults, two teens, and a toddler.\n\nEverybody thinks I am the AH because it is my duty to take care of my family. AITA?\n\nEdit: Just adding my parents initially said they would only need to stay until December this year before they find a place, but then the date changed to January, and then it changed to an indeterminate period of time. So that's what worries me.\n\nEdit II: Thanks everyone. I was genuinely feeling super guilty as my parents think I'm being a complete AH to not let them all move in. It really helped so much to read your support and just realise that... my parents are all about themselves, they never once spared a thought for me and how this would put such a financial and emotional strain on me, especially as I'm preparing for a fourth baby.\n\nI'm now a little worried about what they'll do next because I don't think they'll give up. Just need to remind myself to stand my ground. A part of me feels that I should just give in because it's easier. But I also know that it's true... they will NEVER move out once I let them in, and it's going to be a lifetime of permanent stress.", "created_utc": 1680104694, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125rwwn/aita_for_not_letting_my_parents_and_sister_move_in/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if you are comfortable...  that extra money could be a family vacation and memories that you're not having together.  \nPlus, courts have ruled that children do not owe their parents any repayment for upbringing, as the child did not choose to be born and require said upbringing.  \n\n-----\n\nIf you take nothing else from me, please take this- get yourself into some therapy, and learn about what healthy parental relationships are supposed to be.  You don't have that.  \nRight now you are a doormat for them.  The day you decide to stop playing that role, THAT day will be hard, the day after will be harder, but then your life will get seriously better.  \n\nIf I was in your position, here's what I'd do.  \nFirst, talk to your spouse.  Get their support and make a plan together.  I suspect they will say this is long overdue.  \nSecond, lock down your shit.  Make sure your parents don't have direct access to your bank, credit cards, etc.  Lock down your credit.  Make sure you have all your personal documents and records and whatnot.  \nThird, send your parents your last payment ever.  \nFourth, write them a NON-REALTIME message (like an email, that isn't a conversation) that for your own health and the needs of your family, the current situation must end.  You will no longer be sending them money.  The last payment is on its way and there will be no more after that.  They are not in a time of need, they are choosing to spend your money rather than their own, and that has harmed you, harmed your family, harmed your trust in them, and harmed your relationship with them.  \nFurthermore, for your own mental health, you need to go no contact for a while.  You would ask that they please respect this and not try to reach out to you for the immediate future.  You hope that in time your relationship with them can be repaired, but for now the constant demands for money and accusations that you don't do enough have caused major damage.  You wish them all the love and health in the world, but if they love you as they claim, they will give you space for now.  \nFifth, sit down with your partner and make up a budget.  Include what you make and whatever you used to send your parents, agree together on what to do with it.  I suggest half for a rainy day fund, half for a fun fund (like for vacation and stuff).  But the first one- the one that would be next month- that one is ALL fun.  Buy yourselves something nice.  \nSixth, get some therapy and learn about how to have a healthy relationship with your parents and set/enforce boundaries.", "The \"gift of life\" they gave you was a GIFT, since when do we pay for gifts given to us? You don't owe them anything. They've taken advantage of you for years. You owe it to yourself and your real family - your spouse and children - not to continue this abusive cycle. \n\nA fun line that I started using in high school after years of abuse was \"the only thing that stops me from fighting with my mother is the pain I already caused her in childbirth.\" And that stopped being satisfactory by the time I was 17 (disclaimer: I did not then begin being physical with her, I just left and never looked back).", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Do you expect YOUR children to continuously pay YOU back for giving them the gift of life for the rest of THEIR lives? No. Because YOU chose to have them. You owe your parents nothing. Please treat yourself with the care and consideration you deserve and stop paying your parents. And definitely don't let them move in. NTA"]}
