My husband, 34M, had a day of surprises for me to celebrate my birthday. I\u2019ve been telling him for months all I want is to sleep in, have help with the kids, take a shower by myself, and have help cleaning the house. I don\u2019t care about presents, a dinner, party, nothing. I did get to sleep in, but I still had to get up at 5, 8, and 10am with our 6mo. He makes breakfast for only himself. Whatever. I get breakfast made for me and the kids. I wanted to go to town with him and get some birthday freebies, but he kept insisting he wanted me to stay home because he has surprises for me to get. I was like ok cool, I\u2019ll do it another day. I asked him just to Please just hurry back. After a few hours I FaceTime him because the baby has been crying for an hour straight, my other child is bouncing off the walls, and I\u2019m just sitting there crying trying to survive. He is at a restaurant with his friends! And says he will hurry back but comes back 2 hours later. On top of that, doesn\u2019t even bring food back so I have to figure out lunch for me and the kids. I end up showering with both kids because it was the only way I would get a shower in. He then leaves again to go to my moms to work on more surprises. Finally comes back to watch a soccer game, so he can\u2019t help with cleaning or the kids and then leaves to go to town again for another surprise. I breakdown crying again because this isn\u2019t how I want to spend my birthday, I\u2019m literally spending no time with him, this day is literally like every other, and I\u2019m still getting no help. When it comes time for the party at my moms I did feel like a selfish bitch for complaining, but all of these \u201csurprises\u201d weren\u2019t surprises at all. He said I couldn\u2019t go to town with him the first time because he didn\u2019t want me to see the cake, but I picked the design so I already knew what it looked like. The surprise he put together at my moms were the presents I picked out and bought, and then the last surprise he went to town for was to pick up pizza that I said we should have for dinner because I don\u2019t want to cook. Not only that, but he was the first to leave the party because he wanted to be home to watch another game. I know how selfish this sounds, but is it too much to ask for me to be selfish for one day? \n\nAdding: on my actual birthday he has a soccer game for a rec adult league and the whole day will revolve around him. it\u2019s a championship game and they have stuff planned for literally the whole day. Also him eating with friends is normally not a big deal at all. It just bothered me today because I *assumed* he would want to spend my birthday with me.\n\nI do appreciate everything he did. He keeps telling me that I always see the worst in him and that nothing he does is good enough. But on the other hand i feel like i have the lowest expectations and he still struggles to meet them.

Time for him to come home to you with a bag packed and a hotel reservation.  Give him a weekend of no contact, go get some rest and let him think about it while managing his kids.  Your kids will most likely survive and you can rest and get some perspective.  What your husband did was sabotage, passive aggressive \u201cfuck you\u2019s\u201d all day long.

So the only thing he did that you asked for was let you have a sleep in? I understand why you cried all day. He is a selfish AH and is flipping it on you by saying whatever he does is never good enough. Don\u2019t fall for that bs. He is obviously used to doing whatever it is he wants without any consideration for you. Honestly his behaviour would be a dealbreaker for me. You deserve so much better than what he dished out.

You are nice if i were you i'd tore him into new when he walked in house without anything. Few years ago i was babysitting my nephews and niece we run out of food i was college student dont have money and told my situation to my big bro and sil they said ok.

And get a cake? \nAnd I might be a little bit blunt here. \n\nHe went out on your birthday and picking up the cake ,turned into lunch with his friends? \nTo make matters worse, you face timed him.

What you did for my birthday wasn't good enough. I got a party I did most of the prep work for when I was too tired to enjoy it from looking after our kids all day.

I just want you to be aware that it was more painful to live.\"", "\"have help with the kids, take a shower by myself, and have help cleaning the house\" are not things anyone should have to ask for as a birthday present from their spouse.

I\u2019m sure the last thing you wanted to do after that day of him being a selfish jerk was to go to a party.", "NTA. Your third sentence is very very telling. Desperately wanting those things for your birthday means your husband is useless on the day to day. He clearly isn\u2019t helping with cleaning or childcare. The most heart breaking part is that when you beg for it on your birthday, you still don\u2019t get it. If he can\u2019t be an adult or a parent for even 5 minutes and do these things on your birthday, you\u2019re screwed. \n\nI think you need to share this thread with him. If these replies aren\u2019t a wake up call, you\u2019d be better off single. You basically have another child on your hands.\n\nThe other really concerning thing is that you\u2019re thinking YOU are the selfish one or the A H. Which is insane. He is manipulating you very well. Telling you that nothing he does is good enough makes you the villain. Feels like gaslighting.\n\nI\u2019m so angry on your behalf. But not about the birthday.

Is supposed to help financially or B. Will actually have to do things during his parenting time.", "NTA, firstly I want to say Happy Birthday. Secondly, and I\u2019m sorry if this comes off harsh but it needs to be said, that man doesn\u2019t like you. There\u2019s no reason that you\u2019re married to the person you had 4 children with but you\u2019re the only one caring for them. You deserve to have an active partner not only in parenting but also in marriage and he is not giving that to you. What\u2019s also heartbreaking is the fact that after all the crap he\u2019s done to you in the past few hours, you still feel like you\u2019re at fault. You deserve better and your babies deserve better, they need to see that it\u2019s okay to not stay in a situation that is no longer serving them. I genuinely hope you\u2019re able to find happiness with yourself or someone else who will actually treasure you.", "NTA. He didn't listen to you and didn't do any of the things you asked for. He's completely self-centered and focused on doing what he wanted on your birthday.", "A husband who\u2019s a decade older than his wife being a bad husband? Color me shocked.", "NTA. \n\nYou're not seeing the worst. He's SHOWING you the worst. I dunno how you want to proceed here but this man is selfish, self centered, and just a plain bad husband. You're going to have to put yourself first, because I sincerely doubt he will in the near future.", "Nta\n\nyou need a divorce stat.", "NTA. I would be f*cking LIVID.", "Please update this when either 1) he apologises for being so useless and shows he can act as a caring husband.  Or 2) you've divorced this awful person", "Well, now you know what to do for HIS birthday. NTA.", "Surprise : \ud83c\udf89 Op has a crappy husband\ud83c\udf89\n\nNTA", "NTA i\u2019m getting so depressed reading all these AITA posts by women about their selfish shitty male partners.\n\nyou deserve the world, not whatever this is.", "Good grief he is not even doing the bare minimum as a husband. NTA", "You might \"only see the worst in him\" because he sounds like the fucking worst \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Do the same for his birthday", "No, and as a matter of fact he is very, very selfish.  You need to make it very clear that you are taking a day off, give him the date, but it in big numbers on the Fridge and do a mark down calendar and on the night before go to a hotel, sleep in the next morning and do absolutely nothing for the whole day.  Tell him you expect him to have the children feed, and the house clean when you get home.  Take WHAT you deserve.", "Nta, He's fifty shades of asshole.", "NTA! You are definitely not the one who sounds selfish! I really hope he is a good husband in general because if this is any insight into him as a human... not good! That day sounds horrible and he should be ashamed! Sounds more like he did this for himself to look good and not actually for you!", "What the fuck!? You selfish?! No. Absolutely no. NTA and dump his ass. After this also gaslighting you and playing the victim. The audacity of this man. WOW. \n\nDivorce babe, divorce.", ">I know how selfish this sounds,\n\nGirl, you are not selfish for this and dont let him and anyone else tell you other wise!! \n\nNTA. You have a crappy husband, a selfish, childish, asshole husband. You didnt ask for much and yet this asshole couldnt give you this for your birthday.\n\n> on my actual birthday he has a soccer game for a rec adult league and the whole day will revolve around him.\n\n Honestly, how many kids do you have? Why the all day have to revolve arround this child? \n\nSeems like he doesnt help you at all during the year, dont respect you or even like you much, because he didnt care about you on your birthday!! \n\nTime to avaluate this relationship, therapy, ect. You are only 26yo. Is this the way you wanna spend the rest of your life?", "NTA. None of that was a surprise. Your husband is very selfish. It sounds like you have no help at home at all. Surprise him with some boundaries and chores.", "NTA \n\nOP you have this man a blueprint with all the things you wanted and he failed. He never intended to get you the desired gifts which would cost nothing but his time. It looks to me like he is taking advantage of you and does not value you as a partner. \n\nI suggest marriage counseling. It\u2019s not too late to fix this before resentment sets in (on your part), after that it\u2019ll be a lot harder to come back from. I would also suggest you speak with a divorce lawyer just to see what it could potentially look like if you decide to pursue that as an option down the line. \n\nIn the meantime, you need to have a conversation with your husband  about expectations in the future. Him going out to lunch while you struggled at home with the children (on your birthday) when you requested a day off was disrespectful, and it appears that he has no remorse AND turned himself into the victim - the sheer audacity.", "FFS dump this loser", "NTA. It sounds like he enjoyed treating himself on YOUR birthday. Doing what HE wants rather than taking your wants and needs into consideration. You were so clear in what you wanted. And it sounds like he barely lifts a finger to help you with kids or household on a regular basis. Essentially you have 3 children and your solo parenting. I would be fuming.", "NTA, you appreciate what he did??  He did Absolutely Nothing for your Birthday.  What a selfish tool you\u2019re married to", "It requires mental work that some spouses just won't do. I'm a stay at home mom that takes care of the house, my inlaws, and stepkid.\n\nI told my SO for my birthday that I wanted to be lazy and not do anything and eat something yummy. He delivered so well it made me cry. The present from my Amazon wishlist was like a cherry on top. (We both keep Amazon lists with varying price ranges to make gift giving easier.)\n\nMy SO asked his sister to help tidy up the house so that was her gift. Made his teenage daughter clean her room before she went to her mom's.  Then bought my favorite cake and got my favorite meal and ordered food for the inlaws so we wouldn't have to cook for them (as we live with them and care for them). We all ate off paper plates to avoid making dishes.\n\nIt was the nicest birthday \ud83c\udf82.", "My ex-husband decided a gaming tournament was more important than mine. Then complained for days that I made him buy dinner that night at a place of my choosing.\n\nLike there is a reason he is an ex", "Literally OPs expectations are on the floor. The floor. And he still shovelled. If she was a single mother she would've had an easier and nicer birthday. \n\nHow shitty does a partner have to be that he makes life WORSE.\n\nGirl, I know you have low self-esteem but surely even you can see that this is not on.", "Honestly I don't get why women have multiple children this young, it's completely unnecessary and locks them into these kinds of situations. Who voluntarily give up a young life like this? \n\n\nThey're 26 and crying at home with 2 kids and enormous responsiblity. The worst thing being she describes this as \"the same as any other day\", that's horrifying!\n\n\nMeanwhile their much older husband is out playing with his friends still enjoying life as a carefree young man.", "Something tells me he\u2019d just drop the kids off at her moms house", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

So gross, OP NTA but you have to understand that as long as you stay with this dude this is what your life will be like - and I get it that you\u2019ve been convinced this is what you deserve, but don\u2019t your kids deserve better than a mom who has to raise her husband at the same time?", "And it's one thing to by chance have a conflict on someone's birthday, it's a whole other thing to spend days marketing the day as \"i have so many surprises for you! It's gonna be such a great birthday\" and come to find out the surprise is your watching the kids solo all day. And a couple hours of me time and some homemade breakfast was an incredibly easy request to meet. Husband is both selfish and incredibly out of touch.", "I'd like to argue the expectations are a bit lower than the floor... I can't even imagine just wanting to sleep in and have someone look after the kids and not even getting that...", "why are you married to this man? Like does he have money?

Ask her if your husband actually did anything towards the party or she did everything.", "Honey, your husband is selfish. He is not showing he cares about you at all. You told him what you wanted to do for your birthday; he ignored you and did what he wanted to do. What value does he bring to your life? Please know you deserve better than this and should not put up with it.", "Glad you got a giggle.  It is hard to state opinions here and this is a really tough spot she is in.  A little humor is what I intended, I hope you took it that way.", "Glad I\u2019m not the only one that instantly notices the age gap.

Of what she wanted out of the day.\n\nAnd if your day is hectic, tbh something as simple as a long shower (especially when it sounds like she usually has to bring the kids)alone, and you can actually relax.

No. But to some, it can feel like a break and a moment of peace.\nHer husband should have offered her that peace and quiet.", "Mum should go away for the weekend too"]}
