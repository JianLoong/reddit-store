My husband, 34M, had a day of surprises for me to celebrate my birthday. I\u2019ve been telling him for months all I want is to sleep in, have help with the kids, take a shower by myself, and have help cleaning the house. I don\u2019t care about presents, a dinner, party, nothing. I did get to sleep in, but I still had to get up at 5, 8, and 10am with our 6mo. He makes breakfast for only himself. Whatever. I get breakfast made for me and the kids. I wanted to go to town with him and get some birthday freebies, but he kept insisting he wanted me to stay home because he has surprises for me to get. I was like ok cool, I\u2019ll do it another day. I asked him just to Please just hurry back. After a few hours I FaceTime him because the baby has been crying for an hour straight, my other child is bouncing off the walls, and I\u2019m just sitting there crying trying to survive. He is at a restaurant with his friends! And says he will hurry back but comes back 2 hours later. On top of that, doesn\u2019t even bring food back so I have to figure out lunch for me and the kids. I end up showering with both kids because it was the only way I would get a shower in. He then leaves again to go to my moms to work on more surprises. Finally comes back to watch a soccer game, so he can\u2019t help with cleaning or the kids and then leaves to go to town again for another surprise. I breakdown crying again because this isn\u2019t how I want to spend my birthday, I\u2019m literally spending no time with him, this day is literally like every other, and I\u2019m still getting no help. When it comes time for the party at my moms I did feel like a selfish bitch for complaining, but all of these \u201csurprises\u201d weren\u2019t surprises at all. He said I couldn\u2019t go to town with him the first time because he didn\u2019t want me to see the cake, but I picked the design so I already knew what it looked like. The surprise he put together at my moms were the presents I picked out and bought, and then the last surprise he went to town for was to pick up pizza that I said we should have for dinner because I don\u2019t want to cook. Not only that, but he was the first to leave the party because he wanted to be home to watch another game. I know how selfish this sounds, but is it too much to ask for me to be selfish for one day? \n\nAdding: on my actual birthday he has a soccer game for a rec adult league and the whole day will revolve around him. it\u2019s a championship game and they have stuff planned for literally the whole day. Also him eating with friends is normally not a big deal at all. It just bothered me today because I *assumed* he would want to spend my birthday with me.\n\nI do appreciate everything he did. He keeps telling me that I always see the worst in him and that nothing he does is good enough. But on the other hand i feel like i have the lowest expectations and he still struggles to meet them.

Time for him to come home to you with a bag packed and a hotel reservation.  Give him a weekend of no contact, go get some rest and let him think about it while managing his kids.  Your kids will most likely survive and you can rest and get some perspective.  What your husband did was sabotage, passive aggressive \u201cfuck you\u2019s\u201d all day long.

So the only thing he did that you asked for was let you have a sleep in? I understand why you cried all day. He is a selfish AH and is flipping it on you by saying whatever he does is never good enough. Don\u2019t fall for that bs. He is obviously used to doing whatever it is he wants without any consideration for you. Honestly his behaviour would be a dealbreaker for me. You deserve so much better than what he dished out.

You are nice if i were you i'd tore him into new when he walked in house without anything. Few years ago i was babysitting my nephews and niece we run out of food i was college student dont have money and told my situation to my big bro and sil they said ok.

And get a cake? \nAnd I might be a little bit blunt here. \n\nHe went out on your birthday and picking up the cake ,turned into lunch with his friends? \nTo make matters worse, you face timed him.

What you did for my birthday wasn't good enough. I got a party I did most of the prep work for when I was too tired to enjoy it from looking after our kids all day.

I\u2019m sure the last thing you wanted to do after that day of him being a selfish jerk was to go to a party.", "NTA. Your third sentence is very very telling. Desperately wanting those things for your birthday means your husband is useless on the day to day. He clearly isn\u2019t helping with cleaning or childcare. The most heart breaking part is that when you beg for it on your birthday, you still don\u2019t get it. If he can\u2019t be an adult or a parent for even 5 minutes and do these things on your birthday, you\u2019re screwed. \n\nI think you need to share this thread with him. If these replies aren\u2019t a wake up call, you\u2019d be better off single. You basically have another child on your hands.\n\nThe other really concerning thing is that you\u2019re thinking YOU are the selfish one or the A H. Which is insane. He is manipulating you very well. Telling you that nothing he does is good enough makes you the villain. Feels like gaslighting.\n\nI\u2019m so angry on your behalf. But not about the birthday. About how this is your life. Something needs to change.\n\nIf you discuss this with him and nothing changes, here\u2019s what I suggest. You start acting like him. Leave the kids with him and just go out all day. Don\u2019t do ANY cleaning or cooking. Just do the absolute bare minimum. He needs a wake up call. Good luck", "He typically leaves you to care for the kids completely alone, while he goes off and has fun.\n\nHe prioritizes his soccer buddies ahead of his wife and kids.\n\nHis \"birthday extravaganza\" was to order the cake *you* picked out, drop off the birthday presents *you* bought yourself, and pick up pizza. And to use those errands as an excuse to continue not doing a single thing around the house or parent his own children.\n\nWhat exactly are you supposed to be grateful for? What are all the amazing things that you overlook and \"only see the worst in him\", because I see nothing but selfish laziness from him.\n\nYou weren't selfish at all. That you think such small requests are selfish tells me all I need to know about what kind of man your husband is. NTA, OP. And please see a counselor to help you heal and treat yourself better.", "NTA but this is his pattern and he has no intention of changing and he's even pulled the \"nothing I do is good enough\" card to turn his bullshit behavior back onto you.   So is this where you want to be in 10 years? Day in and day out, never appreciated, never acknowledged, while he goes on and does whatever he wants when he wants with no regard to you or your feelings?   If not then you know what you need to do.", "Welcome to r/badbirthdays I hate to say it but it\u2019s usually men who do nothing for their partner\u2019s birthday. Is there a single thing he did that wasn\u2019t selfish?", "NTA.\n\nYour husband sounds wildly inconsiderate of you.  Is this a pattern?  Does he always ignore  your needs?  Is he always this selfish?\n\nIf yes, I would strongly recommend going to couple's counseling together to help you clearly communicate how this is a problem and address it.  You deserve better than this.", "NTA! I am confused about what he actually did her? Because it sounds like he just left you to suffer while he did things that should have been done before your birthday and enjoyed himself. Your husband is an AH, he should have taken the kids with him to run those errands so at least you\u2019d have had some time for yourself.", "NTA", "NTA\nIt does sound selfish...  Of your husband.  He's full of his own self importance and didn't think about you at all. You need to have a serious conversation with him about his complete lack of ability to listen to what you want and to do things you actually want.", ">I do appreciate everything he did. He keeps telling me that I always see the worst in him and that nothing he does is good enough.\n\nHe did nothing. \n\nHe grabbed lunch with the boys on your birthday while you were watching your children alone like you always do by the sound of it. You set the bar really low ... Shower alone?! And he couldn't even give you that. You picked the cake. And a birthday party takes little organising, let people know date and time, follow up RSPVs for numbers, go to the shops for snacks the day before.\n\nTime to book yourself a spa weekend OP, during which he can watch the kids and you turn your phone off.\n\nOf course you're NTA but you're an AH for not advocating for yourself and letting your husband  still live his life as if he had no responsibilities and you sacrificing all who you are. How much of the parenting does he even do?", "NTA, but time to stop expecting him to do things you want.  On your next birthday, 'surprise' him when you tell him at 8 Am that you are doing a spa day and spending time with your friends and will be back soon.  About 6 PM, show up back at home and ask what he had planned for this evening for your birthday.   Repeat annually.", "NTA.\n\nNone of these should be presents.\n\nParenting his own children, parenting solo so his wife can shower, cleaning the house he lives in (not \u201chelp\u201d clean because that makes it seem like it\u2019s your responsibility only) are all things he should be doing daily.\n\nSleeping in should be a taking turns thing and birthday person obviously gets priority. \n\nTell him to step up or get fucked.", "NTA he picked up a cake you ordered, gave you gifts you bought, had a party at your mom's where she did the work, had his meals out and watched a game on TV. He didn't do a thing for you, he just did something's so he would look good to others. Plan a day for yourself,and leave him the kids. He didn't do anything for you.", "NTA, at all. Your husband was acting in a very selfish way. And didn't actually have any surprises for you, help you at all, or make any time for you", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"all I want is to sleep in, have help with the kids, take a shower by myself, and have help cleaning the house.\" .. you don't need a special brithday, you need a divorce.", "NTA", "NTA. Happy Birthday! I'm sorry you weren't made to feel special. Maybe you can tell your mom about this and see if she can babysit so you can do the things you actually wanted? I hope it works out so you can.", "on his bday leave the house. he will get 3 surprises, your 3 kids.", "Girl the bar is so low a worm could glide right over it. Wanting help with the kids is not selfish. Feeling wanted and appreciated on your birthday is not selfish. You are seeing the worst in him because that\u2019s what he\u2019s showing you. \n\nNTA.", " sorry but it just sounds like he doesn\u2019t take accountability or see any wrong in his action if his first thought is to say \u201cyou see the wrong in me\u201d that\u2019s a manipulation tactic right there NTA", "NTA.  He is doing the bare minimum so he can say he did something.   You are the housekeeper and nothing more to him.  We got a cake and a pizza for the housekeeper/babysitter.   He sounds like a selfish prick and you will be less lonely without him!", "NTA. Time for some counseling! His behavior is not okay even on a normal day. If he is going to spend the day playing soccer on one day, then he needs to be present to care for his children the other day.", "Nta he sounds like it\u2019s his world and everyone else just lives in it. He seems extra unsupportive and you deserve so much more", "NTA\n\nAnd honestly he\u2019s got you messed up in your thinking if you genuinely believe you\u2019re being ungrateful here. \n\nDude has not prioritised you and doesn\u2019t sound supportive at all - let alone to be focussed on celebrating your birthday.", "Me? I'd dump him. You're pretty much already a single mother, why not get rid of the biggest problem? Less to clean up, one less mouth to feed, one fewer person to pick up after...", "NTA but for you and your kids sake leave him. This man doesn't love you.", "NTA.\n\nGood gracious woman! Why on earth are you still married to this useless man. Honestly your expectations are so low that one can\u2019t even see it.Do yourself and your children a favor and leave this man.\n\nIf you have a daughter, you are really setting a horrible example for her and if you have sons,your husband is the worst kind of partner one can grow up to. Either way you are setting up your children to become failures.\n\nIf your husband loved you or atleast cared about you,he would have done what you asked him. You are in a marriage where one half is happy and another one is miserable.\nHow many years are you gonna live like this?", "You are a single mom. NTA", "What you describe is someone who doesn't listen to or understand your needs at all.  It sounds impossibly frustrating to me.  I don't know what you can do to get what you need from this person.  It sounds like they can't grasp it.", "Hate to say it hun but you have a 34 year old child as well, not a husband. Consider your next moves going forward because you deserve so much better than what this dead beat has the audacity to say he gave you", "NTA That's unhinged behavior from him, the time to divorce him was yesterday.", "NTA OP. Sounds like he is an additional child for you to take care of. This is not really just about the birthday, if he shows so little care, respect and consideration for you after you specifically asked for his help- what is the point of him exactly? He does not seem to respect you or even like you with these behaviours.", "NTA Your husband didn\u2019t plan a day for you. He and your mom (probably mostly your mom) planned a party in the evening. From what you write he treated you and the kids like he always does - leaves you to have fun with his friends, ignores you to watch tv and doesn\u2019t help around the house. Give yourself a present and discuss your roles and responsibilities with your hubs and get him to step up.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019d ask your mom to watch the kids for the weekend if she can, and get a hotel room for yourself.", "Your husband is a turd; you are wasting your life. Leave. Jesus fuck. Do you hear yourself? I mean do you fucking hear yourself?? \u201cMy husband treats me like shit; AITA for being sad about it?\u201d Yes. Oh my dear lord in heaven. Why do you let him treat you like this???? The fuck is wrong with you????? LEAVE! LEAVE!! LEAVE!!!!!!!!", "NTA he's awful - does he do anything decent for you? He does less than the bare minimum and then is offended you're upset!??", "NTA he\u2019s worse than useless, he did nothing for your birthday and I hope you remember this on his birthday. You may as well say you have 3 kids, hes just a waste of space", "Your husband is behaving incredibly selfishly. I\u2019m still waiting to find out the \u201csurprises\u201d\u2026 NTA", "Sorry but your life sounds like hell.\n\nYour hopes/expectations were super clear. Super clear. He just completely ignored them.\n\nI don't even know if counseling will get you what you want.\n\nAnd I'm not sure if you're breastfeeding so this might be super unreasonable but it sounds like the only break you're likely to get is if you leave the house on your own.\n\nMaybe leave the house, and a note that says you need him to take the kids and to clean up, and you'll be back when you're back. Then stay gone for the day.\n\nI'm sorry but this - the two child shower while he gets lunch out specifically- would break anyone down to tears. \n\nHe doesn't give one shit about taking care of his own kids or you. \n\nAlso, where was your mom in this? What happened when you said, I really don't care to have a party at all, but I'm desperate for some help at my house, peace to shower alone, and the kids taken care of for a day? What was her response when you told her that?\n\nNTA.", "What did he do exactly for your birthday? Picking up a cake is not a \u2018surprise\u2019 it\u2019s an errand. He seems to think doing one thing is cause for fawning over him. He\u2019s TA.", "The fact she says \"I know how selfish I sound\" is telling. Why are you selfish for wanting to enjoy your birthday?? Red flags are blinding me because there are so many! You told him you just wanted some quiet time and he did nothing to make that happen. Hung out with his mates to watch football. And is going to do so again? Absolutely NTA and get all the support you need to run as far and as fast as you can", "A selfish AH is the answer. He's just playing at being husband and father but this selfish childish man doesn't seem to have matured past adolescence.", "> Your kids will most likely survive\n\nThis made me laugh because it sounds so nonchalant about the lives of the children lol", "It\u2019s a \u201csurprise! I\u2019m a selfish jerk who can\u2019t even do the bare minimum on your birthday!\u201d kind of surprise!", "I know. Like at the end when she still felt she had to tell us she appreciated what he did I was like huh \ud83d\ude2d", "That's all I was thinking reading this, very sad", "He didn't even really let her do that! This poor woman is so overwhelmed that she calls getting up 3 times - *starting at 5 am* - \"sleeping in\" because she got to go back to bed. Letting her sleep in would mean him getting up at 5 and 8 and 10 with the kids.", "Meaning your mom planned it and he paid. Ok so he's a good wallet.", "He didn\u2019t plan the party - he answered questions your mom had while she planned.\n\nYour husband used surprises as an excuse to not be around and to leave you stuck at home. I would ask him why he is incapable of listening to you and honoring your wishes? Birthdays especially but I am betting this happens a lot and he expects childcare to be your thing.", "No honey, your mom planned the party. He didn't do a thing except tell people he did the party work to get attention. The pizza was to feed the family, including him. He didn't even watch the kids so you could shower in your birthday. He is at best a jerk", "What do you do for his birthday?\n\nDo you go out to lunch with friends during his birthday? Do you leave him and the kids for hours during his birthday? Do you sit around and watch TV during his birthday? Do you know what he want to do during his birthday but specifically ignore and deny it? \n\n\nDo you say he's an asshole during his birthday when he doesn't appreciate and say thank you? \n\nYou know the answers to these questions and those are also the answer to your question whether you are an A.", "No. He didn't even do those things. As others said, you're married. You share finances. And he planned the party? Really? You know damn well the little bit there was to plan you and your mom did it all. Because it's cake)which you picked), food (which you also picked CAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT TO COOK) and invite people ( which you also probably Did). Cause if he invited people it probably wouldn't be anyone you wanted there.\n\n\nI'm so sorry you're hearing this, I've been there, done that. The truth is, you're already doing everything yourself and when you leave him it'll be easier because there's one less person for you to worry about.", "I bet the OP's mother did all the party planning and AH tried to take credit.", "10 to 1 husband will dump the kids on her mom if she does this", "That was sad to read. She is still trying to make him seem nicer than he is.", "Considering she wanted so little for her birthday, just to sleep in, shower alone, and not have to be alone taking care of the kids while he socialized and did whatever fun stuff he wanted... I would say this is how her days typically are. All he did was pick up stuff for her birthday using their money, and it was all stuff OP arranged herself. The poor woman had to buy all her own gifts?!\n\nThis guy is a major AH for treating his wife this way on ANY day, let alone on a day they're supposed to be celebrating her birthday. He's so self-centered that OP expressing the fact she is unhappy means she's purposely trying to make him feel bad. I broke up with my ex who was similar to this, but he was still a lot more considerate than OPs husband and we didn't have kids. Any effort, even if it's half-assed and the opposite of what I communicated, means he tried and should be praised. It's not his fault that he didn't know how to do basic adult stuff or show more initiative for his partner, because he wasn't told explicitly what he needed to do, only he was and he couldn't be arsed to listen.", "This needs to be higher. OP please \ud83d\ude4f you deserve so much better NTA, and I hate how he is making you feel guilty. Suggest you leave the kids with him for the day and go have the birthday you want.", "Couldn\u2019t have said this any better!", "Worse than a third child. Kids will grow up. He hasn't", "A lot of people are just out here teaching their partners how to be a single parent."]}
