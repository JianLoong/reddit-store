My husband, 34M, had a day of surprises for me to celebrate my birthday. I\u2019ve been telling him for months all I want is to sleep in, have help with the kids, take a shower by myself, and have help cleaning the house. I don\u2019t care about presents, a dinner, party, nothing. I did get to sleep in, but I still had to get up at 5, 8, and 10am with our 6mo. He makes breakfast for only himself. Whatever. I get breakfast made for me and the kids. I wanted to go to town with him and get some birthday freebies, but he kept insisting he wanted me to stay home because he has surprises for me to get. I was like ok cool, I\u2019ll do it another day. I asked him just to Please just hurry back. After a few hours I FaceTime him because the baby has been crying for an hour straight, my other child is bouncing off the walls, and I\u2019m just sitting there crying trying to survive. He is at a restaurant with his friends! And says he will hurry back but comes back 2 hours later. On top of that, doesn\u2019t even bring food back so I have to figure out lunch for me and the kids. I end up showering with both kids because it was the only way I would get a shower in. He then leaves again to go to my moms to work on more surprises. Finally comes back to watch a soccer game, so he can\u2019t help with cleaning or the kids and then leaves to go to town again for another surprise. I breakdown crying again because this isn\u2019t how I want to spend my birthday, I\u2019m literally spending no time with him, this day is literally like every other, and I\u2019m still getting no help. When it comes time for the party at my moms I did feel like a selfish bitch for complaining, but all of these \u201csurprises\u201d weren\u2019t surprises at all. He said I couldn\u2019t go to town with him the first time because he didn\u2019t want me to see the cake, but I picked the design so I already knew what it looked like. The surprise he put together at my moms were the presents I picked out and bought, and then the last surprise he went to town for was to pick up pizza that I said we should have for dinner because I don\u2019t want to cook. Not only that, but he was the first to leave the party because he wanted to be home to watch another game. I know how selfish this sounds, but is it too much to ask for me to be selfish for one day? \n\nAdding: on my actual birthday he has a soccer game for a rec adult league and the whole day will revolve around him. it\u2019s a championship game and they have stuff planned for literally the whole day. Also him eating with friends is normally not a big deal at all. It just bothered me today because I *assumed* he would want to spend my birthday with me.\n\nI do appreciate everything he did. He keeps telling me that I always see the worst in him and that nothing he does is good enough. But on the other hand i feel like i have the lowest expectations and he still struggles to meet them.

Who goes out to lunch with friends on their spouse\u2019s birthday?!  What the hell is that?!  Especially when you have kids - birthdays should mean less work than normal for the birthday person.  Get the divorce papers ready\u2026yikes.", "Nta. He doesn\u2019t respect you. Your expectations are already low, and he doesn\u2019t meet them. He only cares about himself.", "You are NTA, your husband should\u2019ve ACTUALLY made the surprises stuff you didn\u2019t pick out or now, and make it fun for you. Not to mention, he basically had you just doing your normal daily routine with a little surprise party or whatever at the end. He saw you stressed the entire day and didn\u2019t nothing about it, even though it was the day before your birthday and it should\u2019ve been about you relaxing and him treating you right. All the stuff you actually wanted to do on your birthday weren\u2019t accomplished.", "NTA \u2013 but please tell me, what did your husband actually do for you on this day ?", "NTA. He is very selfish. He prioritised a soccer game and lunch with friends over you. Also, you aren't selfish at all. Your request for your birthday are simple and he even failed to meet those.", "NTA. Time for him to come home to you with a bag packed and a hotel reservation.  Give him a weekend of no contact, go get some rest and let him think about it while managing his kids.  Your kids will most likely survive and you can rest and get some perspective.  What your husband did was sabotage, passive aggressive \u201cfuck you\u2019s\u201d all day long.  He gave you nothing you asked for (some rest and a shower all by yourself) and deliberately went out and had a good time with his friends on your birthday!  Good luck, I wish you all the emotional strength it is going to take to navigate and survive this.", "NTA.\n\nIt's supposed to be your day and you should have the luxury of spending it how you want - not feeling stressed out and neglected. Him doing this \"surprise\" party seems more for his own gratification rather than for you.", "NTA. He\u2019s the selfish one, not you.", "NTA. So the only thing he did that you asked for was let you have a sleep in? I understand why you cried all day. He is a selfish AH and is flipping it on you by saying whatever he does is never good enough. Don\u2019t fall for that bs. He is obviously used to doing whatever it is he wants without any consideration for you. Honestly his behaviour would be a dealbreaker for me. You deserve so much better than what he dished out. Don\u2019t let him off the hook or this will be your birthday experience every year.", "NTA but there is often a reason men close to or in their 30s want to date a 20 year old - they figure you will be easier to manage as you haven\u2019t had time to be truly independent yet.  Now you are trapped with this AH.   I fail to see how him dumping you with two young children and going to a restaurant with his friends on your birthday is a \u201csurprise\u201d to you.  \n\nThis probably won\u2019t get better.", "NTA. Leave the kids with him for his Birthday. Sounds like a real winner. /s", "So you should get up early on his birthday and leave the house to plan surprises for him.   Make sure your mom and in-laws will not take the kids.   When he call tell him you are getting your nails done so you look pretty for his birthday.   Then get a massage so you are relaxed for his birthday.  Maybe some shopping for a new outfit so you look good for his birthday.  Maybe drinks with your girls friend just because.   Then meet him at his parents house for pizza.   Sing Happy Birthday!   NTA be good to yourself", "Never surprised at how low the bar is for men in heterosexual relationships.", "NTA your birthday was about you and he couldn't respect you enough to realise that. Sounds like he did what he wanted", "He is a selfish jerk, these are not surprises at all. The fact that you couldn't sleep in, and then makes himself breakfast but not for you or the kids. Then blows off your request. Of course you focus on what he does wrong. WTF does he do right. Does he help you at all with the kids in the day to day?", "NTA- he doesn\u2019t like you. He left you home alone on your birthday with the kids so he could go have fun.", "Wow I\u2019m so sorry to read this, that\u2019s awful. I mean absolutely horrible behavior from him on your birthday. You deserve a much better birthday for sure and in actuality this isn\u2019t even okay behavior when it\u2019s not your birthday. You need support, three little ones is a lot and your husband needs to step up and be present and take care of things. Where\u2019s your selfcare time? Showering by yourself? That should be daily. Really, you seem to do so much and ask for so little. You need more support girl. Also- happy birthday!", "Surprise! Your husband is a selfish AH.", "I kind of feel like YTA for asking AITA in the situation.  Your husband is selfish.  Even if it wasn\u2019t your birthday, wtf?  Why isn\u2019t he helping with the kids? He\u2019s gaslighting you with non existent surprises and then saying you\u2019re ungrateful.  I\u2019m sorry, he\u2019s a tosser.", "NTA, but I think you put too much emphasis on this birthday.  I don't know anyone older than 13 that actually cares this much about a birthday. \n\nI might suggest taking some other day for yourself, give all kid responsibility to your husband, and just go enjoy some you-time.

Why do women have literally zero standards for the men they have children with? Why are you putting up with this? What does he even add to your life?

Apparently soccer is more important  than you and sorry to break it to you \"you know this is fact\". Your husband is physically and emotionally distant. I ask you 1 question do you want rest of life live just the way it is? Neglected, not even considered? He didnt bring ANY food to you and his own kids when he fully known you guys didnt eat ANYTHING. You are nice if i were you i'd tore him into new when he walked in house without anything. Few years ago i was babysitting my nephews and niece we run out of food i was college student dont have money and told my situation to my big bro and sil they said ok. They have audacity brought nothing. Ok its ok they dont bring anything to me its not their duty but thier own kids i saw red i read all names of the book to berate them front thier kids. They NEVER did it and apologized to me to thier kids its almost same situation expect he is your husband and father of your kids. Sorry but your husband is frustrating to me.", "NTA. Your husband seems to be quite obtuse.", "Pay for the pizza and cake, then plan the party with my mom-basically", "I agree with this.  Spend a weekend in a hotel.  Do not answer your phone and let him be the the Dad for two full days.", "Pay?  You're married.  It's both of your money,  no?  \n\nSo basically he got a lunch out with the boys while you looked after the kids all day.  Then after being exhausted from watching your shared children all day so he could hang out with his friends, you suggested a pizza but the default expectation was that you were gonna cook?\n\nMy sister, this man is lazy, selfish traaash.", "Let me compare something here.\n\n\"He says I always keep seeing the worst in him, and nothing he does is ever good enough.\" \n\nOkay. He thinks he does well. But this is to make you feel bad and think the good old thoughts \"he's right I could have a worse husband\" \nOr he is truly delusional and thinks he's a good husband.\n\nWhat did he do. All day. Besides, let you sleep a bit. And get a cake? \nAnd I might be a little bit blunt here. \n\nHe went out on your birthday and picking up the cake ,turned into lunch with his friends? \nTo make matters worse, you face timed him. With a crying baby, a child full of energy and you yourself was in tears. \nAnd he couldn't be bothered to come home? But spend 2 hours longer with the guys? After his wife had been crying and was exhausted? \n\nHe couldn't let you shower without the kids? \nLeaving constantly for football games? \n\nFrom one mom to another.  \nThat is not a husband. That is a third child in some ways.\nA good husband would tell the boys, \"nah no lunch today, guys. Wife's birthday!\" \nA good husband would come flying home the second he saw you been crying like that. \nA good husband would push you into that shower and say \"honey you need a break. I'll take the kids\" \nIf this is on your special day? How is your everyday life?"]}
