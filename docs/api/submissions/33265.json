After the divorce Dan moved out from my house and we haven't spoken since. \n\nLast week Dan suddenly dropped his son at my house without giving me any warning or explanation. He only mumbled that Kate was giving birth to their second child and needs him in the delivery room due to complications. He left before I could protest and I have tried texting and calling him multiple times and have received no reply. I do not know why he thought it is a good idea as I had plans and they definitely don't involve someone else's child.\n\nI ended up calling the police and have told them what happened, explained it is not my child and I haven't agreed to look after him and his dad is not responding. They took the child and I haven't heard anything until very early hours of the same day when my ex called me calling me an asshole as the cops found them in the hospital and basically forced him out of delivery room so he can look after his child so he missed the birth of his second and Kate had some complications so she is in intensive care. He also started shouting saying that his and Kate's parents are living at the opposite ends of the country and have medical conditions which mean they can't look after his son. I have told him that he should have used his brain cells and thought about it in advance instead of dumping the product of his affair at my house, knowing that me and him are not civil, but was called even bigger asshole.\n\nI have mentioned this to some of my family and friends and while some people are on my side, others agree with my ex saying I should have looked after the kid and an asshole for calling the cops.", "created_utc": 1702893117, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18l526u/aita_for_calling_police_on_my_ex_for_abandoning/", "score": 3017, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not your job to keep the peace and make life easier for your cheating ex, who made your life harder by his cheating while wasting years of your life and negatively affecting your health. His lack of preparation is not your emergency. Since divorce, you're not his back up plan anymore.\n\nDon't want the police to treat you like a neglectful parent? Easy. Don't be one.\n\nNTA", "You haven\u2019t spoken to this man in 3 years and he suddenly turns up expecting you to look after the child he had with his affair partner?

Dad put him in that situation. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI mean, I do feel for that poor kid, being dropped off at a total stranger's house, who then calls the police and the police take him to his dad and his dad is stressed and furious. That must have been a hellishly traumatising night for him. \n\nBut *you* didn't decide to traumatise the boy like that: his dad did.  *Of course* his dad should have figured out ahead of time what the plan was for looking after a three-year-old if his mom had to go to the hospital. *Of course* the plan should not have included \"dump boy on ex with no notice\".", ">He also started shouting saying that his and Kate's parents are living at the opposite ends of the country and have medical conditions which mean they can't look after his son.\n\nBit rich of him to expect you to care about any of that, after he gave zero craps about your health. \n\n>I have mentioned this to some of my family and friends and while some people are on my side, others agree with my ex saying I should have looked after the kid and an asshole for calling the cops.\n\nTell those other friends they are more than welcome to look afte a child that's dropped on their door step, but doesn't mean you have to do the same. \n\nNTA", "NTA. \u201cMy wife is giving birth who do I trust to watch my child \u2026.

Your ex's lack of foresight and planning is not your mess to clear up. Why on earth he considered dumping the kid on you is beyond me.

If anything you where nice you could have just bad mouthed them to the kid (I would have). Also WTF to they know literally none else like neither of them have friends?", "NTA. It's not your fault or your problem that your ex and his girlfriend have no friends and the best person he can think of to call on in an emergency is an ex who hasn't spoken to him in three years.

The 2 of them should have had a plan in place plus at least one backup.", "NTA. There are people they can hire in advance for this, who get to know the child and can stay with them. If you know you don't have family locally, you make provisions. Or stay with the kid, his GF was in hospital, she's safer and probably less scared than a kid dumped with a stranger (to them).\n\nGoing to the police feels harsh, but there's no alternative beyond keeping the kid for an unknown length of time when you might have work, possibly don't have a place for them to sleep etc. The police are the first point of contact to link up with the people who can properly take care of a child whose parents can't.", "NTA, but next time don't even answer or just hang up.

Your ex has still not matured and has expected you to pick up the pieces for his and his girlfriend's failures. With health issues and travel distances, it is reasonable for the parents not to be available to help, but what sort of people have no friends that they could ask for help? \n\nYour home would not have been set up to look after a three yo. The child didn't know you and would likely have become distressed. No time was given for a proper handover of the child such feeding, sleep routine, illnesses, favourite toy if upset, potty trained. You have health issues of your own that have been ignored. \n\nThe police obviously agreed with you that the situation was unreasonable as they took the child with them rather than asking you to hold onto the child until other arrangements were made.\n\nYour ex had no respect for you when you were married and has no respect for you now.\n\nNTA.", "NTA Anyone who agrees with your ex is probably someone you don't need in your life.", "NTA you did look after the child lol, you handed him over to the people who could ACTUALLY help him...", "Nope you have no reason to look after his kid. As a matter fact, you should make a report to CPS that him and his wife Kate are not responsible parents who planned things appropriately and having tendency to dump their kids off randomly. NTA", "So ... neither of them have any friends, or work colleagues, or baby sitters, or family, and no neighbours that can assist?

Should not concern you whatsoever.", "He should've had the common sense to set up some kind of babysitting, knowing the fact that he was having a child and it's nice to be there for delivery but if you don't have a babysitter, you're stuck with your child at home because medically speaking, there's nothing you can do your child comes first yeah it's nice to be there for the delivery but if you don't have a babysitter, you have to be stuck at home. Yes she has issues during the delivery but medically speaking there was nothing that husband could do and it's not your problem, dumping a child on a stranger, even though he knew her was unethical, he didn't even have the decency to ask. It's on him and his fault and his irresponsibility as well as the mothers because they all should've had a plan and he should've known better.", "NTA. He had 9 months to figure out what to do with his kid because he clearly knew (and so did his AP) that they don\u2019t have anyone to look after the kid. Not your problem.", "NTA.

Piss off to everyone saying you should have looked after the kid as well. The audacity of your ex to even have the balls to leave the lid with you?!?", "NTA. He dropped off his toddler to what is basically a stranger to the child, and one he has real bad blood with. He is, for lack of better words, monumentally stupid.", "NTA , their child their problem. If they cannot handle that one why are they making another?  It's definitely not your responsibility to look after him.", "NTA. They had to think about childcare in advance. Nanny, daycare, neighbor, friend, coworker - anyone would be better than a hostile ex.", "NTA you can't just show up and dump your child off to someone that you once knew. This is child neglect at best. It's on him and his girlfriend to plan for these things.", "Absolutely NTA, and what a tosser to do that to you! Talk about lack of respect, lack of boundaries and total entitlement.\nYou dodged a bullet getting rid of that one, good for you for standing up for yourself. \nAnd stuff the opinions of the rest of the family and friends. Give him their number so they can be his doormat baby sitters.", "NTA\n\nYou are the LAST person he should have ever considered! \n\nThey had 9 months to make a birth plan and arrange for childcare and backups. \n\nYou are so much better off without him in your life", "At first I thought is was a kid you shared, while not ideal that you had no warning sometimes as a parent you just have to take care of your kid.\n\nThen I realised it is his AFFAIR baby?!? He was having an affair during the pandemic that resulted in health issues you are still deal with and he has the audacity to look you in the eye? Was there no one left on earth that could watch the kid? I understand wanting to be there for the birth of your kid but that doesn't mean you find the woman who's life you ruined and dump you baby on her.\n\nThe kid is innocent, but it is their father that owed them better. They didn't deserve to get picked up my the cops but it was their dad who put them in that position not you. You insured that the child was safe and would be returned to their parents, that was the right thing to do. NTA", "NTA, and ditch those idiots who called you ta.", "NTA. You're not under any obligation to look after his child. He should have found an alternative like finding a sitter to call in case of an emergency or call one of his friends or something... Not you.

There are many people capable of this job (care.com, neighbors, friends, babysitter) all of which don\u2019t involve THE EX WIFE HE CHEATED ON TO MAKE THE KID. \n\nDon\u2019t worry, Kate is probably also pissed at him.", "This story could be crossposted to the entitledpeople sub.

He is your ex, he cheated, he caused you harm over and above that. Why on earth would he drop his kid off at your house? You don't speak to him. What the hell did he expect to happen when she gave birth? He sounds like he's trying to pull the *but family* on his ex wife he cheated on.", "NTA where are their friends or other support people? They should have had all that planned months ago. \nNone of this is your responsibility or business or problem. He\u2019s delusional and insane to have done this!

Doesn't matter that this was a child with his affair partner. \n\nSure, his cheating would have made you less likely to help him. But even if you were on the best possible civil terms with him and this child was one he had with someone he met after your marriage ended it still would not make it ok.\n\nThe need for urgent childcare was a foreseeable situation that they apparently did not have adequate plans to take care of.

What a tool.", "Not your kid not your problem", "Nta, he should treat you as a stranger. You aren\u2019t his friend.

Serves him right, this is sweet karma.", "NTA. You did the correct thing.", "NTA - they could have contacted a friend or hired a babysitter.

Was the kid potty trained?", "NTA.\nYou did the right thing. Why would you have anything to do with them or their kids? He literally abandoned a kid.", "NTA as all. How is it okay for him to cheat on you, leave you, not speak to you  and then still expect you to step up and take care of his affair baby.\n\nNot your problem, not your responsibility.

The fact your considering looking after the peoples kid that literally made you physically sick as well as mentally ill is just plain stupid and screams doormat. \n\nIm guessing you have multiple people that take you for a fool in your life and you appear to love it", "Yes I remember that one I think. It was a pattern of neglectful behaviour and I believe CPS got involved after the OP called the cops. It actually worked out better for the kid because their other, non-neglectful, parent was able to gain custody, in part because of the documented abandonment at the OP\u2019s.", "This is the part that stands out to me the most. I've babysat the neighbours kids (different neighbours at different times) when something unplanned/an emergency happened. One time I drove their 5/6 year old over to the grandparents because one of the parents had a medical emergency and I personally couldn't do more than like 1-2 hours babysitting because of previous plans that could be slightly delayed but not cancelled. \n\nI imagine most people have at least 1-2 people in their social circle that could do 1-2 hours in an emergency, but for a birth they should have lined up a nanny/babysitter well in advance.", "Dump kid on nurse or maybe a waitress.

OP will watch the kids.\"  \"We are giving birth again? Let's drop Johnny and Sally off at OP's house. She won't mind.\"", "Exactly!

He clearly still feels she owes him something, although he was the one who ruined their marriage. He cannot accept there is no connection or obligation. He could go the other way and get upset at her and harass her.

The parents also had separate affairs with the \"friend\". After the child was rescued, he kidnapped her again.\n\nIt was a truly mind blowing and horrible case of neglect from both parents, the state, police, neighbours, friends, family.

Did their mother get well?", "i think the person you're responding to is right that you cannot *count* on this, though. every interaction i had with police as a child in dangerous home situations was traumatic due in part to their behavior. i subsequently don't feel that i can trust police around small children. you're right that there are some officers who behave well. but it's also true that we can't count on that being the case, and for a lot of people, the anxiety around it comes from firsthand experience, unfortunately.\n\nedit, it always bothers me when people feel the need to smother down valid grievances in this topic with little feel-good anecdotes. you have to let this sort of thing coexist.\n\nsince it's storytime, i'll share too.\n\n- watching officers brutalize my mother for \"resisting\"\u2014verbally, as she begged them not to hand me off to my father because he would hurt me. he did.\n\n- wresting me quickly and violently from under the bed, where i hid in fear from them, rather than trying to coax me out at all.\n\n- pressing me into my father's arms as i cried and begged them not to. \n\n- when i finally got the courage to report the man who began raping me at age six, they grilled me so unprofessionally that every confusing, leading question they asked me led to the entire complaint being thrown out. the man would go on to perpetrate for another 15 years.\n\n- cornering my quiet little grandmother with their big bodies and screaming into her face for expressing her concerns about my father.\n\n- pressing my mother down against the floor with all their weight, twisting her limbs, grasping fistfuls of her hair, dragging her face across the carpet, as she cried for me.\n\n- what it felt and sounded like every time they kicked in a door, too often eschewing the protocol for doing so.\n\n- the sight of my sister's father's face and its broken bones after they beat him for, unarmed, resisting. \n\n- my uncle being beaten by prison guards for trying to *get away from* an ongoing prison riot. he was left hospitalized in the prison and was so medically neglected that his catheter eventually had to be surgically removed.\n\n- the way they threatened and intimidated my mother after she was shot. they shut themselves in her hospital room and were cruel. they said that if she didn't want to give up who it was, they could only assume she was the one who needed to be arrested. she had almost died and was understandably fearful.\n\netc.", "UK here - worked in the CJ System once watched an awesome body cam video where two officers went on a call and one took the parents statements etc. Took us months to get the second officer's footage and the defence (not unreasonably) were getting very suspicious - turned out he'd spent the entire visit running round like a lunatic with the large floofy dog and screaming toddlers....", "A tea party \ud83e\udd23 brilliant", "It\u2019s nice that they tried, but indeed everything might not have turned out okay so no need for lies.", "I grew up believing that policemen are our friends.
