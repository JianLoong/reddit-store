When they come home, they usually all leave all their dirty dishes in the sink and leave the rice cooker empty (we are Asian so we always eat our meals with rice). They also leave crumbs on the floor and don't clean up after themselves.

They seem to never ask anything out of my brother who sits at his computer all day and plays video games with his friends.

I told him \"can't you do it yourself? I'm tired\" and he went \"Who am I supposed to ask then? Your mother?\" and this really ticked me off and I ended up yelling \"Whenever you open your mouth at me, its to order me to do something. Tell my brother to do it instead, I'm tired and I'm gonna take a nap.\" and locked myself in my room.

I know how hard it is to bite your tongue when you know you\u2019re right, but you have to until you\u2019re able to stand on your own 2 feet sorry you\u2019re going through this I\u2019ve been there ,do your best to keep your cool ,until you\u2019re able to get out of there", "NTA\n\nAs an Asian woman myself I'm pretty sure your parents are too engrained in gender stereotypes and that's the reason they don't ask your brother and pretend like he can't do anything. Your dad is particularly misogynistic like typically traditional Asian man who expects women to do all the cooking and cleaning regardless of if they do the caretaking and work on top of that. Your mom plays into it too even if she's annoyed with your dad or is on a lesser extent than him bc she only expects these things of you and not your brother.\n\nIncluding my household and literally all my cousins I see the girl have to do everything and the boy sits and plays games on the computer - that specific same activity as yours lol. \n\nWhat has to change is your brother bc your parents are so old fashioned it would be harder to persuade your parents to start putting demands on your brother. Now that they have you in their head as the one to do everything, they will think in their head it's harder to change things and want to keep you as the person doing everything\n\nIf your brother is truly a feminist or someone who believes in gender equality, you should appeal to him on those values. It has to be him who decides to not just sit around and wait for your parents to say something which will never happen. And it's important if he's a feminist to highlight its happening in your guys' own household bc young men can be blind to that and think misogyny is more like if ur parents didn't allow you to work or something\n\nIf I were you, I'd push back harder on your parents and not feel bad. Like say whatever you want. Men are pathetic when they can't cook for themselves and take care of themselves and expect women to do it", "NTA. Your dad has two feet and a heartbeat. He can feed and clean up after himself. He's right, he doesn't have a maid, and you aren't one either. So to answer his question of who is going to clean up after them? *He is*.", "NTA\n\nThat's some BS, you should take care and clean up after yourself and not clean at all.", "INFO: where's your mom in this picture? Does no one in the household share responsibilities? If their idea is that the women should take care of the house (not saying this is right, but assuming that's their logic), your mother is also a woman of the house, so why is he refusing to ask her anything?"]}
