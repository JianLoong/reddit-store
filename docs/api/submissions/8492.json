I am currently pursuing my degree and leave the house at 10AM and come home around 7PM from campus most days, incredibly tired because I have to commute by bus and train for 1-3 hours, even 4 depending on how busy it is.

When they come home, they usually all leave all their dirty dishes in the sink and leave the rice cooker empty (we are Asian so we always eat our meals with rice). They also leave crumbs on the floor and don't clean up after themselves. Whenever I come home, I'm met by my dad basically ordering and yelling at me to do a bunch of chores while he sits on the couch and watches TV. He always says \"you need to do it now because no one else will, we don't have a maid.\"\n\nThis has started to annoy me a lot lately. They seem to never ask anything out of my brother who sits at his computer all day and plays video games with his friends. Whenever I tell him to help me out with chores my parents always say he's still too \"little\" to do chores... but he's fifteen years old and fully capable of vacuuming and washing the dishes from time to time. \n\nToday I got into a small fight with my dad after coming home from campus because was already ordering me to cook him food while he was sitting on the couch watching the news. I told him \"can't you do it yourself? I'm tired\" and he went \"Who am I supposed to ask then? Your mother?\" and this really ticked me off and I ended up yelling \"Whenever you open your mouth at me, its to order me to do something. Tell my brother to do it instead, I'm tired and I'm gonna take a nap.\" and locked myself in my room. Later, I heard him call my brother down and tell him to cook some food,\n\nI've since been in my room because I don't want to step foot back outside.
