Autistic here. I was diagnosed as an adult, and, being a girl, I grew up analysing **everything** to just survive. I overanalyse everything, from words to phrases and facial expressions. Guess what? That helped me to become a very good therapist, to write very intense stories and taught me to be very caring. No one catered to my autism. Not at school, at home or out there when I started working. I wish I had had better coping skills and guidance at times, yes. But still I I was able to get through and I know that I am responsible for my life and deeds. No one else is. Same with him. Circumstances (including autism) don\u2019t define us.

The wording and tone is important, though. He is abusing his diagnosis. Why? I don\u2019t know, there are many possible reasons. Still, he needs to hear that you\u2019re not going to coddle him up.

Because that\u2019d be enabling a dysfunctional relationship/individual, and hurting him. \n\n\nTake a look at how many successful autistic people are out there! Autism doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doomed. On the contrary: if you decide to use it to your advantage, then you can have a very fulfilling life. It\u2019s up to him to work for that or to choose the very comfortable alternative of using his autism as an excuse to be pampered (with your family as enablers). He needs to learn that autism doesn\u2019t mean we get special treatment, it means we need to adapt/cope in another way. Now it\u2019s the right moment to help him find out strategies to actually be a functional adult soon. \n\n\nSo, in short, whereas it **is sweet and thoughtful of you to try and help make such things easier for him, it\u2019s not actually helping him in the long run and it\u2019ll hurt his development.

That comment isn't productive to a good relationship with your brother.\n\nThings that might help \n1. When you assert a boundary, try to use the exact same words every time. It increases the speed at which autistic brains absorb the information.\n \n2. Ask why he wants you to do it  - a lot of autistic symptoms are variable so there genuinely might be times when he CAN'T do the toast even though other times he can. (It usually rates to sensory processing or motor skills. Both can be affected by autism but not to the same degree all the time. Like, some days I can cook a full meal by myself and other days I have to eat plain bread straight from the loaf because my hands are so jerky I can't even hold a plate without dropping it.)\n\n3. Phrase things in a him-centric way. For example \"You have to be careful asking for things like that  - there's a lot of stereotypes that autistic boys are sexist and it puts people off them.\" \n\n4. Give clear descriptions of how his actions have affected your actions. For example \"I will not make toast right now because I am busy. If you had asked me nicely, I would have offered to make your toast when I'm done. However I will not make toast at all for someone who clicks their fingers and gives me an order.\" \n\n5. You're already doing this but to reiterate that it's the right thing - keep in mind he can be both doing something because of his autism AND being an AH.  They aren't mutually exclusive. Like... he is absolutely focusing on the \"good\" part of his diagnosis because it takes his mind off the parts he doesn't like and that deserves compassion. It also doesn't make how he treated you okay. \n\n6. Autistic people struggle with being told \"No\" because their minds aren't good at skipping steps or at having their plans changed suddenly on them. So it can be helpful to offer choices instead of just saying no and telling him what to do. For example \"I can't make your toast right now, would you like to wait until I'm not busy, or make your own toast?\" It won't always work - especially if he's being deliberately obtuse - but it will minimize the upset caused by pushing back if he's genuinely struggling. \n\nGood luck! Unfortunately, as you already correctly assessed, this will be a LOT harder with your parents enabling his bad behavior.", "So, because he takes things literally, that means nothing will ever be his fault? How is that going to work when he grows up and ends up getting into situations that can have negative impacts on others? Is that still not going to be his fault? At what point will he be old enough to hold personal responsibility for his words/actions, according to you?\n\nHe's 13 now. He's not a small child. He's becoming a teenager and is eventually going to be interested in romantic relationships and things like that.\n\nReally consider what you're doing by infantilising him in this way by acting like nothing he does is his fault because of his autism. Honestly, you're going around telling people they're ableist, but you're the one being ableist for this."]}
