I personally didn't think of it the same way as judging your brother, sorry for not making it clear. \n\nBut even though your parents made it his problem, sadly he's the only one able to untangle the mess anyways. In adulthood and frankly enough even in teen years very small amount of people care if parents made the person the way he is or not. They just care about what they see and perceive. And they won't give a fuck, they'll judge the hell out of him.\n\nThough, if he won't want to do anything you won't be able to do anything. I'd say you should try rather sooner than later.", "honestly idk if i could talk to my other family, Im not close to them at all so it would be really weird."]}
