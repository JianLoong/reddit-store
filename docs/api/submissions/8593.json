There's no reason for you to post here.", "Hi, I am autistic person. I don't like the comments here saying your brother is an asshole. They come from people who don't understand autism. We struggle to understand our roles and can have a poor sense of identity. He's not asking you to do it to make you miserable. The problem here is your parents telling him that he is not capable of doing things and that it is your job- as an autistic person he is going to take that as a fact. It's your parents fault though, not your brother's. \n\nYou need to tell them you are not a carer and he is their child to care for but please don't listen to these comments and take it out on him. \n\nAlso functioning labels overlook a lot of the struggles that those of us who don't 'look' disabled face and are really offensive as they imply some of us are worthier than others.

Are there rational, mature adults who your parents will listen to?", "The brother is using autism as an 'excuse' because his parents do. He's not doing It to be an asshole- us Autistic people only know what we know, we mimic and take things we are told as fact. It seems he's been raised to believe his sister should do things, like making toast, for him.

Ive done so much to try and understand how he thinks, Ive gone to courses about it, read books, spoken to other people with autism online, I know full well that his behaviour is my parents fault and would never make him feel bad about it. I have had chats with my parents but my dad doesn\u2019t care and my mum is too worried about starting a huge argument so just ignores it. And as for the label, he was diagnosed with that label and uses it to describe himself quite happily so I didn\u2019t think it was that much of an issue as he tells people that\u2019s what he has all the time!", "My niece has a son who is high functioning. There are some things that he struggles with - like his self-identity - but he'd never expect anyone else to make toast for him.\n\nSomehow you got put in the *caregiver* role and it sounds like your parents are okay with using you that way.

It's so frustrating when I see comments like this. We're not all comparable to each other and functioning labels are rubbish.\n\nThis situation is the parents fault - they've assigned their kids roles which is not okay. As you said about identity - if the parents keep telling him he can't do things like make toast then he's going to believe he can't do it.", "You saying you aren't allowed to get other family involved is highly concerning and indicates your family knows they are taking advantage of you in a way others would rightly protest.

We live in the Uk and this was quite a few years ago ( maybe like 5 or 6 years ago ) so i\u2019m not sure if those terms are used anymore. I also don\u2019t like the way people are commenting about him and put it into an edit.. he\u2019s still my brother and I love him more than anything and just want to help but my parents don\u2019t make it very easy", "I agree. While some people will gladly take on that role, it should be their choice. If she doesn't feel qualified - now or later - she should be able to make other arrangements for her parents. And, again this could be cultural, she should have been consulted before springing it on her.", "I'm not comparing. I gave an example from my own extended family. Please don't put words in my mouth.", "My dad believes our family issues are no one else\u2019s business, no matter how small the matter is. It could be as stupid as he hurt my feelings with a joke and i wanted to talk to my aunt about it and i\u2019d still get in trouble", "'but he'd never expect anyone to make toast for him' those are your own words.", "Factually correct but still not a comparison."]}
