If I couldn\u2019t afford a bottle, then I would\u2019ve waited in line and met my gf inside, especially if I already paid for the admission. I would\u2019ve let her go in first with her friends because I\u2019m not an insecure crybaby and I know how nightclubs work. Let\u2019s say the gf did lose her inhibitions and cheated on OP that night, then it\u2019s his own fault for being a crybaby about the situation and not going to meet her inside. Not to justify her actions or say it wouldn\u2019t have happened at a later date or whatever, but he created that situation when all she probably originally wanted was to go in with her friends and have him meet her inside. If he isn\u2019t gonna wait in line and then blow her phone up all night crying about it, then it\u2019s his own fault she didn\u2019t reply. He doesn\u2019t care enough about her to wait in line so why should care enough to leave with him? The night was about her, not him. If he thinks his gf\u2019s content of character is such that if she isn\u2019t with him or replying to him then she is automatically cheating, then he shouldn\u2019t be with her. \nWomen like confidence and they don\u2019t want to be with insecure men that are so needy they can\u2019t enjoy a night out with their fiends. I also like confident women that are secure enough to trust me if I\u2019m out with my friends. You\u2019re saying there are context clues and certain behaviors that mean she\u2019s cheating. Fair enough and that can be true. But if you read into some things too much and are so worried about being cheated on that you let your insecurities create arguments, you will eventually create a self fulfilling prophecy. OP is trying to blame his gf and start a fight because he is insecure. He\u2019s just looking for the attention he didn\u2019t receive that night. Instead of taking accountability for ditching her at the club and being too prideful to wait in line, he\u2019s gaslighting her and trying to make it seem like she did something wrong. There\u2019s nothing wrong with gf enjoying a night out with her friends before she leaves town. If he wanted one on one time, then he shouldn\u2019t have planned to go to a nightclub with 8 other people.", "The thing is, she did do something wrong. You don\u2019t see it because you don\u2019t care. It\u2019s about treating your relationship like you are in one and not like you are single. Even if this is \u201cyour night\u201d you still take the people around you into consideration, especially if that person is your gf/bf or anything above that. It\u2019s even worst because they knew that this club does this specifically to guys and yet they pushed to go. Makes you wonder what was so special about this particular club that it had to be the one. This has nothing to do with being insecure. he hit her with two texts. One letting her know he can\u2019t get in due to the bouncer trying to get money at the door. And the second being that since they couldn\u2019t get in they were going to get food. If two texts letting someone know the situation changed outside of their control is \u201cblowing up their phone\u201d then I don\u2019t know how you function when someone is reaching out to you when things don\u2019t go as planned. I\u2019m assuming\n\n Hitting some of the night clubs in Hawaii I already know how these things go, and I\u2019m not waiting 2-3 hours for the bouncer to receive word that liquor sales are low in order for him to let me in when whatever my purchases were going to be was not going to change. I\u2019m not there to buy drinks for random women if I\u2019ve come with someone already. Especially when I already paid an entry fee. That is the point of the entry fee. I could understand if it was a \u201cyou get in free before x-o\u2019clock \u201c and the club was full BUT if you pay for VIP status then we can get you in. That\u2019s something completely different, but that isn\u2019t what happened. Bouncer was gate keeping because some people are stupid enough to pay twice to enter a club. As someone who got VIP for free because I knew the either owner and/or a couple of bouncers, I watched it happen and I know how the game is played. \n\nLastly I don\u2019t think confidence was the issue in this so much as it\u2019s just a lack of care or consideration, which is the reason he is asking if he\u2019s the asshole. She didn\u2019t care, and is not a person of her word. If she wanted it to just be a girls night out, then maybe tell your bf that well in advance instead of originally planning to spend it with him, then springing it on him last minute that you want to go out to this club with friends. \n\nLastly I would argue that if anyone created the situation where she could cheat, I would say it was her. We both know how nightclubs work and their environment. If a girl is alone, she is going to get hit on. Going alone is putting yourself in a position to make those \u201cmistakes\u201d even if bf showed up later. All it takes is bf watching her flirt and get free drinks at the bar then it\u2019s all over. Because we all know again, that\u2019s the environment of the nightclub.  If he\u2019s paying attention to all the signs he would know to cut his losses and run, not due to insecurity from him, but for all the signs/lack of respect she displayed on this particular night. As the old saying goes, when someone shows you who they are, believe them", "Isn\u2019t it easy to be a female sex tourist and just about any country? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "He can says after the trip \u201cI broke up with her because she cheated on me\u201d and let everyone know", "Ok, now you have to share!", "Sorry, I will definitely get banned if I share my favourite story...

Your gf is not being considerate of your feelings.", "Definitely NTA\n\nI've had this in Vegas and Ibiza. \n\nWe always agree spends beforehand, as we both know (so does, everyone - I am a woman) that I'll get in for free. Never would I just drop my partner. \n\nThis rings as a tag along i.e. you're my partner when it suits ME! You deserve better", "They weren\u2019t not being let in. They didn\u2019t want to pay the cover charge they already knew about", "Yeah, agree. I guess I\u2019d want more information. She may have seen it as her last night with her friend group *and* her boyfriend. She also may not have realized that he saw things differently and was just focused on her, even though he was hanging out with all these other people too. **INFO: Did he make it clear that he wanted them to get intimate time together while in the big group?**\n\nWanting intimacy would be clear without any explanation needed if they were having a one on one date, but their plans involved 10 other people from the start. **INFO: Did he ever express that he didn\u2019t want a big group setting for their last night together, or was he cool with seeing her in a group, just not cool with the activity the group ended up choosing?**\n\nI was ready to call the girlfriend a horrible asshole when I first skimmed the post and thought that dude had to leave by himself. That would be really shitty. But on second read, he in fact left with 4 other guys. They could all have kept partying together at a different bar or club, and the girlfriend may have assumed that\u2019s what they would do. He had company. He was not abandoned to Uber home solo, though that\u2019s what he ended up doing. **INFO: Why didn\u2019t he keep hanging out with the other guys? Should she have known that he would want to ditch, instead of going with them to some other location?**\n\n**More INFO: when she texted him that they were going to stay at the club, did he text her back and ask her to leave so that they could spend more time together, and she refused? Or, did he text her to come over to his place later in the night (and she refused)?**\n\nIf the answer to some or all those of questions is yes, then yeah, she\u2019s a shitty girlfriend for not prioritizing her boyfriend when she knows damn well that\u2019s something he wants very much. I don\u2019t know about all these assumptions in this thread that she had maliciously planned the split from the beginning, and had a goal of getting other guys\u2019 attention without him there. That\u2019s all possible, but a little much. I\u2019d dump her though, for ignoring my wishes that she definitely knew about.\n\nIf the answers are all no, then I think she was still kind of an AH for being careless and not paying enough attention to what her boyfriend was wanting. She has some growing up to do. But if she didn\u2019t knowingly disregard his feelings, and was thoughtless instead, that makes a big difference. Becoming more thoughtful is teachable and naturally happens as people grow up.\n\nHer and her girl friends also are all AHs for first pushing the guys to do something they didn\u2019t want to do, then not offering to split the entry fees with them, and then not offering to leave and go somewhere else as a group. I think all of that is really the worst part here, and it applies to all of them. Those things could be breakup worthy- then again, another part of growing up is learning not to give into herd mentality, and that\u2019s also teachable.", "Insecure men showing their hands all over this thread.

Like, don\u2019t commit or drag somebody out with you if they\u2019re not your priority.

You've been single a while, and looking for something fun.\n\nIf you go to a $10 cover club, and strike out, how do you feel?\n\nWhat if you split a $400 table with one friend and you struck out, would you feel differently?\n\nThe guy that blew $400 is far more likely to make some desperate play (drugging a drink, following someone walking home, etc) because they end up with a larger feeling of entitlement.\n\nMultiply that by knowledge that the women got in for free, and then let him buy her drinks.\n\nDoesn't make it right (it is still sexual assault at a minimum), but any observer can see the chain of cause & event that led the unbalanced mind down the wrong path.

I\u2019m assuming that most of these people are pretty young and don\u2019t have a lot of coin and from the sound of it, it seemed like the girls might have pushed ahead in line, ubered there first or lined up earlier cuz their bfs were parking cars (not op I guess cuz he ubered). Some clubs also get packed quick and and the girls might have really wanted to get in before they wouldn\u2019t be admitted either or free admission for girls is over. If you really wanted your significant others to be able to make it into the club, you\u2019d make a point to line up with them or go to a club where they will be admitted. In my mind, the girls were already partying and didn\u2019t really want the boys around. I sense this is why OP is upset as he realizes what is pretty obvious. \n\nLike I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a huge deal in the grand scheme of things (people like dancing and it\u2019s not personal), but the idea of purposefully choosing a club that the guys wouldn\u2019t be able to get into (for whatever reason be it nefarious or benign like better music) would make anyone feel crappy.
