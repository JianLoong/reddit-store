He\u2019s more or less back on his feet now but I know he\u2019s felt a lot of financial stress. \n\nMy parents (70s) have savings, my dad\u2019s good pension and as older boomers, significant real estate equity so while they\u2019re not wealthy, they are comfortable. My mom has hinted that she and my dad helped Mark out while he was unemployed but I\u2019ve never asked any questions because 1) it\u2019s none of my business 2) my husband and I kept our jobs and were lucky to get through COVID financially unscathed even though there were layoffs at our organizations as well. \n\nSo the question: a few months ago, my dad told me that he wanted to take my kids (17f and 15m) on a big trip this summer. My mom is not really up for much travel anymore so it would be the three of them.\n\nDad\u2019s not really comfortable online so he picked the country and asked me to book the hotels, flights, etc. It\u2019s a pretty expensive place and he said not to worry about costs, so while I\u2019m not booking 5 star hotels, it\u2019s not going to be a cheap vacation.\n\nMark has started to make lots of snide remarks about the costs of this trip. I have been ignoring the comments but they just keep coming. He said the other day that I\u2019m \u2018blowing the inheritance.\u2019 He\u2019s also hinted that we should postpone so he can go. (His current boss won\u2019t let him take vacation this summer so my kids would have to miss school which neither of them would want to do.)\n\nMark likely still has financial headaches coming out of the last couple of years, and I understand there might be a certain amount of resentment towards my husband and I for having relative financial security. But this trip was not my idea and my dad is really excited. AITA for taking my dad up on his offer and spending his money on my kids?\n\n(Additional context: my husband and I are financially secure but definitely not wealthy. If we were paying for this trip, we wouldn\u2019t be able to afford a vacation for ourselves this year.

It is not your father handing out money to you or your kids, it is literally him spending a vacation with his grandkids.
