He\u2019s more or less back on his feet now but I know he\u2019s felt a lot of financial stress. \n\nMy parents (70s) have savings, my dad\u2019s good pension and as older boomers, significant real estate equity so while they\u2019re not wealthy, they are comfortable. My mom has hinted that she and my dad helped Mark out while he was unemployed but I\u2019ve never asked any questions because 1) it\u2019s none of my business 2) my husband and I kept our jobs and were lucky to get through COVID financially unscathed even though there were layoffs at our organizations as well. \n\nSo the question: a few months ago, my dad told me that he wanted to take my kids (17f and 15m) on a big trip this summer. My mom is not really up for much travel anymore so it would be the three of them.\n\nDad\u2019s not really comfortable online so he picked the country and asked me to book the hotels, flights, etc. It\u2019s a pretty expensive place and he said not to worry about costs, so while I\u2019m not booking 5 star hotels, it\u2019s not going to be a cheap vacation.\n\nMark has started to make lots of snide remarks about the costs of this trip. I have been ignoring the comments but they just keep coming. He said the other day that I\u2019m \u2018blowing the inheritance.\u2019 He\u2019s also hinted that we should postpone so he can go. (His current boss won\u2019t let him take vacation this summer so my kids would have to miss school which neither of them would want to do.)\n\nMark likely still has financial headaches coming out of the last couple of years, and I understand there might be a certain amount of resentment towards my husband and I for having relative financial security. But this trip was not my idea and my dad is really excited. AITA for taking my dad up on his offer and spending his money on my kids?\n\n(Additional context: my husband and I are financially secure but definitely not wealthy.

It seems strange that someone as selfish as your brother would come from an otherwise kind family.", "If your parents really seem comfortable saying not to worry about the costs, I wouldn't suggest paying for too much. Maybe use the money for giving the kids some more money so they can be the ones to pay for some of the meals while they're over there.

Its literally counting the money you\u2019re getting from loved ones dying. \n\nMy husbands parents recently decided to sort some of this paperwork. It should be noted that a few years ago the parents bought a big house with one sibling and her own mother. So its a house with 4 generations living there. Granny, Mother, Oldest Daughter and her kids. \n\nMiddle child (Husbands brother) has started to discuss how he gets his inheritances should mother die as you cant sell a property that daughter and her children still live in. MIL had to have a chat with my husband and his brother to ask that they please not ask the house to be sold until at least the little children were 18. Middle brother had to be placated with agreement to sell a different propery. My husband told them to liquidate everything now and live it up till they shuffle off this mortal coil. \n\nIt was such a horrible conversation to be witness to and I cant see my BIL in the same way now.", "You are not the AH.

Maybe he won't be able if you wait.", "NTA.  It\u2019s funny that your brother even thinks he is invited.  It sounds like this is to be a grandfather/grandkid trip which is something the three will remember as special.", "NTA and uh, you are not \u201cblowing the inheritance\u201d your dad is spending his retirement money AS HE SHOULD, WTF.  Tell your brother to go kick rocks and then ignore him.  Yuck", "The fact that OP's brother is already splitting the inheritance in his head while BOTH HIS PARENTS ARE STILL ALIVE, had me picking up my jaw from the floor.\n\nThe audacity! \n\nOn the other hand I shouldn't be that surprised either: I have an aunt who was doing that with my grandparents as well... I barely see that aunt since my grandparents died over a decade ago, even though she and her husband live a (literal, depending on how much strength one has in their arm) stone's throw away", "Yeah the whole \"you should postpone it so I can go\" was weird. OP isn't going, or her husband. Mark wasn't invited either. This was specifically grandpa wanting to go on vacation with the boys.\n\nWhy on earth does he think he would get to go anywhere with them?", "Right? This man is not good. \n\nMy mom is retired and getting older. She travels sometimes to visit her siblings and cousins, pays to make improvements to her home, and occasionally spends money on fun things for the grandkids. And I think that\u2019s wonderful! I don\u2019t care about whether or not I inherit anything after she dies. I want her to be happy and comfortable while she\u2019s alive. People who are more worried about their potential inheritance than whether their elderly relatives are happy and comfortable will always earn a side-eye from me. \n\nI get that OP\u2019s brother is coming back from a period of financial insecurity and that can mess a person up mentally. But he needs to figure out how to let this go and let his parents enjoy their lives while they\u2019re still around to do it."]}
