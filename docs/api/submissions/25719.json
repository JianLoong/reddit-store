{"id": 25719, "submission_id": "163pugc", "title": "AITA for calling my daughter a terrible mother?", "selftext": "My oldest daughter and I had a disagreement recently. I was very disappointed in her and expressed this to her as well as my opinion that she is a terrible mother. She believes I am wrong to judge her so I want some perspective.\n\nMy daughter was married twice. Her first husband died when their children were 9, 5 and 4. She met her second husband 18 months later and remarried after a year of dating and created a blended family with his daughter who was 4 at the point of their marriage.\n\nMy oldest grandson was destroyed by his dad's death. He was in therapy from the point of his dad's death, something my husband and I had to pressure our daughter to seek because she was focused more on moving forward. But our grandson was hardly eating or sleeping and had difficulty in school. My daughter thanked me later for giving her the push. When my grandson started therapy he was asked to keep a diary to help him. It was something that took him several months to use more than once a month but he did grow to use it a lot. This diary was something for his eyes only. Not even the therapist read it. They just discussed anything he wished to.\n\nMy daughter had more children with her second husband and things were fine. When my grandson decided he wanted to attend college locally he asked if he could live with my husband and myself and we agreed. He moved in with us in mid June.\n\nAbout a month later I noticed something was going on but I had no idea what. My other two grandchildren from my daughter's first marriage told me that their mom and brother were fighting because their mom had stolen his therapy diary while they were visiting us and that she was angry about it's contents. She was also mad at them because they defended their brother.\n\nI spoke to my grandson who was both angry and sad. He told me his mom was never supposed to read those. I spoke to my daughter next. She ranted at me about how my grandson had written about her husband and other children, including her stepdaughter. She said he never wanted her to move on. That he had wanted her to be alone forever. That he didn't even love his much younger siblings, just the two from her marriage to his dad. She said she couldn't look at him. I asked her if it was true she stole the diary. She was stunned I would ask and told me I should be focused more on the contents, especially when some of it was written right before he moved in with me. I told her it was kept in a diary and never vocalized to any of them. She said that didn't matter and I said it did. She told me I should be on her side. That he should be shunned for writing so many awful things. This is when I expressed my disappointment in her and called her a terrible mother.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693238141, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163pugc/aita_for_calling_my_daughter_a_terrible_mother/", "score": 208, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She stole her sons diary and then read through his private thoughts.  And now she wants the entire family to shun him because she couldn't force him to drink the koolaid of her \"perfect blended family\"!!!  Pathetic.", "Yikes NTA. She's probably undone years of therapy right there and has the audacity to be mad at the poor kid.... None of her children will trust her going forward.", "NTA If the shoe fits...Your daughter did a terrible  thing. She invaded her son's privacy and made his recovery and journey through the grief of the loss of his father all about herself. She tried to weaponize his private thoughts to use against him. No one is going to pat her on the back for what she did or nominate her for Mother of the Year. Her actions and subsequent reaction were awful. In these moment she was a terrible mother and a disappointment.", "NTA  \nShe does sound terrible.  \nShe is taking personal offense to something her kid had the right to complain about.  \nShe is also refusing responsibility on both the decisions she took regarding their family and also the decision she took by stealing the diary.", "He didn\u2019t want her to move on? Way to make your kids trauma all about you. She is being terrible, hope you can talk her into some family therapy.", "NTA. My mom read my diary once when I was a kid. She didn\u2019t like the contents either. Im now 33 and have never written down my thoughts since that day and struggle with trust issues, boundaries, and privacy. I also am no contact with my mother. Tell your daughter this is what her future looks like.", "Nta, she sure fucked up that poor kid. You are 100% right. What a horrid invasion of privacy, and I wouldn't be surprised if he never spoke to her again. Sure smells of narcissistic behavior. We can only hope she gets therapy herself, realizes the extent of her behavior and changes for the better.", "when you are right you are right.  \n\n\n  \nNTA", "NTA\n\nWow is your daughter though. That's awful.", "NTA. You GO, grandma OR grandpa! Your grandson is so lucky to have you. A parent should never read their child's diary. Especially not a therapy one. She overstepped a huge boundary. He was a young man feeling a lot of feelings, and it seems it own mother didn't do much to help him. She has no right to be angry at her child's very valid emotions. I feel so bad for him right now. Hugs to you.", "NTA\n\nYou spoke the truth.  She is.\n\nConcentrate on helping your grandson overcome her betrayal.\n\nYou need to go limited contact with her to send your oldest grandson the message that you have his back.\n\nIt's also possible you might end up with the other two children at some point, so prepare yourself.\n\nHugs and Good Luck", "NTA, for telling the truth.  Jesus Christ she\u2019s horrible for what she did!", "NTA\n\nShe had absolutely no right to do that, and her reaction to what she learned when she did it is proving the truth of your words. The poor kid!", "NTA, you aren't wrong.", "You shouldn't blame yourself for telling the truth. NTA", "NTA.", " NTA", "NTA, and this is why you stay out of others peoples belonging, what you write in a diary is to get it out of your headspace. Keep sticking up for your grandson, he is in for a tough time with his mother.", "She moved on and never dealt with her grieving son. Of course he has anger that has built up needing release...the diary helped it. Mom is a crappy mom. Awesome he'll be with your while in college. NTA.", "NTA. Diaries are meant to be a private place to put your thoughts and feelings that you don't want to express to anyone else and don't want out in the world. She went over the line when she invaded his privacy and instead of realizing she did the wrong thing she is focusing on the parts of the diary that hurt her feelings and didn't validate the choices she made for her and her children. If she was a young woman again and she had gone through a terrible loss, would she want someone invading her privacy like she did to him? She sounds selfish and entitled and while that might not be enough to call her a \"terrible mother\", she did wrong and she needs to own what she did.", "NTA and you are being a really supportive grandparent. Good on you!", "NTA.  I encourage my daughter, who is 10, to keep a diary and I would never dream of violating her privacy. She's entitled to her feelings and should be able to express them in a healthy way. Your daughter violated your son's trust and I feel so bad for him.", "NTA Your daughter needs to learn how to respect boundaries.", "NTA What a horrid mother, just plain nasty. Congratulate her though, she has single-handedly caused her child to hate her and I wouldn't blame him. I doubt he will be sticking around her after graduation.", "NTA, she definitely is being a terrible mother. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re supporting your grandson in all this, he needs someone in his corner right now.", "Not the asshole.  Journals are where you work thru feelings, like he did as a sad and scared child. \n\nIt's a massive breach of trust to read them and then try to punish him for that.  She is awful.", "NTA Diaries like that are meant to be places where you can write out all the thoughts in your head, whether they're kind or not. It's a great way to express feelings without worrying about hurting anyone. This only works if it's private. \n\nMy 28-year-old niece is living with me till she's more mentally stable. I asked her if she writes in a journal and she said she can't. Every time she tries, she remembers how her mom read her secret, hidden diary when she was a teen and used it to insult her. c-PTSD is rough. \n\nDon't invade your kid's privacy, y'all.", "NTA. While that's a harsh thing to say to your child, I think your daughter needs a wake up call. It's not ok to read your child's diary in general, but to read a *therapy* diary is an especially huge violation. I'm glad you're supporting your grandson. He needs someone on his side.", "And the worst part is he never treated any of the children poorly or even that differently. Subtle, very minor differences, yes. But he did his best to still be kind to all the children. So his diary was his way of keeping others from being hurt.\n\nMy daughter's actions have left me incredibly upset. I would like to think we taught her better than this.", "[removed]", "She's also holding onto all of this. I hear from two of my grandchildren that she continues to blame her brother and has openly discussed what he wrote. Which means she hurt her stepdaughter and her younger children with her actions too.", "I think it's far too late for family therapy now. Her actions have possibly ruined any chance for her to repair her relationship with the oldest and perhaps even the other two children from her first marriage.", "I'm so very sorry this happened to you. I cannot understand a parent doing this.", "I\u2018m really sorry she did that :( its absolutely immoral wtf", "So far my grandson has been ignoring any calls or texts from her. I hope he continues to do so, at least for now.", "What a mess. It seems like she's hellbent of causing as much damage as she can. All you can do, is remain supportive of your grandchildren.", "Does she still have the diary or did she give it back? If she still has it she should be made to return it. And I would raise holy hell until it\u2019s returned.\n\nNTA", "If I were the other 2, I would not trust your daughter at all.  Literally become mute around her because it sounds like if she doesn't like what you say, you will be shunned.  WTF is she thinking?", "She still has it. My grandson requested I don't force her to return it. I want to though.", "NTA so many stories here about parents who want to play happy families so badly they ignore their own children's feelings about the situation.  \n\nI'm glad he has you and your husband.", "NTA - although I was far from that just reading your title.  Someone's journal is a release for emotions and thoughts they have at that time - she's going to hold the thoughts of a 9/10/11 year old, just taking three years of his life there - against him as an adult?  I'm pretty sure i had some fairly awful thoughts about my parents/siblings during those years, often dependent upon whether or not I had to wash the dishes.  That doesn't mean I actually, truly, wanted something awful to happen to them or didn't love them .  She's being ridiculous, and it was a terrible betrayal of him to take his journal and read it.", "NTA. She is a terrible mother. She stole her sons confidential therapy diary and is butt hurt because her vision of the perfect family is shattered. Everything she thought she knew about her son and his feelings is a lie. She put her wants and needs above her child and now she has to pay the price. She will be lucky if he ever speaks to her again.\n\nI'm glad he has you and your husband to support him through this shit show. He sounds like a remarkable young man considering everything he has gone through in his life.", "NTA\n\nShe violated her son's privacy. SHE should be shunned.", "Reason 4678643388 to never keep a diary", "Sorry, YTA.  True, stealing the diary was a horrible thing to do and using her son\u2019s private thoughts against him is inexcusable.  Her son may never get over his father\u2019s death and the speed at which his mother replaced his father & brought in step kids and that is his choice.  Everyone heals at their own pace.  But you, attacking her years of motherhood to multiple children, is a blemish on your own motherhood, indeed.  You owe your daughter an apology for your overreaction, but not for the theft of the diary, that was super shitty.", "NTA, your grandchildren are blessed to have you. If your daughter can put her own self interests aside she will see this, too.", "NTA. You stated the facts.", "NTA, sorry but your daughter is insane and wrong on so many levels. She also just probably destroyed her relationship with all of her because of this.", "NTA", "nta - your daughter had absolutely no right to invade his privacy like that and on top of it to double down that she did nothing wrong.  \n\ngive your grandson a hug he turned out amazing all things considered with the obstacles he faced.  he also might be better off if he goes no contact with his mother in order to concentrate on the life he wishes to have.", "NTA.", "NTA. Your daughter is being an absolute monster in this situation. The fact that she even had the audacity to read that journal is bad enough, but then to make an issue of what was said it in and expect people to take her side. Wow. Just fucking... wow. Definitely not the AH and your daughter needs to be in therapy or she's going to lose her relationships with all her children eventually.", "Oh nooooooo, that poor, poor boy. You are NTA and I feel so bad for him. What a horrible thing for her to do.", "Definitely NTA. Your daughter has proven that she's a thief for stealing his therapy diary, a manipulator for trying to twist the subject from stealing to the contents, and she can't be trusted. I wouldn't be surprised if your grandchildren from your daughter's first marriage wants nothing to do with her.", "> I asked her if it was true she stole the diary. She was stunned I would ask and told me I should be focused more on the contents, especially when some of it was written right before he moved in with me.\n\nAbsolutely not. The real issue is her stealing his diary and massively violating his trust and boundaries. \n\nIt doesn't matter what was written in it - that was for him alone to read and a good way to process his feelings. Many people keep diaries as it's very cathartic to see stuff written down instead of keeping it swirling in your head where it gets muddled and side tracked.\n\nThat your daughter can't even acknowledge what she did was wrong, makes her a massive AH.  \n\n\nYou are NTA for calling her out for this (although  you could have communicated it better maybe).", "Stealing the diary is the most disrespectful thing she could have done.  She invaded his privacy.  I won't be surprised if he never trusts his mother again.  She is a fool if she doesn't realize this.  She needs to own up to what she did, not turn it around on her son.  You are right, she IS a terrible mother.  I doubt she even took the time to think about why her son feels the way he does.  It's all about HER.  She is an AH.", "NTA\n\nTell her this. \n\n I hate what you did and you'll never have my sympathy. Do what you want, cry yourself to sleep like the entitled baby you are. The fact is that you are a bad parent and a hypocrite. Can you truly say you've spent your whole life not having one bad thought about anyone? Your son's diary was his personal outlet, not your People magazine. He owes you nothing and I owe you nothing.", "NTA at all", "Yes, your daughter is a terrible mom to betray his trust like she did.  NTAH.", "She not only read the journal not meant for her eyes...she is now telling OP and her second and third children what is in the journal. So, now basically 4 people have \"read\" the journal (albeit 3 of them against their will).", "Same thing happened to me as a kid. I got punished for what I wrote in my diary when I was like six. After that I could never keep a journal again, I tried but there was too much fear involved if it was found. Even now, I\u2019ve been living on my own for a decade, been in therapy for most of that and I still can\u2019t keep a diary. I have tried keeping them for therapy and it ends up being more stressful than it\u2019s worth.", "I'm furious on your grandson's behalf. Those were his private thoughts. She had no right. You're NTA and I hope you're able to continue to support him and your other grandchildren (specifically the older ones) because you're doing an amazing job so far!", "NTA and thank you for being a wonderful grandparent and supporting your grandson in this matter. A diary like that is meant to vent those dark thoughts that we sometimes have and often hate ourselves for so that they don\u2019t come out and damage our relationships with our friends and family. Your daughter was wrong to even think about looking at them and doubly wrong for think it\u2019s at all ok to react to them. She\u2019s being a terrible no by invading her son\u2019s privacy and ruining a much needed therapy tool.", "Remind her of how keen she was to focus on \"moving forward\" after the death of his father. She should rally that forward thinking perspective and apply it to this far less significant situation.   \n\n\nShame on her for failing all of the children.   \n\n\nThank you for being there for your grandson. Your support means more than you can possibly know.", "Does she realize that when the youngest of the three turns 18 she isn't going to hear from any of them again?

It\u2019s only going to hurt them and help no one!", "My younger sister was heavily favored over me. My 8year old self vented my frustrations in what I thought was a safe medium. Like you I was also punished for it and I\u2019ve never been able to keep a journal. It doesn\u2019t make me feel better at all to put my thoughts outside my head anymore. My head is the only place that\u2019s private. I\u2019ve been to therapy it just didn\u2019t help in that regard. I feel you. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you.", "Why is she calling him?  It\u2019s clearly not to apologize so is she just looking to yell at him some more?", "Your daughter needs therapy for herself alone and with the family. What she did was a huge violation of your grandson\u2019s privacy. She sounds extremely selfish & needs to give the journal back immediately. You are NTA & neither is your grandson. Your daughter needs to learn she can\u2019t force her son to feel the way she wants him to."]}
