I was very disappointed in her and expressed this to her as well as my opinion that she is a terrible mother. She believes I am wrong to judge her so I want some perspective.\n\nMy daughter was married twice. Her first husband died when their children were 9, 5 and 4. She met her second husband 18 months later and remarried after a year of dating and created a blended family with his daughter who was 4 at the point of their marriage.\n\nMy oldest grandson was destroyed by his dad's death. He was in therapy from the point of his dad's death, something my husband and I had to pressure our daughter to seek because she was focused more on moving forward. But our grandson was hardly eating or sleeping and had difficulty in school. My daughter thanked me later for giving her the push. When my grandson started therapy he was asked to keep a diary to help him. It was something that took him several months to use more than once a month but he did grow to use it a lot. This diary was something for his eyes only. Not even the therapist read it. They just discussed anything he wished to.\n\nMy daughter had more children with her second husband and things were fine. When my grandson decided he wanted to attend college locally he asked if he could live with my husband and myself and we agreed. He moved in with us in mid June.\n\nAbout a month later I noticed something was going on but I had no idea what. My other two grandchildren from my daughter's first marriage told me that their mom and brother were fighting because their mom had stolen his therapy diary while they were visiting us and that she was angry about it's contents. She was also mad at them because they defended their brother.\n\nI spoke to my grandson who was both angry and sad. He told me his mom was never supposed to read those. I spoke to my daughter next. She ranted at me about how my grandson had written about her husband and other children, including her stepdaughter. She said he never wanted her to move on. That he had wanted her to be alone forever. That he didn't even love his much younger siblings, just the two from her marriage to his dad. She said she couldn't look at him. I asked her if it was true she stole the diary. She was stunned I would ask and told me I should be focused more on the contents, especially when some of it was written right before he moved in with me. I told her it was kept in a diary and never vocalized to any of them. She said that didn't matter and I said it did. She told me I should be on her side. That he should be shunned for writing so many awful things. This is when I expressed my disappointment in her and called her a terrible mother.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693238141, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163pugc/aita_for_calling_my_daughter_a_terrible_mother/", "score": 4256, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I asked her if she writes in a journal and she said she can't.

He needs someone on his side.", "And the worst part is he never treated any of the children poorly or even that differently. Subtle, very minor differences, yes.

I'm pretty sure i had some fairly awful thoughts about my parents/siblings during those years, often dependent upon whether or not I had to wash the dishes.

But you, attacking her years of motherhood to multiple children, is a blemish on your own motherhood, indeed.  You owe your daughter an apology for your overreaction, unless you believe she is a bad mother to all of her children.

She was stunned I would ask and told me I should be focused more on the contents, especially when some of it was written right before he moved in with me.\n\nAbsolutely not. The real issue is her stealing his diary and massively violating his trust and boundaries. \n\nIt doesn't matter what was written in it - that was for him alone to read and a good way to process his feelings. Many people keep diaries as it's very cathartic to see stuff written down instead of keeping it swirling in your head where it gets muddled and side tracked.\n\nThat your daughter can't even acknowledge what she did was wrong, makes her a massive AH.  \n\n\nYou are NTA for calling her out for this (although  you could have communicated it better maybe).", "Stealing the diary is the most disrespectful thing she could have done.  She invaded his privacy.  I won't be surprised if he never trusts his mother again.  She is a fool if she doesn't realize this.  She needs to own up to what she did, not turn it around on her son.

She didn\u2019t support him or give him time to heal before she replaced his father, expanding the family as if his original family never existed. She caused the rift between him and his youngest siblings. She\u2019s the reason he needed that journal in the first place, by not being a safe space for him to work through his grief. Now she has invaded his privacy and violated his most intimate private thoughts and feelings. And she is sharing all of this with his siblings, causing them pain as well. All of this is terrible parenting!! You are NTA! Your daughter needs some intense therapy of her own. Without it she is going to destroy her relationships with all of her children and you. When her first husband passed, she was grieving and didn\u2019t support her children as they needed. I don\u2019t assume there was any malice involved, and she probably thought her choices were what was best for the kids. The choices she is making now are intentional and malicious, towards all of her children, and her behaviour is emotional abuse.

Didn't your daughter ever learn that when you sneak and snoop, you'll only learn bad things about yourself?", "At some point when I was in college I found out that my mom had been going through my sister's stuff. I had a bunch of old notebooks in my closet. Mostly creative writing, but occaisonal venting/letters. I told my dad straight out that if my mom went through the notebooks that she wouldn't like what she'd read. I think she knew that without being told and probably didn't go through them.\n\nDid your daughter never have even a minute of thinking unkind things about her kids?

I obviously disagree with others. Of course she shouldn't have stolen the diary and her reaction to its contents is bad.

Think she missed that memo.", "NTA. Your daughter sounds like a piece of work. Also she either does not understand therapy, or ignores it so she can get angry. \nAlso, you never ever read a diary.", "If I\u2019m understanding you correctly, you called your daughter a terrible mother because she displayed an inability to understand that her son has the right to his own private thoughts and feelings (Basically his own personhood).  While this may be harsh, I think it\u2019s true.  You could have explained this to her in a more clear way instead of calling her names, but under the circumstances (in which your daughter seems very self-absorbed and unwilling to acknowledge that she\u2019s being disrespectful of her son\u2019s privacy and his right to have his own private feelings), maybe putting it as bluntly as you did was the right thing to do.\n\nYou are NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, the fact that she\u2019s so self-centered may make her a \u201cterrible mother.\u201d  The son\u2019s feelings are normal and understandable.  Kids are selfish and narcissistic, so you\u2019d expect the child to Interpret the mother\u2019s moving on only in relation to how that affects him and his feelings. But as you get older and mature into an adult, you learn that not everything is about you, and you develop empathy and the ability to consider things from someone else\u2019s perspective.  The mother\u2019s narcissistic and self-centered reaction to her son\u2019s private thoughts is very disappointing, because you\u2019d hope that the parent could read the child\u2019s diary and think about how the child is feeling, not be laser focused on their own feelings  about the content.  As a parent, you should set your own feelings aside and help the child develop emotionally and socially.

Even if your daughter has a right to redirect her life, her duty as a mother came first, especially if her son was suffering so horribly.\n\nPlus the act of rummagin among her son's belongins and reading the therapy diary. That's an enormous breach of trust and a big no-no.", "NTA!! Your daughter, however, may be AH of the month.   \nThank God that her son has you on his side. She breeched any and all trust that should exist between mother and son. The icing is that her concern is not about her son but what he said in his private writings. Totally self centered. It's so sad.", "NTA\n\nShe is a terrible mother.", "I'm going to go a bit against the grain and say (as a parent) I can understand wanting to read your kid's diary. But this is is why you never should! You experience their raw emotions from years ago in the present moment, and most people aren't able to compartmentalise and not let it influence their views of the person going forward. \nThat said, you're still NTA and reasonable to think your daughter is a bad parent because a) she still doesn't acknowledge it was her at fault b) hasn't returned the diary c) told her son she read it d) didn't deal with her emotions privately but took them out on her children and e) brought everyone else in the family into this shitshow. I can't understand why she can't see how this would negatively impact not just her relationship with her son but her other children (from first marriage, being asked to take sides, and from second marriage, being told their stepbrother thinks awful things about them when he probably no longer does and maybe never truly  did). And also straining the relationship between her son and his stepfather by introducing this. What absolute carnage and somehow she's blaming a teenager rather than taking responsibility for starting it all. She has to be the grown up in this situation! Obviously I can't imagine losing a spouse and becoming a single parent to three kids, and I'm glad she's found happiness with someone else. She just needs to own her behaviour and stop before she utterly ruins her family.\n\nEdit: I'm also wondering if this outburst is unresolved trauma/grief from your daughter. Her breezy \"moving on\" might well be denial and this journal has brought up lots of uncomfortable feelings that she might have felt herself and repressed. Now her anger at her son might be projecting from internalised anger at her own emotions around this, which she's been repressing. If so, it's very sad but doesn't make it not bad parenting. This is why it's so hard being a parent! You have to handle your own emotions and avoid damaging your kids with them.

Even made them believe that we wouldn't want them around or give them shelter so they kept away from us out of fear. Until they both hit 18.\n\nSo my guess is your daughter is likely trying to keep an illusion of a perfect family.

She should have told her son she never meant to hurt him and that she is so so sorry for not seeing that her children needed more time, and that she's sorry for putting her desires above her childrens need to grieve. She should be crying at his feet for making him suffer in silence and never picking up the signs. Instead - she's alienating him from the family and trying to force you to alienate him too. She is RADIATING bad mother energy. I'm so happy your other grandchildren are defending him. And God his half siblings must be going through it right now too, feeling like their existence is the problem because your daughter insisted everyone know, bad step mom energy too. You should send this post to your daughter so she can read the comments in shame for knowing that everybody thinks she's in the wrong here. NTA, your grandson is lucky to have you.", "Hope you got his diary back. She sounds very selfish.", "Maybe its time to change up your will so your daughters' share goes straight to your grandchildren instead when the day comes.\n\nI'd be petty and give some explanation for the move too, like 'to compensate for the suffering your failure as a parent caused him and to pay for the therapy he needed because his mother is pathetic.' ;)", "Yes! Which you fuckin proved by STEALING THE DIARY! OMG this enrages me \n\nSorry this happened to you", "She\u2019s clearly mad she read the truth. It sounds like she\u2019s pushing this perfect family narrative to pasiegos her own guilt for moving on so fast (possibly during her first marriage?) that\u2019s also why she doesn\u2019t want her kids in therapy she knows what she did was wrong - NTA", "Hard same.  I tried to keep a diary a number of times, but gave up pretty quickly.  Now I'm wondering whether I feared that something like this would happen, so I prevented myself from leaving any kind of 'evidence' of my feelings.", "This is incredibly cruel. I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you.", "I think you're right. For therapy to work you have to trust that whatever is said during those sessions won't be used against you. She's proven that she's incapable of that. I hope she's prepared for her three oldest to go NC as soon as they are out of the house", "I was a very angry teen. My mom once read my diary, in which I wrote about how out of place and unloved I felt, and I wondered if I was adopted. So my mom read the entry, immediately proceeded to confront me and slap me REALLY HARD because she was so mad about what I wrote.\n\nMy dad defended me and yelled at her for intruding my privacy though. I always had a very difficult relationship with my mom growing up, and that one incident broke our relationship for many years. I never trusted her until I moved out and thousands of miles away from home.\n\nMy dad and I have always been close, though.", "Also, like, given how his mother behaves and treats him and his needs it's no wonder his opinions are the way they are. He's willing to be civil and kind to them- which is far more than he's obligated to. He could just ignore them.", "Bc she is looking for another round of rant. How is she a victim and he- a villain. Bc in her mind it is all about her.", "and not returning it", "I kept diaries throughout my childhood, and it was a family rule that no one EVER read each others private writing. If anyone had betrayed that, it would have destroyed my ability to trust. I\u2019m so so sorry that happened to you.", "That\u2019s awful.  I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you.", "Yup been there. I was punished for saying things I didn\u2019t like to do the dishes and my mom would force me to do it a month or more by myself. I kept trying like 3 times to hide and lock it properly and yet she would find a way. I could never trust her at all with certain things and kept a lot to myself.", "Buy him a new one, maybe one with a lock.", "Your daughter should  be ashamed of herself. At this point she hurts anyone who will listen just to look like \" oh poor me\" mother. She is clearly attention seeker. \nA dealbreaker for moving forward is for her to a least give back the diary. But I doubt she will do it. Bc it will mean she looses her weapon against her own son.", "Over reaction? She's abusive. In the near future OP will have to decide because I guarantee that her three oldest grandkids will go NC with their mother as soon as they are all out of that house.", "Seriously?? She retraumatized her own child! What planet are you on?", "Geez that was my mother. Feeling your pain, Magpie. \ud83c\udf3b", "And probably telling her kids what their half-brother really feels about them", "Same. My dad did this to me when I was in grade school. My mom gifted me a locked diary. My dad found the key and complained at what I've written there. I was so mortified & angry at the transgression to the point I literally tore each of the pages in the diary, ripped them to shreds and threw it in the trash.\n\nI've never kept a diary or even a journal since. I've kept to myself and have never spoken to either of my parents about any of my private matters even as an adult but they complain that I keep secrets from them. *facepalm", "While I agree with the sentiment if the grandson doesn\u2019t want her to take it back then it\u2019s best for him specifically to respect his wishes and just support him as much as possible", "I would suggest she use a tactic other than force. I\u2019m sure she can be clever about it.", "NTA\n\nWhat your daughter did was abhorrent.  Her son will never, ever be able to trust her.  She's managed to destroy any relationship she had with him.\n\nYou're doing the right thing by sticking up for him and so are his sisters.  Your daughter is going the right way about destroying her relationship with them too if she keeps going on about this like she is.\n\nShe needs to do a lot of grovelling and even then he's probably not going to forgive her.. well he might but he doesn't have to forget what she did and he has every right to protect himself from her.\n\nThis is a delusion of hers... that she's remarried and has the perfect, cohesive new family with a new partner... well.. not she doesn't.  Your grandson's feelings were his and he showed great maturity in not acting out on them.", "NTA the only time I could see reading your child's diary as justifiable is if the child was actually missing and you were hoping to find a clue as to what might've happened. \n\nThat's IT. No other reason is okay. Children deserve privacy too and a journal is private by definition. Your daughter is absolutely a terrible mother for violating such a clear, private space.", "NTA in anyway shape or form.", "NTA. Keep fighting for your grandson like you're doing.", "NTA, truth hurts and you daughter has done a despicable thing so telling her she is a terrible Mother isn't wrong, she is, and by all accounts him wanting to come and live with you proves that", "I believe there's another term for terrible mothers that you might want to consider.  Here is is: Disinherited.  Completely, in favor of your poor grandson.  \n\nI also have some helpful ideas as to who in the family should be shunned, and it's not your grandson.\n\nNTA", "BTA. She is a terrible mother and I hope her son cuts her off for a long while. Poor kid don't deserve that.", "She is so wrong. Anything like the diary especially as therapy is off limits  he cannot trust her and what he wrote was how he feels and is outlet. She may of damaged their relationship forever.", "Nta, she broke his trust and she will never repair the damage.", "Nta\n\nShe's the asshole. \n\nMy mother did this to me growing up not once but twice. I've had to keep journals for anxiety therapy etc. But I always end up ripping the pages out after as I have anxiety about people reading how I feel about them. \n\nIt's more damaging than people think. \nPerhaps get him a little safe for Christmas so he can lock away his thoughts and has full control. Hope he recovers from this betrayal", "Does he still go to therapy ever. Maybe he should tell therapist about it. She is untrustworthy and he will not ever forget. Wonder what step-dad thinks about what she did.", "When I read the title, I was ready to come in swinging about how you were probably some out of touch boomer. How you were some evil matriarch who made everybody around you miserable.\n\nYeah, nah. NTA \n\nWhat your daughter did was beyond fucked up. Everybody is entitled to their private thoughts. Nobody deserves to have their (very legitimate) feelings invalidated because it doesn't sit with someone else's narrative. \n\nKeep being there for your grandson. Your daughter is being unbelievably self-centred.", "NTA, and show your daughter some of these comments. Therapy did nothing for her, obviously, and I wouldn't be surprised if nobody in her family ever trusted her again.", "This \ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5", "Same. My parents read every single diary I tried to keep as a teen and i got punished in different ways just for being a teenager. It gave me so much trauma that I have so much trouble writing down my own thoughts even though I\u2019m older now. \nI used to be an aspiring writer back then but since those incidents I\u2019ve never written anything and stayed away from that part of my life. Really sucks when parents break trust like that.", "Be there for your grandson and don't be too hard on yourself. I can't speak for how you raised your daughter and all the factors involved in her upbringing but remember that in the end the children you raise are their own people and probably had many influences outside your own during their youth and adolescence. \n\n\nShe's grown now and you may not be able to help her see her fault in this, but you can protect and support your grandson. Regardless of how \"mean\" his feelings may seem he tried his best to keep face and the diary was his outlet. He can't rely on his own mother for support but he has you and his siblings and hopefully that can help him recover.\n\nNTA"]}
