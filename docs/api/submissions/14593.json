Great that you kept your cool, but that doesn't make you better than her.\n\nAnd then your comment about her owing you?!?! So gross. If you threw it out there casually like that, I bet it's not the first time you objectified her like that, is it? And then you told him and he \"let it slide\"...who cares.

Now you're not just the ah, you're the creep everyone will avoid and talk about.", "YTA\n\nShe panicked, which is something people do in a high stress situation like watching their boyfriend collapse. It's not like she stood there unbothered and coldly watching him die, One of the things you learn in first aid training is that as bystander, you need to take control of the scene and issue clear orders because people close to the victim will usually panic and not be useful without explicate instructions.\n\n> Eri and I were in the hospital, and I was a little bit pissed at her for being so useless when we needed her the most.

She may know these things under normal circumstances, but being under pressure like that, when her boyfriend is literally having a heart attack, things are less clear and very traumatic. She just froze is what it sounds like.", "YTA", "YTA it can be very traumatizing to see your boyfriend go through something like that. So it makes sense that she would be scared and panic, even if she is CPR certified. Doing it in a real situation is very different from a practice situation. I understand that he\u2019s your lifelong friend but he\u2019s also her boyfriend so he\u2019s very important to both of you and instead of being upset with her you both need to be supportive to each other to recover from a scary situation.", "YTA. My father went into cardiac arrest in front of my children and me. While I didn\u2019t panic per se, it was shocking, horrifying and I completely forgot to pull him off his bed when I performed CPR. I was composed enough to call 911, yell for my kids to secure the dog and unlock the door for the EMTs, perform CPR until the EMTs arrived and took over, but 4 yrs later I\u2019m haunted that I forgot to pull him on the damn floor. He died in front of us. It is extremely horrifying to see someone you love go into cardiac arrest!! I still have trouble hearing sirens, seeing CPR scenes in movies/TV etc. Your choice to sexually harass this poor woman and shame her are just icing on your asshole cake smdh.", "YTA and worse things that would get my response removed if I typed them out", "YTA - people have unpredictable reactions to stressful situations. \n\nYou should have told her to administer CPR as you were calling emergency services. If she failed to do so, you should have attempted CPR yourself after calling emergency services. It is recommended that people take turns giving CPR while waiting for an ambulance anyway, because it's tiring to perform. \n\nNot doing exactly the right thing in an emergency situation doesn't make anyone a bad person though, it's difficult & incredibly stressful.\n\nThat said, there was absolutely no reason to sexually harass the GF afterwards.", "YTA \n\nAnd that\u2019s coming from someone who had a decade of emergency service response to my name. \n\nIf it was my loved one I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be so calm as I have been when I\u2019m in work mode. \n\nAnd to sexually harass her after? \n\nYou are filth.", "YTA.\n\nYou can prepare all you want, but until you experience an emergency situation, you do not know how you or others are going to react. \n\nFor example, I\u2019m very very calm in emergency situations - I have my breakdown later. My brother is totally useless, he shuts down. My dad cracks jokes and gets hysterical, my mother freaks out and gets borderline violent, and my former boyfriend was good in any emergency situation that does not involve blood, broken bones, or dislocated joints, but he dealt with it while crying. \n\nYou do not get to berate her for a reaction. If you are calm in these kinds of emergency situations, get yourself certified. You can not rely on others.\nBe self-reliant.", "YTA - not the time or the place. She\u2019s not a medical professional, of course she lost it seeing her boyfriend collapse and almost die in front of her. \n\nAnd then to top it off you try to hit on her at the bedside of her sick boyfriend. That\u2019s really sick.", "YTA , anyone can learn CPR I took a 30min course last summer, but not everyone can perform under conditions like that, it\u2019s best she didn\u2019t do it if she wasn\u2019t in the right state of mind, if you don\u2019t do it properly complications will come up. Being in SHOCK is real.", "YTA and a massive one.  First of all, people freeze sometimes. It happens. And then coming on to her while he is in the hospital...... I would have banned you out of my life.", "YTA. People react differently to emergency and shock. Kudos for to you for cool head and quick reaction.

It's a very big reason that it is majorly frowned upon for family or close friends to medically treat one another. And your lingerie picture request/joke is extremely inappropriate.", "YTA. People sometimes panic when the situation involves someone they are close to. It's an AH move to shame someone about it. You compounded the AH move with the idiot request for lingerie shots, \"joking\" or not. You owe her an apology.", "YTA. Not everyone is prepared for something like that, your first instinct when someone is in an medical emergency is to call 911. You berated your friend for her lack of action and then sexually harassed her afterwards for what was something completely out of her control. Was she a doctor? Was she a nurse? Was she any kind of medical personnel that was capable of reacting to that situation right away? No, she wasn't. She needs to lose your number.", "Yta, you know there\u2019s a reason why medical professionals aren\u2019t allowed to work on their loved ones.

Have some fucking empathy, man. Also, the lingerie comment is gross and creepy.", "It's easy to assume how one would handle a situation until one is put in that situation. While she knew CPR, in that moment she froze. Knowing and doing are two different entities. You shouldn't hold anything against her as she herself is probably beating herself up about not taking action. It's fight or flight response that kicks in and welp she froze.\n\nYou are a bit pissed she froze up. Now you know her flight/freeze response may be stronger than her fight response. Take this as an initiative to learn CPR. There's no harm in knowing CPR.", "Came in here for the title thinking this would be a solid nta, but wow that took two left turns in the other direction straight to YTA. \n\nHave you not been trained in how to talk to other people or people of the opposite sex? Did you freeze and forget that in the moment?", "YTA! Your behaviour was all round terrible but the most fucked up part was the lingerie comment. Also you do realise the first step of first aid is to call emergency services! It's literally the first thing you're supposed to do before even administering CPR! Secondly, you judged his girlfriend for panicking in such a situation which was harsh as fuck. I'm pretty sure emergency services will talk you through administering CPR even if you're untrained.", "YTA. That's disgusting. She froze. You showed your true pervert colors.", "YTA. Massively. And a creep. Your friend is also a bit of a creep for letting your creepy behaviour go. Her boyfriend went into cardiac arrest. It happens.

Also being told he needs to feel grateful to OP for doing the minimum to save his life. Give him time to think.", "That \"rule\" just isn't relevant to the post but oh, well. It's not like someone asked her to do surgery on her bf!", "Of course it's relevant. The \"rule\" exists for the same reason. People's reaction to a loved one in dire circumstances is unpredictable. Not just in surgery - in ALL dire circumstances. And that's why, when we have the opportunity to plan things, like with surgery, we avoid putting people in charge of handling their loved ones' emergencies."]}
