I think it's common sense to let someone know the conversation isn't private even if nothing private is being spoken about. But at the very least, the second you spoke about some private or vulnerable things, your friend should've interrupted and let you know the conversation wasn't just the two of you. It can be quite a big breach to feel like someone isn't giving you the privacy you deserve when you confide in someone or are just discussing sensitive topics and stuff.", "NTA you were right he should\u2019ve given you the heads up that the conversation wasn\u2019t private.", "NTA. \n\nNot sure how old you both are, but it's a good thing he's learning this lesson with you and not in another situation! Privacy and trust are pretty important and it's in his best interest to give you the full story so you can feel comfortable enough to share those private thoughts that not everyone gets to hear, which will only continue to strengthen your friendship.\n\nHe may have been showing off or something in front of his new gf to make her laugh or to seem cool. Annoying, but not surprising if she hasn't been around long.", "NTA\n\nYou're right: you can have ton of reasons why you don't want to be heard by someone else when talking with someone on the phone.", "NTA. It's a pretty jerk move to be on speaker and not tell the person you're talking to that there are other people around.", "NTA. If you want to be generous, you can assess the damage and decide if you want to dial it back with your friend. You acknowledge social awareness is not a strong point for him and this was likely a learning point. You can hammer it home for him be asking \"am I on speaker? Who all am I talking to?\" For the next year or  so, or at least before you talk just between the two of you.", "I\u2019m not sure I understand the question. You can\u2019t be an asshole just for _being_ pissed. If you explained the etiquette calmly, that\u2019s fine. If you were rude and dickish about it, that\u2019s not. Your emotions don\u2019t matter; your actions do.", "NTA, you always say \u201cyou\u2019re on speaker with blah blah\u201d", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would have, if I was in that car. You thought you were talking to your friend in a safe place, he made it unsafe (whether on purpose or not).

It should be clear to your friend that he shouldn't let someone else in on the conversation without telling you, especially since y'all were discussing sensitive topics.  I'd call the friend more naive? negligent? than AH-ish, but you're not wrong to be annoyed.", "NTA it is common sense to not do that. Your feelings are valid. I mean if you're telling him something person like that then obviously it might warrant  some angry reaction. \n\nI'd just never tell him anything unless it's in person at this point", "NTA. I ALWAYS announce you're on speaker if they are lol.", "NTA. You are right.

While what your friend did isn't good etiquette, it needs more than that to reach AH level IMHO.  There needs to be a refusal to solve the problem in a reasonable way -- in this case, by apologizing.  You don't metion whether he apologized or even if you asked him to so it's impossible for me to give any ruling other than NAH based on available info.\n\nMaking a mistake is not an AH move.", "NAH.
