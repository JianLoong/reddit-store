We've had our ups and downs as all friendships have but we always make up in the end. Well when she announced that she was getting married she asked me to be one of her bridesmaids and I of course said yes because we're good friends and I wanted to support her. We went out to go dress shopping for her wedding dress and the bridesmaids wedding dresses. We eventually found some nice dresses for the bridesmaids. They were pink dresses that looked stunning and mine was modest enough that I felt comfortable with it. \n\nNow jump to the day of the wedding we all show up as soon as the bride sees me though she pulls me off to the side and asked why I decided to wear my red hijab to the wedding as you're not supposed to wear red at weddings. I told her that this was the closest  hijab that I had that would match with the dress as I'm not going to wear a black hijab or a white one as you aren't supposed to wear white at a wedding either. She told me that she would have preferred me wear a black hijab than red even though the red matched better. She then told me that I should have just bought a pink one to match with the dress. Now I have to say that I'm not necessarily a fan of pink but I was wearing it for the wedding because I'd do it for a friend but I wasnt going to spendoney on a new hijab that I'd probably only wear once and then have it sit around. I told Clara this but she was still insistent that I should have bought a pink one or worn a black hijab instead. She said I didn't ruin her special day but she was cold to me for the rest of the wedding and reception because of it. So I'm just curious AITA for wearing my red hijab instead of wearing a black one or buying a pink one?\n\nEdit: So I had worn the red hijab while dress shopping and I had made several comments about dresses matching the color of the hijab and some of the other bridesmaids agreed along with the bride herself but I didn't explicitly state I was going to wear it. Also apologies for not putting red as I messed up, I did not intend to try and be misleading.\n Edit 2: The red wasn't fire engine red it was a light coral, so on the lower end of the red spectrum but still red. The bride wasn't mad that the colors \"clashed\" she was mad about the apparent rule of if you wear red it means you slept with the groom, which I had no idea existed.", "created_utc": 1686068224, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/142l3ue/aita_for_wearing_my_hijab_to_a_wedding/", "score": 137, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your friend isn't mad that you wore a hijab. She is mad that you picked one that clashed with the dress and wasn't part of the wedding colors. She obviously knew you would wear one.

She is simply asking you to match. I just looked up pink hijabs on Amazon and they are at most 20 bucks and they look nice. Plus how do you know it will just sit around unused? It may grow on you and you may want to buy something to go with it. Idk if u had to help pay for anything in the wedding, but jeez u made it sound like buying a pink hijab was really expensive. If this was about wearing a hijab period I wouldn\u2019t blame you for dying that hill, but her preferring you matched the dress with your hijab to avoid the tradition of not wearing red at a wedding is a bit much on your part.", "I don't necessarily think you are T.

Shoes, jewelry, hairstyle, flowers, whatever is going to be in the pictures she has of her wedding, she should get a chance to give feedback. It would not have been difficult to try on the dress with the three different options and ask her what she preferred although if it was me, I would have asked you to buy a hijab that matches the dress in the first place.

You could have done a good champagne color or something complementary with pink.", "YTA and maybe you could have looked into I don't know some fabric that matches the tone of the dress, and put it over the hijab (I hope this is not insensitive, I'm not that deep into it, if this would have been allowed or not) because then you only pay a small amount aginst the cost of a new hijab that you only wear once, you get a piece of fabric wich you can later use as I don't know, stuffing if you decide to make a pillow, as a decorativ piece for a table you dont look at, or stuff.", "Definitely NTA, its better than wearing a white hijab to the wedding also am I the only one that sees that she wore the same hijab to the dress fittings so they could probably infer that is what she'd wear?", "YTA. Never surprise a bride with a clothing choice on the day of a wedding. Buying one-time-use clothing falls under the definition of being a bridesmaid. Some people put a lot of effort in to their wedding colors.

It\u2019s ridiculous!  You did well. Do t worry about it. It will soon pass.", "NTA. You had no idea about the red thing, plus not everyone knows that. I didn't even know it until recently and I'm 61! Plenty of ladies attended my wedding 38 years ago wearing red! Also, the hijab was more coral, as you said.

You are NTA for wearing your hijab to a wedding, you are TA because you couldn\u2019t even be bothered to find a special garment for your friend\u2019s special day that matches the dress tone.

Never mind a good friends wedding. \nAlso, Clara telling you red is a no no at weddings, I know this is a thing in certain cultures but you have not mentioned hers. This could also be borderline AH territory for you OP. \nThe bride should have DEFINITELY brought you shopping (purchase it) for a co-ord hijab for the dress if she wanted a certain colour. \nSo I\u2019m going to go ESH. But definitely more you so far, without more info.", ">Edit 2: The red wasn't fire engine red it was a light coral, so on the lower end of the red spectrum but still red.\n\nBy this definition, pink is also red.

Which is pretty common in weddings where people have way too much on their mind, way too much stress and some dream idea of a perfect wedding.   \n\nYes, you could have done it better if you'd thought explicitly to ask, but as you said you wore it to the dress fitting.  Yes, your friend could have asked explicitly what colour she wanted you to wear, but she probably had 1000 things on her mind with the wedding planning.   Yes, your friend was cold to you on the day, because weddings have heightened emotions everywhere.    I don't think that makes any of you AH though.   An AH would only appear if someone holds a grudge over this and lets it spoil a long term friendship.", "YTA, you should have told Clara right when you were dress shopping about wearing the red hijab. I get not wanting to buy a hijab just for a wedding, but you have to be understanding that it\u2019s also a lot of fabric so of course it was gonna stand out and ruin Clara\u2019s color scheme. Now all her pics have red in it. You were also a bridesmaid, you can\u2019t just decide on whatever without telling the bride. Red is too much and brings to much attention on a day all the attention should be on the bride. I\u2019d recommend you just go ahead and get a neutral tone hijab for these situations", "In North America, wearing red to a wedding (unless you're in the wedding party and the couple chose that color) can be a faux pas to traditional people. \n\nIt can hint at a previous sexual relationship with the bride or groom/is considered a showy color that upstages the wedding party. \n\nI'm not saying that this custom makes sense or that everyone follows it, but this might be why the bride was upset.

The only real rule, don\u2019t wear white or a color very close to white such that you look like you are in a wedding dress unless the bride gives the OK.", "How much does a hijab cost?", "NTA.

You are right about you buying one color just to never use it again which is a waste of money honestly.", "Omg NTA. she should\u2019ve brought the colour of your hijab up when you guys were picking out the dresses if she felt this strongly about it. \n\nAlso if the bride picks the outfits.. she should\u2019ve bought you a hijab in another colour.", "YTA hijab are not expensive and you should have bought a pink one like the bride suggested. \n\nRed is a color that people wear to bring attention to themselves", "There is no automatic rule against wearing red at weddings. There are a few subcultures in the US that have some oddities about it, but it's not at all in the same ballpark as wearing a white dress.\n\nAnd if you were a guest, I wouldn't say a thing about it. But as a bridesmaid, you really should have discussed your options with her prior to the wedding, rather than just assuming. You had no obligation to buy a new hijab, but it would have been better if you had allowed her to pick her preference from the available options.\n\nThat being said, NTA. Even though it would have been preferable to consult her, a hijab is part of your personal appearance, more similar to a hair length than an article of clothing. The same way it's inappropriate for brides to take issue with their bridesmaids hair length, she shouldn't have complained about it, especially since it was too late to do anything about it.", "No, NTA - If she has known you for that long and had any inkling of Islam and your adherence to your faith she would have known about the very good possibility you might wear one to her wedding.", "Should have brought the black one as well.", "Soft ESH you don't wear red at weddings. \n\nYou should have got a matching hijab.

This is common wedding knowledge, so it should have been brought up by one of you.  It\u2019s the same idea as if a bride wants everyone to use a certain hair piece or have a certain hairstyle. It\u2019s HER day; she gets to decide what the bridal party looks like. Had she asked you not to wear one, then you might have a case, but she didn\u2019t do that. \n\nThe bride is the AH because she obviously knows you wear a hijab, and again, this is something that should have been put into consideration with your individual dress. She can\u2019t ask you not to wear one, but she CAN ask you to wear a specific color.", "YTA, this didn't go the way I thought it would go.

Yes, there are more rules than you're used to, but you agreed to be a bridesmaid.", "YTA - OP, wearing Red to a wedding means you've had sexual relations with the bride or groom.
