You should be eligible for supported accommodation too.  Another option is to contact your local Citizens Advice Bureau.\n\nI don't know if \u00a3400pcm is above or below what would be an average figure for private rent in your region, though.  If you live in southeast England, that's almost certainly below market rate.

I think you are entitled to know what this \u00a3400pcm is covering, since it certainly isn't for any mortgage payments.

It\u2019s hard enough to get that payment at all, my mother still helps me with my rent so my PIP is all mine to make sure I can eat and be warm. \n\nMaybe you could take on paying for the food you eat? So it\u2019s no longer a household bill. The mortgage is paid so rent would be something she wants rather than requires to keep a roof over your heads. But the bills could be negotiated?

For example, if you only bring in 1/4 of the household income and your mum brings in 3/4, then you split bills that way. \n\nIn regards to your brother, I can see how that's frustrating when he's living there part time and I think that's a fair point to raise that he still lives in the household for part of the week and should be contributing proportionally to that.", "That sucks.

I do know that if she gets the Carer's Allowance that there are other things she may apply for. One of those is the UC, and you would stop receiving it if it were sent to her. \n\nIf she qualifies for the Carer's Allowance and isn't receiving it, perhaps she could get that and reduce the amount she's asking from you out of the UC/PIP.\n\nNot enough information for me to know if either of you are an asshole in this situation. \n\nIf she's using the UC and asking for your entire PIP, that doesn't seem reasonable.", "What do you mean penniless?\n\nOP receives PIP and Universal Credit (sometimes more than PIP but at minimum \u00a3100).  They are paying her from PIP instead of Universal Credit which **is** for living costs so they have their UC money left after \u201crent\u201d which includes bills and groceries.  \u00a3400 for bills and groceries especially since it\u2019s difficult for OP to make their own food and they can\u2019t work meaning they are likely to be home and have higher than average electric/heating bills is likely leaving OP better off than moving out even if OP were able to live alone.", "Your mom is counting on you not fighting anymore. You're being financially abused. In the US we have Adult Protective Services to call in these instances. Do you have a similar system in the UK?", "It is.\n\nNot only do disabled people have meager support financially, many have to jump through ridiculous hoops to get what they are entitled to. \n\nThe \u201cwork capability assessments\u201d often involve being assessed by somebody with no formal medical qualifications.  In many cases, claimants will be turned down, only getting their full entitlement on appeal \u2013 this process is far more expensive to the taxpayer than it would be without means testing.\n\nThere have even been thousands of cases where people have died from destitution because of erroneously being declared \u201cfit to work\u201d by this draconian regime.", "I need to clarify: I'm talking about the brother here. The argument that he doesn't need to pay rent because he's only there a couple days a week. If he were renting elsewhere he would need to pay rent regardless of how much time he spent at his girlfriends.\n\n  \nI'm not up on what disability pays in the UK. I believe he stated elsewhere that he'd have to leave home to get help with rent and taxes. Is he not well-informed?", "Wtf. I literally only needed to fill out a few forms, get a letter from a MEDICAL professional and a quick interview where I got back pay and normal pay the next day. The only hassle I've had is public housing taking 2 years to get me a house while on priority waiting list but that was during the hight of covid and wait times went up. I'm sure my experience was pretty easy compared to other people in my country but there's still so much more support that what it seems England has. I hope that system is fixed soon, no one should be destitute over circumstances they can't control.", "Sorry thanks for clarifying. \n\n<he'd have to leave home to get help with rent and taxes>\n\nThats correct but if he's getting PIP as a household they benefit from other help the govts currently providing on utilities. \n\nThe UK benefit system is a mess and its complicated to use the system so not everyone is aware of what support is available unfortunately.", "[Here's a case in point about how the Department for Work & Pensions has blood on its hands.](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/04/dwp-apologise-for-telling-seriously-ill-man-to-find-a-job)", "Holy fucking shit that's evil. At that point change up the system entirely and leave it up to MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS to determine if they are eligible."]}
