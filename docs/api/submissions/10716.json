You'll get extra money for housing benefit and would get some priority for council housing due to disability. It's a very long process to get on the council housing list though.", "Definitely NTA - but maybe she can apply for a carers allowance.

You could try using her landlord logic against her as an argument to get your brother to contribute. If he lived anywhere else he would still have to pay, regardless of how many nights he actually stays there.

It's even worse for anybody under the age of 35 because, for whatever reason, you're only entitled to the \u2018shared accommodation rate\u2019 of the local housing allowance (LHA) portion of UC (albeit this likely doesn't apply to you in this instance).\n\nThe best thing I can recommend is getting yourself on the council housing register, if at all you believe this is a plausible option.  You should be eligible for supported accommodation too.  Another option is to contact your local Citizens Advice Bureau.\n\nI don't know if \u00a3400pcm is above or below what would be an average figure for private rent in your region, though.  If you live in southeast England, that's almost certainly below market rate.  Whether that is better for you compared to if you did get the LHA element of UC, I cannot answer.\n\nThe most concerning aspect of this is determining whether you're being subjected to financial abuse.  I think you are entitled to know what this \u00a3400pcm is covering, since it certainly isn't for any mortgage payments.  I hope that this isn't a case of your mum using your disability benefits to cover the lion's share of bills, or paying for groceries whilst she spends little or none of her earnings (assuming she is working) for the same.", "NTA, because I know how ridiculous it is to prove you need PIP in the first place and it\u2019s for you to help yourself, it\u2019s a personal \u201cindependence\u201d payment. It\u2019s supposed to help you be independent through your disability so it pays for things you require to ease your suffering. My UC pays some of my rent, and I get contribution based ESA, which is used to top it off essentially. But that\u2019s not necessarily what it\u2019s for. \n\nAt the moment, we are experiencing a huge cost of living issue to the point where people can\u2019t eat or heat their homes. I feel that you could offer to pay into bills that you use, but 400pcm seems steep when that\u2019s your entire PIP payment. It\u2019s hard enough to get that payment at all, my mother still helps me with my rent so my PIP is all mine to make sure I can eat and be warm. \n\nMaybe you could take on paying for the food you eat? So it\u2019s no longer a household bill. The mortgage is paid so rent would be something she wants rather than requires to keep a roof over your heads. But the bills could be negotiated? I just don\u2019t think you should be paying ALL of your payment to her, that doesn\u2019t help you be independent.", "NTA and she\u2019s abusing you financially. Your PiP is for supporting you, not for rent! If you went into local authority housing then you\u2019d get benefits to cover part or all of your rent. Speak to your advisor at the centre and ask about support for people who are being taken advantage of financially. Explain that your mother is taking your entire PIP and it\u2019s leaving you out of pocket and penniless with no way to escape. If you won\u2019t see the centre for a bit then call Citizens Advice or MIND to get support.", "Youre only giving her 400?  How much would she be able to rent your room out for?  Probably 600 at the least.\n\nYou also are getting her physical assistance and I bet she is also providing food.  \n\nShe also has to pay insurance on her property and property taxes.\n\nYour money doesn't even allow her to pay her insurance and electric bill.

It definitely costs more for me to live with her (eg, the heating and electricity (about \u00a3300pm) would probably be less if it was just her and she pays for most of the groceries) but I don\u2019t see how that adds up to more than \u00a3400 like she claims. \n\nMy brother doesn\u2019t contribute because he doesn\u2019t live with us full time - he\u2019ll usually be here for a few days a week and then go to his girlfriend\u2019s place.", " Hope if OP needs one they get them pop up as much as I did...!!!", "There\u2019s no chance of my brother paying anything.

Everything else, yes, but if I moved out I would receive housing benefit to help with rent (I\u2019m not eligible for it now as it doesn\u2019t cover living with family members)", "Then sit down with her and tell her you want to build a budget around your PIP that is reasonable so that you can save and have *some* spending money. Because let's be real, even though you can't live independently doesn't mean you're going to want or be able to live with your Mum forever. \n\nI would suggest you start by looking at the average costs for things and try splitting them down the middle. See what it all adds up to and go from there. Maybe you need to talk to your mum about proportional divisions of cost. For example, if you only bring in 1/4 of the household income and your mum brings in 3/4, then you split bills that way. \n\nIn regards to your brother, I can see how that's frustrating when he's living there part time and I think that's a fair point to raise that he still lives in the household for part of the week and should be contributing proportionally to that.", "That sucks. Could still use it as a reason to pay less with your mum though. It would then be up to her to tackle the issue with him.", "That is very true!

Given that the brother is only there 50% of the time I don't think they would find they get much of a reduction in rent even if their mother decided to ask him for a contribution too, and if he decided to move in with his girlfriend instead then OP would be right back to where their are at the moment.", "Except council tax looks at the household.
