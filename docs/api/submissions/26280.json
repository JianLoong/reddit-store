Prior to this he was engaged to his ex girlfriend, but they broke up due to incompatibility in the bedroom. However, they had met in middle school and were best friends prior to them dating. So they were best friends for at least 8 or 9 years before they started dating, and then they dated for 8 years (and were engaged) before parting ways amicably. He expressed to me when we first started dating that it was important to him that they maintain their friendship as she was his closest friend. I\u2019ve never seen him make any sort of sexual advances towards her nor have I gotten any indication from either of them that there is any romantic interest remaining - it seems purely, truly platonic. I\u2019ve never met her but I know they text and stuff and he\u2019ll sometimes go over and help her fix stuff if she needs help. If it helps they both grew up in a poor neighborhood and were really each other\u2019s source of support throughout the years emotionally. He often says he doesn\u2019t know where he\u2019d be without her. \n\nSo the scenario in question- it was her birthday a few weeks ago and she invited both of us to her birthday dinner. I\u2019ve never met her and I knew a bunch of people they knew in high school were going to be there and I wasn\u2019t going to know anyone so to be honest I said I didn\u2019t want to go and said he could go. Up until the day of the dinner I kept telling him it was ok when he asked. He even asked in the morning when she messaged him to confirm. However as the time got closer I started to get a horrible feeling and began getting nauseous and dizzy. I felt sick to my stomach and I told him I wanted him to stay home with me because I was sick. By the time he told her it was only about 30 minutes until the dinner started and she was absolutely livid. She told him she was disappointed that he told her so late because she was already at the venue and started crying because he had never missed a birthday of hers since they met 18 years ago. Eventually she got over it and forgave him and said she understood that I was his priority but she thinks I\u2019m wrong for what I did.  I think as his wife it doesn\u2019t matter when I start to feel uncomfortable, he shouldn\u2019t be going to an event for his ex when I\u2019m sick.\nTheir friendship is really hard to navigate so I don\u2019t know, AITA? She sure seems to think so but isn\u2019t holding a grudge, it\u2019s more of a \u201chaha ur wife is a bitch\u201d type thing is what I\u2019m gathering.", "created_utc": 1693954625, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16b36a4/aita_for_making_my_husband_miss_his_ex_fianc\u00e9es/", "score": 146, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why have the 3 of you never gone to dinner?\n\nETA, based on all your comments here, YTA for sure.", "YTA you said it was fine for days up until literal minutes before hand and just so happened to get sick? That's called anxiety and jealousy, something you should probably work on", "YTA... Unless you felt like you might need to go to a hospital or something, you're a grown lady and can take care of yourself if you're just coming down with a flu for one night.", "If she's a dealbreaker for him, why didn't you meet her BEFORE the wedding? This seems suspect. YTA.", "YTA. How long have you known your husband?  Were you not aware of the annual birthday party before?  You said you've never seen anything sexual between them.  If you've never met her, how would you know that?

The pretend sickness was a show of OP's true colours.\n\nGet a therapist OP and stop lying to your husband about you being a kind and accepting person of his past. He's going to see your true colours, so work on yourself and see if you can be a better wife, or just leave him and let him be happy and stop wasting both of your time. \n\nOF course YTA.

Sounds like manipulation.", "Yeah, kinda YTA. He\u2019s gone over to help her fix stuff but a day with a crowd you get anxiety? And you said you felt it was truly platonic and just friends.

It would sound like accusative, manipulative, and isolating. Why are you trying to do that to him?", "Wow, YTA. Inventing illness or exaggerating things that you used to stay home by yourself with when you were single  perhaps all that bedroom incompatibility will be reconsidered-  can he want to have sex with an immature partner? Seems icky.", "YTA. \n\nDo you seriously expect him to lose an 18 year friendship for someone he's known for 2 years? Get over yourself.\n\nMy boyfriend is still friends with his ex's and I'm friends with mine. It's been 11 years and neither of us have had an issue with the others friendship's with people who have seen us naked. \n\nPeople break up for a reason and can maintain a friendship especially if they had one for years before the relationship. \nIt is possible for ex's to be friends and you have no right to Challenge that because he's legally bound to you. \nIf you keep pushing him and playing games to make him choose, there are lawyers that can help him unbind himself to you. \n\nIs it just this female friend that you are trying to push out of his life or are you jealous of all his female friends? \n\nEither way you sick and hubby deserves better. \n\nYTA again", "YTA. You\u2019re toxic and insecure in your relationship. Marrying didn\u2019t fix this. You literally made yourself sick with jealousy.", "Well I mean. She isnt wrong about that last statement...\nYTA", "YTA. Clear as day that you downplayed your jealousy until it was time for your husband to leave. He gave ample time for you to give the okay to make sure you did not feel any type of way. Even after this, you expected no consequence for testing him this way. So far, it has not been written that you will do any actionable things to seek forgiveness. You just do not feel at fault.", "YTA. He was clear with you when you first started dating that she was an important part of his life. So YTA simply based on the fact that you live near each other but haven\u2019t even met her yet according to your comments. And that you hope they\u2019ll stop being friends the longer he\u2019s with you. If you couldn\u2019t respect his feelings about his oldest friend, ex or not, then you shouldn\u2019t have continued dating, let alone *married* him.", "YTA - You 100% made yourself sick to ruin it for him. May have been subconsciously, but still, you were sick not because of any illness, only to keep him from going. Very insecure.", "YTA\u2026 why would you make him cancel last minute? Its not like he was going to be able to make you feel better.", "Major YTA\n\nHoney, it doesn\u2019t sound like you were sick, it sounds like you were trying to control him by getting \u201cstomach pains\u201d and made him cancel 30 minutes before the party to piss his friend off. Your comments just reinforce the fact that you\u2019re super jealous of your husband\u2019s friend and you\u2019re trying to ruin his friendship with her. How ridiculous! You knew when you married him that she was his friend and former fianc\u00e9, you can\u2019t go back now and say you don\u2019t like the friendship. If you didn\u2019t like it, you shouldn\u2019t have married him. You need help.", "YTA and I\u2019m also confused as to how you\u2019re married to this man but never met his closest friend? Weird.", "YTA!!!!! you are so insecure it is pathetic!", "Either you trust him or you don't.  You're insecurity shows you might have a lack of faith in him.  YTAH here.", "When narcissists manipulate\u2026.", "YTA- You chose such a poor way to show your insecurities. Maybe next time, be honest with him. Although the outcome truly exposed her as a self-absorbed person.", "Yta, I don't think she was even sick.", "YTA. So you conveniently happened to get sick just 30 minutes before the party and it was SO bad you bullied hubby into staying with you? Do you honestly think anybody believes this fabrication of yours?\nWhy aren\u2019t you just meeting the best friend instead of playing the diva? Your move was also super short-sighted; are you just gonna be coincidentally sick every single time he\u2019s about to hang out with her from now on? How do you envision this going forward? Do you think hubby\u2019ll still buy it after you re-enacted the same thing 5 times or so?\nJust meet the bff and get over yourself!! This extreme jealousy doesn\u2019t look good on you. Are you an actual adult or a teenager that can\u2019t be reasoned with whatsoever?", "YTA, you weren't drying. You had an anxious reaction and instead of dealing with it like an adult you manipulatated your husband. Just meet her for crying out loud.", "YTA \nKeep it up much longer and you won\u2019t have a husband to worry about.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's awesome. \n\nI do think the illness was probably psychosomatic but it doesn't sound like this is a pattern. It would definitely be something to work on in the future so it doesn't interrupt things again. \n\nWhat I can't get over is the ex fianc\u00e9's reaction. That does not read no romantic interest to me. It's not like she and him were the only ones going out together. Other people were invited. \n\nI have invited exes to events before and been bummed when they had to bail, whether for their current partners or not but I like...got that I was no longer the priority and enjoyed the people who came out. \n\nThis reads to me like he's still a primary attachment figure if she's that upset he missed a birthday. People are here saying you're childish for feeling sick and asking your husband to stay with you. What about the grown woman pitching a fit her ex couldn't make it to her birthday party? That's like parent-child shit. Friends with partners have to bail for them sometimes, it happens. \n\nAnd that's dicey to have another woman that emotionally dependent on you when you're married. There's close and then there's like properly dependent and this sounds more like the latter. \n\nI don't know what the right answer is here really but there probably needs to be some better expectations and boundaries set by they husband cause something is weird here.", "Maybe NTA.

(And, will absolutely be true if you keep doing self-sabotaging shit like getting \"sick\" - you shit-tested him this time, but that will not play for long.)\n\nBut you also must understand they are post-romantic, that she could be a tremendous ally for you both, and that a friendship with her could \\*\\*literally\\*\\* help you build an incredible foundation for your marriage and future family, right????", "\"But even if I was anxious he should have stayed home. \"\n\nNope.

We all agree (separately) that we were completely incompatible as couples, but are still really close.", "lol your biggest mistake is marrying someone thinking theyd change for you. he had done nothing wrong and people can truly be friends after relationships end.  stop being so insecure.\n\nand what would you do if they had a kid? cos she would always be part of his life by default", "You're a grown woman (supposedly), why are you crying to Mommy over your foolish and jealous behavior (and you know that it is, don't try to deny it).", "Lmao. I'm best friends with my childhood ex too. He's married, and so am I. We've known each other for 21 yrs. I'm the god mother of his child, and also best friends with his wife. Grow the fuck up.

No further comment on she had to go to a dr or any comment on the \u201cIllness\u201d. Nah she had some anxiety and threw out a line of bullshit. Worst case, \u201chey honey you go have a good time I\u2019ll be fine here in bed\u201d this is pure mental gaming. Of course lotsa women are gonna rush to defend her and that\u2019s cool.

I think she needs to meet this girl face to face without her husband there and sincerely apologize for what happened. Something like \u201con the day of your birthday dinner I got super anxious about husband going and being around you because of your history together. I worked myself up into a panic attack that I mistook for getting sick and made him stay home.

I'm just saying that I understand your discomfort with this relationship, but you're at a turning point.  Your approach is to stick your head in the sand, and it's actually causing you physical pain.  So that's not great.  Meet her.  She might suck, she might be great, you might feel better or worse in watching their dynamic, but you'll know for sure.\n\nAnd he married you - that must count for something.

You shouldn\u2019t marry someone unless the current situation is one you\u2019re willing to cement.
