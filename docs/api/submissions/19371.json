At some point you\u2019ll have to decide if your relationship with them and the money you\u2019re saving is worth the abuse you take from him and the effort his demands place on you.  At the very least, it\u2019s worth paying a lawyer for a couple hours of their time to tell you what your legal responsibility is and what entangling yourself from your dad on the lease would look like.   Best of luck.", "Kick him out.

How are you selfish? You feed him, you house him. Why are you doing this to yourself? Kick him out.", "Info: are you paying the mortgage? Does he contribute at all to mortgage payments?  \n\nEven if your parents gifted you a significant down payment, there\u2019s still monthly payments, so I\u2019m curious how he contributes. Does he help buy groceries? Pay internet/cable?", "NTA. I kicked my younger brother (early-30s) out of my house for being an ungrateful snot, you should do the same if yours decides to be a jerk. \n\nHe can easily have his lunch portion for dinner if he wants it, but he is not entitled to the portion that you planned to have for your own lunch.", "But here\u2019s the thing\u2026 what are they going to do if you kick him out?\n\nThey are being toxic either way but this way you have to put up with their shit AND your brothers. \n\nKick him out.", "NTA\n\n1) Contact a property/landlord-tenant lawyer to interpret local property laws and determine your portion of the property. It's best to be informed in case you need to take action.\n\n\n2) You may be able to employ the same lawyer to draft and send a warning letter to your brother, copying your parents, in which you describe his verbal and financial abuse, and his anger issues.

Give him one month to shape up, and then he's out.\nI say to employ the property lawyer for 2   because he may be able to use instruments (forms, words, rules) based on landlord-tenant law.\n\n3) You also need advice about how to protect yourself from further and escalating abuse.\n\nPlease take care of yourself!", "Kick him out", "NTA and kick him out *immediately*.", "Throw him out.", "Your brother is an selfish, entitled baby and an asshole.

He is going to flight school, so he should land just fine.", "NTA. If you can\u2019t kick him out and go NC with your family (because the \u201cgift\u201d was just a means of having control of you), then you must stop cooking for him.
