He doesn\u2019t have a job and is starting flight school in an area near my house. Things have been tense because he has a hard time being respectful of my space. \n\nLast night, as I\u2019m on my way home from work I called him and asked if he needed anything from the grocery. He asked me to get him all the ingredients to make sandwiches with (deli meats, cheese, bread, etc.). I bought him all the things he asked for in addition to the supplies I needed to make dinner. \n\nI get home and make a delicious dinner (cauliflower parm and pasta with homemade tomato sauce) that takes me almost 2 hours to complete. I made enough so both he and I could have a portion and I would have a leftover portion to eat for lunch today, since I have a busy day ahead of me and want a quick lunch I can microwave in a minute. \n\nHe finished his portion, looks at the pot with the leftovers in it and then TELLS ME, DOES NOT ASK, that he is going to eat the rest of the pot because he is still hungry. I told him no, I want the leftovers for tomorrow and he can make himself a sandwich if he\u2019s still hungry (he didn\u2019t pay me for the sandwich supplies either). \n\nHe then proceeds to get pissed and argue with me about how I\u2019m being selfish. He tells me to have fun doing all the dishes by myself, mimics my response like a 10 year old, and throws his dish in the sink. He called me a selfish asshole and a bitch before he went upstairs to slam the door to his room. Haven\u2019t spoken to him since. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m in the wrong here.
