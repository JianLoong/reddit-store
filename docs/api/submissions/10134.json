She\u2019s your fianc\u00e9 your health impacts her too. If the diagnosis is confirmed consider looking into support groups and anonymous resources so that you both can get what you need. \n\nAlso, given her friends are so far away it\u2019s not like they would bother you if you knew so it might be good if in time you allow her to talk to her friends about it once you have given things more time.", "No assholes here. Is that NAH? \n\nBut, she needs to be able to talk to someone that is not you. There are a lot of emotions for everyone in a situation like this and I guarantee you you do not want to hear or know everything she is feeling or thinking about it. Suggest a therapist because if this is a confirmed diagnosis she is going to need one and you should consider one as well. Like - just get one. Just do it. \n\nUnfortunate, as much as you would like to think that if this is confirmed that you will be \u201cfine\u201d and everything will stay the same and you can take care of yourself, that is likely untrue - especially with the vision presentation. \n\nYou may be mad, and I don\u2019t blame you, but she is also worried and concerned.

She's going about it poorly, but she's probably scared and reacting from a place of fear.", "NTA. You are allowed to tell anyone you want, it's your business. Asking her to keep your information private isn't unreasonable.\n\nWhat is unreasonable is her trying to make all this about herself saying \"how it's been messing with her anxiety and she just wants someone to talk to about it.\"  I get that she's scared but come on...that's not a reason to spread your business to everyone she knows, even to her best friends (that you've never met).", "NAH. But you are being unfair to your partner because you aren't her support system when she is facing your own life long illness. That isn't how the Ring Theory of support works. You are in the middle and the only thing the person in the middle ring gets is inward flowing support. Your partner needs people outside of you to help her retain perspective and strength. She needs people to hear her frustration and anxiety without adding to yours. \n\nIts understandable that you want to control this information but she needs an outlet who is not you. If not her friends, she needs to be encouraged to seek counseling. You can't demand she process her anxieties alone or only through you.", "NTA.

Her anxiety is not an excuse for her to share private information about you with others.

Either allow her some support, or let her go.", "While I understand your desire for privacy while things are confirmed and get sorted, you can\u2019t be her only support system.\n\nAs your partner if your diagnosis is confirmed this will affect her in a lot of ways. It\u2019s terrifying and MS is a condition that will get worse over time and will require more and more of her in terms of your care. That might not happens for years but it also doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019ve had a conversation with your fianc\u00e9 about how you both are feeling. \n\nMS is nothing to be taken lightly and while you may be able to be independent for a long time eventually that will no longer be the case.
