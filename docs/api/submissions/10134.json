I told my parents and siblings asking them not to tell anyone. Then told my fiancee (33f) and asked her not to tell anyone as well.\nEverything was ok until  yesterday when she overheard me telling a friend who is more like a brother to me. At this point she says \"I think you asked me not to tell anyone\" and I respond \"yes I did\". She then questions me telling my friend and ask why she cant tell her bestfriends, I pretty say well those are your friends not mine and remind her that I'm selective about who I share things with. She then starts talking about how it's been messing with her anxiety and she just wants someone to talk to about it because she wants to stay with me and she doesn't know how to care for someone with MS. I'm like first its pending and hasn't been confirmed  second  even if I do have it it's not as bad as it was generally  unless the worst case scenario happens I'll be able to continue working and care for myself, and if you want to talk to someone about my medical problems talk to me. \nAt this point she starts crying saying she tells her friends everything and that she hates lying to them when they ask what's wrong, she then says \" I guess you'll be my only support \". I get frustrated at this point and say \"f#$I it, I regret telling you do what you want.\" And walk off.\nFor context we been together for 5yrs I haven't met her bestfriends outside of Facebook because one is in Canada and the other lives about 4 states away.\n\nEdit post: I guess I should clarify a few things. First I didnt tell the people I told because I wanted their support or comfort, that's not how my family  is with me I told them Bec they knew about my eye and wanted to know the cause. Since being told about my possible diagnosis no one talks to me about it, asks how I'm doing etc it is just back to business as usual. Second  after I get an official diagnosis she I wouldn't have cared if she told her friends I just wanted her to keep it hush until then. But no I dont ever want jer to tell her family they arent good people  in my opinion at least not her parents she has to his from her parents that she is a pansexual because her dad doesn't like the LGBT community and our relationship almost ended due to her attempting to downplay  several diet racist comments he had made because she wanted me to like her dad. Not to mention the fact that he flipped from diet racist  to \"you need to hurry up and marry your bf because you need the benefits when she lost her job\" since I work for the state. Yea I dont like her parents and probably never will.", "created_utc": 1676569907, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113wjyu/aita_for_telling_my_fiancee_not_share_my_pending/", "score": 289, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But you are being unfair to your partner because you aren't her support system when she is facing your own life long illness. That isn't how the Ring Theory of support works. You are in the middle and the only thing the person in the middle ring gets is inward flowing support. Your partner needs people outside of you to help her retain perspective and strength. She needs people to hear her frustration and anxiety without adding to yours. \n\nIts understandable that you want to control this information but she needs an outlet who is not you.

Anyone who's dealt with disability knows that and to not have empathy for it... Smh.", "He told a bunch of people. She is \"less than\" to him. I am not sure he is capable of better. I hope she realizes it.", "They're engaged. MS can progress quickly. She is looking at a future with the possibility of early widowhood. He is not the only one hurting. He took immediate efforts to protect his own hurt, but insisted she suffer her pain and fear alone.", "You are being willfully and intentionally obtuse. She doesn't want to describe his bowel movements on Facebook or stop passersby in the street. She wants to be able to say to one or two close friends that she is scared for the well-being of her fianc\u00e9.", "NTA. As a disabled person I tell you to please be exceptionally careful when considering marrying this person. She is making your potential diagnosis all about her and her feelings, and not about you. If she needs support, she needs to talk to a therapist. Your health is about you, and how you're coping with it. Your body isn't a subject to be gossiped about.\n\nIf you do find out you have MS having an excellent partner is going to be an absolute must. Saying that she wants to stay with you but doesn't know how to handle being with someone who has a medical condition is a red flag, because if things get bad (and it can get super hard when you have a disability) she'll potentially use her anxiety as an excuse to pack up and leave. \n\nFigure out your health stuff and see her reaction to it before things go any further.", "NTA - it\u2019s your business to tell in the first place.", "OP it's your right to keep this potential diagnosis to yourself until something's definitive because you don't want unfounded news spreading without your knowledge and then Pandora's Box cannot be closed if it transforms into your deathbed if the testing comes up negative.  As few people as possible, until you know where things stand, then there's nothing to be gained by her telling all of her friends.  Even at that time, it's your choice as to what is said and to who.  If she's truly supportive of you, she'll understand it's not her choice to share with whoever she wants to because then it's showing a huge lack of respect spreading your personal news and crossing your set boundaries.", "Nta", "NTA she can talk to a therapist about it", "Im hesitant, but I do feel YTA. I\u2019m going to try my best to word this right. First, you have every right to your feelings about this very scary time. You are living with a progressive silent disease. My mom has MS, diagnosed for over 25 years. This shit is not fun. It\u2019s very understandable and fair to only be thinking of yourself right now. However, your fianc\u00e9 is facing this too. Obviously not in the same way as you, and she\u2019ll never fully understand what you go through. But her future just turned into one of taking care of a sick spouse. Because that is ultimately what you will be, and that\u2019s okay. She is scared for you, she is scared for herself. She probably needs to hear that she is capable of handling whatever may come. But by respecting your wishes, she now has no one to talk through this very scary time. No one to tell her that it\u2019ll be okay. Maybe you guys can find a compromise where she doesn\u2019t talk to her family, but can instead confide in a trusted friend? \n\nI hope this time can make you two a stronger couple. Don\u2019t let it push you two apart, keep communication channels open. It sounds like y\u2019all have gone through a lot together already, so don\u2019t let this stop you two. I hope the best for your relationship. And I hope the best for your health. Keep your mental health up so you can keep fighting for your physical health.", "Caring for someone with a life threatening and life altering disease is terrifying. Saying it's unreasonable for her to feel anxious about that and needing support from her friends is pretty ignorant.", "MS is a NEUROLOGICAL disease and can range anywhere from debilitating to zero disability. There is no way to know if OP will ever be significantly disabled by it and it's harmful to speak as if MS is an automatic disability guarantee.  It is not. Especially now.\n\nOther than that I agree with your overall comments.", "So you if you were in a relationship with someone and they were looking at a possible MS diagnosis you wouldn't be upset?", "Ignore the troll. \n\nYou have every right to want to process this in a way that suits you. This is happening to you first and everyone else second. \n\nOnce you know what's happening you can reevaluate your headspace.", "Well considering you\u2019ve replied yelling at the OP a dozen times and seem really angry at him, maybe you should also get off Reddit?", "Lol are you the gf? You're all over this thread talking about how it's abusive and controlling to tell her it's not her place to tell anyone about his medical issues before he's even had time to come to grips with it or gotten an actual diagnosis.", "MS is not necessarily a fast diagnosis.  I had a friend in high school who started showing symptoms in April and didn\u2019t get diagnosed until august.  It very well might have been months.  I didn\u2019t see a timeline in the original post.", "Oh not wanting strangers to know about your personal medical business is abusive and controlling? Please explain", "Not asking someone to tell people your medical business is not abuse! He hadn't got the diagnosis yet! There's somethings you don't share. Someone else's medical business is one of them. If OP had said yes you can tell people. It was medical business.  Therefore he can tell whoever he wants. Just because he wanted to wait until  HE had a DIAGNOSIS for HIS HEALTH", "Do you expect her to tell her in-laws she doesn\u2019t know if she can handle the new future?"]}
