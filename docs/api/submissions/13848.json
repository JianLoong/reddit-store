{"id": 13848, "submission_id": "12a1gk5", "title": "WIBTA for not taking in my brother's kid?", "selftext": "I 32f have two daughters, 6f and 3f. Both my husband and I have very lucrative degrees so we've been able to cut down hours to focus on being a family and still make a good living. I love being a mother, and I've always dreamt of being one. I put a lot of effort into being the best mother I can, people tend to compliment me on aspects of my parenting or how independent and responsible my 6-year-old is.\n\nI also got a younger brother 20m. He got a girl pregnant 8ish months ago. My whole family, except me, is pro-life. He convinced the girl to keep the baby, and as she didn't want to raise it, he made her sign away parental rights and promised to take care of the kid. My whole family congratulated him on making the right choice, I advised him to rethink but it's his choice in the end. \n\nA couple of weeks ago at a family function, we were planning on trying for our third kid soon and we will probably stop there as we only want three kids. My brother later called me and asked me to talk about something and if he could drop by my house because he wanted to discuss something. I agreed, today he showed up with my parents and between the three of them told me they got this great idea about how I should take my brother's kid. They explained it as if they were doing me a favor. Because they knew I wanted a third kid and I could just take him in without going through a third pregnancy. They also explained how my brother wanted to finish his degree and couldn't do that while raising a kid so this was the best alternative for both of us.\n\nI told them I didn't know and that I needed more time to think about it, but that I didn't feel comfortable in the position I was being put in because raising a kid is not something to be taken lightly. They were disappointed in my answer and after they left the three of them separately sent me a wall of text telling me to make the right choice and not deny love to a kid just because I am being selfish.\n\nI do not feel comfortable raising my brother's kid, but I can't explain a non-selfish reason why I don't want to. I like having biological kids, I feel one of our kids being actually my brother's kid would add such a complex family dynamic I don't feel ready to face and somehow I just don't feel it's fair. It's so easy to get all the pats on the back for \"saving a kid's life\" when you are not going to be the one to take responsibility in the end. I am helping perpetuate a family dynamic I feel has been going on for ages.\n\nWhen I told my husband he told me they are absolutely mental and should respect my reasons for not wanting to do something like this. But I still feel guilty because I am capable of taking care of the kid and if I don't step up I don't know what the faith of that kid will be.

What... He was expecting his family to care for it? No. It would be wise to sit down and explain to him that you are not going to raise a child he and your parents decided was better off with one parent, as that was the road they were going down before they knew you wanted a third child.", "NTA\n\nThis isn\u2019t a situation where the kids family all died and you\u2019re the best choice to take care of the kid. \n\nYour brother wanted to keep this baby. He agreed to take on all of the responsibility.

Absolutely not, and let's say you do take in this child, what is stopping him from continuing to procreate and dumbing them on your doorstep. It is extremely unfortunate for the child in question. However, he created this situation and should make the sacrifices parents have to make when they have a child so young. He doesn't get a free pass, and the fact your family is encouraging it is wild.  Why don't your parents adopt this child since they are so pro life? Oh, wait! It's because they too don't want to be responsible for the child either.", "NTA,  your family are the stereotypical myopic hypocrites that make up the so called \"pro-life movement\". Don't care, don't @ me unless you're contacting the OP right now to prove your fitness to have and are planning to make a serious offer to adopt this child.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to have a reason. Your brother\u2019s responsibilities and obligations are not yours. Simple as that.", "NTA.\nAmazing that your parents absolve your brother of his responsibility and expect you to take it up. That is seriously damaging behaviour.\nAlso nobody seems to have even considered your husband, like it's not also his choice.\nWhatever you do, do not change your mind.", "Your parents and your brother are trying to convince you to adopt his kid???

Your brother is being selfish. He is the one who is Pro-Life. He is the one who forced his partner to have a child.

As many Pro-lifers like to say \u201cYour brother needs to live with HIS choices.\u201d This wasn\u2019t an accident. He Purposefully put himself in this position. Honestly, he should give the child up for adoption. There are so many families who would give anything to have a kid. Or if he wants to keep it in the family than that responsibility should fall to Your parents or another \u201cPro-Life\u201d family member. I\u2019m totally fine with people being Pro-Life but you need to put your money where your mouth is and they rarely do. Pro-Lifers (that I\u2019ve seen) very rarely actually step up and adopt/take care of children. I would not do this. I would tell your family that child is Their responsibility Not yours. They are the ones being selfish. They demand that girl Have the child and now they are demanding someone else take care of it. No. They are selfish and should be ashamed of themselves.", "Definitely NTA. You are not obligated to take the child in. \nYou told him to be sure he was making the right decision. He, along with your parents encouragement, insisted on the girl having the baby and claimed he would raise it.  It\u2019s his responsibility now. Your parents can help him.

The ONLY time I would consider taking in a child in those circumstances is if my sibling passed away and I was the ONLY person who could take the child in.

Brother listened to family. Now they can raise it. Too late for your brother to decide not to be a man/daddy.", "NTA, your husband is right. They are batshit crazy for even suggesting this crap.\n\nYou absolutely do not need to explain a non-selfish reason, in fact your brother is being selfish to dump his own responsibilities on you, and your parents must be out of their minds for wanting to guilt you into this.\n\nStay firm, don\u00a8't cave in. Children are primary the parents' responsibility, and this kid will have two living parents who are too selfish to care about a kid they created.

If your parents are going to be this concerned about your brother, they can raise his kid themselves.", "NTA. \n\nYour brother made lots of choices for himself. He chose to have sex without taking proper birth control. He chose to convince a woman to have this baby when she didn't want to.

If your parents are upset over it let them raise it. They seem ok with his choices.", "NTA, LMAOOOO THE AUDACITY THEY HAD TO ASK. They should be for fucking real. They goaded that poor girl into giving birth and now your brother won't even take responsibility for it?

Or are using dumb dumbs against his religion?", "NTA. Your brother didnt die. Lots of parents go to school and look after a child/children.\n\nHell, my MIL was married for 20 years, her husband died after a 1 year illness, she didnt have a degree so went back to school and did a bachelors, raised 6 kids (between 4 and 16) and worked 6 part time jobs. \n\nYou are not selfish for not wanting to take on the responsibility of parenting a child that isnt yours. And what is the plan exactly, in 5 years when hes more stable he sweeps in and takes the child?  Your parents and him are on another planet.", "NTA - Fuck around pro-life, find out pro-life.", "This does sound convoluted. What will he be to the child? Dad, uncle...?

It\u2019s a baby, not a sweater. It\u2019s not up to you and your husband to fix your brother\u2019s mistakes, and it was pretty horrible and selfish for him to pressure the biological mom to go through the pregnancy when she didn\u2019t want the baby.", "Absolutely NTA your brother is going to learn something named accountability and responsibility. Not your monkey not your business.", "Nta.\n\nThem putting the offer to you was a good idea.   I mean some people (me) already planning to have a third child would think themselves fortunate to have this baby.    As a golden opportunity for my benefit, not a charity thing for the kid and my brother.   But then, my pregnancies were horrible.\n\nBut you aren't me and are 1000x reasonable to say it isn't for you.  I understand the emotional tie you may have for your own biological child and some mothers treasure pregnancy bonding time.", "Nta. Your family wants you to assume their burden in raising the child. There are consequences  to your brother's actions. Its pathetic your parents are in this scheme too.", "Why aren\u2019t your parents taking in the child?", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to be able to put your finger on any non selfish reason. When it comes to parenting decisions you SHOULD be selfish and only take on what feels right in your soul. Follow your gut.", "NTA. He's the one that insisted that kid exist and then promised to take care of it. You may not have \"good\" reasons for refusing, but you don't need them. You want to have another baby yourself, which is perfectly fine. Your brother should have thought about finishing school.and all that BEFORE he had unprotected sex, cajoled his partner into giving birth, and promised to raise the kid on his own. That is entirely his own doing. He can either fulfill his promise or put the kid up for adoption.", "The child would be your biological nephew but it\u2019s not a good idea to adopt the child.

Volunteer to babysit occasionally but NTA for not being able to do it.", "NTA OP. Taking in your brother's child is a bad idea on so many levels that I almost don't even know where to start. Adopting a relatives child is almost always a risky idea, especially when it's the child of a close relative like a sibling.\n\n From your post alone I can tell that your brother would be a backseat parent/ fun bio dad who pops in & out of his childs life when convenient and challenges every parenting decision you make. Your parents would definitely back him up and try to put you in your place.\nThis would become an absolute nightmare when the child becomes a teenager and starts rebelling against you & your husband's authority because your not their \"real parents\".\n \nYou owe your brother nothing and he was the one wanted full custody. If your parents think your brother needs help they need to step up and take responsibility for the grandchild they wanted so much!", "OP, stop giving your family of birth info about your plans to have more children, you gave them this and now they are using it against you.  \n\nNTA, this is not your mess to manage, your brother literally fucked around and found out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
