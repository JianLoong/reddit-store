{"id": 13848, "submission_id": "12a1gk5", "title": "WIBTA for not taking in my brother's kid?", "selftext": "I 32f have two daughters, 6f and 3f. Both my husband and I have very lucrative degrees so we've been able to cut down hours to focus on being a family and still make a good living. I love being a mother, and I've always dreamt of being one. I put a lot of effort into being the best mother I can, people tend to compliment me on aspects of my parenting or how independent and responsible my 6-year-old is.\n\nI also got a younger brother 20m. He got a girl pregnant 8ish months ago. My whole family, except me, is pro-life. He convinced the girl to keep the baby, and as she didn't want to raise it, he made her sign away parental rights and promised to take care of the kid. My whole family congratulated him on making the right choice, I advised him to rethink but it's his choice in the end. \n\nA couple of weeks ago at a family function, we were planning on trying for our third kid soon and we will probably stop there as we only want three kids. My brother later called me and asked me to talk about something and if he could drop by my house because he wanted to discuss something. I agreed, today he showed up with my parents and between the three of them told me they got this great idea about how I should take my brother's kid. They explained it as if they were doing me a favor. Because they knew I wanted a third kid and I could just take him in without going through a third pregnancy. They also explained how my brother wanted to finish his degree and couldn't do that while raising a kid so this was the best alternative for both of us.\n\nI told them I didn't know and that I needed more time to think about it, but that I didn't feel comfortable in the position I was being put in because raising a kid is not something to be taken lightly. They were disappointed in my answer and after they left the three of them separately sent me a wall of text telling me to make the right choice and not deny love to a kid just because I am being selfish.\n\nI do not feel comfortable raising my brother's kid, but I can't explain a non-selfish reason why I don't want to. I like having biological kids, I feel one of our kids being actually my brother's kid would add such a complex family dynamic I don't feel ready to face and somehow I just don't feel it's fair. It's so easy to get all the pats on the back for \"saving a kid's life\" when you are not going to be the one to take responsibility in the end. I am helping perpetuate a family dynamic I feel has been going on for ages.\n\nWhen I told my husband he told me they are absolutely mental and should respect my reasons for not wanting to do something like this. But I still feel guilty because I am capable of taking care of the kid and if I don't step up I don't know what the faith of that kid will be.

What... He was expecting his family to care for it? No. It would be wise to sit down and explain to him that you are not going to raise a child he and your parents decided was better off with one parent, as that was the road they were going down before they knew you wanted a third child.", "NTA\n\nThis isn\u2019t a situation where the kids family all died and you\u2019re the best choice to take care of the kid. \n\nYour brother wanted to keep this baby. He agreed to take on all of the responsibility.

Absolutely not, and let's say you do take in this child, what is stopping him from continuing to procreate and dumbing them on your doorstep. It is extremely unfortunate for the child in question. However, he created this situation and should make the sacrifices parents have to make when they have a child so young. He doesn't get a free pass, and the fact your family is encouraging it is wild.  Why don't your parents adopt this child since they are so pro life? Oh, wait! It's because they too don't want to be responsible for the child either.", "NTA,  your family are the stereotypical myopic hypocrites that make up the so called \"pro-life movement\". Don't care, don't @ me unless you're contacting the OP right now to prove your fitness to have and are planning to make a serious offer to adopt this child.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to have a reason. Your brother\u2019s responsibilities and obligations are not yours. Simple as that.", "NTA.\nAmazing that your parents absolve your brother of his responsibility and expect you to take it up. That is seriously damaging behaviour.\nAlso nobody seems to have even considered your husband, like it's not also his choice.\nWhatever you do, do not change your mind.", "Your parents and your brother are trying to convince you to adopt his kid???

Your brother is being selfish. He is the one who is Pro-Life. He is the one who forced his partner to have a child.

As many Pro-lifers like to say \u201cYour brother needs to live with HIS choices.\u201d This wasn\u2019t an accident. He Purposefully put himself in this position. Honestly, he should give the child up for adoption. There are so many families who would give anything to have a kid. Or if he wants to keep it in the family than that responsibility should fall to Your parents or another \u201cPro-Life\u201d family member. I\u2019m totally fine with people being Pro-Life but you need to put your money where your mouth is and they rarely do. Pro-Lifers (that I\u2019ve seen) very rarely actually step up and adopt/take care of children. I would not do this. I would tell your family that child is Their responsibility Not yours. They are the ones being selfish. They demand that girl Have the child and now they are demanding someone else take care of it. No. They are selfish and should be ashamed of themselves.", "Definitely NTA. You are not obligated to take the child in. \nYou told him to be sure he was making the right decision. He, along with your parents encouragement, insisted on the girl having the baby and claimed he would raise it.  It\u2019s his responsibility now. Your parents can help him.

The ONLY time I would consider taking in a child in those circumstances is if my sibling passed away and I was the ONLY person who could take the child in.

Brother listened to family. Now they can raise it. Too late for your brother to decide not to be a man/daddy.", "NTA, your husband is right. They are batshit crazy for even suggesting this crap.\n\nYou absolutely do not need to explain a non-selfish reason, in fact your brother is being selfish to dump his own responsibilities on you, and your parents must be out of their minds for wanting to guilt you into this.\n\nStay firm, don\u00a8't cave in. Children are primary the parents' responsibility, and this kid will have two living parents who are too selfish to care about a kid they created.

If your parents are going to be this concerned about your brother, they can raise his kid themselves.", "NTA. \n\nYour brother made lots of choices for himself. He chose to have sex without taking proper birth control. He chose to convince a woman to have this baby when she didn't want to.

If your parents are upset over it let them raise it. They seem ok with his choices.", "NTA, LMAOOOO THE AUDACITY THEY HAD TO ASK. They should be for fucking real. They goaded that poor girl into giving birth and now your brother won't even take responsibility for it?

Or are using dumb dumbs against his religion?", "NTA. Your brother didnt die. Lots of parents go to school and look after a child/children.\n\nHell, my MIL was married for 20 years, her husband died after a 1 year illness, she didnt have a degree so went back to school and did a bachelors, raised 6 kids (between 4 and 16) and worked 6 part time jobs. \n\nYou are not selfish for not wanting to take on the responsibility of parenting a child that isnt yours. And what is the plan exactly, in 5 years when hes more stable he sweeps in and takes the child?  Your parents and him are on another planet.", "NTA - Fuck around pro-life, find out pro-life.", "This does sound convoluted. What will he be to the child? Dad, uncle...?

It\u2019s a baby, not a sweater. It\u2019s not up to you and your husband to fix your brother\u2019s mistakes, and it was pretty horrible and selfish for him to pressure the biological mom to go through the pregnancy when she didn\u2019t want the baby.", "Absolutely NTA your brother is going to learn something named accountability and responsibility. Not your monkey not your business.", "Nta.\n\nThem putting the offer to you was a good idea.   I mean some people (me) already planning to have a third child would think themselves fortunate to have this baby.    As a golden opportunity for my benefit, not a charity thing for the kid and my brother.   But then, my pregnancies were horrible.\n\nBut you aren't me and are 1000x reasonable to say it isn't for you.  I understand the emotional tie you may have for your own biological child and some mothers treasure pregnancy bonding time.", "Nta. Your family wants you to assume their burden in raising the child. There are consequences  to your brother's actions. Its pathetic your parents are in this scheme too.", "Why aren\u2019t your parents taking in the child?", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to be able to put your finger on any non selfish reason. When it comes to parenting decisions you SHOULD be selfish and only take on what feels right in your soul. Follow your gut.", "NTA. He's the one that insisted that kid exist and then promised to take care of it. You may not have \"good\" reasons for refusing, but you don't need them. You want to have another baby yourself, which is perfectly fine. Your brother should have thought about finishing school.and all that BEFORE he had unprotected sex, cajoled his partner into giving birth, and promised to raise the kid on his own. That is entirely his own doing. He can either fulfill his promise or put the kid up for adoption.", "The child would be your biological nephew but it\u2019s not a good idea to adopt the child.

Volunteer to babysit occasionally but NTA for not being able to do it.", "NTA OP. Taking in your brother's child is a bad idea on so many levels that I almost don't even know where to start. Adopting a relatives child is almost always a risky idea, especially when it's the child of a close relative like a sibling.\n\n From your post alone I can tell that your brother would be a backseat parent/ fun bio dad who pops in & out of his childs life when convenient and challenges every parenting decision you make. Your parents would definitely back him up and try to put you in your place.\nThis would become an absolute nightmare when the child becomes a teenager and starts rebelling against you & your husband's authority because your not their \"real parents\".\n \nYou owe your brother nothing and he was the one wanted full custody. If your parents think your brother needs help they need to step up and take responsibility for the grandchild they wanted so much!", "OP, stop giving your family of birth info about your plans to have more children, you gave them this and now they are using it against you.  \n\nNTA, this is not your mess to manage, your brother literally fucked around and found out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Part of the reason this guy was such a mess is that he saw his birth mother all the time at family functions. She had gone on to have more children and he constantly wondered why he wasn't \"good enough for her to keep.\" Birth mom also said some very toxic things to him about not being wanted. But he was too proud to get the therapy he needed, so he's still messed up 20+ years later.\n\nI'm not saying this will happen to you definitely, but understand the risks involved in adopting from your own family.

How does that square with giving it to you? \n\nTell them you would be disappointed in them if they did not live up to their own standards. That taking a stand should involve sacrifice on *their* part, not yours. That having opinions about theoretical children is not the same as dealing with a real one. Then cut all contact. NTA.", "I\u2019m stuck on the whole he can\u2019t have a kid and go to school. Thousands of single moms are expected to raise kids and go to school every day. OP\u2019s brother should be no different.", "And what happens with the next woman he gets pregnant? I'm assuming he won't learn much if there are no consequences at all for him.", "Especially since you know brother is going to want to duck in and out of this poor kid's life, maybe even take the kid back full-time once they're old enough to be \"fun\". There's no way this would work out well for OP or that kid. NTA.", "If the brother was sent to prison and the kid was going to foster care I might have mixed feelings, but she's for sure not responsible for his poor insight.", "Exactly. OP is not the asshole. Her brother talked the girl out of the abortion with the understanding he would raise the child.", "It's like they think they're gifting her a car because she needs one and they aren't using it.", "Pro birth, not pro raising and taking care of kids", "> when he\u2019s six years old your brother would demand him back or try to micromanage you.\n\nOP's parents will feel free to micromanage OP's parenting of this child from day one.", "And OP also has every right to say no.", "From the wording, I'm pretty sure OP meant \"fate\", rather than \"faith\".  Probably autocorrect.", "I was scratching my head too but I have a feeling OP meant \"fate\" and it was a typo or autocorrected.", "What? The kid isn\u2019t actually born yet. OP doesn\u2019t say that she even knows if it\u2019s a boy or a girl.", "That part was very obviously a typo.", "It's actually very Christian to explain to someone that they have to deal with the consequences of their own actions (not \"allowing\" the mom to have an abortion for a kid she didn't want, making her sign away her parental rights, and then going oops! I don't actually want to parent!)\n\nThey are choosing not to take in a child that is 100% the brothers responsibility, not dumping a newborn on the street like the already deadbeat dad wants to do.", "I don't see ANY selfishness on OP's part.  It is not her child, and it would only complicate her relationship with her brother and family, and end up causing discord.  I see plenty of selfishness from her brother and parents,  however.", "> Also, there\u2019s a good chance OP\u2019s brother will ask for the child back in the future when and if he\u2019s settled. \n\nOr he finds the next girl he waves to impress about how responsible he is.", "I think your last phrase is essential: cut contact with these invasive hypocrites, if at all feasible.\n\nIt's at times like these that I yearn for the ancient Greek pantheon: at least Zeus could hear your prayer and smite some people with a lightening bolt!", "This 1000%. I know so many women that have done it with no child support coming in at all.", "A small distinction with a huge difference!\n\nOP even urged the brother to think his anti-abortion rhetoric through!", "Oh, yeah, he and the parents would be all up in OP's business.  They'll all be trying to control how she raises the kid and undermining OP's authority behind her back because brother wants this or that for the kid.  And yes, they'll insist on visitation whenever brother wants, which will be incredibly disruptive every single time brother drops in and then drops out of the kid's life.\n\nOP needs to die on this hill.  There is no way this would turn out well for anyone, including the kid.", "I completely agree. He should stand by what he said he would do. If I was his sister would lay into him what a disgusting embarrassment he is. And those parents Enabling him! Insane. I mean what happens when he knocks up another girl? Big sister isn\u2019t running an orphanage. \ud83d\ude44 Honestly, sister should probably see if she can get into contact with birth mom and if not I\u2019d report to child services if she thinks the child isn\u2019t being truly cared for. People like her brother and parents make me so angry. Especially when there are couples out there with fertility issues that would be 10x better parents.", "Agreed! NTA!\n\nAlso, you can be a loving and stabilizing presence in the child's life as an aunt.", "this happened to my mom when she tried to help her sister by raising her son\u2014sister got to be \u201cfun\u201d parent, dropping in and out as she pleased, while my parents did the daily work. It lasted a year, sister took the kid back rather than follow \u201crules\u201d (also known as good parenting and healthy boundaries) and it was a disaster for the kid. NTA.", "OP is NTA.\n\nUnfortunately I agree with you. The moment tbey banded together and asked, they set forth a series of events.\n\nOP doesn\u2019t take the baby. Then brother and parents are mad that OP wouldn\u2019t take the baby in. \n\nOP takes the baby in. Let\u2019s even assume that brother signs over parental rights and OP fully adopts the child. Eventually brother and/or the parents are going to be pressuring OP to let brother do this or that with the child. If the child doesn\u2019t know that their father is their father, then OP\u2019s other kids won\u2019t understand why they get special attention. If the kid knows that the brother is their father, that will still create a complex dynamic. Brother may demand more control over *his* child than is legally or morally appropriate. And if brother continues to be irresponsible and not think of his actions, he may flit in and out of the child\u2019s life, demanding the child\u2019s attention when the brother wants it and not when the child needs it. There\u2019s going to be all sorts of family regardless.\n\nOr worse, maybe he doesn\u2019t sign away his rights. Baby lives with OP got five year then brother wants his baby back. Parents support brother. OP misses window to have third child AND there is a messy legal battle going on. The poor child will not know what is happening.\n\nI\u2019m sorry OP.", "[removed]", "No, they\u2019re trying to make her bank roll taking care of the kid. They probably think she\u2019ll take care of it but not legally adopt or some garbage like that. \u201cOh, you can be the legal guardian for now.\u201d I can hear the convo."]}
