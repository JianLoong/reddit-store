Out of my three children he was the one who remained close with me into adulthood. I have no problem with my other two children they just never really reach out anymore. My son left behind two dogs. I don't have the energy to care for two dogs. I decided to keep the older one because it requires less care. My co-worker has a soft spot for animals. She is young and can walk the puppy and give him the care that he needs to live a happy life. I dropped the puppy off at her house on Tuesday. I felt this was a nice decision because this co-worker is trustworthy and I can still arrange puppy playdates when I have the time. It's not like the dog will never be seen again by this family. Well, when my son's girlfriend learned that I rehomed the dog she was pissed. She told me my son would never approve of this. She told me she was like a mother to the dog and that it would be lost without her. She used harsh words and told me that I should have offered the dog to her first. My son's girlfriend has honestly been a mess since his passing and I thought adding a puppy to the mix would just push her over the edge.\n\nEdited to include:\n\nMy son lived with me so it's not like she was living with the dogs and I snatched them up.

I can't imagine what youre going through.\n\nHonestly, whenever you post anything about rehoming animals, youre gonna be TA. And for the most part I would agree. \n\nBut, given the context, the son sounded like he lived with you, so the girlfriend isnt entitled to the dog. You initially didnt see her as being fit to care for the dog, so you gave it to someone who you would have consistent contact with to continue being able to see you/the older dog you still have and who can give it good love and care. You thought about the dog and, while the gf may have cared for the dog given the connection she saw with your son, at the time, she didnt strike you as the best fit person in the longterm for a younger pup. Its a sad situation obviously. But, while I cant say yeah the gf wouldnt be good for the job, youre not an AH for rehoming a pet to a place where ties wont necessarily be severed (I dont know the likelihood of the gf continuing a close relationship with you all) and where he will be given proper care.

You both saw the dogs as yours now and you both have a point. But legally and morally they are yours to place where you think it's best for them.

I\u2019m so so sorry for the loss and I can understand the girlfriend wanting the dogs as to have a piece of him still, but as she wasn\u2019t particularly close with the dogs, I don\u2019t think what you did was wrong or unreasonable. And she was aware that this discussion was going on and didn\u2019t express any concerns until after this was done.", "NTA...  They were yours to do with as you pleased & it sounds like you found a very nice home for the puppy.  \n\nYour grieving to after all, it was YOUR son.

However, you two should be supporting each other. I totally understand your reasoning but you are both grieving and it might have been the kind thing to do, to at least offer her the dog first.", "I would say NTA given the circumstances, but I do think you should have checked with the gf first. Were I in gf\u2019s position, I would have been upset too but I understand your reasoning and I think it\u2019s sound. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "NTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s not her dog she didn\u2019t pay for or live with them. She had no right to act like that with you", "NTA. You found a good arrangement for the dog on top of everything else you\u2019re dealing with. Maybe you could have offered her the dog but your heart was in the right place. Of course gf is grieving too but that\u2019s no excuse to take her feelings out on you.", "NTA. If your son and his girlfriend had lived together, I'd be entirely on her side. But they didn't. The dogs were completely his and their care has fallen to you. You can't handle both so you did the right thing, and it sounds like you found a great home. She's grieving and its understandable she's upset, so hopefully she'll get over it with some distance and time.  \n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "In my opinion the biggest factors are how long she\u2019s been with your son, how responsible she is  and wether she has a good place to keep him. You\u2019re not a bad person for finding someone who met those standards. Plus if she really loved the dog why didn\u2019t she ask for him/her", "I'm so so sorry. \n\nNAH - I think you should have at least asked her instead of deciding on your own that she couldn't handle the puppy.", "I would never call a mother who is grieving TA but you really should have asked his girlfriend first. She is grieving  too and maybe the dog would have given her some comfort. I am feeling really bad for her right now so I will end it here.", "It's really not fair to compare their grief or diminish the girlfriend's grief just because their relationship was short.  I'm not saying she gets to be an asshole, but this is a cold take.", "The dog is not a grieving tool. The dog is with someone who is emotionally stable right now.

I dunno. The fact the dog lived with the mom and the son bc he didnt live on his own and the fact the gf didnt live there doesn\u2019f really mean they could even \u201cget one together\u201d  It\u2019s not like they lived together and got it as part of a family. The mom has more than likely been the caretaker of the dog before he even died. It\u2019s not like the dog split time btwn the houses either", "Then I guess if I change my mind I'll edit this but I lean towards gf being a (slight) AH for taking out her grief on a mother who is also grieving.", "I don't think it's about deserving. Even if they had only been dating for 7 months, losing a partner at any stage of your relationship is traumatic. I think it would have been extremely kind for OP to ask the girlfriend if she wanted (and could handle) the dog that she had already bonded with with her boyfriend over time. They didn't live with each other, but I still think it would make more sense than a random other friend. \n\nLike if my friend died and her boyfriend couldn't take care of their cats, I would really hope that he would go to her family first, and then to me as I've spent a good chunk of time catsitting for them and have a bond with them even though I've moved away (I am planning on moving back to the area soon and her family isn't local anyways). I'd be so sad if he decided to give the cats to a random coworker that had never met the cats before.", "Same with people who don't want kids at all shouldn't get into serious relationships with people who have kids.\n\nI've read way too many posts about that on this sub.", "Right? Yet life is not black and white and reading this sub it seems there is only black and white is just a fairytale... I am more than sure there are plenty of people who go along with their lives not caring they had to rehome animal for the sake of relathionship and those who won't care much about their stepparent not being lovey-dovey. They just don't ask if they are AH... :)", "It sounds like, without much evidence, you are jumping to the conclusion that the gf spent more time with the dogs than OP is saying. Sure, we can speculate anything at that point. Maybe the gf provided financial support for them too and OP didnt mention it. Or maybe the gf took them for walks every day!\n\nExcept, we have zero reason to believe any of that at this point. You're projecting how you would feel and your own experience here. Which I understand, but it isn't the same situation.\n\nWhat is relevant is OP 100% spent more time with those dogs and cared more for them. And we know gf tried to guilt trip OP out of grief. No one called her an AH for *being upset* as you put it. I said she would be a slight AH for guilt tripping. Because thats a horrendous thing to do to a mom. **But** I sympathize with the gf so it is a light judgment of that situation. Normally, someone guilt tripping a grieving mom would be a massive AH. I dont think gf is. I think she let her grief get the better of her, which is fine but still her actions were cruel.\n\nThe mom did not have to ask her. The dog is not a keepsake to remember someone who passed. It is a living being. OP states in comments as well that she had mentioned rehoming the dog in front gf priot but gf didn't say anything. Its an awful situation for everyone. But gf took out her grief on someone who is also grieving, which is an AH move. Understandable, and doesn't mean she is bad. But its still an AH move.", "NTA", "NTA Your son and his dogs lived with you.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nGirlfriend can pound sand. She didnt live you, your son and the dogs did.", "NTA, she could just ask the new owner to give her back and if they paid any money, well pay it back, this new owner sounds like a nice person and might (or might not, you never know) understand and cooperate in this situation.", "Everyone reacts diffrently to grief if she didn't offer to take the puppy right away. Then that is not on you.  If the dog is happy where it is. Then leave it there.  She sound more upset over losing a puppy than a person.  Also, is it a purebreed? If it cost something they may be upset over losing how much a dog like that would cost.   Lots of red flags here. And you would think as the girlfreind she would have more compassion for the Mother who just lost their son.  Pretty toxic red flags here. But maybe you can offer her time with the dog you kept. Take walks together and you can talk about your son. But if she is angry at you. Then please block her since she will just take her grief out on you.

If you had dumped the dog on an animal shelter or given it to a stranger on the internet, you absolutely should have asked the girlfriend first, but you find a good home for it with someone you know.\n\nThat said, if you trust that the girlfriend could also be a good dog owner, you might want to tell your coworker about the situation and see if the dog could be returned. I can see why it might mean a lot to the girlfriend to own this particular dog, and it might help her get through her grief, while your coworker could probably easily find a different dog to adopt. The gf is acting like a bit of a jerk right now, but if your criteria is that the dog needs to go to a young person, I can see why she was upset you didn't ask her first.", "NTA.\n\nI know it is a hard time, but your son's GF could have made it known if she wanted to take responsibility of one or both dogs. Instead she didn't communicate when you took steps to make things easier for you to manage.

You made sure that puppy has a good furever home! That\u2019s what\u2019s important.

If she was bonded to them, she would be visiting them. The last thing an animal needs is to be a crutch for grief, and if she were to take the dog, it would be an emotional decision on her part.
