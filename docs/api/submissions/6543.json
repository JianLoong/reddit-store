Out of my three children he was the one who remained close with me into adulthood. I have no problem with my other two children they just never really reach out anymore. My son left behind two dogs. I don't have the energy to care for two dogs. I decided to keep the older one because it requires less care. My co-worker has a soft spot for animals. She is young and can walk the puppy and give him the care that he needs to live a happy life. I dropped the puppy off at her house on Tuesday. I felt this was a nice decision because this co-worker is trustworthy and I can still arrange puppy playdates when I have the time. It's not like the dog will never be seen again by this family. Well, when my son's girlfriend learned that I rehomed the dog she was pissed. She told me my son would never approve of this. She told me she was like a mother to the dog and that it would be lost without her. She used harsh words and told me that I should have offered the dog to her first. My son's girlfriend has honestly been a mess since his passing and I thought adding a puppy to the mix would just push her over the edge.\n\nEdited to include:\n\nMy son lived with me so it's not like she was living with the dogs and I snatched them up.

I can't imagine what youre going through.\n\nHonestly, whenever you post anything about rehoming animals, youre gonna be TA. And for the most part I would agree. \n\nBut, given the context, the son sounded like he lived with you, so the girlfriend isnt entitled to the dog. You initially didnt see her as being fit to care for the dog, so you gave it to someone who you would have consistent contact with to continue being able to see you/the older dog you still have and who can give it good love and care. You thought about the dog and, while the gf may have cared for the dog given the connection she saw with your son, at the time, she didnt strike you as the best fit person in the longterm for a younger pup. Its a sad situation obviously. But, while I cant say yeah the gf wouldnt be good for the job, youre not an AH for rehoming a pet to a place where ties wont necessarily be severed (I dont know the likelihood of the gf continuing a close relationship with you all) and where he will be given proper care.

Because thats a horrendous thing to do to a mom. **But** I sympathize with the gf so it is a light judgment of that situation. Normally, someone guilt tripping a grieving mom would be a massive AH.

NTA, especially since it sounds like you made sure the person taking care of the puppy is a good fit. I do think it would have been thoughtful to ask the girlfriend,  though I understand your reasoning. 19 years ago, 3 months after a break up with a guy I was with for six years, his pets that he kept after our break up were offered to me. I took them. A turtle and iguanas. I was not good at taking care of them, which is a big reason he kept them. My mom noticed and told me to say bye, and took them to a pet store to be rehomed. I was relieved and very thankful to her to this day. He had a dog, but the dog died shortly before he did, or I would have also taken the dog. I'm better at taking care of cats and dogs so I think that would have been okay, I had a dog and cat of my own I took care of. But I was struggling with grief, and my mom had to help snap me out of it because I just...couldn't function well. So I do think it's an okay assumption that she may struggle. My cat, that my ex got for me, lived on until a few years ago. She was a living memory of him. Losing her (of old age she was 17) was really hard. So...it could also be that the puppy was a way to remember him for her and now she doesn't even have that. It's a difficult spot to be in.", "NTA.  It really sounds like you were very thoughtful and did what was best for the dog.  I'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA, if she'd lived with the dog, that would be different, but not if the dog lived with you.", "Going against the grain, but NAH. I get your intentions but she should of been the first one you asked.", "Ehh I don\u2019t know this one\u2019s kind of iffy. You really should\u2019ve talked to the girlfriend about it if she had a relationship with the dog. If my boyfriend passed I would definitely want to care for his dog before it went to a stranger, regardless of how well it will be cared for. The pup lost one family member, it could\u2019ve at least gone to someone familiar\u2026 not going to say you\u2019re TA because there\u2019s no ill intent and it\u2019s understandable to not be thinking 100% clearly right now. I\u2019m sorry for your loss", "I don't think anyone is an AH, but I would have definitely gone about this a different way.  Yes, she is grieving your son, and I'm sure she is now grieving the loss of this puppy.  Before making this decision, you both should have sat down and discussed it.  \n\nSomeone asked you if the gf and the pup were close, and you said...you don't believe so.  What does that mean?  The son and his dogs lived with you.  Did she not interact with them in front of you?  I have friends that see my dogs once or twice a month that are still very close to my pups.  Two of them have actually asked me to leave my pups to them in my will in case I die.  You know if someone had an attachment to a dog or not.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA - My heartfelt condolences for your loss. She is lashing out in grief and being a little selfish in doing so. You did the right thing by rehoming the puppy with someone who can give it the good home, love, and attention needed.", "I'm so sorry for your loss. Rehoming this puppy is NOT something you should feel guilty over. It was the most responsible and kind decision you could have made for the dog, during a very difficult time.\n\nThe GF is probably in the \"anger\" stage of grief. While I sympathize with her, (and I'm sure you do as well),  you do NOT have to bear the sharp cuts and rebuffs of her grieving process. If she cannot be civil, she will have to just be angry alone.\n\nNTA.", "NTA Op.\n\nWhile a dog, an established family member can help someone grieve, it too is a living, breathing being. Not a tool to be used. \n\nIf the girlfriend of less than a year was really attached to the puppy it should have been the first thing out of her mouth. Support the girl as much as she needs, yes, but the dog should be given the same exact consideration.\n\nWhich it sounds to me like you did. You found someone who can raise a PUPPY. And as someone who just raised 2, I couldn't have done it while grieving. The energy it takes to train and excercise a dog is something that I don't think I, personally, could do in that state. And I have VERY active breeds (Shephard and Husky mix). They. Are. A. Lot.\n\nDepending on the breed of the dog GF may not have been able to meet the demands, especially while grieving which would be cruel to the animal. \n\nI applaud you for caring about both GF and Dog, OP.", "NAH. Given your edit, I think the girlfriend was in a worse mental/emotional state than you or she realized and it was only a matter of time before something pushed her over.\n\nDoes \"it was being discussed\" mean she was offered the dog and refused, or does it mean she heard you considering getting rid of the dog but didn't know you were actually going to do it? Offering her the dog first probably would have been best, as she could make that call for herself, but it's too late now and maybe finding something else that was really special to your son to give to her could help ease the pain.", "NAH.\n\nIdeally, you would have asked her first.  You didn't realize that would be a viable option.  That doesn't mean you're required to commit to care beyond your ability to give.  You didn't neglect the animal, you found it a loving home.\n\nSorry for your loss.", "NTA. My condolences on your loss. However, his girlfriend has no say in how any of your son's property was to be disposed of. If your son didn't leave a will, the usual expectation is the nearest of kin has rights to inherit. If you found a good home for the dog that you couldn't care for, all the better. His girlfriend may be feeling the loss so she may act [out.](https://out.You) YOu may want to offer her a keepsake of your son, if she wants something to remember him by.", "NTA", "It isn't her decision to make. These were your son's dogs, and you made the best decision you could make for their wellbeing, as well as yours. It isn't her say.", "NTA, because really the only reason you guys only had as far as you can remember one conversation about these dogs, is because she wasn't showing up and being a part of their lives.\n\nSo in comparing herself to being their mother, she is saying that she was their mother, who's in abandoned them with their grandma after the death of their dad. If she's comparing herself to being a parent to these animals, she's saying she's an absentee parent who abandoned them.\n\nYou were the one taking care of the dogs, she was the one not showing up or asking for custody of them in any way. It was your place to rehome that dog with someone who could take care of them. You did right by the dog by getting them a good home, and you have no moral responsibility to take care of the emotions of this woman who was leaving you with the dogs. If she was capable of taking care of that animal and wanted to, she would have", "Yes YTA\n\nSorry for your loss though", "I don't agree that most rehomes are TA moves.  My caveat would be that the decision should always be made with respect and care for the animal and their best interests.  Sometimes, it's worse for an animal to keep them than to rehome them.\n\nI agree 100% that most of the common reasons for rehoming sound like TA territory.  The details leave some nuance, but I almost never hear the decision to rehome in terms of the animal's needs.", "\"going against the grain\" as if every person who defended gf hasn't gotten downvoted to oblivion", "She knows the girlfriend. She doesn't know her coworkers ability. She assumed the girlfriend couldn't take care of it rather than asking.", "One of the OPs comments basically say that the GF was not overly fond or attached to the dogs...", "She told GF she was going to be rehoming the dog. \nGf said nothing. Then it happened. That's when GF got upset.\n\nThe MOMENT tehoming was mentioned, the GF would have spoken up has she really wanted the dog for anything more than a tool to grieve.", "Why? The girlfriend was a GF for less than a year and the dogs lived with the OP. How is a random girlfriend entitled to a dog that did not live with her?\n\nDogs are family members.

She was rehomed and charges pressed on her and the junk yard she called to take his car.", "Just found that. She said she didn't offer the dog to her, GF probably felt mom wouldn't have let her take him.

He's our family.\n\nBoth are grieving.  Both are entitles to grieve. But a living being isn't easily forgotten about even in times of grief.
