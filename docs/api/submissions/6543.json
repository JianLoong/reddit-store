Out of my three children he was the one who remained close with me into adulthood. I have no problem with my other two children they just never really reach out anymore. My son left behind two dogs. I don't have the energy to care for two dogs. I decided to keep the older one because it requires less care. My co-worker has a soft spot for animals. She is young and can walk the puppy and give him the care that he needs to live a happy life. I dropped the puppy off at her house on Tuesday. I felt this was a nice decision because this co-worker is trustworthy and I can still arrange puppy playdates when I have the time. It's not like the dog will never be seen again by this family. Well, when my son's girlfriend learned that I rehomed the dog she was pissed. She told me my son would never approve of this. She told me she was like a mother to the dog and that it would be lost without her. She used harsh words and told me that I should have offered the dog to her first. My son's girlfriend has honestly been a mess since his passing and I thought adding a puppy to the mix would just push her over the edge.\n\nEdited to include:\n\nMy son lived with me so it's not like she was living with the dogs and I snatched them up.

I can't imagine what youre going through.\n\nHonestly, whenever you post anything about rehoming animals, youre gonna be TA. And for the most part I would agree. \n\nBut, given the context, the son sounded like he lived with you, so the girlfriend isnt entitled to the dog. You initially didnt see her as being fit to care for the dog, so you gave it to someone who you would have consistent contact with to continue being able to see you/the older dog you still have and who can give it good love and care. You thought about the dog and, while the gf may have cared for the dog given the connection she saw with your son, at the time, she didnt strike you as the best fit person in the longterm for a younger pup. Its a sad situation obviously. But, while I cant say yeah the gf wouldnt be good for the job, youre not an AH for rehoming a pet to a place where ties wont necessarily be severed (I dont know the likelihood of the gf continuing a close relationship with you all) and where he will be given proper care.

You didn't just give his dog away to just anyone, you gave it to someone you knew is trustworthy and an animal lover.", "nta", "NAH, it's just one of those misunderstandings. You both saw the dogs as yours now and you both have a point. But legally and morally they are yours to place where you think it's best for them. It depends on how close they were, however raising her ex's dog for the next 15 years can't be that great for her future. She can adopt other dogs if she wants to raise any.", "NTA. Puppies are hard work, so you were very responsible in giving it to someone you know has experience with animals.", "NTA You did what was in the best interest of the puppy and that's what matters.

You should have asked the girlfriend if she wanted to keep the dog before giving it away.", "Sorry for your loss.\n\nThat said YTA \n\nThe most basic common sense and consideration would have been for you to ask the gf if she wanted the dog(s).

Either way, it's some nonsense I'm sure you'd rather not have to contend with right now.\n\nWhen someone passes away, their pets take on new meaning - whether the girlfriend was close to them or not.

Dogs can be an extension of one\u2019s life, like family.  When the dog owner dies, family generally have a connection to their lost loved one through the dog (or other pet).

They're both grieving and I read that as the gf wanting to make OP feel like a horrible mom for her choice, which is extremely scummy.

I don\u2019t want to seem like an AH, but how old was your son?", "Sorry I thought spouse was interchangeable with partner, i will edit that. But according to your comments they were together about 7 months. That\u2019s not that short. It\u2019s not that long either but 7 months with someone can change your life. Some people have had lifelong marriages after 7 months together. So I understand what you\u2019re saying but she was still close enough to him that it\u2019s typical to ask her first before you ask basically a stranger to him that would have zero connection with his belongings or animals. \n\nI definitely think it\u2019s SOFT Yta because you\u2019re grieving and making hard decisions that I can\u2019t imagine.
