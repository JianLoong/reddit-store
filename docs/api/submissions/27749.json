Physical attraction may wax and wain, but you're supposed to love your spouse regardless.  Does he think he's still going to be hot stuff at 80?  If that joke bothers you (and it would bother me), I'd encourage you to discuss it with him separately.\n\nSecond, your main question: your husband has gained some weight and will neither put in the work to slim back down nor will he stop bringing up excuses for his current weight.  It doesn't sound like you even mind that he's this size, you just can't stand to hear the constant self-delusions.\n\nIf you try to address that delusional talk with kindness, NTA.  \"Honey, you keep saying that this isn't you, but it's been you for three years.  You either need to take steps to slim down or accept that this is you now.

Would you like me to help you make some dietary and lifestyle changes so you can eat healthier and get more exercise?  It's ok if you don't, but please stop talking about it if you aren't going to try to slim down.\"\n\nOn the other hand, if you just start ripping into him, YWBTA then.

Fat is the natural state of the old.", "YTA. You got relationship problems you really need to work on. Being mad at your partner all the time over petty stuff is immature at best.

Frickin *do something about it!* Or, at the very least, quit making excuses that nobody asked for. \n\nIt\u2019ll be much, ***much*** easier to approach that kind of conversation if the weight is treated as irrelevant, and the behavior is the main issue. \n\nThe things he said early in the relationship were shallow, immature, objectifying and misogynistic.

It\u2019s hard but I think we need to encourage people to love THEMSELVES (not their body) while working to obtain a body which is healthy. I\u2019m not sure how to do that other than by trying to change the way we look at physical appearance and health and teach better habits from a young age. Maybe intentionally teach portion control and encourage non-sedentary hobbies like we teach brushing your teeth and encourage reading (as a starting place anyway - it\u2019s much more nuanced and complicated then that!)
