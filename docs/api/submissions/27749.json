Physical attraction may wax and wain, but you're supposed to love your spouse regardless.  Does he think he's still going to be hot stuff at 80?  If that joke bothers you (and it would bother me), I'd encourage you to discuss it with him separately.\n\nSecond, your main question: your husband has gained some weight and will neither put in the work to slim back down nor will he stop bringing up excuses for his current weight.  It doesn't sound like you even mind that he's this size, you just can't stand to hear the constant self-delusions.\n\nIf you try to address that delusional talk with kindness, NTA.  \"Honey, you keep saying that this isn't you, but it's been you for three years.  You either need to take steps to slim down or accept that this is you now.  I'll love you either way, but it isn't healthy for you to keep lying to yourself like this and I can't stand to hear it anymore.  Would you like me to help you make some dietary and lifestyle changes so you can eat healthier and get more exercise?  It's ok if you don't, but please stop talking about it if you aren't going to try to slim down.\"\n\nOn the other hand, if you just start ripping into him, YWBTA then.  He was definitely being an asshole to you with the fat jokes, but that wouldn't justify being an asshole right back.", "NTA. If he\u2018s fat he\u2018s fat. There is no beating around the bush about such a fact. It sounds like he does not want to accept it as he is continuing to say that he is meant to be this fit and lean guy. Being around someone like that is bound to get beyond annoying and given his comments at the beginning of your relationship, I can completely understand your frustrations. Just be aware that his reaction to you telling him he\u2018s fat will not be pleasant. Be ready for that.", "Nta. Dude needs to deal with his serious fat phobia what a bore. What if you just start saying out loud some mantras like \u201cthe size of a person\u2019s body is morally neutral\u201d \u201cbetter to be fat than be an asshole\u201d \u201cthere are much more interesting things to talk about than body size\u201d", "I'm (not) sorry to say this, but your husband is an asshole", "I would\u2019ve dumped him after the first \u201cjoke\u201d about not loving me anymore if I got fat.", "NTA, sounds like he needs to hear it", "NTA it's such a double standard with the fat, men are allowed to have beer belly but god forbit a woman after a couple of kids have a belly.  you can find the words to just tell him without being vindictive(or be vindictive it's not like he doesn't deserve it) that he should either accept that he has belly and body far or join a gym.\n\n He can complain as much as he wants but you don't have to listen. and if it really bothers you as much and you are full of resentment as i m sensing, be ready for the relationship to be done.", "So you married a hypocrite. One rule for you, another rule for him. \n\nYou can joke about how he doesn\u2019t have to worry, you two can be fat together\u201d and see his reaction. Tell him, if he can be fat, you\u2019re going to be fat too. And if he\u2019s angry, tell him he can\u2019t take a joke.\n\nBut know deep down this man doesn\u2019t offer you the same level of care that he expects from you.", "NTA but say it nicely and explain why what he said before hurt you so much and was so fucked up and highlight that you\u2019re sharing this now not because you love him any less but because you want him to understand his hypocrisy and reconsider his anti-fat sentiments", "NTA and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s joking.", "Your husband is an immature child and now a hypocrite. He would ridicule the crap out of you if it was the opposite. Point this out and give him one chance to repair his body. Otherwise, enjoy your slug.", "NTA lucky for him you aren't the type to leave someone because they got fat...but maybe acknowledge his fat in a different way, like, \"Don't worry honey, I still love you.\"", "NTA - you should go with the lollipop comment, that\u2019s just freakin hilarious", "Nah you are fine. He knows he is fat. He was there when it happened lol", "NTA \u201cyou\u2019ve been saying that for 3 YEARS now\u2026this IS your usual shape now!\u201d\n\nOr, \u201cso you appreciate the irony/hypocrisy of all the times you said you wouldn\u2019t love me if I got fat, right???\u201d \n\nI mean, you do have to stop and think what your main goal is. If you want him to lose weight, you should probably be gentle about pointing out that he has gained wait and then like your friend suggested try to find solutions\u2014cooling healthier, active hobbies, etc. if  you just want him to know he\u2019s an asshole, I wouldn\u2019t blame you, and have at it! :)", "Well, he is clearly in denial. You don't have to tell him he's fat. He knows. Maybe something jokey, \"Husband, you used to have the six\\~pack, but now you've got the keg.\"", "YWBTA for just telling him outright that he's fat.  How about something like \"if your nature is to be trim and in shape, you should work at it\" and leave it at that.\n\nThe time to address his stupid comments about leaving you if you got fat was when he said them.", "Tell him he's fat. If he can joke about your weight, you can comment on his. Sounds like he let himself get into some unhealthy habits and there's nothing wrong with telling him he needs to correct himself. \n\nAlso, yeah, you would be TAH, but he's being one too and I don't think it's fair that he gets to be one and you don't.", "YTA, because you want to throw his past comments in his face instead of addressing the real issue, which seems to be about honesty and expectations in your relationship. Sure, he's hypocritical, but that doesn't mean you have to stoop to his level. If you're sick of hearing his denial, there are more constructive ways to approach it rather than just saying, \"You're fat.\" That's just a petty \"gotcha\" moment, not a solution", "Nta call him fat an divorce him.", "Then he needs to get back into shape. Fat is the natural state of the old.", "YTA. You got relationship problems you really need to work on. Being mad at your partner all the time over petty stuff is immature at best. Also pretty hypocritical to be mad at him making comments and then wanting to do the same to him.  You want to say this just to be an a$$hole to him. Y'all will likely end in divorce at this rate.", "Just suppose, you had gained a similar amount of weight, and he told you, you\u2019re fat. He made stupid jokes in the past, and might regret it now. Get a gym membership together, and quit feeding him between meals.", "Reddit is not a good place for marital advice or body weight issues. Most of the replies will be from deranged unmarried folks who believe in body positivity. \n\nTell him he\u2019s fat and being a hypocrite and tell him to lose weight. Can you even stomach having sex with him? It\u2019s pathetic if one partner gets obese after marriage and even more pathetic if they\u2019re telling you you can\u2019t get obese. Which frankly is fair if he upheld his end.", "NTA - Obviously, all fat people are lazy bastards and they need to be told to shake that laziness off and go get some work done.", "ESH. It bothers you but you aren\u2019t being constructive. He\u2019s just in denial and you as his partner need to help identify his negative pattern so he can feel good about himself.  \n\nHe\u2019s an a-hole for the conditional \u201cjoke.\u201d", "Yta - just get some couples counselling", "Next time he comments about his weight, reassure him that you love him regardless, then suggest that you make changes together to get slimmer and fitter(I know you don't need to).", "Just get it over with and call him a Fatty", "ESH. His comments early in the relationship were an asshole move, but coming back with the same would be an asshole move as well. It's fine to tell him you don't care/you don't want to hear him talk about it, etc, but specifically calling him fat when he considers fat to be a negative thing would be an asshole move.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Are you wanting to show him how cruel he was initially? What is your goal? It just feels like his reaction would be bad, based off what his comments.

For ***years!*** It\u2019s kind of irrelevant that it\u2019s about his weight, because OP honestly doesn\u2019t care so much about that. She\u2019s irritated that he\u2019s basically trying to (vocally, repeatedly) hand-wave/wish it all away. That\u2019s the kind of thing that makes a significant other gradually lose respect. Like, ok, you recognize there is a problem. Frickin *do something about it!* Or, at the very least, quit making excuses that nobody asked for. \n\nIt\u2019ll be much, ***much*** easier to approach that kind of conversation if the weight is treated as irrelevant, and the behavior is the main issue. \n\nThe things he said early in the relationship were shallow, immature, objectifying and misogynistic. Maybe he\u2019s become less of those things in the intervening years. But the current state of things sure does have a whiff of poetic justice. I just hope he pulls out of this rut he\u2019s clearly driven himself into. OP deserves better.", "thank you for this.  i love him fit or fat and do not want to be mean, it doesn't feel good to be mean to him. your language sounds kind but firm.  \n  \nthis is helping me see that because one thing makes me thing of the past, it does not mean that they are the same problem!", "Yeah. It seems like he\u2019s really internalized \u201cfat == lazy/stupid/undisciplined\u201d.

I would also get him to therapy if he needed it and make sure he took his meds if he was ill - physical or mental. Idk what vows you took but unless your partner has become abusive, you shouldn\u2019t be looking to bail on them. Apparently in sickness and in health was a lie to you? Would you abandon your kids if they got mentally ill or overweight too? \n\nDude you are 100% AH and I hope she divorces you and finds someone who actually loves her."]}
