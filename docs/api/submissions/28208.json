But in reality- DEFINITELY have a will & guardians.", "I don't disagree that they're chances are incredibly positive given their situation. But dude, no significant behavioral or medical needs? These 2 kids just lost their parents and have to leave their home for a new family. \n\nLook my mom has friends who got kids like the ones in this situation; they lost their loving parents but were otherwise healthy well adjusted normal kids and my mom's friends did EVERYTHING right. Therapy, love, support  and these kids were STILL fucked up just from losing their parents and ended up knocked up and drugged up. \n\nHowever, that is all the more reason why OP shouldn't take the kids, they are going to need A LOT of extra love, attention and therapy and it wouldn't be good for them to go to a home where they aren't wanted.\n\nThe unfortunate truth is that this is just a shitty situation for OP and the kids where there isn't a guaranteed solution where everything ends up alright. Certainly there is a chance that things might end up all rightGrandparents are assholes though. \n\nAnd my aunt was a social worker for decades. I've heard this story and more from her time and time again Yes, there are great families of people who want kids like the ones in the story that will provide an absolutely wonderful home. but they're too many kids and not enough families to go around.", "It really is realistically yep they want healthy, white kiddos who are young enough to assimilate into their family and have very little trauma that will cause issues down the line. \n\nThese are the kids who are the best case scenario to be in the foster system looking towards adoption.", "Adoption from foster care is paid for by the taxpayers. People who \"can afford to adopt\" are adopting privately.", "Please don't feel bad about the downvote's. some of us understand the concept of empathy.", "Yeah I don\u2019t know how sick they are but I\u2019ve seen many grandparents have to take in grandkids and do an amazing job at it. It\u2019s common in places with drug epidemic unfortunately.", "Yes, there will be trauma from losing their family. Hopefully, the grandparents will be able to remain in their lives, though. And we've not been told that the kids have any needs on top of the trauma.", "Plus if OP took the kids, the GPs would find a way to make his life hell and at the very least would be unbearable nuisances. NTA.", "Telling OP's Mother to forgive her cheating husband on her deathbed?  Who are these people?", "It\u2019s actually proven that as long as they are physically capable they are the best option for the children, even if they were 70 and tired. Children are always traumatised by being taken away from the family they know. Always. That\u2019s just the truth of it. OP isn\u2019t the solution though, the children don\u2019t know him and would experience trauma going to him.\n\nFoster care will allow the grandparents to keep some rights and have the kids on weekends and holidays most likely.", "And had to see the mistress show up with his dad at his mother\u2019s funeral. The dad is truly horrendous.", "The word god is literally in the title. Where? Which \u201carea\u201d uses that title for a guardian named in a will, but not named in a religious ceremony?", "Acknowledge what? The non-lethal use of a term in connection with a comment that is from a purely legal standpoint?", "plus the economics of caring for young children on SS.", "There really is not that much there to ask for tbh. Especially not when you factor in the things that aren't just money based, like having energy to keep up with small children, being physically able to bend down to take care of them.", "Copy and pasted from Wikipedia.  \"In denominations of Christianity, a Godparent (also known as a sponsor, or gossiprede)[1] is someone who bears witness to a child's baptism (christening) and later is willing to help in their catechesis, as well as their lifelong spiritual formation.[2] In the past, in some countries, the role carried some legal obligations as well as religious responsibilities.[3] **In both religious and civil views, a godparent tends to be an individual chosen by the parents to take an interest in the child's upbringing and personal development, to offer mentorship or claim legal guardianship of the child if anything should happen to the parents.**\" This isn't some secret use of the word", "I'm not sure I'm following your point. My point is that term Godparent has meaning beyond what the person I replied was claiming.  Quite literally if you look up godparents on Wikipedia one of the definitions is \"In both religious and civil views, a godparent tends to be an individual chosen by the parents to take an interest in the child's upbringing and personal development, to offer\u00a0mentorship\u00a0or claim\u00a0legal guardianship\u00a0of the child if anything should happen to the parents.\" So when the original commenter used the phrase Godparent and was told by the person I was responding to that original commenter was wrong in how she used the phrase, that wasn't true.  People colloquially use the terms in more than purely religious practice.  It has nothing to do with legalities, as most people hardly ever use legal terms right.  There's lots of phrases for guardians beyond the legal phrase.", "Imma be arthritic as hell by 70. My mom's not even 50 and she's got it and I've already had bone issues."]}
