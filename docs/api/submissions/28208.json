His family also tried to get my mom to \"forgive before it's too late\" while she was still alive. It was a nightmare. I was 15 and it was a lot.

This is actually the kind of situation that appeals to foster to adopt parents: 2 kids, under 6-ish, who haven't been abused or neglected. Parents are dead and extended family isn't able to take the kids, so reunification isn't on the table. Frankly, they really could be adopted in 6 months or so, depending on your state's timeline.", "NTA. You have no obligation, morally or legally, to raise someone else\u2019s children. If they\u2019re so worried about it, then they can raise them and pay for extra help. I\u2019m so sorry for the loss of your mom, I know that never truly goes away. \n\nDo what is best for you and what will make you happy in the long run. Congratulations on your first baby coming soon!!!", "Actions have consequences and your father's actions sadly impacted the lives of all three of his children profoundly.\n\nYour Grandparents need to be contacting all of the extended family on both their side as well as your step mother's side of the family to try to find a family member willing to take on the children. What happened to those children is truly tragic.", "NTA.\n\nYour grandparents hoping to fob off their responsibility onto you is unconscionable.\n\nThey are projecting their own monstrousness onto you and your wife.\n\nAsk them where they were when you--their other grandchild--were fifteen and trying to care for your dying mother.\n\nForget they exist.", "Ask  them\nWhere were you when i was 15?", "NTA - while I do have empathy for the children, they are not your responsibility.", "NTA. I feel terrible for the kids, to lose both parents at such a young age, but you're not responsible for them. If your grandparents really can't care for the kids themselves, they should be contacting extended family, including the mother's side of the family.", "NTA - you\u2019re not an asshole for not wanting to be the guardian of estranged family members\u2026.it certainly is a very difficult position to be in though.", "NTA. Your grandparents chose to support your cheating father who abandoned your dying mom along with his 15-yr old child to care for her. They are now choosing to put their grand kids into foster care. These are choices they made out of their own free will. You are not obligated to support their choices. NTA.", "So to be clear\u2026 The people who had a relationship with the children chose to turn those children over to foster care - simmering they believe us basically handing the kids over to be SAd (weird they don\u2019t think boys get SAd) but someone else is the monster here? \n\nIf they ever contacted me again all my responses would be focused on those above facts. \u201cYou don\u2019t think the people who knew them and who they loved and trusted and chose to hand them over to what they believe is a life of abuse is a monster? YOU made that choice, which one of us is the monster again?\u201d\n\nNTA", "NTA, you don't even know those kids and you never have to take kids in. Not to mention you've got your own kid on the way and need to focus on being a first time dad to a newborn, not a first time dad to multiple kids all at once. You have a duty to your wife and if the grandparents wanted support they should've supported 15 year old YOU instead of covering for a sick adulterer. They made their own bed, they can lay in it. Block them on everything and move on.", "NTA, this is not your responsibility or duty, it's disgusting that you are being hounded in this way.", "NTA", "NTA \nIt sounds to me like they want you to take the kids so they still get the fun parts of being a grandparent. They acknowledged that they can not raise them but expect you to? It\u2019s a sad story for all involved but ultimately not your problem.", "Report to police for harassment", "NTA. Even if they were you loved and knew these kids it wouldn't be on you or your wife to take them. You are very young, newly married and having your own baby. It's not wrong to want to have this time with you, your wife and new child. It is what it is. Some people would take them in if the circumstances were different and others wouldn't. Based on the situation I absolutely wouldn't be able to. I wouldn't put a strain on my own marriage or family. If my husband brought home half siblings he'd never met, he'd be doing this on his own. I only signed up for raising my own children and grandchildren if necessary.", "NTA", "NTA.  There are a lot of kids in foster care. Are you supposed to take in all of them, too? You don't know these kids. You are only related to them by blood because your father couldn't keep his pants zipped. You're doing what's right for you.  Your grandparents should be ashamed of themselves.", "NTA. I\u2019d have gotten a a restraining order.", "NTA\n\nAnd I'm sorry your sperm donor was so horrible when your mom died", "NTA but it is a sad story. These kids are innocent - they did nothing wrong, and they'll be the ones paying for their parents' sins for their entire lives.", "NTA OP.\nThey treated you and your mother terribly and the fact that they cursed  their own great grandson shows that they deserve no grace from you or that matter anyone.", "NTA. I feel sorry for the kids, but they're no more your concern than any stranger's kids would be.", "NTA. This is tragic for those kids but none of it is your fault. \n\nYour grandparents are the ones who should be ashamed of themselves. They raised a man who cheated on his dying wife and left his child to fend for themselves during and after her death. That is absolutely despicable. Now they are abandoning their own grandkids and letting them go into care. \n\nIf you haven't already, I would suggest blocking them and be done with it.", "OK so I was a foster kid and I have a literal fuckton of unresolved trauma that I'm working on unpacking because of it... foster care is a broken system that's way outdated and abuse and neglect are way too common... that being said, those are also common in \"families\" like this where responsibility is forced rather than accepted (which I also have trauma from) so honestly, I do think you made a wise choice not only for yourself, but also for the kids. There are good families out there and resources for them if your \"grandparents\" really want to help those kids.

Good Luck with your new baby.", "NTA - and now you know why your father did what he did and why.  He was raised by selfish people who don\u2019t care about anyone else, they only care about getting what they want regardless of everyone else\u2019s feelings.

Who's the monster here? \n\nAlso to be pragmatic if they are two toddlers that are white. Tons of rich white childless couples will fight to adopt them. They may have a better shot at life being adopted by people that have the resources time and love to care for them.  Then by 1/2 a sibling being forced into something he resents out of duty.

Understandable. They are not your responsibility. However, these kids aren't to blame for your father's actions. They're not to blame for your grandparents deciding they were going to put them in foster care. I could get behind the NTA label if some part of you were willing to put a modicum of effort into helping these kids in some way, even a little.

This is unfortunately a longterm side effects of the *you\u2019re older, so you should be more mature\u2019* trope.\n\nI would ask them the difference between when they too left you out in the world **when they are your family** just as they are these children. In that way these people are unfortunately treating you all with the same across the board there. Apparently that\u2019s what family means to them.", "That makes a lot of sense. They could already be with a family who will keep them forever. Doesn't sound like my grandparents like the sound of that.", "Thank you. It doesn't. Watching someone you love die a very painful death is the worst feeling. I wish I could have done more to help her but I was a kid.", "From what my aunt was told nobody else wanted them. My father's siblings all made excuses. His wife's family all had nothing to do with her for many years before she died and don't want anything to do with the kids she left behind either. My grandparents were the only ones willing which is why they took them temporarily. Who knows if that's true or not but that's what they were ranting at her.

You don\u2019t even know these kids. Don\u2019t let your grandparents guilt you, if it\u2019s that big of a deal they should have kept the kids and found a way to get a nanny or something, and if they can\u2019t then I guess they know how much goes into raising two small children and should understand why you can\u2019t take on the responsibility. \n\nFocus on your family and your baby, congratulations!", "In some states, CPS could draw up an open adoption agreement, so even if/when the kids are adopted, the grandparents could still have visitation rights.", "They are the ones responsible for putting the kids in foster care not you. You were a stranger to them, grandparents were not.", "Truly, as far as foster to adopt. These kids are going to have less trauma, and they\u2019re both young.  And there isn\u2019t likely to be a possibility of reunification. If there are no disabilities or illnesses the children will not be in the system long. And honestly if they\u2019re white it will be next to nothing for time.", "With kindness, I\u2019m sure the social worker can and has covered this with the grandparents. OP doesn\u2019t need to relay messages to them. It doesn\u2019t seem like the grandparents have ever really cared about the best interests of their grandkids."]}
