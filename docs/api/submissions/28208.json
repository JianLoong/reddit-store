From that kids perspective, you're probably a pretty big doody head.\n\nWe can never tell what is going to happen in life.

At the very least, I would encourage you to work w/ your grandparents and try to stay connected and support your family who literally are innocent children that never did anything wrong with you. Who knows, they might turn around and save your life one day, or donate you a kidney or something.

I might be mad at them, or sad, or not care much, depending on my prior relationship with them and how much I comprehended of death and fostering and adoption.\n\nAt age 6 or 7 I\u2019d still want them to visit like they had all my previous life.  I wouldn\u2019t want to lose them the same time as my parents.\n\nNow, if my parents surrendered me to a foster home and then wanted to visit - probably still yes.  If I loved my parents.  Plenty of kids with divorced and distant parent still want the one who \u201cgave up custody\u201d to visit.\n\nI\u2019ve only known a handful of foster kids well, but most of them did still want contact with whoever surrendered them.  Unfortunately even if they were abusive and neglectful.", "Yes. It's better than the alternatives, which are either:\n\n1. Grandparents keep the kids, despite not having the mental/physical/financial ability to care for them. Kids end up neglected, save possibly having to become caretakers as the grandparents continue to age\n\n2. They get outright abandoned by the only family they know and their trauma ends up being worse (because being removed from your home by CPS is traumatic no matter what), because they have no real way to understand why their grandparents gave them up. They will feel that abandonment even if neither of them end up remembering their grandparents.\n\nThe kids should have a right to keep those bonds and understand their roots (as long as bio family isn't a danger to them, which they aren't in this case). They can decide as they get older if they want that connection or not, but they do not have the emotional maturity to make that decision now.", "I don't think trying to guilt other people into raising children should be considered \"trying.\" Plenty of grandparents get custody of and raise their kid's kids when needed. People seriously overestimate the effect of age on anyone over middle aged. It's like people think that as soon as you hit 50 you turn into the crypt keeper. These grandparents are being unfair. They need to put up or shut up.", "It is, why they didn\u2019t care about op? Trying to first pressuring him to forgave the father, then wanting him to raise his kids, they burned that bridge a long time ago, they don\u2019t really care", "I agree. The kids here are simply collateral damage. They had the misfortune to be born to assholes, in a full-asshole family, but have done nothing to deserve the cards they've been dealt. I'm sad for them, OP has no responsibility towards them, nor should they be made to feel like they should, but these kids didn't wrong OP at all, they've been left in a terrible position by the same person who wronged OP. That, in itself, I would've thought would create some empathy, but OP has none for these kids.", "Culture isn't the law. De facto isn't the same as legal standing. Parents, especially single parents, need to legally designate guardians for the minor children by whatever the law is in their country. The courts of most countries (particularly secular countries) don't give a rat's ass about god parents.", "Lucky you. I grew up Catholic too. When my dad died, my godmother (his sister) disappeared from my life, never to be seen or heard from again. My godfather continued in my life, but all he ever did was give me gifts, he was never there when I actually needed him as a teen. So yeah, don't depend on god parents, make LEGAL guardians for your kids, and FFS, ask the people you want to leave your kids with first!", "It doesn't even sound like they're actively trying to find an alternative to OP. I heard a story, just as an example, of a set of sick grandparents raising grandkids who got their pastor to send out an email and announce in church that they were seeking adoptive parents. Kids were adopted within a  year, both GP passed away not much later. They're pinning all there hopes on OP when there's literally thousands of parents who would stage a Hunger Games for two young, healthy, unabused children.", "Dad was bad. Paternal grandparents seem bad. They expect OP to be a candidate for Sainthood? Heroics are never to be expected or required.\n\nWish those innocent but not really siblings well. Dad stopped being a Dad, so those kids aren't siblings. Who would be expected to take care of strange kids when other strangers that actually want them are probably out there.\n\nBiology does not make people families.", "Seems to me that OP\u2019s father is the monster, stepping out on his ill  wife.  \n\nI feel bad for the children, this is not their fault.  I can\u2019t imagine raising my fathers affair children.  I would resent them even though it is t their fault", "To be fair, the grandparents are presumably in their 60s or even older. Their health **may** be deteriorating. Taking on small children at that age might not be in the best interests of the kids anyway.\n\n(Still think they're AHs for attempting to guilt OP into taking on their bio half sibs).\n\nNTA", "The grandparents weren\u2019t there got OP when he was 15 and taking care of his dying mom, while dad screwed around. \nHard to understand why they\u2019d expect anything different.", "Just like I feel terrible for OP who also lost both parents at 15", "This get my \"Gold Award\"", "They have the right to keep those bonds, but the logic of the arrangements don't matter to the kids as much as how they feel about them.  If I were one of those kids, I would reject these people who abandoned me.  If I was 5 and forced to spend time with them, I sure wouldn't be pleasant.", "They aren't fresh grandparents of a 5 year old. They're also grandparents of a 26 year old, meaning they're almost certainly in very late 60s or 70s. \n\nThat doesn't make OP obligated to care for the kids nor does it make it fair for the grandparents to harass and guilt OP. But it does mean it's not exactly fair for people to blame the grandparents for not \"caring\" when they've taken the kids in so far and will be past average US life expectancy before the kids are adults.", "I never said he had responsibility towards them, but his post is dripping with undeserved animosity for them.", "I'm not debating anything along those lines, I was merely pointing out that some areas use the terms future guardians in case of death and god-parents interchangeably.  In other words, if the parents leave it in their will that the children should go to John and Jane Doe if they die, many will refer to John and Jane Doe as the children's god-parents.  Sometimes it has nothing to do with religion.  The person I was responding to didn't seem to acknowledge/know that.", "They could ask for assistance from social services if they really wanted to keep them.", "Yeah chances are they are 70s minimum, probably older. OP is 26. If dad had OP at 20 and they had OP's dad at 20, that's already 66. So it's very likely that they truly *can't* take care of two small children. \n\nThey're still ta for the guilt trip and OP is NTA", "So? Grandparents take in their grandchildren even in their 60's. They need to just put their money where their mouth is.", "Yep. I said I agreed with you.", "Social services is extremely limited in what they can do.", "Idk, I'm already decaying at 30, the grandparents sound like awful people but I totally understand their inability to deal with 2 kids under 5 at (assumingly) 60 plus.", "And some people have health that makes it unsafe for them to care for small children. \n\nThese people are very likely in their late 60s or early 70s. The average lifespan for an American is around 77 years old. It\u2019s not unreasonable to think these people are starting their path to dying.\n\nYou can\u2019t muscle through heart failure or diabetes.", "Ah soz misread x"]}
