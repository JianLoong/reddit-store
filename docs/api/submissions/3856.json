My friend \"Jane\"  (18F) held a sleepover a few days ago for her 18th birthday with some other friends, when planning Jane said she wanted us to try her homemade pizza and homemade cake for desert. I spoke to Jane later and told her I couldn't eat what she'd make due to my allergy  but I can bring my own food as I know any free from food can be quite expensive, at least where I live it is. \n\nJane said it was fine for me to bring alternative food and apologized for forgetting I was gluten free. I ended up  bringing a gluten free pizza (and cookies) with me to the sleepover and Jane put it in the with the rest. One of Jane's other friends that I don't know very well \"Beth\" saw and started going on about how it was rude to bring food when Jane went out of her way to make us a homemade meal. Even after us both explaining why Beth said that it was still rude and I should have just sucked it up as it wouldn't kill me to eat a small amount. She was right, it would have just made me violently ill. \n\nJane made her drop it but once it came time to eat Beth started up again and it got worse when she saw that I had brought cookies as well. Everyone else seemed more understanding as to why but did agree I could have just sucked it up for one night. So I explained in great detail what happens if I had just 'sucked it up' and asked if they would say up with me the rest of the night while I delt with the aftermath of eating it. It seemed to shut everyone up for the night but it was extremely awkward for the rest of the night.\n\nThe next day I started feeling bad for ruining the mood and apologized to Jane for spoiling her sleepover. She said it was the others fault for being so ignorant and she thought I handled the situation better then she would've but I still feel bad so AITA?\n\nEdit: just want to add as I see some people using she/her for me, I am a boy.

Second, you explained without going into detail multiple times from the sounds of it. They are the ones that kept pushing the issue until you were left with little choice but to educate them or deal with their BS the rest of the night. I say kudos to you for saving yourself the grief.", "NTA.  If you'd just offered up the info without provocation, then yes that would have been an assholio move.  But considering Beth kept harping on you about it and was starting to get other girls at the sleepover to agree with her, it was time for some education on what 'sucking it up' looks like for you.\n\nAlso, I hate when people get fussy about food allergies and intolerances.  It costs $0 to not be an asshole about other people's dietary needs.", "NTA. I have little patience for people who, after being told that someone has a food sensitivity, seem to not hear that information. You clarified a number of times, and had all the right to go nuclear. Everyone knew Beth was being a jerk; she ruined the mood, if anyone did. I\u2019m sure the rest of them were probably just annoyed at the dynamic Beth created with her food nagging. Food is very personal and people need to STFU about other people\u2019s food choices, allergies or otherwise. \n\nI was waiting to read that she switched the foods just to make you eat gluten and was relieved that did not happen. You handle yourself most appropriately OP, and Jane sounds like a good friend too.", "NTA. Beth should've\n 1. Kept her mouth shut. It was Jane's party, and if Jane and you already sorted things, it's not Beth's business.\n2. Once Jane said she was OK with it, and Beth kept on, she said it wouldn't kill you to suck it up and eat it for one night. You explained it was an ALLERGY. That's when Beth should have stopped as well. The fact that she got others to join in and agree that you should suck it up is peer pressure, and not fair to you or Jane. \n3. You did handle the explanation with gross detail, but sometimes that's what is needed.  In addition, allergic reactions can grow worse over time and repeated exposure. I'm allergic to a bunch of food items and have increasingly bad reactions when I eat them, so it's definitely something you CAN die from. Beth's snarky little comment, \"It won't kill you...\" is something I've already snapped back to with, \"Actually yes, it CAN kill me because eating something  I have an allergy to is like poisoning me!\"\n\nAs for feeling like an asshole because it was Jane's party? Didn't she already tell you she was all good with how things played out?  Give yourself a break, and next time, tell them, \"So, you dislike me enough to wish that I die from an allergy?\"  It's amazing how fast they shut up!", "NTA. My wife is also sensitive to gluten, although it sounds like not as severely as you. She's had a restaurant serve her a meal before that was marked GF but contained gluten. She felt different almost immediately and paid for it for several days after. Sounds like your friend who actually made the food was understanding, and \"Beth\" is just a sh*tty person. Don't spend any more mental or emotional energy on what \"Beth\" thinks about anything.", "NTA. Instead of Beth understanding you have an allergy she decided to throw a fit.

Maybe now they will.", "NTA, Beth kept poking till she got the whole 9 yards.", "NTA - it's not just a dislike for food but a legitimate allergy. You have every right to keep yourself safe and had made these arrangements WITH the host of the party. The other friends can understand or mind their own business. You handled everything as well as you could handle it given the situation.", "NTA. The only opinion that should matter was Jane\u2019s opinion. It was her party and she said yes to your compromise so you could join the party. Everyone else is irrelevant and all the girls suck for being judgmental and not understanding until you went into details. That\u2019s on them and not on you.", "NTA \n\nPeople's diets are extremely personal and private. It is no one else's business what you put in there.\n\nNo, I don't think it's rude to bring your own food if you have dietary restrictions, I think it would be rude to expect someone to cater to your dietary needs.\n\nWith that being said and with no judgment on your friends part, for me personally, I actually feel it's rude not to at least attempt to cater to a person's diet when they are a guest in your home. I also know from personal experience how expensive and sometimes difficult it is to properly prepare a gluten free meal.\n\nThe idea of courtsey bites is ridiculous to me. I'm convinced it's a concept thought up by narracists to try and emotionally manipulate people in to eating their food.\n\nHer friend was being a huge asshole, ultimately what you did had no effect on anyone, it's insignificant. On the other hand, asshole complaining kinda ruined the vibe of the party.", "NTA.  Jane understood and she's the only that would have needed an apology if she had wanted one.

But all those little bits of gluten add up and are destroying things over time. So what might not be happening on the outside sure is going on inside.

He was bummed I couldn't go out drinking with him.  I could, but like, all I could have was coke and non alcoholic drinks and he kinda whined a little bit that it was a bummer and not the same as social drinking with other folks consuming alcohol.
