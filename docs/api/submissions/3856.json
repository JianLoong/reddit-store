My friend \"Jane\"  (18F) held a sleepover a few days ago for her 18th birthday with some other friends, when planning Jane said she wanted us to try her homemade pizza and homemade cake for desert. I spoke to Jane later and told her I couldn't eat what she'd make due to my allergy  but I can bring my own food as I know any free from food can be quite expensive, at least where I live it is. \n\nJane said it was fine for me to bring alternative food and apologized for forgetting I was gluten free. I ended up  bringing a gluten free pizza (and cookies) with me to the sleepover and Jane put it in the with the rest. One of Jane's other friends that I don't know very well \"Beth\" saw and started going on about how it was rude to bring food when Jane went out of her way to make us a homemade meal. Even after us both explaining why Beth said that it was still rude and I should have just sucked it up as it wouldn't kill me to eat a small amount. She was right, it would have just made me violently ill. \n\nJane made her drop it but once it came time to eat Beth started up again and it got worse when she saw that I had brought cookies as well. Everyone else seemed more understanding as to why but did agree I could have just sucked it up for one night. So I explained in great detail what happens if I had just 'sucked it up' and asked if they would say up with me the rest of the night while I delt with the aftermath of eating it. It seemed to shut everyone up for the night but it was extremely awkward for the rest of the night.\n\nThe next day I started feeling bad for ruining the mood and apologized to Jane for spoiling her sleepover. She said it was the others fault for being so ignorant and she thought I handled the situation better then she would've but I still feel bad so AITA?\n\nEdit: just want to add as I see some people using she/her for me, I am a boy.

Second, you explained without going into detail multiple times from the sounds of it. They are the ones that kept pushing the issue until you were left with little choice but to educate them or deal with their BS the rest of the night. I say kudos to you for saving yourself the grief.", "NTA.  If you'd just offered up the info without provocation, then yes that would have been an assholio move.  But considering Beth kept harping on you about it and was starting to get other girls at the sleepover to agree with her, it was time for some education on what 'sucking it up' looks like for you.\n\nAlso, I hate when people get fussy about food allergies and intolerances.  It costs $0 to not be an asshole about other people's dietary needs.", "NTA. I have little patience for people who, after being told that someone has a food sensitivity, seem to not hear that information. You clarified a number of times, and had all the right to go nuclear. Everyone knew Beth was being a jerk; she ruined the mood, if anyone did. I\u2019m sure the rest of them were probably just annoyed at the dynamic Beth created with her food nagging. Food is very personal and people need to STFU about other people\u2019s food choices, allergies or otherwise. \n\nI was waiting to read that she switched the foods just to make you eat gluten and was relieved that did not happen. You handle yourself most appropriately OP, and Jane sounds like a good friend too.", "NTA. Beth should've\n 1. Kept her mouth shut. It was Jane's party, and if Jane and you already sorted things, it's not Beth's business.\n2. Once Jane said she was OK with it, and Beth kept on, she said it wouldn't kill you to suck it up and eat it for one night. You explained it was an ALLERGY. That's when Beth should have stopped as well. The fact that she got others to join in and agree that you should suck it up is peer pressure, and not fair to you or Jane. \n3. You did handle the explanation with gross detail, but sometimes that's what is needed.  In addition, allergic reactions can grow worse over time and repeated exposure. I'm allergic to a bunch of food items and have increasingly bad reactions when I eat them, so it's definitely something you CAN die from. Beth's snarky little comment, \"It won't kill you...\" is something I've already snapped back to with, \"Actually yes, it CAN kill me because eating something  I have an allergy to is like poisoning me!\"\n\nAs for feeling like an asshole because it was Jane's party? Didn't she already tell you she was all good with how things played out?  Give yourself a break, and next time, tell them, \"So, you dislike me enough to wish that I die from an allergy?\"  It's amazing how fast they shut up!", "NTA. My wife is also sensitive to gluten, although it sounds like not as severely as you. She's had a restaurant serve her a meal before that was marked GF but contained gluten. She felt different almost immediately and paid for it for several days after. Sounds like your friend who actually made the food was understanding, and \"Beth\" is just a sh*tty person. Don't spend any more mental or emotional energy on what \"Beth\" thinks about anything.", "NTA. Instead of Beth understanding you have an allergy she decided to throw a fit.

You have every right to keep yourself safe and had made these arrangements WITH the host of the party. The other friends can understand or mind their own business. You handled everything as well as you could handle it given the situation.", "NTA. The only opinion that should matter was Jane\u2019s opinion. It was her party and she said yes to your compromise so you could join the party. Everyone else is irrelevant and all the girls suck for being judgmental and not understanding until you went into details. That\u2019s on them and not on you.", "NTA \n\nPeople's diets are extremely personal and private. It is no one else's business what you put in there.\n\nNo, I don't think it's rude to bring your own food if you have dietary restrictions, I think it would be rude to expect someone to cater to your dietary needs.\n\nWith that being said and with no judgment on your friends part, for me personally, I actually feel it's rude not to at least attempt to cater to a person's diet when they are a guest in your home. I also know from personal experience how expensive and sometimes difficult it is to properly prepare a gluten free meal.\n\nThe idea of courtsey bites is ridiculous to me. I'm convinced it's a concept thought up by narracists to try and emotionally manipulate people in to eating their food.\n\nHer friend was being a huge asshole, ultimately what you did had no effect on anyone, it's insignificant. On the other hand, asshole complaining kinda ruined the vibe of the party.", "NTA.  Jane understood and she's the only that would have needed an apology if she had wanted one.

But all those little bits of gluten add up and are destroying things over time. So what might not be happening on the outside sure is going on inside.

Why would you start to go \"But if they eat it anyway..\"", "While I applaud your desire to cater to a person's diet, Gluten is incredibly succepable to cross contamination to the point that you don't want to use a wooden spoon that's been washed if it has been in contact with something that has gluten.\n\nMy point being, be very careful preparing gluten free food for your guests if you don't have experience with the prep work needed to prevent cross contamination.\n\nTHis has been your unsolicited advice for today.", "Came here to say this!   Also, OP Jane is 100% correct, you didn't ruin the night that any ruining of the night was caused by the others there.  You are NTA", "Yep. We are all team Jane here.", "Also came here to say. And you are NTA!", "I was waiting to read that she switched the foods just to make you eat gluten and was relieved that did not happen.", "Ah. I think I see where I could have created a misunderstanding. I use \u201csensitivity\u201d for the food allergy that doesn\u2019t kill me or put me in hospital. I have a seafood allergy/sensitivity (scallops specifically - can make me have terrific abdominal discomfort where I\u2019m in the bathroom for hours with distress in multiple directions.) Is an allergy. Will not kill me. I can eat them in small amounts with no ill result. If I use the word \u201callergy\u201d people assume I will go into anaphylactic shock and die. So I sometimes have to get a little more specific with my symptoms for those who won\u2019t drop the subject. Food sensitivities can be real, and are no ones business unless we make other people cook/buy food for us.", "OP is NTA, but you certainly are a giant asshole.", "Right?!? I have a serious allergy to alcohol.  Like, I carry and epipen and have gone into anaphylatic shock before and been rushed to an emergency room.  I /still/ get people who tell me they don't think there's any such thing as an alcohol allergy and try to sneak it into my drinks and food hoping for a gotcha moment.", "Absolutely. My dad died because his heart and kidney both just gave up. It turned out to be the impact of life long undiagnosed coeliac disease (he was 70).", "Fellow Celiac here... Have you tried the new GF Cauliflower Crusts? They've semi saved pizza for me!\n\nAnyone who doesn't need to travel constantly with Imodium in case of cross contamination gets zero input on my dietary choices. OP kept it together FAR better than I would have at His age!", "Celiac is an autoimmune disease, not an intolerance.", "Tbf I've never heard of that either, BUT if someone says that they have an allergy to something, then why would I not believe that? Why would anyone assume that people are lying about their allergy? Especially when you don't even know that person.\n\n>and try to sneak it into my drinks and food hoping for a gotcha moment.\n\nThat's also something I'll never understand. There are 2 possible outcomes here: 1) You're right and get your small \"gotcha\" moment. Amazing. 2) The person didn't lie and you've now caused a life-threatening situation for them.\n\nLike.. even if I actually believed that someone was lying, why would I take that risk just to prove them wrong? Even if there's a 95% chance that they're lying, _the stakes are way too high_. You're risking a potential fatal outcome for.. what? 5 minutes of being smug about exposing someone? Wow.", "Geez I am so sorry.  It takes forever for some people to get diagnosed with celiac. It\u2019s just not on a lot of doctors radars because symptoms vary and mimic so many other diseases.", "It\u2019s both. All allergies, intolerances, and sensitivities are the result of the body\u2019s immune system attacking itself in response to a stimulus.", "There is also no 'pill' to take so no big drug companies are down for medical education on it.  \n\nOP is very charitable and polite in her treatment of Beth.  I, personally, would have wolfed down the pizza and then, when the nausea and \\*projectile vomiting occurred, I would have made sure to hit her with it. \n\n(\\*my own symptoms with just a little bit of gluten.)", "Based off the limited description it sounds like op has food intolerances and not an allergy or celiacs disease.\n\nAllergies would be an autoimmune response like hives or anaphylaxis \n\nCeliacs disease is a complicated gi disease where the small intestines cells become damaged affecting bioavailability and nutrition absorption.\n\nFood Intolerances cause GI distress and will lead to vomiting, pain, and diarrhea.\n\nThe Gluten intolerance can be quite severe. From first hand experience, I\u2019ve projectile vomited and have soiled my pants before. It\u2019s quite embarrassing and people\u2019s reactions aren\u2019t kind.", "I hope you left a review about it online."]}
