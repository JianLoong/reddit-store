{"id": 2081, "submission_id": "ysmiqv", "title": "AITA for asking my friend to stop talking about what she does with her boyfriend", "selftext": "I (20F) have a friend (20F) who has been dating this guy recently. It's her first boyfriend, so she's really excited and talks a lot about him. Though I do sometimes find it a little bit annoying as he is now pretty much the center of our conversations, I'm just glad she's happy, so I still listen to her and get interested.\n\nIt really started bothering me once she told me they had done *IT* for the first time. Once again, she wad really excited and said it was an amazing experience. Since then, she started often telling me about her bedroom life, sometimes going into details.\n\nHere's the problem : I'm asexual. Not like the type of asexual who is sex positive, but the hard-core type who wants nothing to do with any of that. My friend does know that of course. The topic of sex in general just makes me uncomfortable. At first, I tried being nice and I still listened to her. But at some point, it just got too much. \n\nOne day, I just asked her if she could avoid talking about her bedroom life as it made me feel uncomfortable since I'm ace. She just got really hurt, telling me that we were best friends and that she should be able to talk about it with me. She also said that I was a bit selfish and that I needed to grow up and stop acting like a child (referencing to my asexuality). Then she started ranting about how anyways it was obvious I disliked her boyfriend because I never talked to him (it's not the case, her boyfriend is cool, I'm just a very quiet person). Now she's still talking to me but it's just very cold between the 2 of us. I don't know if she's right and if I should have made more efforts.\n\nSummary : my friend always talks in details about her bedroom life, and now she's mad at me because I asked her to stop doing that since it made me uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, I apologise if I made any mistake as English isn't my main language.\n\nEDIT : thank you all for your answers. I'm kind of relieved to see that most people also think that sex is something rather private. Since it really isn't part of my life, I'm not sure what is appropriate to talk about or not, so I just assumed that non asexual people enjoyed talking about it and that I was the one being rude or overreacting lol. I also see some people telling me to dump her. It's not really something that I want to do (we went through a lot together) but I'll definitely need to have a discussion with her, as I know realize that what she said really sucked.", "created_utc": 1668199433, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ysmiqv/aita_for_asking_my_friend_to_stop_talking_about/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even highly sexual people can find other people talking about their private sex lives incredibly uncomfortable. Your friend needs a different friend to talk to about this. I think you handled it very well, it doesn't read like you shamed her and were gentle. I don't know if your friendship can come back from this even if you want it back to normal. She doesn't respect you.", "NTA\n\n> She just got really hurt, telling me that we were best friends and that she should be able to talk about it with me.\n\nThis is not the behavior of an actual friend.", "NTA. Your friend is not respecting your clear boundaries and is purposely making you uncomfortable. This could be considered sexual harassment, since the unwanted sexual conversations have continued after you asked her to stop.", "NTA\n\neven if you weren't asexual, not everyone is interested in hearing about other's sex lives. And we get, it's new to her so she wants to share bc she's your best friend. but friends respect each other's limits also", "NTA. She's completely disregarding your boundaries in favor of her own preferences. It also sounds like she's disparaging your sexual preference. You're not ace because of a lack of maturity or experience; you're ace for the same reason she's attracted to men. She's being a bad friend", "NTA.  You aren't comfortable with discussing those details.  If she was a decent friend, she'd accept that and move on.", "NTA. Your friend needs to realize that people generally don't want to hear intimate details of their sex life.", "NTA. Your \u201cfriend\u201d is terribly inconsiderate", "NTA. You being asexual shouldn't even matter. Not everyone wants to discuss details of other people's sex activity with them. Your friend is the AH for not respecting your boundaries.", "NTA. I've known my closest friend for over 30 years and we don't discuss the details of our sex lives. I think the only time we did was when we found out we'd both briefly dated the same guy and he was an AH to both of us. We were 17 and we were using it as a catharsis for the way he'd treated us. If she starts telling other people the nitty gritty of her sex life, she'll soon find out that most people don't like hearing that stuff. It's called a private life for a reason. And I bet he'd be really bothered by her discussing it too.", "NTA I'm not even ace but I don't want a play by play of people's bedroom stuff. Sometimes in private conversation it can turn to that but not in some weird over sharing way. You have every right to set that boundary", "NTA. She wants you to just listen to her talk without regard to your feelings about it. Trust me, even folks who are very much into sex don't want to hear the details of someone else's sexual experiences.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to sit there and listen to everything she says about her relationship with her BF just because you're friends. It's understandable she's excited about it, him being her first BF and all, but she's overdoing it and you've expressed your discomfort. She should have dropped it.\n\nShe's wrong for then going on to make an issue out of it the way she did.", "Your friend has really poor boundaries of her own, and is disrespectful of yours as well. No one should be forced to listen to something they've clearly said they don't want to hear. She's the one who is acting immature. \n\n\"Hey friend, I've asked you to stop talking about your sex life. If you continue to do so, I will ask you again to stop and if you can't or won't, I will leave.\"\n\nNTA", "NTA. You shouldn't have to talk about her sex life if you don't want to. End of story.", "NTA\nFirst off good for you for creating boundaries with someone you consider your best friend, some people have issues with that.\n\nSecond, if it's something that makes you uncomfortable then your friend should acknowledge that. You can't change your sexuality and a best friend should acknowledge and accept that instead of claiming you should \"grow up\"\n\nThird, some people are generally uncomfortable with people talking about intimate things like that.\n\nLastly, keep setting boundaries. They are healthy is any type of relationship and if your friend can't accept the boundaries you place then hopefully one day you'll have friends that do.", "Honestly I'm nearly leaning towards NAH but she was rude for telling you're a child.

One funny sex story about an unnamed ex, I could tolerate but other than that, it's not something people engage on the daily with their friends.", "\"She also said that I was a bit selfish and that I needed to grow up and stop acting like a child (referencing to my asexuality).\" : wow. So she's shaming your sexual orientation. She's denying the existence of assexuality, as for her it's only being stuck in childhood. I bet she's got problem with any non heterosexual sexuality. In my opinion, she torture you with her sexual life on purpose, as a kind of conversion therapy. That's super toxic . That's unacceptable. And she gazlight you with her bullsh\\*t about friendship. Run !", "NTA", "NTA. If you are uncomfortable, she should respect your boundaries.", "NTA.  And listen to her.

So wrong on so many levels. Not to mention, I can't imagine, sharing *any* kind of important personal experience with someone if I very well know they will be uncomfortable and disgusted by it, even if (or more like especially if) that someone is my best friend.\n\nGive her some time to cool off, she's very caught up in her sexual exploration and new found love, and can't seem to think about anything else.

Its a no no to throw your sexual life on the face of your friend. Its not only inappropriate, but socially dangerous. You can talk about anything, but the implicit deal is one makes a confidence, then the other has to reciprocate at a moment. And it begins by soft confidences. Then it can go (really) more graphic but everyone has to feed the conversation at the same level of graphicness. That's the way you check you can built the trust.  And this is super important as even in 2022 slutshaming is a concrete risk for women.", "Exactly, why does she feel the need to tell you about her bedroom stuff"]}
