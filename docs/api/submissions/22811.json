What would that have changed? Your ex would still be mad because you went on the trip regardless of what you were doing. I'd just ignore her. She'll get over it in time and if she doesn't, well, that's no longer your problem. NTA", "u/SpiritedLettuce6900 is out here doing god's work. That's at least the third bot I've seen you call out today. I always try to do the same, but it seems there has been way more copied comments recently than normal.", "Yea, that definitely answered my question, thanks a lot! :) \n\nFor sure, one thing can be fitting even when something else would fit better. \\^\\^", "NTA. I hope you had a great time! Sucks to be her.", "NTA!

For her to be upset at you is unbelievable entitlement.  Also, fucking hilarious.  NTA.", "NTA, she left you. I would've tagged her in every photo but that's me lol", "Maybe recommend she makes a career change to vacation planning. Sounds like she is good at it!

My college boyfriend was planning to spend a semester abroad in Africa, I was considering going with him. He cheated on me, we broke up, and I still went to Africa - without him.

Glad you had a great time.", "\\> I just thought it would be a waste to let all that planning not be used\n\nOP thinks his ex's travel planning was valuable since \"it would be a waste\" not to use it. I'm not condoning or forgiving her actions, but one act of infidelity does not mean that her time is worthless or it was ok for OP to inflict emotional damage in response. Maybe I'm in the wrong here but my gut reaction is \"I would not want to be friends with OP.\" I wouldn't want to be friends with his ex.\n\nI'm willing to listen to an explanation of why I'm wrong.", "Why wouldn't it be OK for him to inflict emotional damage in response to her infidelity?

You paid for the trip after the breakup, that she even spoke to you about it is ridiculous.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but it is a perfect example of how womens labor benefits men and men are happy to take what you give without any thought or alnowledgement of your labor.  I wonder if OP told the woman he took about the original intent of the trip, a generous gift for a woman he wanted to propose to, and that she had actually planned all the details of the trip.

The ex's jealousy also isn't a healthy response. They're both absolutely understandable but neither reaction was nice.
