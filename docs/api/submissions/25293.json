Just \"Call Uncle X Anna now. Call her she.\"  \nThis evening Anna came over to pick up some tomatoes from my garden (we have a lot of tomatoes at the moment). She asked if she could speak to me alone. She said she had noticed the kids weren't calling her Aunt Anna. I acknowledged they were not. She asked if that was because I didn't see her as a woman. I said I had simply instructed them to call her the name she chose because I didn't want to make it even more confusing. She then asked point blank if I \"see\" her as a woman. I told her the truth: I do not think she falls under my definition of a woman, but I understand she falls under her definition of a woman. I will call her by her chosen name and pronouns, but no, I do not believe she is a woman. She became furious and stormed out. Now my mother (who agrees with me mind you) wants me to apologize.  \nI am really trying to figure out what I did wrong here. I never said anything to her until asked directly.

This is because it\u2019s not appropriate to experiment on human beings, and animal models cannot replicate a uniquely human experience like the inward perception of gender.

It\u2019s not a mental disorder - that would mean that something were \u201cwrong\u201d and required \u201cfixing\u201d.

It muddies the waters in an already highly fraught area.   \n\nThe truth is in itself enough.   There is nothing medically wrong with people who are transgender.  We do not yet know *why* transgender people are transgender, but we know that they exist.   Because there is nothing medically wrong with them, they do not require \u201ctreatment\u201d and do not need to be \u201ccured\u201d.   They are simply human, simply people.   A subset of humanity.   Until more retroactive studies come in (which will take another 10-20 years) that is all we can really say with scientific certainty.  \n\nTransgender people are people.
