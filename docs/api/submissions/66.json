Before two nights before leaving my chihuahua puppy (9 months, my little baby boy who I utterly adored and loved) started throwing up occasionally.

On the week long trip my bf and I go, he is meanwhile telling me not to worry, that it literally helps nothing to worry, so I try to push my worry down)\n\nMy puppy did get worse, my parents did take him to the vet. He had surgery to remove a blockage in his intestines. He didn't wake from the anesthesia.\n\nMy parents didn't know whether to call me on my trip or not, I had asked them to keep me posted, and so they did end up deciding to call me and tell me (this was on day 3 or day 4? Of our 7 day trip).\n\nI was heartbroken. Like really heartbroken.  My bf was not attached to our/My dog like I was. He tried to be supportive the first day after, the evening of the second day after came around and he got mad at me for my bad mood, saying I was ruining our expensive trip, he couldn't understand why I couldn't simply enjoy where we were and place my mourning on hold for a few more days until we got home. (We are from northern Canada, long cold winters, granted we value our hot vacays away when we can take them).\n\nShould I have tried harder to keep a grip, grit a smile, have fun in the moment and mourn the loss of my dog once I was back home? AITA that ruined our trip?\n\nMore information: \n- the trip was an expensive trip for both of us, extra expensive for my partner as we last minute upgraded to a nicer/ bigger room\n- my partner lives sober and only allows himself to drink out of country.

And it\u2019s worrying that you\u2019re even asking if you\u2019re the asshole for\u2026 what? Not suppressing your grief and painting on a smile for the sake of your shallow controlling boyfriend? \n\nYour boyfriend is a colossal asshole who lacks empathy and only wants you when you are happy and fun. He doesn\u2019t see you as whole person, just an accessory that exists to make his life more enjoyable. He doesn\u2019t need to have had a personal relationship with your dog to understand how losing him might have made you feel.

And sadly I feel like I might be sorrier than your (hopefully soon to be ex) boyfriend.", "NTA - I\u2019m sorry for your loss first of all. But no one can blame you for your grief, your boyfriend should have been more compassionate.", "Huh? Your pet died and he cares about a good time being ruined? Would he expect the same if a friend/family member died?? That's how pets are as well.\n\nWhy are you with someone who lacks such empathy????\n\nNTA at all.", "Is everyone going to ignore the massive age gap or??? \nLike, girl. That's a massive red flag to begin with. Then this happens. He obviously doesn't love or respect you to be treating you like this. He's older and has more money than you, and he uses this to try and control you. You need to get out, like yesterday. Holy shit.", "NTA, obviously. \n\nThis kind of self-centredness is why your boyfriend hasn't got a 42 year old girlfriend, though.", ">*\u2026he got mad at me for my bad mood,* ***saying I was ruining our expensive trip***, he couldn't understand why I couldn't simply enjoy where we were and ***place my mourning on hold*** *for a few more days until we got home.*\n\nYour boyfriend seriously lacks empathy. **He got mad at you because you were upset your dog died.** I don't know how long you've been together, but this can't be the first time nor will it be the last when you need his support and he thinks only of himself.\n\nCondolences on the loss of your sweet pup.\n\nNTA but you will be to yourself if you stay with this guy.", "NTA. So a family member died and he wants you to \u201cput your mourning on hold\u201d? That is like a sociopathic level of lacking empathy. Sorry your human emotions got in the way of his vacation. I would seriously be questioning a relationship with such a person. Even if he didn\u2019t care about someone that died, pet or person, the fact is that YOU care and he should be respectful and supportive of that.", "NTA. My husband is not a dog person. We / I have 2 very large dogs whom I adore and love and dote on. If this was us, I\u2019d be devastated and would have booked it back home already and my husband would understand and would be with me every step.\n\nYour bf is a huge insensitive asshole. My husband\u2019s uncle passed when we were on vacation in Europe. Instead of a loud trip, partying etc like we planned, we turned the trip into a quiet one. Had really nice dinners, did more exploring, swapped the louder activities with quieter ones. The trip was still enjoyable and I appreciated that we got to experience the country and culture more that way.\n\nMost of all, I respected my husband need to grieve and slow down our plans.", "NTA\n\nBut why are you with this person? He is 15 years older than you and apparently treats you like you aren't allowed to have feelings? You're dating a guy more than twice your age and please correct me if I've read this wrong, but it seems he cares more about faffing about in the kink community (which by itself is fine) than the relationship with his PARTNER. \n\nThe community is about communication, support, and mutual consent. He's a disgrace.", "Woman, get the hell out of this relationship. Even without the age gap, you just lost your pet and he's saying you're 'ruining' the trip because of your grief???", "NTA. Possibly the parents should have been told not to tell you but you would have been wondering and would have felt guilty after. \n\nI\u2019m sorry about your pup.", "NTA. It sounds like you do recognize that you should have brought your dog to the vet, so I'm just going to leave it at that.", "NAH\n\nI understand how you feel, because the last time I had a pet pass away, I had to take like a week off work. I was a real mess and I still get weepy thinking of that damn cat.\n\nI understand how your boyfriend feels too, a trip like that requires time, money and energy. I think it's fair for him to be upset about this as well. \n\nYour parents did what you asked them to, but if I was being honest, I wouldn't have told you about it until you got home.

Ask yourself why a man his age would be acting so immature. Really weird guy.", "YTA. As you said, you are definitely the AH for not taking your \"little baby boy\" to the vet yourself and instead just waiting until your parents could do it for you. For it to be so serious that he needed flipping surgery when he went in just days after it started, you neglected him. Never have human children.", "> Your boyfriend is a colossal asshole who lacks empathy and only wants you when you are happy and fun. He doesn\u2019t see you as whole person, just an accessory that exists to make his life more enjoyable.\n\nSounds exactly like my ex husband. He was always annoyed with me when I wasn't all smiles. I didn't even have to be sad or upset in any way, if I didn't seem to be deliriously happy then he complained about the lack of smiling.\n\nWhy? Because if I wasn't happy then he had to deal with whatever I was feeling (never asked him to) and that was bringing his mood down. So I was basically being selfish if I didn't constantly smile while around him.", "100%.

The idea of an age gap being what is causing an issue seems silly as someone who's parents are still together and worked through issues related to any age stuff.\n\nI do think him being awful is a reason to get away, especially if not compatible with you wanting pets and him not caring about them/not wanting any.

It sounds like your bf was really excited about this trip (the last minute upgrade) and like he probably needed it (the trip was meant to allow you guys to let loose). It makes perfect sense that he would be frustrated and upset that it\u2019s ruined, it\u2019s just important to realize that he\u2019s not necessarily upset with you but the situation in general. You can\u2019t make your emotions disappear and it makes perfect sense that you\u2019d be heart broken and that\u2019s not your fault. Sometimes bad things happen and nobodies the asshole, it\u2019s just a terrible situation.", "you don't really understand how foreign bodies work. vomiting can be caused by a lot of things, it usually takes most owners a few days to realize something is seriously wrong. most foreign body surgeries are extremely sucessful and the animal recovers well. ops dog was one of the unfortunate few to end up not waking up from anesthesia, which likely didn't have anything to do with how successful the surgery itself was. this is tragic and op deserves sympathy and support at this time", "*WHOAAAAAA*\n\nThis is so fucking uncalled for. Rude, venomous, and devoid of any empathy.\n\nYou're not living in reality.", "He told her SHE RUINED THE TRIP like it was her fault there was a sudden tragedy. He was super excited, so it's okay for him to be a total dick?\n\nRight. \ud83d\ude44", "I didn't see where it said anything about that being the cause of the blockage. Wouldn't that also mean the puppy ate something it shouldn't without OP even noticing?", "Yah, it's *understandable* that he was upset his trip was ruined and it's *understandable* that he might selfishly take it out on her. It's *understandable* but he's still an asshole.", "a foreign body and a blockage are the same thing. things don't usually get stuck in the intestines unless they're something the dog shouldn't have eaten \n\nand yeah, it does mean that, but no one is perfect and puppies can get into all kinds of stuff. it's bad luck and it sucks but it does not mean someone is a bad owner. she was clearly willing to pay for the surgery and medical care.  usually surgeries like that run at least 1k, at an emergency vet closer to 3-8k depending. and op still would have had to pay that despite her baby not making it. \n\nit's tragic and it sucks and its no one's fault. hindsight is 20/20 but we can't all be perfect all the time. once op and her parents realized something was wrong they took all the correct steps. it's no one's fault that luck was not on their side", "What? He said to \"place my mourning on hold for a few more days\"? That is truly heartless and shows he doesn't care about your feelings at all. \n\nNTA."]}
