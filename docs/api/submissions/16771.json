But I have seen the way some childfree folks act and it is insane. I get expressing annoyance but I've seen really messed up things said about kids and some really concerning opinions. \n\nIn terms of flying, what do these people want parents to do? A lot of the time flying is the only mode of transport. \n\nIt doesn't even end there. I've seen some vile things said about parents (particularly mothers) who have children which I'm not even going to touch. People who make their entire personality about being anti-children tend to be insufferable.\n\nNTA for calling out their hate. Its not healthy.", "Ehh hard to say. Being so pro-child myself, I would say NTA for shutting down their ridiculous views on mothers not being able to bring their children out in public. \n\nHowever, I (not part of the queer community) do agree that their views are different than that of homophobia. ..I see the point you\u2019re trying to make but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that comparable.", "NTA and bravo", "YTA, it is bad comparison and even a worse hill to die on, talking about dieing has anyone inflicted violence on a kid for a thing it can't change? \n\nAre their places in the world were kids are hunted down like a disease? \n\nIt's a very bad comparison, I have nothing agents kids but I still agreed that in some places they should be banned simply because they dony have the maturity to be there, none of the gay people I know would runn around yelling and knocking things over but if they did they would probably also not be welcomed at this places.", "ESH. Demanding that kids be excluded from public is an asshole opinion, but you really shouldn't try to compare bigotries, especially in cases like this where one has the power of government and large parts of society behind it and the other is a fringe opinion that at worst makes the majority group feel uncomfortable. Take a moment to think about the typical gay person's experience with homophobia and then think about the worst thing a parent could experience from anti-child advocates.", "ESH every person in this story sounds insufferable and like an absolute shit to be around. Ironically if you were in a restaurant having this pissing match it would've been sweet justice if you all got kicked out.", "YTA. There's loads of people who want to take this stuff too far, planes are a big one, but you cant seriously think adult only places is akin to homophobia?? There's loads of places that do that already, bars and clubs being the obvious one, but adult only classes, adult only meetups and so on... if Davids suggestion is a \"call to persecution\" then all of the above is literally persecution. Adults and kids having different spaces sometimes is not oppression. I agree with you that restaurants and planes is too much but that doesnt make it persecution.", "YTA", "I'm going with NTA on this one. You're well within your rights to call out hateful speech when you hear it- and anti-child rhetoric of that type is very hateful speech indeed especially since it effectively insinuates that anyone who isn't a fully functional adult doesn't belong in regular society at all, ever, which is harmful rhetoric that can (and has) been applied to people with disabilities and other vulnerable minorities for decades. I don't know that homophobia is the exact comparison I'd have used but I think it's an effective way of pointing out why this sort of language needs to stop being tolerated.", "YTA\n\nA screaming child in a plane IS my problem. (Autism with significant auditory sensory issues).  Someone else's actions are directly causing me physical pain and distress. \n\n,Lesbian couple doing.... Subaru things doesn't effect my life in any way. It's a garbage comparison.", "NTA, I think the comparison isn't 1 to 1. Kids are manifestefly different from adults in behaviour, responsability capacity, cognitive maturity etc, in ways that aren't analogous to homosexuals contra heterosexuals. \n\nWith that said, I think you bring a good point of raising \"when is it okay to say I hate group x\" and your friends could have disagreed politely and offered their opinion without calling you an AH.", "Not really an asshole. \n\n\n\nBUT.

I hate kids too so i might be biased, but being upset at some asshole kid screaming or yoinking my stuff and having a blaah parent not deal with it is not the same as gay people getting murdered or harassed.\n\nWanting childfree zones isn't bigotry. It's like asking loud people not to talk in theatres. Difference being kids don't have the mental fortitude to understand shut up.", "NTA. Bigotry is the worst.", "NTA\n\nNice one for calling them out on their bullshit.  \n\nI have kids.  They are my responsibility and I have done my best over the years to make sure they don't get on other peoples nerves.  The thing is they are kids and you can't get it right all the time.  Some parents though don't seem to care and will let their kids go feral and this really does ruin things for everyone around at the time.  \n\nThe most normal issue I come across though is entitled grownups who think the world revolves around them.  They tend to be the ones causing the problems rather than any kids.\n\nThere are also plenty of adult only spaces people can use but your friends can't have everything.  Many places are family friendly because its a huge market businesses want to tap into.", "NTA. Apartheid for children shouldn't be attractive to anyone. The worst behaviour I've seen on planes has been from adults. Pubs, clubs and bars don't have children in them but you really aren't guaranteed to have a calm, civilised experience when you go there.", "You're not TA at all...you made a legitimate example. Kids are the most vulnerable people on earth so how is it not valid? They're often victims of adult crime, negligence and abuse. Their brains are under-developed and they literally don't have the capacity to stop certain behaviours like adults do (but often don't...)\n\nSo now it's *cool* to hate kids...but not cool to hate any other group? Why? I understand not wanting to have kids and I also understand not being drawn to children...but hate? That's like saying...well, I don't want to be gay. I'm not drawn to gay people...so I've decided to hate all gay people, begrudge their existence and their place in society and public places. Why can't they just stay home? Why do I have to see them being gay? Can't they tone down their gayness and act straight so I can be more comfortable?", "NTA. Interesting comparison. We all can complain from time to time, but this sounds like too much. There is a line when it comes to complaining about children. If a child is running around a restaurant and parents aren't doing anything about it, or they're brought to a movie at an inconsiderate time, sure that's fine to complain. But, even though it's annoying, it's not fair to complain about a baby crying on a plane. I doubt the parents want the child to cry. \n\nPeople who hate children are big red flags. I also want to know how these people acted as children. I doubt they were all angels.", "NTA for saying what they were saying is wrong but kinda YTA for comparing it to homophobia.", "NTA.

Children are human beings and any discrimination towards another human being based on age or ethnicity or language or gender or sexual orientation or skin color or ability or religion or reproduction or whatever is not okay.   \nDiscrimination is discrimination no matter what label it goes under and it\u2019s all abhorrent. It\u2019s abhorrent to you because you are a genuinely good human being who hates injustice.   \nIt\u2019s bizarre to me that people discriminate against children and those that have children , seeing as we were all children with parents ourselves at some point.

I have dealt with homophobia. My own grandmother said I was dead to her after coming out at 19 and I have no contact with multiple other family members because of who I am. Trust me when I say that I think about the typical gay person's experience with homophobia. Is it as bad? I don't know, I am not a parent and likely never will be.

The opinion, however, was that there should be whole child-free zones as in full zones in cities if not whole cities themselves and not just certain spaces.

Or can come up with ways to sooth ourselves, which has taken time for me and is not always a perfect process, admittedly. And I am sure that we both would not curse out a baby for just existing or doing things natural for their existence, like crying.
