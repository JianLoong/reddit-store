You're well within your rights to call out hateful speech when you hear it- and anti-child rhetoric of that type is very hateful speech indeed especially since it effectively insinuates that anyone who isn't a fully functional adult doesn't belong in regular society at all, ever, which is harmful rhetoric that can (and has) been applied to people with disabilities and other vulnerable minorities for decades.

Why do I have to see them being gay? Can't they tone down their gayness and act straight so I can be more comfortable?", "NTA. Interesting comparison. We all can complain from time to time, but this sounds like too much. There is a line when it comes to complaining about children. If a child is running around a restaurant and parents aren't doing anything about it, or they're brought to a movie at an inconsiderate time, sure that's fine to complain. But, even though it's annoying, it's not fair to complain about a baby crying on a plane. I doubt the parents want the child to cry. \n\nPeople who hate children are big red flags.

Are the kids really that awful?", "because one is actually legally persecuted and the other is not. it's the same with making jokes about white ppl vs poc -- if you're white, these jokes don't actually impact your life. no one is passing discriminatory laws against white ppl, or trynna take white ppls rights away, or killing white ppl just bc they're white. \"anti whiteness\" is not a systemic issue in the same way anti blackness/racism is. whereas if a white person were to make jokes where poc are the \"butt\" of the joke, ie a \"punch down,\" that wouldn't be ok. there is actually a line that can be drawn, and jokes about a persecuted group vs a non persecuted group can be differentiated between.\n\nOP, i saw in another comment you said you were autistic and i might be making ableist assumptions but i'm willing to bet that this was a case of them joking and you not being able to tell, as well as a case of you having a \"rule\" and them apparently \"breaking the rule.\" like, i am 99% sure they were not actually advocating for the law to change to ban children from airplanes and other public spaces. that is genuinely insane. however, it's very common for people to say they hate kids and don't want kids in public spaces as a form of *hyperbole.* they are expressing their dislike of loud noises and interruptions that children oftentimes cause through hyperbole and dark humor. i have made these jokes before, saying straight faced that i wanted to drop kick a baby across the room. of course i didn't mean it. i used dark humor to make light of something i found annoying (the crying baby) so that i wouldn't be as annoyed by it, since i was able to laugh at it. this is very, very common. like, it's fun to hate on children as a concept with your friends! but when push comes to shove, they wouldn't *actually* act in hateful ways or support hateful rules/policies, ya know? it can be hard to tell because people seem so serious while saying it, but the expectation is that everyone understands that it's hyperbole -- which can be difficult if you're autistic, or just don't catch sarcasm or social cues very well. i truly just think you misread the situation here.\n\nas for the rule breaking: it seems like you believe that hating on a group for who they are when they haven't even directly harmed you is wrong, as a rule (paraphrased from one of your comments). and you're right! saying hateful things about anyone is wrong. being mean, or exclusionary, or judgmental towards any group simply bc they belong to that group is wrong, and ppl should strive to be kind without exception. but that's like, the gold standard. the most morally pure take. what perfection looks like, ya know? it's the Rule. but a very important thing about friendship is the ability to push boundaries by breaking rules like that and still be accepted. that's why friends like to tease each other -- if they don't take offense to your teasing, that proves that you have a close enough relationship to break social norms and have them still accept you. this makes people feel validated, safe, comfortable, and loved, which manifests through laughter or \"continuing the bit\" and teasing them back/adding to the joke. pushing boundaries and saying what would, in any other situation, be offensive or wrong does not mean that they actually mean what they say, it means that they feel safe enough to say it around you because they assume you have a close enough relationship to trust that they *dont* actually mean it. \n\nor example, i love to tease my friends and they love to tease me back. bullying each other is a love language because we all trust each other not to mean it and feel safe with each other. and of course everyone has boundaries and if they don't like being teased i'd respect that, and of course you should stand up to bullies, but what you did was less \"you shouldn't bully people\" (which is valid in a situation where bullying or genuine hatred is happening) and more \"you shouldn't say mean things or tease your friends ever/at all \ud83d\ude07.\" which comes off not only as you not getting the joke, but as you truly believing that they would be so vitriolic towards innocent children -- akin to them being homophobic. you basically called their character into question and said you don't trust them to be good people. and you did it in their safe space -- around their friends, who they felt safe being vulnerable and breaking social rules with -- too. in doing so, you showed them that their relationships with you aren't as close as they thought they were, which is hurtful and would make them more defensive/angry.\n\nnot to mention, excessive moral purity comes off as very condescending and judgmental, like you view yourself as better than them. i know it's a rule not to be hateful to any one/group, but it is ok to break that rule with friends in a joking manner, as i explained above. you will likely run into more problems in the future if you don't learn to differentiate between friendship joking/hyperbole and actual hatred. it might be helpful in the future to quietly ask the person you're closest to (physical proximity and/or relationship-wise) whether or not they're joking, because you can't tell if they actually believe what they're saying or if it's hyperbole. \n\ngently, YTA. not intentionally, and i don't hold your misunderstanding against each other. but the way you acted towards them was absolutely asshole-ish, and you should apologize to them for assuming the worst of them. also, homophobia is absolutely not a comparable issue (as i explained in my first paragraph) and i'm sure that you saying that is why your friends are so hurt. you rejected their friendship in the harshest way --  you basically equated them to their oppressors and called them bad people when they were being vulnerable and joking with people they thought were safe to joke around.", "Entire childfree cities would be a haven for many people with sensory and auditory processing disorder for example and im sure there are other disabilities aswell where this would be a wonderful option to have \n\nBeing inclusive to disabled people is not discrimination of another when the rest of the entire world is catered to families/children\n\nComparing it to homophobia is a joke, there are no universal laws against children, no one would ever advocate for that, its adding a few spots for people with other needs\n\nI would also advocate for cities that are 100% catered to a host of disabilities and abled people would have to adjust to the disabled, thats not discrimination either since the rest of the world is catered primarily to abled people\n\nThere should be no issue with making SOME flights childfree or only 12+ , same with some restaurants or certain times at restaurants\n\nThats actual inclusivity", "[removed]", "The challenge is that you're comparing a class of people who do not have full rights due to not having adult capability and are legitimately restricted from certain spaces (kids aren't allowed in nightclubs, sex clubs / brothels, certain movies, certain work spaces) with a class who were/are restricted due to illegitimate reasons. \n\nThat's not to say their actions are correct, but it's not the right comparison.\n\n(I am not that much older than you, but I remember LGBTQ+ spaces echoing with insults about 'breeders'.
