My god has it been rough, she is with us 50 percent of the time and when we she first moved in we had a whole conversation about how to make this as easy for everyone as possible. If I have an issue I will talk to my husband and he handles all the discipline. This is a double edge sword. She is as sweet as honey when her dad is there moment she gone she is an asshole.\n\nHer favorite thing for her to do at the moment is ruin my food. If I am cooking she will dump salt into the stew or other things. It\u2019s so frustrating and I haven\u2019t been able to catch her. My husband knows and asked about it but he won\u2019t discipline  her without proof. \n\nSo I set up a mini camera in the kitchen. Today I was making her cake (birthday in a week but was going to surprise her before she went back to her mom) I put them in the oven and she goes over, takes them out and dumps a ton of salt on top of it. I threw them out and told her that was her birthday cake and she\u2019s not getting a cake now from me. She goes to her father and tells him I messed up the cake and won\u2019t fix it for her.\n\nHe comes home pissed at me and I show him the video, he now even more pissed that filmed in the house even though this has been a problem for a while and he wouldn\u2019t do anything. Everyone is calling me a jerk and I don\u2019t know now. Should I just remake the cake .\n\nEdit/update: Now a bit after I posted my husband came up and apologized to me. He fears he will lose his kid if he is too strict.  He did go and talk to his daughter and parented. It was a long talk and she came out and apologized to me after.\n\nIt was long, and broke down to his ex. She took a picture of the cake after and I didn\u2019t think much of it in the video. Well her mom has been hounding her. She found it easier to cause me problem then tell her mom no. He is going to deal with his ex, he asked me to right a list everything I can remember her doing and we will go to a mediator.\n\nFor my stepdaughter she is grounded for a month and needs to cook 4 times a week for he family. She took this with grace so I think there is hope and want to give it a try before blowing up the marriage.", "created_utc": 1693312565, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/164hb6c/aita_for_throwing_away_my_stepdaughters_birthday/", "score": 719, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like he's angry he now has to deal with his daughter more than anything.", "NTA. She's 17, she's too old for this nonsense. Ruining a cake that someone was baking for you and then whining about the natural consequences of not having a cake is ridiculous behaviour for someone so close to being an adult. Your husband is the asshole encouraging this nonsense. He's free to bake a cake himself, if he thinks it's warranted. \n\nTurn the camera off and don't lift a finger to cook the next time she's in the house. Feed yourself only. They'll soon get the message.", "NTA\n\nThough honestly, why didn't you serve her and her father that cake? Might have made everything much more clear.\n\nAnd you don't have a step-daughter problem. You have have a husband problem. He knows. He just doesn't want to discipline her. Probably out of a misguided fear that she will hate him, when in reality she needs the discipline.\n\nWhy exactly are you with him?", "NTA.  Keep the camera on, serve her the food she ruins and show the video when she complains (no matter who's there). \"I thought you liked it that way. Here's you seasoning it to your taste.\"\n\n Make sure you cook a portion only for yourself and watch that food the entire time. I would have served her the cake.   And make plans to leave her dad. That's what she wants and he's always going to be blind to her actions.", "NTA. You could have handled it better: serve the cake and show the video in the meantime.\n\nI would divorce over this. Father and daughter are obviously not ready for a relationship with another person and this will cost you your sanity.", " NTA-She\u2019s more than old enough to learn the meaning of play stupid games earn stupid prizes.", "NTA, but it\u2019s not your step daughter that\u2019s the biggest problem here, it\u2019s your husband, walking red flag.", "You put up with this for 3yrs? Oh no no no", "You have a husband problem. Save your sanity and get the hell out of there.", "NTA.\n\nAnd you should absolutely NOT make another cake. \n\nShe is 17, and this behavior is unacceptable.  Your husband's response is also unacceptable. It sounds like you need professional help.\n\nAnother thought-- You could offer to instruct her on how to make the cake, and even stay with her in the kitchen.", "NTA- I was taught from a young age choices = consequences.\n\nShe CHOSE to ruin her own cake not knowing it was hers. Her CONSEQUENCE now is that she doesn't get a cake from you. At 17 years old, she should know better. Whether it was a joke or just outright being spoiled, it's still unacceptable if it has happened more than once.", "NTA\nGood on you for filming n busting her.\nBad on hubby for wanting proof n moaning when he gets it", "NTA, but I can also be petty. I would have served the cake and after doing so played the video of her dumping salt in it for everyone to see.", "NTA. Since her birthday is in a week and she is going to her mother's, her mother can bake her a cake. Stop baking and cooking for her! When she is there don't cook at all since her father doesn't have the balls to have a talk with her.\n\nIf she is 17 and her birthday is in a week, that will make her 18. 18 is considered an adult and she is much too old to be acting like this. She should be having conversations about what's bothering her. \n\nAnd by the way, your husband is an asshole.", "NTA. But you need to leave this man. His daughter is actively attacking your character, ruining your stuff and meddling in your relationship.\n\n I would have setup a camera to.

He\u2019s telling you that he will never have your back when it comes to his spoiled brat.", "You have a right to film in the house for evidence of malfeasance.  \n\nYou provided proof.  You are being blamed for providing proof.\n\nDo not remake the cake, and have a serious discussion iwht your husband.\n\nSD is trying to separate you two.\n\nIf you two can't be a united front, this is a disaster for your relationship.", "NTA. The real issue here is not your stepdaughter, but your husband. He's sending a loud and clear message to her that she can do whatever she wants and he's not going to have your back. Maybe he should hand you the reins on parenting responsibilities because he's not doing a very good job. She sounds awful. If I showed my husband proof that his kid was ruining food for our family out of spite and he scolded ME for it, I'd probably be filing for divorce. Let him make his AH daughter a cake. Let him do all the cooking from now on. He's earned it.", "NTA. Do not remake the cake. Think hard about your relationship with that man because when you have proof that his daughter is making you literally throw away food and wasting money and lied about it, his first reflex is to turn against you and be mad that you filmed it... after he said he would do nothing without proof.\n\nThis is a hill I'd be willing to die on, and by that I mean I'd heavily consider ending this relationship.", "No but you should get a divorce lawyer", "Sounds like you have a stepdaughter AND husband problem. She\u2019s a toxic little shit and her enables her. He knows she\u2019s doing these things to you and does nothing because \u201cno proof\u201d yet when you provide proof he has no problems shouting at you because how dare you prove his golden child is evil.  No matter what you do you are suffering all I gotta ask is the relationship really worth putting yourself through this?", "NTA.  Your husband is just pissed because he doesn't want to actually have to deal with his daughter.  You're in a no win situation here.  He is not going to do anything and his daughter is going to continue to terrorize you in his absence.", "NTA. \n\nHusband: I won't do anything as there is no evidence.\n\nYou: Sets up a way to get evidence.\n\nHusband: How dare you provide me with evidence.", "You should have decorated it and served it as it was. Natural consequences are the best ones. And you absolutely should not have cameras set up in the house without your partner being aware; that's a huge invasion of privacy. However, your partner essentially ignoring the situation is what set you up for this situation, so ESH.", "ESH. You get to family counseling. She\u2019s still a kid and you and your husband have not stood together in all that time. You need to figure this out.", "ESH.\n\nYour husband is right to be bothered you set up \\*cameras\\* in his home, too, without his consent. Heck, in some places that could be illegal, however him coming at you instead of just asking you for your take is a failure.\n\nDon't blame you for throwing out the cake and not remaking it; she doesn't deserve that. If your family is so F'd up you are comfortably spying like this tho, wow. Like, this was exactly how you destroy and possible trust; she may be horrible but she's \\*the child\\* and you need ot learn how to work with her and not against her. \n\nDaughter sucks for being so spiteful.\n\nY'all seriously have some work to do.", "ESH\n\nObviously the daughter shouldn't be acting out like this. But clearly she hasn't fully accepted/dealt with her parent's separation/divorce and you joining her life.\n\nHer dad is clearly not parenting very well if he's letting her get away with this.\n\nI think filming went a bit far. Maybe you should have mentioned to your husband and step-daughter that you were going to do this? I'd feel very uncomfortable with one of my family members setting up a camera in the house, too.\n\nTo be clear, I think you're the LEAST AH of the three, but ESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
