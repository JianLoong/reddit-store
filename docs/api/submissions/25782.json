My husband knows and asked about it but he won\u2019t discipline  her without proof. \n\nSo I set up a mini camera in the kitchen. Today I was making her cake (birthday in a week but was going to surprise her before she went back to her mom) I put them in the oven and she goes over, takes them out and dumps a ton of salt on top of it. I threw them out and told her that was her birthday cake and she\u2019s not getting a cake now from me. She goes to her father and tells him I messed up the cake and won\u2019t fix it for her.\n\nHe comes home pissed at me and I show him the video, he now even more pissed that filmed in the house even though this has been a problem for a while and he wouldn\u2019t do anything.

Sounds like he's angry he now has to deal with his daughter more than anything.", "NTA. She's 17, she's too old for this nonsense. Ruining a cake that someone was baking for you and then whining about the natural consequences of not having a cake is ridiculous behaviour for someone so close to being an adult. Your husband is the asshole encouraging this nonsense. He's free to bake a cake himself, if he thinks it's warranted. \n\nTurn the camera off and don't lift a finger to cook the next time she's in the house. Feed yourself only. They'll soon get the message.", "NTA\n\nThough honestly, why didn't you serve her and her father that cake? Might have made everything much more clear.\n\nAnd you don't have a step-daughter problem. You have have a husband problem. He knows. He just doesn't want to discipline her. Probably out of a misguided fear that she will hate him, when in reality she needs the discipline.\n\nWhy exactly are you with him?", "NTA.  Keep the camera on, serve her the food she ruins and show the video when she complains (no matter who's there). \"I thought you liked it that way. Here's you seasoning it to your taste.\"\n\n Make sure you cook a portion only for yourself and watch that food the entire time. I would have served her the cake.   And make plans to leave her dad. That's what she wants and he's always going to be blind to her actions.", "NTA. You could have handled it better: serve the cake and show the video in the meantime.\n\nI would divorce over this. Father and daughter are obviously not ready for a relationship with another person and this will cost you your sanity.", " NTA-She\u2019s more than old enough to learn the meaning of play stupid games earn stupid prizes.", "NTA, but it\u2019s not your step daughter that\u2019s the biggest problem here, it\u2019s your husband, walking red flag.", "You put up with this for 3yrs? Oh no no no", "You have a husband problem. Save your sanity and get the hell out of there.", "NTA.\n\nAnd you should absolutely NOT make another cake. \n\nShe is 17, and this behavior is unacceptable.  Your husband's response is also unacceptable. It sounds like you need professional help.\n\nAnother thought-- You could offer to instruct her on how to make the cake, and even stay with her in the kitchen.", "NTA- I was taught from a young age choices = consequences.\n\nShe CHOSE to ruin her own cake not knowing it was hers. Her CONSEQUENCE now is that she doesn't get a cake from you. At 17 years old, she should know better. Whether it was a joke or just outright being spoiled, it's still unacceptable if it has happened more than once.", "NTA\nGood on you for filming n busting her.\nBad on hubby for wanting proof n moaning when he gets it", "NTA, but I can also be petty. I would have served the cake and after doing so played the video of her dumping salt in it for everyone to see.", "NTA. Since her birthday is in a week and she is going to her mother's, her mother can bake her a cake. Stop baking and cooking for her! When she is there don't cook at all since her father doesn't have the balls to have a talk with her.\n\nIf she is 17 and her birthday is in a week, that will make her 18. 18 is considered an adult and she is much too old to be acting like this. She should be having conversations about what's bothering her. \n\nAnd by the way, your husband is an asshole.", "NTA. But you need to leave this man. His daughter is actively attacking your character, ruining your stuff and meddling in your relationship.\n\n I would have setup a camera to. The fact that her Dad was still pissed at YOU when you showed him proof though? He\u2019s telling you that he will never have your back when it comes to his spoiled brat.", "You have a right to film in the house for evidence of malfeasance.  \n\nYou provided proof.  You are being blamed for providing proof.\n\nDo not remake the cake, and have a serious discussion iwht your husband.\n\nSD is trying to separate you two.\n\nIf you two can't be a united front, this is a disaster for your relationship.", "NTA. The real issue here is not your stepdaughter, but your husband. He's sending a loud and clear message to her that she can do whatever she wants and he's not going to have your back. Maybe he should hand you the reins on parenting responsibilities because he's not doing a very good job. She sounds awful. If I showed my husband proof that his kid was ruining food for our family out of spite and he scolded ME for it, I'd probably be filing for divorce. Let him make his AH daughter a cake. Let him do all the cooking from now on. He's earned it.", "NTA. Do not remake the cake. Think hard about your relationship with that man because when you have proof that his daughter is making you literally throw away food and wasting money and lied about it, his first reflex is to turn against you and be mad that you filmed it... after he said he would do nothing without proof.\n\nThis is a hill I'd be willing to die on, and by that I mean I'd heavily consider ending this relationship.", "No but you should get a divorce lawyer", "Sounds like you have a stepdaughter AND husband problem. She\u2019s a toxic little shit and her enables her. He knows she\u2019s doing these things to you and does nothing because \u201cno proof\u201d yet when you provide proof he has no problems shouting at you because how dare you prove his golden child is evil.  No matter what you do you are suffering all I gotta ask is the relationship really worth putting yourself through this?", "NTA.  Your husband is just pissed because he doesn't want to actually have to deal with his daughter.  You're in a no win situation here.  He is not going to do anything and his daughter is going to continue to terrorize you in his absence.", "NTA. \n\nHusband: I won't do anything as there is no evidence.\n\nYou: Sets up a way to get evidence.\n\nHusband: How dare you provide me with evidence.", "You should have decorated it and served it as it was. Natural consequences are the best ones. And you absolutely should not have cameras set up in the house without your partner being aware; that's a huge invasion of privacy. However, your partner essentially ignoring the situation is what set you up for this situation, so ESH.", "ESH. You get to family counseling. She\u2019s still a kid and you and your husband have not stood together in all that time. You need to figure this out.", "ESH.\n\nYour husband is right to be bothered you set up \\*cameras\\* in his home, too, without his consent. Heck, in some places that could be illegal, however him coming at you instead of just asking you for your take is a failure.\n\nDon't blame you for throwing out the cake and not remaking it; she doesn't deserve that. If your family is so F'd up you are comfortably spying like this tho, wow. Like, this was exactly how you destroy and possible trust; she may be horrible but she's \\*the child\\* and you need ot learn how to work with her and not against her. \n\nDaughter sucks for being so spiteful.\n\nY'all seriously have some work to do.", "ESH\n\nObviously the daughter shouldn't be acting out like this. But clearly she hasn't fully accepted/dealt with her parent's separation/divorce and you joining her life.\n\nHer dad is clearly not parenting very well if he's letting her get away with this.\n\nI think filming went a bit far. Maybe you should have mentioned to your husband and step-daughter that you were going to do this? I'd feel very uncomfortable with one of my family members setting up a camera in the house, too.\n\nTo be clear, I think you're the LEAST AH of the three, but ESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He wanted proof before he would discipline her, you gave him that. Now he's offended about the way you gathered evidence? Obviously you were just supposed to continue taking abuse from his teenager. \n\nYou haven't done anything wrong and you deserve better.", "OP, NTA for the most part. I think I would have let everybody know that they are filmed in the kitchen... However... You are being bullied. Don't make another cake, she does not deserve it from you. Her father can make her one if he or she wants to. \nShe treats you like sh*t, you need her father to be respected, sorry but you do not have to endorse that. You are an adult, she will be soon. Grow a spine. 26 weeks per year you have to deal with an AH, just sign out being a step mom, she does not want one.\n\nEdit bc 2nd thoughts on that... I think I would have given the cake, waiting for a blow up... and stop making food the week she is here. The week she is here, it would be my off week, catching up with friends, go to the movie etc... Hb could be upset, he has to take care of HIS kid.", "So is this how you want the rest of your life to be, and your husband's really with allthis discord in your life?", "NTA, why do people constantly choose to look at something other than what the problem was. You used a camera in a public area to prove someone was ruining your food. Instead of focusing on the fact that his daughter has issues he chooses to get angry with you for filming it. Please, do not remake that cake and she owes you an apology.", "NTA. You need marriage counseling.", "NTA. I wouldve kept the cake, decorsted it, and served it to her whike playing dumb about the salt.", "Do not remake the cake because you are NTA. I mean, you could have played like you didn't know and served her the cake. Either way I feel like the end result would still be the same! I know it gets thrown around so often but I would seriously reconsider this relationship. \n\nYour hubby should be supportive of you and upset with his daughter. I get having your kid's back but the child is clearly sabotaging to the point you sought proof, and then got said proof. What more does this man need to grow a spine with his child? If he doesn't address it now it will only get worse!", "NTA. \n\nSo he wants proof, but when you have it he won\u2019t do anything. Hmm. \n\nThis is like catching someone cheating then all they want to talk about is how you went through their phone. \n\nSo NTA.", "No. He's letting that little brat walk all over you. How does he expect to get proof if she doesn't do it when he's there and you can't film it? You're in a no-win situation. Maybe hubby should do all the cooking from now on. Daughter dearest isn't going to ruin the food he cooks.", "You should leave them !", "Just imagine where your toothbrush has been.", "Whht are you the jerk she is a brat.

Really the camera was for my own sanity", "This one is new, happening for about a month. Usually she causing problems but not to this extent.", "I disagree.  It is her house, and the kitchen is a public area.

It sucks that your husband when presented with proof is still mad at you when he should be upset with his crazy daughter! She needs help, he\u2019s enabled her for too long.
