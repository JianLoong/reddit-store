His reaction to your disappointment is an over reaction.", "NTA. Everyone voting for ESH and YTA is ridiculous. OP bought this Christmas gift for her grandchild, checked in with the parents, was given the okay, and then the son said he would install the dome as he wanted it delivered to his house. Closer to Christmas Day the gift is not installed, after Christmas Day the gift is still not installed, and OP offers multiple times to have the gift installed via outside help. I am sorry when you say you will do something you do it or accept the help for it to be installed. Your son is taking out his frustrations on his children and you and that is NOT okay. I would distance myself, stop paying for the private school education, any future gifts you give the grandchildren make sure they receive it directly from you, and set up a trust/scholarship fund for the grandchildren. Your son is the type of parent who will withhold his kids from you for petty purposes unless you haven't stated everything in this post. If that is the case you now know what to expect. He 100% didn't meet your expectations because he makes promises he can't keep, gets upset when he is called out and acts like a child.", "NTA you bought a gift, checked first they were ok, had the kids to give him time to put it together which he didn\u2019t and didn\u2019t let you know. You\u2019ve offered to help so your granddaughter can use her Christmas present.", "INFO: what does the other parent think about it all? \nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA based on the post, especially if you agreed to babysit so he could put it together, but there\u2019s definitely something missing here. Is he lazy? Does his immediate family habitually suffer because of it? Because that\u2019s a larger issue. Or did he agree to the gift without his spouse\u2019s approval?  The expectations comment just seems like a projection.", "NTA for wanting that dome assembled as promised.  Your son was not thinking of his child or you when he failed to assemble it on time.  However, nothing to be gained in chastising him for his failure.  \n\nLikely there is more going on here than just meeting your expectations with the dome which is why this incidence morphed into his declining your continuing to pay for one of his children's school tuition.  Sounds to me like maybe he harbors some resentment, valid or not, maybe for feeling inadequate in general in your eyes or maybe feels sensitive to feeling directed by you, or both.  Your chastising him does smack a bit of this to me.  I get your disappointment, of course, but don't think I'd treat any of my adult children like that, even when I feel I'm in the right.  \n\nHopefully, this dome will be in working order soon.  Do what you can to peacefully help this happen.  Going forward, this is what matters in the moment.  As for the rest of the backdrop, that might take some stepping back and working not to be critical and to not let things like this turn into a power struggle. No one wins in such a situation.", "NTA, but your son is.", "Oh god. I'm having climbing dome related flashbacks here. Is it the one shaped like a hexagon? Because I suspect it's the one I bought for my (now ten year old) son's sixth birthday.\n\nIt Is A Nightmare To Erect. There are a lot of bits and you need one person holding stuff and one person slotting it together and it's composed of hexagons so each bit has six bits to not fall off and--\n\nLong story short we tried \\_really hard\\_ and the bastard thing still lived in pieces in the shed. It might still be there. I'd built various other outdoor stuff and it didn't look that hard.

Her room wasn't ready; her father said he didn't have enough time.  I'm pretty sure he had at least eight months.  I had the same amount of time and still managed to do everything that was my part; all while incubating and working 40-50 hrs/week.  \n\nThis dad just sounds like he didn't want to be bothered. OP is NTA.", "NTA, he has no right to tell you a handyman isn\u2019t allowed to build it, YOU PAID FOR IT, he has no say over what happens to it, he\u2019s said he would build it multiple times now and still hasn\u2019t and then over reacts and turns it back on you when he\u2019s called out for breaking his promise. I\u2019d say just go over there and get it yourself and have a handyman build it and give it to your granddaughter yourself. \n\nYour son is incredibly ungrateful, you\u2019re paying private school tuition for his child and he can\u2019t do you this basic favour which is ultimately benefiting his daughter.", "I suspect there are other levels here and this is just a manifestation of something deeper.\n\nGiven his reaction (and I assume \"their\" reaction if he is married and speaking for the parents as a unit) there is a sense that there are poor boundaries here - at least that might be their viewpoint. You sound like an involved grandparent - paying tuition for  one of the grandkids?  - but there may be expectations spoken or unspoken. Maybe they feel that they CANT say no to you because they are reliant on your financial contribution to their family. Its actually pretty common for money to have attached strings. \n\nI get you wanted to treat your grandchild - but a dramatic present for Christmas morning  that might upstage whatever the parents (or other grandparents) might get? I'm not saying that was your intent, but it may come across that way.  I also wonder if the big present was actually for the grandkid that you pay tuition for? Favoritism going on? \n\nMaybe it would be bettwe for the grandkids to go to their public school if it's creates better boundaries. \n\nI'm going to go with nah.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
