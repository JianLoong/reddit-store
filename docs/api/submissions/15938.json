Stranger danger needs to be clarified!! This drives me nuts.

Most of two sections of the park is height restricted.  It does two things: keeps the ride from being overloaded with adults seeking credits.  This can stress the mechanics and cause coasters to valley.  It also ensure the lines for those attractions are kept low so kids can ride them quickly and often since most have extended ride cycles that pulse the line.  A spinner ride can only load once every 5 minutes instead of more regularly like a coaster.\n\nThe ride in question is a very old, lightweight coaster.  You don\u2019t want twenty adults from the coaster club hitting it at once.", "Most six flags parks have a separate kiddie section that often has a very small coaster.  There is a height maximum for every ride in that section, with exceptions for some rides for an older child or adult companion.\n\nOdds are, if you're not with a little kid, you just walk right past that section because it's clearly marked as a child zone.", "The Smurf rollercoaster at Great America is like this.

So that is good info for next time, at least.", "You are definitely not talking about a kid's coaster.      You're talking about something like the Whizzer, which is \"kid friendly\" but not a kid's coaster.\n\nYou don't go through the coaster on a kid's ride to get to the exit.  They enter and load like any other kid's ride, and the coaster itself is tiny.\n\nOn actual kid's coasters, the line is like the swings or any spinning ride.", "Well, if he is riding by himself, he might ride next to a stranger anyway so\u2026. Same difference?\n\nIt happens on two seater rides, even at Disney.  A kid might get stuck next to a single rider on Everest or Test Track.  Heck, by the time my nephew was seven, he was the single rider on Everest, hitting a different stranger every time.  You just go through the ride before him so you can catch him at the exit.  This really isn\u2019t a big deal.\n\nThe only difference is the teens asked permission first."]}
