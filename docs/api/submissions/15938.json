I say in front of the other and let the ride operators handle the kid's seatbelts instead of doing so myself. We were friendly and they thanked me afterwards, although I just wanted to ride said coaster so that I could say I'd done all the coasters in the park.

So my options were to let my older kids ride and wait with the younger kids (which I am fine with, and now that they are all taller, I often will go through the line then wait at the exit for all 4 to ride without me) or let one of the little kids ride with a teenager who happened to be there with her volleyball team. I was so grateful for the help!", "NTA. This reminds me of the time my brother and I (F) were at a theme park. We were potentially half drunk and holding beers. This lady behind us in line with her 10 year old daughter really didn\u2019t want to be on the ride. So she asked us if we would take her daughter. We said sure. She stayed in line us until we almost go to the loading area and was there when we stepped off the ride. What an odd encounter.

I'd just watch out that your husband doesn't become a bit of a helicopter parent if this is normal behaviour for him.", "NTA \u2014 and your husband is an idiot.  \u201cStranger danger\u201d is not a thing, the number of children injured by strangers is negligible.", "I get both sides of this, stranger danger is real. However you were right there the whole time and could see them during the entire session of coaster riding. If it made your kiddo happy and made the teens happy, I don't see an issue. Those teens did a good thing, even if they had their own motivation behind it. I bet your kid had a blast. I hope he grows up to be nice like those teens one day and that he remembers the time the cool kids took him on a bunch of roller coaster rides.", "My first thought it that it is ok. Then I thought of letting my granddaughter do it and I don\u2019t think I would.", "I get your hubbs\u2019 worries but, at the same time, I would trust my kid to make a scene if they were uncomfortable. I was offered to ride some rides with random teenagers at local fairs and even at Disneyland. Those kids just wanted an even number of riders. Although this was in the early nineties, so maybe things are different now, I\u2019m not sure. I would like to think 12-15 year olds are still child-like and just wanting to go on rides.\n\nI\u2019m kind of up in the air now\u2026", "You ever heard of a wet willy?", "Listen to both seems fair :)", "That's just not true. Your instincts will pick up on things like body language and other factors that you don't consciously notice, and therefore can't logic out if it's a good idea or not. If something feels like a bad idea I don't care if logic says otherwise, it's a bad idea and it's not happening. This also works the other way. If nothing about the situation is setting you off, then it's probably worth the risk as long as you exercise common sense and reasonable caution.", "Not to mention a few thousand other people, just there to enjoy themselves!", "Funny, other parents thought that too right up to the point when a prepared sicko  proved they were careless.  Even when the kidnappings are thwarted and the kid recovered the trauma caused lasts a lifetime. They are rare but the risk is still there and the harm can be so catastrophic that it\u2019s worth being sensible and careful. \n\nThe op could have gone in line with the strangers and her kid and not gotten on the ride, just stepped aside and waited for her child to get off. She would be right there and in control of the situation the entire time.  That would have been the responsible thing. \n\nThese things do happen.  Google it", "They still could have molested him; one of the only YTA vote that isn\u2019t downvoted is from someone who had that happen to them in almost the same situation.", "I have been on some shitty-ass amusement park rides where I easily could have died or gotten injured as a child if my dad didn\u2019t hold on to me; I can\u2019t imagine a kiddie coaster being that way though.", "They were supervised from a distance - it's not like OP let them wander off around the park with her son!", "I think the point people may be missing is the Dad may not even be concerned about these teenagers specifically, but rather the message it sends to their child having several strangers accompany him on rollercoasters and thus defeating the message of \u201cstranger danger\u201d they\u2019ve tried to instill in their child.", "It\u2019s not just parents of young kids. Try going to a public meeting about a park. Usually full of the over 60s blaming anything on teenagers. It\u2019s nuts", "I doubt it\u2019s just teenagers this father distrusts. I\u2019m betting it\u2019s all people and probably even crowded places. He would have been even more pissed if she let the kid go off with some adults.", "You both sound like complete sociopaths \ud83d\ude02", "Good god you're both utterly unhinged", "...that's... not complimenting. That's being the same as each other: paranoid as hell that every single person other than you, your SO and family is \"stranger danger, Ranger!!\"", "Have you considered getting help? You and your partner sound totally unhinged here.", "James Bulger's kidnappers didn't engage in concersation with his mother and then play with him in plain sight with his mother's permission. They snatched him. This situation is not the same.\n\nSaying remember this one kid who was murdered by a 10 year old and an 11 year old 30 years ago under completely different circumstances and probably on a different continent? OP is TA necause REMEMBER JAMES BULGER.", "She didn't make a mistake though. She made a decision to allow her son to ride a roller coster with a teenager, in plain sight while waiting at the exit. Dangerous kidnappers rarely engage in conversation with parents, in a place likely covered in cameras and witnesses, and then kidnap them by running with a struggling child past his mother.\n\nHer husband just thinks she made a mistake because she treated the situation differently than he would. No apology necessary.", "I wouldn't ever let my little kid ride at a park without me there. A few years before I was born, it was common for the kids in my street to all hang out at the park across the road. Nothing could happen, right? The parents were just across the street. Then one of the neighbour kids (13 years old) murdered a little girl who lived at the end of the street (6 years old). Her dad stayed in the same house he'd raised his daughter in; he was friendly with my mother. My sisters and I grew up playing in the park where she was killed.\n\nOP's husband is ridiculous and true \"stranger danger\"  crimes aren't common. But children do kill children sometimes, and it's often someone the child knows well enough to not be afraid.", "By that logic no one should ever do anything", "That's easily balanced by teaching the child to not go with a stranger without the parent's permission.", "Teenagers are like any other people, some are dangerous most are not. We just tend to automatically assume the worst of people these days.", "I just have my keys for that.", "Kidnapping was the last thought in my mind. I'm thinking kid gets hurt (which can happen anytime) under supervision of strangers who are unlikely to be parents themselves.\n\nIt's a shame you come off as someone who would rather take chances than take extra effort to look after someone they love and set meaningful, appropriate boundaries.", "Except we are talking about caring for a child - which OP handed off temporarily to strangers. Nothing happened, but it could have. \n\nTaking responsibility doesn't end when we find an excuse that suits our style. Also your statement is expressed in a confusing way with use of absolutes and lack of context. \n\nYou don't think OP was mistaken, I think OP could have set boundaries for their kids but instead set their expectations higher and to include strangers in the mix. \n\nAs I said, a mistake - I'm not saying they are a terrible, horrible person, I am saying it was a mistake. \n\nYou are welcome to believe that strangers can be trusted like this if you feel that way.", "I know that ride needs to have flexibility to operate but the way it moves when the wind hits it is too much for me. It also didn't help that I saw a cart get stuck at the top.", "Or maybe do what you want but not while taking completely unnecessary and avoidable risks.", "The funny thing about this is that people pay strangers to watch their kids all the time. It's called day care and babysitters. But because it's teenagers and they aren't specifically hired for the purpose of babysitting, now it's a problem. As a parent myself, I absolutely would have done the same as this mom."]}
