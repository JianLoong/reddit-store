We dated for about a year, engaged for a year, and have been married for 5 years. The kids are awesome. Their mom and I have a pretty good relationship. \n\nSince I met him several years after the divorce, I only know what I was told and my understanding of my husband and his ex wife\u2019s relationship and divorce, but from what I know they were high school sweethearts who got married shortly after high school. At that time they had similar values and wanted similar things out of life, including a more traditional family structure, where the husband works and the mom is a stay at home mom. At some point they fell out of love and got divorced, and my understanding is that it was not contentious. At the time of the divorce their youngest was 5, and she wanted to continue to be a SAHM, and my husband agreed that was the best decision, so he agreed to continue paying his ex wife a certain amount of money that would allow her to stay home as long as the kids were under 18. \n\nThe youngest is now 17, and she\u2019s been applying for colleges and thinking about her future. I was around for the oldest two going through this, but at the times they were each seniors in high school I simply hadn\u2019t been in their lives as long as I\u2019ve been in the youngest\u2019s life. I\u2019ve been with her since she was 10, I love her, and am so excited to be helping her with this.\n\nHere\u2019s where I might be the asshole. She asked me if I\u2019d ever thought about being a stay at home mom and I answered honestly. No, I\u2019ve never thought about it, I never wanted that, and I wouldn\u2019t enjoy it. A couple days later, her mom called me up crying. Honestly, if she\u2019s been angry and yelling at me I would have been able to disregard it as her being unreasonable, but she wasn\u2019t angry. She\u2019s always been really kind and gracious to me, and she even was in this conversation. She was just *sad*. I guess her daughter told her she\u2019d never want to be a stay at home mom, and the mom took it as her daughter doesn\u2019t respect her or appreciate everything she\u2019s done for her kids. She also felt like I didn\u2019t respect her, and that her ex doesn\u2019t appreciate all she\u2019s done for their kids, though I tried my hardest to convince her otherwise. Because I do respect her! Her kids are awesome and that\u2019s in large part thanks to her and how she raised them! And my husband does appreciate all she\u2019s done. I don\u2019t know, she wasn\u2019t blaming me outright or anything, but she was clearly so sad about this and nothing I said made it better. I left the conversation feeling awful. I asked friends about it and they were very divided. Some said I did nothing wrong. Some said her mom is a stay at home mom and that\u2019s clearly who the daughter would have been thinking about when asking me that and I should have been more respectful.

Add into empty nest symptoms, a chapter of her life is closing and that's scary for anyone.\n\nEither way, NTA. Whatever is going on with her, you answering your step daughter honestly isn't the problem here.", "NTA\nWow! I know this isn\u2019t what you\u2019re looking for. But, wow! You and your husband\u2019s first wife are friendly enough that A) Your opinion matters to her, and B) Her feelings matter to you.\nThat is incredibly beautiful. Maybe point that out to both her and your stepdaughter.", "NAH. \n\nI think what's coming to the surface is the reality that all her children are leaving the nest and she needs to confront the fact that she's a woman without career skills. She is likely scared about what is next and is feeling like her job has come to a close. \n\nYou weren't the asshole for saying that being a SAHM wasn't a choice you'd make for yourself. Choosing not to do so is not a slight against parents who make the choice to stay at home. \n\nI don't think you were disrespectful, I don't even think you need to apologize, I just think you got the tail end of a hard moment from the mom.", "NTA. You answered honestly to the question you were asked. It doesn\u2019t sound like you denigrated her mom or the idea of a SAHM. You only talked about how you would feel if presented with the option. You can\u2019t control what others might read into that answer.", "**NTA**\n\nAnd your friends who are saying, \"She was thinking about her mom\" are trying to stir up shit and are not your friends, they're shit-disturbers.\n\nYou CLEARLY do not have any personal enmity towards either her mother or SAHMs in general. In fact, it's abundantly clear that you have tremendous respect and even some affection for her mother, and deeply appreciate the coparenting relationship you've been able to have with her and the job she's done with her kids.\n\nYou also didn't say ANYTHING denigrating about the IDEA of being a stay-at-home mother or that you had any problem with it. You said that it wasn't for you. Period. That it wasn't a choice that was suited to you as an individual, and therefore it's not something that you considered or wanted for yourself. You weren't negative in any way.\n\nI suspect, given the context, that this is what happened:\n\nThe bio mom is reaching the point where her last kid is leaving the nest and she is feeling understandably insecure about her own place in the world, about being needed and valued. Then this subject came up and her daughter (bearing in mind that teenagers are not known for being tactful) stated, perhaps more emphatically than was necessary, that she \"WOULD NEVER\" want the path that her own mother had chosen and was justifiably proud of . . . and it  stirred up some internal insecurities and was hurtful in a way that really had nothing to do with you.  But she was hurt, and ironically, the fact that your relationship has been a good one may have actually led her to feel that you would be receptive to her coming to you with her pain about this. She also may have misunderstood (or your stepdaughter may have misrepresented) the conversation as being more negative than it actually was, and by the time she talked to you, emotions were running high and she couldn't hear your reassurances.\n\nI would give it a few days, and then reach out and let her know again what you've told us: that you respect her tremendously and value her and her parenting, and that you NEVER expressed any negative views about being a SAHM parent to her child, just that it wasn't the right choice for YOU, and that you hoped that she hadn't perceived that as a slight because that was not at all how you felt. \n\nJust something to consider: My mother by turns had a career of decades as a teacher, and spent many years as a SAHM raising us, and said she never felt more judged than by other women during the years she was a SAHM, including women she had worked with. It can be really difficult. I don't think you did anything wrong at all, but I would counsel kindness to her. She's about to be an empty nester who has given the last 18 years of her life entirely to her kids. But you are NTA.", "NTA...You were asked a question which you answered honestly.  Your values have nothing do with her mother's values. You're two different people. Her mother's sadness is misplaced.", "NTA.\n\nYou were asked a question, and you answered it honestly.  The SAHM life isn't for everyone.  The ex's unhinged reaction to the situation is concerning.  Maybe she's just recently realized that her lack of a work history for the past couple of decades or so is making it hard to find a job.  She should consider offering in home daycare services for income once the financial support from your husband goes away.\n\nAnd it's your stepdaughter's prerogative to decide whether or not she wants to do what her mom did or think like you do.\n\nThe ex is a massive AH for taking out her issues on you.\n\nI don't think you should continue allowing her to use you as her emotional punching bag.  Her issues are her own, NOT YOURS.", "NTA, & also no assholes. This is a situation where you couldn't possibly have answered in a way to make everyone happy. You told your stepdaughter the truth when she asked you about being a SAHM: it's not for you. And if you hadn't told her the truth, you'd be an asshole for lying. But then specifically because her mom *is* a SAHM, you're being told you're an asshole for telling the truth about the fact that it wouldn't have suited you to do it? That's ridiculous. \n\nYou didn't talk any kind of shit about the mother, you haven't ever been disrespectful to her or about her life choices as a SAHM. Maybe she's feeling upset about it in her own right for her own reasons, since after spending so much time raising her kids she now has to go out into the world & get a job, because there won't be any more child support for her to rely on. I can sympathize with her for that, it's hard enough to get a good job even when you haven't spent two decades out of the work force. But none of that makes you an asshole for telling the truth about your own subjective preferences when your stepdaughter asked you about being a SAHM.", "NAH. Your stepdaughter asked, and you were honest. When her mom was upset, you apologized.", "Nta\n\n\nHowever, I do feel for this woman. She dedicated her life to them. And now, hearing her own daughter say she wouldn't be a stay at home mom has to be hard.\n\n\nI truly believe it is a personal decision.  I would write her a kind note explaining how you feel about her.\n\nAnd gently talk to her daughter and point out all the good things her mom has done. Encourage her to thank her mom. I think this could go a long way.\n\n\nPs I do like that you have so much respect for their mom. It shows what kind person you are. You never meant to hurt her feelings or have her daughter do the same.", "NTA\n\nAssuming you weren't bashing SAHMs there is nothing wrong with not wanting that for yourself or the daughter wanting something different. I'm not sure what the mom here was expecting or why she would be so upset by the idea that someone else would make different choices.\n\nShe is probably being more judgemental here than anyone else. That or jumping to conclusions to think others don't respect her just for not wanting to be a SAHM too. Of course if there is more to it and something said something negative about SAHMs then sure people making those comments would be the asshole.", "NAH.\n\nIt's funny because if her mom was an accountant, and you said you'd never consider being an accountant, no one would be offended.  The mom is understandably upset, because she feels her work is being disrespected, but that's not your fault.\n\nYes, you probably knew what your step-daughter was asking, and it would have been nicer of you to say something like \"but of course that's a valid choice and SAHMs make a valuable contribution to society!\"", "NAH\n\nYou didn\u2019t mean to cause offence but I think in part some of the mothers upset will be related to the big change she\u2019s about to go through. She\u2019s no longer going to be a SAHM and may well be realising that moving on from that stage in her life will be challenging and emotional. \n\nSociety doesn\u2019t value her role or skills she\u2019s accrued during that time and it may just have caught her at a bad moment to think you guys may feel the same. \n\nYou\u2019ve apologised and made clear that you do respect her role in life. \n\nThat\u2019s all you can do aside from give her time to adjust.", "NAH\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong and she's upset bc of what her daughter said to her.  You are right there is nothing wrong with being a SAHM or a working mother.  Wait a few days to call her up and talk to her again, once things calm down a bit.", "NTA. If you weren\u2019t judging her and just stating your preference for yourself, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. \n\nObviously this all falls under interpretation. That can\u2019t possibly be conveyed in your post. What did you really say to step daughter?? In what tone? How did she interpret that and convey it to mom? How did mom\u2019s feelings about her situation color what daughter told her??\n\nThere\u2019s way to much judgement of women around parenthood. Whether they are stay at home or whether they are not. There\u2019s no \u201cright\u201d choice here. And, no matter which you choose, you will feel judged by others. Sometimes they were. Sometimes they weren\u2019t.", "NTA. I'm not sure why your friends would expect you to read your stepdaughter's mind and know the ulterior motives to such a question. You answered honestly, and in no way does it diminish what her mother did for her. It's on your stepdaughter and her mother to understand that.", "NTA being a SAHM isn\u2019t everyone, lord knows I couldn\u2019t do it. You weren\u2019t bashing her mom just saying it\u2019s not for you. Sounds like her mom is projecting her own insecurities because your husband\u2019s checks will be stopping soon.", "NAH \n\nI would keep in mind that she\u2019s been a SAHM for at least two decades, and now her last child is planning a future away from her. She\u2019s probably already feeling very sensitive and unsure, as her life\u2019s work is coming to an end. \n\nI see where she\u2019s coming from in her hurt, as I\u2019m sure you do, but it\u2019s not anyone\u2019s fault. It\u2019ll be an adjustment for her and the fact that you\u2019re already offering your emotional support is wonderful. Don\u2019t internalize her feelings to be reflective of anything you or her daughter said. This is just the next part of her life, and she needs some time to process the transition.", "NAH. Your answer had nothing to do with their mother, it's your personal preference. Simple as that. However, the mom's feelings are also valid... a child you spent your entire life raising saying they would never do what you chose to do with your life, that's gotta be a crazy thing to hear. Since she wasn't mad at you, I think she was just venting/looking for a shoulder to lean on.", "Nta it\u2019s not like you said anything negative about SAHM, it\u2019s just not for you which is perfectly fine and normal. I think she\u2019s upset about something else, maybe the kids being more independent and not needing her, then just sort of took it out on you because she doesn\u2019t know how to handle it or what to do", "NTA. You were asked a direct question and answered honestly.   \nAnd the mother didn't have to take it to heart as she did; sounds like it hit some of her issues, but that's not your fault as you weren't being cruel to her. The issue isn't what you said, but how the mom perceives her daughter sees her. She should have a conversation with the daughter about that and recognize that not everyone wants the same things in life. She might learn a lot about their relationship and her daughter's aspirations in life. Choosing something doesn't mean you don't respect others' choices.  Too bad she took it as a put down.", "NTA for what everybody said.", "NTA- the mother is only a smidge an AH.\n\nI'm guessing she is going through a big shift in her identity/life. You maybe could've been a little more tactful but nothing you described was a slight against the mother or stay at home parents. Not everyone wants to or should do any given thing.", "NAH. I know with my entire heart that I never want to be a SAHM. I couldn\u2019t do it. I wouldn\u2019t enjoy it. I\u2019d be miserable. My mom was a SAHM for my entire life and I have nothing but deep respect for her and everything she sacrificed in raising me and my brother.", "NTA \n\nI have a lot of respect for SAHP but I know it wouldn\u2019t make me happy so I wouldn\u2019t wanna be one.\n\nMaybe you should sit down with the mom in a calm moment, and tell her that you have a lot of respect for her and SAHP in general but it is just not for you personally, just like another job like x would not be for you. Just pick something that you actually wouldn\u2019t like to have as a job but that is highly respected (for me it would be firefighter)\n\nAnd I\u2019m sure she\u2019s just taking some of her own feelings out on you, her youngest is about to go to college so her time of being a SAHM are almost over. She might be scared about reentering the workforce, she might have applied to jobs and gotten disrespect for being a SAHM.", "NTA and I think there's a lot more to this than just the feeling of disrespect she's vocalizing.\n\nHer nest is about to be empty, and for many SAHMs it's a make-or-break point in their lives. She thought that at his point, it would be her and her husband, rekindling the pre-child life together, going on vacations, and her taking care of him, and that's not happening either.\n\nI don't know how much your relationship boundaries would allow for this, but maybe take her out to a girl's day - get pampered, help her find the woman in her again and not just the caregiver she's been for over two decades.\n\nEven better - pay for the daughter to do it. Bonding time, have them go shopping.\n\nAnd be prepared to maybe offer a bit more emotional support once the youngest is gone until the ex finds her footing in this new reality.", "NAH\n\nBeing a stay-at-home parent is a choice. It's a perfectly valid choice, but it's not the only one, and it's not the choice that everyone wants to make. That's OK.\n\nKids don't have to want to make the same choices as their parents. My kid hates my job. They would be capable of following the same career path I did, and doing well at it, but that's not their preference. They have different interests, and that's OK. I don't feel devalued just because my kid makes different choices from me.", "Nta. It sounds like biomom is dealing with a soon to be empty nest, as well as having to start supporting herself again.", "NTA. \n\nIt is not your responsibility to be the gatekeeper for ex\u2019s feelings. You were honest when your stepdaughter asked you, which is nothing to feel bad about. \n\nNor is it your responsibility that the ex has an antiquated view about household responsibilities and duties. \n\nShe created the exact life she wanted, and there\u2019s no reason she should be upset that her daughter wants to create her own version of a life, even though it differs from hers. \n\nI mean, in this day and age, there aren\u2019t too many women who want to be a sahm. \n\nMy guess is that she isn\u2019t crying only because of what her daughter said, she\u2019s crying because she realizes now, with her youngest going to college, that her life will now have no purpose.", "NTA - you answered honestly and never once said the mother made the wrong choice by being a stay at home mom. It is also hard to know what the daughter said exactly to the mother. Some people are meant to be stay at home parents and others just aren't. \n\nAs others have said, she is also coming to terms with the fact that she essentially no longer has a full time job once her daughter goes off to college. While you never stop being a mom the empty nest syndrome can be real.", "NTA. Your stepdaughter asked you a question, you answered it honestly. There was no need for tact. You didn't disrespect people who did or do choose to become SAHM. Just like you are not disrespecting vegetarians if you say that you would never choose to become one.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHER sadness about YOUR preferences and your life chicesis NONE of your business.

IF the ex is guilting YOU that hard, imagine what is happening to the kid.", "NTA - you were honestly answering a question - no I don't want to be a SAHM, there's nothing wrong with that.", "INFO: What exactly did you say to your step daughter about being a SAHM?", "NTA Your answer was solely about your personal preferences and wasn't a put-down of SAH mothers in general. *You* didn't want that. *You* wouldn't enjoy it. If you had said you have never wanted to be a doctor that wouldn't be a put-down of doctors either.\n\nThe mother may be insecure about herself, but that doesn't require you to pretend to her daughter that you personally would like to be a SAHM. Your preferences and life choices aren't a commentary on or judgement of the mother's. It's a pity she took it that way, but if the daughter was asking adult women about their life choices so she could think about her own, I don't see it as wrong for you to be honest about your own life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But whenever I'm asked / it comes up in conversation, when I say that I feel like I absolutely have to add the disclaimer that every woman is different and I think SAHM is a tough job and they deserve recognition. If I don't add that on, I inevitably catch attitude about how SAHMs \"have it so hard.\"\n\nI don't think you were at all trying to be disrespectful and you were answer a question about your personal preference. I think her mother took it the wrong way because she's facing the departure of her last child from the nest, and is about to lose her main job as a SAHM. \n\nI think maybe a follow-up convo with her mother would be warranted to simply explain that you were specifically talking about YOU, and reminding her that she did a great job and you respect her. \n\nNobody is in the wrong. It was just some charged emotions.", "NAH. \n\nYou gave the most appropriate answer to your stepdaughter that you could, and you made it about you. Your stepdaughter obviously feels the same way, and that's fine!\n\nI'm guessing mom is insecure about missing so much of the working world for so long - while it's great she was able to be there for her kids full time, it's got to be pretty intimidating to come back and see where everyone else has gotten in that time frame.  She *shouldn't* feel bad, it's not necessarily a logical thing.\n\nYou should try and have an open and honest conversation with your stepdaughter - don't blame her for making her mom feel bad, but get her to see both angles (it's fine to be a stay at home mom and very respectable, just like it's fine to not want to stay at home and just as respectable) - let her know that her mom could use encouragement, and even a nice little gesture from her daughter saying how much she's benefited from having her mom available so often could go a long way.", "NAH. It sounds like both of you handled the situation really well. I wonder how the conversation between mom and 17 year old went though. Seems like a lot of feelings for a kid simply saying they don't want to be a SAHM.", "Unfortunately there's not enough time in life to do everything we would have liked to. Which means we often live with a lot of what ifs, what could have been's etc. In light of that you'd hope your life's work was appreciated.

Imitation is the greatest form of flattery they say, but a lack of it doesn't mean what you've dedicated your time to isn't appreciated or valued. You've done nothing wrong, NTA. It's a testament to you all as a group that this communication existed at all. She is processing that feeling and will get through it.", "NAH", "NAH - I think a teenager that maybe admires you, without thought said something to her mother.  If you are hanging close to this child, maybe a subtle return to the conversation; 'hey, you know the other day when you asked me about being a SAHM?  I'd like to circle back to that for some clarification.  That was not in the cards for me but everyone is different and all the work SAHMs do is incredible and sadly, usually thankless.  (insert examples of things she benefited from having her mom at home that you did not do)   So if you are thinking about your future, never dismiss the work of a SAHM as 'less than or easier' - because there are a lot of us who could have never done it...   \n\nIf you feel bad about how the ex is feeling; send her some flowers or something nice with a heartfelt note about how much you understand and appreciate all she has done.  Also, she could simply be in a tough place in general; her last kid going off to college, so she is about to face starting a new life, maybe some insecurities about going back to the work force, the financial support ending, etc. ..", "NTA but you were walking a very thin line. What you said, what your stepdaughter heard, what your stepdaughter told her mother, and what her mother heard may have been completely different things.

Her mother may have heard that the people in her life do not respect her. This is perhaps the shortest and yet most convoluted game of telephone ever. You were talking about a somewhat sensitive (at times contentious) topic with a teenager. Teenagers aren\u2019t know for their ability to consider and interpret nuance. I\u2019m not surprised that some miscommunication occurred. Your not an asshole but you probably should apologize to the ex wife.

By taking offense to this, she\u2019s kind of stacking her claim that SAHP is important and anyone who wouldn\u2019t choose to do it must disagree that it\u2019s important. \n\nShe\u2019s really upset that her daughter said it, but that\u2019s putting too much of her own self worth into the partially formed view of a teenager. If my kid tells me he would never want to get into teaching, I would tell him \u201cgood\u201d and not take it as a blow to my self worth.", "NAH\nIm a SAHM and I can understand how she's hurt just because there are some people who look down on SAHMs and believe we're just lazy. My friend is a working mom and she has told me that while she misses her kids, she couldn't stay home with them as she would lose her mind. \n\nAt work, when it's your break time, you get an actual break. When I get a break time, it's usually when they're napping or I'm in the bathroom. Just like working isn't easy, neither is staying home. It can test your patience and sanity at times. BUT it is rewarding watching your little ones grow in front of you everyday", "NTA. You weren't disrespectful; you didn't say anything negative about being a SAHM, just that you wouldn't like it. I wouldn't either, though I have a lot of respect for people who can do it. It may be that mom is insecure about her choice or just reacting to her youngest growing up, but it's not something you caused.", "NTA. In any way.  You sound like a lovely person.", "NAH. You didn\u2019t do a thing wrong. And neither did mom. She\u2019s also probably having a lot of feelings about being an empty nester and having to go into the workforce for the first time.", "OP has nothing to apologize for.", "I have a career that I love, but I have a hard time taking more than a few days off due to feeling so out of the loop upon my return. The idea of entering the workforce after not having a job outside the home for 20 years sounds terrifying. I wouldn\u2019t even know where to start looking. She\u2019s probably having an existential crisis and feeling like she\u2019s losing the purpose that she has dedicated her life to. Kind of like if you built a career over multiple decades and one day the job was just done. Parenting never really is of course, but it still must be difficult. \n\nYou are definitely NTA, but since you\u2019re close you might want to approach you it\u2019s compassion and just ask how she\u2019s doing with all the changes. Ask her if she has plans for her time and just let her share.", "The ex making jokes about single life might be her \"whistling past the graveyard\" as she could be worried about her financial future.", "That\u2019s amazing, you rock.", "Yeah I can just see her turning up to careers advice and the advisors telling her to start a blog LOL", "Exactly. What has she been doing for all these years while her kids were at school? They are gone at least 7-8 hours per day. She had a long time to anticipate that she won\u2019t have any child support and she has to find a way to support herself.", "You didn't do anything wrong and she's upset bc of what her daughter said to her. You are right there is nothing wrong with being a SAHM or a working mother.", "NAH, you shouldn't lie to make the ex feel better. And she shouldn't expect her kids to want her life.", "NTA. You never wanted to be a dentist or a racecar driver either. Your co-parent is going through some big feelings at the end of 20+ years as a stay-at-home mom and hearing that her daughter is taking after you in not wanting that made her feel unappreciated.\n\nIt sounds like you all have good communication and I think you can talk this out with her another day when it's settled down.", "Nta obviously. You answered a question about yourself. Everyone else can have their feelings.", "NAH\n\nI think everyone just needs a sit-down and to talk about what they think honestly and resolve the misunderstanding. Different people, different walks of life. Their mum might have unresolved issues from being a SAHM that need to be sensitively fleshed out if anything. This sounds like a prime moment for building rapport with each other even more if anything.\n\nGood luck, hope it works out well!", "Yea I\u2019m genuinely wondering/concerned if she\u2019s been using some of the hours her youngest is at school applying to jobs? Waiting until the kid is 18 is nottt the move and she needs to start building a safety net ASAP.", "YOu are implyinfg that irt would be the daughter's duty to manage her mom's feelings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nrealistically ... when the ex is acting like that to people less close, it must be much worse for the daughter.", "NTA. The ex wife clearly has an inferiority complex. I don't blame her, but that's her problem.", "All you can do in these situations is be truthful.\n\nSure, you could have said, 'But that doesn't mean being a SAHM isn't a great choice.' But is it? These days? How many people actually get to make that choice and then are happy with it really longterm?A full time SAHM often ends up with no skills and no work history when the kids leave - as perhaps this woman will once the last child turns 18. And then the consequences are that the fastest growing group of homeless people are women over 55 (ex-SAHMs mostly) because they're divorced, their child support has stopped, and they just can't get jobs.\n\nSorry, a bit ranty, but being a full time SAHM until your children are 18+ is actually a bad choice for most women, and telling OP she should have been more enthusiastic about it in order to salve the child's mother is bad advice *for the child*. NTA", "NAH. \n\nBeing a stay at home parent comes with its own risks, just like any other job. Stay at home parents need to be aware of those risks and should receive the support they need to deal with the emotional and psychological burden of those risks.", "NTA, she's projecting, she's probably stressed about what her life will be like now that the kids don't need a SAHM anymore.", "NTA", "NTA You answered honestly for yourself- not for anyone else. It\u2019s great that 17 has 2 role models who each took different paths and she can choose for herself.", "NTA. The daughter is old enough for you to give her an honest answer about it. Her saying she doesn't want to be a sahm has nothing to do with her mother, nor is it a criticism of her mother. I think her mom is dealing with a lot emotionally right now and doesn't know what to do.", "Both sad and scary", "My first thought was that your husband should help her financially to reskill because she is about to struggle.", "I'm suggesting an enjoyable activity that would benefit everyone. Daughter doesn't even have to know why OP is suggesting it.\n\nFrom the post, all parties involved seem like great parents. \n\nYou're projecting.", "She was in fantastic position... No husband, but money trickling in to maintain the lifestyle even when kids were practically adults. But looks as she was not really thinking about the future.\nI assume she is nervous now because she must start working in late stage of life and she does not have a retirement plan.\nShe should have started working at least 5-6 years ago."]}
