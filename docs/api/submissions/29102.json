You have communicated to her what your plan is.  Look, I don't get video games, I don't play them and don't want to.  You probably wouldn't get my hobbies either and none of that is the point.  The point is you've been planning for this for a while, are super excited about it, had it blocked off, told her, and she is not hearing you.

I hope install goes without a hitch and that you have an awesome time. \n\nIf she doesn't get this, I think this needs to be a serious conversation AFTER your day with your game.", "NTA she knew you took a free day just to play this game,even beforehand so you were clear that you wanted time for yourself.If it would be an emergency and you wouldn't go you would be the A but not just because she likes to go to an happy hour place.\n\nThat said you know this won't be the end of it right?\nEven if she stays at home she won't let you play,your chance is to arrange something to keep her busy otherwise and overstep your boundary either way have fun with probably spiderman 2", "NTA\nYou already have plans for Friday evening.", "NTA, were you just repeating yourselves back and forth?\n\nIt sounds like there's something she's not understanding, does she game herself?", "NTA You told her you had plans.
