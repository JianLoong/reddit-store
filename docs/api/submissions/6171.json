My son spotted a toy ball with cute strawberry characters on it. He absolutely loved it and begged me to buy it for him. I told him that maybe Santa would get it for him for Christmas. I then purchased the ball and put it away for Christmas.\n\nFour months go by. Not a week goes by that my son doesn't mention the ball. Quite frankly, I've never seen him so excited about something before. I was super excited for him to open it on Christmas morning.\n\nSo Christmas rolls around and my husband and I give my son his gifts. He opens the ball and he's ecstatic! My husband, on the other hand, was less than thrilled. He knew all about the ball but apparently he had never taken a \"close look\" at it. He tells me he's \"concerned that our son would want what was clearly a toy for girls\". I was shocked and tried to explain that it was just a toy ball and it didn't really matter who it was marketed for. He drops the conversation and I thought the issue was settled.\n\nSo fast-forward a week. The ball suddenly goes \"missing\" from our house. My son is distraught and I have no idea where it went. My husband then reveals to me privately that he had given the ball to his brother to give to his younger niece and purchased him a different one (Spiderman, which, granted, he loves).\n\nI was obviously livid. I reminded him of our son's love for the ball, and how excited he was to get it. I told him that what he did was incredibly insensitive and thoughtless. Husband argues that he did it for the \"greater good\" and that he was \"protecting our son from bullying.\" I replied that he was being ridiculous and that our son wouldn't be bullied for having a toy that is traditionally viewed as being for girls (to be honest, it didn't even look like a girl's toy!). \n\nSo here's where I may have taken things a bit too far: I told my son \"The reason why the ball is gone is because your dad gave it away to someone else without asking.\" My husband was immediately angry with me and told me that I'm \"trying to turn our son against him\" and that I should have \"left it alone.\". He's dead set on the fact I'm in the wrong here, but I feel like I was just telling the truth and that it needed to be said. \n\nLooking back, maybe it was a bit wrong of me to tell my son the truth as that's going to hurt him and strain their relationship. But at the same time, I don't think it's right for my husband to interfere with our son's Christmas gift without consulting either of us first. \n\nPerhaps I could have handled the situation better by not telling our son.

He has no right to be angry at you, and needs therapy to get over the idea that a ball with strawberries is a threat to his manhood.", "NTA- shutting husband down for his lying and manipulative BS by making honesty a good policy is fine. But just be sure that you are not also playing games where he can expose your behavior.", "What in the rotten marshmallow puff kinda nonsense is your husband carrying on about a dang on toy.. you\u2019re N T A for sticking up for your boy. Ironically your husband bullied the situation under the guise of your son not getting bullied. He needs to kick rocks with that. I don\u2019t know how I feel about you telling your young son of this so I am withholding full judgment. At the end of the day you are married to a bully who has many other issues beyond misogyny. Id let husband know there will never ever be another type of event involving all these nasty behaviors or you need to peace all the way out. Good luck.", "NTA and if your husband\u2019s masculinity is threatened by strawberries, the ball is the least of your problems. Why raise a child with someone like that?", "Wow. Firstly nta. Secondly, please dm me if you need help. So many red flags have turned up from this one interaction you\u2019re talking of. The toxic masculinity, the gaslighting, the Highkey homophobia and sexism, it\u2019s just a yikes the chat. Highly recommend a divorce attorney and track shoes cause girl you need to run.", "NTA - but does the husband not realize that his son will see the niece with the ball and assume she stole it\u2026hello why is this not being addressed", "I hate to say it (No I don't) but you're living with someone who clearly does not support the LGBTQ+ community. In his mind (most likely) he believes this will \"Turn your son gay and/or trans.\" This was a heavy belief I saw in my own family when it came to me & a few of my cousins. \n\nIf someone being hateful towards your sons interest in a toy he clearly was happy about just because of a preconcieved notion he has is someone you wish to stay around then by all means go for it. What you did today(?) though will continually happen & will not stop. Your son will learn to hide who he is (whether it be gay or straight, trans or cis) and he will learn that you are a silent partner in his fathers antics (if you could call them that) because you're choosing to stay and fight an uphill battle that neither you nor your son will win. He will not change his mind on this. \n\nAll this to say; NTA but you need to take a closer look at who your husband is. He's a man in his early 40's projecting his own insecurities on a 7 year old child & that's never okay, especially as his parent.", "NTA- I'm a strong believer in not lying to kids because they'll grow up questioning if you're being honest with them or not. Also your son being the age he is, he most likely would have gotten bored of the ball after a few months and it would have been just another toy in his collection.\nYour husband seems really concerned about his son being feminine which screams homophobia, how would he react if when your son is older he actually does turn out to be part of the LGBT+ community?", ">\tmy husband  \n  \n\n>\tmy wife", "Good rule of thumb in life: if you don't do things that are shameful, you don't have to worry when someone tells the truth about you. \n\nIf telling the truth about your husband's actions will \"turn your son against him,\" then that means that *his actions* are what turned your son against him.\n\nNTA. Your husband has a lot of nerve demanding that you lie to your son (potentially ruining *your* relationship with him) to cover up the fact that he *stole* from your son and betrayed him. At least this way, your son has one parent he can trust.", "NTA your husband\u2019s behavior is a prime example of toxic masculinity. Not all masculinity is toxic but masculinity like this is. Personally, this would be a big issue for me as a parent. We\u2019d be in therapy or be getting divorced before I allowed my kid to force fed this type of garbage for their entire lives. What happens when your son is older and might disagree with dad? Is your husband going to bully him for liking girls things? I\u2019d be very concerned if I were you.", "NTA.  And I would google to find a new ball exactly like your son had, purchase it (with joint funds), and let your husband know there will be serious consequences to your marriage if he touches it.", "**NTA** as you simply told the truth.", "NTA. Your husband is upset that you told your son the truth? Your husband is a huge AH and I hope your son grows up with a better role model.", "NTA, HE is the hypothetical bully he is worried about. HE is treating your son how he claims to worry others will. What a disgusting person.\n\nWhats he going to do next? Call him fat to encourage him to lose weight so he doesnt get called fat? Beat him up so he learns how to not get beat up? The logic at play here is just incredible.", "NTA.  You\u2019re married to one.", "ESH sorry!\n\nYour husband is a massive a******e for thinking a ball with strawberry characters makes a 7 year old gay! And he\u2019s an even bigger a******e for taking that toy away from your son!\n\nBut you are also an light a******e for telling a 7 year old his Dad took something as that is totally confusing for a little kid. He just wants to live you both and feel loved by you both. \n\nThe best thing would have been to make your husband get the ball back from his brother. Your son will see it when they catch up!", "NTA\n\nHe can't argue for a united front after deliberately undermining you and stealing something your son adored over some sort of gay panic. The homophobe stealing joy from kids is always TA.", "So to prevent his son from being bullied he bullied his son by giving away his toy? Here is hoping your son never displays any traits that his dad doesn't see as boy traits apparently.", "NTA \n\nYour son deserved to know the truth about his beloved ball.", "I'm making a list of the things women own. So far I have butterflies and strawberries. Mmmm.", "NTA - how fragile is your husband\u2019s masculinity?! The only bully is him. There is no such thing as a boy or girl toy and your son would wonder what happened to his ball. I\u2019m so glad you were honest about this bigoted display instead of covering for him.", "ESH. \n\nHusband is a total AH, obviously. His masculinity is so fragile that it\u2019s hardly masculinity. I obviously don\u2019t know you or him but, if his toxic behaviour isn\u2019t limited to this instance, I am worried for you. \n\nBut your reaction felt vengeful. Instead of resolving the issue with your husband, you essentially weaponised your son in this whole process.", "Definitely NTA. Husband needs to understand that people like all kinds of things that wouldn't fit standard gender norms and it's ok. Maybe he needs to talk with your son too and apologize \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA, but I am assuming here that you told your son in response to him asking where the ball went. If he asked, he should be told the truth. If you sought him out and told him about it unprompted, then I feel a little differently\u2026\n\nThe fact of the matter is that your husband knows what he did was wrong, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t be upset about your son knowing the truth. As many others have mentioned, this screams homophobia/transphobia, so it might be time for a bigger discussion with your husband.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's possible he's trying to protect the kid from his own trauma and going about it really badly. Childhood bullying is a massive issue, people rarely get adequate help for it and men in particular are discouraged from talking about vulnerable feelings - it's a perfect storm that might encourage him to act like this.", "ESH.

That sucks for you. \n\nFeel free to leave him. Do not drag your child into your arguments. Teach your child better than he does, work on inclusivity, acceptance, and not gendering toys.
