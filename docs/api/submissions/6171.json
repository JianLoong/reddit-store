My son spotted a toy ball with cute strawberry characters on it. He absolutely loved it and begged me to buy it for him. I told him that maybe Santa would get it for him for Christmas. I then purchased the ball and put it away for Christmas.\n\nFour months go by. Not a week goes by that my son doesn't mention the ball. Quite frankly, I've never seen him so excited about something before. I was super excited for him to open it on Christmas morning.\n\nSo Christmas rolls around and my husband and I give my son his gifts. He opens the ball and he's ecstatic! My husband, on the other hand, was less than thrilled. He knew all about the ball but apparently he had never taken a \"close look\" at it. He tells me he's \"concerned that our son would want what was clearly a toy for girls\". I was shocked and tried to explain that it was just a toy ball and it didn't really matter who it was marketed for. He drops the conversation and I thought the issue was settled.\n\nSo fast-forward a week. The ball suddenly goes \"missing\" from our house. My son is distraught and I have no idea where it went. My husband then reveals to me privately that he had given the ball to his brother to give to his younger niece and purchased him a different one (Spiderman, which, granted, he loves).\n\nI was obviously livid. I reminded him of our son's love for the ball, and how excited he was to get it. I told him that what he did was incredibly insensitive and thoughtless. Husband argues that he did it for the \"greater good\" and that he was \"protecting our son from bullying.\" I replied that he was being ridiculous and that our son wouldn't be bullied for having a toy that is traditionally viewed as being for girls (to be honest, it didn't even look like a girl's toy!). \n\nSo here's where I may have taken things a bit too far: I told my son \"The reason why the ball is gone is because your dad gave it away to someone else without asking.\" My husband was immediately angry with me and told me that I'm \"trying to turn our son against him\" and that I should have \"left it alone.\". He's dead set on the fact I'm in the wrong here, but I feel like I was just telling the truth and that it needed to be said. \n\nLooking back, maybe it was a bit wrong of me to tell my son the truth as that's going to hurt him and strain their relationship. But at the same time, I don't think it's right for my husband to interfere with our son's Christmas gift without consulting either of us first. \n\nPerhaps I could have handled the situation better by not telling our son.

Ironically your husband bullied the situation under the guise of your son not getting bullied. He needs to kick rocks with that. I don\u2019t know how I feel about you telling your young son of this so I am withholding full judgment. At the end of the day you are married to a bully who has many other issues beyond misogyny. Id let husband know there will never ever be another type of event involving all these nasty behaviors or you need to peace all the way out. Good luck.", "NTA and if your husband\u2019s masculinity is threatened by strawberries, the ball is the least of your problems. Why raise a child with someone like that?", "Wow. Firstly nta. Secondly, please dm me if you need help. So many red flags have turned up from this one interaction you\u2019re talking of. The toxic masculinity, the gaslighting, the Highkey homophobia and sexism, it\u2019s just a yikes the chat. Highly recommend a divorce attorney and track shoes cause girl you need to run.", "NTA - but does the husband not realize that his son will see the niece with the ball and assume she stole it\u2026hello why is this not being addressed", "I hate to say it (No I don't) but you're living with someone who clearly does not support the LGBTQ+ community. In his mind (most likely) he believes this will \"Turn your son gay and/or trans.\" This was a heavy belief I saw in my own family when it came to me & a few of my cousins. \n\nIf someone being hateful towards your sons interest in a toy he clearly was happy about just because of a preconcieved notion he has is someone you wish to stay around then by all means go for it. What you did today(?) though will continually happen & will not stop. Your son will learn to hide who he is (whether it be gay or straight, trans or cis) and he will learn that you are a silent partner in his fathers antics (if you could call them that) because you're choosing to stay and fight an uphill battle that neither you nor your son will win. He will not change his mind on this. \n\nAll this to say; NTA but you need to take a closer look at who your husband is.

Also your son being the age he is, he most likely would have gotten bored of the ball after a few months and it would have been just another toy in his collection.\nYour husband seems really concerned about his son being feminine which screams homophobia, how would he react if when your son is older he actually does turn out to be part of the LGBT+ community?", ">\tmy husband  \n  \n\n>\tmy wife", "Good rule of thumb in life: if you don't do things that are shameful, you don't have to worry when someone tells the truth about you. \n\nIf telling the truth about your husband's actions will \"turn your son against him,\" then that means that *his actions* are what turned your son against him.\n\nNTA.

At least this way, your son has one parent he can trust.", "NTA your husband\u2019s behavior is a prime example of toxic masculinity. Not all masculinity is toxic but masculinity like this is. Personally, this would be a big issue for me as a parent. We\u2019d be in therapy or be getting divorced before I allowed my kid to force fed this type of garbage for their entire lives.

And he\u2019s an even bigger a******e for taking that toy away from your son!\n\nBut you are also an light a******e for telling a 7 year old his Dad took something as that is totally confusing for a little kid.

So far I have butterflies and strawberries. Mmmm.", "NTA - how fragile is your husband\u2019s masculinity?! The only bully is him.

I obviously don\u2019t know you or him but, if his toxic behaviour isn\u2019t limited to this instance, I am worried for you. \n\nBut your reaction felt vengeful. Instead of resolving the issue with your husband, you essentially weaponised your son in this whole process.", "Definitely NTA. Husband needs to understand that people like all kinds of things that wouldn't fit standard gender norms and it's ok.
