We are a healthful household and we teach moderation and controlling how much we take when we have treats. We are also very active and every day strive to get the boys moving.\n\nHowever, Gwen is only here two weekends a month, and her mother has the exact opposite attitude. In all honesty that woman's blood type is probably ketchup. Similarly, Gwen is about 20lb heavier than a 5 year old girl is supposed to be.\n\nIt makes me sad for this child and her health so when we get her I try to teach Gwen about healthy eating and moving around. We have the boys play with her so she's getting active, and we make a distinction between foods that are healthy and ones that aren't. When I see one of the kids reaching for a \"treat\" food in the pantry I'll ask \"would you like to make a healthier choice?\" And Gwen is really getting it, she's always going for better choices now and is also asking for fruit at home which is really good.\n\nGwen's birthday ended up falling on one of her weekends with us, and while we were talking about what kind of cake to have, I asked Gwen about the healthier choice. My reasoning is unfortunately she's still getting all that garbage at home, and it's just not good for a growing girl. She agreed and we decided to have some low fat ice cream so she can still have a sweet treat. It's a brand Gwen loves and asks for every time she's here, so she was happy with it.\n\nUntil the next day after she went back to mom. Her mom called us furious, she said then when Gwen got home and she asked about her birthday with us and her cake, Gwen started crying because she really did want cake but didn't want to \"make a bad choice\". She accused me of fat shaming her and her daughter and that I owe her a cake and a big apology.\n\nI'm just looking out for the health of a child in my care, but I never said Gwen couldn't have cake and she could have had one if she said she wanted one. I suggested sticking to ice cream because I care. But did I go about it in a TA way?", "created_utc": 1678678829, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pz2zl/aita_for_not_having_cake_for_her_birthday/", "score": 7212, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Poor kid.", "There are lower sugar cakes you can bake with applesauce, beets,  bananas etc etc etc. She didnt even think of substituting a low sugar cake.

She's 5, it's her birthday, cake on a birthday is perfectly acceptable even if you are trying to instill healthy choices in your kids. You have to also teach them self control and moderation, strict denial does not teach these principles. OP you are setting your children up for major failures in the future. You are coming from a place of concern and that is ok, but essentially what you are doing is guilting them into making the choices you want. This may not be your intent but this is what you are doing.   \n\n\nI had a parent like this and I will tell you 100% what will happen. As soon as they are able they will stuff their face with everything possible, horrible relationships with food, and eating disorders.   \n\n\nOP, YTA, I am not going to be overly harsh, you just don't know the unintended consequences of what you are doing. Please talk to a proper nutritionist about how to educate the kids in a healthy manner. They really are not that expensive and talking to one sadly into my 30s, changed my life completely. They helped me see a healthy relationship with food isn't always being hard on myself for having those \"treat\" foods but that I couldn't eat them all the time. Maybe doing this will save them money on therapy later, cause I had to pay for that too, I didn't realize how much power food had over me because of my upbringing.   \n\n\nOh btw, you can make sugar free pretty much everything these days, there are plenty of recipes out there and these days a lot of them there is very little difference in taste. (source: Am diabetic and cannot eat sugar) This will reduce the calories considerably and remove the sugar completely. Also, full fat is better than low fat, to compensate for the low fat they add more chemicals/sugars to make it taste ok, so they are getting less fat but more sugar and in the end....thats fat.", "My feeling was that OP genuinely did not mean to manipulate, but this whole situation is still definitely in the wrong. No matter what the kid's dietary or health situation is, short of an actual allergy or similar condition like celiac, birthdays are not the time to think about healthy or unhealthy choices. Birthdays are like a *quintessential* exception to usual habits, both for kids and for adults and even in the situation where someone needs to lose/not gain weight. Go on over to r/loseit and everyone will advocate to eat what you feel like on your damn birthday, as well as a few holidays, just not letting it turn into the entire winter holiday season.\n\nAnd I just want to raise a flag that handling the situation of an overweight or overeating child needs to be handled really carefully with split parenting. It is much more straightforward to shape a child's diet and relationship with food when they live with you all the time, whether that is to make treats not really part of their awareness or to make them fully available and not a big deal (I think both approaches can work depending on the child). But with split parenting between two households with different philosophies, there's a really high risk to feel deprived in one environment and go overboard in the other.\n\nI was in the opposite situation, where I spent most of my time with the \"healthy\" household and went on weekends to the \"treat\" household. I think my parents did pretty much everything right that they could, short of coming up with a united plan between both households, but still, I knew I could get the good stuff on the weekend, and once puberty hormones hit I started to get a little overweight and once I started making some of my own money I always spent it on candy and ice cream and I stayed overweight until I became an adult and could objectively look at my situation without influence. I *still* came out with some mild issues, and still came out overweight, and it could have been so much worse if my parents weren't careful to guide very gently and never make it about my body. This might not be a battle that OP can win, and it's absolutely imperative that the child doesn't perceive their body or food intake as being a battleground.", "Yes, *I* would feel ashamed and judged if someone asked \"would you like to make a healthier choice?\" to me. The difference is that I can rationalize it and answer \"Nope, I want this\". Or tell the person to mind her own business. A 5 year old doesn't see it that way. The poor kid only knows the words feel bad and feels that she doesn't have a real choice if she wants the adult's approval - which a 5 year old desperately wants.", "The only place I see them now is the dollar store.

As someone who had food moralized like this as a kid it didn't teach me moderation, it taught me to sneak the \"bad\" stuff and to overindulge when I could (like if I was at a friend's house) -- bad habits that followed me to adulthood and that I still struggle with now that \"when I can\" is literally whenever.

People in larger bodies can be very healthy and people in smaller bodies can be very unhealthy. \n\n2. Even if this really is about health and not about weight shaming, health is not a moral imperative. Nobody owes you their good health, and a person does not commit an immoral act by not being as \u201chealthy\u201d as you would like them to be. \n\n3. Food is morally neutral. There are no good foods or bad foods.\n\n4. Mental health is as important as physical health. The two are intertwined and frequently impact each other. In a lot of families, parents focus on their children\u2019s physical health at the expense of their mental health. This is what you are doing every time you stop Gwen from having a treat and \u201casking\u201d her to choose something healthier. You are teaching her that she is wrong and bad to want the things she wants. You are teaching her that the way her body looks is more important that the way she feels, either physically or emotionally. \n\n5. Boys can also get eating disorders.
