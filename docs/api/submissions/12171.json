We are a healthful household and we teach moderation and controlling how much we take when we have treats. We are also very active and every day strive to get the boys moving.\n\nHowever, Gwen is only here two weekends a month, and her mother has the exact opposite attitude. In all honesty that woman's blood type is probably ketchup. Similarly, Gwen is about 20lb heavier than a 5 year old girl is supposed to be.\n\nIt makes me sad for this child and her health so when we get her I try to teach Gwen about healthy eating and moving around. We have the boys play with her so she's getting active, and we make a distinction between foods that are healthy and ones that aren't. When I see one of the kids reaching for a \"treat\" food in the pantry I'll ask \"would you like to make a healthier choice?\" And Gwen is really getting it, she's always going for better choices now and is also asking for fruit at home which is really good.\n\nGwen's birthday ended up falling on one of her weekends with us, and while we were talking about what kind of cake to have, I asked Gwen about the healthier choice. My reasoning is unfortunately she's still getting all that garbage at home, and it's just not good for a growing girl. She agreed and we decided to have some low fat ice cream so she can still have a sweet treat. It's a brand Gwen loves and asks for every time she's here, so she was happy with it.\n\nUntil the next day after she went back to mom. Her mom called us furious, she said then when Gwen got home and she asked about her birthday with us and her cake, Gwen started crying because she really did want cake but didn't want to \"make a bad choice\". She accused me of fat shaming her and her daughter and that I owe her a cake and a big apology.\n\nI'm just looking out for the health of a child in my care, but I never said Gwen couldn't have cake and she could have had one if she said she wanted one. I suggested sticking to ice cream because I care. But did I go about it in a TA way?", "created_utc": 1678678829, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pz2zl/aita_for_not_having_cake_for_her_birthday/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My reasoning is unfortunately she's still getting all that garbage at home, and it's just not good for a growing girl. She agreed and we decided to have some low fat ice cream so she can still have a sweet treat.

So to be clear you would be better off buying your husband\u2019s daughter a nice cake from a local bakery or ice cream from a non chain ice cream place made with real ingredients and limiting portion size appropriate to a child her age than buying her \u201clow fat\u201d ice cream. Your nutrition advice is off, but I also assume you just don\u2019t care that much for this little girl who either was the product of an affair or a time when you and your husband were going through a separation. That\u2019s not the little girl\u2019s fault and she should not be subjected to your disdain. Frankly I hope neither you nor your husband or children never become disabled or have to take a medication that causes you to gain weight . Your approach to food and nutrition appears borderline obsessive/unhealthy to the point that I worry about what kind of message your boys are also getting explicitly or implicitly from you.", "YTA. Cake should be for celebrations, this is part of moderation. You are not teaching her healthy habits you are teaching her to feel guilty about what she eats.", "Yeah. You\u2019re giving your kids eating disorders. You are a bad mother, stop fat shaming a little girl.", "YTA", "YTA. Statistically at the age of 6 little girls start to hate their body. Between 40%and 60% of elementary aged girls hate their body. That statistic jumps up to 80% by the teenage years. Some research also says that kids as young as 3 have body image issues. Don\u2019t doom her to this statistic. \nIf you must make choices for her then do so silently. Stop pushing it on her to make the right decision, she is a child she shouldn\u2019t have to worry about that. \n\nI am someone who believes that having obese children is a form of neglect and abuse, but at two weekends a month you should make her feel loved not that she is constantly making the wrong choices or has to choose what she knows you want. You aren\u2019t teaching, you are testing. I do believe you can go about this kindly and she will grasp it on her own. Lead by example, don\u2019t shove it down her throat and don\u2019t make her feel inadequate.", "LET HER HAVE CAKE \n\nthere is absolutely nothing wrong with teaching children about healthy eating and food but you\u2019ve seriously crossed the line when a five year old can\u2019t comfortably ask for cake on her birthday! how many times have you talked down to her and shamed not only your step daughter but your own children for simply wanting a treat! \n\nYTA", "YTA fat shaming a 6yr old wtf!! Apparently you bully your own children too.", "YTA.

I\u2019m now in therapy battling an eating disorder.\n\nYTA. It\u2019s one day a year, chill out.", "YTA. Some cake on her birthday wouldn\u2019t have been as damaging as you think it would be. That shaming and guilting you\u2019re doing around her and your kids\u2019 food choices could give them lasting and unhealthy relationships with food and give them eating disorders.", "YTA. Of course she would say what you wanted to hear. You said moderation. How is cake on a birthday not moderation? Get a grip", "YTA. this sounds like a perfect recipe for children with eating disorders, which is by far less healthy than any \u201ctreat\u201d food.", "YTA. Congrats on giving all the kids eating disorders and body image issues.", "If you were so concerned, you could have figured out how to bake a special dessert (cake) using healthier ingredients (less sugar, etc).

Healthy eating is about moderation - which means the poor child gets a bloody birthday cake!", ">Also FYI, the good choice/ bad choice talk is just going to give her body image issues for the rest of her life.\n\nThis. The poor child is 5-years-old. OP needs to just stop commenting on her stepdaughter's diet, period. Just based on OP's attitude here, I'm worried this little girl is going to develop an ED by her pre-teens. I can absolutely understand why the Mom was furious. Dad needs to step up and set some hard boundaries with his wife.", "Being 20lbs overweight that young is already going to cause body image issues.", "Gwen's mom should have said this exact thing when calling out OP on the birthday cake. \"Would you like to make a better parenting choice?\"", "I don\u2019t understand why she has this food in the pantry if she\u2019s going to be a creep about it with the kids when they want to eat it.

YTA especially because you\u2019re setting a 6YO for a lifetime of eating disorders and body dysmorphia. Given her age, you should bring it up with your husband, his ex, and the girl\u2019s pediatrician. You can choose what you buy for the household on a regular basis (I grew up with the rule of \u201cmilk, juice, or water\u201d for almost every beverage choice), but birthdays are special and need to be treated as such. You could have controlled the situation by controlling the portion size (opt for small cake slices or mini cupcakes for everyone). Do you tell your bio kids that they need to choose a healthier choice on their birthdays?", "She\u2019s 6 FFS and it was her bday. What a monster.

We all know they do and the step daughter will definitely remember this when she watches her step brother blow out candles.  Every.  Year.  If she even gets to go to their parties.  \n\nOP, YTA and even the six year old knows it.", "Not to mention (I\u2019m sure) going to her friends\u2019 birthday parties and seeing they get normal cake. Not only is this poor girl going to have body image issues her whole life, but her boys are going to rebel when they get older. Hell, they probably have candy bars hidden in their rooms as we speak.", "My goodness the OP is a walking advertisement for either her or someone in her family developing a eating disorder. There is the obvious fat phobia here but also the obvious need for control. OP please get therapy to figure out why food is such a control trigger for you before it\u2019s too late and your children and their half sibling are scarred by it.", "Can you explain how I am encouraging poor food choices?", "She\u2019s definitely a bully. At first I thought she was talking about the mother then realized she was talking about the 5 year old. Evil woman", "yeah she\u2019s \u201cgetting it\u201d, if getting it was an eating disorder.", "I agree OP is TA, birthday cakes on birthdays are a good thing, but...\n\n>You could also be impairing her relationship with food.\n\nThe child has an unhealthy relationship with unhealthy food.

Exhausting.", "It\u2019s 100% a power trip", "YTA - for your post above and your ridiculous policing of a 6-year old on her birthday. \n\nYTA - again for pretending that low-fat food choices are healthy. They are not.

You are not listening to what people are telling you. YTA and you are going to ruin her self-confidence and self-worth. She is 6.

You are 100% guilt tripping all of your children. That's a very unhealthy way to grow up, emotionally.", "You sound so much like my mom. She has an eating disorder from being overweight during her childhood. She passed that down to me and my sister by massively overcorrecting in the other direction. If you don't want your kid to \"choose\" something, then don't make it an option. Keep it out of your house. Do not shame a child for picking what they want by insinuating that they're consistently making the wrong choice. It causes them to doubt themselves, causes them to be embarrassed for making the \"wrong\" choice, and it's manipulative. You either make time to prepare \"acceptable\" snacks, or you shut up and let them grab what they want, but do not play head games with them.", "Have you actually looked into how terrible any low-fat food is? Has your pediatrician advised you to give low-fat food to a 6 year old? Geezus OP...", "Low fat, low sugar ice cream is not a better choice than cake nutritionally. It\u2019s all junk food. So you hurt this little girl\u2019s feelings on her birthday for no good reason. \n\nTeaching children moderation, not restriction, works better in the long term. Don\u2019t have processed junk in the house if you want healthy kids. A banana or apple is just as easy as goldfish if you\u2019re grabbing a snack. It\u2019s fine to give her choices, but set her up for success by having a variety of healthful choices available instead of guilt tripping her. \n\nWith that said, cake on her birthday, special treats, and moderation are key to healthy eating. A pizza night or a fast food stop every once in awhile won\u2019t kill anyone.

I developed anorexia. A disorder I will have to battle my whole life. Even while in recovery.  \n\nIf you're really that concerned about her health, maybe try teaching her to listen to her body.

Teaching about eating in moderation and portion control is a much healthier way. Let the little girl have cake, but a normal sized serving. Or get cupcakes. I especially love the mini-cupcakes for my tiny humans.\n\nAs someone who still struggles with a healthy mentality towards eating due to behaviors such as yours, I strongly encourage you to seek out a nutritionist that specializes in children.
