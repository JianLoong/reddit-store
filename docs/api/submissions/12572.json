It made me incredibly uncomfortable to see those things on things meant for my newborn baby. \n\nShe asked what I thought while laughing and I said that I think she's a creep for giving me things like that to put on an infant and she should be ashamed of herself for what she did. She stopped laughing and kinda just stared at me for a bit before getting up and leaving the party.\n\nA couple hours later I started getting messages from my cousin telling me that it was hateful what I said to her and that I was being a bitch for jokes. She made a post about it on Facebook and people are in the replies saying that I'm blowing it out of proportion and am being a dick for what I had to say to her. That it was harmless and was just supposed to make me laugh.\n\nPart of me feels like maybe I was just overreacting and like I should feel bad for what I said.

I get that it was most likely supposed to be a gag gift of some kind, but with gag gifts and jokes comes knowing your target audience. So I can see how for someone who wouldn\u2019t have that kind of humor to find it creepy and gross, and it\u2019s completely fine for you to have reacted the way you did. I do think upon hearing about how it made you feel, she should have apologized and explained that those onesies were meant to just be a gag gift and that she didn\u2019t expect you to keep them.

This is why she laughed at it. To all the \"she's sexualizing a child\" folks in here, these onesies were clearly never intended to be put on the child.

Also, depending on who was at the shower, opening a gift like that could be super awkward (I'm picturing having to explain to my grandma what they mean). Plus, your cousin sucks for calling you a b and blasting you on FB.\n\nThat said, it sounds like you overreacted. It seems like she got you a lot of really thoughtful things too. Saying something like \"Well I loved everything else you got us\" would've gotten the point across without calling her names. \n\nBecause honestly, once you call someone a name like creep and tell them they should be ashamed of themselves, you've lost them. \"I'm uncomfortable with what's written on the onesies\" gets your point across without making your cousin feel defensive.", "NTA.

If these had been gifted in private, I think it could have been laughed off as a gross joke, but she gifted these things in front of everyone at a baby shower! She then asked you for your thoughts, in front of everyone?? That pushes this into NTA territory for me. She clearly wanted a reaction, but didn't get the laugh she was expecting for her vulgar gag gifts, and probably feels pretty embarrassed so she's trying to turn this on you, instead of just admitting it was an inappropriate thing to do at a baby shower.\n\nIf this was my cousin, and she sincerely apologized for misreading a situation and making a poor taste joke, I'd forgive her tbh, but yeah. Pretty wild that she thought those were appropriate to gift at a baby shower. \n\nCongrats on your baby! Hopefully this just blows over for you!", "NTA.

It sounds like your cousin gave some thoughtful actual gifts and then a couple of weird onesies that they thought were funny and you didn't.\n\nDifferent people have different senses of humor, different tastes. Some people are awkward as hell. Some people give bad gifts.\n\nIf you didn't find it funny, that's totally reasonable (I think it sounds trashy and gross as well). But you didn't have to humiliate your cousin in front of everyone at the party. Personally I would say just ignore it and donate/trash the clothes, or if you feel the need you could talk to your cousin privately about it and thank them for the other gifts.", "INFO: Was this intended as a gag gift?\n\nIf it's a gag gift I think ESH cuz the gift is gross but your reaction is too much to a bad joke. However if it was a real gift thinking your child would use it NTA.", "NTA.", "YTA. \nIt's obviously just a joke. Everyone out here throwing a fit.\n\nNow, my kid wouldn't wear these obviously, but I'd still find it very humorous.", "NTA, at my baby shower we received several onesies with inappropriate wording, they went right to the trash bin as soon as the party ended.

I also find it disgusting when people make cutie pie/cream pie jokes about their babies. \n\nAlso, given that you are in a same-gender marriage, it would be statistically unlikely that your pregnancy is the result of sexual intercourse (unless your wife is a fertile trans woman, in which case, disregard), which makes some of the innuendos also inaccurate.\n\nYour cousin is feeling rightfully gross about herself after you rightfully called her a creep for giving you creepy, gross items. Ignore her and all her Facebook flying monkeys. And use those onesies at spit-up cloths.", "*tsk* it\u2019s only a joke if everyone\u2019s laughing, otherwise, it\u2019s harassment. Stupid people gotta stop being stupid, then embarrassed that they are so stupid. NTA.", "NTA, these jokes are tasteless, trashy and honestly just downright disgusting and you\u2019re allowed to be in your feelings about them. Whether they\u2019re meant to be a joke or not, sexual jokes about children are over the line and when someone who is supposed to be an adult can\u2019t see that, that\u2019s a them problem, not a you problem. This whole situation just seems uncomfortable, I\u2019m sorry that this moment of celebration was ruined for you.", "NTA. These onesies are in poor taste, imo. Regardless, the \"joke\" wasn't funny to you as the recipient of the onesies. Gag gifts are like pranks, if it lands and the recipient laughs, great! If no one is laughing, you went too far and need to apologize. \n\nAlso, sexualizing babies is gross. I'd take pics of the onesies and respond to her SM post with the pics. I'd go so far as to offer them to anyone willing to dress their child in them. I'd bet that will shut most people up", "NTA\n\nI don't even need to explain", "NTA\n\nI find those onesies trashy. But even if I thought they were funny, I\u2019d be making 1000% sure the recipient didn\u2019t find them trashy before gifting them at a baby shower.", "Was she giving them because she wanted you to laugh and either toss them, or regift them as a likewise \"Bahaha, not really. Just pass it on and keep the joke going.\" Style thing? \n\nI never have encountered them in the wild, it's like a gag gift. \n\n\"Happy 18th man! Here's a condom and a plastic sheep! Bahaha!\" \n\nYou laugh, your friend gets a little embarrassed, but you gave em otherwise fine gifts for the occasion, edit; beyond the gags, of course.", "NTA - it would be one thing if the onesie said \u201cOne day I\u2019ll demand a pony\u201d (which I honestly got for my daughter) or \u201cone day I\u2019ll have a hairy chest \u201c because those are hahaha funny but to sexualize them is so wrong on so many levels", "NTA. \n\nThat type of \u201cgift\u201d is for people that you KNOW indulge in that brand of humor. \n\nIt\u2019s gross to put that on a onesie!\n\nIt\u2019s terrible that everyone else is gaslighting you. \nYour cousin is full of shit and probably just embarrassed that their \u201cjoke\u201d wasn\u2019t well received. \n\nThey bought baby items that have vulgarities on them, but being called a creep hurt their feelings???", "C'mon you over-reacted to a couple of items that were clearly meant in a jokingly way. Grow up! Put them in the baby keepsake box for future family laughs.", "NTA. People need to know their audience. There are things I'd say to my best friend that I wouldn't say to my sister cause I know that one will laugh and the other one will be offended. Either your cousin doesn't know you very well or she messed up big time cause some people would take it as a gag gift (seeing how there were other gifts as well) whilst others would take it personally. \n\nIn my opinion, there are no AH's in this scenario, just people with a differing sense of humour. Congrats on the baby!", "NTA. I feel like your cousin doesn't really know you/get your sense of humor if she thought that was in any way appropriate. I'd be more likely to shoot back with \"Do you even know me at all? What part of me and my sense of humor made you think I'd be okay with crass, inappropriate, *sexual* references on the attire of my goddamn baby that I'm currently carrying inside me? Be more mad at yourself for not knowing me at all than being offended that I think your sense of humor is trash.\"", "NTA. Those sayings are incredibly inappropriate. Congrats to you and your wife on your baby.", "NTA", ">Obviously that's how the baby came to be.. but seriously\n\nOP has a wife, even if one thinks those kind of jokes are funny, a lot of them won't even land in this case.", ">\"Was Almost Swallowed\"\n\nI thought this was fine, if somewhat random. I was thinking Jonah / whale kinda thing.\n\nAnd then I realized what it meant. Ugh.", "Thank god I'm not the only one who didn't quite get it, but I knew it was along those lines...just kinda gross for a baby...yeah it was a joke...not a funny one.", "Honestly, I feel like if they weren't intended to be worn, that makes it worse. Because that means she just wasted money, material and production resources on multiple onesies that function perfectly well but are intended only for landfill. What an incredible waste!", "I can see myself gifting my brother with something like a \"Daddy's favourite accident\" onesie, but that's as far as I'd ever be comfortable with going and I know for a fact he'd find it funny, he's a degenerate. That'd also obviously never be put on a child", "Ikr? When I think of gag gift onesies I think of 'storm pooper', 'eat sleep poop repeat', or even 'boobie monster' if you know the mom well enough to know she might try breastfeeding. \n\nBut .. almost swallowed, to a LESBIAN COUPLE?!?? That's just plain weird and insensitive. And the backbreaker, I don't even know what that means. Although admittedly I'm not a native English speaker.\n\nNTA. \nCousin should have thought more about what she gave as gag gifts.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been to a baby shower where those kinds of jokes would go over well with most of the room. Even some who might laugh at them in a different situation aren\u2019t comfortable with those kinds of jokes in front of their grandma or aunt or whatever. I think they\u2019re awful and a waste no matter what but it\u2019s making OP first see them at her shower with family present that really brings it to AH territory.", "Some people don't like certain jokes. If they joked like this normally, it would be fine but it seemed very out of the ordinary. OP is NTA for not understanding a gag gift. It's not her fault for not having the same humor. Plus you're forgetting OP is pregnant so emotions can be exaggerated or different than if she weren't. Maybe she would've found them funny if not so stressed out or if it were someone else's baby shower, idk but this isn't a \"someone has to be the AH\" post", "Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the cousin has a Cricut or similar and made them herself.", "Nah I thought the same as OP, especially as someone who can't afford to waste clothes.", "So you're supposed to, what, just throw it out afterwards? Why get a \"gift\" if it's gonna be (or not) laughed at for two seconds before being discarded and never seen again. Also idk bout you but majority of people usually take the time to know their audience when it comes to giving baby gifts, especially when they look like what OP got. NTA. Weird ass \"gift\".", "Pretty sure the cousin missed the mark on this one. That\u2019s definitely just a trashy thing to put on a baby and you\u2019re assuming some intent here by saying they\u2019re obviously meant to be thrown away", ">They were clearly placed as a reactionary gag with no intent of them ever being put on a child.\n\nOh right. So just a waste of money and materials destined for landfill then? Wow that makes it so much better...", "Oh also congratulations OP. My due date is May and I'm also hella scared of labor. So know ur not alone \ud83d\ude05", "Eeewwww WTF is wrong with your cousin?", "I assumed it was a dig at feminists.", "I thought it meant carrying a baby hurts your back. Wtf is wrong with you holy shit lol.", "Right?! Like why are people saying this makes it ok?", "I did it unmedicated. It was rough. Definitely not an easy day and I nearly got the epidural but luckily labor progressed quickly enough that I was able to not get it. I really wanted to go unmedicated but that was how I felt and literally none of my friends who had babies were unmedicated so it\u2019s totally OK whatever you choose.\n\nIt took me months to heal, which is normal but then you hear about the women who took 4 weeks and feel like you\u2019ll never get there. You do! Just trust your body and get a physical therapy referral as soon as you can and do your PT consistently. Getting those lower and upper abs to work in tandem again takes time! And who knows you might be one of the women who dont tear at all and are good to go in six weeks.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t taken a class or looked into pre labor stretches, I\u2019d do that. It\u2019s nothing strenuous just things to stretch your hips and lower body. The Bradley method has some if you need help getting started.", "Similar to the other commenter, I had an unmedicated vaginal delivery last August. Everything happened too fast for an epidural, which I had planned on having because I was also afraid of how much it would hurt. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it does hurt. I actually found the contractions were the worst part, the ring of fire as the head comes out isn't exactly pleasant but your body really does just take over and there isn't much time to focus on the pain.  I ended up with 3rd degree tearing, even tore the butthole muscle. I was left there for 6 hours soaking in my blood before they bothered to stitch me up and I wasn't in any pain. \n\nIf it helps, I'd 100% do an unmedicated delivery the same way if given the opportunity, so it wasn't all bad. It was empowering and honestly, felt so hardcore. And the relief afterwards was instant. Literally all pain just went back to 0 as soon as my son flopped out. \n\nYou got this OP! I wish you a safe and healthy pregnancy and delivery, no matter how baby makes their arrival.", "I've had a natural birth, a c-section, and two epidural births. I definitely recommend the epidural. \n\nCongratulations, babies are awesome!", "Okay, I get why you find the gift distasteful and you\u2019re totally justified in that\u2026\n\nBut everything you\u2019ve described totally sounds like a gag gift. \n\nThis past year my mom had a few books she wanted for Christmas. I got those books for her and put them in a box, but at the bottom of the box I also put a last book that was loosely in the same genre but very obviously not her cup of tea. So she opens the box, is happy to see the real gifts she wanted, then gets to the bottom of the box for an off kilter surprise. Everyone gets a laugh, and she may very well throw out the last book, but that\u2019s expected and I don\u2019t mind. I didn\u2019t buy the book for the sake of wanting her to read it, I was just buying the laughs associated with it.\n\nI prefer doing gag gifts like that, rather then giving them the gag gift first in a separate box to try to prank them into thinking it\u2019s the real gift, and THEN surprising them with the actual gift. That way feels a little more mean spirited.", "You\u2019re a bad ass", "Maybe edit your comment before you get banned for referencing v*ol*nce", "it's 2023 and you still use bing?", "Back breaker definitely is a sex term thing. Slang doesn't usually come up in search results for me, but I did find it on google after elaborating on context. \n\nI would be confused to if it wasn't common slang regarding to sex where I'm from.", "You entertain a mixed room of 70ish people with reddit posts? Hahahahahahaha", "By that logic, there's a mixed bunch of people right here in the comments and a majority of them don't find it funny.", "If your personality is being a creep towards + sexualizing babies and children then I can see why nobody wants to have it", "Found the cousin. \n\nAs an aside, you need to work on your \"humor\". I can appreciate a good joke like most anyone, but this ain't it. OP is NTA.", "Huh, that\u2019s weird. I\u2019m reading this sub to a mixed room of 80ish people and none of us thought it was funny. Guess you\u2019re wrong?", "Bro how fucking lame do you have to be to be reading Reddit posts to people live at a party", "70ish people at the VFW hall potluck? Only people laughing at that joke have the bluest of hair", "I gotta ask\u2026 what kinda event has 70ish people who would listen to one person read a AITA post off of reddit?", "well looks like almost 300 people disagree so far :D", "I think we found the cousin.", "she obviously did misjudge considering the reaction\u2026", "If that\u2019s the case that should have been a one on one gift, not something to be opened at a party.", "You'd be surprised. Also, Microsoft have introduced a new chatbot AI that makes the whole search process very interactive and interesting. Not saying that's what the person above did, but I and many others have been lured into using Bing once in a while -- the chat function being a major reason for me. And I NEVER used Bing in the past.", "Yeah from an african country everyone knows what that means...", "They don\u2019t have a personality of their own.", "damn are you up on a stage? wtf is happening where you ended up reading reddit aloud to 70 people? guarantee you most of them are just laughing politely", "*Oh all 70 people in my room think it's so funny to make sexual jokes towards a literal fucking baby* \n\nYou and all the 70 people are fucking creeps that should stay away from babies", "Totally. And they all clapped too.", "Are you entertaining inmates in jail?", "I have a really immature sense of humour, like i still have a little giggle when 69 randomly pops up in my life. Having said that, I fail to see the humour in this. \n\nLike why is something that says backbreaker or I almost swallowed (on a kids onesie) funny? Because they had sex and made a baby? Not to mention, why would you think the appropriate time to give a gag gift like this is at a baby shower?", "The event can\u2019t be very fun if they\u2019re reading Reddit aloud AND taking the time to make the same comments multiple times on the same post \ud83d\udc80", "You're in a room w 70 people, 60 of whom are children and you are reading them all a reddit post about adult phrases on a newborn onsie?", "And also grows shrooms.", "And using it as a point when the 60 kids go haha sex funny? They are kids with a very immature sense of humour because they themselves aren\u2019t mature"]}
