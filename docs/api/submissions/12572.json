I get that it was most likely supposed to be a gag gift of some kind, but with gag gifts and jokes comes knowing your target audience. So I can see how for someone who wouldn\u2019t have that kind of humor to find it creepy and gross, and it\u2019s completely fine for you to have reacted the way you did. I do think upon hearing about how it made you feel, she should have apologized and explained that those onesies were meant to just be a gag gift and that she didn\u2019t expect you to keep them.

Plus, your cousin sucks for calling you a b and blasting you on FB.\n\nThat said, it sounds like you overreacted. It seems like she got you a lot of really thoughtful things too. Saying something like \"Well I loved everything else you got us\" would've gotten the point across without calling her names. \n\nBecause honestly, once you call someone a name like creep and tell them they should be ashamed of themselves, you've lost them. \"I'm uncomfortable with what's written on the onesies\" gets your point across without making your cousin feel defensive.", "NTA.

If these had been gifted in private, I think it could have been laughed off as a gross joke, but she gifted these things in front of everyone at a baby shower!

She clearly wanted a reaction, but didn't get the laugh she was expecting for her vulgar gag gifts, and probably feels pretty embarrassed so she's trying to turn this on you, instead of just admitting it was an inappropriate thing to do at a baby shower.\n\nIf this was my cousin, and she sincerely apologized for misreading a situation and making a poor taste joke, I'd forgive her tbh, but yeah.

Some people are awkward as hell. Some people give bad gifts.\n\nIf you didn't find it funny, that's totally reasonable (I think it sounds trashy and gross as well). But you didn't have to humiliate your cousin in front of everyone at the party. Personally I would say just ignore it and donate/trash the clothes, or if you feel the need you could talk to your cousin privately about it and thank them for the other gifts.", "INFO: Was this intended as a gag gift?\n\nIf it's a gag gift I think ESH cuz the gift is gross but your reaction is too much to a bad joke.

Regardless, the \"joke\" wasn't funny to you as the recipient of the onesies. Gag gifts are like pranks, if it lands and the recipient laughs, great! If no one is laughing, you went too far and need to apologize. \n\nAlso, sexualizing babies is gross. I'd take pics of the onesies and respond to her SM post with the pics.

There are things I'd say to my best friend that I wouldn't say to my sister cause I know that one will laugh and the other one will be offended.

Definitely not an easy day and I nearly got the epidural but luckily labor progressed quickly enough that I was able to not get it. I really wanted to go unmedicated but that was how I felt and literally none of my friends who had babies were unmedicated so it\u2019s totally OK whatever you choose.\n\nIt took me months to heal, which is normal but then you hear about the women who took 4 weeks and feel like you\u2019ll never get there. You do! Just trust your body and get a physical therapy referral as soon as you can and do your PT consistently. Getting those lower and upper abs to work in tandem again takes time! And who knows you might be one of the women who dont tear at all and are good to go in six weeks.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t taken a class or looked into pre labor stretches, I\u2019d do that. It\u2019s nothing strenuous just things to stretch your hips and lower body. The Bradley method has some if you need help getting started.", "Similar to the other commenter, I had an unmedicated vaginal delivery last August. Everything happened too fast for an epidural, which I had planned on having because I was also afraid of how much it would hurt. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it does hurt. I actually found the contractions were the worst part, the ring of fire as the head comes out isn't exactly pleasant but your body really does just take over and there isn't much time to focus on the pain.  I ended up with 3rd degree tearing, even tore the butthole muscle. I was left there for 6 hours soaking in my blood before they bothered to stitch me up and I wasn't in any pain. \n\nIf it helps, I'd 100% do an unmedicated delivery the same way if given the opportunity, so it wasn't all bad. It was empowering and honestly, felt so hardcore. And the relief afterwards was instant. Literally all pain just went back to 0 as soon as my son flopped out. \n\nYou got this OP!

I got those books for her and put them in a box, but at the bottom of the box I also put a last book that was loosely in the same genre but very obviously not her cup of tea. So she opens the box, is happy to see the real gifts she wanted, then gets to the bottom of the box for an off kilter surprise. Everyone gets a laugh, and she may very well throw out the last book, but that\u2019s expected and I don\u2019t mind. I didn\u2019t buy the book for the sake of wanting her to read it, I was just buying the laughs associated with it.\n\nI prefer doing gag gifts like that, rather then giving them the gag gift first in a separate box to try to prank them into thinking it\u2019s the real gift, and THEN surprising them with the actual gift.

I\u2019m from Scotland and quite a lot of us have a very dry/dark/sarcastic humour so I have never had an issue here but when I lived in America there were a few times I said something that back home would have brought laughter however there it made people audibly gasp. When it did happen you have to just apologise profusely and explain it was a joke but you crossed the line and accept that someone else was offended or hurt by it and make that right. Fact of the matter is that the gifts were inappropriate and she maybe thought it was funny, maybe you are a bit stressed and hormonal and one day it will be something you laugh about but it makes no difference! As soon as she knew that she upset you she should have owned it an apologised when she realised the joke didn\u2019t hit the mark.\nIf you want to use adult humour then you have to be grown up enough to be accountable if others find it too much.
