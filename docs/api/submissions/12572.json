I am nervous, overwhelmed, and very scared. I may have taking it out on my cousin for a harmless joke like some people are saying but my wife and parents are taking my side so I'm not too sure if I'm in the wrong.\n\nA couple days ago I had a baby shower. Everything was going great until it got to the gifts. My cousin handed me a big box with various baby things in it. Everything looked adorable until I got to the bottom of the box.\n\nAt the bottom of the box was onesies that said...inappropriate things. Things ranging from \"Future Backbreaker\" to \"Was Almost Swallowed\" was written on the onesies in big bold letters. It made me incredibly uncomfortable to see those things on things meant for my newborn baby. \n\nShe asked what I thought while laughing and I said that I think she's a creep for giving me things like that to put on an infant and she should be ashamed of herself for what she did. She stopped laughing and kinda just stared at me for a bit before getting up and leaving the party.\n\nA couple hours later I started getting messages from my cousin telling me that it was hateful what I said to her and that I was being a bitch for jokes. She made a post about it on Facebook and people are in the replies saying that I'm blowing it out of proportion and am being a dick for what I had to say to her. That it was harmless and was just supposed to make me laugh.\n\nPart of me feels like maybe I was just overreacting and like I should feel bad for what I said. Maybe that it was just in the moment and the pregnancy hormones and anxiety are making me react to certain things in a bad way? I just don't understand how anyone could find those things funny. \n\nAITA for how I reacted and what I said?", "created_utc": 1679117403, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ufgr0/aita_for_calling_my_cousin_a_creep_at_my_baby/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

TBH, I'm not sure how I would have reacted in the moment because I would have been so shocked. I think your reaction was completely justified.

Then again I\u2019ve always had a twisted sense of humor thanks to having an older brother (I am a woman, by the way).\n\nBut I do have to agree with the majority here and say NTA. I get that it was most likely supposed to be a gag gift of some kind, but with gag gifts and jokes comes knowing your target audience. So I can see how for someone who wouldn\u2019t have that kind of humor to find it creepy and gross, and it\u2019s completely fine for you to have reacted the way you did. I do think upon hearing about how it made you feel, she should have apologized and explained that those onesies were meant to just be a gag gift and that she didn\u2019t expect you to keep them. (Because while *I* would have found them hilarious, I wouldn\u2019t put them on my baby because I know they definitely aren\u2019t appropriate for actually wearing around, just meant to make me laugh.) But instead she blew it up on Facebook and acted like an actual baby about it, which we all know is something nobody should ever do unless they wanna get ratioed.\n\nAll that aside, congrats on the baby!!!", "NTA \n\nYou called her out for doing such a distasteful, totally classless act. She could have just said \"I'm so sorry. I guess I didn't think.\" Block her on FB. You don't need to be reading what her followers are saying. You must think about your beautiful baby coming. Babies in the womb need positive vibes. Congratulations on your soon to be born baby!!", "NTA. She's sexualising a baby. A BABY. Little is creepier than that.", "NTA. Boy oh boy do I wish people would stop sexualizing *literal fucking infants*.", "nta. this is awful and disgusting. and based on the fact that youre both females, the second onesie makes no sense and is not funny.", "NTA. If the two of you have a relationship based on humor and she legitimately thought you'd enjoy the joke it was not at all the right context for it.", "YTA it's a joke gift.

If your joke doesn't land apologize and either remove yourself or move on. Don't go on Facebook and judge someone for not finding *an extremely niche joke* funny. And only people with very twisted senses of humor would find such a tasteless joke funny, especially when at a baby shower for their own child. Mixed in with the serious gifts like it was a legitimate gift and not a gag gift at that.", "YTA - She gave a ton of actual gifts then put reactionary gifts in the bottom, clearly as a gag. This is why she laughed at it. To all the \"she's sexualizing a child\" folks in here, these onesies were clearly never intended to be put on the child. This is why the rest of the gifts (assuming from a registry (chime in op)) were on top. Overreaction to a joke.", "I'm going with ESH. The onesies are gross. Even if I thought the mom-to-be would find them hilarious, I wouldn't buy them for her. Also, depending on who was at the shower, opening a gift like that could be super awkward (I'm picturing having to explain to my grandma what they mean). Plus, your cousin sucks for calling you a b and blasting you on FB.\n\nThat said, it sounds like you overreacted. It seems like she got you a lot of really thoughtful things too. Saying something like \"Well I loved everything else you got us\" would've gotten the point across without calling her names. \n\nBecause honestly, once you call someone a name like creep and tell them they should be ashamed of themselves, you've lost them. \"I'm uncomfortable with what's written on the onesies\" gets your point across without making your cousin feel defensive.", "NTA. I don't think you were overreacting at all.", "NTA. If these had been gifted in private, I think it could have been laughed off as a gross joke, but she gifted these things in front of everyone at a baby shower! She then asked you for your thoughts, in front of everyone?? That pushes this into NTA territory for me. She clearly wanted a reaction, but didn't get the laugh she was expecting for her vulgar gag gifts, and probably feels pretty embarrassed so she's trying to turn this on you, instead of just admitting it was an inappropriate thing to do at a baby shower.\n\nIf this was my cousin, and she sincerely apologized for misreading a situation and making a poor taste joke, I'd forgive her tbh, but yeah. Pretty wild that she thought those were appropriate to gift at a baby shower. \n\nCongrats on your baby! Hopefully this just blows over for you!", "NTA. She's a creep and should be ashamed of herself.", "NTA \n\nWhile she is not either for the initial gift, just really tacky for an inappropriate gift that she clearly didn't read the room for. She is completely the A for how she doubled down afterwards.", "I'm going against the rest and saying YTA here. It sounds like your cousin gave some thoughtful actual gifts and then a couple of weird onesies that they thought were funny and you didn't.\n\nDifferent people have different senses of humor, different tastes. Some people are awkward as hell. Some people give bad gifts.\n\nIf you didn't find it funny, that's totally reasonable (I think it sounds trashy and gross as well). But you didn't have to humiliate your cousin in front of everyone at the party. Personally I would say just ignore it and donate/trash the clothes, or if you feel the need you could talk to your cousin privately about it and thank them for the other gifts.", "INFO: Was this intended as a gag gift?\n\nIf it's a gag gift I think ESH cuz the gift is gross but your reaction is too much to a bad joke. However if it was a real gift thinking your child would use it NTA.", "NTA.", "YTA. \nIt's obviously just a joke. Everyone out here throwing a fit.\n\nNow, my kid wouldn't wear these obviously, but I'd still find it very humorous.", "NTA, at my baby shower we received several onesies with inappropriate wording, they went right to the trash bin as soon as the party ended. It\u2019s not funny to begin with, but when the butt of it can\u2019t even choose what they\u2019re wearing, that\u2019s just wrong as hell. \n\nYou were not overreacting in the least, hopefully you steer clear of them in the future, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be happy to make your life miserable because you \u201ccouldn\u2019t take a joke\u201d", "NTA. Even if it was given to be discarded. Even if it was meant to be a gag gift it is incredibly gross to sexualize a baby. I have a dark, messed up sense of humor and I would NEVER do that.
