I got together with my ex when we were 17, got the tattoo when we were 18, stayed together with Rory for 3 years, then broke up, and now, after another 3 years, we\u2019re still friends. So it never really occurred to me to do anything about the tattoo, it means a lot to me. (nothing special though, just a triangle with 3 dots inside, representing the 3 of us. No one would ever guess what it is. All of us have it on the back of our legs.)\n\nI got together with my current boyfriend (24M) a few months ago, and I made it clear from the start that I\u2019m still friends with my ex and nothing is going to change that. I see him about 2-3 times per year because he moved to a different country, so it shouldn\u2019t cause much of an issue anyway.\n\nSo my boyfriend, let\u2019s call him Edward, was very chill about this, so I agreed to actually get together instead of just dating. Fast forward to a week ago, he noticed the tattoo on the back of my leg and asked if it had any meaning, so I told him the 3 dots are me, April, and Rory, and we all have the same one. Hearing this Edward got super upset, and after a heated argument he told me if I truly loved him I would immediately get it either removed or covered up. \n\nNow there is absolutely no way I\u2019m doing that, and I told him so. We haven\u2019t talked since, and I\u2019m honestly starting to question whether I\u2019m in the right for wanting to keep my only tattoo as it is. I love Edward, but it doesn\u2019t sit right with me to remove something important to me just so he\u2019d stay with me. I also don\u2019t understand why it made him so upset, since he knew I\u2019m still friends with Rory.\n\nHe refuses to talk to me now, until I \u201cget that thing removed\u201d. I told him he was being pathetic, and to think this through again. We\u2019re still not talking and it\u2019s either I get an appointment or we break up, he won\u2019t change his mind.

LOL you can do better", "NTA, it's 3 dots in a triangle. It's not like you have your ex's name tattooed across your chest and frankly, even if you did its your body, your choice. He sounds incredibly insecure and controlling.", "NTA. It sounds like the problem solved itself. Don't stay with controlling jerks. You've been given a gift before you wasted more time.", "Definitely NTA!\n\nHun this is a HUUUUUGE red flag. The universe has given you a sign. Say thanks and run. \n\nIf you give in to him on this it\u2019ll just encourage further controlling behaviour. When someone shows you who they are believe them! \n\nStay strong. All the best!", "NTA, he\u2019s only been your partner for a few months?? cut your losses and dump him, if he\u2019s that insecure over a friendship tattoo then who knows what other red flags he\u2019s got lying in wait.", "NTA. It is not fair for your boyfriend to demand that you get rid of a tattoo that has significant meaning to you just because he is jealous of your past relationship with your ex. It is your body and your decision whether or not to keep the tattoo. Edward knew about your friendship with your ex from the start and it is unfair for him to change the rules now. It is also concerning that he is giving you an ultimatum like this. If he truly loves and respects you, he should be able to accept you for who you are, tattoo and all.", "NTA. If he truly loved you, he would understand that the tattoo is part of your life history and be understanding. Demanding that you remove it and not talking to you is a real controlling move. Is this the kind of relationship you want?", "NTA. Sounds like a sweet tattoo that holds meaning for you. You don\u2019t need to stay with someone who tries to control you.", "NTA. What other demands will he make or else he will not talk to you until you do what he wants? The list is endless. This is the first step in a very abusive situation. Isolation. His first instinct is to eliminate your past. That's not healthy.", "NTA\nThis is a major red flag. Dump him and move on.", "NTA. \n\nJust be happy you didn\u2019t get a tattoo with this soon to be ex-boyfriend. You\u2019d already be regretting that one.", "NTA, it sounds like he\u2019s jealous and controlling", "NTA - The tattoo has a meaning for you \nHe is jealous , you can find someone better", "NTA. You are not in the wrong for wanting to keep an important friendship tattoo, but he is also not in the wrong for being uncomfortable with it. However, he is in the wrong for trying to force you to remove it, especially after only a few months of dating.", "Absolutely NTA, this is a giant red flag, please move on", "NTA.\n\nHere is what you do--point to his penis and ask \"did that touch your ex-GF??\"  Yes?? Then you have to have it surgically removed.  Then tell him you'll schedule the tattoo removal for the week after the penis removal.  :)", "NTA. Dude needs to grow up.", "NTA. Break up.", "NTA for multiple reasons. \n\nFirst, it's a friendship tattoo, not your exs name or anything. And unless April regularly got in on the fun, it shouldn't be seen as anything more than that.\n\nSecond, your current BF has some real insecurities. Yall are young but not young enough to not expect an SO to have artifacts from previous relationships. \n\nThird, yall have been together for a few months. He has no leg to stand on telling you to remove a tattoo. MAYBE if you're still together at 30 you can circle back to this. \n\nFourth, again yall are young. This is just a silly argument. In reality you might not be together for the long haul. And I wouldn't be doing body mods for someone I want 100% sure of and put years in together. \n\nInfo: What is his stance on tattoos? Like does he have a religious aversion to them or something? (Not that this would make it ok)\n\nMaybe a comprise would be to get a tattoo together? But I wouldn't do anything with names or anything easily attached to that person. Maybe something to do with a common interest you share. \nFor example, my wife and I are planning on getting matching rat tattoos.", "I think it\u2019s unreasonable for Edward to ask that you remove it. I also think it may have been better if you mentioned the tattoo when you mentioned that y\u2019all are still friends. I think slight ESH. \n\nMaybe edward isn\u2019t as comfortable with the friendship but also maybe it was just upsetting that you \u201chid\u201d that information from him. \n\nIf you were to apologize for not mentioning the tattoo and explain there were no ill intentions of not telling him since you see it as a friendship tattoo my judgment would change. If you explain that and he still wants you to remove it then I think it would change to N T A. If he understands and apologized for overreacting then N A H.", "NTA. The tattoo is inconspicuous. \nHowever, and this will be an unpopular opinion, the way you come across as your friendship with your ex being some sort of hill you die on is REALLY unattractive to a lot of people. \nYou already only see him like 2x a year so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re actually close anymore.\n\n\nIt was a childhood friendship and relationship.

If he can't deal with your weird friends platonic-ish threesome thing, he's not for you and that's okay. In addition, the \"if you really loved me you would...\" is SUCH a toddler thing to say.

He\u2019s massively insecure and got issues.\n\nIt\u2019s not like you have the word Rory in a huge font with a heart on it for gods sake.

You've only been together a few months and he's demanding you get a tattoo removed that doesn't even have the guy's name? Big jealousy red flag; be prepared for more jealous behavior from him .

I guarantee you if Rory came around for a visit it would cause a major issue there too.\n\nDo you have pictures of you two or mementos? More than likely if he finds them he will want you to get rid of those too. I had an ex like that.
