It is not fair for your boyfriend to demand that you get rid of a tattoo that has significant meaning to you just because he is jealous of your past relationship with your ex. It is your body and your decision whether or not to keep the tattoo. Edward knew about your friendship with your ex from the start and it is unfair for him to change the rules now. It is also concerning that he is giving you an ultimatum like this. If he truly loves and respects you, he should be able to accept you for who you are, tattoo and all.", "NTA.

Yall are young but not young enough to not expect an SO to have artifacts from previous relationships. \n\nThird, yall have been together for a few months. He has no leg to stand on telling you to remove a tattoo. MAYBE if you're still together at 30 you can circle back to this. \n\nFourth, again yall are young. This is just a silly argument.

If you explain that and he still wants you to remove it then I think it would change to N T A. If he understands and apologized for overreacting then N A H.", "NTA.
