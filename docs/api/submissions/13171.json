So it never really occurred to me to do anything about the tattoo, it means a lot to me. (nothing special though, just a triangle with 3 dots inside, representing the 3 of us. No one would ever guess what it is.

I see him about 2-3 times per year because he moved to a different country, so it shouldn\u2019t cause much of an issue anyway.\n\nSo my boyfriend, let\u2019s call him Edward, was very chill about this, so I agreed to actually get together instead of just dating. Fast forward to a week ago, he noticed the tattoo on the back of my leg and asked if it had any meaning, so I told him the 3 dots are me, April, and Rory, and we all have the same one.

It is not fair for your boyfriend to demand that you get rid of a tattoo that has significant meaning to you just because he is jealous of your past relationship with your ex. It is your body and your decision whether or not to keep the tattoo. Edward knew about your friendship with your ex from the start and it is unfair for him to change the rules now. It is also concerning that he is giving you an ultimatum like this. If he truly loves and respects you, he should be able to accept you for who you are, tattoo and all.", "NTA.

Yall are young but not young enough to not expect an SO to have artifacts from previous relationships. \n\nThird, yall have been together for a few months. He has no leg to stand on telling you to remove a tattoo. MAYBE if you're still together at 30 you can circle back to this. \n\nFourth, again yall are young. This is just a silly argument.

If you explain that and he still wants you to remove it then I think it would change to N T A. If he understands and apologized for overreacting then N A H.", "NTA. The tattoo is inconspicuous. \nHowever, and this will be an unpopular opinion, the way you come across as your friendship with your ex being some sort of hill you die on is REALLY unattractive to a lot of people. \nYou already only see him like 2x a year so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re actually close anymore.\n\n\nIt was a childhood friendship and relationship.

You need to question whether you even want to be with someone who is so controlling, or should you hold out for someone who loves you as you are and is ok with your past and your present. His response to this situation tells me he's got some major insecurity issues.", "NTA: It's only been a few months and he is showing his true colors. This is a massive red flag and he is in fact not \"chill.\" Do yourself a favor and just end it now, don't waste any time on him.", "NTA your body, your past, your choice. All of that is part of the complete package. If he can't handle it, it's not your issue.", "It took him a few months to notice a tattoo she has on her leg \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f like way to not pay attention.", "PLEASE do better! My God..", "Girl. Run.", "LEAVE HIM", "Only downside is that three dots in a triangle is a pretty common gang tattoo. I have three dots in a line tattooed on me and was asked if that was a gang tattoo due to the similarities", "This is the right answer. This guys I had news.", "Is he truly just insecure or is he controlling and this tattoo is his perfect first excuse. Sorry I'm sleepless, too cynical about everything today, and can't help but jump to extreme.", "This!!!", "Please listen to this. Your BF's behavior of not talking to you unless you do what he says is such a big red flag. \n\nNTA OP", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 this is brilliant advise, love it", "Boyfriendectomy", "Yeah I\u2019d love to know if OP has actually seen Rory since getting with her bf (especially recently and not within the very beginning of the relationship). I think BF is only \u201ccool\u201d with her being friends with her ex because it hasn\u2019t come up since he\u2019s begun to feel secure enough. \n\nHe will definitely throw a fit (probably even worse than this) the next time she tried to do anything with Rory.", "I agree with you. His reaction is out of bounds. However, I\u2019d be hurt if I was in a committed relationship with someone who failed to mention this shared tattoo. She said her bf was \u201cvery chill\u201d about her maintaining a friendship with the ex, so he doesn\u2019t seem to be overly jealous. OP should have mentioned the tattoo and her bf shouldn\u2019t try to tell her what to do with her body.", "Actually, there are few better hills to die on than maintaining your existing friendships.\n\nIf my partner tries to tell me who I can or can't be friends with, the partner is the one I'm getting rid of. I don't need somebody that insecure and controlling in my life.", "What a gross opinion, people are allowed to be friends with someone they used to fuck. I'm glad it's unattractive to some people because that easily weeds out people who are insecure and jealous. Bye!\n\nHaving friendships isn't somehing anyone needs to grow up from. The idea that the only person you should be close with is your spouse is so toxic.", "I am close friends with my Ex, we haven't seen each other in more than a year, but I know about everything important and many usual things going on in her life and vice versa; because we have other means of keeping contact than being physically close.\n\nI am also still extremely good friends with the people I was very good friends with when I was 12 and we chat daily.\n\nPeople can grow up, mature and grow as people , AND still like the people they liked when they are younger. Those are people who were okay with puberty-me and I respect them for that.", "I have a pineapple tattoo and am asked if I am a swinger all the time.", "Yes I\u2019d be hurt too, not about her having the tattoo but as you said, about her not mentioning it.", "Wait what?   I had no idea"]}
