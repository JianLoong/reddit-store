Every year, my husband, I and my siblings, and their spouses go on vacation together in late January-early February, this year was no different, we also go on vacation in July when the kids are on summer break. One of my siblings, my sister, Anna, has 2 boys, ages thirteen and ten.\n\nI love my sister and her family, but her ten-year-old, Dylan, has massive behavioral problems, including being a compulsive liar. I am friends with Dylan\u2019s teacher, as we teach in the same school and teach the same grade. I have seen Dylan\u2019s behavior at school and it truly is atrocious and can attest to everything his teacher says about his behavior. My sister however thinks his teacher is \u201cnaive\u201d and \u201cprobably easily manipulated\u201d and uses me talking about teacher burnout to justify that stance. \n\nSome of Dylan\u2019s behaviors have included stealing gifts from his older brother that one of his friends gave him to \u201cprove\u201d they traveled to the Philippines, lying about how many siblings he had, and is the poster boy of the kid who says stuff like \u201cmy dad works at Apple and I have an iPhone 15\u201d. Dylan also has an incredibly cruel streak and recently got in trouble for being mean to a boy for painting his nails. When his teacher found out about this, she questioned him and he gave a story that was provably false due to the details he gave of where people were at the time (I can verify that his story is impossible). My sister is in denial that her son is homophobic because he hasn\u2019t been mean to one of our nephews (15), who is gay. Her and her husband genuinely seem to believe that since he doesn\u2019t make any homophobic comments at home, his teacher must be \u201cfalling for other kid\u2019s propaganda\u201d.\n\nA few days ago, after we got back from the trip, my sister posted about it in a local mom\u2019s Facebook group, she went on about how the vacation was nice, but also how Dylan needed it so badly because he\u2019s \u201cmisunderstood\u201d at school and went on about how the education system is \u201ctoxic\u201d and how kids these days \u201calways lie to teachers\u201d and how Dylan is a victim of  other kid\u2019s entitlement. \n\nWhen I saw the post, I immediately called my sister and asked her to take it down, she refused just saying she was \u201cgiving her two cents on life\u201d and suggested I was being \u201cmanipulated\u201d by other kids to. I told her if she didn\u2019t take the post down, that I would not go on another family vacation and I would limit the amount of family events I went to. My sister was very upset by this and went to other family members to share, they\u2019re trying to help us \u201cwork it out\u201d and some have suggested that I\u2019m in the wrong and shouldn\u2019t be \u201cpolicing my sister\u2019s views\u201d, but others are taking a more firm stance against her. I don\u2019t know how to feel, I love my sister but I also know she holds false beliefs about her son\u2019s teacher, she seems to genuinely think he isn\u2019t lying, because \u201che knows it\u2019s safe to tell us the truth\u201d.

It's perfectly fine for you to protect your own children when your sister is completely blind to your nephew's obvious behavioral problems. I wouldn't want to take them on this vacation, either.\n\nBut it is a little strange to me that the Facebook post was what precipitated your ultimatum? And that's the hill you're going to die on? So, if she took the Facebook post down, would that make everything else okay?", "NTA\n\nThey don\u2019t think he\u2019s homophobic because they\u2019re homophobic as well, but probably think that they are not because they\u2019re not actively committing hate crimes. No one would say \u201cfalling for the other kids propaganda\u201d, unless they\u2019re homophobic", "NTA. Your sister (and her husband) is delusional. Maybe you should suggest she homeschool him since his teacher is so terrible. Sound like the parents who are shocked their precious baby committed a crime and then blame society for it.", "NTA. She can have her views, but she also must be prepared for the consequences of expressing them, which means seeing you and your kids less often.", "NTA. Your sister is in deep denial about her son's behavior and need for help. That she disparages you by association in her misguided attack on the school is unacceptable and you're right to draw a line. Have you sat her down and confronted her with the truth using facts or are you expecting her to wake up to it at some point? Because given how deep in denial she is, that point may be too late to help Dylan. Are you the only family member willing to talk to her about the need to get Dylan some help? If so, you need to enlist others to step up. At the end of the day, though, you may just need to distance yourself for your own sake. It's sad.", "NTA. \n\nOn a related note, doesn't it feel a little suffocating to take your vacations with all your siblings twice every year? Does your husband like it?", "NTA. You care about your sister thats why youre trying to make her see her twisted view. I dont think you should be limitjng the family events you attend if you and your children enjoy it though. Sounds like a punishment for you but if you really dont want to keep on being in that kind of environment, i understand. I dont wanna keep on listening to someone talking about how good their bad kid is. Also not a good example to other kids. You do you, youre fine.", "Is this kid in counseling? Probably not if his mother doesn't see a problem. \n\nNTA. She needs something to wake her up to the toxic mess she is fostering before he becomes an adult. You alone may not be enough, but it may just start her thinking.", "NTA but I'd takk with his teacher and or your principal to encourage her to refer him to the school counselor. If his behavior gets serious enough to get a plan in place maybe that will help break her denial.", "NTA\n\nBut this FB post is not the issue.\n\nDylan has untreated behavioral issues, and he lies. What is he like when on vacation? Are you OK with your 3 kids being exposed to him?\n\nIt sounds to me like you don't want to vacation with them, and this FB post is a convenient excuse. If you don't want to go - tell her you won't go, and tell her he needs help. Give her some recommendations. Have you ever spoken to her about it and told her you agree with the teacher and that Dylan has issues that need treating?\n\nI have a relative who was in denial about their child's autism. Even when a babysitter who was an RN said the child needed interventions. Total denial. But, eventually nearly a year after that babysitter said something, they went to the doctor. At least the child eventually got help. Dylan needs help.", "Yes, OP, YTA. You\u2019re cutting off your nose to spite the face by withholding your family from their extended family. Your concern has nothing to do with your children\u2019s safety or wellbeing, and everything to do with you disliking your sister\u2019s opinions and attitude, specifically what she has expressed regarding her feelings about your teacher friend. Feel free to do what you think is right, but the fact that you can apparently be bought with the removal of a social media post would indicate that you don\u2019t really take this as seriously as you claim. You can pick your friends, and you can pick your nose, but you can\u2019t pick your friend\u2019s nose.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is delusional.\n\nFor homophobia problem - I think it could be more to it. You said that Dylan is cruel. He likes when other people are hurt or unhappy. It's possible that he weaponizes some prejudices and beliefs to find an excuse to bully others. So he will be homophobic to abuse someone not 100% heterosexual, racist to not white children and sexist for girls. When he's not trying to hurt someone or is afraid to do it (like with your much older your nephew) homophobia disappear...", "NTA, but you shouldn't be wearing your teacher hat to the family table.  \n\nSure, he's *that kid* with *that mom*, but you really need to keep his school stuff at arms length and leave them to be your sister and your nephew.  If it's a egg on your face feeling, remind your coworkers that he's not your kid, and just because you work there doesn't mean they should be associating him with you. In all honesty, since he's not your student, and you're not his guardian it's actually inappropriate for the other teachers to bring these situations to you.\n\nIf you absolutely have to challenge something she says or post, do so with a well organized reason and list of examples - not a demand that goes nowhere near the root of the problem.", "You don\u2019t have to like or agree with what she posts but at the end the day she has the right to put it out there. If you don\u2019t want to go on a family vacation, then just don\u2019t go don\u2019t use her social media post as an excuse to get out of it. If your sister wants to run her mouth on the Internet, let her do it. YTA and hide her posts", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
