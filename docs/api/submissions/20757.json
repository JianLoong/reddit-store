To top this wonderful story, he\u2019s even went to the middle name of your child and decided to name that too. Then, tells his mother that your baby is going to be named after her. Wow, I didn\u2019t see a single thing in this post about anything you wanted, or not wanted. So that tells me that there are some bigger issues at play in your relationship. You are carrying this child, you fill out this baby\u2019s birth certificate, and you have the final say. Normally I would say it\u2019s a split decision and y\u2019all should compromise, but he got the compromising stripped from him after he wanted to act like a petulant child.
