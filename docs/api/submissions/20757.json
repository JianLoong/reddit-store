To top this wonderful story, he\u2019s even went to the middle name of your child and decided to name that too. Then, tells his mother that your baby is going to be named after her. Wow, I didn\u2019t see a single thing in this post about anything you wanted, or not wanted. So that tells me that there are some bigger issues at play in your relationship. You are carrying this child, you fill out this baby\u2019s birth certificate, and you have the final say. Normally I would say it\u2019s a split decision and y\u2019all should compromise, but he got the compromising stripped from him after he wanted to act like a petulant child.

Why does he get to be more excited about naming his first daughter, when it\u2019s her first daughter too?", "She cares about being involved in choosing the name. She doesn\u2019t have to acquiesce to his every preference and her willingness to compromise shouldn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t get a say at all.", "My dad only got my middle name (and my mom still changed the spelling). They weren't married so my mom offered to hyphenate; he said that was stupid and to pick one, so she picked hers \ud83d\ude02\n\nHe was an abusive deadbeat that contributed to my CPTSD that I cut out of my life almost 8yrs ago with no regrets.", "I'm petty and stubborn, therefore this is exactly what I would do. Or I'd write a list of 3-4 first/middle combos I like and tell him it would make ME really happy if he just shut up and picked one from the list.", "I like that one.", "If he ain't in the delivery room he has no say so", "Agree wholeheartedly, when the time came for us to name our LO my partner and I both compiled a list of names for both boy and girl and knocked names off til we had a name for both til we knew. \n\nI had plenty of names I thought would be great. In the end though it was the name she chose that stuck, and multiple factors made me come around to it. \n\nThe fact that he\u2019s this forceful with his opinion and wants no input from OP shows so many red flags \ud83d\udea9 \n\nOP NTA", "Dead friend? What about his *\u2019living\u2019 wife*? \n\ud83e\udd14", "I agree! I named my kids because I did 99% of the work getting them here. He did not get a say except for the last name. I did take his thoughts into consideration but ultimately I chose.", "That\u2019s a wild opinion if you have a partner you will be raising the child together it\u2019s should be a partner decision. Crazy talk", "I\u2019m the opposite, I carried the baby and bonded on more ways then one, he can choose the names as a way for him to feel like he had a role and to help bonding process. Fortunately I liked all three of my children\u2019s names. Not sure what I would do if I didnt.", "That's ridiculous.", "Such a shitty comment.\n\nHe is as much a parent as the mom.", ">The middle name tradition is BS because you know he would have mentioned it earlier.\n\nThat jumped out at me, too. \nThey had lots of discussions about names but he waits till she's 8 months pregnant to mention a tradition? He's lying.", "This is why I can't take men who always follow theur mother's orders. Usually, they end up invalidating the OP's opinions..", "This right here.\n\nMy son was named by my ex and his late sister. His mother and this sister made all kinds of legal decisions for my son (age he was given the HPV vaccine as an example) and routinely left me off of school documents, doctors contacts, etc. They WILL push you out like you're just an incubator. \n\nStand your ground now or start preparing yourself to lose your baby eventually.", "Yeah.", "Id go a couple steps farther and give her whatever first and middle name you want in front of your last name too because once she isn\u2019t the little pawn he expects he probably won\u2019t care about her either.  That you are nearly postpartum around this controlling jerk is frightening.", "It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t see that he\u2019s being selfish\u2014he doesn\u2019t *care* what she wants/needs/thinks. In his eyes, her preferences and opinions are an annoyance, for the most part.\n\nOnce you see these people for who they are, you can never unsee them.\n\nRun, OP, run!", "My statement is a fact. They both created the fetus. Without one or the other, the fetus wouldnt exist.", "I'd insist on a compromise instead of trying to make deals for middle and last names.", "This is very important information. Also, NTA", "This is fascinating. Thank you for sharing this info. Here in the USA the woman can tell everyone, including the father, to get out (except medical staff of course). And she can decide name alone.", "Technically dad only needs to sign a statutory declaration of parentage if they want to be on the birth certificate without dad being there.\n\nBut the same is the other way round so he can't pull a fast one and would need mum's completed and signed statutory declaration if he wanted to go on his own.\n\nEither way, not being married there is little to no chance he'll be able to push through the name he wants. Especially as the registrar will ask questions separately so OP can raise their concerns at the time if going to register the birth with dad.", "Yea sort of", "No. Cry moar", "It doesn\u2019t have to be fair. That\u2019s feminist flexing.\n\nIf this woman doesn\u2019t actually care which name she gets to control, then all she wants is control. If she were even a little interested with naming her child, then she would insist on an actual name, not merely having control.", "He doesn\u2019t want to negotiate because he loves the names he\u2019s chosen while she doesn\u2019t GAF about what her daughter is named. \n\nShe just needs to have a say because she\u2019s disagreeable. Compromise would be \u201cI get the first name and you get the second name,\u201d not \u201cour daughter won\u2019t have a middle name at all if I can\u2019t decide what it is.\u201d", "Thank you for agreeing", "This guy sounds like a piece of work though so he probably won\u2019t react well to that. So many red flags it makes me sad.

(I thought it was a weird system too, I grew up in the US but had my kids in the UK.) \n\nIf you are married either parent can go it doesn\u2019t matter which (or you can still go together). You have to take a marriage certificate etc.", "Yes I did think of that form after I wrote this but yes, either way he hopefully can\u2019t do anything without her permission. \n\n(If they are married she probably should hide the marriage certificate and her passport so he can\u2019t run off and register it without her knowing too. He would need that.)\n\nSo many red flags that this would be an issue in a relationship \ud83d\ude29.", "So you\u2019re faulting her for being willing to compromise? Lol. Sounds reasonable.", "Why exactly doesn't have to be fair? Also, how does her not being concerned which name she gets to pick make her more of a control freak than her husband wanting to pick both?\n\nAlso, either check your misogyny at the door or STFU because \"feminist flexing\" is the biggest BS of your entire comment.", "He doesn\u2019t want to negotiate because he loves the names he\u2019s chosen while she doesn\u2019t GAF about what her daughter is named. \n\nShe just needs to have a say because she\u2019s disagreeable.

She's funny :)", "The future child's dna is 50 percent father. My statements are all facts and not up for debate. Especially when they dont matter *at all* to the post's answer.", "Definitely good shout on hiding marriage certificate and passport if married. Sounds like they are not so hopefully that means she's a little better protected.\n\nBut yeah, if he starts like this now, I do worry about how he'll be once baby comes. Having had my own son 8 months ago, a new first baby puts even the best relationship under a lot of stress and not sure it would end well for OP and their partner.", "She\u2019s compromising on her need to control. Who cares?\n\nAn excited husband loves his daughter and wants to name her, and the wife can\u2019t be bothered what she\u2019s named either way. She just need to have some say because she\u2019s disagreeable.", "Or Winston Churchill\u2026", "Sure they do. Some people go by the \"equal say because equal genetics\" policy you suggest, and others go by the \"father's opinion should be taken into consideration, but it's ultimately the mother's right to name the child she did the work to build\" policy. \n\nSince not everyone does things the way you think they should, it matters to the post's answer that both methods exist, so that the OP can choose for herself which one she prefers to use.", "Or she\u2019s excited about her daughter and wants to name her. \n\nYou\u2019re ascribing negative intentions to OP because you hate women. Stop that.", "Nah.\n\nI\u2019m ascribing negative intention to the OP based on her behaviour.\n\n\u201cI get to give the baby a middle name or she doesn\u2019t have one at all.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a vie for power and control. If naming her daughter was really important, she wouldn\u2019t back down for nothing.

It\u2019s control. Her having a say is more important than her child having a middle name. So she doesn\u2019t actually care whether her daughter has a middle name. But her husband does. So let him have it. \n\nThis reminds me of the story of Solomon and two women fighting over a child. They both insisted the child was theirs, so Solomon\u2019s \u201csolution\u201d was to cut the baby in half. The real mother chose to give up her child to the baby snatcher to save his life, while the snatcher happily complied with Solomon\u2019s ruling proving she was not only a snatcher, but had no love for the child she insisted was hers.  Either she got the child whole or she would let him die.\n\nThe \u201cmy way or nothing\u201d attitude is the attitude of insincere people just trying to preserve their own pride/appearances.", "What do you call him shooting down every name she suggested an insisting on his top pick? Hint: it\u2019s not compromise. \n\nShe wants to help name her own damn kid. How the hell you\u2019ve twisted that to be unreasonable is beyond me."]}
