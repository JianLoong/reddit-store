I wasn\u2019t too sure on the name when I first heard it but it did grow on me after a few weeks and he also turned down every single name i mentioned, when I say close to 20 different names and he didn\u2019t like any of them he was pretty much set on naming her after his late friend. \nThe idea of middle names got brought up and he straight away said that his mum would be happy if we gave her his mothers middle name and I didn\u2019t hate that idea but what I didn\u2019t like is how he said it like he expected me to agree. I\u2019ve never had an issue with his side of the family they are nice and friendly people very easy to get along with never had any issues, I told my partner that either I picked her middle name or she didn\u2019t have one because he choose her first name, and also I\u2019m not a huge fan of the middle name in question but that\u2019s not the point. \n He straight away turned it down and said his mum told him how happy she would be if our daughter got her middle name and I just don\u2019t agree with that I also gave him another opinion our daughter can have his mums middle name but she gets my last name and again he didn\u2019t agree and then again I stated well she just doesn\u2019t get one then if we cannot agree and he said how his whole family has a tradition where everybody must have a middle name. \nAm I being responsible with my arguments or am I not being responsible whatsoever??", "created_utc": 1687897475, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14kof6u/aita_for_not_letting_my_partner_name_our_unborn/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In fact, he expects you to agree with all his opinions and none of yours. You do see that, right?\n\nI'd die on this hill as he clearly has no respect for your opinion on this topic. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou're willing to compromise. Your partner is not.\n\nDon't be a doormat.", "NTA Two yes's 1 no situation. Stand your ground or resent him", "NTA. Why does he get to decide all names? Honestly I wouldn\u2019t want to be with a man that wouldn\u2019t meet me in the middle with something like this. I would stand my ground on her getting my last name.", "NTA, he shouldn't expect you to be happy with everything he wants. It's not just his child, but yours too. You should have a choice!", "He shot down every single name you mentioned to him. Sounds like he\u2019s dead set on naming this child after HIS friend that passed away, okay I get that. They were close. But to be so closed minded to the fact that he\u2019s not budging on anything. To top this wonderful story, he\u2019s even went to the middle name of your child and decided to name that too. Then, tells his mother that your baby is going to be named after her. Wow, I didn\u2019t see a single thing in this post about anything you wanted, or not wanted. So that tells me that there are some bigger issues at play in your relationship. You are carrying this child, you fill out this baby\u2019s birth certificate, and you have the final say. Normally I would say it\u2019s a split decision and y\u2019all should compromise, but he got the compromising stripped from him after he wanted to act like a petulant child. You should really analyze this relationship you are in. Because if you cave on him getting to name your child, then he\u2019s going to pull the wool over your eyes on some serious shit. NTA", "NTA, it sounds like a red flag honestly that he isn\u2019t open to any compromise. As a fellow pregnant woman deciding on a name is incredibly hard but it sounds like he\u2019s making a unilateral decision and does not care about your opinion. Makes me nervous for future disagreements on parenting styles.", "NTA - but your partner is. Sorry but he\u2019s being totally unreasonable. This is your child too, who you are carrying and are going to have to birth. (After my husband witnessed that he said I could have any names I wanted for the kids lol. I wanted him to pick too though so we decided together, but he never argued with me lol.) \n\nThere\u2019s no way he should pick TWO names you don\u2019t want! \n\nThe fact that he\u2019s acting like this at all raises a lot red flags. I don\u2019t think any reasonable person would try to force two names (well three including surname) on the other parent against their will!\n\nAgain, NTA but your partner is acting like one!", "NTA\n\nYou've already let him decide on her first name with no input from you. Now he wants to give her a middle name that he's chosen with once again no input from you. He essentially just wants you to nod your head and agree with everything he wants, and expects you to keep his mouth shut. Stand your ground, if you have to go to his family and explain \"Hey, I also want to be involved in naming my kid, and not just having hubby dictate to me what the child in my womb's name will be!\"\n\nYour a married couple. You need to remind him that marriage is a partnership based on compromising with one another. You've already compromised with him, either he gives you some slack and compromises, or you put your foot down.", "NTA. Child names have to be agreed upon by both parties. One person cannot unilaterally decide your child\u2019s name if you are not also happy with that name", "NTA - TBH, this sounds like the problems in your relationship go much deeper than just naming your child (though that is obviously still important). I think you two need to have a serious discussion about decision making related to your daughter going forward.", "Who is this guy? Is he always this self absorbed and self important? Is he a bully in other areas? Has he shown that he can collaborate, share and compromise in other ways? If not you've got WAY bigger problems than a name. Let this thread ripen up and send it to him. We'll tell him he's being an ass even if he won't listen to you. \n\nNTA", "You're NTA. When they cut the cord for your baby, tell them that while they're at it...", "NTA\n\nI can't see how you'd be irresponsible. But he's being overbearing.\n\nYou accepted his choice of first name. Now it's your turn to pick the middle name.. He doesn't get to choose both names.", "NTA\n\nNames are a two yes, one no sort of situation, and your partner is not willing to compromise at all.", "NTA. This is something that you need to decide together.\n\n>said his mum told him how happy she would be if our daughter got her middle name\n\nHe's way out of line getting her involved. You're the one he needs to keep happy. His friend, his mother and his family traditions? No.", "NTA - I hope he isn't always this controlling", "NTA. He wants to get to pick every part of your kids name. Thats not cool. You both will raise her, you both helped create her, so you both get a say in the name. If he wants to pick the first name, you get the middle. Fair is fair.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve offered compromises and he\u2019s refused all of them and rejects all your suggestions. From your use of the word partner instead of husband remember that in the U.K. he is not allowed to legally register the baby, only you can do that. In the time you have before baby is born consider your relationship, I don\u2019t know if I could be with someone so uninterested in compromise, especially over something so important. This is definitely a hill to die on because it will be with you forever", "You both are parents and should equally deside on your childs name. You are being reasonable with splitting first, middle and last name. Him getting upset is not fair to you and making his mother happy is not the point of raising a child. You have a right to name your child whatever you want as long as you and your husband both agree.", "NTA but baby names shouldn't be tit for tat compromises. You all need to find a name you both like.", "NTA if that\u2019s how he sees the situation tell him he can pick the first or middle, not both, no wiggle room.", "NTA. The baby should also have your last name or at least double-barrell.", "NTA.\n. . I am pretty sure in most developed countries the mother can dictate who comes in and out of a delivery room (im assuming not married). And you get to decide the kid's name inthe end, so they can ASK, but YOU get to ultimately decide. Its your kid too and you get ultimate voice.", "INFO\n\nDid the deceased soldier, aside from their friendship, have an impactful relationship with your partner, i.e. did he save his life in combat or something along those lines?", "NTA. You are pushing the human out, you get final say on the name.", "Ummm\n\nIt's 2 yeses, 1 no.  \n\nSo if he \"no'ed\" all your name suggestions, there's the 1 no.\n\nAll this other stuff is besides the point.  So, the fact that you \"have\" to be the one to suggest either the first or middle name is a bit into YTA camp.  \n\nIf you \"yes'ed\" his deceased friend's name, then that's 2 yes.\n\nSure, the middle name could be \"1 no\" but the no should be because you don't like it and not because he suggested it. (Also, an aside, both of his suggestions have sentimental value... which does give them some weight... you aren't debating his mother vs your mother. You're debating his mother vs wanting to be the one who picked it).", "NTA - Your body, your name choice.", "NTA for wanting a say in your daughter\u2019s name.  \n\nYTA for declaring that your daughter will have no middle name before she will have his mother\u2019s.
