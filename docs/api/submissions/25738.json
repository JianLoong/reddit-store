I think your daughter probably would have been just as happy with a nice used car. And as others have said, insurance for a new car is much higher than insurance for a used car, so it depends on if you're going to be paying for that as well.

Bogus.", "NAH\n\nI mean, she is your daughter and your ex can't insist you don't buy her anything that the ex doesn't want / can't give her own children.

He got you the car\". . . .", "NTA - it\u2019s a dumb financial decision to buy a brand new car for a kid who\u2019s just passed their test.

And it\u2019s not yours or your daughter\u2019s problem if her mother and stepdad don\u2019t have the same money to buy cars for their other kids. \n\nI can see why it puts them in a very difficult position as there\u2019s a visible disparity among the kids living in their household. However accusing you of deliberately trying to show her up is a cheap shot. Don\u2019t be surprised if your ex tries to spin it with your daughter along the lines of \u201cwell of course he\u2019s going to try to buy your love now, he\u2019s not been in your life enough, not like I have.

She is bitter because the other kids won\u2019t get one and made her look like a bad parent? Her jealousy is showing. Blended families are always difficult but the kids need to realize her dad is HERs and she will get things they won\u2019t and they will get things she won\u2019t from their side. \n\nYou are not around your daughter daily and wanted to get her a big gift for her birthday. Yes, you probably should have communicated this to your ex that you were getting her one but I am guessing it\u2019s not a healthy co-parenting relationship.", "YTA This is definitely something you discuss with a co-parent before doing. Who is paying for gas, maintenance, insurance, etc.?", "ESH\n\nThis is not a small gift, it's a big one that come with a lot of impact in the life of everybody involve. There is gas, insurance, maintenance, registration, but also just the teaching opportunity about value and responsibility. This is not a decision that should be made by only one parent. It should have been a discussion with her mother. \n\n>I think since she\u2019s my daughter too I should be able to buy her whatever I want.\n\nOk, but this is going both way and the mother can give her whatever she want too. For example paying a road trip for your daughters and 3 guys you don't know? Or maybe if she buy your daughter a super sexy dress that you might not be comfortable with? What if she bought your daughter an apartment at the other side of the country?\n\nYou would have no issues with anything her mother buy her right? Because it's her daughter too and the mother should be able to buy her whatever she want. It suppose to be co-parenting, meaning that both parent should have a say in the big decision in the life of the child.\n\nBut at the same time, some of the reasons your ex gave are pretty sus. I can understand all of them, but you are not responsible for their own insecurity or how their children feel about your treatment of your own daughter.\n\nBut the argument about learning to work, save and buy her own stuff is an extremely important one. This is a lesson you should want your daughter to have for her own sake in life. Plenty of compromise were available here so that you can help your daughter get the car, but still let her learn to work, safe and buy it herself. For example, maybe if she save a certain amount of money you gave her the difference so she can buy the car.", "ESH. You should have communicated better with your ex about it. It's a huge purchase; just because you wanted to surprise your daughter doesn't mean you had to surprise your ex as well.", "YTA. I think I'm more peeved by the phrasing of all this more than anything. If there's a loan on the car, that title isn't in your daughter's name. Whoever holds the loan on the car owns that car, followed by the person the pink slip will go to when/if that gets paid. Call it a technicality, but there's two sets of people that can have this car towed at their whim.", "NTA - when you asked if she was going to get her a car, that was her moment to explain why she wasn\u2019t and didn\u2019t want you to.

That is just too big of a decision to make without looping in the other parental units.", "YTA I think you knew what you were doing because you didn't ask any follow up questions when your ex said she wasn't getting her a car. You can buy your daughter things but you have to also consider what her mother wants and how it effects their life. Who's going to pay for gas, insurance, upkeep etc. Do you know if your daughter is responsible enough for a car? These are all things you should have discussed with your ex before you purchased that responsibility for your daughter", "I get where you Ex is coming from.

Do you want to get along?\n\nMissed the part where you took out a loan for the car.  Financially, I think that was a and move.  Now your daughter may think you should take out loans whenever she needs things.  You could have her make the payments, or 50% of the payments.  Then she will have  stake in the car and maintaining it.", "NTA I really hate people who want their kids to work to buy a shitty car because that is what those sub 10k cars usually are especially now.

Your wife should be happy that her eldest is in a (presumably) safe and reliable new car.", "NAH - You should have told the mother that you're buying the car, and worked with her on guidelines. Buying a new car for a beginner is irresponsible, and seeing as how you didnt pay cash, especially more so.", "YTA, a gift this large needs to be discussed between both parents. Your wife has some good points. Also, a 16 year old doesn\u2019t need a brand new car. They will ding and dent it, people will have meltdowns about it and you\u2019ll be stuck paying for it for decades.

And yes it does upset their balance with her and her new husbands kids.  Which sure life isn\u2019t fair but that doesn\u2019t make what you did a dick move. What happens if daughters grades slip or something else? Mom can\u2019t take away the car because guess what? Not hers to take away. You have majorly shifted the power dynamics when you\u2019re not the custodial parent. Which\u2026 does make it seem like you might have done it on purpose. Maybe not, but that\u2019s what it looks like. \n\nWhat you should do now that you\u2019ve already bought it is guarantee that car is paid for you by you (everything inc insurance gas registration taxes\u2026) and feel free to work an arrangement out with your daughter about that on your own terms. But that has to be your responsibility as you didn\u2019t make that clear in the post.  Some states have laws that the primary household where the teen lives has to maintain the insurance. Are you willing to make sure you cover that because now they may not have a choice but to a new car on their insurance plan and that is incredibly expensive with a teen driver. I literally just went through this with my teen whose grandparents bought him a car (after we discussed!!) and we had to put that car on our insurance because every driver in the household has to be covered. Our rates went up so much \ud83d\ude44 \n\n\nBeautiful gesture. Not thought through at all.", ">***NTA.  When she told you that they weren't getting her a car.    I thought they would be happy she got a brand new car.   I don't think anyone is going to agree with methat's. okay.  I think it's great that you bought her a car.  NTA***\n\n***The divorce rate is 60 percent.   Children of divorce have it tough..   The step children in this family will get upset because your  daughter drives a new car and then the step kids might not get a car at all.    There is conflict in families that have step children can be difficult.***", "I would actually prefer older cars, if the used car market hadn't gone to sh#t. Regardless of safety standards, finding decent used cars at a reasonable price has become difficult.", "Out of all things you could\u2019ve compared it to you chose suggestive things involving a minor\u2026 fucking weirdo lmao", "European car market as well. There people who manage to resell well maintained cars for the same amount that they bought it. Due to covid shortages and bad green policies that heavily subsidize ev's for companies, leading to less former company cars on the used car market.\n\nI actually got called by the dealer where i bought my car (new) if i wanted to sell it back to them for almost the same amount that i bought it.\n\nThe only reason i didn't was that i wouldn't be able to find a good replacement vehicle.", "i had to take out a loan a couple years back for a used 2008 hyundai elantra \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "no one said it was brand new, just that he had to take out a loan. in my area even cars older than 5 years can be up to 10k, and maybe he doesn't have that laying around?", "Yta you don't discuss with your daughter what car she needs for her lifestyle. You make a blind choice without ask.", "$7k-15k will still get you a pretty good, if not great, used car. Maybe not at a dealership, but private sale. Have that car baby inspected, and good to go if it all checks out. \n\nI have a 2012 hatch that had 180k when I got it. I'm the second owner and it was well maintained. It just depends on how much cost via time and effort vs straight cash.", "NTA necessarily the thought of the gift is what counts however you shouldve played it smarter because the way you went about buying her car was kind of dumb", "YTA, and this is probably a made up story.\n\nWhat sort of person takes out a loan to buy a car for a kid. Who doesn't even live with them.", "That was super sweet of you and I\u2019m sure your daughter is thrilled. I really think where you went wrong here was the brand new car without even giving your ex a heads up. I wouldn\u2019t want someone giving my kid a brand new car for their 16th birthday without a heads up. I honestly wouldn\u2019t want my kid to have a brand new car at 16 period so i would also be pretty pissed. I think most of your ex should have calmed down before calling you because but it was also a HUGE surprise and it would have been nice to at least let her know because it is absolutely could cause issues and resentment with your daughters  step siblings who she has to live with for two more years. Since you didn\u2019t give her a heads up it would be kind of you to just be the bigger person here and tell her that you are sorry if it\u2019s causing any issues in her home and that you were just genuinely excited to be able to do it for her and hadn\u2019t even considered that angle. Should you have to? Probably not, but I think generally keeping the peace in coparenting situations just works the best. Your daughter is going to be 18 and going to college soon and I doubt anything like this will ever come up again."]}
