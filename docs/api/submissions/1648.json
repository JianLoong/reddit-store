But I've got to say, high school was a long time ago, and what you've written suggests that the imploding was something that happened because of differences, not a particular action on her part. \n\nShe hasn't called, but neither have you. The phone works both ways, so unless there's something you're not telling us, it seems you're equally responsible for the (lack of) relationship.\n\nWhen people are in crisis, we often reach out to the only other people we think might be able to handle a big ask: family.
