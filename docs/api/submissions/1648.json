It was mutual (what I can speculate based on the post). \n\n  \nThe part I really had a problem with was this quote \"Emily hadn't spoken to me in years and now all of a sudden she thinks she and her family can invade my home?\". For goodness sake, her home was destroyed by a tornado and she's asking for a place to stay (and even gave you a timeline of 4 months). \n\n  \nBy no means am I saying you're obligated to offer your house for your sister to use, especially if you guys aren't getting along. But the way this post is worded makes OP sound heartless in my opinion. Even this quote doesn't settle well with me \"No. I wasn't having her using me like that\". She's not using you, she's asking for help because she needs it.  And what puts the nail in the coffin is this \" I told her no and then ended the conversation by telling her not to feel bad, as her \"God\" certainly had a plan for her\". \n\n  \nDid you really feel the need to throw her religion and beliefs in her face WHEN HER HOME IS LITERALLY DESTRYOYED. Shit, at this point you're not beating a dead horse, you're killing it all over again. \n\n  \nI get that you don't get along with your sister OP, and I'm not calling you TA for not letting your sister stay with you. But the way you talked to her makes you TA. Maybe this is just my optimistic view of the world, but this could have been an opportunity to reconcile with each other.", "NTA for not letting them stay. It\u2019s your place so that\u2019s that. \n\nI see people applauding your jabs at the end and I don\u2019t get it. So its suddenly ok to take jabs at personal beliefs because you don\u2019t agree? Also, I\u2019m sure your relationship imploding isn\u2019t just one sided and I\u2019d be will you bet money you\u2019ve been just as mean to her and you\u2019ve made her out too be.", "NTA", "NTA Love it. Love everything about it.", "NTA. You could have been more graceful in your denial but you have no obligation to take her and her family in.", "Honestly, I think the content about her religion at the end was uncalled for. You have the right to refuse her moving in. But they comment stuck out to me.", "yeah i agree,,, i wouldnt want a family member  all the sudden  moving into my home when i dont know them", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2FrFBceLuY", "She told me something about \"wanting to be with family during her trying times.\"", "Our parents live in Florida. I live in New Mexico. She lives in Texas. It was solely an issue of geography.", "Nah, she's right on the money. If her sister values the relationship to God over the relationship to OP, it's clear whom she should be asking for help.", "OP has more info in the comments. Relationship seems to have deteriorated over sister trying to convert her.\n\nI'm going NTA because it appears sister has a problem with OP being atheist, leading to the loss in contact", "ESH.\n\nUnless the sister brought religion into this specific conversation (the first one they\u2019d had in years) it was a poor move.\n\nEven a passive aggressive \u201cWell, why haven\u2019t you reached out to your church. Don\u2019t they have charitable programs for situations like this?\u201d would have been a more appropriate level of petty. Going right to mocking and gloating was crossing a line and put OP in the asshole category as well.\n\nAlso, did they not have homeowner\u2019s insurance? Is she getting a check for temporary housing she wants to keep?", "Not really if you read OP\u2019s comments the sister has been shitting on her atheism for years trying to convert her.", "Notice how very quickly everyone here downvoted opposite viewpoints and accused them of bias. A blatant act of hostile cruelty towards a homeless family with small kids is vindicated because years ago the mother converted to Christianity and attempted to persuade OP to as well. Reddit is full of hypocrites as always.", "Where? I'm in Alburquerque.", "Found the sister ^", "Sister alert", "From my experience while this is true, it doesn't happen instantly. When my house burned down in 2019 I was technically homeless for a couple weeks living off my friends couch until the insurance company put me somewhere.", "Wrong post?", "Of the two of them, only one got her house demolished by an 'act of God'. Sounds like OP should be doing the converting by that standard.", "we've been sent good weather.", "Yeah I imagine her sister would try to impose some 'ground rules', no sharing a bed, modest clothing, language etc...", "Especially if they are uber religious.", "Hmm just because they dated for a year doesn\u2019t mean they had sex in that time!", "Ignoring your sister is an action.  Calling after years only when you need something.  This is an action.  Never communicating with your sister is an action.  This isn\u2019t super confusing.", "She got married and had two kids and didn\u2019t just not include her sister (invite her to her wedding) but didn\u2019t even reach out to let her know. I think it\u2019s a pretty safe assumption to say her sister has behaved hatefully.", "> we never really spent any time together or had any common interests. This only got worse when Emily found Christ during her senior year of high school; after I realized I was an atheist, our relationship basically imploded\n\nFrom the OP. A relationship doesn't \"implode\" if there's no bad blood.", "Reddit is so odd. Another commenter said they same thing as you and was significantly downvoted.", "Yeah she didn't seem to do anything wrong. OP seems to have held a grudge and was needlessly petty", "Depends on whether it's El Paso or Houston...\n\nIn fact, Houston is almost twice as far from El Paso as from Pensacola.", "More likely they are pocketing money they're getting for temporary housing while they mooch off family.  Or maybe they actually got evicted.", "Maybe part of it is that she wants to have a relationship with you and she felt like this was her opening?  Her homeowners insurance would pay for a place for them to live.  She doesn\u2019t need to stay with you.", "Yes understandable, but when it comes to principals she should have skipped you. Many years has passed and she had some nerve coming to you know.", "Ok? My judgment remains the same.", "My sister has abused me for decades. Even my parents can't stand to be around her anymore. But I refuse to stoop to her level and become cruel and malicious. You might want to think about doing the same...", "Probably because of the context in the comments. Sister spent years trying to convert OP before contact was cut", "People on this sub don't like religious people and love it when anyone gets told off--necessary or not.", "Im a little south im in los lunas like 45 min away from abq", "That act of God was meant to bring Gods light into OP\u2019s life, dontch\u2019a know!", "After all, he is an all-loving, merciful God right? The one who lets millions suffer and die horribly from starvation and disease? The one who created that disease? The one who will punish ~~the bad people~~ everybody for all eternity simply for existing? The one that demands your eternal love and devotion on pain of infinite suffering? The one who created himself, raped himself in order to birth himself so he can later kill himself, then resurrect himself for the good of his future himselfs?\n\nThat God? I thought you were talking about about the hateful, narcissistic, selfish, psychopathic, megalomaniacal monster! Well thank God for that!", "It's an action OP also did. By all their accounts, their disagreements were mutual.", "It's in the comments.", "But the OP was asking for judgment based on this encounter, not their entire relationship. Even so, it was still a shitty thing to say, regardless.", "That's so hypocritical. Everyone should respect the beliefs, or lack thereof, of others.", "Nope, this is what Christian folk do. Go be pre judged somewhere else.", "We can disregard the age difference.  Yes.  It is a two way street but to ignore someone for years\u2014and the. Call and ask if your entire family can move it?   No relationship means no favors.  No relationship is a decision which causes consequences.", "Good to know but stuff like that should be in the original post. Not everyone has time to read comments and replies.", "Yeah especially since they literally lost their home to a freaking tornado. To be needlessly spiteful for stuff done as a teenager is petty and ridiculous", "Hell, my sister is outright emotionally abusive(even decades later, I had to cut her off). And as hateful as she is(which my parents admit to), I would still never say anything like that because it's just cruel. And even then ugh my sister would totally say something that malicious, I would never stoop to her level. I have been in a killer tornado(11/5/05 SW Indiana tornado that killed two dozen), and even though I didn't lose my home, just the experience in and of itself was so traumatic.", "Exactly I lost my house to a housefire. The idea of coming back home then realising home is gone and will never be back is scary. OP belittling her is beyond cruel. I can say I would put her up for probably like a month (more if they are willing to help with expenses). She is completely cruel even in her comments towards her sister.", "Which honestly makes me wonder if her portrayal of her sister is completely honest."]}
