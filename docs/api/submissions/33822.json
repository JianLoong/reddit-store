This suggests she's made poor choices.  \n\nYou have met her twice.  Do you know if she's mature and responsible? You have no idea what type of person she is. She's a total stranger to you.

The phrasing comes across as almost entitled, although it is probably largely driven by fear and desperation.  \n\nThing is, she's not homeless at the moment... it's just not a great long term solution.  Problem with that is, it implies that she sees your home as a long term solution... and that there's some kind of entitlement because it was passed down to you.  \n\nWhat's her plan for her future?  How does she plan to look after herself and her baby?  I would most definitely not even consider it unless she has this figured out and is on the way to accomplishing it.

For you, it was a substitute for the child support your father would otherwise have had to pay for YOU. Not for your half sister, who lived with him. That was his bargain. You have essentially bought the house by forgoing those payments. Your half sister has no more claim on this property than a child of someone who owned the house before your grandparents did. Or any of your cousins on your father\u2019s side.\n\nOn the practical side, ask yourself, how are you going to get her out of your house if you let her in? You are living at a distance, so you won\u2019t know whether she is damaging your house or not until it\u2019s too late. It\u2019s much easier to let her go find her own housing than to put yourself in the position of evicting a woman and a baby. Especially one who basically told you that she deserves your house. She doesn\u2019t. Your father supported her while he abandoned you and failed to support you. If you want to help an unwed mother, she\u2019s no more deserving of your help than any random stranger.", "NTA. That stay will extend and extend. Any and all set boundaries will be broken out of necessity or emergency. _Yes, you may inhabit my house temporarily under a fixed set of conditions_ will automatically be received as _yes, stay however long you like and do whatever the fuck you want._ Also, she keeps pushing despite being firmly told no. A precursor to what'll be in store for you if you cave in. Please don't.", "If there is currently no one living in the house, I would probably let her stay there for a time. Here in the US its tricky, you can let someone live in your place for a while and suddenly they are tenants with a broad range of rights making it near impossible and very costly to get them out of your place. Also, since she wants to live there \"until she figured out what to do\" that leaves it very open ended. She can simply say that she hasnt figured out what to do yet for years. Also her basic argument is that she is somehow entitled to live there due to her genetic connection to your grandparents. So there are many reasons not to let her live there. \n\nBut there is one reason, and its a biggie. There is an innocent child that never harmed anyone in need of a place to live. However tenuous, you have a connection to this child. If it is possible to help such a child without causing harm to oneself or another, doing so is the right thing to do. \n\nSo if it was me, I would allow Halfsis to stay for a specific period of time. Due to my local laws, I would have her stay as a guest so that if she brought 15 friends to live with her or held wild parties on the weekends or just didnt keep the lawn mowed I could kick her out on the spot. Tell her what she must do to keep staying there, such as getting a job, any job, or going to school, and what she must not do, and put it all in writing. Include a clause that says that you or your cousin can kick her out just because its Tuesday if you feel like it to cover all the bases. \n\nBut that is my system of morality. if you just dont want the hassle, YWNBTA to simply stick by your initial answer and look for some other way to help her not fraught with land mines. \n\nGood luck to you, her and the child.", "NTA.

I think it's always the right thing to do if you have an empty property and you know someone who needs it, to make sure it gets used. It also sounds like your grandparents would've liked the place being used by their granddaughter and great-granddaughter. It's not theirs anymore, though. You get to make the decision. I can also understand not wanting the stress and hassle of having someone you've only met twice living on your property.

It\u2019s yours, really it\u2019s your moms but it\u2019s yours. It was part of the agreement made as part of the divorce. The grandparent comment was manipulation through and through, and even if she was owed something for being their grandchild it\u2019s definitely not the house your kept as part of dealing with divorce/infidelity. The whole other half of this is that she won\u2019t be leaving anytime soon, and by soon I mean anytime in the next few years.

There is no scenario, especially after the child\u2019s here where she\u2019ll be in a position to get on her feet for years. It\u2019s going to take more than housing for that to happen, the kind of support she needs to be able to keep that child is support only her parents can give. \n\nYou letting her stay would only do 2 things. 1) it would give her false hope, the reality is she\u2019s in no stable position to raise a kid. Even if she lived rent free she can\u2019t take care of her kid and pay to further her education enough to become stable enough to move out. Which brings me to 2) this will become a permanent move. She\u2019ll continue to manipulate and gaslight you until she\u2019s blue in the face; and when if you grow a spine she\u2019s going to make your life hell. She already seems to feel entitled to your home, imagine after she\u2019s lived there rent free or discounted. If you try to push her out after any period she will either destroy the home or make the process so difficult you have to go through the courts to remove her. That costs money, it costs time, an issue you don\u2019t need particularly for someone you don\u2019t owe this to. You also don\u2019t know her dynamic with her mom and dad. You don\u2019t know what kind of issues they may have had with her. \n\nNot all parents kick out their pregnant kid for funsies, particularly parents with skewed moral compasses like them. They\u2019ve likely had problems with her and either this was the last straw, or whatever she was demanding they do for her to keep it was. Either way, not your problem. Send her a message and tell her you\u2019re sorry she\u2019s in a tough spot but she can\u2019t stay in your home. That your grandparents have nothing to do with this. That this wasn\u2019t a house inherited by death, it was a house inherited by divorce and infidelity. That while that may not have been her fault, it doesn\u2019t entitle her to your home. Tell her you refuse to discuss the issue further, and if she attempts to trespass she will be arrested. That you wish her the best but you\u2019d prefer to not have any further contact. Then block her, she either going to go psycho or she\u2019s going to try to play at your heart to get her way. \n\nI also have to point out that if the house indeed is in your fathers name still or any name other than yours/your moms, you not only may not be able to get her out/evict her; that\u2019s a major problem. Also if the person whom owns it (If it\u2019s not your mom) has no will or the deed is in a deceased persons made and never went through probate it\u2019ll give her a case for partial ownership. If your mom and dad never did this the right way letting her stay could cost you big (outside of the emotional toll and likely entitlement you\u2019d have to deal with from her. The law won\u2019t recognize an oral agreement between your mom and dad without paperwork, they might but it could be a court battle. This is a can of worms you cannot afford to open. She\u2019s not a child, she decided to have sex, she\u2019s decided to keep the kid, and it\u2019s on her to figure out how. Is it a hard situation? Yes, but it\u2019s wrong of her to attempt to make it your responsibility. She\u2019s grasping at straws here to get her way. I\u2019d also recommend getting cameras if you don\u2019t already, have your friend install some cheap amazon cameras or see if they\u2019re fine with staying at the house for a few weeks. There\u2019s a chance she may try to show up anyway, you need to plan for that.\n\nEdit: I\u2019d also call the non emergency line for the city your homes in. Tell them there\u2019s a domestic issue with your half sister. That you\u2019re worried about her criminally trespassing, or attempting to break in in an attempt to claim squatters rights. That you want it reported that you contacted them about this so if she does indeed try they can escort her off and ruin her chances of claiming squatters rights.
