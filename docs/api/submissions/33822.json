You don\u2019t HAVE to \u201ckeep it in the family\u201d. You could sell it and invest the money into property that you can actually use. \nThat house represented money due to YOU from your father, it\u2019s not family property it\u2019s what he owed you in lieu of being your father.  \nSell it. Buy something that benefits you and get rid of family thinking they deserve shares of your child support.", "Nta, your father thought it better to give you the house breaking the chain. I\u2019m sure your grandparents wouldn\u2019t have wanted the house to be used in an attempt to skip out on child support and raising his child. \n\nYou owe her nothing and she needs to deal with the consequences of keeping her child\u2019s she sounds unprepared for life. If you coddle her, she won\u2019t ever leave. This is your fathers problem not yours", "NTA.  Your half sister is 18, pregnant and there appears to be no father in the picture.  This suggests she's made poor choices.  \n\nYou have met her twice.  Do you know if she's mature and responsible? You have no idea what type of person she is. She's a total stranger to you.  Would you let a random person unrelated to you move into your house that you'd only met twice?", "NTA.   She's a stranger to you.", "NTA this child has come against the wall of reality that no, she isn't in a position to be a responsible mother. Don't enable her, if you do she will become your responsibility for the rest of her life. This isn't Gilmore Girls.", "NTA. You have had no relationship with this girl or know her at all. She is the product of your dad's affair. There is family & than there are outliers. She is definitely in the outlier category. She doesn't have any rights to a house that your dad gave to *you* as part of the divorce. She needs to figure out her own life. It isn't your responsibility. \n\nI might suggest getting some security on the house. In case she decides to break in & claim squatters rights. Perhaps contact the local police & tell them what is going on. You might even rent the house out to family that you trust so that the house isn't sitting vacant.", "NTA. That\u2019s a blatant manipulation. Yes she is their grandchild too but the house isn\u2019t theirs anymore it\u2019s yours. She isn\u2019t your responsibility. Once you open the door to her you run the risk of her using this to try to take what\u2019s yours. Never do that. She\u2019s made her choice to be a grown up and have a kid now it\u2019s on her to provide for the kid. If she can\u2019t then she shouldn\u2019t be having it.", "NTA.\nBe prepared to loose the house if she gets a foot in it.\nShe is pregnant and will stay in the house for the next 20 years..\nI would contact a lawyer to see what are your options and if she can claim the house back", "She will never leave if you let her stay. You will be stuck with a young girl and a baby.", "NTA. The house is yours, and she will definitely find a way to make it her home leading to a lot of trouble for you down the line.", "NTA. Make sure your cousin knows about her and to not let her into the house.", "NTA. If she doesn't have housing, how is she going to be able to financially raise a child? You don't know her and once she gets into your house, it may be hard to get her to leave. If she knows where this house is, you should make sure that you increase the security around it so she doesn't attempt to break in.", "NTA\n\nThere\u2019s no way she will be ready to move out soon. Her \u201cfigures out what to do\u201d could take years, seeing how she has no support from her dad or her baby\u2019s father (I assumed this since there was no mention of him at all). Desperate people can do a lot of things and I don\u2019t think you want to jeopardize your house and your properties. \n\nProtect your house and offer her assistance in other way like pointing her towards women shelter or supporting programs for teen moms.", "The guilt thing doesn't sit easy with me.  The phrasing comes across as almost entitled, although it is probably largely driven by fear and desperation.  \n\nThing is, she's not homeless at the moment... it's just not a great long term solution.  Problem with that is, it implies that she sees your home as a long term solution... and that there's some kind of entitlement because it was passed down to you.  \n\nWhat's her plan for her future?  How does she plan to look after herself and her baby?  I would most definitely not even consider it unless she has this figured out and is on the way to accomplishing it.  Even then I'd hesitate.  \n\nIF for some reason you let her in there, you don't do so rent free.  You have a rental amount that she must pay and you evict if it's not paid.  You need to protect your assets.", "NTA\n\n  \n\"until she figured out what to do\" .. so until the kid is 20 and moved out, and then it will be to late to find something else.\n\n  \nThis would have been PERMANENT.", "NTA \nBut I would let her stay. \n\nI would do paper work to have her legally as a tenant. Even if it\u2019s a 50 dollars rent to keep it legal. I Would learn about the legislation where the house is located. The house is there and you have no use for it. Always bother me to see houses not in use with so many ppl on the street. \n\nI am not from North America but I grew up in a country where family helps family whenever is possible. Government help is much more rare to have. \n\nIn my opinion your dad was really bad to both of you but she also didn\u2019t have a mom present. In another type of legislation she would have the right to the house too. \n\nYour friend can still keep her eyes on the house. You can store your possessions in one of the rooms if it\u2019s possible. \n\nYou can start to have a relationship with her too, if you wish. Even help her to have a plan to be able to be independent by herself and to give this baby a better chance in life. \n\nAlso wanted to add that if you decide to not help, to not feel guilty. At the end, she is responsible for herself. Best of luck at dealing with this situation.", "NTA - she will never move out.  Keep your distance!", "NTA - Tell her that this house has nothing to do with her. They left it to your dad to stay in the family and he gave it to you when he left off to be her daddy. You have the house and she your dad, that was the deal. You won\u2019t give her the house now too. And your grandparents wouldn\u2019t want that for you too. You may share some DNA, but she\u2019s not your sister, she\u2019s not family, she\u2019s a stranger.", "Don\u2019t even think about letting her step foot in that home lmao", "NTA. Rent out the house or consider putting the house up for sale if there is no chance that you will move back into it. Give your father 1st offer to buy it at fair market price. Then any other relative. If no one in the family buys it, then it goes on the open market. Don't let your half sister move in. If you try to get her to leave in the future, then you will have flying monkeys coming after you. You don't need the headache.", "NTA", "NTA", "Would you let a stranger stay unsupervised in your house? Your half sister is essentially a stranger.

Your stuff; your rules.\n\nHaving said that...dude.  You're in a position to help someone. The house is sitting empty.  You're already paying a cousin to look after the house.  \n\nOn the basis of simple compassion, letting this person stay wouldn't be a hardship for you.  \n\nBut other people have noted, correctly I think, that this person might never 'figure things out'.  So consult the tenancy laws in your country and draw up an agreement with terms you're comfortable with.\n\nHonestly...I was asking myself if your reluctance is based on lingering resentment of your father, and whether you'd react the same way if this person were an acquaintance rather than your father's affair child.", "NTA.

She's not responsible if your father being an horrible character, and she's definitely suffering from him still being that too", "Her father ( yours too) kicked her out, in essence disowned her. Pretty sure even if he still had title to the house that was his grandparents, he would not be willing to let her use it. So why should the current owner give in on the emotional manipulation?

Is Half-Sister the only person badgering you about the house? Do *you* have any plans for it? Does it hold any emotional value to you? If it's becoming a bone of contention that's resulting in your father's side of the family to badger you about letting Half-Sister use the house, what's stopping you from either offering to let Half-Sister (and her side of the family) to purchase it from you, for Fair Market Value, if you don't plan on eventually moving in there, yourself...?

No way would i take on a wildcard", "Awful advice. It\u2019s even harder to get a relative evicted from a so called \u201cfamily house\u201d. And half-sister has no claim to the house - she got a father and OP got the house instead of child support and her father in her life. I think she\u2019s given up quite enough.", "No no no. Bad advise. This is like allowing her the chance to be a squatter. And the longer she stays, the harder it is to evict. She can go to a homeless shelter or something first", "This is terrible advice. Do not let her in your home, you owe her nothing and she will cause nothing but trouble for you. Tell your cousin that under no circumstances is she allowed in and if she does break in to contact authorities immediately to have her removed.
