You\u2019re the one spending time to cook, you get to decide what you make. There are other solutions if he doesn\u2019t want to eat what you make. Calling you inconsiderate is pretty BS, in my opinion.", "NTA. He\u2019s grown and can make his own food. Goes back to when I was a kid, you ate what was put in front of you and if you didn\u2019t like it you could either starve or make yourself something different and clean up after yourself.", "Are you the one that cooks for you both, or is there an understanding that he needs to cook for himself? If it is something you do for both of you, then you need to talk about what's being made. I meal prep most of the time. But I take into consideration what everyone likes. We do have things I will use to make a couple of dinners off 1 protein. But I would never use that for the whole week, even I'd get bored. Since I do most of the cooking, I do encourage suggestions.  If you are the primary cook for both of you, I don't think it's fair to only cook what you want. If you don't and he's expected to cook for himself, then remind him of that. But it seems you need to be on the same page.", "NTA. But dump this nightmare of an entitled Bf ASAP", "Did you ask him prior to cooking it?  Personally I wouldn't want to eat chicken for 4 days, so i agree with him in that sense", "He doesn\u2019t have to eat what you make, he needs a forehead kiss and a binky if he going to act like a picky 4 year old on a hot summer day", "NTA.\n\nIf he wants to eat the food you prepare, he eats the food you choose to prepare.\n\nOtherwise, he\u2019s a big boy and I\u2019m sure he can put something together for himself.", "NTA\n\nHe can make his own food if he doesn't like what you made. That's how it works.", "Ive been meal prepping the same weekly meal.  Chicken. For the past decade\n\nYou two have incompatibility problem\n\nThis is a relationship issue", "Info: What kind of things does he do for you, or do around the house?  Does he take your wants and needs into consideration in daily life?", "ESH  \nOverall, the person making the meal makes the meal and - within reason- chooses what to make. If you know that the other party HATES what you're planning then you should try to plan something else, or at least most of the times you're cooking. Making the same meal every day of the week when that bothers him is not considerate. It also makes you somewhat of an outlier. You suck because you're doing a shared chore in a way that you know bothers him.  \n\n\nHe sucks because he isn't the one meal-prepping and cooking; you're doing one of the household chores so he doesn't have to. If he dislikes your style of meal prep and cooking then he should be able to figure out a way to cook a different meal once or twice a week to break what he sees as monotony. So your meals could look like this:  \n\n\nMonday - Chicken\n\nTuesday - the same chicken\n\nWednesday - He cooks pasta\n\nThursday - Chicken\n\nFriday - he grills burgers\n\nSaturday - order a pizza\n\nSunday - cook something fancy together.  \n\n\nOr whatever works. The same meal every day doesn't work for him, but cooking a unique meal every day doesn't work for you. There's no reason you can't talk and come to an accommodation that - at least somewhat - satisfies both of you.", "If there's no specific arrangement, if he doesn't like it he can cook. Even if he gets home later there is nothing to stop him from putting on a slow cooker overnight or prepping food he enjoys. NTA", "INFO: would it work for the household budget if he picked up dinner for himself on the way home a few days a week?  I would get really tired of eating the same thing every day too, but if he gets home really late I can also understand why he doesn\u2019t want to start cooking his own dinner at that hour.  If a few days a week of takeout would be a budget issue, then you guys should probably work together to find a compromise.", "Info does he pay half for the groceries you use ?", "I am so judging you'd be willing to eat the same food every Day. That's weird af. But your boyfriend should make his own food if he doesn't like it, so NTA", "NTA. Surely he has some time on other days to cook himself food to save for after work.", "NTA  - you are cooking,  he is not.  You dont complain about the food someone else is kind enough to make for you. A home cooked meal everyday is an amazing thing to come home to. \n\nHe can cook for himself,  or buy food on the days he doesnt want what you have made.  Or you guys could team up and meal prep 1 type of meal each.  That way you can alternate each day for a bit more variety.  \n\nI go crazy if i eat the same thing too often so i started a meal prep exchange with some friends.  Everyone preps a week of the same meal,  then we trade each other so we all have a nice mix of meals throughout the week. You can totally do that on a smaller scale for the two of you", "Not inconsiderate because it seems you thought about your bf beforehand, you just chose to go through with your plan anyway. There are other way to tell your bf you don't want to cook for him, YTA", "He needs to make his own food. NTA", "Info: Are you the dedicated cook for the two of you? Meaning, is it kind of a rule that you cook and he does something else in exchange?", " Total YTA. Meal prepping is fine, but keeping the same meals for a week? That's just plain lazy. Get some variety in yur life!", "NTA\nYou meal-prep and cook. He can choose to eat what\u2019s available or figure it out for himself. He is your bf, not your child. No time to cook? Tough luck, eat what\u2019s on the table.\nYou do what works for you, for your budget as well as your time. Time (your time) is as precious as money, invest it in things that make a difference to you and don\u2019t waste it on placating entitled people.\n\nHaving said the above, I meal-prep for my 3yo. I make certain foods (soups, pasta with fresh tomato sauce, baked salmon with steamed veggies etc) for the day and then save 3-4 portions in the freezer and 1 in the fridge so she can have the same thing 2 nights in a row and then switch it with something else. Also works well when I don\u2019t have time to cook. Only the pasta I don\u2019t freeze (takes me 10\u2019 to make fresh), just the tomato sauce because it takes hours to make it with tomatoes from the market.\n\nAgain, I have a toddler and I care for her to have a balanced weekly plan. You have an entitled bf who can sort out his food if he isn\u2019t happy following your plan.", "Yeah, and there is a whole sub about assh*les, which is this one. Nowhere is it said that he was begging or that he ended up eating the same meal multiple times in a row. If there is an understanding that I am cooking for someone, I don't make a dish they can't eat for an entire week. That is called an AH move.", "NTA\n\nHim coming home late is no excuse for him not contributing to the cooking. Like you've already shown: meal prepping resolves that issue, since it doesn't matter at which time of the day you do it. And he's wrong is saying you make the same meal everyday. Quesadillas does not equal nachos. Besides, you're apparently already using a freezer, so that should allow you to 'change up' the meals even more, so I'm not entirely sure what the problem is to begin with? Maybe offer to eat the mac and cheese you mentioned in another comment between the quesadillas and nachos?", "If anything, he\u2019s the A. \nTaking care of food is something that we do for ourselves, and he should be grateful that you go to this lenght to even prepare food and for multiple days also, for you AND him to eat! This is not common in my country, women do not cook, Spoiled men can cook for themselves. \nI cook for my man once a week, because that\u2019s my love language. If he wants something, he is able to make it himself.\nWhen he marries me, then I will prepare more meals for him.\nDon\u2019t do no wifey shiet on a girlfriends salary :* \n\nSo you are def NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
