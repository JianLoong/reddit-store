OP refused saying it's not her problem that roommate has no friends and insisted roommate wear headphones but roommate said headphones were an issue for medical reasons exactly the same as these. OP is being kicked out bc of this. OP claimed roommate was mentally unstable and called the police on roommate for 'standing creepily in the dark' drinking water in the middle of the night and thought was a threatening gesture. Roommate wanted brother present when OP was moving to ensure stuff wasn't stolen and OP thinks this is also a threatening intimidation. OP believes they compromise on the issue by sometimes leaving loudly at 3am, waking roommate up in the process. op also believes they are generous in their actions by doing things like drinking water when roommate won't buy milk for her.
