And unless the clothes are especially damp or smelly or covered in blood, there\u2019s a lot less infectious things on someone\u2019s clothes than someone\u2019s sneeze because a lot of germs die if they\u2019re not in an optimal breeding environment. \n\nchanging clothes because people come in from the outside is way overkill unless OP has a condition that makes him immunocompromised, then that also means his guests need to mask and sanitize like in a hospital clean room. It sounds like a mental health problem especially if changing clothes comes before like putting plastic on couches", "Guests should undress outside the front door then step across the threshold into the clean clothes just to be on the safe side.", "Honestly I can't bring myself to call OP an asshole. I know how severe OCD can get. OP definitely needs therapy.", "Yes, this is the correct answer. I have a sister in law with an  extreme germ phobia and she was this extreme until she got some help for it. Now, she's much happier, much more relaxed and she's much easier to be around, if I'm honest. I always tried to accommodate her, to the best of my ability, because I could see the extreme stress it caused her to think germs were spreading around her in any capacity. Even when my nieces were ill, I would come take care of them for a few days because she couldn't handle the germs. When I pointed out that this extreme phobia was literally taking time away from her children who needed their mom during these times, that's what clicked and made her want to get some help for it. And she's in her early 40's now. Had she gotten this help as young as op currently is, her life would have been much less stressful.", "You can't reasonably expect people to bring clothes or wear a raincoat while sitting on your furniture. If this is something very important to you, and it seems it is, you should consider not having anyone over.\n\nI also think you should consider therapy, and for this reason, NAH", "This is a good solution. I have pretty severe OCD and have been going through similar feelings lately (not being able to deal with \u201coutside clothes\u201d touching furniture, among other things). My solution is to throw a blanket over the couch before my guest/s arrive. I am also actively seeking therapy for this though, and OP would most likely benefit from the same.", ">But also, wouldn\u2019t it be easier to get large throw blankets to put over the sofa when guests come?\n\nYup, I do this as well. I bought a new couch and the fabric is pretty light. My old one was in a beige color and one day it got permanently stained by dark jeans. So I decided to use a large blanket since then when I'm having more guests over.", "How do you know he has no desire for therapy?", "Of anything to ask people to take off shoes is pretty standard. In much of the world. Shoes are the dirtiest thing you've got and track crap all over the floor.", "So you ok with guests trekking mud and dog shit into your house?", "Adding on,\n\nOnce you start extreme germaphobe behavior it only increases.\n\nEspecially if some people, like their family are acquiescing.\n\nOP it is in fact 180\u00b0 the opposite of good for you & healthy to be doing this.\n\nKeeping dirty shoes at the door & not tracking outside in is entirely reasonable. \n\nGetting to the point of expecting your friends/guests to remove their clothes and don plastic bags really should feel NOT OK vs the level of grossed out you are at the thought of germs tracking in.\n\nUnless you live somewhere like Beijing  or Dehli parts of where civil janitorial is non existent, poor sewage and filthy air quality is the norm or parts of many US cities where public services have been gutted and camps of unhoused are dangerously proliferating, your fear of uncleanness is the issue not environmental filth.", "That pesky 0.01%", "And if you did manage to eliminate all bacteria your body literally will not work properly. Like you'd end up with weird skin conditions and wouldn't be able to digest most foods. We need bacteria to function. Most bacteria is benign or actually helpful, in the right circumstances.", "No shoes past the door is just common sense from a cleanliness point of view. I'd never have an issue with that. All sorts of \\*visible\\* stuff falls off shoes, like dried grass and stuff that you'd have to vacuum up all the time. If you track that in just after I've vacuumed I\"m gonna get mad, even though I'll happily walk around the garden barefoot all day.", "no, you simply misunderstood my comment. I don't want to smell someone's feet/shoes while they are in my home with their shoes off.", "There is a singular important part of OCD in terms of making it a disorder and that is having a negative impact on your life - whether the OP is suffering from OCD or something else is irrelevant, because they just lost a friend over their irrational behaviour - and that's clearly not the only negative impact it is having on their life. Whatever disorder they have (and that part is pretty much undeniable) they should be seeking help for it.", "Okay but depending on the age of the couch and Gramgram's skill, there's a good chance that afghan would be more comfortable than whatever the couch itself was made out of.", "Would probably make good virologists if contamination OCD is what it sounds like", "100%. I have OCD and think this way, except I mostly just apply it to myself and not others. I have different cardigans to wear or surfaces to sit on depending on whether I\u2019m wearing inside or outside clothes. It\u2019s definitely realistic, though many OCD sufferers are aware that requests like this are largely irrational and try to manage it internally.", "My Reddit game is 90-95% bullshit with 90% of that being creative writing with an emphasis on attempting humor. It\u2019s hit or miss, much like blasting a clown\u2019s nose at a carnival (or this guy jerk squirting a turkey baster at an open clam at ten paces so he doesn\u2019t get dirty sex cooties on his giggle stick).", "This is the best solution. And therapy.", "i do. 'change clothes at other people's house' because one of my friends *can* get 'sick' \n\ngot a mate extremely allergic to cats, of which i haz two.\n\ni either change in their garage or i can't go in without causing them grief. seriously - they so bad, just being in close proximity to someone who has been in prolonged contact with cats is no bueno.\n\nit's not worth it to put them thru that, and it's really no big deal to change.\n\n(you should see what gets done for them to be able to come to my place . . .)", "This is indeed exactly what I had my entire time in elementary school. I self-treated by switching to sandals in middle school, which *helped* by reducing sweating, but just reduced the effect rather than getting rid of it. \n\nI still struggle a bit with being a natural fungus colony, but at least after getting prescribed an oral antifungal regimen I finally stopped having itchy, smelly feet, and my heels stopped cracking constantly. I do so wear sandals whenever I'm not doing an activity that requires closed shoes, tho, because I'm stuck with the excess sweat for life.", "That's very sensible to be so careful of your friend's safety, but it's not at all the same as OP's irrational and uninformed germophobia.", "I take my shoes off at home and I do the same at other people's houses based upon either their request or the colour of their carpets. If they have light coloured carpets I take off my shoes whether they ask or not. If they have a carpet that you could upend a pizza on and not notice then the shoes stay on unless we're back to them asking for shoe removal.\n\nIf their home is filthy as assholes and they still require me to remove shoes my brain stops working.", "Omg the CARPET RAKE!! As a kid, we bought my Grandparents old house and inherited multi room shag carpet and a big plastic rake to rake the carpet. Oh those wild 70s.\n\nOP... YTA ish... germs are everywhere.

A lot of Asian households do this. Some don\u2019t have washable slippers but get a bunch of (cheap) disposable ones like the ones at hotels. We\u2019re American too.", "Melvindale here. My mother refused to allow us on the company furniture. She did the \"I just want one nice thing\"  line. I hope that poor woman got a nice mansion in heaven.
