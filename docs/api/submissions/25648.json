Consider though, that the rule could easily be construed by others who visit your home as an insult to them, because it indirectly accuses them of being a dirty and/or unhygenic person to the point where immedaite action must be taken to address it in your home (ie the washing of clothes they are wearing).

I have similar rules: no outside clothes on beds, no shoes in the house, wash hands first thing when you walk in etc \nHowever it is unrealistic to expect all temporary guests to adhere to this.

Recall a roommate catching a (begrudged) ride home with a coworker living nearby. Per her, his car seats were covered in plastic & when she exited the vehicle, he jumped out to spray her seat with disinfectant & wipe it down. Please don't be/remain that guy.", "This", "My in laws require that we take our shoes off and I always laugh and think \u201cwhy bother if I\u2019m bringing in dirt / pollen / germs on my clothes??\u201d \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "This", "I would be so offended if a \u201cfriend\u201d insinuated I am so nasty I can\u2019t even sit on the couch.", "I try to be as clean as I can in general but I do think there is a difference between a public place (which will always be a festering germ pool) and someone's home. If I am going to someone's home, I will take a hot shower and head straight there. If they asked me to change my clothes once there, I would do it. I know that I'm clean but they would have no way of knowing for sure.\n\nI typically keep my bathroom very sterile but I also strip down before entering anyways (and jump in the shower afterwards quickly). It doesn't bother me very much though when my guests use the bathroom in their clothes because I scrub it down every day and I have a sign up telling them to close the lid before they flush.", "Or just go 80s grandma style and cover all the furniture in clear plastic?", "Ohhh the plastic covers from the 70\u2019s would come in handy for op. \n\nBut yea, they need therapy to realize that the request is next level. Shoes, yea I can understand. Clothes is not understandable. YTA"]}
