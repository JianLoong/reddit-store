While I was in college I informally used a completely unrelated \"English\" name for 3 years, and while it was easier to introduce myself to new people, it was just not me and felt like I was denying my heritage & culture, so I reverted back to my original name. Plus I love hearing how people butcher my name now. I've got some amazing hilarious responses - think chemical elements, cereal brands, public buildings, global events... I'm always on the lookout for new ones, it's the best ice breaker! Also in my current country there are a lot of multicultural ethnic names I can't pronounce properly first time either, so I don't feel bad when I get theirs wrong because they get mine wrong too. we just learn to break it down into syllables and move along. If it sounds pretty close to my name I don't bother correcting them. there's more important things in life. and I love all the suggestions you gave!

So while petty to give such names I think it's justified and many would have reacted even worse. So NTA.\n\nWindows 10 is my fav.

What you're saying is realistic because the vast majority of individuals from nations that predominately speak English will mispronounce an ethnic name, and it's possible that the child will face prejudice for it. At the same time, if someone \"looks\" non-white enough, the people who would have discriminated against them for their name would still discriminate against them for their appearance, and I assume you wouldn't want to spend time with someone who would look down on you for your identity in the first place; essentially, the name doesn't really matter. \n\nAnother thing is that ethnic names are only hard for non-ethnic people, and if the child is raised bilingual or multilingual, then it's not an issue. A name also stays with you your entire life, to which I would then argue that it would be worth it even if there really was a problem during childhood.
