Plus I love hearing how people butcher my name now. I've got some amazing hilarious responses - think chemical elements, cereal brands, public buildings, global events... I'm always on the lookout for new ones, it's the best ice breaker! Also in my current country there are a lot of multicultural ethnic names I can't pronounce properly first time either, so I don't feel bad when I get theirs wrong because they get mine wrong too. we just learn to break it down into syllables and move along.

What you're saying is realistic because the vast majority of individuals from nations that predominately speak English will mispronounce an ethnic name, and it's possible that the child will face prejudice for it. At the same time, if someone \"looks\" non-white enough, the people who would have discriminated against them for their name would still discriminate against them for their appearance, and I assume you wouldn't want to spend time with someone who would look down on you for your identity in the first place; essentially, the name doesn't really matter. \n\nAnother thing is that ethnic names are only hard for non-ethnic people, and if the child is raised bilingual or multilingual, then it's not an issue. A name also stays with you your entire life, to which I would then argue that it would be worth it even if there really was a problem during childhood.

OP described a situation where their aunt, presumably not from one of the \"very ethnic \\[countries\\],\" enacted at best what was a rude, out of bounds comment, and at worst a racist, prejudiced insult. What the other commenter and I were discussing was that an ethnic name is realistically difficult for many children to have, particularly because they're open to bullying and not knowing better, which might lead them to become uncomfortable and ashamed of their own name. Clearly, it's not the situation you're describing where someone with an ethnic name \"shames\" (assumably) someone from the majority for mispronouncing their name. You have it backwards.\n\n>I also don't make the presumption that, based on the colour of a person's skin, they won't be able to pronounce certain words in English.\n\nGood for you! I agree! Which is why I said that *most* English-speaking natives wouldn't be able to correctly pronounce an ethnic name or language. It just isn't realistic. Assumptions are oftentimes harmful, but generalizations are useful in a situation where we need them to form a conclusion. Within this context, this is all the more true. It is very common for a white person to use someone's name as a reason to be discriminatory, which is why it was a concern both the original commenter and I were discussing. Note how I am not saying all white people; instead, I'm acknowledging that minorities often face prejudice *from* white people, which is a statement that can't be any more true.", "I just asked my half asleep IT boyfriend if we could name our theoretical baby Vista and I have never seen that man move so fast to give me a stink eye \ud83e\udd23", "This is my oldest, MS-DOS, and their younger sibling, Windows 3.1", "Oh, you're talking modern computers, I see!"]}
