My sister Lily (26) is planning a destination wedding soon. She got married on paper years ago and her wedding was canceled due to COVID. She wants to go through with it again this year and I was excited. I\u2019m 17. When she first got married I was 12-13. \n \nI didn\u2019t know it then, but she didn\u2019t plan on inviting me or my twin brother to her wedding. She came over today to ask our mother to help her book the house everyone would stay at and find everything she needs for her wedding.  She was making a list of guests and I realized my twin and I were missing. I mentioned it to her and she ignored me at first.  My mom told her that we are old enough now and to let us come. \n\nMy sister told her (and i quote) \u201cThis is my wedding. I decide who comes or not\u201d. I was confused and that\u2019s when my mom told me she wanted a no kids wedding. There\u2019s, obviously, and huge age gap between us. Since we\u2019re were in that category during her initial plan we weren\u2019t invited. At first I wasn\u2019t offended. But during her first plan my niece (12) and other children younger than me were allowed to go. That pissed me off. \n\nWe argued for a while with her telling my mom she was welcome to stay home if she didn\u2019t like it. That hurt my mom immensely since she\u2019s sacrificed so much for us (she had to quit law school in her final semester). I told her that I didn\u2019t care if I wasn\u2019t invited and told my mom to go. My sister looked satisfied, but my mom asked me why I suddenly didn\u2019t care. I simple told my sister that if and when u get married she wouldn\u2019t be receiving an invite. She proceeded to cry and whine and call me unfair. \n\nMy mom didn\u2019t intervene and simply told us to rethink our decisions and to not ruin our relationship over something silly. I told them  I would reverse my decision if Lily simply invited me. And she refused and called me a \u201cBitter Bitch\u201d before running out of the door. My mom told me she understood why I said that, but I was a bit rude. Her husband called me and told me I was \u201ca spiteful devil\u201d and I cause Lily to have a panic attack.  I feel bad that I caused her to have a panic attack but she was being unfair. AITA? Should I just let her have her way since it\u2019s her wedding?\n\n[UPDATE]\n\nThis will be the only update i make because frankly i don\u2019t plan on dragging this out. they just left and i\u2019m too tired to give proper text so bare with me. My sister apologized to me for what she did when i initially called her out. she did have a panic attack, not because she was mad that i went tit for tat, but the fact that her in laws pressures her not to invite me since they don\u2019t like me. \n\nher husband blamed me after hearing about what happened but apologized realizing it was his parents doing. while apologizing means nothing to me i plan on allowing them to show me how bad they feel (from a distance) until i feel comfortable with them again. \n\nmy BIL also mentioned how they plan on going low contact with his parent due to their constant harassment. my sister decided there\u2019s no need for a wedding since they signed the papers or whatever and it would be a waste of money, and enough trouble has been caused. \n\nmy parents gave them some nice choice words and have set heavy boundaries between BIL and i due to his inappropriate comments. my sister also told him it was unnecessary but if she actually cares is debatable. \n\ni brought up how she treated me and how outside influences aside that there was something else there and as i suspected i was right. she does hate my twin and i saying we\u2019ve done nothing but breathe. however, she felt jealous since we lived the childhood she wished to have. she plans on going to my next therapy session with me and starting her own since she has her own problems. \n\nthanks everyone for your advice, love, and humor when this was stressing me out.", "created_utc": 1690051782, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156rzed/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_wouldnt_invite_her/", "score": 210, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
