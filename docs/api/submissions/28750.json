If she cares so much about your parents she should be footing the bill. Which I highly doubt bc people are always one to talk but never to sign the check.

No money exchanged but they get food.", "Did you manage to break the circle?", "As the parent of an addict, walking that fine line between enabling them or supporting them (emotionally) is painfully difficult. Our funny, intelligent, loving, addicted son lost his battle 5 years ago. I'd give anything to try and walk that line again.", "I'm so sorry you dealt with this. I hope you were able to at least stop your part.", "I would add that if things are truly dire for parents, maybe OP should take parents shopping and pay for it, or send them gift cards for the supermarket, and for other bills, get the info to pay the vendor directly.", "I know he was given a large amount of money to attend a family function and didn't bother to show up. He shat on the people who paid his way and the hosts who made room for him at the last moment.", "How is that OP's responsibility?  She helps her parents who lie to her and take her money under false pretenses.  They could still get help from her - by giving her receipts showing they spent money on food and *their* needs and not enabling her brother.  OP grew up with her brother and knows what his limitations are very well and chooses not to support him with *her* money, while having no issue actually helping her parents.", "I'm missing my own dad today, too. Hugs from an internet stranger.", "You are projecting your own defensiveness about your situation into this situation which is not at all the same and had nothing to do with disabled people.  Stop", "I'm sorry but how do you know that?  You are one person. That is a sample size of one.   That in no way proves that most people that get help are grateful for it.", "u/Beneficial-Math-2300\n\u201cCanuckKevin\u201d was being nasty and trying to make fun of you.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you have to deal with all of that suffering.  \n\nAuto-immune disorders are truly nightmarish.  \n\nI hope you have good, compassionate doctors who stay up on the current research and can relieve your pain.", "More like she didn't want to tip off OP further.

Less than five percent of donations from civilians gets passed on, at least in our location. The goods we stock our food pantry with consists of paid contracts with companies, food donations from local stores, or food donations from damaged truck loads. Very few of the food items from random people actually make it thru the sorting process. Also it\u2019s not like goodwill bc clothes don\u2019t expire or perish and we don\u2019t charge those in need. Everyone who needs help is free to come", "Goodwill recycles the unwearable clothing to keep it out of landfills.  So I don't think that's quite the right comparison where expired food literally is sorted and thrown away.\n\nAnd I've heard that after natural disasters quite a bit of the donated clothing is thrown out because there's no one to sort it or it's the wrong season and unwearable.", "Or, do as she's done and wash her hands of it. Why become a PI or detective just to keep supporting them, when they've clearly used her for something that she's probably made clear was a boundary. I'm sure they're aware of how she feels about her brother, and they lied to her and used her money. It's not her responsibility to find a way to continue supporting them.", "But now they know their food is covered, so that frees up whatever they were going to have for food to give to the brother.\n\nThere is no way OP can help the parents and NOT support the brother, if the parents are going to give money to the brother.", "Then the brother fills the cart, and she pays for it.", "You really aren't getting it, are you? Apparently not just _you,_ /u/kraftypsy/ , but several other commenters too. And since you all are probably too lazy to look up \u201cfungible\u201d, what it means is that any money can be replaced by other money to the same amount. (If you owe me $100, I don't care which exact bills you pay me with, as long as they add up to $100.)\n\nOP putting grocery money on an \u201c Instacart account\u201d or whatever means that the money that previously was in their grocery budget \u2013 money that doesn't consist of earmarked special groceries-only banknotes, but _fungible_ dollars \u2013 can now be given to the brother. Your \u201csolution\u201d doesn't solve that problem at all.", "So very sorry for your loss. However, did you expect his siblings to keep financially supporting him (or you so that you could give him money)?", "Absolutely. They need to be held accountable for the money now.

Only the top comments count.  \n\nIf you're replying to someone else, your comment isn't reviewed by the bot at all.", "Ah whoops, thanks", "There is a way, but it is not going to happen.  If OP knows what the parents income is, the OP could get the parents to hand over all of their income to OP and then OP pays all the parents expenses.  The parents will not agree to that, but it does solve the issue you pointed out.", "Totally agree with this. Anything OP gives them, will find it's way back to her brother.", "This is a small scale model of how generations of foreign aid maintain corrupt social structures.\n\nI'm not saying to stop helping but it does show how difficult it is to ensure that the aid goes directly to those needing it.", "No. I was just feeling empathy for those parents and the poster.", "Your situation is not at all similar to OP's brother's situation. \n\nYou are derailing the thread with your unrelated experience.", "Finally, someone with taste!", "r/nobodyasked", "This is a good solution, but as you said, if they can\u2019t handle even OP\u2019s questions they aren\u2019t likely to be willing to go for it.", "That's financial abuse", "Or financial discipline."]}
