No questions asked. \n\nMy mom asked me for $2,000. I sent it to her. Strangely enough I ran into my brother at a family wedding I had been told he could not afford to attend because it was a destination wedding. Weird.  Funny story he actually missed the wedding because he hooked up with some rando on an excursion and went to their resort. It was our cousin's wedding and my aunt was pissed. She had to make special arrangements to get him included on the trip since he only got the money last minute. She said my mom shouldn't have given him the money if he wasn't even going to show up. \n\nThen she shut up after she saw the look on my face. \n\nI enjoyed the wedding and had a great time. When I got home I went to see my parents. I asked my mom why she had asked for the $2,000. She lied and said something for the house. I asked what. She couldn't say. I told her what my aunt said. I told her and my father that from now on I wanted receipts for any money I gave them. I said I have no problem helping them but I will be damned if I work my ass off for her to give my money to my piece of shit brother. \n\nShe started crying and my dad said that they weren't children and didn't answer to me. I agreed and walked out. \n\nI didn't talk to them for two months. My aunt called me yesterday and told me that my parents were thinking of going to.the food bank since they didn't have any money. I said I had given them $2,000 a couple of months ago and that was more than my family of three spent on food on that time. She said I knew damn well they had given my money to my brother. I told her that he should probably pay them back then.

That is theft by deception. They aren't children, so you should treat them as the adults they claim to be. I've been to a Food Bank. It is a good experience and humbling. It's on them for taking advantage of you. It's on you if you let it continue.", "NTA.  I love you, man!!!!!", "NTA.  I'd stop giving them money directly as well in that scenario, **but** as a compromise I'd take them grocery shopping and pay for the groceries directly, or pay the utility company directly etc. instead of giving them cash.

I get they are your parents but what a toxic relationship for you", "NTA Your parents are right, they aren't children. They lied to you to get money  and then expected more. I'm sorry to say this but it doesn't seem like your parents respect you or care for you outside of being a wallet for them.

Your mom has already shown you she can't be trusted to make good choices when it comes to your brother.

Don't give them money instead give them the things they need so you aren't supporting your deadbeat brother.", "I am guessing that your parents are on a fixed income. Many people have suggested that you pay your parents bills and that way your brother won\u2019t receive the money. The only problem with this scenario is that when you pay their bills, you enable them to give the rest of their money to your brother.

Otherwise, you\u2019ll be continually taken advantage of.", "NTA this was basically The Moment where your parents are going to decide whether they care more about enabling your brother than you and their well-being. They went too far this time and don\u2019t want to admit they were wrong. I doubt you\u2019d actually let them go hungry but that\u2019s not the problem they are up against. They are up against pride - they don\u2019t want to go to a food bank and they don\u2019t want as parents to have to look their adult child in the eye and take the consequences of lying and financially taking advantage. It pricks pride that youll pay a bill but expect a receipt, because it\u2019s embarrassing to not be trusted - and they earned it!\n\nSmall note: if it comes to a point where you are assisting again?

If she cares so much about your parents she should be footing the bill. Which I highly doubt bc people are always one to talk but never to sign the check. Stand your ground and let them suffer a little so they understand. They won\u2019t die over eating some food from the food bank for once", "NTA. If they stop enabling your brother then he might have a slight chance to learn to take care of himself and make something of his life. Odds seem slim based on what you wrote but who knows. \n\nYour aunt has no right to try to assert control over her grown adult niece. She's just promoting more of the disfunction that led to your brother becoming the way he is. \n\nHaving said all that, try to abstract your love for your family apart from the money issues. You can still show your parents and brother you love them while at the same time not feeling like you have any obligation to give them one cent.

Your parents shouldn\u2019t be relying on you to do all of their budget while your brother gets off scot free for everything. That\u2019s messed up!

Money is fungible. Even if the money you give them isn't directly spent on your brother it still subsidizes him.

They don't even feel guilty about this as in their eyes you're the bad daughter for not supporting family and it sounds like nothing you do will ever be enough. If anything your involvement helps them ignore your brother's failings as you pay for the consequences, maybe a couple years of no support/contact from you might force them to reconsider how they've treated you both.", "Honestly, what a painful situation.

Your parents can then budget with their own free cash and if they want to spent it on your brother, it\u2019s on them, not you.", "NTA. There's no doubt at all here. Everyone else is except for you.

Your aunt has no business insulting you, she can provide financial help herself AND it sounds like she knew you wouldn\u2019t want your money going to your brother.

You because you gave the money no questions asked and I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re surprised when you know your mom favours your brother.\n\nBut ultimately NTA - because sounds like everyone knows exactly how you feel about your brother and you don\u2019t HAVE to give money to anyone condition free. When you found out they went behind your back, you added conditions they refused. You have the right to do so. Good for you for standing up to yourself.
