There\u2019s a bit of background information, so I\u2019ll try to be as clear as possible. My fianc\u00e9, Rick (M28), asked me to marry him in early February of this year. I knew he was going to ask, so I already knew who my wedding party would be. So I asked my (who I thought to be) best friend, Kay (F21), to be my maid of honor at the end of March. She happily accepted, but there was a little bit of a problem. Rick asked Steven (M22) and Michael (M23), to be his best men-and Steven is Kay\u2019s ex. They had dated a year, and broke up in beginning of March. Rick and I were kinda caught in the middle of the break up since we are friends with both sides, but from what we understood it was amicable.\n\nKay knew Steven was in the wedding party, and when she accepted she knew she\u2019d have to be around him and Michael, who is Steven\u2019s best friend. At first she was completely fine with it. But then she started to express to me that she was uncomfortable walking with Steven down the aisle. So I asked if she would walk with Michael, since he\u2019s also a best man so it wouldn\u2019t really matter. Kay said no, she doesn\u2019t want to walk with him either because he makes her uncomfortable as well. So I just decided to have her walk with the flower girls and ring bearer to keep the peace.\n\nAfter that request she told me she wouldn\u2019t want to come to our joint bachelorette and bachelor party because she wouldn\u2019t want to be around them or stay in the same house. So I ended up saying that we wouldn\u2019t do a joint one, even though it\u2019s what Rick and I wanted. I just wanted my best friend there for my bachelorette.\n\nAfter I made those adjustments for her at my wedding, everything seemed fine. We would talk about planning and she was great. She was even excited because she started dating someone so she would have a plus one. \n\nBut now it\u2019s December, and she reached out to me around 3 weeks ago and told me she couldn\u2019t be my maid of honor while I was at my job. She claims she\u2019ll be too busy with work and school. I was, and still am, beyond hurt. She has known about my wedding since March, and it\u2019s not until July. I wasn\u2019t even told on a phone call, I was told via social media. After she told me, she has not reached out, but neither have I. \n\nSo my question is-AITA for deciding to not invite her to my wedding? If she\u2019s to busy to be in the wedding party, the  why should I even bother sending her an invite? A couple of people I\u2019ve told said she should still at least be invited, and that I\u2019d be an ahole if I didn\u2019t.", "created_utc": 1702825591, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18kj9c5/aita_for_deciding_not_to_invite_my_maid_of_honor/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This isn't enough notice to reasonably back out of the wedding. When someone tells you who they are, believe them. It won't be the last friendship you grow out of in your life in all likelihood.", "NTA. You made a lot of accommodations for her at your wedding. You went above and beyond. She\u2019s the one who should have been accommodating and simply walked down the aisle with Mike.

Just expect that if you don\u2019t invite her, you\u2019ve basically ended your friendship. Are you comfortable with that?\n\nIf not, I think you invite her to attend. Personally, I think it\u2019s probably a blessing that she\u2019s backed out. You\u2019re able to plan your wedding without the stress of how it impacts her.", "Whatever you decide, NTA.\n\nWhat I would do is to ask her what the real reason is, cause too busy is probably bullshit. And decide the with all the information. But I\u2019m not in your mind so I cannot correctly measure how hurt you are.", "NTA. It seems you consider her your best friend but she does not consider you her best friend. That hurts to realize im sure.\n\nShe made you change all kinds of things to accommodate her insecurities and then bails last minute. \n\nYou could invite her to the wedding and seat her w the camera crew at the very back by the washrooms. Extend as much consideration to her as she did to you.", "NTA you made a lot of accommodations for her when the she could have done things to make planning less stressful for you. The fact that she didn\u2019t even call to explain doesn\u2019t show much thoughtfulness or maturity. Think until the invitations are ready on whether you still want her in your life and whatever you decide is fine.", "NTA. But keep in mind this will probably end the friendship.", "NTA - you have every right to be hurt. Best friends don\u2019t act like this. Find another MOH and find a better friend, that treats you like you matter.", "NTA.  But you should have grace here. Invite her to the wedding and let her decline if that is her choice to do so. Ball is in her court then.", "NTA - yet decide what you want first as not inviting her will most likely be the end of the friendship.  Look at it from all angles.  How long have you been friends, how involved were either of you with meeting your fianc\u00e9e or her Steven? Has she acted this way (self involved) in the past and you ignored it?  Would it help asking her to meet and asking her for her 'whys'? Letting her know you've rolled with being flexible, surprised by the decision, and hurt by the SM vs calling/talking.\"  See how she reacts & answers your questions --it will probably tell you what to do. That conversation might even be decisive enough to tell her on the spot she doesn't need to save the date & have a nice life.  Or you might learn new info where you say there will be an invite, and you only ask that she make a final decision either way when RSVPs are due and changes after that date will be taken personally and may be unrecoverable.", "NTA\n\nBest friends feel very honoured to be MOH. Best friends know it's their job to be supportive of rhe bride. Best friends don't cancel on being MOH via social media. Best friends (especially when given over a year's notice) organise their life so they can be the best MOH they can be.\n\nSo are you even friends at this point? I'm sorry but after reading your post a couple of times I don't think this friendship can be saved. I really hope I'm wrong though.\n\nI wouldn't  do anything hasty. Wait a bit, there's time. If the thought of having her at your wedding regardless still makes you happy and feel good, then invite her. Otherwise let her know why she's not invited anymore.\n\nI wish you all the best for your married life with plenty of good friends around you.", "INFO: Did the relationship between Kay and Steven end badly?

It sounds like the friendship is as good as over anyway.", "NTA, your friend does not sound capable of any semblance of selflessness and only seemed interested in her own comfort/happiness in the decisions involving YOUR important life events. With that said, if maintaining any semblance of a friendship with her is something you\u2019re interested in, it may be wise to send the invite. Her attendance will prove her interest in maintaining the friendship with you. If she doesn\u2019t come, you can comfortably say you tried your best to stay friends even after her inability to step up and put your happiness ahead of her own. No matter what you decide to do, you should be proud of yourself for being a good friend. I wish you all the best and remember to enjoy your wedding day and just roll with it. The day goes by so fast and just remember to have fun, dance your ass off, and remember that it\u2019s a party celebrating you and your love, you owe no one else a MF thing \ud83d\ude06.", "It depends on if you want to continue to be friends with her. Being a part of a wedding party takes up a lot more time than being a guest, so her time issue is not a valid reason to disinvite her from the wedding. If you have decided that you just don't like how she has been acting and you're ready to end the friendship, the NTA for disinviting her.", "NAH\u2026I understand your frustration after you accommodated her twice and \u201cbusy with school and work\u201d 7 months in advance is kind of a weird excuse. \n\nBUT I\u2019m going to give her the benefit of the doubt that  the break up was very painful for her. More so than you realized.", "NTA dump her from the wedding and your life. Enjoy your day ..have a wonderful wedding and make sure you tell your husband who the boss after the wedding....kidding", "NTA\n\nGradually, it seems like she has been making your wedding about herself. I mean not even wanting to be in the same house as her ex and his best friend? And it is so shitty to inform the bride through social media that you won\u2019t be her MOH. Honestly, it seems there\u2019s something deeper going on here", "NTA no matter which way you go.  You actually made a lot of concessions for her\u2026which I would think you can now change back to what you actually want (combo bachelor party).  \n\nI have to wonder if this is some kind of friendship test.  She\u2019s given you what\u2019s essentially a BS excuse since the wedding is not until July.  I suspect you\u2019re actually supposed to fall all over yourself by begging her to stay in the wedding.  I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she was waiting for you to make the first move.\n\nYou basically need to decide where you want the relationship to go.  There\u2019s a lot of time between now and when invites will go out for a July wedding, so you have time to see if she\u2019s even willing to salvage the friendship.  I would definitely wait for her to make the first move.  You are, after all, hip deep in wedding plans and having to replace your MOH as well.  She\u2019s the one who put the brakes on\u2026after you had been more than accommodating about her demands (and yes, they were demands) concerning **your** wedding.  \n\nI\u2019d probably send her an invite no matter what just so I\u2019d have the high road.  By inviting her anyway, you\u2019re demonstrating that you\u2019re not being resentful or petty about her pulling out of the bridal party, making you a reasonable and understanding person.  But I\u2019d probably also have a designated \u201cbouncer\u201d who would monitor her if she came so as to head off drama.  Odds are, if she doesn\u2019t reach out to you in the next couple of months, she\u2019s probably not coming to the wedding.  But you\u2019ll have a clearer picture in your mind about where you want the friendship to end up\u2026trash heap or salvage pile\u2026and make your choice accordingly.", "I\u2019m honestly not sure. I\u2019m still really hurt, and don\u2019t want to make a decision off my emotions.", "Yeah, Kay was making the wedding about her self \n\nNta is you don't want her there", "If you\u2019re not sure yet, hold off on deciding about her invitation for a few more weeks. If she doesn\u2019t get an invitation, the friendship will be over.\n\nEither way you decide, NTA though."]}
