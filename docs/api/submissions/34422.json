But, it does sound like she wants to be there for you and not let you isolate yourself. This may be a blessing. See if you have it in you to let her come and see you in a vulnerable state. Let her take care of you if you can.", "100%. I just feel so shitty doing so. And I\u2019ve tried doing so in a way where she\u2019d get the hint, but she doesn\u2019t really get it lol", "Excellent script!", "I know that\u2019s her intention. But it\u2019s a bit different when someone comes to stay at your house. I do not want her to come and mope with me, or stay cooped up in the house for 4 days, but I\u2019m not in the mood to go take her out either. It\u2019s different how people think in their head will be, but the reality is, she\u2019s still a guest. You know?", "She probably feels like she's being supportive.  YOu may have to say, look I appreciate you wanting to come to support me but the truth is, I just can't have you stay here, I am not wanting to entertain anyone at all.'\n\nDoes she have someone else in town she can stay with? If there is no other reason to come, just forward her the cost of the ticket.", "This is the issue. You need to be direct with her and tell her now is not a good time for a visit & to reschedule.", "It\u2019s worse to hint. She seems to think that you want company but feel you wouldn\u2019t be a good host and she loves you and doesn\u2019t care if you don\u2019t entertain her. She would probably feel awful if she came and made you feel worse instead of better. So tell her directly instead of hinting.", "I do know when my mother died suddenly & unexpectedly I just wanted to hide in my room with my dog. My family lives out of state & a friend invited herself over & expected nothing from me. Took care of everything til family arrived & just listened. Was there quietly whenever I did need her. I thought I didn\u2019t, but it turned out she was right", "That\u2019s the perspective I\u2019m attempting to see, she has the best intentions for me. It\u2019s just a lot emotionally to deal with, including someone being in your house.", "You know her is she the type to sit & cry with you,  giving a hug or just being there cause she knows your really hurting or is she the type to use your house as a hotel & not cancel her \u201cvacation\u201d. Please understand I mean no offense to you or your friend", "Oh no no. I know she wants to come to help. I just feel shitty and am not really in the mood for anyone lol", "Personally from my experience I would let her come. Sounds like she will know when she is needed & leave you be. I was numb  at first & couldn\u2019t think straight."]}
