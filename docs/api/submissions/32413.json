The guilt of feeling you\u2019ve \u201cfailed\u201d or \u201cabandoned\u201d the disabled person for being able to do stuff they can\u2019t can be really crushing, and no disabled person likes feeling that a loved one is missing out on important experiences.\n\nSo, if your kids are crestfallen about not going, this might be a year to compromise and create some special couple time for you two while they\u2019re away, but if they also want to keep the immediate family together for the holiday celebrations I think you should stick to your guns and are absolutely NTA.", "Why trip ?

And it would absolutely be something the parents should have discussed BEFORE booking this.\n\nI'm gonna be honest, the adaptive ski equipment looks really neat and I'm sure there are tons of people who would be great at it, but I am not even a wheelchair user and I look at them and go, \"Yeah, no way in hell I could manage that.\" I would absolutely, 100 percent hurt myself. Unless he's already pretty active with adaptive sports, it would be wild of them to even assume he'd be interested in that without so much as asking.\n\nBut the fact that it doesn't sound like the lodging accommodations are accessible either pretty much sucks and it's really thoughtless. My first thought when booking a family holiday stay would be, can this accommodate everybody? We have several people with mobility issues in my family and I'd never book something without verifying that it was accessible, talking with the people who would be affected, and then be like, welp, just stay home and send the kids.\n\n> But it\u2019s not happening anytime soon, because 6 year old doesn\u2019t want to do a vacation with just one parent.\n\nYeah, I don't think the kids are gonna be eager to ditch their dad on Christmas. This was just really poorly thought out, and it seems like the parents realize now how thoughtless they were and instead of admitting it, are doubling down to save face.", "Or better yet, talked to OP's husband about it first to see if that's even something he'd be interested in?", "Ok rescheduling Xmas due to work schedules is one thing, but doing it so you can have \u201ckid-free time\u201d is incredibly selfish. Especially considering that if the grandparents are willing to take the kids for Xmas vacation they\u2019d likely take them for another random weekend. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s \u201cChristmas or never be alone with your husband again!!!!\u201d You\u2019re just choosing to prioritize date night over a magical family holiday, which is and always has been more important to children than parents for a long time. It\u2019s not about \u201ctake that date night sis!\u201d It\u2019s about realizing that Christmas is important to your children, and likely they won\u2019t want to spend it away from their parents. And the fact that the parents want to spend it away from the kids? That\u2019s sad. And to a growing child? That\u2019s heartbreaking.", "Your response was aggressive and rude. What you\u2019re saying is you expect your parents to plan and pay for your vacation yearly instead of helping them in any way, shape or form. Maybe you should book and pay for your own accommodations moving forward.", "Yep it is exactly what she\u2019s done.", "[removed]", "[removed]", ">The suggestion itself wasn't terrible\n\nAnd yet\n\n>The suggestion was terrible\n\nSure you do.", "Except it's *Christmas*. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't want my kids off on the slopes without me while I sit around twiddling my thumbs. Any other holiday, maybe - Christmas? Nope. \n\nIf you think about the fact that the parents' knee jerk reaction was to say 'well just send the kids', it sounds like they may have been angling for that in the first place, which is not cool or okay.", "I agree with you though. Good parents would want their kids to enjoy a fun activity even if they weren't able to partake in it themselves. They would still be there with them and could cheer them on.\n\nMy grandpa did that exact thing when I was very young and I appreciate him for that.", "People really don't see what they say until you recontextualize it sometimes.\n\nBeing disabled myself, I've gotten good at showing people exactly what they are saying when they say what they do.\n\nI am able to walk - but use a cane sometimes.  The number of times I had people tell me \"if I had a cane I'd .....\" and it's usually something awful.\n\nMy other disabilities are mostly invisible.", "And I know I\u2019m very direct with my words. I don\u2019t sugar coat things or expect people to read between the lines. If they don\u2019t go, then a family tradition is changing. As someone else said there are many slopes that offer accommodations for those in wheelchairs. There is a possibility this can happen and everyone can spend the holidays together as they always have. As someone who is often limited on what I can do physically, I do not want my family to miss out on opportunities even if they don\u2019t always include me but in this instance there is a likelihood that everyone can be included.", "yes\u2014this. If they had wanted to, they could\u2019ve planned it this way\u2014but they didn\u2019t.", "So you would be ok with 2 of your kids not being with you for Christmas? What would you tell the other two? Does the 5 year old spend Christmas with mom and dad or grandma and grandpa? What happens at 10pm Christmas Eve when the 8 year old has a melt down because they want to with their parents for Christmas and then they are miserable the rest of the trip.", "\"over a magical family holiday, which is and always has been more important to children than parents for a long time.\"\n\nIt's not one or the other Xmas Eve/day is meaningless on its own. If you sit around and don't do anything on that day (no lights/decorations/no gifts/fancy food) it is just another normal mom/Tues/ etc... \n\nSo the magical family holiday can be had at anytime if you choose to do it. \n\nDo the tree, lights, decorations, fancy meal, and gifts on Saturday December 30, and it is just as magical as doing it on Monday December 25th.", "I\u2019m sorry you chose to interpret it that way.", "Your reading comprehension has issues.", "Aaahhh, changing the point of complaint when challenged, instead of conceding a point. Always fun to get to this point.\n\nWhich comment shows a temper tantrum. Blocking you does not count.", "Not if they\u2019re all skiing and staying in a different house.", "Well the grandparents should have thought about that when making accommodations. They\u2019ve always known her husband is in a wheelchair. Them not even caring that she and her husband couldn\u2019t come and saying just send the kids doesn\u2019t seem like they care much about all the family.", "\u201c\u2026.. people you love?\u201d\n\nPeople who don\u2019t want her husband there.", "My perspective has always been: Her parents giving her the suggestion wasn't terrible of them, even if the idea was a terrible/moronic/bad one.\n\nThe issue has always been their reaction to OP's response.", "I used to be in a chair, but now I can walk short distances and I'm too stubborn to use a cane although I should. My disabilities are invisible now and I get a lot of judgemental looks and comments when I use a disabled parking space (even though I have a badge) and disabled toilets as I struggle with stairs.\n\nI feel your pain.", "If I believe they would have fun , be happy and safe yes.  You're saying the negatives but what if  8 year old and 5 year old love grandma and grandpa and you knew they would enjoy going.  You knew they are in good hands with family who can handle if they have any problems. So yea if I truthfully believed it would bring my child happiness I'll be ok with it.", "And that would be fine and dandy *if OP and her husband* wanted it that way (and the kids were OK with that) for some reason other than being excluded from the plans because of husband's mobility needs. \n\nWhen the big magical holiday excludes the parents of the children involved, having Christmas another time with the parents screams to me \"2nd class Christmas\", in a way that feels very different than just rescheduling the day for everyone. At least in my family, we've celebrated \"Christmas\" on various days that weren't the 24/25th ... but so that *everyone possible could attend*, not so that some part of the family could do their thing with our child that excluded us!", "And this comment solidifies YTA. You\u2019re rude and entitled.", "Surely the issue was the exclusion of op\u2019s husband? That would be enough for me to shoot them down in flames if I were op. Their suggestion of taking the kids was just the cherry on top and just underscored their selfishness and disregard for op and her husband\u2019s feelings, especially when they resorted to calling them bad parents because they didn\u2019t get their way. I\u2019d rip them to shreds then go nc."]}
