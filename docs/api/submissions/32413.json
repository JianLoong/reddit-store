Also you shouldn\u2019t split up your immediate family for Christmas.", "My dad has mobility challenges, so we absolutely plan our get-together and outings with that in mind. It\u2019d be incredibly cruel and/or ignorant to do otherwise. Absolutely NTA.", "NTA.", "NTA. They are bad grandparents if they are happy to separate their grandchildren from their parents on Christmas, due to their (probably) deliberate exclusion of their father.", "NTA. Your family sucks.", "NTA", "NTA You only get to spend a number or Christmases with your kids before they grow up and have their own families. After that they will put their families first, it\u2019s the natural order of things. Enjoy this Christmas with your husband and kids. Your family didn\u2019t consider your husband\u2019s accessibility needs, you don\u2019t have to give up your kids for the holiday. You can offer to visit with the kids another time. Pretty obnoxious of your parents to assume they have rights to your kids", "NTA They made their choice and can live with the consequences.\n\nYou could take advantage of this and visit his family instead, or just do your own thing with the kids.", "Like hell I\u2019d let a 1yo be away from me for any real length of time. NTA", "NTA.\nIn some ways it was nice of them to offer to take the kids and give you some peace, but your refusal should have been the end of it - they could surely understand that christmas with your one year old might be something that you would want to mark together.\n\n It wasn't great of them to plan something that your husband couldn't participate in and they should have been prepared for the potential outcomes in doing so. You're perfectly within your rights as good parents to want your family to be together for Christmas and they should respect that without name- calling.\n\nAs a suggestion, If your parents believe it should be something your collective kids would enjoy, why don't they cancel the booking, join you for Christmas and then take the kids skiing next winter or later this winter (not sure how American school holidays work). It'll be a lot more constructive than fighting over a time when being together matters more than where you are.", "NTA, good on you for being on your hubby's side!!  I would watch any alone time with these people with your kids as they may say things about how mom and dad won't let them go and tell them you want to go type b.s.", "seems pretty bullshit that they wouldn't take him into account when making their plans.   Consult you guys.  We've done that in the past with christmas and general vacations.  The families involved discuss.  Sometimes flags are thrown on certain destination and we figure something else out.  Surely there are other places they could have chosen.  \n\nRegardless, NTA.  \n\nINFO: \n\n1) did they really use the term \"bad parents\"?   Wow\n\n2) I understand their desire to see the grandkids, and I do understand that perhaps a \"do your own thing\" can be attractive,  but do they seriously not understand that YOU want to see YOUR OWN kids at christmas too?  OR that \\*gasp\\* they may want to be with you as well?", "NTA They planned something your husband absolutely cannot attend and then expect you to send your children? No. That's ridiculous.", "Oh, fuck no!", "Goodgodalmighty, what is wrong with your parents? Picking a destination that your husband can\u2019t get to is the ultimate insult to him and you. And to then expect you to send your kids there for Christmas without their parents? Look up the definition of obtuse and you\u2019ll see your parent\u2019s pictures..", "NTA\n\nYou spend Xmas with your husband and kids. If it's possible to include more family great. But husband and kids are the minimum. You're not going to separate from your kids on Xmas just because they couldn't be considerate of your husband.", "NTA - The suggestion itself wasn't terrible, other people could have looked at this as a chance for a romantic getaway with their husband, free from the stresses of the holiday..\n\nYour parents are free to spend the holiday however they want. They extended an invitation, you are allowed to decline. The fact that they kept pushing you and got upset that they didn't get their way makes them TA.", "NTA, your parents are being unreasonable.", "NTA. For Christmas, they want to take away your kids, who bring you joy. They are bad parents.", "Info:  Do your kids want to go?", ">a mountain/ski resort that is largely inaccessible\n\nI.N.F.O.\n\nWhat ski resort is inaccessible? Obviously he probably won't ski or go on backwoods trails, but a resort generally has a LOT of other activities and areas that would be accessible.\n\nEdit: NTA based specifically on lack of accessible bedrooms and housing. I still think a ski resort in itself is not a bad idea. Not every activity has to be shared and lots of ski resorts and mountainous areas are wheelchair accessible these days.", "NTA, your husband's disability and accessibility needs are a known factor that they chose to disregard. Asking him to spend Christmas alone or without his children is unacceptably rude. Plenty of ski resorts have better accessibility and alternative activities, they could have chosen a different venue. Or they could have chosen to get the family together for a winter outing that was not on Christmas, so the kids could have fun skiing without missing Christmas with their mother and father. Your family sounds super unreasonable and passive-aggressive, I'm wondering if this is not the first time they've done something like this.", "Absolutely NTA. Your family comes first, obvs", "They want you to send a 1 year old over, I mean sending the 5 and 8 year olds is bad enough but a 1 year old. That\u2019s insane", "Nta plan a vacation when they do there's somewhere fun.", "NTA. It is not their children. I'm surprised you wrote on here for reassurance and that they have the gal to guilt trip you. This isn't during an ordinary weekend but Christmas. If I'm being accused of being a bad parent because I want to spend Christmas with my entire family, especially since my husband wouldn't be able to partake in activities and would have issues with basic mobility then strong boundaries need to be made. They also didn't have the sense to ensure that the location was accessible to your husband further not being inclusive at all. That is disgusting. No one can tell you what to do, but you are a grown adult and no one should steamroll you when it comes to your immediate family, especially extended family members and parents!", "NTA your husband\u2019s accessibility needs are not new and should be something that they factored in when booking  \n\nYour parents sound entitled. So you as parents should forgo spending time with your children so that they can see them. Mental", "NTA. They should\u2019ve been more thoughtful before they booked anyway, and then the whole thing about sending the kids? That\u2019s pretty oblivious. They could take the kids on a no-parents ski trip another time\u2014this is Christmas.", "NTA. \n\nThey've excluded you, not the other way around.", "NTA. Your nuclear family comes first. If they want to have an Alpine holiday, they'll do it without you and yours.", "NTA - when it's a family event, all family members should be able to be there.  A member of your family isn't able to make it, so it's natural that you'd rather do something all together.\n\nYour parents are able to plan a party that isn't wheelchair acceptable, but they'll have to accept that it means your family won't be there.", "NTA- demand accessibility and inclusion. It is so much easier for you to advocate for him than it is for him to advocate for himself at some times. This is what people with disabilites need from the people around them. Inclusion and accessibility is not something you say 'thanks' for. It is something you demand.", "NTA, they chose the location knowing your husband wouldn't be able to come or at least come and fully participate but want you to spend time without your kids during the holidays and then have the stones to get pissy when you say no, they're being aholes. I would also avoid letting the kids talk to them until the trip happens cause whose to say they won't tell the kids so they can guilt trip you into letting them go.", "NTA, this is amazing. Of COURSE NTA. They've excluded your husband from Christmas and their solution is oh that's OK, you can just split up your entire family for the holidays?!  \n\n\nDo they have a problem with your husband? Because honestly, I almost feel like this would be \\*less\\* awful if they've done it on purpose than if they've been \\*that level\\* ignorant towards him and your whole family", "NTA. You don't send your kids away, especially at Christmas, because your parents chose an inaccessible place. \n\nAnd I guess they don't consider your husband family if they can't accommodate him during arguably the biggest family holiday of the year. They can go skiing another time.\n\nETA: It's laughable they called you bad parents. The only way that's a true statement is if they were looking in a mirror when they said it.", "Nta", "NTA", "1) they did. \n\n2) apparently not!!!!", "Makes me wonder if that was their plan.", "Not without us over Christmas, no\u2014it\u2019s the kind of thing the two older kids would really enjoy under different circumstances but not alone over a major holiday for our family.", "It\u2019s a largely mountainous area and the focus for my family will be on skiing and other activities my husband can\u2019t participate in, so even if there\u2019s other activities he COULD do he would still be left out, if that makes sense.", "Definitely this. It sounds like they intentionally wanted to exclude the husband.\n\nNTA", "I don\u2019t think they do! They\u2019ve always typically been considerate of his needs, and have always seemed to like him, so it took us aback.", ">It\u2019s a largely mountainous area\n\nYes, that doesn't mean there aren't accessible amenities and activities. For example, Zion national park is super mountainous, but has a paved accessible path through the main valley. Whistler BC and Keystone CO are both very mountainous ski locations, but the ski resorts have accessible housing and amenities like heated pools, spas and restaurants. So I'm unclear on why you decided it would be unaccessible or that all the family activities would exclude him.\n\nDo you normally spend all Christmas together? Like, does everyone just chill together and not go out in various groups to do various things or take turns cooking?", "I don't know where you are but most resorts in the US have accessible guided skiing for wheelchair users and other people with mobility challenges, as well as options for other types of disabilities. It's super fun, if your husband would be interested in that sort of thing. If the resort does not provide it, there are private companies that provide handicap accessible skiing (the skiier sits in a chair on a ski and his guided by a ski instructor by a harness, my aunt does it all the time.) \n\nSame for sledding/inner tubing/etc. \n\nI live in a very popular ski area and have a son with mobility based special needs and all the resorts in my state have been amazing with options for him to participate.", "...then no one should be more horrified than them that they've excluded your husband out of sheer ignorance! They owe all of you a huge apology here - you haven't denied them Christmas with their grandkids, they've done that themselves", "\u201cwhy you decided\u201d \n\nbecause the family focus is on skiing, and the place they want to stay is up a mountain and not in town. \n\nYes, it\u2019s normally spent together.", "thank you! i will look into this!", "I'm going with NAH. Up a mountain doesn't mean inaccessible, and you haven't actually said what makes it inaccessible (only stairs? tiny bathroom without handholds? no paved or sufficiently level areas to get to and from the rental?). And frankly I don't see why this would be an unenjoyable family Christmas. I absolutely do not ski, but a ski resort is still a beautiful place to hang out, and meals and evenings would likely still be together.", "Look up the ski resort or call and ask about adaptive skiing for a wheelchair user. I have been skiing for a long time and there are multiple versions that I have seen. If the resort does not have an option available a nearby rental place might and the resort will have to accommodate regarding lifts. The adaptive skis resemble a bike.", "Please look into other options. I\u2019m shocked your husband would rather have the kids miss out on this opportunity. NTA either way but maybe he can find a good book while the kids are on the slopes. I\u2019m not in a wheelchair but there\u2019s lots of things I can\u2019t do but I wouldn\u2019t want my family to miss out. Parents are definitely AH for even considering asking to take the kids without you for Christmas.", "only stairs (no bedrooms downstairs) unevenly paved/poorly paved roads, and not a lot of other activities to participate in around the area.", "Okay those are serious problems. But why are you saying in another comment that you'll look into accessible skiing options if the housing is a huge issue?", "For the future; if he wants to try skiing\u2014not for this particular issue at hand. We are not going to Christmas with my parents period!", "Did they say where they expected him to sleep without ground floor bedrooms?", "they did not. there\u2019s not even a pull out couch. the floor, i guess? which is not feasible for him (ie an air mattress wouldn\u2019t work because of his specific type of spinal cord injury). i think they planned this and didn\u2019t consider the accessibility issues until afterward."]}
