I don\u2019t step over him, I warn people in my house not to step over him (and watch him closely), and if I have him out in public, he is not ever put in the way of an aisle or walkway. This isn\u2019t hard. ESH, but dog owner sucks way more than OP. OP may just be ignorant to some dogs not loving being stepped over, and they didn\u2019t really have another way out.

It's perfectly OK to step over them, though I would have given a quick 'sorry, I'm just gonna..' \n\nIf the dog is nervous, then it should be safely tucked out of the way.

Emotional support animals are not a protected group and the abuse of that title to get poorly or not even trained at all animals into restaurants is obnoxious as hell.", "Eh, I feel that the animal blocking the pathway is more an obvious barrier against OP and not OP provoking the dog.

Dog vs human logic.", "There is no certification requirement for service animals.\n\nThe Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) is a law not an organization.", "I mostly agree, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the situation here - they were on the patio and a lot of breweries allow dogs, at least outside, without any kind of certification.

There's plenty of dog owners with really well trained dogs that are simply their pets and are really respectful of everyone around them. Then there's also the other portion of the population that just doesn't care and ruins it for everyone else. I'm willing to bet (based on my experience seeing the bs people would pull when I was in the service industry) there are more people that don't care than there are people like you who are courteous considering how much dog poop drama I've seen on this site. Dogs are family but at the end of the day, they're not people and they always pose a potential risk that I'd rather not take in a public setting with a lot of distractions and strangers.", "Yeah unfortunately lots of dumbasses out there who think a bully breed makes them look tough", "Good point.
