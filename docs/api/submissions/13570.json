This was meant to be in response to a comment, not a stand alone comment.\n\nI don't think the answer at that point is to ban dogs outside of ADA certified ones carte blanche.\n\nThe restaurant employees should be enforcing the standard that dogs cannot block walk ways. Both for the convenience of their guests but also their own safety when doing their jobs. Just like with any guest, if you cannot behave within the spectrum of acceptable behavior, you will be asked to leave. \nSoon enough, the expectation that dogs should be out of the way of walkways becomes as routine a restaurant behavioral expectation as the well-known \"No shirt, no shoes, no service\" adage. \n\nPersonally, I think the US is in a period, in many places, of transition when it comes to expectations regarding the presence, training, and behavior of dogs. \n\nFor example- in the 90's and earlier, it was really common to have a family dog that also had basically *no* training outside of potty training and basic leash training, and it was *very* uncommon to see dogs in settings outside of maybe parks, hiking and camping areas, and people's homes and yards. \nIf your dog obviously wasn't trained, as long as it wasn't biting or attacking people, many people didn't care that much.\n\nAs we see more people getting dogs, and more people viewing their dogs as family members instead of simply pets to be kept in yards and in homes, we're seeing that expectation regarding acceptable levels of training changing and being raised. \n\nI like to see dogs involved in many aspects of life, including being at restaurants. I even like to see them off leash in places like parks and on hiking trails. I got used to viewing it as a very normal thing in places like Munich, Germany where they are overall very well-trained and socialized.\nSo I'm hopeful about the shifting attitudes in the US regarding training dogs for public life.", "NTA.  If a dog is that reactive, they shouldn't be in a restaurant.", "Esh. Right or not, its not going to matter if you get bit or attacked. And it wouldn't be the dogs fault. At all.

This wasn\u2019t a small dog, and it wasn\u2019t a small shit.\n\nThe dude looked both ways and went along to the outside area without picking it up.  He never came back to pick it up.\n\nI saw the poor cashier come to the front and clean it up and it was one of the most inconsiderate things I\u2019ve seen.", "I'd take it one step further and say dogs should be let at home. What possible reason is there to bring your dog to the pub?", "The owner shouldn\u2019t have had his dog in the aisle in the first place and should\u2019ve moved it when he saw someone approaching. The selfishness and entitlement of dog owners has gotten out of control.", "Why should he blast the brewery for the actions of another patron?", "He didn't step on it. Reread the post.", "If someone brings a dog to a brewery that would bite someone just for stepping over it, they're the A.", "Yea, but like, it doesn\u2019t matter if you are in the right after you are missing a testicle or two", "Amen to that brother. I\u2019ve had enough close calls with overly excited cats crawling around my lap that I\u2019m not taking chances with an unknown pets pointy bits getting anywhere close to my junk.", "I guess this is something you need to be a dog owner to understand, but in dog language moving over their head, whether trying to step over them or even pat them on the head from directly in front of them, is an aggressive/dominant action. If the dog is well trained it doesn't matter, but if it's not then they absolutely can take it the wrong way and freak out. \n\nIn either case OP is definitely NTA, if the dog was a risk for reacting the owner never should have had him in public in the first place - not to mention the dog owner chirping OP as he tried to leave. \n\nThat said as a lesson learned from this situation, it is always better to go around a dog rather than over it, and if that isn't possible, talk to the owner first before stepping over the animal just to be safe, as you can 100% not be an AH from a human perspective and still have a ton of puncture wounds from an animal (who never should have been in public) misreading your actions and responding to you as a threat.", "Some dogs are service animals. Literally tools for disabled people. They go (almost) everywhere their person goes.", "Dogs can be unpredictable. It's still a stranger just looming over them. Common sense should tell you not to approach an unfamiliar animal in a way that could distress them for your own safety.\n\nYeah the dog owner would be wrong. But you're still the one that got bit.", "Most *responsible* dog owners...", "That doesn't mean all owners are responsible. I wouldn't risk being bitten by stepping over a dog I don't know.", "Ok yes service animals definitely. I should have clarified i meant regular old pet dogs.", "Yea, but the question here is who is the A, not who made the safest decision.", "> unless they're ADA certified\n\n\nTheir is no such certification or liscencing for service animals in the US", "There is no \u201cADA certification\u201d.", "There's no such thing as anADA certified service animal. There is no legitimate certification for service animals.", "Unfortunately though it's illegal to ask for proof a lot of people just buy the vests and say that their dogs are service dogs when they're not", "I don't think the answer at that point is to ban dogs outside of ADA certified ones carte blanche.\n\nThe restaurant employees should be enforcing the standard that dogs cannot block walk ways. Both for the convenience of their guests but also their own safety when doing their jobs. Just like with any guest, if you cannot behave within the spectrum of acceptable behavior, you will be asked to leave. Soon enough, the expectation that dogs should be out of the way of walkways becomes as routine a restaurant behavioral expectation as the well-known \"No shirt, no shoes, no service\" adage.\n\nPersonally, I think the US is in a period, in many places, of transition when it comes to expectations regarding the presence, training, and behavior of dogs.\n\nFor example- in the 90's and earlier, it was really common to have a family dog that also had basically no training outside of potty training and basic leash training, and it was very uncommon to see dogs in settings outside of maybe parks, hiking and camping areas, and people's homes and yards. If your dog obviously wasn't trained, as long as it wasn't biting or attacking people, many people didn't care that much.\n\nAs we see more people getting dogs, and more people viewing their dogs as family members instead of simply pets to be kept in yards and in homes, we're seeing that expectation regarding acceptable levels of training changing and being raised.\n\nI like to see dogs involved in many aspects of life, including being at restaurants. I even like to see them off leash in places like parks and on hiking trails. I got used to viewing it as a very normal thing in places like Munich, Germany where they are overall very well-trained and socialized. So I'm hopeful about the shifting attitudes in the US regarding training dogs for public life.", "But there are a ton of illegitimate ones that have done a good job of convincing the general populace that certifications are required. I hate them more than I hate the people who call to tell me my SSN is being suspended.", "It won't, because people who take potentially reactive dogs into stressful situations don't think this advice is about them. \n\nResponsible owners of anxious or otherwise potential bite risks don't need to be told.", "You sound like one of those idiots that walks into traffic and is like \"What?!  Pedestrians have the right of way!\" Sure, you may be legally right but you just got hit by a car/bit by a dog/etc.  Yes, of course an aggressive dog shouldn't be in a restaurant but it certainly happens and telling someone they shouldn't step over a strange dog is 100% the correct advice.  You can't assume the dog is well behaved just like I don't assume someone approaching an intersection is going to stop.  I make sure they're slowing down first and that they see me. It's the same precaution as not stepping over a strange animal."]}
