This was meant to be in response to a comment, not a stand alone comment.\n\nI don't think the answer at that point is to ban dogs outside of ADA certified ones carte blanche.\n\nThe restaurant employees should be enforcing the standard that dogs cannot block walk ways. Both for the convenience of their guests but also their own safety when doing their jobs. Just like with any guest, if you cannot behave within the spectrum of acceptable behavior, you will be asked to leave. \nSoon enough, the expectation that dogs should be out of the way of walkways becomes as routine a restaurant behavioral expectation as the well-known \"No shirt, no shoes, no service\" adage. \n\nPersonally, I think the US is in a period, in many places, of transition when it comes to expectations regarding the presence, training, and behavior of dogs. \n\nFor example- in the 90's and earlier, it was really common to have a family dog that also had basically *no* training outside of potty training and basic leash training, and it was *very* uncommon to see dogs in settings outside of maybe parks, hiking and camping areas, and people's homes and yards. \nIf your dog obviously wasn't trained, as long as it wasn't biting or attacking people, many people didn't care that much.\n\nAs we see more people getting dogs, and more people viewing their dogs as family members instead of simply pets to be kept in yards and in homes, we're seeing that expectation regarding acceptable levels of training changing and being raised. \n\nI like to see dogs involved in many aspects of life, including being at restaurants. I even like to see them off leash in places like parks and on hiking trails. I got used to viewing it as a very normal thing in places like Munich, Germany where they are overall very well-trained and socialized.\nSo I'm hopeful about the shifting attitudes in the US regarding training dogs for public life.", "NTA.

If your dog obviously wasn't trained, as long as it wasn't biting or attacking people, many people didn't care that much.\n\nAs we see more people getting dogs, and more people viewing their dogs as family members instead of simply pets to be kept in yards and in homes, we're seeing that expectation regarding acceptable levels of training changing and being raised.\n\nI like to see dogs involved in many aspects of life, including being at restaurants. I even like to see them off leash in places like parks and on hiking trails. I got used to viewing it as a very normal thing in places like Munich, Germany where they are overall very well-trained and socialized.

Or like your buddy said, just wait for the other path to open up. \n\nIf that dog had bit you, it likely would have needed to be put down, which would be your fault for invading its space. I can't imagine even a friendly or well-trained dog wanting to be stepped over, sheesh", "NTA. I am a dog lover and take my dog everywhere. You should never leave your dog in an area that humans are going to walk.", "NTA. Shit happens. No big deal.", "In terms of the interpersonal conflict, the dog owner was TA. Your behavior was not smart and was potentially dangerous, but it wasn't malicious.\n\nFrom the dog's perspective, you were a major TA, which is why it barked at you. \n\nIf it comes up again, tell the handler to get their dog out of the aisle, or go around and on your way back tell an employee that the person with the dog is creating a hazard.", "Look. Our guy is a rescue. If I take him to a cafe or similar he lies under the table. He's NEVER in the way.\nNTA But DON'T step over the dog. Talk to the owner.", "NTA. The owner should not have their dog impeding access like they. They\u2019re the asshole.", "This is a management request.  You allow animals in the restaurant, if I trip and fall I\u2019ll sue, if I get bitten I\u2019ll sue.  Keep the god dam animals away from anyone and everyone.", "NTA. When you gotta go, you gotta go. Dude should have had his dog move when you were trying to get through. Some dog owners are so obnoxious.", "NTA.  Agree with your statement that they shouldn't have let the dog block the aisle.", "Bruh idc what anyone here says. That dog should not have been there. Name and shame and leave a shitty review. Who tf says \u201cdon\u2019t step over my dog\u201d the entitlement of these dog owners", "The is definitely the right thing to do but I also think the owner would\u2019ve been an ass anyway.

But the OP should NEVER have been put in the position to have to step over the dog. The dog SHOULD NOT be in the isle.\n\nThe AH here is the dog owner.", "Why? If it's a dog-friendly bar, and your dog is good around people, I don't think it's irresponsible to bring your dog to a bar (not defending the owner in OP's specific scenario)", "There are many \"shouldn't\"s that irresponsible dog owners do. So IMO it's better to behave like that is a possibility instead of waiting until I get bit to tell an owner they \"shouldn't have been there.\"\n\nRealist vs blind optimist.", "I mean, you're only going to read about the bad owners here.  People aren't going to post boring stories about people being responsible and nothing going wrong", "Absolutely", "Smaller dogs are cranky and a p.i.t.a but the pbigger problem are apathetic larger dog owners.
