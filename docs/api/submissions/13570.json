It's like having children in that regard: if you can't have them not be an annoyance to others, you shouldn't bring them to restaurants, pubs etc. \nYour buddy however is right in the respect that stepping over an unknown dog is not the safest approach. Dogs tend to hate it and you don't know if it has behavioural issues and will bite,  or not.", "NTA\n\nWhat an idiot, it's a aisle/path not a dog bed.

For your future safety I wouldn't step over dogs though.", "NTA why do people assume their convenience and comfort is the only thing that matters. You had to use the restroom. Not your problem.", "NTA, the restaurant manager is the AH. Forget about running to the restroom, what about running to the fire exits?", "Not the AH\u2026. Most poochie are friendly, wouldn\u2019t have thought about it twice", "NTA but you shouldn\u2019t step over a dog (for your own safety), and yeah the owner\u2019s responsibility is to insure that dog does not hinder safety in a public space. Definitely shouldn\u2019t be lying in the middle of the aisle. The restaurant staff should have gone to the owner and advised him about it.", "Lol, NTA. The guy was creating a trip hazard with his dog. I'm pretty sure that blocking aisles is also a fire hazard issue.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI hate dog-friendly places because of crap like this.", "NTA. Dogs go under the table. End of story.", "NTA. And I love dogs and spaces that allow dogs, but if you're going to bring your dog in public, you need to keep it out of the way.", "NTA\n\nKeep your dogs, kids, bags...whatever...out of the isle!!", "NTA he\u2019s acting if you stepped on the dog. He should have the dog in a more secure area, what if someone intoxicated wearing heels steps on the poor dog.", "NTA, the dog just bark xD u didn\u2019t try to hurt it", "NTA - I don't let my dog lay down in the middle when she goes somewhere with me, that's just rude.

It is dangerous stepping over the dog, and you could have asked the owner to move the dog.

Any animal that eats garbage from outside receptacles, walks on outside roads/paths or sniffs other dogs bums, will carry harmful bacteria.\n\nNTA, but the easiest way to deal with this would have been to tell people at the table that you needed to get by and to please make access available to you.", "Nta", "NTA - but it's a great way to get bitten or tripped. My dogs would never bite me but they like to suddenly stand up if I step over them. I don't make that mistake anymore.", "NTA\n\nHas someone who frequents the local brewery with three dogs, the owner is an asshole. The dog should have been out of the way", "NTA. The owner sounds like a jerk and they should know better then to park the dog in the middle of the aisle.", "I initially misunderstood and thought it was the owners brewery and dog, in which case tough luck. Just a patron? He should move the dog to not inconvenience other patrons.", "NTA... You did the right thing by respecting someone serving a large party.  Dog owners need to either leave the animal at home. Or keep it out of the way.", "Thank you!!  I would have said something like \"hi, sorry, excuse me, I need to get through.\"  Most dog owners will have their dogs move.", "Yeah people bring all sorts of poorly trained dogs out in public.", ">Plus who cares if you step over a dog?\n\nYou shouldn't, though, especially one you don't know- in case it's response to a stranger looming over it is to bite", "> Plus who cares if you step over a dog?\n\nThe dog does.

I guess the dog could have bitten or tripped OP?", "So then he was endangering people by letting his dog into a brewery, how does that make Op the Ah?", "You mean the negligent decision to let the dog lay all the way across the aisle by the owner? Not everyone is aware dogs might bite when stepped over. As shown by OP..", "We were on the patio", "There is a risk that the dog bites you but if the dog is aggressive, all the more reason that it shouldn't be laying in an aisle in the middle of a restaurant (or if its that aggressive it probably shouldn't be in the restaurant at all).", "Then the dog needs to be muzzled when out in public or owner needs to leave it at home.", "All the more reason it shouldn't be laying in the aisle, or if it bites people, it probably shouldn't be in a restaurant at all", "Tripping would be more likely. Ideally the dog shouldn't be where it is a tripping hazard to start with, but there's not always a choice. If the establishment is truly dog friendly there should be space. But dogs will often move at the last second when you try to step over them which could result in injury to human and dog.\n\nTo me the dog is no different than someone sitting with their chair sticking out further ir a big purse ganging off the back. If there's an obstruction, you ask the other party to correct vs just barreling through.", "I worry less about biting than the dog suddenly deciding to get out of the way(a very common response, esp if the dog doesn't know the person) and tripping OP in the process.", "It shouldn't be in the way for lots of reasons, my comment is just a PSA- dog bites are extremely common", "While you are correct, that's beside the point I was making. It's unfortunately not safe to assume every dog you meet is friendly and owned by someone responsible. Dog bites are extremely common.", "Oh, agreed completely.", "Tripping is probably the biggest potential hazard, also possibly biting, but all of these are just reasons why the dog's owner shouldn't let it lay in the aisle.", "Yeah, I'd say tripping is probably more likely/common than biting (depending on the dog)... which is why a dog shouldn't be lying in the walkway.", "True and there's a lot of dumb/irresponsible dog owners out there... and for some reason they tend to gravitate towards pitbulls just to add to the stupidity.", "I\u2019m aware of how common dog bites are. I didn\u2019t miss the point. There\u2019s no reason to redirect blame from the owner of a defensive or aggressive dog to the person who is bit. I say this as an owner of a dog who was more likely to bite a stranger for walking/reaching over or petting him.", "Yeah. The vote on the top comment of this thread should be ESH (everyone sucks here) rather than Y T A.", "I'm not redirecting blame. The blame would lie with the irresponsible dog owner. My comment is a PSA for people to be smart around dogs because lots of dogs are like yours and plenty of owners are dipshits. So yeah, you did miss the point."]}
