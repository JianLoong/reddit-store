I\u2019d rather have my grandparents back, but at least I\u2019m set up with a good place to live out of college and don\u2019t have to worry about housing like a lot of my friends. I\u2019ve been seeing my boyfriend   Adam (24M) for a year and a half and we\u2019ve been planning to move in together this summer.  He would be moving to my place.  Right now he lives in an apartment with 3 roommates.\n\nAdam has an older brother that is kind of a POS. He and his girlfriend are addicts and have been involved in shady stuff in the past so Adam only talks to them at holidays usually.  They have a son (5M) that Adam sends birthday cards and gifts to but hasn\u2019t spent a whole lot of time around because of the family drama. A couple of weeks ago, the worst happened and the girlfriend died and Adam\u2019s brother is going to be in jail probably for a very long time. Adam\u2019s mom is disabled and not in good enough health to keep up with a 5 year old full time. Girlfriend\u2019s family apparently disowned her and want nothing to do with it. That leaves Adam as a guardian for the kid or foster care.\n\nI am not a kid person. I don\u2019t dislike kids, but I had my own messed up childhood and I would not be a good parent or be able to deal with the noise and chaos of a small kid easily. Adam knows this as we\u2019ve had the \u201cwhat if there\u2019s an oops\u201d and future planning conversations. So, I was surprised when Adam asked about moving plans up for us to live together so that he would have space to take in his nephew.  I said I wasn\u2019t ok with him bringing his nephew and that since the situation had changed the plan would have to be put off until something was figured out. He said there\u2019s no room for his nephew at his current place and rent is sky high so he wouldn\u2019t be able to afford a new place on his own. My place has plenty of room and would be perfect, and this is literally the difference between his nephew staying with family and going god knows where.  We argued and his mom has been calling me to beg me to let them stay with me for awhile until they can make other arrangements. I have a feeling that a little while would turn into permanently once the kid got comfortable.\n\nMutual friends have been telling me I\u2019d be an asshole for not helping Adam at least temporarily because I\u2019m lucky to have the space, but I really don\u2019t want my space invaded like that and have to deal with kicking them out eventually if nothing else comes up.", "created_utc": 1677563206, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11dy9bj/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_boyfriend_move_in_to/", "score": 423, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You decide them, and the extent of them. I am however reminded of an AITA years ago; a woman who married first in the group built boundaries between herself and her husband based upon her friends advice. No compromise was brooked, no flexibility offered, but a myriad of small but firm decisions that eventually led to divorce. Her AITA was centred around the fact that those friends, so keen to back her in building and defending those boundaries before, had since married and done nothing similar. They had sacrificed her to learn the need for compromise.\n\nFrom my experience, relationships are about bending and flexing to the situation. Sometimes, you\u2019ll be the one taking, pulling on the arm  that\u2019s being offered to stop you sinking under choppy waves. Other times you\u2019ll be giving, straining against the weight and heaving your partner back to shore. Might be days where, in 3 foot of surf, you\u2019re convinced you\u2019re drowning until your partner comes and hauls you to your feet, and you can stand tall against the water. Other times you\u2019re both sat on the edge of the dock watching it lap beneath you and eating ice cream. I\u2019ve been lucky to do a lot of that sitting in my relationship, but there wouldn\u2019t have been a chance to if I hadn\u2019t jumped in a few times, and visa versa.\n\nAll of that is to say, allowing your boundaries to become so inflexible that they prevent a currently strong relationship seems self destructive. You\u2019ve envisioned a future with your boyfriend that includes marriage. You were planning on moving him into your home. He was (and sounds like *is*) willing to display flexibility and compromise to accept a level of financial vulnerability to make that future happen. From your OP you clearly love and support one another, and there are no other red or amber flags waving above his head you seem wary of. \n\nThis is a scenario where, through no fault or malice on your boyfriends part, he\u2019s in the water. That his world has exploded, and he\u2019s lost his SIL, and in a weird way also lost his brother too, is enough of a mindfuck for anybody. Has he had time to grieve even? That he also faces becoming responsible for his nephew, and that he\u2019s trying to do the right thing by him shows great character. \n\nIf your decision is that you cannot accept a partner unless they\u2019re bone dry, then absolutely you can walk away, though I\u2019d temper some of the more immediate and authoritative advice about breaking the relationship with this concern. \n\nIf this situation, as dire and drastic as it is, isn\u2019t enough to bend or flex your boundaries then would anything? If removing those obstacles from your life that you know will impact or cause you stress is a noble goal (and I think it is), then is never facing any pressure situation again healthy? \n\nI can\u2019t agree. \n\nTo stretch the bad beach metaphor further, you can wait until you find another partner to build that life you wanted; but he might also face obstacles that end up with him knee deep in the surf. What happens then? It seems unlikely that you\u2019ll find someone with no baggage of any kind, will perfect always be the enemy of good? \n\nTo be clear, it\u2019s a fucking shit show and his mother should not be contacting you, even if from a place of genuine concern, to petition on his behalf. \n\nHope you can make a decision that you\u2019re comfortable with OP, my condolences either way.", "Assuming you\u2019re in the US, there are two separate disability programs administered by Social Security - SSDI and SSI.

Hold firm, as much as you may feel guilt or they may try to manipulate you into feeling it. You know that you don't want a child in the home and you haven't been with bf that long. And to be fair, it's SO much more than him taking care of nephew in the home. You will absolutely have to take on a parental role. Look ahead to him asking you to watch the kid for various reasons, you needing to set rules and he won't let you dole out punishments, etc. It's so much more than just staying with you.
