{"id": 11112, "submission_id": "11dy9bj", "title": "AITA for refusing to let my boyfriend move in to my house with his nephew even temporarily?", "selftext": "I (23F) inherited my grandparents house and land last year.  I\u2019d rather have my grandparents back, but at least I\u2019m set up with a good place to live out of college and don\u2019t have to worry about housing like a lot of my friends. I\u2019ve been seeing my boyfriend   Adam (24M) for a year and a half and we\u2019ve been planning to move in together this summer.  He would be moving to my place.  Right now he lives in an apartment with 3 roommates.\n\nAdam has an older brother that is kind of a POS. He and his girlfriend are addicts and have been involved in shady stuff in the past so Adam only talks to them at holidays usually.  They have a son (5M) that Adam sends birthday cards and gifts to but hasn\u2019t spent a whole lot of time around because of the family drama. A couple of weeks ago, the worst happened and the girlfriend died and Adam\u2019s brother is going to be in jail probably for a very long time. Adam\u2019s mom is disabled and not in good enough health to keep up with a 5 year old full time. Girlfriend\u2019s family apparently disowned her and want nothing to do with it. That leaves Adam as a guardian for the kid or foster care.\n\nI am not a kid person. I don\u2019t dislike kids, but I had my own messed up childhood and I would not be a good parent or be able to deal with the noise and chaos of a small kid easily. Adam knows this as we\u2019ve had the \u201cwhat if there\u2019s an oops\u201d and future planning conversations. So, I was surprised when Adam asked about moving plans up for us to live together so that he would have space to take in his nephew.  I said I wasn\u2019t ok with him bringing his nephew and that since the situation had changed the plan would have to be put off until something was figured out. He said there\u2019s no room for his nephew at his current place and rent is sky high so he wouldn\u2019t be able to afford a new place on his own. My place has plenty of room and would be perfect, and this is literally the difference between his nephew staying with family and going god knows where.  We argued and his mom has been calling me to beg me to let them stay with me for awhile until they can make other arrangements. I have a feeling that a little while would turn into permanently once the kid got comfortable.\n\nMutual friends have been telling me I\u2019d be an asshole for not helping Adam at least temporarily because I\u2019m lucky to have the space, but I really don\u2019t want my space invaded like that and have to deal with kicking them out eventually if nothing else comes up.", "created_utc": 1677563206, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11dy9bj/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_boyfriend_move_in_to/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Taking in a child is not temporary. It's looking like your boyfriend is expected to adopt this child.\n\nYou know your boundaries, and they are actually completely reasonable. There are a lot of kids in terrible situations, and you are not expected to take them into your home and become a parent to them (which you would be doing here; they're lying to you and/or themselves if they say otherwise).\n\nBe sympathetic to your boyfriend, maybe help him find subsidized housing or resources for him (the state may support family-member fostering). But don't let him move in with you. You would be miserable.", "It seems like your boyfriend is maybe going to have to decide whether he wants to take care of his nephew or be with you. I told my husband that I would be the parent to 4 kids if anything happened to my sis or BIL when we first got together. I don't want kids and neither does he but he married me knowing there was a chance we could end up guardians. At the end of the day it's your life, your house,  and your peace. You get to decide what you're comfortable with. NTA also squatters rights are a pain in the butt.", "NTA. But this is the end of your relationship", "Definitely NTA.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for his situation, it\u2019s a very tough spot for Adam to be in, essentially being forced to raise his nephew, but geez, his poor nephew.  Please tell Adam that he should check with Social Security if the boy\u2019s mother was working to see if he\u2019s eligible for survivor benefits. That could help with rent if Adam gets a place for the two of them.  Would Adam\u2019s mother have room for them to move in with her ?\n\nIf you were to let him move in with his nephew \u201ctemporarily \u201c how would he ever have the money to get his own place ?  He wouldn\u2019t.  And you\u2019d be miserable.", "NTA. Charity and generosity are important social characteristics we all should aspire to.  But the choice is so personal that comparisons with a standard of behavior that others claim should be followed seems inappropriate.   It's easy for someone to say this is what should be done when they are not faced with assuming an unwanted obligation.   All of the concerns you mentioned are possible outcomes.   They might even be unavoidable.  What you decide is your business alone and not subject to the judgement of others.  Others will assume that they know what should be done and will judge you anyway.   Don't do anything that you don't want to do.   Charity and generosity given because of a sense of obligation isn't either.  Sorry for BF and his nephew.  Best wishes.", "NTA. He will never move out.", "Nta. Trust your gut, OP.", "NTA. Boundaries are boundaries. \n\nYour relationship has ended. You aren\u2019t going to budge on having kids and your boyfriend will want to take care of his nephew. You both want fundamentally different things. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault in that.\n\nHe become TA when he decided to air this out and bring everyone else into it to pressure you into opening your house for him and his nephew.

He does not have the spavce and can't afford anything else .. this will not change when he has MORE costs because he has to pay for the kid, too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**You have not signed up for this. So refuse.** Or you will be the kid's main caretaker in a few months. He is already pushing you to bekome the kid's mom, babysitter and at MINIMUM 50% caretaker.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**At that point, you will likely have to decide between doing it or ending the relationship. So break up.**", "NTA\n\nIf you're child free and Adam wants to take in his nephew, he needs to figure that out without you.  Adam's plan hinges on you giving them cheap/free housing, and that isn't okay. \n\nAlso, studies have consistently shown that women in heterosexual relationships end up doing a larger share of the housework.  So, if Adam and the kid moved in, Adam would most likely expect you to do most of the cooking, cleaning, laundry, and \"help\" with childcare and errands and such.  It would never just be Adam and his nephew quietly sharing your space and no impact on your life.\n\nIf you consider letting anyone move into your home, you need a written lease, they should pay rent, and they need to pay a damage deposit and first month's rent.  Use the lease to lay out boundaries like no smoking, no drugs, no overnight visitors for longer than three days, and no pets (or limitations on pets).  Don't let others take advantage of you.", "NTA Mutual friends are free to pay his rent at another apartment. Or offer their own houses. It really is that simple.", "Please don\u2019t give in..

In this case you will be stuck as they wont be able to move.\n\nLast point is that in many western nations after a period of time, as short as 18mths some places you are deemed to be in a defacto relationship...effectively married.  Meaning your home might become a joint asset.\n\nYour bf is now effectively a single dad for the next 20yrs, if you dont want to be a mum to this kid you need to break up NOW.", "INFO - why cannot the mother take them both in?", "NTA You have to be comfortable in your own home, it's one thing to start living with someone for the first time and quite another to take in someone else's child.  \n\nDon't let anyone tell you that you wouldn't have to do anything for your BF's nephew if they moved in, of course he's going to ask you to do things.  Just little things at first and then more and more responsibility will be asked of you.  That's just how things like this happen - its life.\n\nAnd you're right, the nephew doesn't know you at all, truthfully Adam doesn't really know his nephew so all of this is going to be a big upheaval for the nephew, and for Adam.  Is that something that you want to be in the middle of?\n\nAdam already knows your thoughts on kids at this stage of your life and it isn't really fair of him to put this on you or for his mum to guilt you into it.  It is as you've admitted a step up or walk away point of your relationship with Adam.  And your friends aren't the ones that are takiing them both in to their households.  If they're so keen, ask them if they want to live with Adam and his nephew.", "Oh god, that poor kid. His mom dies, dad goes to jail, and now he\u2019s likely going to end up in foster care :(:(", "NTA stay the hell away from them and even your boyfriend.... If he was prepared to engage with that then bin him off too.", "NAH. You made plans together and circumstances have changed in a tragic way. He's not an asshole for wanting to try and make it work and include his nephew in the plans, you're not an asshole for saying no.\n\nI do find it interesting that you were planning a future with someone you don't ultimately trust to keep his word now he's said it would be temporary until they make other arrangements. Still not in an asshole way but if he moved in solo and you broke up down the line, would you expect him to also refuse to move out again? That's... Strange to me.", "YTA. Break up with him now, so you're no longer diverting his attention from caring for this child.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is a really tough situation for everyone involved and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re all having to go through this. I can understand your boyfriend wanting to be there for his nephew but raising a five year old is A LOT of work and a HUGE commitment. If it\u2019s something he is willing and capable of doing, that\u2019s amazing!

Having a child is a big responsibility. It's a responsibility you've decided you don't want. Your bf has decided he does want that responsibility, and is trying to make it your responsibility by proxy.\n\nThe truth is you were planning to move in together and then *he* changed the plan by taking in his nephew. He then *allowed his mother to harass you* over your decision to [checks notes] not take in her grandchild that is the child of *her child the drug addict*. You're getting a glimpse of what will happen if you let them move in and try to stand your ground.\n\nSometimes things happen around us that we have no control over, you just have to react as best you can. Your boyfriend has committed to raising a child. You probably can't change his mind (and probably shouldn't) but you don't have to commit to parenting with him. That poor boy needs stability right now and moving in with you is not going to provide it. You owe your boyfriend and that child nothing more than the honesty that your relationship is over, you do not owe him what you have because he doesn't have it.", "Gosh.
