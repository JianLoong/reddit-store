We just workshopped this story yesterday and I noticed that the whole story is literally the same as a really famous movie from a country in South East Asia. The writter just changed the characters name, everything else is basically the same. It was a, literally, a movie that was shortened and made into a short story.\n\nI usually would turn a blind eye for a small plagiarism in general. But I'm so pissed, because I know everyone in the class tried hard to write their own story, including me. \n\nYes mine is not perfect, and yes my story do need some fixing here and there. But I don't want to have the same grade or even worse, lower grade than someone who just copied a whole movie. Nor I want my classmate who have original idea to have the same grade as a fucking plagiarised story.\n\nI think I'm the only one who knew this movie, since I'm an international student who's from South East Asia too. \n\nBut, on the other hand. I feel bad if they gonna get bigger repercussion that what I expected, which usually is a 0 for the assignment grade. \n\nWill I be the asshole if I report this person to my prof?\n\nUpdate to add some info:\nThe story is literally the same with the movie, except for the characters name. Not only plot wise, but the settings and every important scene from start to finish are in the story.\n\nI assume the writer know the movie since they are from the country the movie was released, and as I metion it's a super famous movie. That's why even me, who's from a different country watched it.\n\nUpdate:\nI did not expect this post to get so much attention. Thank you all for your insight, I really appreciate it. I do need more time to think about this though.\n\nMy original post sounded harsh because I was really pissed at that time and I apologize about that. As I mentioned above, I do turn a blind eye if I saw few dialogue or paragraph, or even a scene that I saw or read somewhere. I understand that a story will never be 'original', but one that is really similar to a movie is a whole new level for me. That's why the thought of reporting it to my prof came out.\n\nWe already submitted our story so no, I could not talk to the writter about this. This story is worth 25% of our grade, and I do not know if my prof grade stuff with a curve or not, nor does the story will affect my grade or not.\n\nI do feel bad for the writter since I do not know the repercussion they will get if the professor deems it is a plagiarism. But I also feel bad for my classmates and for myself since I think that this is unfair that we spent weeks finding ideas and writting our stories. That said I still need more time to think and decide what to do next.\n\nP.S.

Is it one of those movies that has a formulaic plot - think Romeo and Juliet or Jane Eyre - that often gets reused in movies? Did the student take the plot alone or did they also use actual lines of dialog, same exact setting, etc.?\n\nI had a student who retold the story of Much Ado About Nothing but set in a US middle school. It was brilliantly done. She didn\u2019t say that was what she was doing or credit Shakespeare, and wasn\u2019t even consciously using the plot. When I mentioned how cool it was that she had retold the story the way she did, she was mortified and apologized for what was truly really good work. She hadn\u2019t realized that she was drawing on a story that has been told for centuries, most notably by Shakespeare. It wasn\u2019t plagiarism in my university\u2019s eyes, either. Creative writing allows the writer to retell old stories; think of all the retellings of Pride and Prejudice or books like Wicked that retell other authors\u2019 stories or use their characters. \n\nThat being said, if the story and movie are literally identical in plot, it would not an AH move to ask your prof to talk to the student about it. \n\nI\u2019d avoid being accusatory and maybe start with \u201cProfessor Name, I\u2019ve debated with myself about bringing this to you, but Student Name\u2019s story has precisely the same plot as Movie Title and it just feels wrong to me for someone to present what they wrote as their own work in that situation.

Plagiarism is verbatim copying or closely paraphrasing of copyrighted material or in an academic setting, of published material or another student\u2019s work. Therefore, in this case, the student would be plagiarizing if their story had identical or highly similar dialogue as the movie or closely mirrored a Wikipedia or other published summary of its plot. \n\nMerely having a similar plot with totally different and original dialogue is NOT plagiarism. In talks I give at writers\u2019 conference I\u2019d frequently have writers tell me their ideas had been stole by publishers. While that could indeed happen, 99% of the time, their idea was a very common one, such ss \u201cHow to have a yard sale\u201d or \u201cHow to spice up your sex life,\u201d that has been done a million times before.\n\nSimilarly at my agency, I\u2019d often get submissions of novels that were inspired by current events. After a major earthquake, I got many submissions of novels with plots centered on an earthquake or another type of natural disaster. None were plagiarized, they just drew on the same real life event for inspiration. It may be that the plot of this East Asian movie is not unique: there are very few totally original plot lines in fiction. \n\nFor example, there is an entire genre of fiction called gothic novels that were inspired by Jane Eyre. However, occasionally a writer does come up with something unique. I recently read a novel called \u201cMemoirs of an Imaginary Friend\u201d that struck me as having a truly unique premise. In the novel, the imaginary friend of an autistic child tries to figure how to rescue him when he\u2019s kidnapped. \n\nBut even if a student wrote a story with an imaginary friend as the main character, it still wouldn\u2019t be plagiarism if the words were totally different and the story had different twists and turns than the published book. \n\nNTA: As a student, you\u2019re there to learn and discussing this with your teacher would clarify if the other student has cheated or not. If so, that student deserves to suffer the consequences of their actions. And others have pointed out, some schools have an honor code that requires reporting possible instances of cheating.\n\nEdited to clarify and fix a typo.", "This part. Depending on the assignment,  the teacher will be able to determine whether the student actually receives a zero, or is cautioned, or just loses a few points. It\u2019s possible that this is a teaching moment for the class. It\u2019s also possible (and I assume this is what OP suspects), that the classmate chose a film from another culture so they wouldn\u2019t get caught. Which is pretty awful", "I think your suggestion is the best way to go.", "Absolutely. Bringing it up to the professor more neutrally would be a smart move. It very well could be plagiarism, but yeah taking characters and plots isn\u2019t inherently plagiarism. From what OP says, it might be, but really it\u2019s up to the professor to decide if it was an appropriate use of preexisting material or not. \n\nYour point on using it for discourse about where our stories come from is particularly great. It feels like something most people don\u2019t think much about, that these things just come out of the ether with tenuous links at best to other works, but everything we create is pretty indebted to a whole mix of stuff that\u2019s already out there.\n\n In my view, originality is sort of a bad goal. Obviously don\u2019t just plagiarize straight passages or anything and be careful not to just create a carbon copy of a story worded differently, but it seems more important to try and create something interesting rather than wholly unique, since in the end nothing is going to be completely new. Finding your own voice in writing seems to be a more productive way to pursue creating one\u2019s own authentic work. Certainly not a simple or easy thing, but I feel like that\u2019s overlooked by a lot people in favor of the Sisyphean task of trying to write a plot that hasn\u2019t been written before.", "Well, it depends on what the instructions are, correct?

The legal question is whether it's a copyright violation, and the answer is no, because it's so old it's public domain. There are also legal rules about transformative works which are irrelevant in this case, but for works that aren't public domain it's a very complicated situation. There's a lot of caselaw on it, but the gist is that you can't copyright an idea but you can copyright a specific 'work of authorship,' and while that may seem vague, a good way to think about it is that after Harry Potter, when a bunch of children's books came out about magic boarding schools with their own unique characters and plots, that was fine, but if someone had tried to publish one about a boy named Harry with a scar who went to Hogwarts, it wouldn't have been alright.\n\nThe ethical question, in my opinion, depends on whether the work is transformative or not. I think it's easier with modern retellings of older works, because by transposing it to a modern setting, it's necessarily transformative, and a good writer would use the opportunity to examine different themes (The Lizzy Bennett Diaries, for example, both make a feminist point about the marriage obsession and question Lizzy's reliability as a narrator as to her own mother's actions), but there are a lot of ways to do 'transformative' versions of stories we already know. \n\nAnyways, to Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, I think that for starters, it's ethical in that it's very clear that it's a derivative of Pride and Prejudice (I think the author gives Austen a co-writing credit?), but it's also adding a lot more substance to it, changing character motivations and creating new plot points, so basically, in my view, the author still did the work of coming up with significant new material for this story.

Kimba is a vegetarian lion whose father was shot by hunter and so he hangs out with and occasionally wears his father's dead pelt and tries to get other animals to be vegetarian and peaceful over the course of a long TV show + movies - yeah, identical to the Lion King's plot, Disney should be ashamed. The best argument anyone still has for the Lion King being particularly similar is the name (where Simba means LION, it's like complaining about plagiarism because one person named their dog Dug and the next one named their dog Dog) and apparently that they both use animated animals from Africa. The side by side shots you see where the visuals look very similar and are overwhelmingly taken from Kimba's Jungle Emperor Leo, a movie that you may note came out in 1997, so if anything the ripping off went the other way around, unless people think only one person is allowed to make an animated story about a lion ever.\n\n(ninja edit - wrong link)", "Thank you for that.

Academia is so much more strict about this stuff than the professional world.", "And as a person who writes both original content and fanfiction, there's a big difference between writing a derivative work for pleasure/to post in fan spaces and submitting a copied story to a class! I really enjoy writing fanfic, but it uses a different skillset than original fiction writing does, because often, your setting or characters are already developed for you, and you don't have to introduce the readers to a world where everything is brand new. And hell, even in fanfiction, most of the time you're coming up with your own plot, which is different than what the student in OP's class is doing, since she's just taking a plot that already exists, with a movie that's already charted out the major beats, and rewriting it into narrative form.\n\nIn a creative writing class, unless you're specifically writing derivative fiction (which some classes do assign), a lot of what you're expected to do, and what you're being evaluated on, is how well you can develop original characters, come up with a plot, figure out the pacing for it, etc. and those aren't skills that this student is learning or will accurately be graded on.", "Hm, I guess it depends on how OP means that. I have realized that sometimes I will find a turn of phrase or a couplet of dialogue in a book or a movie that I really love, and then years later incorporate it into a piece of writing I'm working on and not make the connection, because so much time has passed. I've caught myself doing it once or twice because I happened to be editing a piece with the phrase and reread the book or rewatched the movie, but I think that there's definitely room to say that one or two lines that are the same might actually be an honest mistake. But a whole paragraph, word for word, is definitely stretching that. You're right that OP's final edit does seem to show that they don't have the most accurate view of what plagiarism is.\n\nBut even if it's not plagiarism as in 'copying the exact language,' if the scenes are the same and the characters are the same, it's probably under the umbrella of academic dishonesty, especially since OP said this is 25% of their grade. A creative writing project worth that much probably won't just be graded on writing style, the plot progression, character developments, etc., will be taking into account too.\n\nI personally think OP wouldn't be TA to report it; it's up to the professor to decide how to deal with it at that point.", "Probably the goal was to make sure that students did new research and fresh reporting and analysis in their papers to help them learn more about their subject matter rather than just parrot old papers they did for other courses.", "Omg.

Universities like to scare students, but they absolutely do *not* want to go through all the hoops required to actually expel someone for a non-violent offense. In my experience, most cases of plagiarism are quietly swept under the rug, and students are simply asked to redo the assignment.

I had the same teacher for two classes in a row on the same day, and in all of his classes he would have a \"beginning of the day\" question that everybody had to answer. Most of the time he gave a different question to the different classes, because of the varying questions being more relevant to what we were learning in the particular class. But sometimes both classes got the same question, and one egregious time the same question was something along the lines of \"write ten paragraphs about what you did over Winter break.\" There was no way I was writing the same thing twice in that situation, so, for the second class, I simply just wrote \"see previous class answer.\" He never questioned me about it, and I got full points in both classes", "If you're a Trekkie there is an episode from the original series in the 60s I think called \"Gunfight at the OK Corral\" or something similar.
