Report it.", "As someone who's worked as a college teacher, please report this. No matter how hard we try, people who grade student work in creative subjects especially do end up unconsciously comparing. So if one student does something really brilliant then another who is just averagely good, will not look so impressive. Students who plagiriase are actually skewering things for the whole class, and also cheating and wasting the time of the professor. I know that's not your main concern but speaking from experience its horrible to realise someone you thought was a great student has just been lying and manipulating you", "Nta report it .

But there are gonna be heavy consequences and not every class is gonna be important for someones future. Maybe they had a family emergency and couldn't work on the project, or just really need this credit for something completely unrelated and aren't good at writing. This could cost them their degree and their future, they might even get kicked out. Ask yourself if it's truly worth it.", "ESH - it's a tough situation. You want to succeed because your hard work and you don't want to be invalidated by a person getting the same reward for little effort, but you also don't want to be responsible for hurting them. \n\nwhat you have to ask yourself is:\n\n* Does it hurt me if they are not reported? I put in the effort, and no matter what their grade is it will not affect my grade. I worked and learned so i will benefit from the exercise while they didn't.\n* Are they actually plagarizing or is it just inspiration/coincidence? Plagarizing is pretty much supposed to be verbatim. I think you have to learn what their knowledge/intent/awareness is on the topic before making a firm conclusion if they're plagarizing or not.\n\n\\----\n\nas an alternative, you can talk to the teacher about using the said persons story as a way to learn more about plagarism, influences/inspiration, coincidences, and how they may overlap & differ. you can talk to the teach first, without telling them who actually you're talkinga bout b/c you don't want them to get in trouble.", "dont be a narc", "would be the ah- mind your business.  sometimes the right answers to do nothing.  instead of worrying about what other people are doing worry about yourself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
