Is it one of those movies that has a formulaic plot - think Romeo and Juliet or Jane Eyre - that often gets reused in movies? Did the student take the plot alone or did they also use actual lines of dialog, same exact setting, etc.?\n\nI had a student who retold the story of Much Ado About Nothing but set in a US middle school. It was brilliantly done. She didn\u2019t say that was what she was doing or credit Shakespeare, and wasn\u2019t even consciously using the plot. When I mentioned how cool it was that she had retold the story the way she did, she was mortified and apologized for what was truly really good work. She hadn\u2019t realized that she was drawing on a story that has been told for centuries, most notably by Shakespeare. It wasn\u2019t plagiarism in my university\u2019s eyes, either. Creative writing allows the writer to retell old stories; think of all the retellings of Pride and Prejudice or books like Wicked that retell other authors\u2019 stories or use their characters. \n\nThat being said, if the story and movie are literally identical in plot, it would not an AH move to ask your prof to talk to the student about it. \n\nI\u2019d avoid being accusatory and maybe start with \u201cProfessor Name, I\u2019ve debated with myself about bringing this to you, but Student Name\u2019s story has precisely the same plot as Movie Title and it just feels wrong to me for someone to present what they wrote as their own work in that situation.

Plagiarism is verbatim copying or closely paraphrasing of copyrighted material or in an academic setting, of another student\u2019s work. Therefore, in this case, the student would be plagiarizing if their story had identical or highly similar dialogue as the movie or closely mirrored a Wikipedia or other published summary of its plot. \n\nMerely having a similar plot with totally different and original dialogue is NOT plagiarism. In talks I give at writers\u2019 conference I\u2019d frequently have writers tell me their ideas had been stole by publishers. While that could indeed happen, 99% of the time, their idea was a very common one, such ss \u201cHow to have a yard sale\u201d or \u201cHow to spice up your sex life,\u201d that has been done a million times before.\n\nSimilarly at my agency, I\u2019d often get submissions of novels that were inspired by current events. After a major earthquake, I got many submissions of novels with plots centered on an earthquake or another type of natural disaster. None were plagiarized, they just drew on the same real life event for inspiration. It may be that the plot of this East Asian movie is not unique: there are very few totally original plot lines in fiction. \n\nFor example, there is an entire genre of fiction called gothic novels that were inspired by Jane Eyre. However, occasionally a writer does come up with something unique. I recently read a novel callec \u201cMemoirs of an Imaginary Friend\u201d that struck me as having a truly unique premise. \n\nBut even if a student wrote a story with an imaginary friend as the main character, it still wouldn\u2019t be plagiarism if the words were totally different and the story had different twists and turns than the published book. \n\nNTA: As a student, you\u2019re there to learn and discussing this with your teacher would clarify if the other student has cheated or not. If so, that student deserves to suffer the consequences of their actions. And others have pointed out, some schools have an honor code that requires reporting possible instances of cheating.", "This part. Depending on the assignment,  the teacher will be able to determine whether the student actually receives a zero, or is cautioned, or just loses a few points. It\u2019s possible that this is a teaching moment for the class. It\u2019s also possible (and I assume this is what OP suspects), that the classmate chose a film from another culture so they wouldn\u2019t get caught. Which is pretty awful", "I think your suggestion is the best way to go.", "Absolutely. Bringing it up to the professor more neutrally would be a smart move. It very well could be plagiarism, but yeah taking characters and plots isn\u2019t inherently plagiarism. From what OP says, it might be, but really it\u2019s up to the professor to decide if it was an appropriate use of preexisting material or not. \n\nYour point on using it for discourse about where our stories come from is particularly great. It feels like something most people don\u2019t think much about, that these things just come out of the ether with tenuous links at best to other works, but everything we create is pretty indebted to a whole mix of stuff that\u2019s already out there.\n\n In my view, originality is sort of a bad goal. Obviously don\u2019t just plagiarize straight passages or anything and be careful not to just create a carbon copy of a story worded differently, but it seems more important to try and create something interesting rather than wholly unique, since in the end nothing is going to be completely new. Finding your own voice in writing seems to be a more productive way to pursue creating one\u2019s own authentic work. Certainly not a simple or easy thing, but I feel like that\u2019s overlooked by a lot people in favor of the Sisyphean task of trying to write a plot that hasn\u2019t been written before.", "Well, it depends on what the instructions are, correct?

It\u2019s up to the professor to decide how to act on the information.", "You're absolutely 100% wrong. Rewording, paraphrasing, and summarizing original works without citing and acknowledging said works is plagiarism. It's in the definition. It's explained that way by every academic institution, it's explained that way in the fucking dictionary. Every creative writing course I've ever taken has gone out of their way to touch on this.
