He's in a high emotion situation and you have a lot of justified baggage and that ran into each other in a suboptimal way. If I had to guess, you saying that might actually have been GOOD for him to hear- if they're having marriage problems I have a hard time buying that her mistreating you isn't a factor. Not saying it's the only factor, but your dad might be sick of seeing someone who's supposed to care about him mistreat someone important to him. You being honest might've helped him sort out in his head that he's not seeing things, things between the two of you really are THAT bad, and you ARE hurt. Give it a day or two and check back in. Then you can open with something along the lines of \"I'm sorry if I was too blunt, I don't want to hurt you because stepmom and I have problems. I just only care about her because she made you happy, and if that's not the case anymore then I care more about how YOU are doing than about someone who's made no secret about disliking me. How are you doing?\"", "NTA\n\nWhy should you care? You tried, she didn't want to have any connection with you. Forcing a relationship with someone is pointless.", "Everyone doesn't deserve forgiveness, you forgave who you want when you want if you want to.  NTA"]}
