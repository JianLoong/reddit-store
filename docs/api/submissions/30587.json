My mom likes to barge in at random times and so when she couldn't open the door she asked my step dad and got my bedroom door removed.

You don\u2019t give someone something they are allergic to purposefully it\u2019s illegal. You have autism and ADHD you aren\u2019t stupid and obviously you know that you would be doing something wrong considering you are asking.  You live under someone else\u2019s roof. At a later date I suggest you speak to your mother about boundaries and ask her to stop barging in your room. Your mom is an a hole for that. You don\u2019t bar your door in a home you don\u2019t own, you also need to respect the rules of the house in which you live in and if you need to dress modestly then do it! You clearly are not even remotely close to being mature enough to live on your own. This post is evidence of that.  \u201c uh yeah my mom is allergic to something so I wanna use that to repel her\u201d what are you 12???? But what you aren\u2019t thinking of is the betrayal your mother will feel when you essentially poison her or do something like this on purpose to her and how bad are her reactions? Have you thought about that? Did you know that constant exposure to an allergen can cause the allergy to get worse?  You are 18 start researching ways to approach and communicate boundaries. Learn to use your words effectively and have a dialogue because that\u2019s what adults do.", "I'm saying ESH for the same reason as a lot of people here, but I'd call OP a justified AH. She already tried talking to her mother and it didn't do anything. At this point the mom is like a pest to keep away with mom repellent.", "Yes, YTA. Triggering people's allergies is a potentially serious thing. People can die from that.\n\nThere are other ways to deal with your mom being annoying and not respecting your boundaries.\n\nYes, your mom also sounds bonkers, but she's not endangering your health, at least. You're the one doing that.", "YTA - triggering someone\u2019s allergy is psychopathic. You are an adult - if you don\u2019t like where you live then move.", "NTA - good solution to her barging in without knocking!", "ESH. It\u2019s not okay to trigger people\u2019s allergies, ever.
