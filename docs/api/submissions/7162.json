You should have disciplined your daughter for her actions, and you should have cooked something else for you SIL and nephew \n\nYour daughter sounds like she's got a lot of resentment.

But she was told not to use dairy in the meal and did it anyways. You should have been an adult and addressed the situation, instead of ignoring it and just starting to eat. If you can\u2019t be civil, don\u2019t go to group events.", "Yes, YTA.  Your daughter cooked stuff that people who had been invited to dinner couldn\u2019t eat\u2014after specifically being told not to cook it with dairy.  I understand there is probably hatred on both sides, but your daughter is in the wrong on this one, and so are you for not disciplining her.  \n\nShe specifically offered to cook everything knowing they would be there and being told not to cook everything with dairy.  She could easily have not participated in cooking.", "YTA. Why invite them over then treat them like crap? \n\nYour cheating brother had options too. He could have divorced SIL and taken custody of his daughter. Or just not cheated, perhaps? Refusing the be responsible for an affair baby isn't that strange a position.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nYour daughter was told not to cook something. She cooked it anyway, apparently deliberately to be spiteful to your brother and SIL as \"she truly dislikes them\". You did nothing to discipline your daughter in the moment and there's no mention of disciplining your daughter afterwards either. It is not good parenting to encourage your daughter to be spiteful to people like this. Her offer of help was a lie; she didn't want to help, she wanted to stick one to her bio dad because she doesn't like him and his wife.  You owe them an apology; You chose to accept an invitation to this dinner, you chose to let your daughter cook the meal. If their relationship is this poor - why?\n\nYour daughter no doubt needs therapy about having resentment for the situation, and you need to realize it's not okay to be petty and spiteful.", "YTA Come on they are lactose intolerant and by doing this she was purposefully trying to upset them. That has to mean some form of punishment is necessary but you just noped out of parenting.", "YTA It's just rude as hell to intentionally cook food several dinner guests can't eat.

She's clearly still lashing out for petty revenge at her stepmom as a result.", "YTA - it's your role to raise your kid to be responsible, and overall respectful and kind. Putting dairy in every dish so SIL and her cousin can't eat was an a-hole move, and you should have grounded her and make her apologize. Imagine she would have make them sick? Parent your kid.", "YTA for having these people around your daughter. It's clear she is suffering and feeling abandoned. Your brother couldn't keep it in his pants and your SIL wants to disregard an innocent child (which is her right). Don't then flaunt these people in your daughter's face.", "YTA. I get why SIL and your daughter dislike each other, but that doesn't mean your daughter gets to sabotage your mother's dinner like this. You do need to sort your daughter's behaviour out - you're clearly ok with her being a dick to your SIL, which is lazy on your part tbh, but remember she's also been really disrespectful to your mother here.", "How old is your daughter? I assume if she's old enough to cook, she's old enough to know what dairy is, especially considering that you said your daughter dislikes them and it sounds intentional.\n\nGiven that it sounds intentional, YTA and so is your daughter. There's really no excuse for being that malicious. I will give you that your SIL got awfully bent out of shape about your parenting, which isn't her business, but you should've had a talk with your daughter then. It should've been a talk about how two wrongs don't make a right.", "YTA. It\u2019s understandable why SIL didn\u2019t want to raise a child of her ex and affair partner - not her job, and kind of a mess. It\u2019s also understandable that the daughter isn\u2019t SILs biggest fan either. \n\nThe whole situation is unfair to both of them. However, it doesn\u2019t seem like you really tried to help your daughter understand that SIL isn\u2019t her mom, and it\u2019s her actual mom and dad that abandoned her. It also seems like your personal opinion is she should have raised someone else\u2019s affair kid.\n\nI would get daughter being resentful of cooking for people she has a problem with. But nobody made daughter cook here - it was entirely her choice. You do not volunteer to cook for someone you don\u2019t like and then deliberately ignore instructions to punish them.

Yes, the answer is yes.", "YTA", "INFO: What\u2019s your daughters age? Why does she dislike your SIL so much?\n\nEdit: based on your daughter being 16 YTA.

It's not your daughter's fault, the circumstances of her birth. I can also see not wanting to raise your partner's affair child. You see a grown adult treating a child badly. She sees a constant reminder of her husband's infidelity. It's a bad situation overall but this didn't help. Maybe they just shouldn't be around each other from now on?", "INFO how old is your daughter?

Brother is out making babies with people while his wife is pregnant. This whole thing is a mess. Personally, I think it's not great to teach your daughter that it's a good idea to settle problems with passive aggressive digs and a revenge mindset. There are better ways to let someone know you feel they have treated you poorly.\n\n Besides all that, what if SIL had eaten the food and stunk up the whole house on purpose? What then?", "How does your SiL usually treat your daughter?", "NTA- SILim sure has been bullying this kid her whole life.
