My brother has a son Jax (18) who was raised by his maternal grandparents from the age of 5 after his mom passed away. My brother was not part of Jax's life. I was. I have made an effort to be a big part of his life. I see him as much as possible. He has spent the night at my house several times. He's my nephew and I was never going to abandon him the way my brother did.\n\nSIL asked me to give her Jax's contact info when she was pregnant so she could tell him he was going to have a little sister. I told her that Jax did not want her or his dad to have the contact info and he already knew she was pregnant. She asked how and I told her I let him know, because he had always wanted to know if my brother or someone else in my brother's life might try to reach out to him. He's not interested. He's felt that way for years and I respect that. Having a half sibling coming into the world means nothing to him. As far as he's concerned he will always be an only child because he only has one parent, his mom.\n\nSIL decided to track Jax down on social media before her baby shower to invite him. He never replied and he didn't show, which I knew beforehand. SIL was upset about it and vented to me. I mostly ignored her. It was after my niece was born that the incident in question happened. \n\nSIL reached out to Jax again and was blocked and reported for harassment. She was upset and said it wasn't fair Jax was taking it out on her daughter and that she deserves to have her big brother in her life despite my brother's \"mistakes\" in letting him be out of his life. She was getting very blamey toward Jax and I did not want to hear it. I told her if she had wanted her child to have a big brother then she shouldn't have married a deadbeat dad, she shouldn't have married my brother, because they have ZERO right to expect Jax to want anything to do with any of them. SIL said Jax wanted me in his life. I told her I was there from day one and never let my brother's actions take me out of his life. I showed up when HE didn't and I stayed friendly with his grandparents and he saw that. I told her that SHE didn't get to demand anything from him when she knowingly married my brother.\n\nSIL said I was blaming her for no reason and I should be more understanding that as a mom she wants the best for her kid.\n\nAITA for what I said to her?", "created_utc": 1692037206, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15r2ip3/aita_for_telling_my_sil_she_shouldnt_have_married/", "score": 2171, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is probably quite unlikely that he would ever want to have a relationship with his jackass of a father. (He's also very nearly still a kid himself so an adult woman not understanding that you wouldn't let bygones be bygones with your absentee father is pretty dumb)", "How is OP the AH for relaying Jax's decision? The newborn isn't being harmed by Jax continuing his policy of ignoring the existence of his father. Jax and SIL are effectively strangers and Jax doesn't even consider his father to be family. The newborn is not harmed by being an only child for the moment (there's nothing stopping SIL and deadbeat from having another child if siblings are so important).", "Till death do us part... in which case, get your kid outta here!", "That is exactly what I said. She is worried about her kid having a sibling. She gives no thought to Jax. It\u2019s about her and her daughter for her. A baby isn\u2019t cognizant you realize? Come on now. Looking for perceived insults is exhausting. To be clear, it\u2019s strange that that is what you took away from  from that.", "Umm I really doubt she wants an 18 year old boy she doesn\u2019t even know alone with her baby girl. She probably just wants them to have a relationship, that\u2019s not surprising or out of the ordinary.", "I'm not critizing what you wrote or insulting it in any way!  I agree with everything you said and I was just trying to support it.  I apologize if it came off as negative!  I'm half asleep over here, lol.", "But why now? She had years to contact him and didn\u2019t seem to make an attempt all these years. Now she has a child, she does. I think she just wants a free babysitter when SIL and deadbeat dad want to go out. Doesn\u2019t sound like she genuinely cares about her step son. And step son doesn\u2019t want to be a part of their life nor does he want to know anything. It must be hurtful for him to see that deadbeat dad sticks around his half sisters life but never cared about him.", "NTA\n\nIt drives me absolutely nuts when ppl do this shit.\n\nIf a kid doesn\u2019t want to be contact by their birth parent or any extension of that, you back the f off.  \n\nShe had no right to do that and needed to be told off", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nShe's just trying to rope Jax in to babysitting", "NTA", "NTA It\u2019s bizarre that she feels she has any right to contact him or thinks he might be interested.  She needs to leave Jax alone and have a serious talk with her husb/your brother instead.", "NTA It\u2019s bizarre that she feels she has any right to contact him or thinks he might be interested.  She needs to leave Jax alone and have a serious talk with her husb/your brother instead.", "NTA", "A genuine rule: \"don't force relationships on someone\"\n\nNTA", "NTA if she wants the best for her daughter Married your brother is wrong choice she made. If jax don't want to be in your sil's daughter life it his choice.", "NTA if she truly wanted to have a relationship with Jax, she should start doing the effort when she was engaged with the brother, she had 3 years to try to create a bond. Why did she waited??", "NTA. As someone with a deadbeat dad I understand exactly where Jax is coming from. And even if I didn\u2019t, it\u2019s his choice whether he wants to interact with your brother\u2019s family or not. I understand that your SIL wants Jax to be around his little sister, and that you may feel bad since she\u2019s PP, but you told her that he didn\u2019t want anything to do with them (it seems like) more than once. Also, why did SIL wait until she was having a baby to try and reach out to her husband\u2019s son? If she were truly interested in having Jax in their lives she would\u2019ve reached out sooner, baby or not.", "Funny how how your s.i.l was happy to keep Jax away from her before she had a child.", "I wouldn't have given her the number.\n\nI don't think Jax should give her the number.  It'll get shared even if her intentions are pure.\n\nI'm not sure i agree with Jax's position.  No he doesn't owe this woman anything but a phone call is low effort and the little sister might be a valuable person someday.", ">she wants the best for her kid\n\nSure, but not at the expense of Jax and his very clear refusal to take part in her little game of happy families.\n\nJax cannot make it any more clearer that he wants nothing to do with his dad and your SIL or their kid. She \\*IS\\* harassing him now. He's an adult, she needs to leave him alone.\n\nYou're NTA for pointing this out to him.\n\nI wouldn't blame him for getting a restraining order on her if she continues.", "NTA it's harsh, but she needs to accept her husband's past. He could be a good husband and father on her 2nd go through, but she needs to realize that he wasn't a father to Jax.", "Yeah. A deadbeat father is a major \ud83d\udea9. She should know better. But she doesn\u2019t seem like a good person anyways and everyone who marries these kinds of trash don\u2019t seem to care about their children either, since OPs brother doesn\u2019t make attempts to reconcile with his first son. Would be different if HE gains clarity and makes attempts but he doesn\u2019t do that at all!", "Doesn\u2019t look like that, since she only seemed to contact him after she got pregnant. So yeah, she probably only wants a free babysitter when she and deadbeat want to spent time together. \n\nAnd she married a man who is known to be a deadbeat, I don\u2019t know how you can miss that red flag when you are actually supposed to care for your children. Because if something happens to her, OPs bro will be a deadbeat to their daughter too.", "Why wasn\u2019t she concerned about that 3 years ago or when she was dating Jax\u2018s deadbeat father? A deadbeat father is major red flag, why doesn\u2019t she care about that if she is a good person? I believe she only wants a free babysitter but Jax is more concerned about school/Uni/work and friends, girlfriend etc. than his sister", "That\u2019s the main question I have: Does the brother know his wife has been reaching out to the son he abandoned? I wanna know what Mr. Deadbeat thinks.", "I also feel like SIL is trying to guilt OP by saying she (SIL) feels like OP is blaming her for the situation. It might not have been worded the best, but SIL knew about Jax and how her husband was NOT and has NOT been there for him for his whole life. But just because she\u2019s having a baby she feels entitled to be in Jax\u2019s life? SIL made herself upset imo", "I get that. But OP is related to Jax because of his father so that ship has pretty much sailed. He can continue to ignore his fathers existence. Also, I don\u2019t blame him for not wanting and I said before Jax is NOT TA. I think OP was TA. No one can blame the SIL for trying. Any person with a heart would understand that. No need to be rude. OP was taking her angry towards her brother and throwing it all on her SIL that had a valid point too. That\u2019s all. She could have said something like \u201che is hurt by his father, you need to step back and give him space. Respect his decision, maybe you can try again another time\u201d.", "This was my thought too! SIL knew about Jax before she got pregnant, and never reached out, but now all of a sudden she wants him in their lives? Because she \u201cwants the best for her child\u201d? She\u2019s delulu. If the husband didn\u2019t want Jax in his life all these years, what makes her think he\u2019ll want him now? Also, does she think the world revolves around her and her child?", "She hopped on the delulu train and still has yet to get off.", "What if SIL has another motive? To try and fix the relationship between her husband and the son he abandoned as well as have him in her daughter\u2019s life. Now I\u2019m not defending her actions, just stating a small possibility. I still think SIL is delulu about the reality no matter what her motives are.", "no means no, how fucking hard is it to get that?", "She didn't care about meeting him until she was pregnant. Her baby doesn't get a relationship when she doesn't even have one. It's selfcentered entitlement."]}
