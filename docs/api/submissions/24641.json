My brother has a son Jax (18) who was raised by his maternal grandparents from the age of 5 after his mom passed away. My brother was not part of Jax's life. I was. I have made an effort to be a big part of his life. I see him as much as possible. He has spent the night at my house several times. He's my nephew and I was never going to abandon him the way my brother did.\n\nSIL asked me to give her Jax's contact info when she was pregnant so she could tell him he was going to have a little sister. I told her that Jax did not want her or his dad to have the contact info and he already knew she was pregnant. She asked how and I told her I let him know, because he had always wanted to know if my brother or someone else in my brother's life might try to reach out to him. He's not interested. He's felt that way for years and I respect that. Having a half sibling coming into the world means nothing to him. As far as he's concerned he will always be an only child because he only has one parent, his mom.\n\nSIL decided to track Jax down on social media before her baby shower to invite him. He never replied and he didn't show, which I knew beforehand. SIL was upset about it and vented to me. I mostly ignored her. It was after my niece was born that the incident in question happened. \n\nSIL reached out to Jax again and was blocked and reported for harassment. She was upset and said it wasn't fair Jax was taking it out on her daughter and that she deserves to have her big brother in her life despite my brother's \"mistakes\" in letting him be out of his life. She was getting very blamey toward Jax and I did not want to hear it. I told her if she had wanted her child to have a big brother then she shouldn't have married a deadbeat dad, she shouldn't have married my brother, because they have ZERO right to expect Jax to want anything to do with any of them. SIL said Jax wanted me in his life. I told her I was there from day one and never let my brother's actions take me out of his life. I showed up when HE didn't and I stayed friendly with his grandparents and he saw that. I told her that SHE didn't get to demand anything from him when she knowingly married my brother.\n\nSIL said I was blaming her for no reason and I should be more understanding that as a mom she wants the best for her kid.\n\nAITA for what I said to her?", "created_utc": 1692037206, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15r2ip3/aita_for_telling_my_sil_she_shouldnt_have_married/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why I might have gone too far and crossed into AH territory is SIL did not abandon my nephew and is not responsible for my brother's actions. She is also newly PP and what I said might have been overly harsh for an emotional, new, first time mom.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ### [Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As a mom your sil should understand that being a parent is more than conceiving a child. It\u2019s showing up for that child. It is putting that child\u2019s wellbeing first. Dna does not make you family. \n\nYour nephew wants nothing to do with them. I am 100 percent sure he doesn\u2019t want to watch his half sibling have the dad he didn\u2019t have.", "NTA.  You were kind before and then just laid it all out on the table.  She didn't like hearing the truth, but that is on her, not you.  Neither you nor Jax owe her anything in particular and she'll probably find out why Jax couldn't care less.  SIL needs to understand that her daughter won't have a big brother in her life and that's just the way it goes.", "NTA, and she had better stay in good health because what does she think will happen to her daughter if something happens to her.", "NTA.  Jax has made it clear that he doesn\u2019t care if they share some genetic material.  They\u2019re not family to him.  She needs to respect his wishes.\n\nI do wonder if this is her way of \u201chiding\u201d that her husband has no problem abandoning a child.  When daughter gets older and finds out she has a brother, there will be questions.  But if she can force him in now, then they can just skip over that unpleasantness.", "NTA and SIL needs to come to the with the fact that her husband abandoned his first born.", "NTA but obviously, she is. She is not entitled to anything from him and needs to leave him alone. Her baby will be fine.", "NTA.  She asked a question, got an answer from you, an answer from Jax (an *adult*), then got blocked by Jax, and still has the audacity to complain?  Maybe she should have tried to start a relationship with Jax back when she first knew about him, and not when her motives were *all about her*.", "\"as a mom she wants the best for her kid.\"\n\nThen she shouldn't have married a deadbeat dad.  NTA, OP.", "Nta, his daughter maybe has a big brother in her life when she contacts him, but her mother has no right to pressure him to do anything. Her husband wasn't a father to his son, maybe she is scared that happens to her daughter too, but his son has nothing to do with it. His son is an adult now and can do or not do whatever he wants.", "NTA - Your brother abandoned your nephew. And his new wife now thinks he should just be okay with this and come around because now he technically has a half-sister. That's just ridiculous. She needs to grow TF up and realize how this is going to make him feel. His dad who couldn't be cared to hang around and raise him after his mother passed, but will now be sticking around to raise this kid. Honestly, she should be feel lucky he wants nothing to do with them because she's not going to have to deal with the huge resentment that this would cause. Your SIL is an asshole because obviously won't take no, I don't want anything to do with you guys, for an answer.", "SIL is a dummy. What does she really think is going to happen here?

Regularly hang out with the infant?\n\nSounds to me like she's hoping for some free childcare or something.", ">as a mom she wants the best for her kid\n\nAnd she thinks that forcing her kid on someone who has zero interest in it is what's good for it? Is she alright? \n\nNTA, this woman is an idiot.

Team Jax\ud83d\udc4f", "Sounds like you\u2019re doing a good job looking out for Jax. His feelings are more important in this situation than SIL\u2019s.

NTA", "NTA\n\nJust wondering how long before he abandons this kid too TBH", "NTA- Jax doesn't want this woman in his life. She needs to get over herself.", "NTA\n\n Why would he care that his dad has a new kid??", "NTA.   \nYou told her that Jax did not want contact, and she chose not to respect his wishes. \n\nYour SIL needs to understand that the person who abandoned him is still not reaching out, and while he may have a step-sister, he has no interest in creating any further ties to his father. What she is doing is hurtful to him, he has started a new family after leaving his former family...like salt in a wound. \n\nShe is being incredibly selfish, she is putting her *wants* over the needs of another child. While she may think her daughter would like a big brother, she does not have one - she never did. All your brother is to Jax is a sperm-donor, and I am glad that he has you and your grandparents.", "Nta, \u201cshe wants best for her kid\u201d yeah ONLY her kid. She doesn\u2019t care about how Jax feels", "NTA, but I'll go against the trend here and say neither is she. I am kind of admiring the fact she is trying to unite the family and who knows maybe in ten or twenty years something will change.\nThe only AH in this case is your brother, and in a huge way. Not only he deserted his son, he did not try to reach out when his wife died but he is not really reaching out now either.", "NTA - Were you really blaming her though? You told her the truth\u2026.a truth that she wants to ignore. I wonder how she thought this relationship would ever work (?) Was Jax just supposed to pretend like his dad didn\u2019t abandon him as he watches him be a dad to SIL\u2019s child?", "NTA & you couldn't have worded it better. She married a deadbeat who till now still isn't interested in getting to know his now adult son! Yet she expects said son to want familial contact? She wants the best for her kid but Jax also deserves someone looking out for him in the same way...which you have beautifully done with his real family & parents! I bet she's looking for who to cover baby sitting and what's her plan if jax had agreed to meet up? He should beg his father and apologize for his own dad not contacting him after years? Does she want a sibling that hates her kid?", ">as a mom she wants the best for her kid.\n\nThen she shouldn't have had a kid with a deadbeat father.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "This sounds like she may be secretly worried your Brother/her husband will abandon her and the baby like he did Jax. In a messed up way, she may see this situation like \u201cIf I can get him to care about Jax, he won\u2019t leave me and Daughter.\u201d No matter if this is accurate or not, it\u2019s still wrong of her to pressure Jax for her sake. That poor guy sounds like he has been through enough.", "NTA She needs a crash course in boundaries. She sounds like a good-intentioned habitual line stepper who has no idea the damage left in their wake.
