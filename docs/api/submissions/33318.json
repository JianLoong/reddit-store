{"id": 33318, "submission_id": "18lnxc2", "title": "AITA for telling my nosy SIL she's not entitled to my trauma?", "selftext": "This is more to vent than anything. \n\nBackground; I (34M) am married to my husband (36M) and we recently celebrated our 7 year anniversary. I adore my husband's family. They're so lovely and warm to me. I came from a very different place, none of which I remember fondly. A lot of the things I went through have left me with severe emotional and psychological trauma that I'm in therapy for and have been for about 4 years now. The only problem is my husband's youngest sister (22F) I'll call Kim.\n\nKim is nosy. She always feels like she needs to know about every aspect of a person's life. She targets this behavior towards me since I'm very private, especially about my past before I met my husband. I don't like talking about myself for very personal reasons, but that doesn't stop her from asking uncomfortable questions. Her parents and siblings have tried to talk to her about this, but it doesn't work. Normally I can brush off her questions, but this time I feel like she went too far. \n\nMy husband and I had a small party for our anniversary Saturday. Kim was there and she decided that she'd had enough of me ignoring her. During dinner, in front of everyone, Kim loudly demanded to know why I refused to talk about my past or my family. Why was I keeping so many secrets from them? Why won't I talk? She wouldn't let up. My husband, their parents, and our friends all told her to back off and sit down, but she wouldn't. I lost it. \n\nI got up and got in her face. I made myself just as loud as her. I told her she's not entitled to my past or my trauma. She doesn't need to know what happened to me. That she has no right to interagate and humiliate me in my own home, and that if she couldn't act like an adult then she needed to leave because I wasn't going to put up with her. \n\nI think I genuinely scared her. The entire room went dead silent. She tried to talk again, but every time she did I cut her off and told her to leave. She finally left. The rest of the guests also left not too long after since the mood was pretty much ruined. As soon as everyone was gone I broke down. My husband held me and comforted me as best he could. He told me how proud he was of me for standing up for myself. Something I've had trouble doing in the past. \n\nThe next morning I woke up to texts from Kim and her parents. I hate confrontation. My husband helped me go through them. Kim was saying I made her look like a bad person for just being curious and she expected an apology. My husband's parents thankfully were more understanding. They agreed that Kim had been the one in the wrong for starting with me, and I had every right to defend myself. My MIL thinks I could have handled it better and not stooped to Kim's level. My husband says I don't have to apologize, since Kim was the one in the wrong. My husband's parents said they'd talk to Kim, but we haven't heard anything. I'm really anxious.\n\nAITA for not wanting to talk about my past?", "created_utc": 1702944699, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18lnxc2/aita_for_telling_my_nosy_sil_shes_not_entitled_to/", "score": 806, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not at all.  \n\nI hate when people say that you shouldn't \"stoop to her level\".  She set the rules of engagement.  You were just defending yourself in obviously the only way that would get her to shut the hell up.", "NTA, bullies should be stood up to. You did well", "Your past is exactly two things: past and YOURS. I think you know the truth without a bunch of internet strangers jumping in. It seems like it took you getting down to her level to shut her up. She owes you a huge apology and I wouldn't have any contact with her until you get it if I were you. And let her know there  is forgiveness but not forgetting.", "NTA. Kim may also not understand that by pushing for your story, she is violating you all over again and triggering a trauma response. That is not an excuse. It is merely a potential explanation. There are others. She may genuinely trying to build a relationship. She may be unusually curious. Neither makes her behavior which ignores others\u2019 boundaries acceptable. An apology seems not to be necessary to anyone but her. You can either maintain your boundary where you set it or choose to flex it and to what extent. I can imagine, though, that her insensitive instrusiveness which became aggression heightens your unwillingness to share any more of your world with her.", "You have nothing..absolutely nothing to apologize for. Actually give yourself a pat on the back & stand tall. You just started a new journey of self discovery. IE: you stood up for yourself. That\u2019s awesome! Don\u2019t you dare apologize or feel bad. She had it coming. Congrats & Happy Holidays. NTA.", "NTA. Everyone kept warning her and telling her to knock it off. Her family has said things to her before. Clearly they were not trying hard enough and zero boundaries have been set. \n\nShe needed a sterner telling off and you I think you were entitled to go off on her after years of this. She should not be welcomed to be around you until she sincerely apologizes and promises not to ask another personal question of you. \n\nYour husband needs to back this up and enact consequences. This is his family to deal with. Honestly, he's an AH for continuously allowing his sister to treat you like this. Anyone who did this to my husband would never come into our house.", "NTA and block Kim. Her behavior is unacceptable. If your husband wants to see her, let him. But never allow her back in your home again, for any reason.", "NTA.  I think you handled it brilliantly. People like Kim need to be confronted like that. She can dish it, but she can't take it. She thought bullying you in a semi-public setting would get what she wanted. But instead,  she got what she deserved.  So she's playing the victim. Boo-hoo. Play stupid games,  get stupid prizes.\n\nThe only response to her whining texts should be, \"When YOU are ready to apologize and act like a decent mature adult, you are welcome back. Until then, you are not.\" And that message should come from both you and your husband.", "NTA. It's up to you to decide who you want to share your past with. There's no right way to handle a situation like that when your SIL wouldn't take a hint before it escalated. I also think you shouldn't apologize, but that's up to you.", "NTA\nShe was way out of line. Good for you standing up for yourself. Glad to hear your husband and in-laws are so supportive.", "NTA.  She was incessantly nosy against the comments of literally everyone around her.  She does not deserve an apology.  It would be nice if she would apologize to you, but it doesn't sound like she realizes what she has done wrong yet.", "NTA, your hubby is right and im proud of you for standing up fir yourself, too. She'd been warned, crossed boundaries, so she shouldnt get an apology.\n\nEdit: if she asks again, shut her down with \"sorry, trauma doesn't make for pleasant talk.\" And ignore any further attempts\n\nIf she still continues to cross boundaries, maybe talk with your husband about what circunstances you interact. Such as, not in your house", "NTA.  You need to message her back and tell her that she needs to apologize for trying to bully you into doing what she wants you to do.  Your life is not a soap opera and is not up for discussion at any time.  Tell her she is not welcome in your house until she has done so.", "Absolutely positively NTA! And I\u2019m proud of you for standing up for yourself! You\u2019ve ignored her the best you could but she continues to push and push. She\u2019s most definitely in the wrong and you do not need to apologize. She needs to apologize to you!!! A person can only take some much pushing before they snap, and that\u2019s what happened. Your husband needs to address his sister\u2019s disrespectful behavior with her privately.", "NTA\n\n\"My MIL thinks I could have handled it better and not stooped to Kim's level.\" I'm raising a pink flag with this one. Kim kept gunning for you and as you said, you \"lost it\". You were defending yourself. If Kim had been hitting you, you would have the right to punch back.\n\nTell MIL that you also need an apology from her for this and for raising her daughter to be a verbally abusive brat. Kim was abusing you - flat out. And you have MORE than a right to defend yourself. Explain this to MIL in no certain terms and block Kim from everything. She has no place in your life until she changes her behavior and apologizes sincerely for traumatizing you.", "NTA. She\u2019s crossing boundaries. Her behaviour is ridiculous.", "I think it\u2019s funny (in an ironic way), that she thinks you made her look bad.  She pretty much did that all herself. Good for you!!  NTA.", ">My MIL thinks I could have handled it better and not stooped to Kim's level.\n\nYou didn't stoop to Kim's level, you made sure she could hear you over the sound of her own obnoxiously rude demands. **You stood up for yourself in the only way left to you in those circumstances.**\n\nThe fact that your MiL is saying that you were wrong in any way is a red flag. She knows that she allowed her daughter to behave in that manner and never put a stop to it when Kim was young. They both owe you an apology.\n\nI'm glad your husband is standing with you on this, but he needs to not only tell YOU that you're right, he needs to make it perfectly clear to *his entire family* that he's supporting you in this and that future outbursts from ***anyone*** like this will also not be tolerated by him.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n>Kim was saying I made her look like a bad person for just being curious\n\nAbsofuckinglutely NOT! \n\nSHE made herself look like an ass by harping on your undisclosed to her history and demanding to know about things she is completely and utterly NOT entitled to know. \n\nSHE did that to herself and is suffering directly from the consequences of her own actions.  \n\nShe owes you, and everyone else who was there, a direct and sincere apology for what she did. \n\nShe picked and poked you until you finally had enough of her garbage and told her in no uncertain terms to back off and leave you alone. \n\nYou are NEVER an asshole for standing up for yourself. \n\nGood on you for putting that nosy little brat in her place!", "Nta. Just not. Period. She now knows how you feel, and that you WILL defend yourself. DO NOT APOLOGIZE. if you do, it'll open it up all over again.", "NTA, and the fact Kim expects- and thinks she deserves!- an apology shows she not only has not learned her lesson but is likely to continue leaping across any boundary she finds inconvenient. She needs to be shut down in no uncertain terms.\n\nI'd also add your MIL making excuses for her needs addressing, as well. Put a stop to this nonsense now and let these people know you are in control of your own past history and it is yours to share, or not, as you see fit, and you will not be mistreated or disrespected for your decision.", "NTA People like Kim, if you give an inch, she will take a yard. What you did was exactly what you needed to. Now all you need to do is keep it up. Personally, I would text Kim back and say \u201cI didn\u2019t make you look like a bad person, you did that all on your own. Especially when you couldn\u2019t read the room and listen to EVERYONE tell you it\u2019s not your business and to stop. But no, you chose to try and demand information that you have no right in knowing, you chose to do this publicly, in front of friends and family, during a party celebrating my birthday.\u201d", "NTA. ANd well done for being able to say what you needed to say. I hope this is a turning point for you & you are always able to stand up for yourself now!", "NTA - they\u2019ve raised a nightmare and don\u2019t want to admit.", "There are some people in the world who, for whatever reason, don't hear things, don't change their behaviors, and don't acknowledge others unless you treat them a bit like shit.\n\nKim seems like that kind of person and there's no reason to feel sorry for giving her essentially exactly what she needed/wanted.  Asked and answered.  Anyone seeing fault in what you said or how you said it can suck a dead dog's nose.\n\nI've said that same type of thing before.  We don't owe anyone our trauma in order to be respected.  Let go of the idea that Kim's hurt is somehow greater than yours (as apparently she, and perhaps a bit your MIL thinks) when she is the cause of her own discomfort.\n\nLean into your husband and the part of you that said: no more.  That's healthy.  Go with healthy.", "NTA\n\nSome possible responses:\n\n\u201cKim, if your questions were reasonable then nothing I said or did could have made you look like a bad person. You\u2019ve been asked repeatedly not to ask me those sorts of questions. Don\u2019t contact me again unless it is to apologise.\u201d\n\n\u201cMIL, thanks for agreeing Kim\u2019s level was so low it required stooping. I disagree with any suggestion that I went as low as her and respectfully suggest that if you think it could have been handled better, you could have intervened.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m glad you have your husband\u2019s support, but he needs to reiterate that support with his entire family and make it clear there is now a zero-tolerance policy that he will be enforcing.", "NTA. Do not apologize to her. She kept pushing you until you snapped. You have a right to privacy.", "NTA you were bullied and stood up for yourself .  Good for you.", "NTA\n\nAt all. \n\nBoth mother in law and sister in law are out of line. Your partner seems receptive to you, in your position I would tell him that I do not want to interact with his sister and that MIL interactions will be minimal. And I would not interact with SIL until she actually changes her behavior. Id accept an apology from MIL but I would not trust SIL apologies.", "Your pathetic SIL wants to get her thrills second-hand.  (Probably so she can gossip about it.). I recommend suggesting Jerry Springer reruns if she\u2019s so hard up for other people\u2019s life stories.", "So like the thing about trauma is IT MAKES YOU NOT HANDLE THINGS WELL.\n\nWhat's the sister's excuse? Because she can't handle basic conversational propriety well. How bad was her childhood to make her this inhuman?", "NTA. Just try to remind yourself this girl is 22 - young and dumb and living for the drama. We\u2019ve all been there (though maybe not so insufferably or rude or antagonistically).\n\nI think it would be good to workshop some one liner that shuts her down and that\u2019s all that you say when she asks something personal or pushes on you. If she conveys that it\u2019s juvenile, simply point out it\u2019s no more immature and disrespectful than how she is treating you and you hope she grows up and gets a life outside of her overbearing interest in others\u2019. \n\nWoof. NTA", "NTA a thousand times over. Kim is a nosy twit and you are absolutely right that whatever you've been through is none of her business. You reacted quite appropriately, since everyone else telling her to stop wasn't getting through to her, getting in her face was what finally got her to pay attention. You don't owe her an apology (or anything else), she owes you one for constantly badgering you and for not accepting your \"none of your business.\" \n\n>Kim was saying I made her look like a bad person for just being curious \n\nShe showed herself to be a bad person, you just finally called her out for it. Well deserved, and well done.\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc9b", "NTA - Kim is clearly in the wrong and to top it off she asks for an apology??  She's lucky she didn't get a slap", "NTA. She needs to mind her own business \n\nAnd something you said stood out to me. Your relationship with your husband must be really good. Those who have past trauma and have problems moving forward only make progress when they are in safe and comfortable places   the fact you for the first time were able to stand up for yourself, tells me your husband is a safe harbor for you.", "NTA. It could have been handled better if your SIL could take a hint, but she obviously needed a clue by four upside the head before there were any results. Don't apologize for standing up to a bully.", "You get to choose when and where and how you share your past trauma, if you ever choose to do so. NO ONE is entitled to know about it. Stooping to her level is the only way someone like that will ever understand that they need to stop prying. NTA.", "The number of stories of AHs demanding apologies for their AH behavior is hilarious. You are NTA. Your husband is awesome and it's good you have some support from the ILs. It sucks this took such a toll on you and that you have this history to work through. Kim can kick rocks. No apology from you and no enterqnce to your house ever since she can't be a good human.", "First of all, NTA! Not one little bit.\n\nI seriously had to go back and look at the age of the SIL. She is acting like a spoiled 3 year old child. \"I want to know! I wanna, I wanna, I wanna!!\" I'm surprised she didn't throw herself down on the floor and thrash about!\n\nOP, this Mom is so incredibly proud of you standing up for yourself. I'm proud of you. I'm proud that your husband has your back. I think he is the one who needs to make some really hard boundaries with his sister on your behalf. I think she should be banned from your home never to darken your doorstep again, however, I think what she did was irreprehensible and went on far too long. I think you have given her far too much grace because she is your sister in law.  I wish you the best.", "The fact that your SIL pulled this stunt at your anniversary dinner is absolutely unforgivable. You are NTA and you stood up for yourself which is commendable. Your SIL needs to apologize to you and your husband for behaving like an idiot while she was a guest in your home. If she doesn\u2019t apologize you go NC with her.", "NTA and may I suggest that for the next gift-giving occasions (I don't know if you celebrate Christmas or not) including birthdays, that yours to her are all psychology books about PTSD, and/or narcissism and/or bullying and emotional/social violence and/or, I dunno, basic manners or etiquette?  Yeah, let's start with that last one, basic manners.  You could find one packaged as advice for success in the world or something, but that girl needs some schooling.  You do not owe her an apology.  You did not ruin dinner or the party.  She was doing that all by herself and you just brought it all to a merciful and necessary end by lancing the festering boil of her persistent bullying of the vulnerable one in the room.  You could also turn the tables and ask, so, could you tell us more about what turned you into a bully?  Did your classmates call you a Mean Girl or is that still a term for you generation?", "NTA. You go girl! You have tried to enforce boundaries, her family has tried but lil Kimmy would not listen, so you made her listen. This internet stranger is proud of you for finding your voice. Sometimes you need to stoop to their level to make them understand you are not to be trifled with!", " NTA. She\u2019s mad she didn\u2019t get away with violating your boundaries. There were probably a couple things you could\u2019ve done to more gently nip it in the bud when you started to notice the patter rather than just assuming she can take a hint, but she\u2019s not entitled to that and maybe she wouldn\u2019t have been receptive to it. I would let your husband handle his family here.", "NTA at all. Your private information is none of Kim's business. Glad you stood up for yourself and your husband defended you. Go LC/NC with Kim for a while.", "NTA - She made herself look bad. No apology needed from you, it's her who should be doing the apologizing. Good for you for sticking up for yourself. Don't feel bad about it, it was a long time coming.", "NTA. Be proud of yourself for standing up to her. You are right. Your past is yours and she has no right to it. I hope she learned her lesson. \n\nIf she asks again, absolutely make up a banger of a lie. Tell her you're in witness protection. That you killed someone. That you're CIA. Something ridiculous. Hopefully she gets the message.", "NTA\n\nYou stood up for yourself and your husband backed you....you're golden.", "Not only are you NTA, you are a rockstar! Good for you!", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s great you were able to assert yourself against this intolerable behavior. But your husband should have nipped this bs in the bud BEFORE YOU WERE MARRIED.

I do not like to talk about my past either, it\u2019s very disturbing and I blocked a lot out, So I can see why being pushed & accused of \u201ckeeping secrets\u201d would upset you to that point. Do not apologize. She is the one that owes you an apology.", "NTA and don\u2019t back down.

I will say though that I think your parents in law deserve a little more attention on this though too. \n\nIt sounds like this started when she was 15? At that point it is the parent\u2019s responsibility to not only say \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d but also explain why it\u2019s unacceptable. It\u2019s not always instinctive **why** you shouldn\u2019t do something that you\u2019ve been told not to do. \n\nHopefully she will have finally learned a lesson about not pushing people to share information that she doesn\u2019t need to know after they say no.", "NTA.

Your continued politely telling her to shut the fuck up wasn't working, so drastic measures were required. \n\nHowever, I suspect this won't stop her. It'll just make her dislike you more, and probably start creating wild fantasies in her head about how horrible you are.

She can apologize to you and keep her questions to herself, or you'll be in your right to hand it right back to her all over again.  \n\nAnd if you don't hear anything from Kim, good!  She needs to seriously think about what she's doing.  She needed to be embarrassed.  She wasn't listening until you took it to her level.

OP seems to say that several times, he and his family have set limits that were probably not respected by Kim. It is SIL's choice to have crossed the limits established following the many times it has caused discomfort. Although it is hard to have reached this point, what was supposed to happen happened and OP to speak for itself. Was it the right time or the right place? Yes. Even if it was done in front of the guests, OP had to put an end to it alone because that's how Kim will understand. By humiliation.

It's clear to there was a level of malicious intent by now on SIL's part, so now it was time to get mean. *Nothing* else worked. I'd harp on that, honestly. That SIL was given *every* opportunity to not keep going, and yet now that she's been predictably burned by the fire she set, struck, and then poured gasoline on, *now* is when folks want to hound *OP* about his understandable and utterly predictable expression of anger and disbelief at SIL's audacity.\n\nI'd send my MIL something like that and tell her that I understand that she *feels* like she needs to mediate on behalf of her kid, but that clearly we need to put a short pause on speaking to one another while MIL processes *exactly* what behavior she's endorsing from her daughter via her defense.", "Nothing else was working.
