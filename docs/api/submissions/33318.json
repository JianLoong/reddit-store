{"id": 33318, "submission_id": "18lnxc2", "title": "AITA for telling my nosy SIL she's not entitled to my trauma?", "selftext": "This is more to vent than anything. \n\nBackground; I (34M) am married to my husband (36M) and we recently celebrated our 7 year anniversary. I adore my husband's family. They're so lovely and warm to me. I came from a very different place, none of which I remember fondly. A lot of the things I went through have left me with severe emotional and psychological trauma that I'm in therapy for and have been for about 4 years now. The only problem is my husband's youngest sister (22F) I'll call Kim.\n\nKim is nosy. She always feels like she needs to know about every aspect of a person's life. She targets this behavior towards me since I'm very private, especially about my past before I met my husband. I don't like talking about myself for very personal reasons, but that doesn't stop her from asking uncomfortable questions. Her parents and siblings have tried to talk to her about this, but it doesn't work. Normally I can brush off her questions, but this time I feel like she went too far. \n\nMy husband and I had a small party for our anniversary Saturday. Kim was there and she decided that she'd had enough of me ignoring her. During dinner, in front of everyone, Kim loudly demanded to know why I refused to talk about my past or my family. Why was I keeping so many secrets from them? Why won't I talk? She wouldn't let up. My husband, their parents, and our friends all told her to back off and sit down, but she wouldn't. I lost it. \n\nI got up and got in her face. I made myself just as loud as her. I told her she's not entitled to my past or my trauma. She doesn't need to know what happened to me. That she has no right to integrate and humiliate me in my own home, and that if she couldn't act like an adult then she needed to leave because I wasn't going to put up with her. \n\nI think I genuinely scared her. The entire room went dead silent. She tried to talk again, but every time she did I cut her off and told her to leave. She finally left. The rest of the guests also left not too long after since the mood was pretty much ruined. As soon as everyone was gone I broke down. My husband held me and comforted me as best he could. He told me how proud he was of me for standing up for myself. Something I've had trouble doing in the past. \n\nThe next morning I woke up to texts from Kim and her parents. I hate confrontation. My husband helped me go through them. Kim was saying I made her look like a bad person for just being curious and she expected an apology. My husband's parents thankfully were more understanding. They agreed that Kim had been the one in the wrong for starting with me, and I had every right to defend myself. My MIL thinks I could have handled it better and not stooped to Kim's level. My husband says I don't have to apologize, since Kim was the one in the wrong. My husband's parents said they'd talk to Kim, but we haven't heard anything. I'm really anxious.\n\nAITA for not wanting to talk about my past?", "created_utc": 1702944699, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18lnxc2/aita_for_telling_my_nosy_sil_shes_not_entitled_to/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not at all.  \n\nI hate when people say that you shouldn't \"stoop to her level\".  She set the rules of engagement.  You were just defending yourself in obviously the only way that would get her to shut the hell up.", "NTA, bullies should be stood up to. You did well", "Your past is exactly two things: past and YOURS. I think you know the truth without a bunch of internet strangers jumping in. It seems like it took you getting down to her level to shut her up. She owes you a huge apology and I wouldn't have any contact with her until you get it if I were you. And let her know there  is forgiveness but not forgetting.", "NTA. Kim may also not understand that by pushing for your story, she is violating you all over again and triggering a trauma response. That is not an excuse. It is merely a potential explanation. There are others. She may genuinely trying to build a relationship. She may be unusually curious. Neither makes her behavior which ignores others\u2019 boundaries acceptable. An apology seems not to be necessary to anyone but her. You can either maintain your boundary where you set it or choose to flex it and to what extent. I can imagine, though, that her insensitive instrusiveness which became aggression heightens your unwillingness to share any more of your world with her.", "You have nothing..absolutely nothing to apologize for. Actually give yourself a pat on the back & stand tall. You just started a new journey of self discovery. IE: you stood up for yourself. That\u2019s awesome! Don\u2019t you dare apologize or feel bad. She had it coming. Congrats & Happy Holidays. NTA.", "NTA. Everyone kept warning her and telling her to knock it off. Her family has said things to her before. Clearly they were not trying hard enough and zero boundaries have been set. \n\nShe needed a sterner telling off and you I think you were entitled to go off on her after years of this. She should not be welcomed to be around you until she sincerely apologizes and promises not to ask another personal question of you. \n\nYour husband needs to back this up and enact consequences. This is his family to deal with. Honestly, he's an AH for continuously allowing his sister to treat you like this. Anyone who did this to my husband would never come into our house.", "NTA and block Kim. Her behavior is unacceptable. If your husband wants to see her, let him. But never allow her back in your home again, for any reason.", "NTA.  I think you handled it brilliantly. People like Kim need to be confronted like that. She can dish it, but she can't take it. She thought bullying you in a semi-public setting would get what she wanted. But instead,  she got what she deserved.  So she's playing the victim. Boo-hoo. Play stupid games,  get stupid prizes.\n\nThe only response to her whining texts should be, \"When YOU are ready to apologize and act like a decent mature adult, you are welcome back. Until then, you are not.\" And that message should come from both you and your husband.", "NTA. It's up to you to decide who you want to share your past with. There's no right way to handle a situation like that when your SIL wouldn't take a hint before it escalated. I also think you shouldn't apologize, but that's up to you.", "NTA\nShe was way out of line. Good for you standing up for yourself. Glad to hear your husband and in-laws are so supportive.", "NTA.  She was incessantly nosy against the comments of literally everyone around her.  She does not deserve an apology.  It would be nice if she would apologize to you, but it doesn't sound like she realizes what she has done wrong yet.", "NTA, your hubby is right and im proud of you for standing up fir yourself, too. She'd been warned, crossed boundaries, so she shouldnt get an apology.\n\nEdit: if she asks again, shut her down with \"sorry, trauma doesn't make for pleasant talk.\" And ignore any further attempts\n\nIf she still continues to cross boundaries, maybe talk with your husband about what circunstances you interact. Such as, not in your house", "NTA.  You need to message her back and tell her that she needs to apologize for trying to bully you into doing what she wants you to do.  Your life is not a soap opera and is not up for discussion at any time.  Tell her she is not welcome in your house until she has done so.", "Absolutely positively NTA! And I\u2019m proud of you for standing up for yourself! You\u2019ve ignored her the best you could but she continues to push and push. She\u2019s most definitely in the wrong and you do not need to apologize. She needs to apologize to you!!! A person can only take some much pushing before they snap, and that\u2019s what happened. Your husband needs to address his sister\u2019s disrespectful behavior with her privately.", "NTA\n\n\"My MIL thinks I could have handled it better and not stooped to Kim's level.\" I'm raising a pink flag with this one. Kim kept gunning for you and as you said, you \"lost it\". You were defending yourself. If Kim had been hitting you, you would have the right to punch back.\n\nTell MIL that you also need an apology from her for this and for raising her daughter to be a verbally abusive brat. Kim was abusing you - flat out. And you have MORE than a right to defend yourself. Explain this to MIL in no certain terms and block Kim from everything. She has no place in your life until she changes her behavior and apologizes sincerely for traumatizing you.", "NTA. She\u2019s crossing boundaries. Her behaviour is ridiculous.", "I think it\u2019s funny (in an ironic way), that she thinks you made her look bad.  She pretty much did that all herself. Good for you!!  NTA."]}
