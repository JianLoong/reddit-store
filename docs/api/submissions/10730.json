It was the first time I made money from my art, and it was a big deal to me that my mom went out of her way amongst the cosplay clad teens and young adults to find a mug from an obscure anime that she knew I wanted but had no merch of. As a result, I\u2019ve used this mug MAYBE a dozen times since I got it at 19. The only other person who has used it is my mom because I only had that mug when I moved out.\n\nI am now what my family jokingly calls an avid \u201cmugger\u201d. I have over 80 mugs. 13 are seasonal and packed up when it\u2019s not their time, 5 are regular decorations and besides my Special Mug, I have two other mugs that are rarely used, but they\u2019re packed away since they\u2019re event mugs. I hand wash all my mugs since most won\u2019t survive the dishwasher and I don\u2019t want to forget. Anyone can use any of my non-decorative/special mugs. That means there\u2019s over 60 mugs people are able to use, or that I use on a regular basis.\n\nMy boyfriend has one mug that he rinses out and uses daily. When he washes it, he tosses it in the dishwasher, resulting in the paint flecking off and me usually having to rewash the rest of the dishes. He has put three of my mugs in the dishwasher and ruined them. He replaced two but one he couldn\u2019t so he\u2019s still looking for it. As a result, I\u2019ve told him he can\u2019t even TOUCH my Special Mug because if anything happens to it I will be crushed.\n\nWell, I got sick last week and couldn\u2019t do dishes. He was doing all the dishes and assured me he wasn\u2019t washing the mugs I was drinking tea out of, and that he just rinsed them out so I could hand wash them later. Surprise surprise, he broke his single mug, and used my Special Mug. He then washed it in the dishwasher. Now the paint is messed up, there\u2019s a crack on the side, and it just looks so messed up. I cried all morning and when he came home I told him to leave since he never wanted to be put on the lease, so this is still my place. He offered to replace it, but it\u2019s not the same. It\u2019s the one thing I have that I didn\u2019t want him to touch, and out of over 60 mugs, I don\u2019t understand why he picked one that he knows means so much to me.\n\nAITA? It is just a $30 mug\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t use the mug every day. I literally think I\u2019ve used it ten times and my mom did once. It\u2019s in a separate cabinet with plastic kid cups that we rarely use. Most mugs are stamped with a \u201chand wash only\u201d stamp on the bottom, so I use hand wash them all in case they get rubbed off and I forgot. Many people have dropped my mugs and broken them, including him and my cat. That doesn\u2019t bother me because accidents happen, it\u2019s the fact he used THAT MUG and put it in the dishwasher when he could have hand washed it, or just never went into that cabinet and used it in the first place.\n\nHe\u2019s also safe back at his parents\u2019 MIL suite, and he\u2019s gotten most of his stuff from here since most of his stuff was still there.", "created_utc": 1677179062, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11a5r5e/aita_for_kicking_my_boyfriend_out_because_of_a_mug/", "score": 366, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A boundary is a boundary", "NTA\n\nHighlight from one of your response comments - \n\nHe does not allow her to do the laundry when he is gaming because he can hear it go off when it finishes. \n\nOP. Do not have dinner with this man. Do not allow him back into YOUR home. There are so many red flags here - dump him in public or via phone.

This is a man who is systematically breaking you down and attempting to exert power and dominance over you. Thank that mug - it\u2019s damage is saving you from a bad bad situation.", "Yes, yta.", "Honestly? NTA. That's a reflection on how he treats YOU.", "NTA you don't want to live with his constant little \"fuck you\" gestures. Life is short, stay away from people who want to ruin it for you.", "Who is the artist, I want to help you find a replacement", "NTA it isn't just about a mug. It's about him not respecting your things and going out of his way purposefully choosing the on thing you asked him not to touch, when he had 60 other mugs to choose from. It's about him not respecting you. \n\nYou're making the right decision.", "NTA. If he can\u2019t respect your property and boundaries then he doesn\u2019t need to be in your life. Plain and simple.", "NTA. He knew that mug was important to you. This wasn't an accident. He did this on purpose.", "he either doesn't care at all about your feelings and mugs, or he deliberately destroyed your mug because he thinks negatively of your collection. NTA", "NTA, your mom bought it for you! That\u2019s so sweet as an avid con goer, I know how overwhelming it can be to go through the crowds, and the fact she bought it  for you!? So sweet! What anime was it from", "This is not about a mug. This is about him not respecting your stuff. That special mug had a very special memory tied to it and you told him time and time again not to touch it. Not only did he touch it, he nearly destroyed it.\nAnd like you said, he had several other mugs you\u2019ve allowed him to use and he still went after your special mug. \nWhich means one of two things.\n1) he doesn\u2019t listen/doesn\u2019t care therefore is not mature enough to be in a relationship or \n2) he wanted to test you and see how far he could take his incompetence with you before you\u2019d react like you did. \n\nBoth are stupid. \n\nThis so reminds me of This Is Us when Kate asked her boyfriend Marc not to use her dad\u2019s mug and he purposely dropped it to show her who\u2019s boss (or at least who he thought was boss). This was a power move. It\u2019s toxic and gross.\n\nI feel like your bf was leading up to this.", "NTA\n\nYou know the saying, \"when they show you who they are, believe them\".

That specific mug had sentimental value for you - he didn\u2019t care. If he cared about you then the fact that it mattered to you would have been enough. \nThere were literally dozens of other mugs he could have used, you asked him to not use that one and put it in a separate cabinet. He didn\u2019t just fail to respect the boundary you\u2019d set for your property - he went out of his way to break it. That shows total disrespect and that\u2019s not something you should accept in a relationship. Honestly given what you\u2019ve said about the numerous other mugs available and that one being in a different cabinet, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this wasn\u2019t a deliberate \u201cF you\u201d from him. Why would you ever want to continue in a relationship with someone who disrespects you?", "NTA. This is about respect for you and your personal items.", "[removed]", "NTA. The price is not important. What is important is his lack of care on your things in general. And, as you said, you had 60 mugs, but he cared so little he went for the only one you forbid. I am so sorry.", "NTA since you specifically told him not to touch that one mug. People might think you're overreacting but that mug holds an extreme amount of sentimental value to you. You told him not to touch it and he didn't listen. NTA at all", "NTA.  It was special to you and he knew that.  He didn't care enough.  \n\n\nNote:  This is coming from someone who gets supremely annoyed with the amount of mugs my wife has.  They hold no special sentimental value to her (per her) and she even admits that she has too many mugs.", "NTA\n\nThis is not about the mug, but about the fact that he wouldn't listen to your completely simple request. \n\nHe does not respect you, and he has shown you that over and over. \n\nHonestly, to me this is an absolute relationship ender, and it's time for you two to go your separate ways.", "NTA. \n\n1. he lied and said he was rinsing the mugs, obviously not he put it in the dishwasher. \n2. he has done this multiple times and it\u2019s really not hard to remember mugs don\u2019t go in the dishwasher\n3. he is sending you passive aggressive snapchats \n4. he tried to HIDE WHAT HE DID???\n5. he broke his own mug and went for one of your sentimental ones. \n6. he didn\u2019t want to be put on the lease even though you said your landlord wouldn\u2019t care\n\nhonestly\u2026 that\u2019s all.. ridiculous. in my mind, that\u2019s break up worthy. i know reddit runs to breakups, but.. he\u2019s giving you multiple examples of not respecting you or frankly not giving a flying F about your possessions.", "NARRATOR: it wasn\u2019t about the mug\u2026\n\nThis feels like it was OP\u2019s last straw. \n\nNTA", "I\u2019m assuming he was living with you. \n\nNTA unless you expect him to stay in a relationship with you and/or move back in after a period of time.\n\nHe is definitely the AH for ignoring your wishes, and damaging your property.  Only you get to decide if it\u2019s worth ending a relationship over.\n\nThat said, kicking someone out of where they live IS a relationship and trust killer.", "NTA. Especially with it in a different cabinet and having to be gotten intentionally? Does not feel like an accident.", "NTA. But I am curious. When he apologized, what did he say? Did he say (1) he got the wrong mug, just grabbed one and made a mistake, and forgot about the dishwasher rule, or did he say (2) something akin to \"I don't know why it was so big a deal, it's just a mug\"?\n\nI mean, you were right to break up with him anyway. If it's (1), he's just careless, which is obviously bad enough. But if it's (2), then he did it on purpose because the mug was dear to you and he thought it ridiculous and wanted to \"prove it\"...and it's so much worse. Like those people who don't think people are really allergic and want to test it. There is something really mean, something deeply destructive behind this attitude.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t about the mug, this is about respect. This man does not respect you enough to hand wash freaking dishes that he doesn\u2019t even need to use in the first place. That\u2019s a pretty low level of respect, I cannot imagine what he\u2019s like in the rest of your relationship.", "NTA\n\nThis is pure disrespect, plane and simple and it appears to have been a consistent issue.  The fact that he went to that specific mug was purposeful.  \n\nDon't let him back into your life.  You deserve someone who respects you.", "NTA\n\nHe freaked out at you, forbid you from walking on \"his side\" of the bedroom, and rearranged furniture because you ONE TIME knocked over a bottle that didn't even break, and all you did was ask him not to use this one specific mug, and not to put mugs in the dishwasher. He won't let you do laundry in the office chance he hears the washer buzzer go off while he's gaming. (That buzzer can usually be turned off or set to a different volume, btw.) He doesn't respect you or your needs at all. Good for you for throwing him out, please find someone who respects you and understands that the things that are important to you should therefore be important to them (or at least not deliberately ruined.)", "NTA. The easiest thing to do would be, especially since he knows he\u2019s ruined your mugs multiple times before, for him to just hand wash all the mugs he uses. He is actively and maliciously destroying things he knows you care about. This is a relationship-ending act, and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve had to deal with this kind of intention destruction of your belongings for so long.", "NTA. As a fellow mugger I'm absolutely gutted for you.\n\nYour partner should care enough to respect the things that are important to you. That's what someone who loves you does.\n\nA friend of mine accidentally broke one of my mugs last year (one I didn't care for fortunately) and he was so mortified (despite me telling him it's no big deal) that since then, whenever he stays at my place he goes looking for the one tin mug I have and only uses tjat, carefully washing it by hand.\n\nAnd that's a friend! Not a partner who supposedly loves me!\n\nYou're not kicking him out because of a mug, but because he's shown you time and time again that he doesn't care about you. And frankly I think he did this on purpose. What a shitty guy.\n\nBy the way, I would absolutely love to see your mug collection. I'm sure it's beautiful.", "I too have a mug collection (not as big) and I also have a \"Special mug\" that I take a lot of care in not letting it get damaged.\n\nMy fiance never touches it unless I specifically hand it to him to use. He asks if he can put other mugs in the microwave/dishwasher before doing so (I have general junk mugs that I don't care about breaking). He will hand-wash my select mugs if he takes them to the sink.\n\nI'm all for compromise and picking your battles. However he KNOWS you have a passion for collecting and keeping your mugs from unnecessary wear and tear. He KNOWS you have a specific mug that you LOVE and would be crushed if something happened to it. You think he would think twice about even looking at it, let alone blatently disregarding what you said on how care for it. It seems deliberate. \n\nIt's not about mugs. It's about respect. Or disrespect. \n\nNTA", "NTA. As soon as you mentioned how his habit of chucking a disintegrating mug in the dishwasher creates extra work for you and he doesn\u2019t give a shit, it became clear that this guy is an inconsiderate ass. You deserve someone who respects the things you cherish and helps you instead of making your life harder. \n\nYour post reminded me of this and it is what I wish for you: \n[Cute Mug Wall](https://www.buzzfeed.com/daniellaemanuel/man-built-wall-girlfriend-mug-collection)", "NTA it may be \u201cjust a mug\u201d but it clearly has sentimental value and he clearly doesn\u2019t care", "Yes it's just a mug but he is incredibly stupid. After reading some comments he doesn't even seem that bothered by this whole situation, so I guess you are not the asshole here.", "NTA, but he sounds more like an idiot than a malicious person.

Indeed, how could he? It has far more significance than you could ever put into words and he could ever imagine. \n\nHowever, he could certainly try relating by thinking of possessions that mean a lot to him. And if he does not have any or does not place such significance on objects/memorabilia/collections, then he should respect that you do. \n\nJust because he doesn\u2019t \u2018get it\u2019, does not mean he should ignore your heartfelt feelings about it.\n\nI\u2019m sad that his ignorance has resulted in your parting, but again, as others have commented, it\u2019s not just about a mug.

It's not about a $30 mug, it's about what that mug meant to you and how he doesn't respect your personal boundaries and feelings.
