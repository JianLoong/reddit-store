It isn't just a petty reason against the name, it is entirely dumb. Tbh when she finally leaves him you should see if she will take you with her to her family as part of the settlement.", "Your brother sounds exhausting. The fact he refuses to allow his child to be named after the baby's late grandfather because a CHARACTER he's jealous of has the same name is nothing but insecure. I doubt he will be with Sandra for long but NTA. Someone needs to bring him to reality since your mom is babying him. Also, I don't think you're overstepping any more boundaries than the inlaws. If the inlaws can say they like the name why wouldn't you be able to too? Your mom and brother just want you to be a mindless follower orf the family.", "What your brother is doing is abusive. I hope for your SILs sake that his behaviour doesn\u2019t escalate. \n\nIt may not be your place, but I\u2019m glad you\u2019re keeping an eye on things.

Your mother and brother are wrong to treat her this way. It's gross.", "NTA\n\nHowever, to be fair, Cillian Murphy is highly swoon-worthy.", "NTA. I mean, you probably are overstepping boundaries insofar as outside opinions on baby names are needless unless actively sought. But you are absolutely right in your characterisation of his behaviour.", "NTA, but christ this relationship sounds toxic.", "NTA, your brother is showing excessive controlling behaviour and even though the baby's name is none of your business, you may be the only one in the family that can actually give perspective to your sister in law that she is being unreasonably treated.", "Tell your brother to be for fucking real. Like he didn't find Rachel McAdams hot in that movie? As if. He seems insecure, a little controlling and toxic? I think Sandra should honestly dump him IMHO. Because if he is picking fights like this over a damn movie character... He needs to get it together. Sbe's naming the baby after her father, not some movie crush, and even then I wouldn't see the issue.

I genuinely hope she sets boundaries or leaves him cause I\u2019ve been there. The whole tantrum over saying someone was pretty just shows you the surface level. Behind closed doors who knows how much he actually loses it over. Your brother doesn\u2019t want a partner he wants a play thing. He doesn\u2019t think of SIL as a person at all.\nMy advice: stay out of it and at most let SIL know you\u2019re in her corner cause that shit is traumatic even if it\u2019s not physically violent. Your parents are clearly enablers but I\u2019m glad OP isn\u2019t trying to.", "NTA and your mom is trouble", "Yes, your brother is being creepy and controlling. NTA.", "NTA, if SIL was naming the baby after an old flame or crush, I would understand the brothers reaction. But it's her fathera name.\n\nHe has to realise that her finding others attractive is not a reflection or threat to how she feels about him. She's married, not dead! If he was making reasonable decisions, I would say stay out of it, but he needs to have his jealousy called out. Your mother can't keep blaming the wife for his behaviour.", "ESH except Sandra. Yes, your brother's reasoning here is creepy and controlling. No, you don't have to always side with blood over inlaws like your mother and brother seem to think. But you're included a little bit because it's not your child or relationship to argue about (giving your opinion once if your brother is interested in hearing it is fine, but this seems like more than that). \n\nWho knows, maybe this will finally be the point at which Sandra realizes she doesn't need this kind of jealous, possessive control in her life. And imagine that she DOES name the child this and your brother can't get over himself to be a decent father to his child because of the name? That's the scariest outcome.", "NTA - it\u2019s clear that your mother is enabling her sons toxic behaviour! Keep calling him out at every opportunity you have. Because at the end of the day no matter who a person is to you, it\u2019s not right to condone bullying behaviour. Blood is thicker than water but so is yoghurt! For him to get that angry and aggressive over something as petty as a character in a movie speaks volumes. Behaviour like this starts off as small but more often than not grows into something much worse! And we often never truly know what happens behind closed doors.", "I\u2019m typing this as someone who hates the name our first child has. \nI had wanted one particular name since I was a teenager. Hubby didn\u2019t like it. No real reason, just didn\u2019t like it (plenty of names I also didn\u2019t like so I understand it no matter how upsetting it was/is). \nPeople dislike names for so many reasons. Just because we don\u2019t agree with it doesn\u2019t mean their opinions are less. \nWe could not agree on a name at three days after birth. We had got down to two before birth and hubby just couldn\u2019t decide between them. At day three he said \u2018what about xxxx?\u2019  \nI was so exhausted (and not a fan of being a mum at that point) so just said \u2018whatever\u2019 and that was then her name. \nShe\u2019s 8 now. Everyone told me it would grow on me. I\u2019d stop associating it with what I associate it with. They were wrong. I still hate it. I still get upset with hubby that he wouldn\u2019t let me have the name I wanted (so I get your SIL\u2019s side too) and I will probably always resent hubby slightly for sticking me with a name I dislike so much. \n\nYour brother faces feeling how I feel. That\u2019s not fair. Yes your SIL is also going to be sad for not having that name but they really do need to both agree on the name. Nobody is winning here.", "Mind your own business. This has nothing to do with you. Your mother is right : both parents need to agree on the name. \n\nYTA.", "Your brother needs to work on his insecurities that's for sure. But both parents need to agree on a baby's name YTA for meddling with this decision and saying your brother should just suck it up.
