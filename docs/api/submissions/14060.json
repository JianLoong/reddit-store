We have a hard cap of people allowed given the venues small size. We can only have 105 people, anything after that would not be allowed due to fire codes and venue policy. I have an older sister Mia who's life is a bit of a mess right now. She and her latest ex partner and dad of one of her kids broke up in the last 6 months. She has 4 kids and they are all living at my parents' house for the time being.\n\nWe opted to not have a childfree wedding after there being so much drama about it so Mia's 4 kids between 4 and 11 will be at our wedding. She recently got her invite that stated her name and her 4 kids names. She then called me and said \"I assume as an adult I also get a plus 1\". We told her no, she's not a in a serious relationship and she and her kids are already about 5% of our total guest list. Our caterer also doesnt charge less for kids so we're paying about $400 for those 4 kids to be there, we dont want to pay another $100 for some random that she'd bring. She's not dating anyone but said she could easily find a date or bring a friend to have someone to dance with. We told her she has 4 kids there, that should be more than enough instead of having a \"plus one\".\n\nMy dad is my side, and is tired of her taking up their house, my mom is a little more sympathetic and saying I should allow her to have a plus one because thats what you do for adults. Spending $600 on just my sister her kids and a date when she's not seeing anyone seriously just seems ridiculous to me though. She is pretty ticked off though.

It's your wedding and your money. If she wants to bring a plus one then let her pay the $100 it's going to be to feed that person. If your mom is all for it then she can pay for your sister to have a plus one.", "NTA. She has options. Attend as planned, stay home with the kids, leave the kids with a sitter and bring someone to dance with, or my favorite, STFU.", "NTA\n\nMia doesn't need to bring more people to the wedding. She is already dragging 4 kids (who are all very young) to your wedding, so why does she think she gets to bring a random \"date\" to this event?\n\nYou are already wasting hundreds of dollars on her alone. Why don't your other guests get this special treatment?", "NTA \n\nYour sister is not in a serious relationship.  105 people is a hard limit - I wouldn't want to fill up a slot for some random person when it can mean that you would have to kick someone you actually know and care about off the invite list.  I'm sure there will be someone at the weeding that she can dance with.", "NTA. I would tell her she can bring her kids OR a plus one. Let her choose. You win either way.", "NTA. I think you're being VERY generous allowing her FOUR CHILDREN to attend...and she had the nerve to ask for an additional person??  Wow.  She's a bit of a choosy beggar, isn't she?", "NTA. If she is taking her kids with her, who she is expecting to watch them when she dances?", "NTA.  She will be there with her 4 kids and her whole family, she doesn\u2019t need to bring some rando to keep her company.", "NTA\n\nHell it's not even just your rules (which would be enough on their own), if the venue has a cap it has a cap, fire codes don't care how old each occupant is.", "NTA. If she had a serious partner, that's one thing.  But she doesn't, so she doesn't need to bring a rando to your wedding.  She had 4 kids to keep an eye on, she'll be occupied lol", "NTA.  I don't even know where your mom gets off on saying \"that's what you do for adults.\"  You're not obligated to give anyone a +1 regardless of their age.  If your sister wants to dance with someone at the wedding, she can socialize with the other guests because that's what adults do.", "NTA\nI\u2019ve been on both sides of this. 1) It\u2019s not like you are telling her no plus one because you dislike her partner or similar. If no serious partner, shouldn\u2019t insist and doesn\u2019t matter who you are. As long as the rule applies for everyone, then it\u2019s fine. 2) limited guest caps are real and it\u2019s your wedding and your guest list and your money being spent.", "So if she brings a plus one, as well as the kids, then I have to ask...who the hell is going to be watching the kids? NTA.", "NTA It's really cute that she wants to wine and dine someone at your expense. A person you have never met and that she is not in a relationship with. I think that the wedding is about you and your future husband and should include people that you want to share the occasion with. If your sister can't have a good time without a date, then she should pay in advance for her date to attend. The wedding and reception are about the married couple after all. Who does she expect to babysit her children while she is dancing anyway? Are other people going to forgo the dancing and babysit so she can have a good time?\n\nSince you have limitations on how many guests you can invite and don't seem to have the extra money to spend, I think you are being reasonable.", "NTA. Your wedding, you get to decide. \n\nIf your mum wants to cave to her then your mum can pay the additional cost. Also I get the impression your sister may ramp it up and turn around and say she won't come if she doesn't get a plus one, do be prepared for that.", "NTA\n\n4 kids is more then a plus one", "NTA. Tell her she gets either to bring her kids OR get a +1. Not both. Her choice.", "NTA- but sis is ! Does she not get how much $$ this is costing?", "NTA \n\nEven if she did bring a +1 it doesn't sound like she really has good judgement in guys to bring someone you'd want around. Plus, if you give her a +1 how much time would she spend looking after her current +4 she's already bringing? Plus no one else is getting a +1 so it's not like you are singling her out for any reason.", "NTA.  She asked you answered.  Hold firm.", "NTA \n\nTell her if she really wants it then she can give you the money for it, your already paying so much for just her and her kids.", "NTA. You already caved to have the kids - she either gets a plus one or the kids. End of story", "NTA she isn't in a relationship.   She has family there she doesn't need to bring a random date \n\nThe only way I would give her a plus one is if she was already in a serious relationship when the invites came out", "NTA. You have a hard limit on the number of guests and have invited the people that are most important. I could maybe understand her being upset if she had been seeing someone seriously for a year or two or longer, but its a pretty normal thing for people not to get a plus one when they arent actually seeing someone seriously.", "NTA.", "NTA. She can dance with her 4 kids.", "NTA it seems like there\u2019s already been so much drama you\u2019ve been forced to cater to her needs just to keep the peace. Give her an inch and she tries to take a mile!!! Remind her that you\u2019re doing her a favour by not having your desired childfree wedding for her sake and that\u2019s where your charity on YOUR special day ends because this day is not about her.", "Info\n\nIn my culture, it's normal for the guest to gift money that is equal or greater than the cost for them to attend the wedding.\n\nFor example, if I came, I'd have to gift you $150. Which is $100 for cost of my meal + $50 as an actual gift. \n\nIs your sister paying this as well? I don't see a problem if she's gifting you $150 x 6 humans = $900 total. You'd get the $600 you spent on her back anyways.", "NTA, its YOUR wedding and honestly at that point I would tell her not to come at all. She sounds like a lot of drama and stress on a day that is supposed to be about you & celebrating your love for your spouse. Set boundaries and stick to them, and don't let anyone else manipulate you into giving in. The sister isn't ever gonna be happy, and will keep demanding more. So no more. As it is, it sounds like you *wanted* a childfree wedding and had to forego that specifically because of her. No. Its not her day, its not about her, and she isnt paying for anything. \n\nPersonally I would uninvite her & her kids entirely. Boundaries are hard but they exist for a reason. Stop stressing so much and focus on enjoying your special day.", "NTA. The day is not about her, and it's very sweet that you went out of your way to make sure your nieces and nephews are there. Explain that you had to bump a number of people off your guest list already to make sure your family is complete, ask her for some understanding. It sounds like she's touchy about being \"alone\" at a wedding because of her recent experiences, which is understandable.", "NTA, she\u2019s unreasonable and you shouldn\u2019t be expected to pay for a random person to attend your wedding.", "NTA.", "NTA", "Nope, NTA.\n\nShe isn't in a serious, committed relationship so why would you invite them? She's being entitled. I am sure your sister can dance with family and friends.", "NTA. It\u2019s not her day, or her money being spent.", "NTA, but those kids are pretty young, and you might find yourself extra irritated when she can't wrangle them all alone for the day", "INFO: Would her kids even eat the catering food? Legitimate question. I have a 4 year old that I know the catering would be wasted on. Depending on their age would it be possible to arrange another meal for them?", "If it\u2019s so important for her to have a date, suggest she pay for their cost. But regardless, I would special order those kids meals so you\u2019re not dropping $400 alone for young children. Expecting to be allowed to bring 4 KIDS and a guest at $100 a pop is cray. NTA", "NTA. What is this thing with people being unable to attend weddings unless they have someone with them? I\u2019ve gone to so many weddings on my own and had a great time. You presumably know at least one or two people at any wedding you\u2019re attending, and if she\u2019s your sister she knows a lot more, and it\u2019s not the end of the world to actually talk to some new people. Why do you need a \u201cplus one\u201d?", "OMG - NTA. If she doesn\u2019t want to come to your wedding without a date, she is welcome to stay home with her 4 spawn. Stand your ground!", "NTA \n\nTell her she can **either** have a plus 1 **or** her kids at the wedding. \n\nThat might give her some perspective. And if she does find someone to watch the kids and prefers to come with a date, maybe its for the better.", "NTA. Also, the reason some people like to bring a plus 1 is that they won't know anyone. Not the case for sister. Also,  who would be minding the 4 kids while she was with date? She can't just ignore whatever rando she drums up,  and it's not fair to pawn 4 kids off on other guests.", "She is 5% of the total guest list and **10% of your half** of the guest list.\n\nNTA", "Nta she has a +4!", "NTA, Your wedding your rules. Nothing else really matters.", "NTA, your wedding your choices. She should be grateful that her 4 kids are invited", "NTA", "NTA. When you have to count every single person, you have to keep your guest list short somehow. Not allowing any plus ones other than serious relationships is perfectly reasonable", "NTA.  Especially if you are shouldering the burden of wedding costs without help from parents.", "NTA", "NTA.  Stand your ground girl!", "NTA sounds like you should have stuck with the wedding being child free. People like her will always complain and want more, you should have the wedding you want instead of what others want and end up regretting it later.", "INFO: You don't seem to like her or her kids or want any of them there. Why are you inviting them at all?\n\nThis isn't really directly about being an AH, but if you've already invited her and her kids to keep the peace, then it seems like your options are either to let her have a +1 and save the hassle, or to accept that there's going to be massive drama anyway and cut her to save headcount. As it stands, you're getting like 70% of the drama of not inviting her *and* burning 83% of the headcount of letting her have a +1, which seems like the worst middle ground.", "INFO: does she have a \u201cplus-one\u201d she could bring not as a random date but as someone who can help wrangle her four young kids?

As someone with a four year old I would expect at least 60% of my time at a wedding to be child wrangling.  Add three more kids and I can't see how she would have any time to spend with a date.  And who wants to go on a date with someone and their four kids?  Even if it was just a friend, I would read that as 'come to this wedding to help me with my kids'.", "Also agree on NTA. The Being An Adult excuse doesn\u2019t vibe with me either because I\u2019ve been in wedding parties before and didn\u2019t get a plus one because they were so strict with how many people were allowed to come.

That's a reasonable and common way of handling the matter. I don't blame you for not wanting some rando you'll probably never see again at your wedding, doubly so with the venue's policy and cost. Sister is TA for throwing a tantrum because she isn't getting special treatment. It's extra absurd for her to demand to bring a casual date at a family wedding. She'll know plenty of other guests. I'm sure she can find someone to dance with \ud83d\ude44", "NTA. Give her a choice. Her kids or a +1.

Would be cheaper than the $400 you\u2019re paying for their meal.", "You could ask her if the plus 1 would be the nanny? I doubt she's going to be taking care of her 4 kids during the wedding...

I'm surprised by all the NTA, because your sister is not an asshole for wanting a plus one. Its very common for people to be allowed to bring a plus one to a wedding. I think her asking is totally normal. It's also fine for you to say no based on your reasons.\n\nI do feel like there's some judgement going on here. Like you seem annoyed that your sister is a mess and is bringing her kids to your wedding. If it bothers you, man up and have a child free wedding. It sounds like it would be cheaper anyways. \n\nEDIT: Also felt the need to add that it's weird to consider someone's children their plus one at a wedding in general. Your nieces and nephews are not strangers she's bringing along to the event. They're your nieces and nephews, and they're guests at your wedding, not \"plus ones.\"", "ETA. If she was in a serious relationship, I'd definitely say she should be allowed to bring her plus one.

I never thought much of it and certainly never requested a guest if one wasn\u2019t offered.

But after talking to him, he added my bf. I\u2019m going to another wedding in 2 weeks and I didn\u2019t get a plus one for that either, because of money constraints.

It's as simple as that IMO.", "Even if she was willing to pay extra I would still not want her to \u2018bring a date\u2019.

If you're a relatively minor guest it's maybe more normal, but if you're a central member of the wedding party or family then it feels odd to be bringing along a random date who doesn't know anybody all to well.
