We told her no, she's not a in a serious relationship and she and her kids are already about 5% of our total guest list. Our caterer also doesnt charge less for kids so we're paying about $400 for those 4 kids to be there, we dont want to pay another $100 for some random that she'd bring. She's not dating anyone but said she could easily find a date or bring a friend to have someone to dance with. We told her she has 4 kids there, that should be more than enough instead of having a \"plus one\". \n\nMy dad is my side, and is tired of her taking up their house, my mom is a little more sympathetic and saying I should allow her to have a plus one because thats what you do for adults.

It's your wedding and your money. If she wants to bring a plus one then let her pay the $100 it's going to be to feed that person. If your mom is all for it then she can pay for your sister to have a plus one.", "NTA. She has options. Attend as planned, stay home with the kids, leave the kids with a sitter and bring someone to dance with, or my favorite, STFU.", "NTA\n\nMia doesn't need to bring more people to the wedding. She is already dragging 4 kids (who are all very young) to your wedding, so why does she think she gets to bring a random \"date\" to this event?\n\nYou are already wasting hundreds of dollars on her alone. Why don't your other guests get this special treatment?", "NTA \n\nYour sister is not in a serious relationship.  105 people is a hard limit - I wouldn't want to fill up a slot for some random person when it can mean that you would have to kick someone you actually know and care about off the invite list.  I'm sure there will be someone at the weeding that she can dance with.", "NTA. I would tell her she can bring her kids OR a plus one. Let her choose. You win either way.", "NTA. I think you're being VERY generous allowing her FOUR CHILDREN to attend...and she had the nerve to ask for an additional person??  Wow.  She's a bit of a choosy beggar, isn't she?", "NTA. If she is taking her kids with her, who she is expecting to watch them when she dances?", "NTA.  She will be there with her 4 kids and her whole family, she doesn\u2019t need to bring some rando to keep her company.", "NTA\n\nHell it's not even just your rules (which would be enough on their own), if the venue has a cap it has a cap, fire codes don't care how old each occupant is.", "NTA. If she had a serious partner, that's one thing.  But she doesn't, so she doesn't need to bring a rando to your wedding.  She had 4 kids to keep an eye on, she'll be occupied lol", "NTA.  I don't even know where your mom gets off on saying \"that's what you do for adults.\"  You're not obligated to give anyone a +1 regardless of their age.  If your sister wants to dance with someone at the wedding, she can socialize with the other guests because that's what adults do.", "NTA\nI\u2019ve been on both sides of this. 1) It\u2019s not like you are telling her no plus one because you dislike her partner or similar. If no serious partner, shouldn\u2019t insist and doesn\u2019t matter who you are. As long as the rule applies for everyone, then it\u2019s fine. 2) limited guest caps are real and it\u2019s your wedding and your guest list and your money being spent.", "So if she brings a plus one, as well as the kids, then I have to ask...who the hell is going to be watching the kids? NTA.", "NTA It's really cute that she wants to wine and dine someone at your expense. A person you have never met and that she is not in a relationship with. I think that the wedding is about you and your future husband and should include people that you want to share the occasion with. If your sister can't have a good time without a date, then she should pay in advance for her date to attend. The wedding and reception are about the married couple after all. Who does she expect to babysit her children while she is dancing anyway? Are other people going to forgo the dancing and babysit so she can have a good time?\n\nSince you have limitations on how many guests you can invite and don't seem to have the extra money to spend, I think you are being reasonable.", "NTA. Your wedding, you get to decide. \n\nIf your mum wants to cave to her then your mum can pay the additional cost. Also I get the impression your sister may ramp it up and turn around and say she won't come if she doesn't get a plus one, do be prepared for that.", "NTA\n\n4 kids is more then a plus one", "NTA. Tell her she gets either to bring her kids OR get a +1. Not both. Her choice.", "NTA- but sis is ! Does she not get how much $$ this is costing?", "NTA \n\nEven if she did bring a +1 it doesn't sound like she really has good judgement in guys to bring someone you'd want around. Plus, if you give her a +1 how much time would she spend looking after her current +4 she's already bringing? Plus no one else is getting a +1 so it's not like you are singling her out for any reason.", "NTA.  She asked you answered.  Hold firm.", "NTA \n\nTell her if she really wants it then she can give you the money for it, your already paying so much for just her and her kids.", "NTA. You already caved to have the kids - she either gets a plus one or the kids. End of story", "NTA she isn't in a relationship.   She has family there she doesn't need to bring a random date \n\nThe only way I would give her a plus one is if she was already in a serious relationship when the invites came out", "NTA. You have a hard limit on the number of guests and have invited the people that are most important. I could maybe understand her being upset if she had been seeing someone seriously for a year or two or longer, but its a pretty normal thing for people not to get a plus one when they arent actually seeing someone seriously.", "NTA.", "NTA. She can dance with her 4 kids.", "NTA it seems like there\u2019s already been so much drama you\u2019ve been forced to cater to her needs just to keep the peace. Give her an inch and she tries to take a mile!!! Remind her that you\u2019re doing her a favour by not having your desired childfree wedding for her sake and that\u2019s where your charity on YOUR special day ends because this day is not about her.", "Info\n\nIn my culture, it's normal for the guest to gift money that is equal or greater than the cost for them to attend the wedding.\n\nFor example, if I came, I'd have to gift you $150. Which is $100 for cost of my meal + $50 as an actual gift. \n\nIs your sister paying this as well? I don't see a problem if she's gifting you $150 x 6 humans = $900 total. You'd get the $600 you spent on her back anyways.", "NTA, its YOUR wedding and honestly at that point I would tell her not to come at all. She sounds like a lot of drama and stress on a day that is supposed to be about you & celebrating your love for your spouse. Set boundaries and stick to them, and don't let anyone else manipulate you into giving in. The sister isn't ever gonna be happy, and will keep demanding more. So no more. As it is, it sounds like you *wanted* a childfree wedding and had to forego that specifically because of her. No. Its not her day, its not about her, and she isnt paying for anything. \n\nPersonally I would uninvite her & her kids entirely. Boundaries are hard but they exist for a reason. Stop stressing so much and focus on enjoying your special day.", "NTA. The day is not about her, and it's very sweet that you went out of your way to make sure your nieces and nephews are there. Explain that you had to bump a number of people off your guest list already to make sure your family is complete, ask her for some understanding. It sounds like she's touchy about being \"alone\" at a wedding because of her recent experiences, which is understandable.", "NTA, she\u2019s unreasonable and you shouldn\u2019t be expected to pay for a random person to attend your wedding.", "NTA.", "NTA", "Nope, NTA.\n\nShe isn't in a serious, committed relationship so why would you invite them? She's being entitled. I am sure your sister can dance with family and friends.", "NTA. It\u2019s not her day, or her money being spent.", "NTA, but those kids are pretty young, and you might find yourself extra irritated when she can't wrangle them all alone for the day", "INFO: Would her kids even eat the catering food? Legitimate question. I have a 4 year old that I know the catering would be wasted on. Depending on their age would it be possible to arrange another meal for them?", "If it\u2019s so important for her to have a date, suggest she pay for their cost. But regardless, I would special order those kids meals so you\u2019re not dropping $400 alone for young children. Expecting to be allowed to bring 4 KIDS and a guest at $100 a pop is cray. NTA", "NTA. What is this thing with people being unable to attend weddings unless they have someone with them? I\u2019ve gone to so many weddings on my own and had a great time. You presumably know at least one or two people at any wedding you\u2019re attending, and if she\u2019s your sister she knows a lot more, and it\u2019s not the end of the world to actually talk to some new people. Why do you need a \u201cplus one\u201d?", "OMG - NTA. If she doesn\u2019t want to come to your wedding without a date, she is welcome to stay home with her 4 spawn. Stand your ground!", "NTA \n\nTell her she can **either** have a plus 1 **or** her kids at the wedding. \n\nThat might give her some perspective. And if she does find someone to watch the kids and prefers to come with a date, maybe its for the better.", "NTA. Also, the reason some people like to bring a plus 1 is that they won't know anyone. Not the case for sister. Also,  who would be minding the 4 kids while she was with date? She can't just ignore whatever rando she drums up,  and it's not fair to pawn 4 kids off on other guests.", "She is 5% of the total guest list and **10% of your half** of the guest list.\n\nNTA", "Nta she has a +4!", "NTA, Your wedding your rules. Nothing else really matters.", "NTA, your wedding your choices. She should be grateful that her 4 kids are invited", "NTA", "NTA. When you have to count every single person, you have to keep your guest list short somehow. Not allowing any plus ones other than serious relationships is perfectly reasonable", "NTA.  Especially if you are shouldering the burden of wedding costs without help from parents.", "NTA", "NTA.  Stand your ground girl!", "NTA sounds like you should have stuck with the wedding being child free. People like her will always complain and want more, you should have the wedding you want instead of what others want and end up regretting it later.", "INFO: You don't seem to like her or her kids or want any of them there. Why are you inviting them at all?\n\nThis isn't really directly about being an AH, but if you've already invited her and her kids to keep the peace, then it seems like your options are either to let her have a +1 and save the hassle, or to accept that there's going to be massive drama anyway and cut her to save headcount. As it stands, you're getting like 70% of the drama of not inviting her *and* burning 83% of the headcount of letting her have a +1, which seems like the worst middle ground.", "INFO: does she have a \u201cplus-one\u201d she could bring not as a random date but as someone who can help wrangle her four young kids?

I\u2019ve danced more with friends than my husband at weddings we\u2019ve been too so I think that\u2019s a dumb reason to need a +1.

I honestly dont care about the gift thing but Im already paying roughly $500 for her and her family, and extra $100 just feels unreasonable given she already is bringing 4 extra guests  \nMy partner and I are paying for the entire wedding ourselves.", "She's gonna have four kids there- she should be busy corralling her kids!  As someone with a four year old I would expect at least 60% of my time at a wedding to be child wrangling.  Add three more kids and I can't see how she would have any time to spend with a date.  And who wants to go on a date with someone and their four kids?  Even if it was just a friend, I would read that as 'come to this wedding to help me with my kids'.", "Also agree on NTA. The Being An Adult excuse doesn\u2019t vibe with me either because I\u2019ve been in wedding parties before and didn\u2019t get a plus one because they were so strict with how many people were allowed to come. It is what it is.", "Good point.\n\nOP, tell your sister that she can have a) +1 or b) the kids, as the venue can't accommodate more than that.", "Really.  Leave the youngest two with a sitter, at least.  She wants to enjoy the wedding or spend most of the time watching after kids as young as 4?", ">or my favorite, STFU.\n\nI'm stealing that lol", "This is a great idea, but, I have a sneaking suspicion that if she is given this option, she\u2019ll just show up with the kids and plus 1.\n\nSeems the type to make a scene and try to put all the attention on herself.", "This is the smart play, fair, and good strategy.", "I've never been someone's wedding date when they brought their kids with them. That sounds terrible.", "Not a bad idea", "Exactly, with the youngest of the children being only four.  An age where they won't remember much if anything about the wedding and where they're more likely to have a meltdown over something.  I wouldn't blame OP at all if they only allowed the 11-year-old to come.  For sister to still whine that what she's been given isn't good enough is mind-blowing.", "[removed]", "It is generous to allow blood related family to join a wedding?\nI also find the +1 request ridiculous and unnecessary, but thr children are OPs nieces and nephews. If you don't invite family of that distance, you might as well marry without guests or just family and siblings...", "So this! Technically the plus one is the 4 yr old, since she'll have to be hands on the full event!", "[removed]", "Yes part of being a parent is that when your kids attend an event you take care of your own children and ensure they are having a good time. When you have kids you make sacrifices, you don't expect others to watch and entertain your children while you have a good time at someone else's expense. How much time could she have for a date with 4 children in tow?\n\nShe can get a babysitter and go out for dinner and dancing using her own money at another time.", "Right?  Ask her who on the guest list she wants you to leave off for her to be able to invite some random person.  You have a hard stop at 105, not 106", "Right? I\u2019ve been to plenty of weddings as an adult and never had a plus one. I somehow survived and had a decent time.", "Especially at a family wedding. I could see making an exception for someone who wouldn't know many of the other people at the wedding so they wouldn't be mostly alone but I'm assuming the sister will know plenty of the guests in addition to her parents and four children.", "No, even then, no. OP shouldn't have anyone at her wedding that she doesn't want.", "That would be the best, allows OP to invite 5 people who really do want to come.", "Thats considered pretty normal here as well. But no, she's broke and Im not expecting anything from her. I dont even care about that, I just dont want to spend even more money on her and to have a rando at our wedding in place of someone we'd actually know and like.", "Wanted to add - I worked weddings for a few years and they are very expensive. Spend the money on what matters. Also, hopefully she will be watching her 4 kids and not letting them run freely around a venue to get into trouble, which happens often at weddings. The day isn't about your guests, its about love between you/your spouse. Thats all that matters.", "We are not allowed outside food. The caterer has a kids meal option but its the same price. The older kids will likely eat the \"adult\" meal. The 4 and 7 year old will likely opt for the kids meal.", "We are not allowed to bring outside food. $100 a pop is absolutely cray but thats how weddings are..", "not a girl but thank you", "I\u2019m certain it\u2019s to keep the peace. I bet not having her at all would cause the families to fight etc, this seems like OP has been moving to avoid a bigger issue but I\u2019m reading between the lines and maybe I\u2019m not accurate", "I was wondering this too. The way OP keeps referring to them as her sister's kids and not her nieces and nephews is pretty telling. \n\nEither way though, I think NTA, cause I don't think anyone is entitled to a plus 1, especially if they are single.", "Seconded. If your goal is to avoid drama, then either go all the way or not at all.", "Why? It\u2019s their wedding, they don\u2019t want to pay. Sis can go or not go with the perimeters they have set out. As this sub likes to say \u201can invitation isn\u2019t a summons\u201d", "Only one person who is not in a serious relationship as a plus one. He is in the wedding party and coming in from out of town. We are also much much closer and him + plus one is less than half the cost of Mia and her kids. All other plus ones are at least living together if not married.", "If she was in a serious relationship or wasnt bringing 4 kids, it'd be a no brainer. As it is, we arent  close and Im already spending $500 on her and her kids to be there.", "What does their relation have to do with anything? Lol", "Then that\u2019s your answer. No means no and you shouldn\u2019t have to justify it to anyone. It\u2019s your wedding and your money. Don\u2019t let anyone bully you into doing something you don\u2019t want to do. Your sister will be fine without a plus one.", "Plus the size of the venue. Don\u2019t feel bad OP, your cash, your day, your way. Sister will get over it.", "Sometimes \"No\" is a perfectly fine complete sentence.\nAlso what does she plan on doing with her kids if she wants to spend the night/day with a random? Is she expecting your parents to watch her kids? In which case i would be telling her to stuff it", "Tell her you can barely afford her brood to be there, she will have to pay for the plus one if she wants one there, and that she is not entitled to spend any more of your money.", "You shouldn\u2019t have to omit a friend in order for her to have an unspecified date.  You have space issues and her limit is 5.", "10/10", "Why are you even inviting her? You clearly don't like her and consider her and her children to be a burden. Why not just be honest and tell her you don't want her there?  It's bizarre that you're this caught up on the cost of having your own nieces and nephews at your wedding.", "This was my thought- a partner to dance with? Honey you won\u2019t have time to dance unless you\u2019re planning on letting your kids run wild!", "Also the younger kids, and probably the older ones as well, will have a lot more fin at home than at the wedding", "I highly doubt she's planning to watch them at all.", "You have an invite for your and 4 (however many kids) if you can get a babysitter for the youngest or whatever then you can exchange that seat with a dance date. Otherwise I\u2019m sorry but we can\u2019t afford all that. I\u2019d love to accommodate you but I simply cannot here so you have to make a choice sis.\n\nNTA", "The 11-year-old would never forgive them for making them come while all their siblings got to have fun", "Exactly, who wants a complete rando at their wedding?!", "When it\u2019s a tiny venue with a limited guest list, and $100 a plate, yeah it is generous.", "Yes.", "No. Don't do this. Sister is oblivious and will give an insensitive, genuine answer that might cause even more issues. It doesn't matter who she wants univited.\n\nNTA, OP.", "Yeah agreed\u2026It\u2019s not just about not wanting to pay for another person it\u2019s that there wouldn\u2019t be room for another person at the wedding, even if they are paid for.", "I think I phrased it wrong, but agreed OP shouldn't have anyone she doesn't want there", "Absolutely... OP needs to stick to her guns and not fall for the blackmail", "Mmm... if her date will fork out $150 to come then I think it should be okay. But if not, then you're NTA for denying her request.\n\nUltimately it is your wedding. Therefore your rules. Go invite the friend you actually know and want at the wedding. Get a bouncer if you need to.", "$100 a pop as an overall cost is normal, for young children, cray cray. But if that\u2019s the rules, you should hold on to yours or compromise with sis on her paying for her guests ticket. Good luck!", "That's sort of my point, though; she has already given up a ton of ground and headcount by allowing the children to attend the wedding to keep the peace. At that point, making a stand about the +1 seems to be getting all of the drama and few of the rewards.", "NTA for not including +1s, but you mishandled your response & it sounds rude.\n\nHer kids are not her +1s. You are not giving out +1s. It\u2019s invited guests only due to venue limitations.\n\nAlso, not sure your venue, but kids are often cheaper b/c they don\u2019t drink, eat kids meals (so you may want to check).", "YTA - You think inviting your nieces and nephews to your wedding is a great favor to their mom, you clearly would prefer your own relatives not be there and you clearly don't have a lot of respect for your sister. \n\nWhy not just be honest and let her know that her and her family aren't important to you and you would prefer to spend the money elsewhere?", "But other guests are undoubtedly going to bring dates from non serious relationships.", "Why don\u2019t you just not invite her or her kids if it\u2019s about money", "...\n\n...\n\nWhat", "Everything? It's family, something you'll have almost forever.", "Or - tell her she can have a plus one if she leaves one of her kids at home.  Your guest list is at the max, and there isn't any room or money for anyone else.", "Since the sister is broke that\u2019s a way to get sister ti back off.", "It sounds like OP wanted to have a child-free wedding, but maybe sister pushed to have her kids there, which is part of OP\u2019s resentment about sister now also pushing to have a plus one. I think OP DOES want their sister there, or at least wants to avoid the probably nuclear family drama of not inviting her, but is tired of her continually pushing to take up more space on the limited guest list.", "Yeah\u2026 maybe she just finally had enough and decided to dig her heels in at this point. Maybe didn\u2019t believe it would go this far when she started giving leeway. The audacity surprises me, at least\u2026 I\u2019d never have expected a wedding guest behave that way but I keep having to remind myself that some people are just nuts who shouldn\u2019t be given any leeway in the first place. Hindsight I guess\u2026", "Who else would including 4 kids be a favor to? Also there's the hard cap of the guest list. A rando there for her is one less person we know and like that can be there.", "It\u2019s a child free wedding. She\u2019s already going against what she wants to accommodate her sister.", ">Why not just be honest and let her know that her and her family aren't important to you and you would prefer to spend the money elsewhere?\n\nSo your reasoning is that her and her family isn't important because OP doesn't want to let her bring a random person that isn't part of her family. Can you explain how that makes sense?", "Yes but they probably are not bringing four kids with them.", "She\u2019s bringing 4 kids! I think she\u2019ll be okay! NTA OP", "Only one person was given a plus one who does not live with their partner. That person is coming in from out of town and in the wedding party. All other plus ones are serious partners.", "family isn\u2019t always #1 priority. Nor do they have to be the most important thing ever. \n\nSome friends are more important than family for some people and that\u2019s honestly perfectly fine.", "The kids are family. I wouldn't give her the opportunity to leave a family member at home in favor of a new fling. Especially since only 1 kid would be left out.", "One\u2026I was thinking all. All 4 kids stay home and she can bring a date I think is very reasonable \ud83d\ude02", "Honestly, I don't really think the sister of the bride, already bringing her four kids along, asking about a +1 is that audacious. The bride is free to decline, but yeah, as far as drama goes \"not allowing your nuclear family to bring a +1\" is pretty much guaranteed to start it and a sibling assuming they have a +1 is not that odd. The biggest issue here is just that AITA's very \"do you have the right to do X\" morality doesn't really work well when the actual question is \"how many seats at your wedding would you trade to avoid drama\", or any question about keeping the peace, really.", "That was what I was thinking. She bringing a new boyfriend or a friend with her will also mean that someone (family member or a friend of the couple) will be out of the guest list due to the small venue", "I suppose if she does not realize how much extra her (reluctantly invited) kids have already cost the OP then she might not realize how much more she is asking of her\u2026 but I\u2019d think if sisters were to be making personal sacrifices and allowances for one another the sister who is a guest to the wedding should defer to the bride. \n\nIn any case, I\u2019m just glad it isn\u2019t my problem! Cause you\u2019re right, at the end of the day it isn\u2019t about the guest list itself so much as the cost and everything else behind the decision. Which is above my pay grade lol", "I think the idea is that it feels like an unreasonable request so she'd shut up and just bring her kids. But I don't think it's necessary to even offer that \"compromise.\"\n\nI mean, maybe she could leave her 4 kids at home and bring a random instead, but she currently lives with their parents so that would undoubtedly cause drama over babysitting instead."]}
