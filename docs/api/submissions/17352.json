I am a 32(F) husband is 33(M) and an only child. \n\nMy mother in law (~63F) purchased a house over 3 years ago and was going to redo it, put additions on, etc. and move into it. By the time she secured the plans and a contractor, plus got the permits, rates increased too high for her to do what she wanted. She opted to just remodel the house for now with cash on hand and her plan was to rent it out until she could afford the additions to move in. \n\nAbout 6 months ago she approached my husband and I and asked us to buy the house from her for a \u201cfamily price\u201d because she couldn\u2019t do what she wanted and her husband (who she didn\u2019t consult with before buying the property) was not agreeing to move and downsize from their current house. Ultimately she proposed a price of $375k. My husband and I agreed and even helped make some decisions about the house while it was being remodeled, including putting about $8k of our own money into improvements (we know now how dumb this was). Construction on the house is just about wrapped up, so we\u2019ve proceeded to get a contract out together, contacted an agent to list our house, and we\u2019re working on securing a loan for $375k as agreed upon. During this time she\u2019s mentioned multiple times how this is essentially an early inheritance for my husband, so she can be alive to see him enjoy the home. \n\nThings were going great until she dropped a bomb on us this morning (in an email to the person drafting the contract) that she wants to add a contract addendum stating if we were to sell in the future she would get first right of refusal and the property would be sold to her for 35% under market value. This SHOCKED my husband and I because she never mentioned this at all during the 6+ month process, and now we\u2019re about 1.5 months from actually purchasing. \n\nFor reference she is giving us a very good price for the house BUT we never asked her to. We also never asked if we could buy the house, she asked us to because she wanted it to stay in the family and she realized it wasn\u2019t in the cards for her. She estimates the house would sell for $500k (I personally think that\u2019s a bit of a stretch) so she\u2019s giving us about a 25% discount\u2026 but expects us to give her a 35% discount if we were to sell in the future. \n\nWe also purchased a property from her 2 years ago for $225k.. she originally told us the price would be $200k but changed her mind last minute and upped it. We paid almost fair market value for the house, it appraised at $230k. \n\nWe told her we\u2019re not comfortable with this since she wasn\u2019t honest/upfront about this clause from the beginning and we aren\u2019t in a financial position to give up 35% of our homes value in the future. She thinks we\u2019re not being understanding of her situation and the \u201cblood, sweat and tears\u201d she put into the place. \n\nSo, AITA for being unwilling to accept this last minute contingency and backing out of the deal? This whole thing feels deceitful and I think it will forever feel like we\u2019re living in \u201cher house.\u201d", "created_utc": 1684181776, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ij4c0/aita_for_not_agreeing_to_mils_contract_addendum/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I mentioned multiple times I thought this was a bad idea and wouldn\u2019t end up right. I guess he just wanted to believe the best about his mom.

Haha", "The first deal she switched up because we opted to go for financing through a mortgage company at a lower rate and 20% down vs. her holding the mortgage and wanting almost 50% down to clear her mortgage on the property.

Since we did that she had to pay the taxes immediately, so she upped the price to cover her capital gains. \n\nI hope he does too. \ud83e\udd74 At first I thought he was head strong about this but now he\u2019s wavering.  Good news is he won\u2019t opt to buy the house on his own and I won\u2019t sign the papers so I won\u2019t be on the hook anymore.", "No it definitely felt like you weren't as resolved as I now know you to be haha so sorry if I was aggressive", "Oh no not at all! I totally get the tough love/stern advice. I don\u2019t want to ruin our relationship with her, but I also can\u2019t ruin my financial future with this decision. She has 6 properties, we have only our primary residence.. so a 35% loss would be crazy"]}
