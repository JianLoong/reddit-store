I do something more in there wheel house. \n\n\nMaybe asking your gf to go for a walk or go to a public pool for a swim to be more active. Would have been better and fun date night.\n\nOr maybe trying out a new recipe that is used for meal planning  together.

Growing up from childhood, we are never taught to accept responsibility for anything we do wrong.

The most helpful thing you can do is support someone to help themselves, and I get what you did is sort of that but you jumped in way too fast. Psychologists hate this one small trick\u2026. Just ask.. do you want me to listen and understand or to provide a solution\u2026.. that\u2019s it. 95% of the time it\u2019s the listening that achieves the most.

If you weren\u2019t to do anything and just consoling her feelings, that\u2019s enabling her to still have bad habits and future health concerns. Which is probably why you wanted to help so badly. A high BMI as you know will cause problems in the future (obesity). Her mental health is probably causing these issues as she\u2019s not having effective coping mechanisms.

Here's what I do, any time someone complains, I suggest a small step towards solution. For your case, you can say \"hey, if you think you'd feel better loosing some weight, try going for a run every morning\". And leave it at that. If they take your advice, they really do want to change and will come back to you for further steps. I'd they don't, it was just a complaint and they don't want a solution. Works every time for me.", "Maybe unpopular opinion but NTA - if you date and live with a guy who minored in exercise science, worked as a personal trainer, goes to the gym all the time, and would love to do it together with you (not like she is not aware of those things), and you complain to him about being unhappy about your recent weight gain and how you can't wear your favorite clothes anymore and should stick to his meal choices and need to \"figure something out\" - OBVIOUSLY he is going to switch on personal trainer mode and come up with a plan for you !!! Because that's his thing !!! I am a woman and I find it incredibly whiney of any women in this situation to get offended. Or would it be equally \"offensive\" and \"mean\" if your medical doctor bf comes up with treatment ideas after you keep complaining about your health issues..? PROBABLY NOT.\n\nOf course there is always the possibility that people are lying on reddit and that this is not how things went down. I'd still say don't date and live with that kind of fitness/body goals guy if you can't deal with his approach to fitness and weight, but in that case he could be a bit of an ass, obviously.

She\u2019s repeatedly mentioned her discomfort to you; you made a productive suggestion to help her but she apparently doesn\u2019t want to change. Instead it sounds like she\u2019s fishing for compliments and validation. So maybe she wasn\u2019t being totally honest in the first place. You can\u2019t be expected to be a mind reader if people aren\u2019t straight up.  Next time ask first if they want your help so you don\u2019t waste your time and suffer someone\u2019s wrath.", "NAH, it's just a miscommunication that's really common when you're inclined to problem-solving. You thought she was asking for help, from her point of view she was probably looking for empathy, reassurance, and/or for someone to just listen. Give her a little bit of time, apologize and tell her that you misunderstood.", "NAH but I\u2019m prepared to get downvoted lol \n\nMultiple times, you supported her and reassured her and she kept repeating her behaviour so, naturally, you looked for a different solution. \n\nNgl I don\u2019t think you\u2019re that much of an AH.

You should have let her be apart of it, let her set her own boundaries and have your knowledge and her feelings work together instead of having it be one sided.

You did a classic guy thing (sorry to very guy that dont fo it, but it is common), instead listening to her and comfort you went and ovetstepped. You decided to find a solution to a problem, she had not said it was  problem yet but you confirmed it was since you had to go get a solution.  \n\nKey word is \"felt\", she didnt say \"is\" fat, but \"felt\" fat.

She wanted you to listen and empathise not solve. You were totally insensitive to her and validated her feelings of being fat and her insecurities. Also if you are honest with yourself the plan wasn\u2019t about her it was about you. You wanted your girlfriend to exercise with you and be excited about it, so when was feeling low you pushed your plan on her.", "Lol\n\nClassic blunder.\n\nShe just wanted your emotional support. Not a detailed regimen on how to fix herself.\n\nMaybe next time just *listen*.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to solve her problems for her. You can ask if she wants help, but if she doesn\u2019t respond positively, don\u2019t press the issue. But you came out the gate with a full plan that you spent *hours* putting together. Can you see why this might be upsetting to her?", "NTA\n\nYou tell her she's beautiful and she's not fat and you were listening to her problems. Sometimes we do things for the people we care about without them asking, it's called caring about that person. The way she reacted (accusing and yelling) to your gesture was not right.\n\nyou're gf needs to communicate things better, if she didn't want your help and just wanted you to listen, she should've said that, and the way she reacted was very immature.", "A helpful thing to ask if you're not sure is, \"are you looking for comfort,  solutions, or both? I'm here to help however is best for you\"", "Oh Jesus shut up. His girlfriend needs to man the fuck up. Any man in this situation would ostracized and hung at the stake. She\u2019s fat. He gave a solution after giving her support, which is again more support.", "Oh, come on, he was more that comforting and reassuring her that she is fine. She did the step further by mentioning she should do something about it. This is a great thing that he did, it is clear that he put effort on it, he wasn't just making comments about her weight gain. Gosh, this thing would have cost her a lot of $$, if she was consulting a personal trainer. \nHe is not T A but neither is she,  I think her insecurities talked and not her.\nHope they can talk this through and figure things out, cause this will benefit her a lot. A healthy diet, exercise and emotional and physical support from SO, her confidence and well being will be skyrocketing.", "I would bet dollars to donuts that she has NEVER used the word \"sexy tiktok gym girls\"", "Just to add.. I'm assuming she knows his educational background. \n\nThe way he wrote was she said SHE needed to make some changes. Never asking specifically for his help, even knowing his background. More of an \"I'm going to follow your lead for awhile\", not an \"make a whole routine and be my personal trainer\"", "Spot on", "\u201cI love the way you are, but here\u2019s how I can support you to make the changes you want to make\u201d is how it was meant.", "I agree with this. \"I'm fat & I'm unhappy about it but that doesn't mean YOU'RE allowed to think I'm fat & unhappy!\"", ">YTA go find some gym whire that'll make you happy instead of trying to change someone for no reason\n\nbut OP's gf is insecure about their weight? Its almost like there is a solution to that. Not condoning all the lengths OP went through, especially without talking to her first but come on \"for no reason\"?", "Asking \"need help or an ear?\" Is a good advice. \nDepending on the day, and this is just me personally. \nIf you caught me on a day where my mood was feeling low, I would feel sad and not see my partner meant well with something like this.\nBut catch me on a good day, I would have been excited that they would want to work out with me and help me reach that goal that's inside my head.", "Came to say this.", "But also - maybe women need to be better at communicating because a lot of these AITA are \u201cwoman complains about problem - man tries to solve and is asshole\u201d or \u201cwoman gives unclear response - man is asshole for not interpreting correctly\u201d.", "No doubt. What matters is how it was received.", "If she didn\u2019t ASK for him to do something about it, he doesn\u2019t need to take it upon himself to \u201cfix\u201d the problem. Partners feel comfortable venting/complaining/voicing things they wouldn\u2019t to others, doesn\u2019t mean they are hinting at you to do something for them. It\u2019s not a \u201cwomen need to be better at communicating\u201d issue, it\u2019s just a men just need to listen and not act on what they think someone wants.", "But she did communicate well. She said she had a problem that SHE needed to figure out. Then he went overboard to create likely a much more intense change than she wanted. And besides, she told him she wanted to fix it herself.", "This! \n\nEven if OP still wanted to help her he should have included her! He could have easily said, \u201cI could help you develop a plan and a diet based on what you want to fix.\u201d Instead he spent 6 hours developing plans for her and *her* body without any input at all. And although he wasn\u2019t necessarily enthusiastic about her actually changing, but more so the project itself, he sounded giddy as hell about it.\n\nImagine complaining about your butt and then your boyfriend coming up with a 3 month workout plan so you can have a \u201cbubble but like the TikTok girlies.\u201d"]}
