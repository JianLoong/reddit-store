I do something more in there wheel house. \n\n\nMaybe asking your gf to go for a walk or go to a public pool for a swim to be more active. Would have been better and fun date night.\n\nOr maybe trying out a new recipe that is used for meal planning  together.

Growing up from childhood, we are never taught to accept responsibility for anything we do wrong.

The most helpful thing you can do is support someone to help themselves, and I get what you did is sort of that but you jumped in way too fast. Psychologists hate this one small trick\u2026. Just ask.. do you want me to listen and understand or to provide a solution\u2026.. that\u2019s it. 95% of the time it\u2019s the listening that achieves the most.

If you weren\u2019t to do anything and just consoling her feelings, that\u2019s enabling her to still have bad habits and future health concerns. Which is probably why you wanted to help so badly. A high BMI as you know will cause problems in the future (obesity). Her mental health is probably causing these issues as she\u2019s not having effective coping mechanisms.

Here's what I do, any time someone complains, I suggest a small step towards solution. For your case, you can say \"hey, if you think you'd feel better loosing some weight, try going for a run every morning\". And leave it at that. If they take your advice, they really do want to change and will come back to you for further steps. I'd they don't, it was just a complaint and they don't want a solution. Works every time for me.", "Maybe unpopular opinion but NTA - if you date and live with a guy who minored in exercise science, worked as a personal trainer, goes to the gym all the time, and would love to do it together with you (not like she is not aware of those things), and you complain to him about being unhappy about your recent weight gain and how you can't wear your favorite clothes anymore and should stick to his meal choices and need to \"figure something out\" - OBVIOUSLY he is going to switch on personal trainer mode and come up with a plan for you !!! Because that's his thing !!! I am a woman and I find it incredibly whiney of any women in this situation to get offended. Or would it be equally \"offensive\" and \"mean\" if your medical doctor bf comes up with treatment ideas after you keep complaining about your health issues..? PROBABLY NOT.\n\nOf course there is always the possibility that people are lying on reddit and that this is not how things went down. I'd still say don't date and live with that kind of fitness/body goals guy if you can't deal with his approach to fitness and weight, but in that case he could be a bit of an ass, obviously.

She\u2019s repeatedly mentioned her discomfort to you; you made a productive suggestion to help her but she apparently doesn\u2019t want to change. Instead it sounds like she\u2019s fishing for compliments and validation. So maybe she wasn\u2019t being totally honest in the first place. You can\u2019t be expected to be a mind reader if people aren\u2019t straight up.  Next time ask first if they want your help so you don\u2019t waste your time and suffer someone\u2019s wrath.", "NAH, it's just a miscommunication that's really common when you're inclined to problem-solving.

Give her a little bit of time, apologize and tell her that you misunderstood.", "NAH but I\u2019m prepared to get downvoted lol \n\nMultiple times, you supported her and reassured her and she kept repeating her behaviour so, naturally, you looked for a different solution. \n\nNgl I don\u2019t think you\u2019re that much of an AH.

You should have let her be apart of it, let her set her own boundaries and have your knowledge and her feelings work together instead of having it be one sided.

You did a classic guy thing (sorry to very guy that dont fo it, but it is common), instead listening to her and comfort you went and ovetstepped.

She wanted you to listen and empathise not solve. You were totally insensitive to her and validated her feelings of being fat and her insecurities. Also if you are honest with yourself the plan wasn\u2019t about her it was about you. You wanted your girlfriend to exercise with you and be excited about it, so when was feeling low you pushed your plan on her.", "Lol\n\nClassic blunder.\n\nShe just wanted your emotional support.

Can you see why this might be upsetting to her?", "Gonna go against the grain here, NTA. \n\nYou tell her she's beautiful and she's not fat and you were listening to her problems. Sometimes we do things for the people we care about without them asking, it's called caring about that person.

She did the step further by mentioning she should do something about it. This is a great thing that he did, it is clear that he put effort on it, he wasn't just making comments about her weight gain. Gosh, this thing would have cost her a lot of $$, if she was consulting a personal trainer. \nHe is not T A but neither is she,  I think her insecurities talked and not her.\nHope they can talk this through and figure things out, cause this will benefit her a lot.

However before jumping in to being her personal trainer, maybe asking her if that\u2019s something she\u2019s interested in would\u2019ve been the first step", "NTA.. You were honestly just trying to help her after she'd shown interest. I can understand the mixed signal you got and thought she was ready to change and start actively working on something to better her health. Of course you were excited. From your perspective she was showing interest in your lifestyle and you want to share that with her, it's your dream. Can't be mad at you for just trying to help and support her and can't be mad at you for thinking she was wanting your help when it seemed like she was! I don't think you're an AH at all. I think you're a very loving, caring partner that was excited to share something he loves with his girlfriend who seemed like she wanted to actually do something about her issue. You've told her you love her and that she looks great. I don't know what else you could have done. You have her support and reassurance and have even gone so far as to spend 6 hours on a detailed plan to help her achieve everything you've paid attention to her mentioning. You pay attention to her. You're amazing! She's lucky to have you, man. I think she needs to understand things from your perspective, because she gave you all the signs that she was wanting help. Otherwise I don't think you'd have honestly done that, because you don't seem like the type to want to hurt your girlfriend. You seem very thoughtful and sweet. Keep doing you. If she does not appreciate it, some other woman will. \n\nAnd honestly, send that program to me! I could stand to lose weight and if she's not going to use it, at least someone could benefit from it! I want a booty! \ud83e\udd23", "Gentle YTA to NAH. Your gf commented multiple times that she felt bad about herself and you tried to reassure her *multiple times* something a lot of posts here seem to have missed. She\u2019s apparently already wanting to make some changes as she\u2019s literally said so after checking her weight, and she\u2019s already changing her eating habits to have what you have when you go out thereby taking your lead. So I can totally see how you got excited and ended up here with the best of intentions. But you see, you didn\u2019t ask, and you really should have done. Even if she *does* want to make changes, she might not want to go through that process *with you*. \n\nAnd here is where the concern is that you might have been a little bit of the AH - you say right at the start that you would love for the two of you to be a gym-buddy couple, and probably have a little fantasy about the two of you showing off your routines and her brand new \u201cbubble butt\u201d on TikTok and Instagram. Therefore you jumped at this chance. But here\u2019s the thing; she doesn\u2019t seem to want that! So honestly, if you want to be with her, and you do sound like you care about her, drop that. It\u2019s not her. \n\nSo, apologies in order, listen to her boundaries and back up, and think about how you can support her in *what she wants to do* rather than what you would like her to do. Good luck.", "I'll go with NAH. You gave her a solution when she wanted to be comforted. I'd feel hurt if boyfriend spent an entire evening to find the best way for me to change my body even if it's with good intent. \n\nWhat you could say in this situation is either \"do you want comfort or solution ?\" (But i don't feel like it's very nice\" or \"i don't feel like your fat, and you're still as pretty. However, if it do bother you, we might try to exercice together ?\". If she had say \"yes\" then you can make your diet plan and sport programm wich is very nice. And if she says no, then you ask how you could make her feel better", "I'm going to buck the trend and say NTA. As a woman, I'm so sick of the double standard - we want men to be open and honest and say what they mean, but don't hold ourselves to the same regard. What she said was \"I need to make a change\". When you told her she didn't need to, she doubled down. So you spent a long time crafting a very thoughtful gift. You heard her words but chose to take them at face value. \n\nI'm very insecure about my appearance but when I tell my husband that, he tells me he loves me for how I am but can he do anything to help me achieve my goals because he's very active. He's on the spectrum, so I'm careful to say what I mean instead of expecting him to guess how I truly feel. \n\nNext time, you might re-emphasise that you love how she looks, but ask her would she like you to make her a training regime. But no, NTA.", "NTA but came off as being one. I by no means have anywhere near the qualifications you have in this field. But I have but I some time figuring out a couple things that generally work for me when it comes to my weight and physicality. My wife has had the same struggles with her self image and has put me in similar situations and I made the same mistakes you did..... A few times. My best advice for a situation like this where you need to determine what someone wants in a conversation like this is to ask \"what do you plan on doing about it\". Sometimes you will get an answer that shows the person has a plan and just wants to vent or they will say that they don't know what to do. In the latter case you can then hit them with the \"would you like some suggestions?\". I am pretty sure these tactics are the only reason I am still married.\n\nNow to touch on some other comments I saw where people mentioned how hard it can be to have to listen to someone voice a complaint consistently while having the ability to manage the problem at hand themselves. This can be a tricky situation because it could be a matter of someone not being that bothered by something throughout the day, only actively thinking about it when directly met with the issue. Such as looking in the mirror and trying on clothes. If that is the case you don't want to be to harsh with your response because it may come off as you having a problem with it and trying to force a change. Ask me how I know. Though if this behavior goes on for a while and is becoming very regular you can try the line \"so what are YOU going to do about it\". If they don't know then offer help.\n\nThese are all things I have dealt with in my marriage and have been working through since and it is a great time being there for my wife and helping her see herself the way I do. No matter what you do you have to stay loving and supportive and you just might come out alive.", "Am interested in the plan you created", "NTA and shame on the people here for saying so. You did a great thing and she\u2019s lucky to have someone as proactive as you.", "NTA\nSounds like you\u2019re looking after you both, she seems to be fixated on TikTok and Instagram girls and that\u2019s bad because those \u201cinfluencers\u201d don\u2019t care about their followers, they just want the money. You give a shit about your GF and are trying to help her. \n\nWomen do this kind of thing a lot, my wife does it as well. She tells me she wants to lose weight, so we play our sports and eat less but she snacks when feeling bad. \nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole, I think she mistook the message of care you were offering\nIf she really wants to change she will but get her off of TikTok and IG, those social media sites are painful at best and  are super unhealthy to people with body dysforia.", "I will say though I hope you have learned to ask for clarification of what she wants in the future,  I will say NTA. This is like complaining to a structural engineer \"I designed a bridge, and it keeps collapsing. \" \"Oh, well I'm an engineer,  here's where your mistakes are.\" \"NO! You are supposed to just tell me how awesome my bridge is anyways despite it collapsing! I don't actually want to solve my problem. That's too much work!\"", "NTA because if this happened to me I would be thrilled and happy my partner was super concerned and wanted to give me this kind of solution without being asked. But I\u2019m a guy. LOL.\n\nI don\u2019t want to say it's boy vs girl kind of thing but I observe usually if a girl complains about something it\u2019s almost always just a rant (i.e., looking for someone to hear). So the better way to do this was to confirm to her first whether she wanted help or she just wanted an ear. But then again there are also cases where complaints were made and she was hoping for a solution, not an ear so that\u2019s where you need to navigate and distinguish which is which. Hope you\u2019ll recover from this one.", "NTA I think it was really sweet and it's nice that you are excited to share a part of yourself and a new interest with her. Hope she comes round to the idea. Good luck", "Poor dude. It's a lesson we all have to learn.\n\nBasically, your partner doesn't want you to fix her problems even if you can. She just wants to tell you about them and for you to comfort her.\n\nDoesn't make sense. Just accept it.", "NTA on intent but bro your communication skills leave much much much to be desired. You could have said (when she brings it up again) \u201chey if this bothers you so much, would you like me to build you a fitness and diet plan so you can have some control of it back?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s about accurately portraying your intent. By just building everything without her input you\u2019ve taken the control away from her - and it wasn\u2019t your intent at all", "nta. \n\nto be fair, as a woman i would've gone into the 'try this' mode like op. i personally don't understand why would anyone complain they're fat and feeling ugly but when given any suggestions, get upset. also, op also seems to comforted her that she isn't fat and she's good the way she is so idk, i think op really means well but she probably took it as confirmation to her insecurities... which she clearly needs to work on. \n\nmy advice is next time when someone's telling you something, ask them what they want. a solution, a third perspective, or a person to shut up and listen to their rant or trauma dumped on. it has helped me quite a lot lol cos i'm always 'here's the solution' type of person.", "Ive seen all the YTA replies, but im kinda leaning towards NTA.

OP was supportive saying that she's fine the way she is but for weeks she persisted that it was a problem for her, not for him. He doesn't really care about her weight gain but she does.

I know a lot of people are saying that YTA, but eh. I think there was a better approach that could have been done but what you did was out of love. My only recommendation is to ask her next time before diving into it. I am a Personal Trainer myself (side hustle) but nothing drives me crazier than 1) people complaining but doing nothing about it 2) the person not realizing that eating healthy and being active is soooo beneficial for their mental health, physical is just the added benefit imo.", "NTA , I can't see a problem with actively trying to solve something instead of just talking.", "If she does not want the help, she needs to stop complaining. I don\u2019t think anybody here is The Asshole, but she\u2019s got some insecurities she really needs to find a constructive way to deal with instead of lashing out when somebody has been listening to her complain for a solid week and then does something to try to help her.", "NTA. When she came looking for comfort and support you told her everything was fine several times, but she insisted that it is something that is affecting her and wanted something done about it knowing perfectly fine that you have an education and experience in that precise field. She is also an adult and needs to take responsibility for the way she communicates with you.\n\nYou want reassurance and support? You got it. You insist that it's a problem that needs fixing?

I got you bud.\n\nWomen don\u2019t want solutions, they want to vent. Never has a woman thought \u201cif I tell him, I want his advice.\u201d They want to get it off their chest.

I don't think so.\n\nEvidently OP expresses his love in acts of service and quality time. Even though I understand that someone's body image can be a touchy subject, she should've seen his actions as a way of support and encouragement. Especially after she's been voicing her unhappiness with her weight, and he continously reassured and comforted her for a significant amount of time. Sometimes people need comfort, but there comes a time, where you need to stop talking, and actually work on changing what's making you unhappy. He simply wanted to support her in starting the process.\n\nOP had literally not a single bad thought in his head, and his girlfriend should've been able to react in an appropriate way, even if the initial emotions she felt were negative. To me, it seems like she saw his present, immediately jumped to the conclusion that OP wants her to change, spiraled, and blew up on him. But her insecurities are not other people's responsibility.

I\u2019d say either nobody is TA here or everyone is: she didn\u2019t recognize a gift made of love and a passion of subject material but you probably should of asked what she wanted before diving in. \n\nThat being said, can I get a copy of that 90 day plan? Lol", "NTA. Maybe I'm in the minority but I don't think you're the asshole at all.\n\nI think shes feeling vulnerable right now so she took it to mean you want her to change.

But otherwise idk why the heck people are saying youre the asshole. Seems like a really nice thing to do for someone. Most people offer \"youre still hot honey dont worry\" and then do nothing further to help. You did a lot of work, and even if it was misguided or didn't \"land\", I strongly believe youre not the asshole.\n\nHowever, weight is a sensitive topic for guys and girls alike. Maybe try and give her a bit of a break on this one. She definitely shouldnt have called you and asshole (uncalled for). \n\nBut I think its just the kind of thing that time, as wel as many honest, supportive, healthy, loving conversations will fix. \n\nTechnically no one is wrong in this situation IMO.\n\nEdit: I used to have anorexia. I know its a very sensitive topic! But just because she took it as an insult doesn't make that true. We can feel valid, negative emotional reactions to things even when it's not an attack.

If you don\u2019t want to solve the problem then stop complaining about it, because the only person who deserves the complaint is yourself, not those around you. \n\nLike if I was insecure about my weight for example and I was talking to someone about it, I want advice, I want solutions. I don\u2019t want someone telling me that my problem isn\u2019t a problem and that I should just be comfortable with being uncomfortable, that only works until I look in the mirror or step on the scales the next day.\n\nI once was pretty close with a girl who always complained and wanted emotional support from me because she constantly felt like shit (as in physically and mentally). Her sleep schedule was awful, she drank like 3 energy drinks a day, ate more chocolate and sweets than actual food to the point where she would skip meals because she ate too much junk food, spent pretty much all day on social media and TikTok, and got addicted to those disposable vape things. I gave her as much emotional support as I could for about 6 months until I just couldn\u2019t do it anymore, I could only say the same thing so many times before I started feeling like I was the idiot in this situation for talking to a brick wall, because nothing was changing  and she was only getting worse. Eventually I decided to give her some actual advice, told her what she was doing wrong and how she could fix it, she just replied with \u201cdon\u2019t worry I\u2019ll be fine\u201d.

It's healthcare. And this is coming from someone who could absolutely use the 90 day plan you made. She took her insecurities out on you even though you were reassuring, gentle and helpful.", "NHA.

You said it\u2019s not a point of contention, but then went on to make a comment about how she \u201cdoesn\u2019t give it enough of a chance to see the fruits of her effort.\u201d This sounds like it could lead to resentment as an outsider. If she had accepted your 90 day plan, how would you have supported her if it was too much all at once? How you would have worked on making it a sustainable and enjoyable experience for her?

The GF is an adult and the amount of people in the comments treating her like a child is sad. She's projecting her insecurities onto you and it's wrong. You should explain why you did what you did.

I talk about this and thinks that this will help me with the things I feel worst about' and 'oh my god I was right to hate all those parts of me, he's obviously noticed how awful they are, too!!!') and found that hurtful.

Presenting her with a plan like that puts pressure and expectations on her and sets her up for potential failure and shame if she can't stick to it.", "Yeah it can honestly be exhausting someone constantly putting themselves down, no matter how much you reassure them. I don't blame OP for going you know what?

If she hates the gym, a gym based program isn\u2019t the best, most sustainable activity for her.

Dude probably got excited with the oportunity of sharing his interest with her.", "It was a week.  One week.  She didn't \"complain\", her self image and emotions took a hit.  \n\nThe hair on the back of my neck stands up whenever I hear \"so and so should be happy....\" or worse, \"grateful\".  Happy is an emotion, not a \"should\" and that phrase discounts the feelings of the person who isn't happy or grateful enough as judged by other people.  In this case, someone who doesn't know her at all.\n\nProbably comes from hearing things like, \"You should be grateful I take an interest in career and thank me for telling you when what you're doing wrong.\" Or, \"you should thank me for telling you your hair is too dry and that you should find a stylist.  Relax, you're too sensitive.\"\n\nRule of thumb, never offer unsolicited advice, EVER.  She did not ask him for advice on diet and exercise.  She managed her weight and diet just fine for years without advice.

Also look who she\u2019s complaining to - a fit guy who studied a bit of exercise science and worked as a physical trainer. He can totally be forgiven for thinking - after a week of constant complaining - that he was in a good position to help.\n\nThat matters because if he himself was out of shape or had zero expertise in health and fitness I\u2019d probably also take it badly. But when it\u2019s smack bang in his range?\n\nMy husbands in finance and if I was having financial issues and was constantly complaining about budgeting/tax/debt I wouldn\u2019t then blame him for being \u201cjudgemental\u201d for drawing me up a spreadsheet. \n\nI\u2019m going NTA", "I agree. If this has been an ongoing complaint from the girlfriend, for 1 , that is exhausting as a partner to hear someone complain about the same issue over and over but not take steps to change it. And 2, she knows what he does and has studied. Why wouldn't she think this is how he would help? This is how he helps people when they are unhappy with their weight.  She just got a very expensive gift. A personal fitness trainer and plan is not cheap. \n\nOn that not, he should have worked on the plan with her. When. People are upset with their weight gain, until they are ready to change, they will be upset with people who give unsolicited advice. Hopefully after she comes down from the initial shock, she will realize he was trying to be helpful. They both need to apologize.  \n\nOP. I would recommend saying you're sorry for not asking if she would like a personalized plan, and ask if she would like to sit down and work on it together.  If she doesn't,  then ask her how she would like to approach her weight gain. You've said it doesn't bother you, so does she want to go shopping and get some new clothes to help her feel better. I would also explain, that while it doesn't bother you, it's hard to see her so upset all the time so we need a solution.", "I think he should have asked her if she wanted his help since he knows a lot about it. She didn't ask for his help. She said SHE needed to figure something out. And yes, she is insecure, so she needs care and not necessarily him making this full programme for her.", "As a personal trainer bro should not only be capable of designing the \"technically perfect\" program and a diet plan but also comprehend that most people (especially if they dislike any physical activity) would find such a drasting change overwhelming and unsustainable. Too complicated and detailed program would make any new gym member flee...\n\nAs a fellow gym goer I get the enthusiasm but not everyone is passionate about best ways to target glutes or hamstrings (or whatever). And while an aspiring physique competitor probably has somewhat practical approach to dieting and discussing body composition, it does not seem the case of his gf (or most women for that matter). \n\nI think he's NTA (since good intentions) but should've been more considerate.", "She said *she* should do something about it. This is probably something that she feels ashamed or uncomfortable about so nobody should just jump to solve something she didn\u2019t ask for help solving. I don\u2019t think OP is TA, he really meant well, but it would\u2019ve been better to ask her if she wanted help.", ">So did she actually want to lose weight or did she want to whine about it forever?\n\nIdk about forever, but maybe she was in her feelings about it and needed to vent and get support? Not everyone jumps directly into solution mode, some people need to mull things over and develop courage and acceptance to start changing for the better. I'm a person like that, so me mentioning that I need to lose weight doesn't even require a response from anyone, it's just me slowly building up to a decision/solution.\n\nIf the other person feels awkward, they could say \"I think you look great, but what do you think you'd wanna change, then?\", because that lets them share more and talk about their goals and feelings on the matter, which could lead to the change they need. It's an internal process, but saying the things out loud/to another person can help.\n\nI don't think either of them is an AH, it was a misunderstanding and the wrong solution for someone who was already feeling sensitive.", "> Next time you want to help, sit down with your loved one, and ask how you can help.\n\nAlso it allows them to ease into it at a pace that's actually sustainable and not just something that will likely fizzle out. Habits are built slowly and especially for someone who has already mentioned disliking heavy exercise and such, should start small and work up not just try to run a marathon on day one.\n\nIt's like someone saying they want to get into lifting weights to their powerlifter partner, then they immediately rush at them with a 5 day starcream hypertophy schedule, with a detailed meal plan to make sure they're fed every 2 hours and getting at least 300g of protein very day.

She wanted to figure out why she was feeling insecure and gaining wait all of a sudden. That's her own journey.

He presented her with an option after having reassured her that she was ok and her weight wasn\u2019t an issue - and did this several times. \n\nHer insecurity has nothing to do with his attitude as he was supportive and reassuring- again, several times. \n\nInfantilizing people isn\u2019t a good way to see things, in my view. OPs girlfriend is an adult with her own free-will, cognition, judgment and decision-making skills and capacity. You were a kid listening to your mother because she was/ is your parent, a totally different rapport. \n\nPushing someone would be pestering them to go to the gym, criticising their food choices and reminding them they\u2019ve said they wanted to get healthier. OP did none of those.\n\nSince he is a professional in the field of fitness it\u2019s kind of expected that his plan would be of some intensity and properly put together, most people have to pay for that kind of product. That\u2019s not his \u201cexpectation\u201d, that\u2019s a set of tools he offered as part of the solution.", "Which is part of why it hurt - his plan reaffirmed her insecurities, told her she was right to think those parts weren\u2019t attractive and needed to change", "Honestly I think once she said that she needed 'to figure something out', that what OP did was fine. Op was trying to be helpful by making up a routine ect. \n\nClearly at this point it seemed like she was really looking to make a change. Sticking to eating what her bf ate for a week seems like a decent show of desire to change. She in no way needed to agree to do the diet or gym routine, but I do think she overreacted after it's been more or less what she's said she wants for a week. \n\nI'm a woman and I'd have been as confused as her bf by that point. If my friends had talked like that for a week I'd probably have moved on to offering solutions and plans on day 3.", "That is an excellent article. Thank you for posting it!", "He actually did!!\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve actually discussed this with him, he gave some very good pointers about how much time to allocate, what to focus on, tips and tricks, what I should begin with, etc. I really appreciated his interest and effort, and absolutely did not interpet it as \u201cpushing\u201d me. If I need help I\u2019ll ask for it, and we can always adjust the schedule structure to my work programme and daily routine. Very easy. Discussing is one thing, yelling and throwing fits is another one.", "If he can\u2019t handle that, this isn\u2019t the right relationship for him.", "Back in the 90s a relationship book based largely on this idea, Men are from Mars Women are from Venus, went absolutely viral.\n\nI disagree that it's a gender thing, though. It might be a tendency, but women can absolutely do this to their partner (or other people) too.", "It\u2019s not social clues, it\u2019s social cues. They\u2019re cues, not clues.", "im sorry, but take a look at what you are saying? \"to mold him into the image she wants\"\n\nhe literally says he likes her body. anyone who exercises knows its great for your mental health. he seems to have good intentions, yet you are painting him as a shallow guy who wants a fitness model for a girlfriend.\n\nhe could have asked, but that doesnt make him an asshole for not reading between the lines.\n\nstop trying to pain him as a bad guy, this isnt TwoX, there are no red flags.", "Just to be clear, I think that anyone who whines instead of seeking solutions is an idiot, regardless if they\u2019re male or female.", "Still not a gender issue, he\u2019s just more educated and experienced in fitness and wanted to help out (although he should have asked)", "My first thought was \"hmmm, I wonder if he'd share what he put together for her?\"!", "Yeah, I agree. Might be unpopular but NTA. She talked about it for a week and he did all the right things, comforted her & told her that he loves how she looks, etc. Only when she literally said that she \u201cneeds to figure something out\u201d because she feels fat did he make a fitness plan & recipe book.", "OP said she was eating the same food as him for a week and then he asked her about it.", "If he wasn\u2019t sure whether it was something she wanted, he could have asked.", "Also, she was complaining about her weight to her personal trainer boyfriend. What did she expect? It's a demonstration of love to what to help your partner, especially when you can use your expertise to do so.", "Seriously. He put in the better part of a work day putting something together to help directly fix the problem, and she instead of even looking at it, she chose to do nothing but lash out and continue wallowing in self pity.", "It's a natural masculine trait to come up with solutions to problems being presented, OP GF doesn't understand men.", "Obviously, she wouldn't. She's not capable of seeing it that way because she's too insecure and worried he thinks she's fat when he said repeatedly that's not the case.\n\nIf I bitched for a week that my back hurt and my chiropractor mate put together a plan to make me feel better, are they an AH too? Would it make sense for me to scream, call them an AH and run away because I never asked for that? \n\nMy guess is people's views are skewed here because this is about weight and OP's gf isn't the only one insecure about their weight.", "Exactely! I'm a woman too but I hate people who keep complaining about something that's fixable, that say they need \"figure something out\" and do nothing because complaining is better. GF sounds exausting tbh...", "If she can't handle him trying to help a problem she insists is real even when he reassures he continuously, this isn't the right relationship for her.", "He said he liked her body\u2026before providing her with a plan that took him six hours to make, all about how it can be better.\n\nTake a look at what HE\u2019S saying.  He\u2019s not waxing on about mental health and feeling better about herself, but about macros and TikTok bubble butts.\n\nI think his heart was in the right place.  His brain just didn\u2019t catch up in time.  \n\nHe\u2019s only 25.  As others have pointed out, this is a rookie mistake.  He\u2019s a soft YTA who will hopefully learn from this, not a walking red flag.", "I hope you\u2019re also schooling every comment here that accuses all women of whining and venting instead of being practical and solving problems.\n\nSince you say this isn\u2019t a gender issue.", "OP WE NEED THE DIET AND FITNESS PLAN STAT!!!!!!!\n\nSorry for shouting lol, but would really like to have a look and see if it\u2019s worth a try", "I literally thought that as well.", "Exactly.  That\u2019s an important element of this\u2026 he already did everything else first.", "This is a difference in interpretation.  I take it to mean the pattern of obsessing over her weight, you take it to mean the pattern of eating what he eats.  Or it could be both.  I\u2019m inclined to lean more towards the former (or both) because he talked to her because he was concerned.  He wouldn\u2019t be concerned about her just eating his food, he would probably be happy about it.", "I used to hear this constantly repeated by the men in group therapy who were court ordered to be there.", "Your chiropractor is someone you pay for a service. A significant other is not.", "Remind me again, was it him or her that came up with the idea of her losing weight? Like honestly if you\u2019re talking to someone who is into fitness about wanting to lose weight, why would you be shocked or offended when they go out of their way to help you? If you don\u2019t want to lose weight then why are you talking about wanting to lose weight? \n\nAnd when it comes to her butt, OP literally said it was something she was insecure about. It\u2019s not something he just threw int here because he wants a TikTok bubble butt girlfriend lol", "\"OP WE NEED THE DIET AND FITNESS PLAN STAT!!!\" Dumbledore asked calmly.", "LOL!", "I was really hoping he dropped it somewhere in the comments, lol", "Hey OP, are you listening?!", "What does this have to do with anything? Yeah male and female traits are also shared by the worst people in their gender, this doesn't automatically make the trait bad.", "My chiropractor mate means a significant other. It's a \"mate\" not a stranger. I guess it would be your choice if you pay your mate for services provoded in your relationship or not.", "I thought he was her boyfriend, not her personal trainer.\n\nSo, she\u2019s not allowed to talk about how she feels about her body, ever, without her bf spending six hours writing a textbook of how she can get a TikTok bubble butt?  \n\nSounds exhausting for both of them.  And less a romantic relationship than trainer-trainee.", "I don\u2019t have any Galleons to give you, so please accept my muggle gold\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47", "I\u2019m thinking would it be wrong to dm OP\u2026\u2026\u2026", "It\u2019s a bullshit excuse to avoid emotionally connecting with people.", "A boyfriend probably cares more about her well being than a personal trainer, no? She can talk about her body, but constantly complaining about being overweight is a little different. Again, OP tried reassuring her multiple times but she kept complaining so logically the next thing to try is an actual solution. Is he just meant to listen to her complaining and refuse to actually resolve the problem? \n\nIt\u2019s just so obvious, if you don\u2019t want your complaints to be resolved, then don\u2019t complain."]}
