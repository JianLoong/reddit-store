There's nothing wrong with asking for some concentrated attention.\n\nMaybe use kids as an analogy. What happens when you have multiple kids, but you don't spend focused time with them one on one? You the classic narratives all orbiting the concepts of \"I was never the priority,\" or \"x parent wasn't really around,\" or \"I didn't feel like x parent really cared about my feelings,\" etc etc etc.  \n\nThis isn't different for adults either. There are times where everyone wants to feel like they're being prioritized. Right now you don't feel that way, and that's a problem.\n\nNow from your husband's perspective, whether or not that's a problem may differ from his perspective; meaning whether or not time is really being committed to prioritizing you . You use in your example driving kids places together, sometimes that's going to be impractical given the responsibilities you both are carrying as heads of household. \n\nWhat I'm getting at here is that while you're feelings are valid, and you should feel prioritized; you may need to calibrate your expectations a bit vis-a-vis when that makes sense, and when it doesn't. Your husband probably has a few good points regarding what will and won't work for that, as do you. \n\nIf he does, that doesn't mean he gets to throw up his hands and say \"see I was right,\" because that set of feelings you're experiencing still need to be addressed; but it should certainly inform the conversation around how you two are actually going to solve the problem.", "I'm kind of like your husband in that the wife plans the activities and I'll occasionally veto something here or there based on logistics.\n\nWe do have multiple hobbies/interests were share and always make time for 1:1 time.

You need to communicate with him that while he is happy, you are growing discontent.", "NTA.\n\nPeople have identities beyond legal roles like \"wife/mother\" and \"husband/father\". You're still individuals. And when people forget that and become absorbed in their legal roles, they often breed resentment within themselves. You're just acutely aware it's happening.\n\nYou're not overreacting or being too sensitive or needy. You're an individual. And you want a relationship with your partner beyond the confines of the \"parent\" role. It's no different than loving your partner but wanting to enjoy time with your friends. What will he tell your kids when they start becoming more independent? \"We're a family, you don't need to hang out with anyone else?\"\n\nThis is also a long-term issue (especially since you became parents so early). When parents forget about their relationship with each other, it all falls apart when they become empty nesters. Relationships of ALL kinds take work, regardless of the other factors involved.

This sounds like the story of an old Motown song (that I can't remember) about needing to give the kids to grandma for the weekend and try one last time to save a relationship.  This is obvious where things are heading.  You might have to 'take command' of the logistics need to 'get him alone'.  Are the kids old enough to 'go to camp'?  If so, arrange for ALL of them to go to 'away camp' during spring break or summer/.  You need at least a week.  After that is planned, then work on yourself through self care activities.  After that, maybe arrange couple activities that he doesn't realize are couple activities.   Your friends or Reddit probably has ideas about what that would mean.", "NTA and it's important to remember that your relationship should exist without the kids. At some point they will leave and it will be the two of you. Will you enjoy that? Maintaining connection to your spouse involves more than just sex. If you have zero time together outside your kids and sex then you may find yourselves without much of a relationship.

That said, I hear two issues from you, one is that you never do things together and the other is that you are the only one to plan this.

Its not that they don't like each other anymore, but its always the same, both grew as ppl but not in the same direction, never did the effort to correct it (bc kids and blabla) and when the kids moved out they realised they grew so much apart, they don't love each other anymore romantically and don't even know each other anymore after 18+ years of cohabiting (with sex). \n\nI'm sorry for you and you should tell him you guys not being a real couple anymore but just a part of a family unit leads to your feelings towards him turning from romantic love to love you feel for a brother.

Manipulation, plain and simple.

If it was something he wanted to to (like a family dinner) he should be willing to plan it.\n\nI know if there's something I want to do with my GF I handle planning it, and don't expect her to handle it for me.", "Came here to post that same deal - this video explains it really well:\n\n[Tolerable Level of Permanent Unhappiness](https://youtu.be/CIu_R5NuxQM)", "\ud83d\ude02 this one caught me by surprise!", "I\u2019m sure he does a lot though and isn\u2019t interested in date night.  Maybe he\u2019s tired.  From her description he seems like a great guy but doesn\u2019t want to do a date night.  She does yet she wants him to also take on the burden of planning it.  It makes no sense.  He doesn\u2019t have the desire or motivation, why try to force him to plan it?  She needs to take the lead and make fun plans that he will enjoy.  If not, she can just keep complaining and letting it drive her crazy.  \n\nI truly don\u2019t understand your reasoning.  If you\u2019re happy not having sex with your husband, why would he ask you to step up and be sexy and initiate sex?  If he wants it, he needs to romance you.  The person that desires a behavior needs to drive it.  This is basic human behavior.  If person A wants something and person B doesn\u2019t.  Person A shouldn\u2019t tell person B to do all the work to make it happen.", "[removed]", "I did. On the day the divorce was granted,  it was as if a huge cloud of oppression lifted. By evening, I was a Hallmark  looking for announcements.  ( they had none, so I made my own, and mailed them.  I danced from the car to the post office...", "This just made me cry so much. I\u2019m so close to being there with my husband. I know his depression has a huge part to play and I try so hard to keep at it but I\u2019m so tired of asking for the same minimum of care and interest especially given he\u2019s the stay at home parent and I deal with fibromyalgia issues but he leaves me with all the homework and cleaning after a 12h day and when ever I dare complain he goes off the handle about how he never gets his way and always has to adapt to everyone. I never thought it was possible but I think his last meltdown I lost whatever love I had for him. I hope somehow, someway I can find it again. He\u2019s my best friend and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without him but I can\u2019t keep doing this either. Sorry \ud83d\ude22", "That's it!! Thanks @Big-BootyJudy", "Bad bot! Stolen from u/Sorry-Durian-9015", "I\u2019m really sorry you are going through this. We can only be there for those for so long and you would have no fault for doing what is best for you. I hope you all have more luck than my wife and I do. \u270c\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", ">I think his last meltdown I lost whatever love I had for him. I hope somehow, someway I can find it again.\n\nI had a moment like this with each of my parents. Where the relationship just snapped. My therapist said sometimes this happens when we realize that we simply cannot compromise with the person anymore. What they are asking for/demanding as necessary is beyond what you're willing to ever give and you just snap.\n\nI don't know how to come back from it without them acknowledging their demands are beyond unreasonable.  And they'll never do that.", "Is he doing anything to manage his depression though? If not, why are you tiptoeing around it? Depression will never get better unless someone actively tries to make it better. True depression is usually very treatable by antidepressants. The downside being, many people are misdiagnosed with depression. Many people actually have PTSD, and antidepressants don't do much for that. But there are treatments that are effective for trauma if people knew about them (EMDR, music therapy, somatic experiencing, internal family systems, are a few but always ask if the person is \"trauma informed\"). Unless he actually treats his depression, you will be stuck in this same loop until *you* break. He is being held up at the cost of your mental health. Have you told him that you need couples counseling? It sounds like him being a stay at home parent isn't working either, so maybe it's best if you both work. I typically don't like ultimatums, but these are the situations that call for them. Y'all need help, or you are doomed anyway. You also could use individual therapy to support you through this, but I understand his, yours, and together may be *expensive*.", "Thank you. I\u2019m so sorry I dumped my issues on you but it was just so\u2026. Idk how to say it. You\u2019re situation just hit home. I hope you find your happiness again.", "Oh we definitely all need therapy lol. We both have our fair share of acronyms, and PTSD is only one of them; his is worse from his time in the military. I\u2019m not one to tiptoe around anything and more like the bull in the China shop. I\u2019ve been asking him for years to go to therapy couples and/or alone but it\u2019s very looked down upon in his culture so he\u2019s refused or when he\u2019s gone (due to ultimatums) he doesn\u2019t talk and we fall right back into old patterns. He finally accepted about 9 months ago when I just lost it. COVID left me with some lifelong issues (fibro and heart) I went through it for a year but never stopped working because he flat out refused to get a full time job to let me stay home. I\u2019ve asked him since November to get a part time job as I had to step down from my sales job due to my heart issues but he \u201chasn\u2019t found anything\u201d. We\u2019re both on the spectrum as well and on wait lists for therapists. I\u2019ve tried lots of the online services but it\u2019s hard enough for him to talk to an actual person he was just completely blowing the online ones. I love who he was and I know he can be if he just admitted how deep his depression is. He\u2019s an amazing dad who was homeschooling our kids until this September for the last 4 years so I know that plays a role too. I told him to go work at his old golf course he used to for a few hours in exchange of a membership so he could be out doing stuff he loves but that and p!ss!ng in a violin would be the same. So I just put my head down and keep our family moving in hopes he wakes up but I\u2019m tired and in pain and I\u2019ve grown resentment over the last year. Sorry for emptying my bag.", "No worries, we are all here to help one another. We will all heal in time and happiness is something that will come in time as well for both of us. Thank you"]}
