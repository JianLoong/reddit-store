The home night can be something like a movie just the two of us, baking something together, etc. it\u2019s up to the person planning to come up with the idea and the other party is not supposed to do any work, just show up. \n\nIt\u2019s been really fun for us to plan these and connect better.

There's nothing wrong with asking for some concentrated attention.\n\nMaybe use kids as an analogy. What happens when you have multiple kids, but you don't spend focused time with them one on one? You the classic narratives all orbiting the concepts of \"I was never the priority,\" or \"x parent wasn't really around,\" or \"I didn't feel like x parent really cared about my feelings,\" etc etc etc.  \n\nThis isn't different for adults either. There are times where everyone wants to feel like they're being prioritized. Right now you don't feel that way, and that's a problem.\n\nNow from your husband's perspective, whether or not that's a problem may differ from his perspective; meaning whether or not time is really being committed to prioritizing you . You use in your example driving kids places together, sometimes that's going to be impractical given the responsibilities you both are carrying as heads of household. \n\nWhat I'm getting at here is that while you're feelings are valid, and you should feel prioritized; you may need to calibrate your expectations a bit vis-a-vis when that makes sense, and when it doesn't. Your husband probably has a few good points regarding what will and won't work for that, as do you. \n\nIf he does, that doesn't mean he gets to throw up his hands and say \"see I was right,\" because that set of feelings you're experiencing still need to be addressed; but it should certainly inform the conversation around how you two are actually going to solve the problem.", "I'm kind of like your husband in that the wife plans the activities and I'll occasionally veto something here or there based on logistics.\n\nWe do have multiple hobbies/interests were share and always make time for 1:1 time.

You need to communicate with him that while he is happy, you are growing discontent.", "NTA.\n\nPeople have identities beyond legal roles like \"wife/mother\" and \"husband/father\". You're still individuals. And when people forget that and become absorbed in their legal roles, they often breed resentment within themselves. You're just acutely aware it's happening.\n\nYou're not overreacting or being too sensitive or needy. You're an individual. And you want a relationship with your partner beyond the confines of the \"parent\" role. It's no different than loving your partner but wanting to enjoy time with your friends. What will he tell your kids when they start becoming more independent? \"We're a family, you don't need to hang out with anyone else?\"\n\nThis is also a long-term issue (especially since you became parents so early). When parents forget about their relationship with each other, it all falls apart when they become empty nesters. Relationships of ALL kinds take work, regardless of the other factors involved. And he's not putting in the work. So when your kids move out, it's just going to be the two of you.

This sounds like the story of an old Motown song (that I can't remember) about needing to give the kids to grandma for the weekend and try one last time to save a relationship.  This is obvious where things are heading.  You might have to 'take command' of the logistics need to 'get him alone'.  Are the kids old enough to 'go to camp'?  If so, arrange for ALL of them to go to 'away camp' during spring break or summer/.  You need at least a week.  After that is planned, then work on yourself through self care activities.  After that, maybe arrange couple activities that he doesn't realize are couple activities.   Your friends or Reddit probably has ideas about what that would mean.", "NTA and it's important to remember that your relationship should exist without the kids. At some point they will leave and it will be the two of you. Will you enjoy that? Maintaining connection to your spouse involves more than just sex. If you have zero time together outside your kids and sex then you may find yourselves without much of a relationship.

That said, I hear two issues from you, one is that you never do things together and the other is that you are the only one to plan this.  Time for a bigger discussion about expectations and your relationship.  Besides your kids, what relationship do you have? This is something you need to discuss privately as a couple.

He may be happy with the status quo, but you are not and so something needs to happen.  I'd suggest stop expecting him to arrange something he's not needing and instead arrange what you need when you need it.  Then, go off alone and enjoy whatever you have planned.

Its not that they don't like each other anymore, but its always the same, both grew as ppl but not in the same direction, never did the effort to correct it (bc kids and blabla) and when the kids moved out they realised they grew so much apart, they don't love each other anymore romantically and don't even know each other anymore after 18+ years of cohabiting (with sex). \n\nI'm sorry for you and you should tell him you guys not being a real couple anymore but just a part of a family unit leads to your feelings towards him turning from romantic love to love you feel for a brother.

NTA.", "NTA Your feelings are valid. You want romance and that isn't insane in a romantic relationship. It seems like he is setting himself up for a rough time when your kids move out. Then you two will be alone with no rhythm and have to re-learn each other as individuals. \n\nMy husband is painfully independent as well. So I have to work with him by saying I want a date then we take that general idea and work it into something together. But that took years of explaining that watching TV at night isn't a date. If we make a thing of it, it can be, but being in the same space isn't inherently romantic.", "I\u2019m having the same problems.It sucks . It\u2019s like they really don\u2019t care anything about you at all", "NTA. That is absolutely not \u201cjust how life is\u201d. There\u2019s a couple on tiktok that posts their monthly date nights, one in the house and one out of the house. They take turns planning. This has been a game changer in my relationship, because my spouse and I had a similar issue. No kids, but quality time is the most important to me. To my spouse, passive time was the same as quality time. Watching TV together is the same in her mind, because that\u2019s how her family \u201cspent time\u201dtogether growing up and even now. Hopefully you can find a solution, but definitely NTA.", ">He sees no reason for alone time, \u201cwe\u2019re a family\u201d\n\n>His view: this is how life is. Im slowly starting to see him as a friend I raise kids with. Our conversation is limited to kids/life logistics. We have no common hobby together. \n\n>If a family or friend visit from out of town, he would put in the extra effort to plan meals together and activities so it\u2019s not like he isn\u2019t capable. He just doesn\u2019t see the need to do it for just us.\n\nWhat your husband doesn't realize is that when you are older and the kids have moved out, it will be just the two of you. By that point, you will both have grown apart and changed. No one is ever the same as they were 10+ years ago. \n\nIf your husband doesn't learn to get to know you now as his wife and not just the mother of his kids, he will not recognize the person he married. No marriage is perfect; it takes more than having kids to have a healthy marriage. Communicate, do things together, get to know each other as you both grow *together.*\n\nNTA. I would suggest couples counseling so your husband can understand why this is important and if he wants to save his \"perfect\" marriage.", "NTA. Your husband needs to understand how important it is to keep your marriage strong, outside of the kids. One day, the kids will be gone. They'll be living their own lives, starting their own families (maybe), and then what? My husband and I make it a point to have dates at least 2-3 times a month. I always tell him that we have to remember that we like each other, not just love each other.", "Nta. If he is more than capable to act the part when other people are around then he's choosing not to do what needs to be done when people aren't. He's dumping the mental load on you and then gaslighting you into thinking that you're the problem.\nYou're not wrong for wanting a shared hobby for the two of you to do together.", "NTA. This is what happened in my marriage. The resentment eventually did make it to the bedroom, which made the divide even wider. Then wandering eyes happened and we\u2019ve been separated for 5 years, with no chance of a reconciliation. We did couples counselling and counselling separately but nothing could repair our \u201cmarriage\u201d. I really hope the best for you two and that he stops taking you for granted. Marriage takes work and can be hard, but it should never leave one of you feeling resentful, alone, and hurt.", "NTA you're not asking for much, and what you are asking for is a good thing.", "NTA. \n\nThis is where I\u2019m currently at with my husband as well and we\u2019ve only been married a year :/\nAnd it seems no matter how I put it, it doesn\u2019t matter because \u201cwe\u2019re together every day\u201d .\n\nPlease please please try to make it clear that he needs to prioritize you more. You shouldn\u2019t have to feel the way you do for the rest of your life", "Stop looking to do things with him and start looking for things you enjoy by yourself. You'll be a happier person and chances it will be a shock for him to find out you can be happy without his company. NTA.", "NTA and I feel your pain. \n\nThis sucks, but honestly the best solution might be acceptance that you are the proactive member of the relationship in this area.  If the relationship is otherwise working and he\u2019s fun to hang out with during date nights, but just won\u2019t initiate them, I think it\u2019s probably worth just scheduling them yourself.  I realize that this may take some of the romance out of it, but it\u2019s also a bit freeing to be the one in control.  Also, just because you are the proactive one doesn\u2019t mean you should do all the work:  buy tickets to a concert, inform him that he\u2019s going, and tell him he\u2019s in charge of logistics.", "NTA. You need to tell him that he\u2019s moving into marital friend zone. That\u2019s not good if he\u2019s someone who wants to stay married. I\u2019ve seen this play out a ton with couples once the kids leave home.", "NTA.  Why don't you make a short list of activities you think you might do together - go to the gym to work out together, take dance lessons, find local live music venues, take up hiking.  It's work to do this, but it sounds like your marriage is worth it to you.", "This is the most heartbreaking part, I have. Night usually ends with him crying about HIM being hurt by my words. Then nothing changes. We did counseling right after kids born. He planned a date night or 2, then things went back to \u201cnormal\u201d. I thought it was just young kids exhaustion. But honestly nothing has change with kids now older.", "Thank you for this. He\u2019s convinced me I\u2019m overreacting, this is what marriage is like. I feel so lonely", "Second this. I kind of get his approach (and my husband would get yours). We do game together though and that\u2019s our alone time since kids. Aside from counseling I think trying to find a hobby you can do together is great. I woodwork with him even though the quiet time he takes in his mind measuring drives me crazy. He sometimes paints with me even though he doesn\u2019t feel confident in it. Board and computer games together are the best for us.\n\nEdit Nta", "Heck yes on the love languages part. My husband and I had a really in depth conversation about this when we were dating and it had helped us communicate a lot more effectively. Sometimes physical touch is what I\u2019m looking for, sometimes it\u2019s quality time. Being able to understand what your (and his) love languages are is a good start.", "I agree with this. I would also still plan those vacations but only for OP. Like where do you want to go, what do you want to do. Look, It sucks but at least you can make you feel better(hopefully until he figures his thing out) .", "That\u2019s seriously all I ask! Just spend sometime alone. The last \u201cdate\u201d we had was so awkward, it was like we didn\u2019t know what to do with ourselves anymore. I now feel more comfortable alone with friends than alone with my husband", "You\u2019re not asking too much. If one person is unhappy in a marriage, it\u2019s not working. Perhaps he would be open to revisiting counselling, if that\u2019s the only option left for you (which it sounds like it could be).", "Then he's not understanding. He's *pretending* to be in front of the third party.", "Many many times. He looked hurt by me bringing up every time (it\u2019s now getting more frequent). I don\u2019t know how to move past this.", "She says she has been open with him (in the comments) and that's made no difference.", "In the comments, she says they tried it, he didn't like it, and he refuses to consider it again.", "She has told him; it's mentioned in a comment. He \"looks hurt,\" but nothing changes.", "Sadly, reading thru her comments makes me wonder how much good that will do.\n\nShe's says he's told him, and he \"looks hurt,\" in a later comment she says he even cries because he's hurt, but doesn't change his behavior.\n\nAnd that they have been to counseling, and they had a \"date night\" for a time or two and then it stopped.\n\nSounds like he doesn't want/see the need to change.", "In one of the comments, she said they had therapy, he didn't like it, and refuses to consider it again.", "What will?", "I think husband is def being an AH. There's a problem in their marriage and he refuses to deal with it.\n\nI don't think you can say she \"made her choice\" either. She didn't know how he'd behave once they had kids.", "I love my kids to death, wouldnt trade them for the world but im starting to understand why people choose not to have kids", "I doubt it, because it seems to be the kids that have set this off in him.", "Or start exercising together x", "Okay OP back to couples counseling.  Looks like that's your safe space to express yourself so he can't manipulate you to shut you up.....and it IS manipulation.  You can't have an honest conversation with your husband without it ending in him being hurt and offended and you feeling guilty and therefore putting your needs on the backburner.....again!  Manipulation, plain and simple.  I suggest individual counseling so you can get clear on what manipulation looks like; on what your needs are and understanding that its not wrong to want those needs met and what it will take to get them met.  You also need to discover what your deal breakers are.\n\nIf he refuses couples counseling, then do individual counseling.  You need help to get you out of this \"stuck\" feeling.  You have to start thinking differently and you need clarity to do so.  Life's too short to go through it being resentful and resentment is poison to a marriage.  If you're not going to actively do something to change things then its simply a matter of time before you're contemplating divorce.", "Maybe he needs stronger words? \"I don't see us staying married after the kids leave the house unless you learn to prioritize me now.\" Good luck, OP. Definitely NTA.", "He is getting everything he wants. Notice how you being happy in your marriage isn't on the list -- another commenter pointed out that he sees you having a certain level of unhappiness as perfectly fine and something that shouldn't be fixed.\n\nSo he's not going to change. Not so long as he keeps getting everything he wants.\n\nSo you should accept that he has very clearly answered you and start doing what you want based on this being your reality. Build your life into what you want it to be, without him along for the ride because he's not interested. Maybe that means nights out for yourself. Maybe it means more drastic change. But make changes. That's the only way there will be any.", "So he\u2019s manipulative and makes it about him. NTA. But he sure is.", "Maybe see about breakfasts or mornings  together. I know a lot of couples struggle with alone time due to their schedules and their kids but the mornings are a little easier. He\u2019s content with your current life and you\u2019re not.", "It's not \"what marriage is like.\" It's what YOUR marriage is like. At least for now. My mother told me one of the most important things they did once they had kids was to schedule alone time together; they had a weekly \"date night\" much of the time when we kids, for ex, and we'd looked after by other family/friends while they went out. When we were older they would take occasional trips together.\n\nHe might be happy, but you're not happy, so how can it be a \"happy family\"?\n\nI have heard of his scenario where the couple is completely caught up in the kids' lives, and then when the kids grow up and leave they find they have nothing in common any more, so they get divorced.\n\nOh, NTA.", "I hate that he\u2019s convinced you your feelings aren\u2019t valid. That really sucks and it\u2019s manipulative, and he also uses tears and his \u2018feelings\u2019 to get you to shut up? It\u2019s bordering on emotional abuse, or least emotional neglect. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t want to change. Idk if couples counseling will work, but it might be ultimatum time; if things don\u2019t change, you\u2019re going to leave. And then if things don\u2019t change, you have to actually leave and choose yourself/choose to find a partner who is willing to compromise and grow with you.", "It's what his parents' marriage was like.", "NTA, and marriage and good relationships are *not* like this. Your situation is more like a FWB or roommates who share kids. That sounds awful, and certainly not what you deserve, you didn't have your children to lose your husband. \n\nI would lobby hard for counseling, or that you are seriously contemplating his \"divide and conquer\" and that you truly are beginning to feel that this is turning into a marriage of convenience, and not one that you are interested in long term. Do you have friends you can do enjoyable things with? I hate feeling lonely in a relationship, and although it's not the same, it's better than what you've got. You do everything together except for be alone...what do you even talk about other than domestic issues?", "This is what marriage is like *for him*. Because he gets what he wants and his needs are prioritized.\n\nYou have to *both* be happy in a marriage. He's content, because he's doing what he wants.

Sure, things may slow down once there is a routine and kids, but it should never stop.", "Pretty much EVERYTHING EVER WRITTEN ABOUT MARRIAGE talks about keeping the romance, prioritizing the relationship so the kids can rely on a solid foundation, having to keep putting in the effort, etc etc. Date nights are a bare minimum. \n\nI'd tell him if he can't put in the effort, your marriage will not last. Private couples time is absolutely essential. You are not a happy family right now. Is he okay with you being unhappy?", "I mean, it could be that the marriage might be over? Not saying it is, but after reading some of your comments here, I think it is more urgent than it reads in the original post, and you have to make him understand. Or at some point, you will fall for someone else with pretty eyes I guess because that longing for closeness has no fullfillment in the marriage anymore. \n\nSay you want a marriage counsellor. Dont say you wish to like to habe, say you want counselling. \n\nAlternative is divorce or living parallel lives as soon as the kids are out if the house. I See it with my parents to an extend (and many other).", "That's a bad sign. Once the kids leave, there goes the marriage.", "You need to tell him this exactly.  Because it won't get better with time.", "Somehow you'll have to tell him that \"I understand you're hurt and I hate that this situation is hurting us both. Right now, I need this conversation to stay focused on finding solutions or we'll keep having to talk about this. This isn't a personal attack on you and I appreciate and love you very much.

As long as you keep your mouth shut, his life is *great.* \n\nYou have two fundamentally different visions for a good marriage. There may not be a way to reconcile them.", "sounds like therapy is needed then. or the other option would be leaving. Sadly, I know I am in this exact situation myself.", "The kids aren't the problem here, it's lack of focus on the couple part of your relationship. You need to have an honest discussion and don't write off couples therapy because it \"didn't work\" before. It's not a mechanic's shop and only \"works\" if both parties involved agree on an issue and agree to work toward solving said issue then actually do the work. If one partner refuses to participate or work toward something better then I'm afraid you don't have a relationship, but a roommate and child care assistant.", "Maybe show him this post.
