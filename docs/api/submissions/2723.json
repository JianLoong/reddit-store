Perfectly reasonable request that's not just helpful for you but for the rest to know what to bring or not. What you're doing is a huge undertaking and if they don't want to be respectful and helpful then maybe you don't need to host in the future.", "NTA. How do people in their 50s not know how this is done? This is so bizarre to me.\nOf course they should bring the food already cooked. Of course they should communicate with the person in charge.", "NTA\n\nThey are treating you like the maid, rather than a member of the family.", "NTA. For the love of all that\u2019s holy how do 50+ year olds not know how to cook Thanksgiving dinner?\n\nNo single thanksgiving dish is that hard, it\u2019s preparing 8 different dishes for 25+ people that is hard.\n\nStop letting them take advantage of you, they\u2019re just trying to do the least and get the most.", "I would say maybe they aren\u2019t comfortable with you but it\u2019s 15 years later. \n\nSo NTA", "NTA\n\nThey should at least do the bare minimum. If they expect you to cook everything at least they can communicate with you.", "NTA, you are putting in a lot of time, effort, and energy to cook a meal that no one else \"can\". If they didn't bother to learn to cook, the least they could do is show you basic respect. You are literally doing them a huge favor, they shouldn't treat you like that.", "NTA. You would be the asshole if you were demanding direct communication out of the blue, but past experience now justifies it.", "NTA\n\nHusband does not want to add you to group chat about the meal, therefore, the entire meal prep is on him. He does the cleaning. He does the shopping . He does the cooking. He does the cleanup afterwards.", "NTA. This is ridiculous, especially since it\u2019s gone on a second year. IF you want to host again (which would be a HUGE if in my mind), I think you absolutely do need to totally take over if you want this to work.

In 2023 start looking for reservations about 4 months in advance for Thanksgiving. If you look in October or November, they might be all booked.", "NTA. You are bearing the brunt of cooking and work. It is extremely rude not to ask YOU what should be brought directly. What's wrong with these people?", "NTA.

I mean, he could have read it and bring what isn't on the list, but I don't think he's trying to exclude you out. Also, some people just like to be told what to do personally and keep it simple, short and leave it from there. Like for an example, the group chat I'm in. There's so many of us for Thanksgiving and sometimes the comments aren't even related to Thanksgiving. Some people just be having their own little conversations that they could make another group and chat amongst themselves. I just tell them what we're making and don't read it anymore.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t ask for anything unreasonable.

You\u2019re doing the cooking but you\u2019re wanting them to coordinate with you on bringing stuff in crockpots?\n\nIf I said I were doing the cooking for 25 people, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if somebody were to say hey, can I bring some pie or something? But it would never occur to me that anybody would, or be expected to, bring a side dish in a crockpot.\n\nIf I weren\u2019t doing the cooking but was famous throughout my family for some particular special side dish, I might think, hey, I\u2019ll ask my brother if I should bring my famous whatever to the meal as an extra. I wouldn\u2019t be thinking the rest of my siblings were doing the same thing - it would just be one extra side dish added to the meal, not my share of \u201cexpected\u201d sibling side dishes. It wouldn\u2019t occur to me I had to \u201ccoordinate\u201d with anyone.\n\nI don\u2019t blame you for being annoyed with your husband but I think there is confusion around whether this is supposed to be a potluck with you cooking a turkey, and maybe some mashed potatoes - which it sounds to me like you\u2019re thinking - or a feast cooked by you with one or two extras contributed by family members because it\u2019s their family favourite \u201cspecial dish.\u201d\n\nBetween you and your in-laws, I\u2019m going to say NAH.

SHE can choose to eat elsewhere and not cook at all.   \n\n\nLook, my husband invites folks for dinner all the time - sometimes even without checking first (although that's stunningly rare).

Your cooking services. Except they expect you to act like the help that lives downstairs and they don\u2019t have to talk to you. The fact they refuse to text you is ridiculous.

Honey, he doesn't want to deal with the conflict that will happen if he says you won't cook. He doesn't want to deal with the conflict that could happen if you raise the expectations on the family via the group chat. So he went the back route.

You say they don't know how to cook, so don't expect them to cook.. it's pretty simple.\n2. If you want to have a less stressful meal, buy it and everybody chip in.  Tons of grocery stores and restaurants have fantastic options.  Split the cost by person if you can't afford it.\n3. If you want home cooked...then own it and do it.\n4. WHY can't you send out a text or email without a huge discussion with your hubby.  Jeez... just do it instead of talking about how everyone should know what you want without you ever saying it.\n5. DO NOT wait until days before a holiday to set expectations.  You need to let people know what your expectations are and give them time to decide if that works for them instead of waiting until the final hour and bitching because your husband's brother finally reached out and your hubby didn't know how to respond. \n6. At least a few weeks or month+ send out your list.  Note what needs to be made.  Ask people to sign up and give them a deadline of 2 weeks before the holiday so you know what still needs to be done.  When someone doesn't reach out... you contact them.\n7. Also, when you see a cooked item let them know you don't have oven space, so it needs to be in a crockpot or done before arrival.\n8.

In my family no one really wants to be the only one doing all the cooking, so everyone chips in money and has it catered. Most grocery stores will prepare your meal. Then we bring a few extras. Another dessert, rolls, beverages, and random treats (like deviled eggs and fudge). Then your texts could consist of 'Bob, you bring rolls. Jan bring pumpkin pie, Greg brings Sprite,' ect.\n\nWhen I was a kid I thought my grandma was a rock star for cooking all that food.

Make a list of what you still need and send a group text and ask everyone to text back what they can bring off that list.", "If they cant cook, they can do grocery shopping or contribute in terms of costs, and for others if they cant cook they wash the dishes after, others can lay the table, others can atleast make things that dont require much skill or buy it in.  Others can be given a receipe of something simple so for the first time every they do attempt to make something. They can start practicing. \n\nThing is why do  you bother when they are using you? Do it once then its someone elses turn next year. They have 365 days to get ready and practice. There are youtube videos, online classes, in person classes, recipe books - unless they have a learning difficulty there is is nothing to stop them hosting next year or splitting the dishes up between then.", "NTA\n\nThis is how every family event is planned in our family. My mom starts a group chat, everybody responds with what they're bringing, and people fill in the holes as necessary. It's really not complicated.", "Not enough time to sort it for this year, but make it clear to your husband that if he caves and volunteers you for the thankless job of hosting without asking you again, then he will be doing the cooking even if it means you have to stand over him at every step. Marriage is team work, not him taking all the credit for your hard work.", "We did have that conversation. I told him I\u2019m not cooking for Christmas. He loves to entertain, we have a perfect house for it. He said we would have everyone bring appetizers if Christmas ends up at our house.", "Kind of. One of them asked why I was putting milk and butter in the potatoes. She had only ever seen pouches of potatoes being made and had no idea how they are made from actual potatoes.", "I think I\u2019ll wait til his parents to pass before I stop cooking for the family. I\u2019m not doing it for his siblings, I\u2019m doing it so his parents don\u2019t have to. They are very old and can barely move, but if I don\u2019t cook, his mom will do it anyway. That\u2019s unfair to them. \n\nAfter they pass, they can choose to gather or not, and they can figure out food.", "Oh. That\u2019s even better!", "I can\u2019t have corn either. It\u2019s been a few years that I can\u2019t have gluten or corn. Knowing the after effects of eating either, I don\u2019t miss it. I have a great meat stuffing recipe that I prefer, I\u2019ll make that if I feel like eating stuffing.", "She just thought it was funny/tonic you asked."]}
