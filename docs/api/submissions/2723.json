And I want to tell them to bake their bread at home, and bring their sides cooked, in a crockpot, so it can be plugged in and kept warm.

Husband told me about this, and I responded that we have a group text regarding this, and asked him to ask me in that group. \n\nHe didn\u2019t. He said it\u2019s not necessary.

That\u2019s a pretty simple request. How hard would it be for them to type questions in the group chat rather than a text to only your husband? They sound inconsiderate.", "NTA. Perfectly reasonable request that's not just helpful for you but for the rest to know what to bring or not. What you're doing is a huge undertaking and if they don't want to be respectful and helpful then maybe you don't need to host in the future.", "NTA. How do people in their 50s not know how this is done? This is so bizarre to me.\nOf course they should bring the food already cooked. Of course they should communicate with the person in charge.", "NTA\n\nThey are treating you like the maid, rather than a member of the family.", "NTA. For the love of all that\u2019s holy how do 50+ year olds not know hire to cook Thanksgiving dinner?\n\nNo single thanksgiving dish is that hard, it\u2019s preparing 8 different dishes for 25+ people that is hard.\n\nStop letting them take advantage of you, they\u2019re just trying to do the least and get the most.", "I would say maybe they aren\u2019t comfortable with you but it\u2019s 15 years later. \n\nSo NTA", "NTA\n\nThey should at least do the bare minimum. If they expect you to cook everything at least they can communicate with you.", "NTA, you are putting in a lot of time, effort, and energy to cook a meal that no one else \"can\". If they didn't bother to learn to cook, the least they could do is show you basic respect. You are literally doing them a huge favor, they shouldn't treat you like that.", "NTA. You would be the asshole if you were demanding direct communication out of the blue, but past experience now justifies it.", "NTA\n\nHusband does not want to add you to group chat about the meal, therefore, the entire meal prep is on him. He does the cleaning. He does the shopping . He does the cooking. He does the cleanup afterwards.", "NTA. This is ridiculous, especially since it\u2019s gone on a second year. IF you want to host again (which would be a HUGE if in my mind), I think you absolutely do need to totally take over if you want this to work. If you don\u2019t, they\u2019ll continue this nonsense and all your hard work I\u2019ll be only partially successful. \n\nHave a complete list of all meal items, equipment, apps, drinks you need. Assign every single one of them to a person/couple. Include recipes and instructions for how and when you want it brought to you. Make sure the list is visible to everyone (group text or Google doc) so that they know who messed up if someone does and that it isn\u2019t you. \n\nThen ignore anything they discuss in group text without you and let it be water off a duck\u2019s back. If that doesn\u2019t work. Never do it again.", "NTA\nI would stop doing anything for the holidays. They sound insufferable", "**NTA** \n\nOf course they should contact you about requests!", "It sounds like your extended family needs to just accept the need to make a reservation at a restaurant. Depending on where you live, you can have the whole meal at the restaurant, or you can order the meal to take home. Split the cost evenly each year, and be done with it. It's too late for this year. In 2023 start looking for reservations about 4 months in advance for Thanksgiving. If you look in October or November, they might be all booked.", "NTA. You are bearing the brunt of cooking and work. It is extremely rude not to ask YOU what should be brought directly. What's wrong with these people?", "NTA.  It's more than reasonable to be in the group text, you need to know what people are bringing, what you'd like them to bring, what allergies people have, etc.", "ESH.\n\nClearly, ILs only like you because you cook, otherwise, they are not interested in what you want or think.\n\nYour husband should have handled his brother without talking to you first. Sounds like you somehow have taken his mother's place in telling him what to do.\n\nYou should not be hosting anything if 25 people can't be smart and respectful enough to help out and be prepared for the gathering.", "NTA really, but sometimes some people just don't like to write in the group chat cause there are so many things going on and so many different conversations. I mean, he could have read it and bring what isn't on the list, but I don't think he's trying to exclude you out. Also, some people just like to be told what to do personally and keep it simple, short and leave it from there. Like for an example, the group chat I'm in. There's so many of us for Thanksgiving and sometimes the comments aren't even related to Thanksgiving. Some people just be having their own little conversations that they could make another group and chat amongst themselves. I just tell them what we're making and don't read it anymore.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t ask for anything unreasonable. Your husbands siblings are entitled arseholes just expecting to be taken care of and sorry OP but your husband is a toolbag for not adding you into the first group and then not reinforcing the use of the group the second time, you guys are supposed to be a team and he\u2019s not got your back; he caved to your SIL to host a second time so you\u2019d think he\u2019d be like \u201cright ok lessons learnt, make sure everyone is in the group and using it so we can get our shit in order\u201d but no he didn\u2019t.", "I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m confused. You\u2019re doing the cooking but you\u2019re wanting them to coordinate with you on bringing stuff in crockpots?\n\nIf I said I were doing the cooking for 25 people, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if somebody were to say hey, can I bring some pie or something? But it would never occur to me that anybody would, or be expected to, bring a side dish in a crockpot.\n\nIf I weren\u2019t doing the cooking but was famous throughout my family for some particular special side dish, I might think, hey, I\u2019ll ask my brother if I should bring my famous whatever to the meal as an extra. I wouldn\u2019t be thinking the rest of my siblings were doing the same thing - it would just be one extra side dish added to the meal, not my share of \u201cexpected\u201d sibling side dishes. It wouldn\u2019t occur to me I had to \u201ccoordinate\u201d with anyone.\n\nI don\u2019t blame you for being annoyed with your husband but I think there is confusion around whether this is supposed to be a potluck with you cooking a turkey, and maybe some mashed potatoes - which it sounds to me like you\u2019re thinking - or a feast cooked by you with one or two extras contributed by family members because it\u2019s their family favourite \u201cspecial dish.\u201d\n\nBetween you and your in-laws, I\u2019m going to say NAH. Your husband may be.\n\nEdit: Have a Happy Thanksgiving! I\u2019m sure you will get it all worked out.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Am I wrong to expect communication directly to me, since I\u2019m preparing everything?\".. Yes. YOU Are the AH here. His brother contacted your husband directly, and you REFUSED to communicate.  So the lack of communication is YOUR fault. **This is an issue between YOU and your husband.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: **Why do you host, when you obviuously are not up to it?** Meet them at a restaurant?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Have you considered catering, instead of cooking?  Cooking for 25 is a large chore.  If no one else cooks, it could be worthwhile to ask for money contributions towards the meal.

Explain that your stove and oven will be full of the items you're providing, so everything they bring will need to be ready to serve.\n\nThen, only took and provide the items you stated you would be providing.  For instance, for Thanksgiving, it makes sense for you to cook the turkey, gravy, and stuffing.  Everyone else can bring drinks, bread, dessert, salad, and whatever other sides they might want.  \n\nAnd if they don't bring anything, then dinner will only consist of turkey and stuffing and gravy.
