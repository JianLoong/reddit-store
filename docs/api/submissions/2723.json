Perfectly reasonable request that's not just helpful for you but for the rest to know what to bring or not. What you're doing is a huge undertaking and if they don't want to be respectful and helpful then maybe you don't need to host in the future.", "NTA. How do people in their 50s not know how this is done? This is so bizarre to me.\nOf course they should bring the food already cooked. Of course they should communicate with the person in charge.", "NTA\n\nThey are treating you like the maid, rather than a member of the family.", "NTA. For the love of all that\u2019s holy how do 50+ year olds not know hire to cook Thanksgiving dinner?\n\nNo single thanksgiving dish is that hard, it\u2019s preparing 8 different dishes for 25+ people that is hard.\n\nStop letting them take advantage of you, they\u2019re just trying to do the least and get the most.", "I would say maybe they aren\u2019t comfortable with you but it\u2019s 15 years later. \n\nSo NTA", "NTA\n\nThey should at least do the bare minimum. If they expect you to cook everything at least they can communicate with you.", "NTA, you are putting in a lot of time, effort, and energy to cook a meal that no one else \"can\". If they didn't bother to learn to cook, the least they could do is show you basic respect. You are literally doing them a huge favor, they shouldn't treat you like that.", "NTA. You would be the asshole if you were demanding direct communication out of the blue, but past experience now justifies it.", "NTA\n\nHusband does not want to add you to group chat about the meal, therefore, the entire meal prep is on him.

It is extremely rude not to ask YOU what should be brought directly. What's wrong with these people?", "NTA.

I mean, he could have read it and bring what isn't on the list, but I don't think he's trying to exclude you out. Also, some people just like to be told what to do personally and keep it simple, short and leave it from there. Like for an example, the group chat I'm in. There's so many of us for Thanksgiving and sometimes the comments aren't even related to Thanksgiving. Some people just be having their own little conversations that they could make another group and chat amongst themselves. I just tell them what we're making and don't read it anymore.", "NTA.

You\u2019re doing the cooking but you\u2019re wanting them to coordinate with you on bringing stuff in crockpots?\n\nIf I said I were doing the cooking for 25 people, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if somebody were to say hey, can I bring some pie or something? But it would never occur to me that anybody would, or be expected to, bring a side dish in a crockpot.\n\nIf I weren\u2019t doing the cooking but was famous throughout my family for some particular special side dish, I might think, hey, I\u2019ll ask my brother if I should bring my famous whatever to the meal as an extra. I wouldn\u2019t be thinking the rest of my siblings were doing the same thing - it would just be one extra side dish added to the meal, not my share of \u201cexpected\u201d sibling side dishes. It wouldn\u2019t occur to me I had to \u201ccoordinate\u201d with anyone.\n\nI don\u2019t blame you for being annoyed with your husband but I think there is confusion around whether this is supposed to be a potluck with you cooking a turkey, and maybe some mashed potatoes - which it sounds to me like you\u2019re thinking - or a feast cooked by you with one or two extras contributed by family members because it\u2019s their family favourite \u201cspecial dish.\u201d\n\nBetween you and your in-laws, I\u2019m going to say NAH.

SHE can choose to eat elsewhere and not cook at all.   \n\n\nLook, my husband invites folks for dinner all the time - sometimes even without checking first (although that's stunningly rare). But - we plan it together, we divvy up the work and the load and as the person who's co-ordinating and doing the majority of the cooking, I'M the one who gets final say.", "I mean they are gaining something right now. Your cooking services. Except they expect you to act like the help that lives downstairs and they don\u2019t have to talk to you. The fact they refuse to text you is ridiculous. I know you said you and hubby have to eat but it is very different making a small holiday meal for two versus dealing with jerks not listening for 8. With just the two of you, you could pick up some Boston Market or something ahead of time. Glad you are letting the chips fall where they may. Maybe if they have another year of chaos they will learn. But I sadly doubt it.", "This is how you get burned out(no pun intended). \n\nEach time someone directly messages husband, either you or him should reply in the group message with a response from the direct message. \n\nEx. Bob asked what can he bring? Bob, you can bring mashed potatoes in a crockpot, so that they stay warm.", "Then I don\u2019t blame you for being frustrated as heck! I don\u2019t mind doing big dinners but if I\u2019m in the kitchen with someone else we had better be used to working together to produce a big holiday meal! The idea of somebody just randomly barging in and getting in the way while I\u2019m trying to coordinate everything to be hot at the same time...aargh.", "I\u2019m Canadian and our Thanksgiving is less of a production. It\u2019s a holiday meal with a turkey but I think everybody contributing a dish is less standard. Interesting all the little cultural differences between us!", "Damn straight.

He cleans.", ">I\u2019ll have my dessert though, and I will wait to bring it out til they leave.\n\nI aspire to be this kind of petty tbh. Honestly, NTA.

If you\u2019re going to be so spiteful and want to fail, why are you cooking and hosting?", "I grew up cooking for ten. It\u2019s how I learned to cook. I don\u2019t mind cooking. I do mind being kept out of the loop. But I solved it at the advice of another commenter by posting in the group text, essentially calling out BIL. I brought the conversation back up and now we have a group discussion again.", "Half of them left the food for me to prepare last time. That\u2019s why I was so specific about crockpots this time.", "When I was young and had the energy I thought it would be fun to host the holiday one year and just set the menu myself and prepare all the food - my mother always acted like I was trying to be controlling or picky or something. She even said once \u201cthat sounds uptight.\u201d Sheesh I thought it sounded fun!\n\nSo for every year we have big group texts where everyone hashes out who wants what and who is going to make it. It\u2019s fine I guess", "He \"caved\" on cooking, which isn't a task he performs. You do. \n\nHoney, he threw you under the bus to appease his family.", "I can't imagine how much fog you're in that you can't see this is exactly what it is. Honey, he doesn't want to deal with the conflict that will happen if he says you won't cook. He doesn't want to deal with the conflict that could happen if you raise the expectations on the family via the group chat. So he went the back route. Twice. \n\nFirst he agreed despite you not wanting to, stomping right over your boundary because your discomfort is easier for him to tolerate than yours. Then he refuses to use the group chat because again, your discomfort is easier to deal with than his own. \n\nThis is being thrown under the bus.", "I absolutely LOVE cooking! Holidays when I cook, you can expect a menu I started 2-3 months prior. There will be 7-8 appetizers, a ham and turkey with 7-10 sides. I do it all. I leave desserts and drinks to the company invited.\n\nWhat won't ever happen is my partner \"offering\" my services- especially without discussing it with me.\n\n You said you didn't want to this year because of the lack of cooperation,  but here you are..... cooking again and still no cooperation. \n\nHe threw you under the bus \n\nFamily would show up to the worst take out pizza I could get my hands on", "Or you could ask why. Mine is sugar free and gluten free. Most people don\u2019t like that. I prepare my own so I can enjoy the meal just like they do. I get tired of watching people eat regular food, and not being able to enjoy any.", "This is Reddit. Where you\u2019re damned if you do and you\u2019re damned if you don\u2019t. \n\nPeace out", "I mean, we know why, because nobody else knows how to cook. Not only that they won't communicate properly. Not sure why you're blaming OP for thinking it's funny if their failure to communicate means that things go to shit.", "Let them bring their uncooked food, say thanks, I can use this next week! Then put in the freezer", "Whenever people say that I'm just like yeah, thanks for showing me that you're basically here because you want to hand out YTA votes.", "I don't think it makes you an AH, but I do think you are taking this way too passively. Tell your husband you won't cook, or that you will only cook the meat, and stick to it. Or make assignments in the group text--this sibling is in charge of bread, this one veg, this one pies. When the brother went right to your husband, post in the group chat--'Keeping this here so everyone can see, Joe asked Mike what he could bring. Joe, could you bring mashed potatoes? How about Sarah and James, what are you bringing?'", "Holy crow.", "She does not want to see that, maybe in a few years she will open her eyes.", "You\u2019re so harsh. I feel sorry for you. \n\nI solved the problem by taking another commenters advice. That person didn\u2019t bash me, pity me, or put me down to fit their agenda. \n\nInstead, she said to go back to the group thread and inquire about what BIL said, and say I\u2019m keeping it here so I know what\u2019s going on and so does everyone else. Constructive advice. \n\nI did that. And now all the conversation is available to all of us. It worked!", "Wait. Do you have food allergies? But are cooking things you are allergic to for them?

I was already mind blown this broke me I think. Lol", "I actually think your plan is brilliant. Make a Turkey to serve. I\u2019d probably text the group text and say \u201cI\u2019m making Turkey and\u2026 and if you would all like to coordinate the rest that would be great. Note that my oven will be occupied so please bring things already cooked and the microwave will be free.\u201d\n\nAnd definitely don\u2019t share your dessert!", "Oh I like that idea! I\u2019m going to do that. Anything that\u2019s not cooked or baked when it enters my home will not get served. Perfect!!", "I like this, too!", "I like that. My husband deleted the group thread. He does that and it\u2019s weird. Anyway I think I will call his brother out on his antics! Thanks!", "It's so, so easy to fall into the emotional labor trap, where you start managing your husband's family and putting up with BS. I don't fault OP for that. \n\nBut biting my head off for pointing out the obvious pattern is ridiculous.", "I\u2019m right here. Stop talking about me. Just because I disagree with you or someone else doesn\u2019t mean I have to be pitied and slandered. \n\nMy husband cleans before and after. I cook. Does it fit your agenda to know how he contributes to the event?", "I do apologize if I came across rudely. Genuinely, I read posts like this so frequently and I call it like I see it. People pushing others around passively because they don't realize or want to recognize that they are being unfair and unkind. I don't have a change in my opinion. Your problem might be solved, and it's great that it is. But even people who are good and willing to communicate are capable of being minor jerks.", "Yep. I\u2019m the only one who can\u2019t eat gluten or sugar. I cook two of the things I want to eat. Most things are gluten free though. Not the stuffing or the bread or the pies.", "This is perfect. Make whatever you want to serve, and let them bring what they want to. If you get three sets of dinner rolls so be it, leftover rolls for everyone. If they bring food that's not ready, keep it out of the way for another day.

So yes you'll be discussed lmao.", "I feel like this adds another layer to it, and I honestly do believe it\u2019s crazy that you aren\u2019t on the group chat or told what people are bringing.

By not mentioning food allergies... that don't exist?", "Dude she wasn\u2019t criticizing you or your comment in any way.

Play stupid games win stupid prizes. You very clearly requested a simple piece of consideration in regards to being the ONLY ONE actually putting effort into this and making sure that THEIR family is able to get together for Thanksgiving. NTA and I would stop putting in the extra effort.", "I am going to disagree.   First,  YTA.  Not for what you are doing, but for your demands and how you are going about it.\n\n1.  You say they don't know how to cook, so don't expect them to cook.. it's pretty simple.\n2. If you want to have a less stressful meal, buy it and everybody chip in.  Tons of grocery stores and restaurants have fantastic options.  Split the cost by person if you can't afford it.\n3. If you want home cooked...then own it and do it.\n4. WHY can't you send out a text or email without a huge discussion with your hubby.  Jeez... just do it instead of talking about how everyone should know what you want without you ever saying it.\n5. DO NOT wait until days before a holiday to set expectations.  You need to let people know what your expectations are and give them time to decide if that works for them instead of waiting until the final hour and bitching because your husband's brother finally reached out and your hubby didn't know how to respond. \n6. At least a few weeks or month+ send out your list.  Note what needs to be made.  Ask people to sign up and give them a deadline of 2 weeks before the holiday so you know what still needs to be done.  When someone doesn't reach out... you contact them.\n7. Also, when you see a cooked item let them know you don't have oven space, so it needs to be in a crockpot or done before arrival.\n8. The last option is inviting them all over and teaching together.\n\nYTA for expecting everyone to adjust to the new rules without telling them what they actually are.", "NTA, it's not ridiculous to have contact with the people who you are going to be hosting a party for.\n\nHonestly this dynamic screams that they don't view you as an equal. Perhaps this is the last year that you should host since these individuals do not feel like they want to conduct themselves well with you, and it's giving you stress.", "This family sounds useless", "Simple solution cook what you think you need and if anyone complains just point out that you were kept in the dark about the plans so you made your own", "No communication, no dinner. Simple as that. NTA", "NTA, and I suspect they\u2019re all trash talking you in the group chat, hence the hesitation to add you (ONLY reason I can come up with for such a dumb refusal!)", "NAH - bcz it doesn't seem a big deal and doesn't seem you overreacted and made it into a big deal.  But, you're not preparing everything, if they're bringing dishes.  And, both they and you, are free to communicate with whoever they're more comfortable with.  As long as you ask hubby and he responds, you're all golden", "NTA - since you are cooking you need to know these details.\n\nMight I offer a suggestion for the future? In my family no one really wants to be the only one doing all the cooking, so everyone chips in money and has it catered. Most grocery stores will prepare your meal. Then we bring a few extras. Another dessert, rolls, beverages, and random treats (like deviled eggs and fudge). Then your texts could consist of 'Bob, you bring rolls. Jan bring pumpkin pie, Greg brings Sprite,' ect.\n\nWhen I was a kid I thought my grandma was a rock star for cooking all that food. I was in my 30s before I knew about the catering and it makes so much sense. We always brought soda and rolls.

My BFF, her hubby, me, and my hubs have a group text.  Whenever my BFF and I start making plans in a separate text, one of us will usually say ok let\u2019s take this to the group so the rest are in on planning. \n\nIt was that simple.  Husband could have started with the convo but then gone into the group to share the plans.  Not only helpful to you, but also to everyone else bringing stuff.", "NTA. This is weird behavior. What is your relationship like with these people?

You seem weirdly touchy.", "Maybe it sounds over dramatic to you but didn\u2019t he kind of do that, I mean you said you weren\u2019t doing it anymore and then his squeezed him and lemons came out. I mean if you\u2019re cute ok\u2019ing there should be basic respect, your BIL is not respecting your wishes, personally you say the parents are really old but unless you really feel there might be an accident, maybe you should let them continue the tradition bcuz it was working for everybody and now its not, if its not broken, leave it alone.", "Right, but you shouldn't even be cooking since he's the one who caved and offered to host. You are still doing the Lion's share of the work, and he won't even push that his family needs to pull their weight because all of the work that comes from them not cooking, falls on you.

Like, really grasp that this is NOT how healthy, functional families communicate?\n\nIf he does not, and instead just perceives it as you getting upset because you\u2019re different, why on earth would he go against his entire programming and upset his brother?\n\nIt sounds like your husband is just fine with the existing dysfunctional family dynamic.
