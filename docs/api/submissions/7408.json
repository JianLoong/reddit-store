Her family sounds crazy.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to recommend because she\u2019s being super irrational by this and maybe you should reconsider if being a part of that family is even worth it\u2026\nIf you want to stay around and want to get on good terms for them maybe you should apologize a lot (even though is not your fault) explain the situation and promise her it\u2019s not gonna happen again. But idk if this is even gonna work", "INFO: where was your gf? Did she specifically ask you to mind the daughter?", "INFO: Did any of this come up before you went to bed?  If this was a, \"no, I want to sleep at my own place tonight\" deal, that might have a different answer than if this first came up at 2am.\n\nEdit NTA", "NTA-perfectly normal to not expect an answer at that hour and a parent was already present. This is barely an emergency and definitely not your emergency. \n\nSorry I can\u2019t help further, but your GF was out of line.", "NTA If anything, your girlfriend is ta for leaving her daughter alone at night when she deals with anxiety being left alone. *and now* she\u2019s mad at you as if it\u2019s your fault. Which is bullshit. Your girlfriend is projecting here. \n\nWhy didn\u2019t her daughter call her, and she could have left work? \n\nAs an aside, I\u2019d put my phone on Do Not Disturb, so that any random calls go to VM, but in an emergency, a multiple attempt caller will ring through. But even saying this doesn\u2019t mean you were negligent.", "NTA and... How do I put this without being insensitive? Oh well, you are in charge of your own life, if you are fine becoming a 24/7 emotional support for your girlfriend's daughter good for you, if not, you better have a talk, a LOOONG talk with your girlfriend on what she can reasonably expect from you.", "NTA. Your gf is the parent. If she needs you to be on parent duty you need to first agree to it, then be informed about when it's happening, and only then, practically, set an exception to your Do Not Disturb so you can be reached. Not sure how she expects you to do all that without so much as discussing it.", "NTA\n\nIt's unfortunate she wasn't able to reach you, but you were sleeping. It's not like your were actively ignoring her. Same would have happend if you would haven't your phone downstairs or forgot it in your car. It has nothing to do with not caring, it just happens.", "NTA\n\n\nThat said the terms of your relationship and availability in that relationship are up to you and your GF.\n\nI intentionally don't sleep in the same room as my phone. I get work alerts on it overnight and do not want to be disturbed.", "NTA. Your gf's daughter is not your responsibility, neither is her anxiety. She is however her MOTHER's responsibility so maybe she needs to reconsider working night's if her daughter cannot stay at home alone nor has the strategies to manage her own anxiety effectively. It's not a crime to get some decent sleep ffs.  Good luck!", "NTA\n\nTo be blunt she is fifteen years old. I'd empathise more if she was like ten years old or younger etc. She needs to accept that there are going to be times where she will be left alone, anxiety or not. Plus it's not really fair on you being woken up at stupid o'clock in the morning because a teenager is feeling anxious.", "She will not ask for your help again? Good! You're not her emotional support animal. \n\nI think this relationship is doomed, not because she has anxiety attacks, but for thinking you should be at her beck and call and somehow responsible for her getting better. Can you imagine the life you'd have if you were living together?\n\nNTA\n\nEdit : I didn't realize at first it was about the daughter, but my point stand.", "2:00 AM?  No sober person, not even a therapist, can be expected to be readily available at that time of the night because someone is having an anxiety attack. \n\nSince your girlfriend was with her daughter, it was on the two of them to manage this attack.  \n\nYour girlfriend is being unreasonable. NTA", "NTA. You didn\u2019t do anything on purpose, you were tired and slept. If it\u2019s not unusual for you to have your phone on vibrate, I know mine is 99% of the time, then she should\u2019ve known that.\n\nAnxiety is a horrible condition, but unless she asked you to be on standby she can\u2019t hold this against you.", "NTA\n\nGet out mate, this is a taste of what you'll get forever, over everything she doesn't like that you do", "NTA.  Your girlfriend is being unreasonable.  I hope her daughter is in intensive therapy for her anxiety issue.", "You were unconscious, as is any reasonable person at 2am and it wasn\u2019t an emergency. NTA. They all need to get a grip.", "NTA\n\nYou went to bed at 10, fell asleep and put your phone on silent, which seems like most people do overnight these days. How were you to know her daughter would have anxiety like that in the middle of the night? Your gf never asked you to keep your phone on for this situation, or asked you to stay over so her daughter wouldn't be alone. They put you in a lose-lose situation here and that's totally unfair.", "NTA. I don't see what you did wrong. For what it's worth I don't think I've taken my phone off vibrate in more than a decade.", "NTA, problems that start at 2 am can wait until the morning. enjoy your sleep in peace.", "NTA. Your gf needs to get her daughter counseling. Why couldn't she call her father rather than her mother's bf?", ">Now my GF is telling me she'll never ask for my help again.\n\nWin-win.\n\nIf you let a person manipulate you by guilting you, they'll keep doing it. The only way around it is to avoid reacting to it. Even though it feels like a knife to the heart, even though you feel horrible about it...don't give them the reaction they're looking for.\n\nAnd NTA, of course.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sounds like your GF also has anxiety she needs to deal with.", "NTA- it is unfortunate that you missed her calls but it's not realistic of her to expect you to be there for her all the time. You didn't ignore her, you simply fell asleep and her saying she will never ask for your help again is in my opinion a no go. She just wants you to feel really guilty and bad even tho you did not intend to do something that upsets her. Maybe talk to her that you will try something like that won't happen again but that she should communicate her (unrealistic )expectations to you beforehand. Good luck, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA", "NTA, logically it makes no sense for them to blame you for anything.  Emotionally though logic gets it's but thrown to the curb and stomped on in these cases.  It's like being blamed for cheating in a dream your SO has then wakes up mad at you.  \n\nYou can either apologize for what they perceive as abandonment or tell them this makes no sense and move on from this situation to someone who doesn't blame you for living a normal life.", "NTA. they're just not entitled to your time especially when you're sleeping.", "NTA, who keeps their ringer on at night anyway!!!  If your girlfriend wants a babysitter for her kid she can hire one.  Your not the parent.  You don\u2019t live together.  You didn\u2019t agree to middle of the night emotional breakdowns with someone else\u2019s child.  You may want to discuss your expected role in her child\u2019s life.", "NTA. I see in one of your comments that your girlfriend didn\u2019t specifically ask you to be there that night. You shouldn\u2019t be to blame for being unconscious. People usually don\u2019t have their ringers on 24/7.", "You\u2019re NTA here. Her expectations are a little ridiculous. Nothing was said about being available if her daughter would if needed you. She\u2019s mad at the situation but taking it out in your unfairly!!", "NTA.  I understand why your GF is stressed and upset, but she is wrong to take her frustration out on you.  You did nothing wrong.    Don\u2019t accept the notion that you should be on call 24/7.", "NTA with a suggestion. Set up the Do Not Disturb on your phone to allow her (and anyone else close to you) to ring through. A lot of modern phones also have the ability to allow someone to ring through if they repeat call you within 15 minutes.", "NTA. She\u2019s upset her daughter was upset and taking it out on you.", "INFO: has this ever happened before? We\u2019re you aware that if an emergency came up you were the person responsible for your girlfriends child? \n\nIF you\u2019re responsible for someone else you need to have your ringer on all the time. You can put dnd with exceptions for certain people. If not then your girlfriend needs to find someone you can help in emergencies and let them know.\n\nEdit: saw your comment that this wasn\u2019t relayed to you NTA but a good learning curve for your GF to get an emergency plan in place", "NTA maybe her actual parent should be available 24/7 if it matters that much and if she cares about her daughter who suffers from anxiety?\n\nWhat would be her plan for her daughter if you weren\u2019t together?\n\nIf she can\u2019t check her phone at work, then she needs to figure something out. If that means having you on call, that\u2019s something you\u2019d have to agree to so you know to keep the appropriate setting on your phone.\n\nMaybe gf is feeling guilty for not being there for her daughter in that moment and is lashing out.", "NTA - You're allowed to sleep at night. Your girlfriend needs to grow up. Yes, it's nice having help available in case of an emergency, but grown ups have to be able to handle emergencies on their own. Also, this wasn't an emergency.", "I have notifications that push through for my kids and my partner since I\u2019m his emergency contact, otherwise my phone is always on vibrate. nta", "If the expectation to look out for her/be on call was not made clear and present NTA.", "OMG, NTA. Time to set boundaries and realistic (based in reality) expectations.", "Sorry I must have left that out. She has to work nights. Her house is about fifteen minutes drive from me... She was at work. She did not ask me to watch her daughter that night", "Not at all. We both knew I was going to my own house. Went to bed with no understanding that I was to take care of the daughter. I just woke up to learn that I wasn't there when they needed me", "To be clear, his GF was at work. He just wasn't asked beforehand to stay over at her place to watch her daughter.", "NTA. You gf and her daughter need to deal with daughters anxiety. Fwiw, no one leaves their phone ringer on. Not even old people", "Wrong. I, almost 50, leave my ringer on so that my mother or the Life Alert service can reach me. It is vital to be available for emergencies. With most cellphones, you have the option to silence for set hours with the exception of specific phone numbers.", "I haven't had any of the sounds enabled on my phone for so long that one time when I accidentally turned the sound on and it made a noise, I nearly had a heart attack.  I legitimately did not even recognise my ring tone. I thought it was the smoke alarm going off or something.  \n\nTurns out, it was a spam caller. Which reminded me why I never turn my ringer on in the first place.", "That attitude is how I ended up being in the ER in the middle of the night with my grandmother on multiple occasions.  Her daughter couldn't be bothered to leave her phone turned on, despite the fact that she was the emergency contact for the assisted living.  After the first time they couldn't reach her, they added my number as a secondary contact.\n\nIf you have family and/or friends, you should be prepared for emergencies.", "I always have my sound on unless I'm in meetings. I have never been called during the night and I sleep through text messages", "You\u2019re expecting the worst and you\u2019re also the outlier. I put my phone on DND for everyone. I don\u2019t have to be available to anyone for anything.", "You\u2019re expecting that your mother might call. That\u2019s what different. In everyday life, most people don\u2019t leave their ringers on", "This girl is 15, not elderly. She\u2019s not a fall risk nor is she disabled. She could have called her mother to be talked down. The bf was not informed he was supposed to be on call.", "I have dnd on. Favorites come through.", "Well, the worst has happened multiple times. Almost everyone I know allows parents/children or both to come through at night. Not everyone has the luxury to not be available or is so uncaring about the people in their life. If it works for you, great. But I think you are more likely the outlier, or it is closer to 50/50.", "Of course you don\u2019t, that just makes you a selfish AH imo. How often would you realistically be contacted in the middle of the night? You aren\u2019t losing sleep by being available.", "First, it sounds like she did call  her mother, that's why mother, who was at work, was calling the bf.  My response was to your statement that no one leaves their ringer on.\n\nKeeping a phone on at night wasn't about the 15 year old.   It was about emergencies in general.  Unless there's a very specific reason, my ringer is on at night, though my phone is set to block unknown numbers.   Friends and family know not to call unless it's an emergency, so I don't have to worry about it going off except in an emergency--and middle-of-the-night emergencies have indeed happened.\n\nThere are actually a lot of people who do this or something similar.", "Imagine protecting your health and being called uncaring for it. If the worst happens, call emergency services, not me. There\u2019s nothing I\u2019ll be able to do for you. \n\nThe expectation of being contactable 24-7 is unfair and unrealistic. \n\nYou have situations in your life that you are making space for (sick mom). Most people don\u2019t go to bed thinking, I should leave my phone on in case an anomaly happens and someone needs to call. \n\nAs standard on any iPhone, you can call through DND if you call 3 time within 1 minute.", "I have my phone on DND after 9pm or otherwise I get spam calls or boss\u2019s messages at 3am. After 2 years of waking up and not being able to sleep after these notices, I\u2019ve learned to set my ringer on vibrate and dnd after hours. OP NtA", "I have mine set to contacts only as well. The guy didnt expect to be on call. He\u2019s bc not dad and doesn\u2019t live with them. Some people are heavy sleepers. The mom and her daughter need to work on this issue.", "I would assume the GF is in his contacts and he had his phone completely turned off, from what he wrote.  What if it was a true medical emergency or accident or someone broke into her house or something like that?\n\nI'm not saying he is an AH for not dealing with her daughter (I gave no judgment at all, I think we really don't know enough), it's up to them as a couple to decide their expectations for each other and situations like this, and it sounds like this specific scenario was not something he had agreed to.  My point is that if he spends more nights at her place than his, it seems like they are serious enough that it is not unreasonable for her to expect that he would be reachable."]}
