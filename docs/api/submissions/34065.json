You planned your wedding around your mom not coming. Saying she's not coming so it creates problems for you with the caterer isn't helpful. Why expect a speech? She's rude", "NTA - Sorry your mom ruined your wedding day for you.", "NTA. A wedding is NOT an event where you \u201csurprise\u201d someone. An RSVP is required to make proper accommodations. So sorry you had to deal with this on your wedding day OP.", "NTA. I would still be mad too!", "NTA - Why would you even be? Sorry you had to deal with her", "NTA, this is so crazy it would be funny if it weren't so hurtful.  Can't imagine what went on in her head that she thought this was a good idea, but at least you have your aunt looking out for you.  What was even her excuse for not going to own daughter's wedding in the first place?  Keep that mother at a distance, and she should be grateful for it.", "NTA.

Plus even though there was a set number of RSVPs, I find it hard to believe that there weren't any no shows which is common. Plus when the speeches are said the drinks had already started to flow, so she wouldn't be the only speaker under the influence.", "She said it would cost too much for her to come to the wedding. It was a two hour flight to us. But my husband was livid because she flies back and forth for work a lot so he could not understand why she could not come. Usually, ever since I was a child, I just brush things off when it comes to my mother because there are worse stories I can tell that she has done. But the wedding day was just too much for me. Maybe I just had enough and everything bottled up.", "We decided on a small wedding which consisted only of close family and friends. Everyone RSVPd except my mother. All of the people showed up in the end. All the plans and arrangements went so perfectly until the day before the wedding. I appreciate your viewpoint, but apart from her \"surprising\" us at the wedding and showing up high, she also made trouble with people in her state of being out of it. We expected people to celebrate and have fun but she made fights and even told my husbands grandmother to back off because she doesnt share her children. The level of inappropriateness is what bothered me and still does."]}
