So I that's when I said that the world doesn't revolve around her cat.\n\nEdit: I should add to this post since it's missing some additional info. This is not the first time she's come up to me. Last year, I was asked by her to remove some plants as they are a danger to her cat. She said her cat likes to go outside. I told her sorry, I will not remove my plants as your cat is not allowed to roam freely outdoors. Bylaws ban animals from free roaming off property unless on a leash. She was not happy when I told her that. Claims everyone does it. I told her again I'm sorry but I'm within the law and you aren't when you let your cat outside.", "created_utc": 1694793040, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16jh0pm/aita_m25_for_telling_my_neighbor_the_world_doesnt/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
