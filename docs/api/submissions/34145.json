Being true does not make it not rude. \"Just being honest\" is usually used as a defense for rude behavior.

It *is* rude to just speculate on people's weight as a conversation point. Other people's bodies aren't a proper topic for smalltalk. Also, 'pounders' is a term typically used for catching animals for food. Not just rude, but dehumanizing language to use in reference to anybody.", "YTA\n\nYour mom saying it is one thing, but why would you go to your boyfriend and tell him what your mom said? And look at your wording... \n\n>it was true because they probably are 300 pounds...\n\nYou have no idea if they actually weigh 300 lbs. which means that you are willing to potentially insult someone who only weighs 250 lbs. by pointing out that they look like they weigh 50 lbs. more TO YOU. You and your mother might just be horrible judges of weight AND propriety. And it's true because I say so, which is no less accurate than what you've claimed.", "YTA, both you and your mom. Your mom for saying it, and you for telling your boyfriend. It floors me that people still talk about other people's bodies as if it's small talk AND that people still use the \"I'm just being honest idk why people are mad at me\" excuse.", "YTA. Sometimes thoughts are meant to stay inside your head. This was one of those times."]}
