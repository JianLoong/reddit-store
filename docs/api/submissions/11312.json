When I arrived he happened to be in the lobby. By total fluke, I got a room upgrade. He made a mock \"not fair!\" comment, aimed actually at the clerks not me (in the hope of also scoring one). So I offered to switch, and he scoffed and said \"Don't be daft. Enjoy!\" Same boss, on another trip, had some flight upgrade vouchers left that would expire at the end of the year, and upgraded the entire team travelling with him. I modelled my own boss behaviour after that man when I became one myself, and will be loyal to him until I die.", "NTA.\n\nYou need to make her aware that the upgrade was a frequent flyer perk, and she could try it too if she wants.", "NTA unless this is written on paper in the books that you always give your boss the better things, she's being entitled.

There is no \"protocol\" when it comes to upgrades based on your personal credit card. She is a selfish a-hole that should have been happy you had a good flight. What a bad manager.
