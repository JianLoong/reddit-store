Could you show me where it is so I can better familiarize myself with company protocol?\u201d\n\nNTA", "NTA- but if you want to kiss up to the boss\u2026", "She is way out of line, and the statement that there is a \"protocol\" is BS. Upgrades are a crapshoot at the best of times, and have nothing to do with who paid for the ticket (if it did, HINT: she did not). \n\nHere's what real bosses do:  My boss and I stayed in the same hotel during a business trip, but arrived on different flights as I had already been elsewhere. When I arrived he happened to be in the lobby. By total fluke, I got a room upgrade. He made a mock \"not fair!\" comment, aimed actually at the clerks not me (in the hope of also scoring one). So I offered to switch, and he scoffed and said \"Don't be daft. Enjoy!\" Same boss, on another trip, had some flight upgrade vouchers left that would expire at the end of the year, and upgraded the entire team travelling with him. I modelled my own boss behaviour after that man when I became one myself, and will be loyal to him until I die.", "NTA.\n\nYou need to make her aware that the upgrade was a frequent flyer perk, and she could try it too if she wants.", "NTA unless this is written on paper in the books that you always give your boss the better things, she's being entitled. You have no obligation to give your boss special treatment.", "NTA, your boss tried to screw you out of **your** upgrade, IMO you should report that to HR", "nta", "NTA, and since she seems to not get into trouble after HR complaints cc HR and management both, if she targets you after that cc even more people with the complaints.", "NTA sounds like she\u2019s trying to abuse her power and should maybe be reported to HR if this intensifies.", "NTA but I do think it was unwise to accept the upgrade as people are douches and this was sort of inevitable (not that it should be - just that it is)", "NTA. There is no \"protocol\" when it comes to upgrades based on your personal credit card. She is a selfish a-hole that should have been happy you had a good flight. What a bad manager. In fact, I wouldn't accept an upgrade from someone reporting to me if it was based on their own miles. Find a new job!", "NTA I would start looking for another job or transfer out of her department", "Wow. NTA. I\u2019d report her to HR.", "NTA,", "Your boss has balls bigger than Mt Rushmore and an ego to match.   \nNTA\n\nEven in big Pharma that would not fly.", "NTA - had a boss just like this once.  Have now passed her significantly.  If I travel with anyone on my team I go out of my way to make sure they have the best experience possible.", "OP=YTA because you can't even get your post straight\n\nYou wrote first <<*use their credit card, so I often get free upgrades to first class*\\>>  \nthen wrote<<*While the company paid for my seat, it\u2019s my own personal credit card spending??*\\>>     \nIs it their credit card or yours?  And even so, if the miles are accrued because THEY are paying for your travel, then it was at least FOOLISH on your part not to offer her the seat.  \n\nIt would have helped if SHE had let you know beforehand, but next time consider that Bum-kissing goes a LONG way in the real world.", "NTA but not smart either. How long was the flight? Would it have killed you to kiss ass a little? I'd have offered it to her in the hope that it showed up in my next raise.", "Smart.", "Plus I don't know that the airline would honor the upgrade if OP gave it to someone else. Probably, but there is the possibility the airline would just go to the next person on the upgrade list.", "She's 7, and assumes OP to be 5, so she gets the front seat because she's the oldest", "The protocol of \"complete lack of integrity\".  Good leaders do not demand that their staff give up personal benefits.  They say \"good for you, enjoy the upgrade\".", "I worked for a guy who would throw a massive tantrum if he didn't get a gift card from the entire staff for Christmas. Employees, most of who were making under $12/hr, had to contribute $15 or feel the wrath of the office manager. In return we would get a company uniform shirt sometimes.", "I think it is still a better idea to ask HR where the protocol is documented.  Tangling with the boss on this adds extra risk for OP's situation.", "Thank you!! This is my first corporate gig, so I have no idea what is valid to talk to HR about, if it\u2019s not like\u2026overt sexual harassment or something like that.", "I am definitely looking and this has only added fuel to my fire!!", "You need to add that the miles are associated with your personal credit card and non-company travel. She demanding that you give her a personal asset, not a business one", "Red flag coming from a red flag. Boss can\u2019t try pulling rank like that to begin with and definitely not when it\u2019s your personal spending that got you the upgrade. Plus if they like retaliating against complaints then they should be getting fired on the spot soon as proof is presented\n\nTotally would love to see an update on boss lady getting de-bossed", "DO this.   OP paid for the credit card, and all the charges, banked points, and SPENT points.  \"Boss\" had the option of spending points or CASH based on their situation, so this was in fact Boss attempting to BULLY subordinate into a financial payment based on having authority over subordinate.  Or, if there are real consequences, extortion (?) - whether the penalties are stated or not.  (Bad performance review, necessary resources blocked, bonuses withheld...) \n\nYWNBTA to contact HR per gilded\\_lady comment, IF there are any witnesses to this conversation.  If not, quickly write a log as best OP can of the time, date, location, and who said exactly what.  Use quotes if possible.  If so, do that, and notes the witnesses (airline staff,   \\*\\*After\\*\\* doing that, ASK HR what would be the correct steps in the event such an exchange did happen?  That may be a good way to test the reaction of HR.\n\n>She has retaliated against other employees\n\nA complaint here and there can be covered up.  Several employees with individually written records, including overt retaliation and witnesses, carries much more weight -  although a great company would have taken the first report very seriously.\n\nConsider what the preferred and acceptable outcome would be for this situation - new manager? Corrected behavior? Switching departments?", "I doubt they would.  I suppose you could swap seats mid flight.", "Switching seats... people do this all the time. Don't need to get approval from airline.", "I got a $10 Starbucks card from my boss (it's a non-profit).  I didn't get her anything!", "THIS !", "Yes. I'm looking forward to the boss terminated. Or written up.", "Of course they do. Perhaps it\u2019s because they have an \u201cundiscovered relationship\u201d\u2026"]}
