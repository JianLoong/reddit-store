The only possible way they could have qualified for an upgrade due to your finances, would be if you used your card to book the bosses ticket, which you didn't. As it stands, if the only connection they had to your perks was being your boss, and it's probable that the airline wouldn't have transferred the upgrade to boss even if you had requested it - a spouse, maybe. But it is totally inappropriate & entitled for your boss to assume you could/should pass your personal perks on to them just because your company paid for the initial tickets. If you'd gone for lunch during the trip and you had a loyalty-card with credit so decided to splurge on a nice meal using your points to pay for the amount over and above your food stipend, would the boss have a tantrum and expect you to put it towards their meal rather than your own?
