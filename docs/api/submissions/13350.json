My 31 year old sister is pretty self sufficient & does everything as an adult should. My 25 year old sister is the complete opposite of us. She expects everything to be handed to her & gets upset if you don\u2019t. Well this past November her son who was getting off the bus at my house after school because she was \u201cworking\u201d was banned from my house. He was banned because a vase that I received from my grandmother was broken & neither him nor my oldest son would say who did it. This was the final straw for me. A little back story, at the time I was working from home & was a supervisor & would often have to take over calls for upset members. Well one member reported me because they could hear someone calling me auntie over & over & felt as though I wasn\u2019t listening to them because of the child in the background. Well this almost got me fired as the company was very strict. So back to it, when I told my sister about the vase & that her son could no longer get off the bus at my house & she needed to make other arrangements she said her son said \u201che didn\u2019t do it\u201d so he would be getting off the bus at my house still. This infuriated me so I told her that if she wasn\u2019t going to get her son off the bus that he would be sitting outside waiting for her to get off work because he was not welcome at my house. To that she responded by getting on social media and saying that anybody that leaves my child out in the cold is dead to me. Yes it was November, but we live in Louisiana, it was literally 80 degrees outside that week. So instead of letting her son continue to come to my house I started taking my lunch break late & picking my son up from school knowing that the bus driver would not let my sisters kid off the bus at my house if my car wasn\u2019t there & my son wasn\u2019t on the bus. The bus driver instead would take him back to the school & my sister was called to come get him (which she always did with her boyfriend\u2019s kids in the car but she was supposed to be at work) after a few days the bus driver started to let her son off at our older sister house which did not work either because he doesn\u2019t like to listen. So our mom called a family meeting & i let my little sister know exactly how I felt. I told her that I\u2019m her sister, not her mom, not her man & I\u2019m tired of feeling used & abused by her because she calls me for everything. Police gets called to her house multiple different times & she calls me in the middle of the night to come get her kids so CPS doesn\u2019t come take them but that\u2019s another story. I pretty much had had it & just lashed out & released all feelings & emotions at once. She was speechless & got up & left after I finished & we haven\u2019t spoken since, AITA?", "created_utc": 1679941796, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/123vsl6/aita_for_refusing_to_help_with_my_sister_with_her/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her job is not more important than yours just because you work from home", "\"But that's another story\", no, thats exactly this story.

That she left speechless speaks volumes, no pun intended.", "NTA. Your sister seems to have \"worn out her welcome\" so to speak. You are correct- you are not her mom, man or children's father.

It could cost you your job.  Enough said.  \n\nSeems to me like she needs to step up and be a better parent.", "Notify the school that you are not caring for your nephew even if your car is there and dropping him off at your house will result in the police being notified that they abandoned a child at the wrong bus stop.", "The police were being called because her & her bf were always fighting. Either she would call them or her bf would call them on her. The kids were always in there room asleep but if she got arrested were are the kids supposed to go. The police here would rather release them to family then have to call CPS in cases like this & that came directly from a police on the scene one night.", "So i did leave that part out. I didn\u2019t blame him. Ik my son was in there too & he could\u2019ve possibly broke it it\u2019s the simple fact that i have to always say something to him multiple times when he\u2019s here because he refuses to listen. The vase being broke was just it for me because it was a gift from my grandma that can\u2019t be replaced", "honestly,that doesnt really matter.op doesnt want to deal withsis and nephew and thats her right", "It's not really about the vase, though, is it? If it's not convenient for OP to care for the kid and it's jeopardized her job, sis doesn't have the right to dump him there anyway, and OP has every right to step away after sis has been consistently irresponsible and expecting OP to bail her out of the consequences of her poor parenting at all hours.", "Thank goodness that\u2019s all it was. I don\u2019t mean to belittle what the kids and you are dealing with but I was afraid it was something far worse.", "It is not about the vase, but it also is\u2026 Blaming someone without knowing if they actually did something is not cool. But also like you said, it\u2019s not ok to dump your kid and expect someone else to take care of them. So biggest AH is OPs sister, followed by OP (to a lesser extent) IMHO"]}
