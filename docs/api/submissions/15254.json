Tom\u2019s mom died when he was a toddler, and his father couldn\u2019t take care of him; Tom spent his childhood in foster care and hasn\u2019t seen his dad since he was six years old. When I asked him why he hasn\u2019t found out where his dad is since being an adult, Tom said he didn\u2019t want to know and doesn\u2019t care. \n\nBut I could see the sadness in his eyes, and I think he does want to know at the very least if his dad is still alive. Finding people is what I do for a living, and so I have started researching from the very details I got from Tom, and was planning to tell him once I got solid information. I had no intentions of contacting this man, or telling him about Tom. \n\nBut last night I was talking to my older sister (35F) on the phone and when I mentioned how I was researching Tom\u2019s biological father she called me an AH and said I was invading his privacy. WIBTA if I go through with it and find out if my boyfriend\u2019s dad is still alive? \n\nTLDR; my boyfriend hasn\u2019t had his father in his life since he was six years old and I want to find him despite bf saying he doesn\u2019t want to know.", "created_utc": 1681995646, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12sxw2m/wibta_if_i_find_my_boyfriends_estranged_father/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Please stop watching 90's Hallmark channel movies.\n\nOP, you don't know how awful this person was to him, and it's his right to keep it private. It could have been a very abusive situation. There are some horrifying cases of abuse and neglect. Whatever happened with this father was bad enough that your BF was placed elsewhere. Imagine if his father sexually abused him, horribly beat him, tortured or neglected him, or just told him he didn't want to keep him. Now imagine you bring this father over for pizza and root beer. \n\nYou could ruin your boyfriend's life by not only retraumatizing him, but making sure an unsafe person knows where he lives and other personal info.

If you do this, you are risking your relationship ending because it would be a great betrayal of trust and I would even call it borderline abusive as it violates his autonomy (which is not a word I use often). I agree with your sister as well.", "HUGE YWBTA. That would end your relationship I promise.", "Wtf is wrong with you?  You're about to open pandoras box bc you know best for your bf of 8 months.

Why would you choose to be so blatantly disrespectful to your BF after he very clearly told you he doesn't want anything to do with his dad?

It is not up to you to interpret what you think his eyes are saying and this is none of your business. YTA.", "YTA.  I feel you are well intentioned, but Tom has said that he doesn't want to know, so if you research this behind his back, you are not respecting him.

Perhaps due to the difficult live he got because of his dad?", "YTA, respect his wishes and leave this alone. Nothing good will come of this.", "YTA because this isn\u2019t about you. Your partner also said no, it just seems like finding the dad is a self fulfilling desire. \n\nsaviorism is not cool.", "YTA and dumb af", "Yes YWBTA. Op I know you love your bf and what you want to do comes from that love but it's completely and totally HIS decision. You're ignoring his wishes if you find his dad. Maybe wait some time and have another convo and see if he changes his mind.", "YWBTA  \nThat is your boyfriend's father who hasn't been in touch since Tom was six.  \nHe has a proper reason to not care about it and is probably just sad about it.  \nDoesn't mean you should start looking for his father.  \nJust leave the matter be.", "This very question has been asked before but always from the past tense.

If you want to help him get through this kind of trauma you can also recommend therapy.", "He literally said he doesn't want to know.

It makes you look like a selfish asshole. YTA", "YTA. \n\nTom explicitly told you he doesn't know and doesn't care.

That sadness you mentioned could\u2019ve easily meant something else.. you just assumed one reason. Why did it only mean he \u201cwanted\u201d to see his biological father?

What part of No didn\u2019t you understand? He could have looked sad as it was a painful part of his life . Could be , like myself, mourns the regular childhood I never had. But that doesn\u2019t mean he or I wants a reunion with our fathers . What makes you the expert on what he wants ? After 8 months ? Please . Stop this right now and don\u2019t do another thing.

He's also told you point-blank he doesn't want to know.\n\nI don't know my biological father and I don't want to. I once had a friend that's adopted tell me that as I get older, I'll want to know.

It\u2019s normal to be sad about not having the relationship, similar to how a person feels sad when they end a romantic relationship with someone they truly loved but know they just can\u2019t make a relationship work for various reasons. You need to respect your partner\u2019s choice not to seek out this person. Ask yourself why the father hasn\u2019t made any effort to seek out your partner. Maybe put yourself in his shoes for a minute and ask yourself honestly how you would feel if one of your parents passed away and the other one not only \u201ccouldn\u2019t\u201d take care of you, but also made zero effort to even be in your life for nearly 30 years.

You are probably fine with the relationship you have with your parents and are of the mindset that you would want to know, but you haven't been raised with the knowledge that your dad abandoned you. \n\nLeave it alone, if he knows that you know how to skip trace and wants to find his dad he will tell you. \n\nThere are tons of stories of partners thinking they know better are about their other half's feeling about their estranged parents and it blows up in their face.

I'm estranged from my father, and I mourn the loss of the relationship and what the relationship should have been while knowing that the estrangement is the best scenario for me. And honestly, it's a little easier for me to cope by not knowing where, why, or how he is. Knowing that information would put pressure on your bf to do something with that information, and it sounds like he's already developed his own coping mechanism or come to terms with it.\n\nYou're better off, if you feel strongly about it, just saying to him \"well, if you ever decide you want to know more, I'm happy to help you do the research to find him\" and leaving it at that.

Is that your goal? YTA", "\"Me, Me, Me.\" You said he doesn't want this but you do, it's not your place but you don't care. You're being horribly selfish and your only justification is that you think you know him better than he knows himself. \n\nYour self-absorbed hero complex will absolutely Nuke your relationship.

It's endearing that you want to do a good thing for him,  but it might not be the right thing for him.", "I think maybe before you dig any further you stop and ask your partner if hes okay with you doing that. Depending how he reacts maybe you could find the info so IF he chooses to look into it he can when hes ready, or if he really says no then you drop it immediately. \nI know you mean well, but the truth is you dont know why his dad is around, and it could be for not good reasons. \nPlease talk to him first and be honest.

Tom\u2019s mom died when he was a toddler, and his father couldn\u2019t take care of him; Tom spent his childhood in foster care and hasn\u2019t seen his dad since he was six years old. When I asked him why he hasn\u2019t found out where his dad is since being an adult, Tom said he didn\u2019t want to know and doesn\u2019t care. \n\nBut I could see the sadness in his eyes, and I think he does want to know at the very least if his dad is still alive. Finding people is what I do for a living, and so I have started researching from the very details I got from Tom, and was planning to tell him once I got solid information. I had no intentions of contacting this man, or telling him about Tom. \n\nBut last night I was talking to my older sister (35F) on the phone and when I mentioned how I was researching Tom\u2019s biological father she called me an AH and said I was invading his privacy. WIBTA if I go through with it and find out if my boyfriend\u2019s dad is still alive? \n\nTLDR; my boyfriend hasn\u2019t had his father in his life since he was six years old and I want to find him despite bf saying he doesn\u2019t want to know.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
