Tom\u2019s mom died when he was a toddler, and his father couldn\u2019t take care of him; Tom spent his childhood in foster care and hasn\u2019t seen his dad since he was six years old. When I asked him why he hasn\u2019t found out where his dad is since being an adult, Tom said he didn\u2019t want to know and doesn\u2019t care. \n\nBut I could see the sadness in his eyes, and I think he does want to know at the very least if his dad is still alive. Finding people is what I do for a living, and so I have started researching from the very details I got from Tom, and was planning to tell him once I got solid information. I had no intentions of contacting this man, or telling him about Tom. \n\nBut last night I was talking to my older sister (35F) on the phone and when I mentioned how I was researching Tom\u2019s biological father she called me an AH and said I was invading his privacy. WIBTA if I go through with it and find out if my boyfriend\u2019s dad is still alive? \n\nTLDR; my boyfriend hasn\u2019t had his father in his life since he was six years old and I want to find him despite bf saying he doesn\u2019t want to know.", "created_utc": 1681995646, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12sxw2m/wibta_if_i_find_my_boyfriends_estranged_father/", "score": 427, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Please stop watching 90's Hallmark channel movies.\n\nOP, you don't know how awful this person was to him, and it's his right to keep it private. It could have been a very abusive situation. There are some horrifying cases of abuse and neglect. Whatever happened with this father was bad enough that your BF was placed elsewhere. Imagine if his father sexually abused him, horribly beat him, tortured or neglected him, or just told him he didn't want to keep him. Now imagine you bring this father over for pizza and root beer. \n\nYou could ruin your boyfriend's life by not only retraumatizing him, but making sure an unsafe person knows where he lives and other personal info.

If you do this, you are risking your relationship ending because it would be a great betrayal of trust and I would even call it borderline abusive as it violates his autonomy (which is not a word I use often).

It is not up to you to interpret what you think his eyes are saying and this is none of your business. YTA.", "YTA.  I feel you are well intentioned, but Tom has said that he doesn't want to know, so if you research this behind his back, you are not respecting him.

Perhaps due to the difficult live he got because of his dad?", "YTA, respect his wishes and leave this alone. Nothing good will come of this.", "YTA because this isn\u2019t about you. Your partner also said no, it just seems like finding the dad is a self fulfilling desire. \n\nsaviorism is not cool.", "YTA and dumb af", "Yes YWBTA. Op I know you love your bf and what you want to do comes from that love but it's completely and totally HIS decision. You're ignoring his wishes if you find his dad. Maybe wait some time and have another convo and see if he changes his mind.", "YWBTA  \nThat is your boyfriend's father who hasn't been in touch since Tom was six.  \nHe has a proper reason to not care about it and is probably just sad about it.  \nDoesn't mean you should start looking for his father.  \nJust leave the matter be.", "This very question has been asked before but always from the past tense.

If you want to help him get through this kind of trauma you can also recommend therapy.", "He literally said he doesn't want to know.

It makes you look like a selfish asshole. YTA", "YTA. \n\nTom explicitly told you he doesn't know and doesn't care.

Tom\u2019s mom died when he was a toddler, and his father couldn\u2019t take care of him; Tom spent his childhood in foster care and hasn\u2019t seen his dad since he was six years old. When I asked him why he hasn\u2019t found out where his dad is since being an adult, Tom said he didn\u2019t want to know and doesn\u2019t care. \n\nBut I could see the sadness in his eyes, and I think he does want to know at the very least if his dad is still alive. Finding people is what I do for a living, and so I have started researching from the very details I got from Tom, and was planning to tell him once I got solid information. I had no intentions of contacting this man, or telling him about Tom. \n\nBut last night I was talking to my older sister (35F) on the phone and when I mentioned how I was researching Tom\u2019s biological father she called me an AH and said I was invading his privacy.

One, you are second guessing and patronising your boyfriend, and generally disrespecting him and his explicitly stated wish.

Maybe he was just sad at the thought of his father - you know, the man that abandoned him and was responsible for his crappy childhood.\n\nSecondly, and more importantly, you will be pushing the issue beyond what your boyfriend may be comfortable with. Clearly, you already do not respect boundaries.  Who knows how you will present this to him, and if you will passive aggressively push it on him to meet etc. Even just presenting him with information puts him in a bind, because simply not knowing may be a blissful ignorance, but now knowing that you have a solid lead, he will have to deal with doing something about it, or not doing something when he could.

This is an extremely personal and sensitive matter and isn't something a girlfriend of 8 months that just recently had the family conversation should be meddling in.

You don't even sound like you can even begin to fully grasp what a childhood like that does to a person. Let's say you *did* find him- you're picturing the moment you give your boyfriend the news, thinking he's going to be all warm and happy and appreciative of all your hard work, or maybe you picture him sobbing happy tears and telling you he secretly always wanted to find him so on and so fourth. But that's a fairy tale ending and also the least likely outcome. Do you have any idea what it feels like to find out the person who was supppsed to love you, protect you, give you hugs, fix you up when you fall off that two wheeler and scrape your knee, tuck you in at night and check under your bed for monsters and all those other seemingly small things that children with even just a mom or just a dad, or grandparents/godparents-literally anyone that truly loves them- takes for granted-is the same person that abandoned you and let you go into one of the most fckd up systems-where 90% of children are abused, used as pawns to collect a check while wearing old clothes that often don't fit properly but they're all the kid has because all their belongings have to fit into a single black garbage bag at any given moment and *new* clothes are a privilege-not a right- had a whole life without you? Maybe they got married and had more children, children they loved, children that got birthday parties and presents, and new clothes and shoes for school, children that got their own rooms, their own beds, children that knew exactly where they belonged every night when they closed their eyes to go to sleep, children that knew they were safe and protected- do you know how worthless that makes one feel? How lonely it is? How many times they wonder silently why they weren't good enough? What they did wrong? Or maybe you find the dad but it's too late, he's passed away- that can be even worse because there's no answers to all those questions that kept that innocent child up at night. Or maybe dad never changed and is a horrible person. You simply don't know. And it's not up to you to find out. Your boyfriend didn't have a happy childhood, and he's more than likely experienced a lot of trauma. If he one day chooses to go down that path and find his dad, he should do it with the help and support of a therapist that specializes in childhood trauma and abandonment. No matter how great your intentions are- the fact you have went behind his back, against his wishes is a clear indication you are not mature enough to handle the storm that may come from your actions.

Turns out she never wanted to see her family again, after her brother raped a younger girl and said girl committing suicide. Her family backed her brother so she went no contact. Didn't even want to talk about them. The OP  in that story screwed up and I think he ended up single. This op could find themselves in the same situation if they cross anymore boundaries", "Yeah, that fox said he didn't want those grapes.", "It's worse than that, because it's not a case where dad was just entirely absent, OP mentioned that her boyfriend was *taken* from his dad when he was six. So it's probably more a case of \"my dad was an actively abusive/neglectful asshole and I *really* would just rather pretend that he died like my mom did\".", "It\u2019s like setting off a little bomb in someone\u2019s life. Now he gets to deal with the emotional upheaval of whatever the fuck this turns into.", "I wish RIF let me Gold this comment.", "YWBTA.\n\nWhat about \"No, I don't want to find/know about/meet my father\" didn't register with you?  What gives you the right to defy his wishes because YOU don't agree with them?\n\nIf you do this, he will never speak to you again, and rightfully so. Is that what you want?", "YTA. replacer his boundaries!

It\u2019s not your right. You do not get to do this. You\u2019re violating your boyfriend\u2019s trust if you do it. You\u2019re going to invite *so* much drama and hurt into his life if you do this. It\u2019s going to be so internally conflicting. You don\u2019t need to be his hero; he doesn\u2019t need to be fixed or saved. Leave well enough alone. Don\u2019t do it.\n\nYTA / YWBTA", "YTA\n\nIt's NONE of your business! He said he doesn't want to know him. Why the fuck are you going against what he wants?", "Haven't seen or want to see my dad for over 30 years. A lot of people with dads in their lives can't imagine not wanting to see thier dad. you're projecting your feelings about father's onto your boyfriend. \n\nThis person is a stranger to your boyfriend, no history, no familiar bonds but worse than a true stranger, this is someone who could have made an effort years ago to be a part of his life and willingly chose not to.  Willingly left a child to find his way in the world alone.  Reintroducing this person into your boyfriends life will not improve your boyfriends life or happiness in any way. \n\nYwbta if you do this.", "As someone who has been in Tom\u2019s situation, YWBTA. So much so that I would consider whether I really wanted to waste any more time with someone who couldn\u2019t respect basic boundaries. Your boyfriend knows what you do for a living. He\u2019ll ask if he wants your help. Also\u2014my bio dad did finally reach out to me when I was an adult. I chose not to see him. He has since passed away and I still have zero regrets. Not everyone needs a Lifetime movie drama in their life.", "YTA, as someone with an estranged father if a partner of mine decided to go and find him because they think they know my mindset and emotions better than myself you\u2019d be gone so quick. \n\nBeing estranged from someone whether they\u2019re family or not is for a reason. Finding his father is like a cute lil project for you and will cause so much emotional distress to your bf. I would stop now while you\u2019re ahead, your sister is correct.", "\u201cI have no intention of contacting this man,\u201d so it\u2019s just for your own nosiness? Because once you find out who he is/where he is, I feel like you\u2019ll find a different excuse to dump this information on Tom whether he likes it or not. \n\nOr, alternately, you can put yourself in a situation where you know something about Tom\u2019s father that Tom doesn\u2019t want to know, and then you have to just hold that information inside no matter what for the rest of your relationship, no matter how tempted you get. A massive secret, linked to his childhood trauma, that you\u2019ll have to keep quiet about forever, maybe even lie about. You\u2019re eight months in, why sabotage the relationship like this? The only way to win is not to play.", "YTA. He said he doesn't know, doesn't care. Maybe he IS sad about it but he clearly knows you find people for a living. If he wants you to find him, he will ask. This is not your business.", "Why do I get the feeling you will ignore all the YWBTAs and will go ahead and then make a post in a month or two complaining about how your boyfriend dumped you after this \"nice\" thing you did", "YTA. A massive one.", "I am estranged from my mother and if I found out a partner was attempting to find her i would dump them immediately.\n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nPlease tell Tom. He deserves to know about your betrayal.", "Tom deserves a lot better than to have his girlfriend go behind his back and against his instruction to dig up unnecessary drama from 26 years ago. Honestly if I read my partner was doing something like this I'd dump them for being so disrespectful and stubborn. YTA.", "YTA, I'm basically going to be saying the same thing other people here have been saying which is to 'Stop'. Now, I can tell, you probably have good intentions but if your bf has stated before that he does not want to know and does not care about him, there's a pretty high chance that he doesn't want to know. Plus, if he does, should he be the one to do the research on his dad? Also, didn't you ever stop to think that there's reasons as to why your bf doesn't want to see his dad? I'm saying this again, for the love of God, stop for the good of him and your relationship.", "YTA. Stop searching immediately. It's not your business and you could end up hurting him.", "YTA and if he finds out what you are doing he will, rightfully, dump you. Not your place at ALL.", "YTA. Not your family. Not your business.", "YTA.\n\nAbsolutely do NOT do this.\nIt is NOT your place to do it, you are massively overstepping.\n\nYou have this romantic, idyllic notion that you're going to facilitate a hallmark movie reunion.\n\nIn reality, you're going to cause your boyfriend trauma and angst, destroy his trust in you, and probably end your relationship.\n\nYou can support your boyfriend in what he wants to do, but you thinking you know better and overriding his express wishes is arrogant, and completely out of line, and will totally blow up in your face.", "YTA. You\u2019re making HUGE assumptions. \u201cI could see the sadness in his eyes\u201d my ass. Maybe he\u2019s sad because his dad sucked. You can not read his mind. You do not know better than he does. \nSomething like this should never, never be a surprise. You, as Tom\u2019s partner, should be open to supporting HIM if and when HE decides to reach out to his father. To do so on your own, explicitly against Tom\u2019s wishes, is a massive overstep and you would absolutely be the AH.", "YTA for even considering it. What on earth do you think gives you the right to do such a thing? \"Not your place\" doesn't even begin to cover it. What an absolutely gross thing to do.", "You're the asshole for ignoring your boyfriend's wishes", "If OP does this, more than likely she will lose her boyfriend. He has set a boundary and she needs to respect it. \n\nOP, you are TA.", "Not to mention that OP's bf surely knows what OP does for a living, so if the bf wants to find his dad, he knows he can ask OP for help.", "Or perhaps because of the difficult life that he lived with his dad before whatever his dad did that got him removed with no visitation? \nHe remembers that time and he does not want to go there. YWBTA.", "No, OP didn\u2019t mean good.  OP has main character syndrome.", "Tom knows OP could find his father.  Tom did not ask OP to find his father.  When OP asked Tom if he wanted to find his father, Tom said No.  It doesn\u2019t get any clearer than that.\n\nOP is not doing this as a gift for Tom.  OP is doing this because they\u2019ve got a massive case of main character syndrome.  OP is the AH.", "And when Tom finds out OP did this, AND HE WILL FIND OUT, it will DESTROY his trust in OP, as well it should.", "Tom knows that OP could find his father.  Tom did not ask OP to find his father.  When OP offered to find his father, Tom said No.  It\u2019s as simple as that.  Even just trying to find him is a MASSIVE breach of Tom\u2019s trust.

And Tom WILL find out someday.", "And it's like... even if OP doesn't actively bring dad over, pretty sure that most methods of looking for that information also involve putting out information that others can find in turn. So even if OP is true to her word and not trying to force contact it could lead to unwanted contact anyway.", "My brother said he didn't want it either. I could tell he really did want to know though. \n\nLike it or not, sometimes other people know what is best for us. Just gotta be willing to accept the viewpoint. \n\nThe problem with this sub is that it makes personal choice the only option. If you go against someone's choice you are BAD, according to AITA anyway.", "There is no mention of this conversation. Just asking why they haven\u2019t looked.", "YTA.  He told you he doesn't want to find him.  Listen to the words coming out of his mouth, not the sadness you think you see in his eyes.  Not all these family reunions are happy.  He has the right to make the choice to risk that or not on his own.", "YTA if you mention it to Tom. He outright said he didn\u2019t want to know. Poking around at this uninvited is one-shot break up material. Drop it, don\u2019t mention it and forget it ever happened.", ">But I could see the sadness in his eyes, and I think he does want to know at the very least if his dad is still alive.\n\nJesus fuck\n\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nStay out of his business on this matter if you want him to remain in a relationship with you.", "YWIBTA. Don\u2019t go behind his back and do research. Eight months is not that long yet, family wil come up again obviously, if you see that sadness again ask him about his feelings. Ask him to tell you about it, but don\u2019t push. Listen, respond. After that mention that you\u2019re good at finding people, offer to do so but clearly state that he doesn\u2019t have to say yes or can change is mind and always ask you to find him anyway or to stop finding him. That either way you\u2019ll support him throughout what he needs and wants, and will be there still if those needs/wants change. You\u2019ll support him if he wants to open up but also will be there for him if he can\u2019t or doesn\u2019t want to talk about it.\n\nDon\u2019t try to fix things without his say.

YTA.", "YWBTA\n\nLook OP, I don't believe for a second you \"see the sadness in his eyes\", and if you did I still don't believe you read it correctly. Even then, he explicitly said no. You're hardly the first person to become overly obsessed with their SO's estranged family, muchless the first girlfriend to think she knows better about how to manage her boyfriends social circle because you see yourself as more emotionally mature or some shit. Don't think you're doing a favour, that this is going to be a hallmark moment, because it isn't and it won't be.", "Gentle YTA. You're coming from a place of love but it's not something that you surpise on someone. \n\nAsk Tom if he would like you to look because it's what you do, and keep it as an open ended offer.", "YTA, i wish my sperm donors ex partner had never found me. He abandoned us when i was 2 and then abandoned my other siblings when they were 1, 8 and 12. I had to grieve again when he yet again abandoned me as a 27yo.

It is not your place to interfere and you will lose your relationship because of your refusal to respect your BF's expressed wish NOT.TO.KNOW.", "You watch too many movies. In real life the result is he suddenly despises you and breaks up with you. \n\nYWBTA", "YTA.", "Go ahead if you can get him to change his. It is his decision. He might have reasons he has not told you about, he would not be required to. You could end up single.", "What's sickening is that OP is a mama's boy and listened to his mom, instead of communicating with his ex about why she was estranged from her side of the family. What was worse was that mom dismissed the horrible abuse that the ex's older brother had done to her best friend's younger sister, which led to her unaliving herself.\n\n\"It happened years ago. She needs to get over it.\" I was flabbergasted from that sentence.", "> who knows maybe in a few years homie will change his mind and you can just pull the file out and hand over the information when he\u2019s ready.\n\nYeah, because his girlfriend pulling out a full file on his dad the second he says he's looking into it isn't going to freak him right the fuck out.", ">  If you go against someone's choice you are BAD\n\nUh yeah. Personal autonomy is *pretty fucking important*.", "Not a single one of us has true personal choice. \n\nI believe there are too many self centered people today, unwilling to accept advice or outside help unless we ask and that, to me, is a very bad way to live.\n\nI am who I am because the experiences I have had in life.
