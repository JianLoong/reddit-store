I didn't outright introduce her to my so (m15) for several reasons. One of them being that my son is an introvert and has trouble with meeting new people and adjusting to new routines and places. Tamara kept insisting on meeting him, even tried to show \"by accident\" in places that me and my son were several times and would try to speak to him. Her reason for that is that the sooner my son meets her, the better her chance would be to make him get used to her as a mother figure. I told her we weren't even engaged yet so she needed to slow down.\n\n\nThey finally met a month ago. They get along well but Tamara would get mad at the slightest mistake my son makes. She'd say \"he knows that I don't like this or that\". I tried to explain that my son does not know her that well but she keeps insisting on \"teaching him\".\n\n\n\nDays ago, we went togather to eat at a restaurant. We were eating and suddenly, she yelled at my son no to leave his fork outside the plate. I must say, it was an embarrassing moment for me as well as my son. She yelled and scolded him so loud the whole restaurant heard. I immediately yelled at her to stop treating my son like she was his mom. It got more awkward and she looked at me stunned for a minute then got up suddenly and went to the restroom. She later left from there and sent me a text talking about how I hurt her feelings and humiliated her in public when she was just trying to \"teach my son\" some manners that I \"clearly didn't teach him\" after his mom passed away. We got into a fight and she has been expecting an apology from me.

NTA for yelling but you suck for putting your som through this so far, you say they get on but are you sure your introverted son is just not staying quiet.", "NTA What a loon, she got upset enough over a very minor etiquette thing that she decided that the best way to fix it was by behaving in one of the most rude ways possible by screaming in a restaurant?  \n\nHer outburst was a way way bigger social fuck up than the thing she was trying to fix.", "Who the hell thinks this is the way to interact with your boyfriend's teenage child? Even without the restaurant incident. \n\nOp please tell us you dumped her. Why didn't you stop the nagging before?", "Pushing to meet your son after only being together a short time. \ud83d\udea9\nShowing up unannounced to try and force a meeting. \ud83d\udea9\nAlready trying to set the stage as a mother figure for your son before she has even met him. \ud83d\udea9\n\nDude she gave you plenty of chances to break this off before it got to this point and you ignored them. You are NTA for yelling at her cause that\u2019s exactly what I would have done. But if you continue this relationship after she waved around all these red flags you will absolutely be an asshole - to yourself and your so.", "Good for you protecting your son! NTA", "NTA. I hope you don\u2019t have bunnies.", "NTA.\n\nYour girlfriend, though I hope she's now your ex, is the a******. She is not his mother therefore she has no right to discipline him it doesn't matter that you guys have been together for 8 months that doesn't give her the right to try and teach him something when she has no say in how he's taught. Your, hopefully, ex gives off so many red flags that she have a time out called on her by a referee. Seriously... dump her and take your son out to celebrate.", "Run.", "I think it's interesting that she was \"humiliated\" by you yelling at her in public, but she literally was just doing that to your son? That right there tells me she knows that she's humiliating your son in public but doesn't care and thinks he deserves it. \n\nYou're not the asshole at all for standing up for your kid and giving her a taste of her own medicine. However, you will be the asshole if you stay with this disrespectful woman. Choose your kid.", "She's psycho. What is wrong with you?", "YWBTA if you stayed with her. You've only been dating 8 months and she wants your 15 year old son to see her as a mother figure?", "NTA. Dude she stalked you just to meet your son after you told her he wasn\u2019t ready. She then proceeds to parent him which you did not tell her she could do. The red flags are right in front of your face. Run.", "NTA, I'd break up with her. She's just going to get worse from here. She clearly has no respect for boundaries. You absolutely were doing what is best for your son. Keep doing that and you're golden.", "NTA.  Break up with her, block her, and protect your son.  She is dangerous.", "NTA, dump her because you can expect if you apologize and keep the relationship you\u2019re gonna have to deal with a lot more than yelling/scolding.", "ESH. \n\nShe attempted to force her way into your son\u2019s life despite you asking her not to. She gets mad at slight mistakes. She is overstepping by leaps and bounds here and it is not going to stop, it\u2019s going to get get worse, because she is not respecting the boundaries you are setting and you are letting her do that. \n\nYou need to stop seeing her because she is not acting responsible or stable and you are exposing your son to that.", "Brother, how many more red flags do you need to see before you decide to take action?\nShe is this unhinged before you're even married? Imagine what this will turn into once she \"locks you in\"... Run man! RUN!\n\nNTA! Unless you decide to stay with her.", "NTA for how you reacted.  You *are* TA for not dumping her yet.", "NTA. Dump her!", "She crossed your clear boundaries regarding meeting your son. She has set unreasonable expectations for your son, expectating him to know and follow her preferences when he barely knows her, and gets angry when they're not followed. She felt entitled to yell at your son in public, which is bad enough, but did it over a small bit of etiquette, when the yelling was a MAJOR breech of etiquette. She then insulted you and your child's mother for not having already taught him *her* etiquette rules. She refused to admit any wrong or apologize to your son for yelling at him in public. His actual mother, and most decent mothers, would apologize to their teenage child for embarrassing them in public over something so small, but this wannabe step-parent feels 100% entitled to belittle your kid. She then ran home to mommy to get validation and tried to shame you by saying her mommy agrees with her.\n\nNo way in hell are you an asshole for yelling at her. Defend your child and yourself. She's a psycho, and you're NTA, unless you allow her to continue her BS towards your son.", "No. In fact the only thing that would make you an asshole here is to keep her around. Break up with her before your son gets the wrong message about your priorities.", "WTF are you *doing* with someone who has clearly shown she doesn't care about your boundaries or your son's?", "She will never understand. As a step parent. She has no real power. She is trying to assert her power as a mother in the worst way possible.\nYour son needs you to be single and help him through his issues before you spend time with someone else and bring that person around him. Please help your son first, and break up with that woman as soon as possible.", "NTA, although the \"accidently showing\" up incidents sounds very stalkerish to me.\n\nOnto the dinner, if she wanted to correct your son she shouldn't be yelling at him loudly in a public space. If she even cared just a little bit about your son she would've been much MUCH more discreet about correcting his mistakes. Her action here shows that not only does she not care about how your son feels on the matter, it appears like she's taking pride in pointing out his flaws. She then gets extremely upset with you for DOING THE SAME THING to her. She now plays the victim to a scene that she caused. This is very selfish behavior, and its a HUGE insight into who she is as a person. My advice is the same as most everyone else's advice. Run OP, not just for your sake, but mostly for your son.", "Nta!!!", "NTA. \n\nWhat table manners?  \nI'm not familiar with this fork outside the plate thing. \n\nHer trying to surprise meet your son as well as talking about becoming a teenager's mother before she's even met them are \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9.  \n\nThen *her* mom harrangues you?\n\nHope she's your ex by now.", "YTA for staying with this person after sheet tried to ambush you to meet your son before you and your son were ready. Especially to condition him to get being his mother. She clearly doesn't understand boundaries.\n\nI know that emotions can make you overlook things. But hopefully this situation is a wake up call for you.", "NTA.  But you really need to see that this relationship is doomed.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m a woman with a daughter. I do not let ANYONE I\u2019m dating \u201cteach\u201d my daughter anything.  She will never be a \u201cmother figure\u201d to a 15 year old. She\u2019ll be Dads gf/wife. And depending on how she treats him is exactly how he\u2019ll view her. And right now? It\u2019s not looking good. She isn\u2019t a good fit & is trying to force herself & her views onto him. \n\nBasically, you should RUN! Do NOT have a child with her. Or you could very well lose your first born to a LC relationship.", "YTA. She is wrong for yelling your son because yelling and embarrassing a person in public is wrong. Hence, you are wrong too. You should warn her when she \"corrected\" your son. I don't understand why you waited to this point. She didn't conceal her wish to be a mother to your son, and she tried to discipline him. What did you expect? Is she so beautiful that you forgive her for all mistakes?", "PLEASE don't do this to your son. Leave this woman before she has the chance to make things worse. Your son will resent you all his life if you end up with such a controlling and suffocating partner.", "NTA\nYou mean ex right", "I'm sorry but the red flag this lady has hanging above her head is the size of Nebraska. NTA, GTFO ASAP", "Exactly. You think it\u2019s bad now, OP? When yall arent even married? Ho ho she will get so much worse to your son the second she gets a ring on her finger. And if you knock her up? Oh forget about it. Evil stepmother in the making. Seriously, dump her. \n\nNTA for defending your son.\nYTA if you stay with this looney tune.", "Mommy Dearest...", "As they say, when someone tells you who they are you should listen!", "Your kid not hers she needs to for real chill out\u2026", "Immediately is the key word here. That child deserves better.", "I mean she doesn\u2019t sound like someone who is fit to teach table manners \ud83d\ude02", "Yeah - years of Sunday dinners were how we all learned \"proper\" table manners.\n\nJumping onto some poor kid for some stupidly small mistake loudly enough to disrupt other diners is just insane. That's way worse than any faux pas done by the son.", "Whole lotta this. You set boundaries she IMMEDIATELY tried to violate, disrespecting both you and your son. She seems to want an instant family and be MOM more than anything else. This is already unhealthy. Any deeper and it will cross quickly into toxic. For your son's sake alone, break up with her. For your own, too.", "My dude you need to not just dump but f\u2019ing Nuke this relationship if you have Any respect and care for your son.", "More narcissistic hypocrisy. I swear that\u2019s how they ALL roll.", "Single mom to a 15 year old daughter here, I would have done a lot worse than just yelling if someone dared to treat my kid that way. Props to OP for maintaining control. NTA, OP.", "This!!", "What is this, the 1800s? Next thing you know, she's going to yell at him for not wearing fine linen to Olive Garden.", "I would have broken up the moment she tried to force a meeting between her and my son.", "I mean, he's pretty obviously not perfectly fine with it given his reaction to her?", "THIS !!!!!", "Her behavior is a dense forest of bright red flags. Stop subjecting your son to her unhinged actions. You've been with her eight months and already she feels comfortable abusing him, and that's on you.", "Right.   Why would anyone think that yelling at a teenager in a public place would add anything positive to the relationship?   And hill she chose was whee to put his fork?\n\nHer accelerated need to play \"mother figure\" to a 15-year old should have put OP on notice that things were headed in the wrong direction.   And the whole \"he knows I don't like that\"?   Whether or not the kid was aware, he had no obligation to change up for his dad's short-term girlfriend...whom he just met a few weeks ago..", "NTA. She needs to go. Yesterday. \nFTFY", "And what the F is with people dragging their extended families into their business?! Her MOTHER is taking a side?!? Ffs. I had no idea this sort of 'group think' was a common thing before hanging out on Reddit!", "NO WIRE HANGERS!!! Lol! Op is NTA. But I hope he breaks up with Joan Crawford ASAP", "OP must be colour blind or straight up blind to have missed the giant waving red flags she was wearing from the beginning. \n\nhonestly OP- YTA for that. you caused potential serious emotional harm to your son because you're an idiot. make better choices. this wasn't an unexpected outcome at all, she came in telling you she was crazy and would disrespect you/your son and you let her do it", "You aren\u2019t wrong lol", ". Her behavior was a million times worse for everyone than a fork being on a plate.", "Yeah, what is she even talking about? No fork outside the plate? If he's not using it at the moment, why would be on the plate?", "Ok but then why is he still with her.", "My best friend is named Christina. I have so much fun shouting \"no wire hangers, Christina!!!!\"", "\"Tina! BRING ME THE AXE!\"", "It probably wasn't noticeable at first but got slowly worse over time. It can be hard to realize", "Manners are about making others comfortable around you. Yelling at someone in a crowded restaurant is a million times worse than where you put your fork. Unless where you put your fork is into another person.", "Because not all humans are exactly the same and sometimes people need a little bit of time to process things.", "When it comes to a child you don\u2019t have time to wait or to process. Especially when someone is clearly attacking said child. That woman is a huge NOPE.", "The situation was immediately addressed and the girlfriend instantly left the location. The child was in no way continued chance of any type of harm.", "Yet he still is thanks to the fact OP has not left her. \n\nYou seem to focus on the incident instead of what\u2019s actually happening. At no point did he state he broke up with her or removed her from ever talking to his child.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12maa0d/aita_for_yelling_at_my_girlfriend_right_after_she/jga7uov?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button"]}
