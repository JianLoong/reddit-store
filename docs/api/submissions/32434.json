He doesn't accept, respect and support you. He sees your resources that he has benefited from as his right, and now his to use as he pleases whether you like it or not.

You agreed to share a home with only him. He doesn't have the right, morally or legally, to change that without your full consent and cooperation.\n\nReview your lease. I'm sure it specifies the tenants. It probably has a clause limiting how often visitors can stay overnight. That's to prevent visitors from becoming additional tenants. If bf continues to insist, together, check with the landlord about whether they would permit you to replace yourself on the lease with his sister. They will not, because she has a bad renting history. There will be a cost for breaking the lease and leaving before the end of its term. It could be the full rent due to the end of the lease. This WILL cost you money. But YOU won't be evicted, as they are likely to be.\n\nThis guy sees you as not only his financial and housing resource, but his to share with others.

He wants his adult sister to live away from her two children, whose father is already out of the home and in prison. \n\nI don\u2019t know which cultural norms would support this dynamic.\n\nFurther, he was evicted from his apartment and couldn\u2019t figure things out to get his own life back in order, so OP had to save him, despite that they\u2019ve been together for less than a year.
