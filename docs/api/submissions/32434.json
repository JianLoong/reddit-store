You would be NTA if you and she were on the best of terms.  Since you asked for advice, I\u2019ll add that moving out is EXACTLY what you should do if she moves in.  Don\u2019t even bluff about it.  Pack up and leave and stop paying rent.  Let them sue you if they want, but I don\u2019t think they will. They will figure out how to not be homeless by keeping up with rent.  Refusing to live with your boyfriends sister is just such a clearly reasonable boundary I don\u2019t understand why you would even bother fighting over it.  Either she moves in and you move out or you stay and she lives somewhere else (people do figure these things out for themselves if you just force them to, really!)", "NTA. Why live with not one but two people who have managed to get evicted, especially when the sister is not great to you, and that would only create an unpleasant living environment for you. Amy has other places she can pick to live.", "NTA- you should just get your own place.\n\nYour boyfriend has already chosen his sister over you since he\u2019s angry at your ultimatum. Even when he knows she doesn\u2019t like you he\u2019s willing to have you uncomfortable in your own home to please his family. \ud83d\udea9\n\nThere\u2019s no saving the relationship at this point, because even if she doesn\u2019t move in , your boyfriend and his mom are gonna be bitter about it.\n\nHe just showed you that his mom and sister are going to be the ones running the show if you stay with him in the long run.", "Sorry it's 3:16 a.m. at my place and I'm too tired and lazy to elaborate but still wanted you to know that you're clearly NTA.", "NTA\nEven if you disregard the fact that you and his sister don\u2019t get along, moving someone into a shared living space is FIRMLY a \u201c2 yes\u2019s, 1 no\u201d deal. Don\u2019t do it, you know she\u2019ll be a MASSIVE thorn in your side the entire time and she\u2019ll do whatever she can to drive you 2 apart.\nI get that he wants to help out his sister, but he needs to realize that doing so will likely end your relationship.", "NTA.

Because why is he messing up things with you to have her there? I wouldn\u2019t keep pissing off my girlfriend when my sister has two other places to stay, I\u2019d tell her to go somewhere else as I finally have privacy with my gf, Why ruin that? Also why would he wan\u2019t to invite the awkward atmosphere in when he knows your history with his sister, and like it doesn\u2019t even sound like she has a plan, She\u2019s just moving in till whenever she decides to move out,  Obviously nta idk why boyfriend is doing this", "NTA. Looks like she has problem not only with you.", "Just a second \n\n>her mother in law\n\nIs she divorced/separated? Why doesn\u2019t she move in with the apparent husband?\n\nWith the history you\u2019ve described, living together would be a problem for me.\n\nNTA", "I had to say this with my FIL. He lived with us for 5 years and complained about everything. I was reduced to being a cook and maid. No one helped. When we were set to move again I said if fil moves in I will move out. My husband was upset for a bit but I was done catering to him", "NTA", "NTA - new relationships are difficult enough as you get to know what it is like to live together. Adding the sister that is not on good terms with you would be a dealbreaker for me as well. Even if you didn't leave when she arrived, you would likely leave soon as the relationship fell apart with her presence and adding stress to the household. The fact that she has 2 other options available to her, she didn't attempt to find a place, and she didn't offer your BF when he needed help just makes her and your BF AH's for digging in on this one. \n\nStart looking for a place, and talk to the leasing office to let them know your BF is letting someone move in that you are not comfortable with and therefore you need to be removed from the lease.

In my part of the world, it's not easy to break a lease, especially if both your names are on it, and especially if you've lived there for less than a year. \n\nBut definitely NTA for wanting to leave.  She sounds like trouble.  Actually, they both sound like trouble.", "NTA  Move your things into the spare room and tell him you'll be staying there until the lease is over and he can move sister in then but you're not arguing about it anymore.
