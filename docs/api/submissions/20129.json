It\u2019s possible that the mom went in and blocked and then subsequently unblocked him all without the kid\u2019s knowledge, but then you\u2019d have to ask yourself why the kid didn\u2019t notice they weren\u2019t connected for a stretch in the first place.", "They don\u2019t get to be mad at you you for rejecting them when they did the same thing to you years ago", "Except that she didn't cut him off from the rest of her children until she had some kind of falling out with OP's aunt. \n\nYes, it's possible that OP's mom was SA'd or the result of an illegal or abusive relationship, but it's also equally possible that something much more selfish to cause her to want absolutely no contact with her oldest children. Like converting to or marrying into a strict religious community. I'm moving towards the latter because again, the shunning didn't seem to start until there was a fallout between the aunt and the egg donor.", "Did they? If my math is right, his oldest sibling who was raised by his mom is only 12 years old right now. \n\nThis falling out happened years ago. Strong chance they weren't in control of anything that happened.", "Also VERY strong chance Mom told the kids that OP doesn't want anything to do with them to make OP the bad guy. Easy to paint him the villain if he isn't around to counter her claims. I'm positive she didn't tell the kids the real reason OP hasn't spoken to them", "NTA \n\nthis is such a sad situation. i dont understand why your mom cut you out because of a falling out between her and your aunt. that had nothing to do with you. i would suggest you telling your siblings that you did in fact try to talk to them but your mom wouldnt let you for some reason. also, i would suggest confronting your mom about this. she has no reason to keep you from your siblings because of something you had nothing to do with", "NTA. What were you supposed to do? Tell your sibling the truth.", "I mean pretty obviously not, as your mother barred all contact. So I dunno what you were supposed to do.\n\nAll you can do is say \"I attempted to reach out a while back, but mom would block my number whenever I attempted to do so.\"", "NTA,  Totally understand I'm #11 of my dad's 13 kids. He used to say I ruined his 20 year, streak  of not getting anyone pregnant.  My older half sibs span from 18to 27 years older than me. We don't talk much, I put minimal to no effott into it,as they never cared about while I was a kid. Even when I ended up in foster care, my older sibs wouldn't even step up for temp placement.  It's very hard connect with ppl who are so much older than you that you and you're raised apart", "NTA\n\nI would recommend telling your sibling that you have tried, but your mother hasn't allowed you to speak to them. Sadly, my guess is your mother is trying to hide you for some reason. Maybe she's ashamed of having a kid so young. But your mom has made it clear that she won't let you talk to them. So this is your opportunity to tell your siblings that you have been trying to have a relationship with them. This would go a long way for them.", "NTA but I am curious as to why the falling out between your mom and aunt made your mom feel the need to not let you be in contact with your younger siblings?!?!? What was her reasoning to cut you out the way she did!! I get it, she was very young having you, something I can absolutely relate to, I was 15 when I got pregnant with my son and just barely 16 when I had him (I was raped by someone I thought was my friend) and I signed over custody to my parents so my dad could provide him health insurance and I allowed my parents to adopt him years later when he was 11 I think but I was still in his life. My son will be 20 this year and we have a great relationship. Just because I signed over custody to my parents didn\u2019t mean anything, I was young and naive and had a lot of maturing and growing up to do and school to finish. I couldn\u2019t imagine being a baby machine and not allowing my older children to have contact with their siblings. You didn\u2019t ask to be here, you did nothing wrong I don\u2019t think. If you want a relationship with your siblings explain what happened and that you did try and reach out but you were blocked every single time you tried and eventually you gave up. You can only be rejected so many times before it starts to affect you. I\u2019m sorry your mom did that. I don\u2019t understand what was going through her head but you\u2019re not the asshole, sounds to me like your mom is though!! Do what you feel in your heart!! Good luck!!", "Info: how do any of these young children have socials when they are under 10? What were your messages to them?", ">My mom wouldn't have more kids until she turned 24, and after that, she just kept giving birth (I have 11 siblings as a reference).\n\nJesus..... just.... why did she keep popping them out if she was giving like half of you guys away?!\n\nAnyway, NTA! Your mom defo fed lies to your siblings and they have no clue you tried to keep in touch! Not your fault, not your monkey", "Eleven is old enough to understand a lot.  At least respond with the information that your mother has blocked all your attempts at contact, so the siblings can understand they haven't been rejected.

Only 3 of them actually replied (but it was brief and they blocked me not too long after) the rest left me on seen and blocked.", "Preteens are certainly capable of lying. However, gaslighting is far beyond lying. It is a prolonged pattern of deliberate psychologically abusive behavior designed to make someone question their own sanity and perceptions. This just ain't it, especially given who's involved.", "\"Gaslighting\" is one of those hyper-charged terms today, but in the generally accepted colloquial sense, there is really no age at which \"gaslighting\" can't occur. It does not require a deep-level understanding or deliberate knowledge of how to achieve psychological manipulation. \n\nThat being said, I don't see how that is what is going on here. The kid is probably just confused and in the dark on the situation.", "YTA. Specifically where you said \"I just ignored them\". Your siblings didn't do this to you and while you aren't close or have any relationship with them, its normal to assume that when they break free of your moms mind control they would reach out to you. It seems heartless to me to just ignore them. Tell them that it is your moms doing. She gave you away and then blocked you from having a relationship with them and she is still actively blocking you. I know you mom is being evil, but don't be like her. Be better than her.", "NTA.  There\u2019s no obligation on you to be close with your siblings.
