I dont even know where the question is coming from (if you are TA or not). No one called you an asshole, and why dont you respond to your sibling and explain why?", "NTA.  You did try and I think your siblings need to hear that from you. You have one reaching out to you, so don\u2019t start being the AH now by ignoring him.", "NTA.  I think the only AH is the mother.  You need to realize something.  The sibling who reached out to you to ask why you never made the effort to see them again...\n\nYour mom probably fed your siblings a bunch of lies about you.  So they might think you hate them or something, based on how your mom talks about you.\n\nIf a person is evil enough to shun her own child, she's evil enough to try to get the rest of the family to shun the child, also.  That's the way these things seem to go, anyway.  :(\n\nIt might be in everybody's best interest if you start communicating regularly with just one sibling, like the one who reached out?", "NTA. Sad as this is on multiple levels, no moral or other law requires sibling closeness.", "NTA\n\nWhen you get blocked from contacting a minor (your siblings) by an adult (their mother) that's it. When your siblings are adults you can explain the situation to them and maybe even now that one of them reached out to you.

But then...how old is the sibling?", "Here\u2019s your response: \u201cI am sorry you think I did not make an effort to contact you or the other siblings over the years. The truth of the matter is your mom would block me from contacting you or the others. If I called, she\u2019d block my number. If I contacted you/others on socmed, she\u2019d block my account from contacting you all. The real question is why your mother does this. While I am open to greater communication with you and your siblings, please understand I am not open to being blocked and unblocked by your mother while communicating with you all. Ask your mom why she blocked me because I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nNTA.", "NTA. 11 siblings? Good gracious. \n\nThat\u2019s a level of chaos you probably don\u2019t want anything to do with. Be wise, pick and choose which relationships you cultivate, as I have no doubt that the other 9 siblings are bringing mom and mom\u2019s baggage with them. \n\nPersonally? Id be curious about my siblings but id come in fully armored with hard boundaries and redlines, at least until you got the proverbial lay of the land.", "You shouldn't ignore it, tell them the truth about your mom blocking you because of your aunt and hers falling out.", "NTA\n\nBut it sounds like she may not be aware of what your mum was doing. I\u2019d let her know.", "NTA  the thing is you did try your mom's interfering .  She can't run the risk of you telling the younger ones what she's really like or it could be she can't stand seeing you because it reminds her of her messing up. Be forewarned if you try again, you have no idea what lies she's  telling them.", "If they're reaching out to the sibling-who-shall-not-be-named they have probably already figured their mother out.", "You are absolutely NTA.", "I'll respond to the message I just need a bit of time before I respond, need to compose myself and all before I do.\n\nI do worry that my mom has said some bad stuff about me but hopefully I can convince my brother (K) to also talk with the sibling who reached out to me since he knows a lot of what she may have said to be false.", "You are absolutely NTA.", "10/10", "She's 11 I think", "Absolutely NTA", "Good! Definitely take some time to think about how to best respond. Maybe keep it light at first. If he has a good relationship with mom, you might not want to open with \"mom sucks.\" Might be better to say \"we have very different relationships with mom. The mom you know is not the mom I know.\" \n\nShe was incredibly young when she had you. That had to be overwhelming and traumatic. I'm not defending her because she made a lot of mistakes throughout your life."]}
