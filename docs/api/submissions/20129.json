If you can't afford it right now, look at getting some good quality help when you can.\n\nI'm not saying that your mother hasn't made poor decisions, and I'm certainly not saying that you owe her anything at all, but working through all of this may help take  some of the pain away for you, and it may help you decide one way or the other what you want to do going forward, much better than reddit can.\n\nHaving sex at 12 or 13 years old, then carrying a child, then 1 year later carrying another child to term, and giving them both away, all whilst her brain and body are still developing is a horrendous thing to go through. That isn't to minimise what you went through at all, because you had to grow up and live with the consequences of those events and I'm sure I don't need to summarise your own pain and trauma to you. Both are truths, and being able to make space for both, to see some of where her life has taken her, it might help you see your own path more clearly.", "If you don\u2019t think preteens are capable of lying, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. It\u2019s possible that the mom went in and blocked and then subsequently unblocked him all without the kid\u2019s knowledge, but then you\u2019d have to ask yourself why the kid didn\u2019t notice they weren\u2019t connected for a stretch in the first place.", "They don\u2019t get to be mad at you you for rejecting them when they did the same thing to you years ago", "Except that she didn't cut him off from the rest of her children until she had some kind of falling out with OP's aunt. \n\nYes, it's possible that OP's mom was SA'd or the result of an illegal or abusive relationship, but it's also equally possible that something much more selfish to cause her to want absolutely no contact with her oldest children. Like converting to or marrying into a strict religious community. I'm moving towards the latter because again, the shunning didn't seem to start until there was a fallout between the aunt and the egg donor.", "Did they? If my math is right, his oldest sibling who was raised by his mom is only 12 years old right now. \n\nThis falling out happened years ago. Strong chance they weren't in control of anything that happened.", "Also VERY strong chance Mom told the kids that OP doesn't want anything to do with them to make OP the bad guy. Easy to paint him the villain if he isn't around to counter her claims. I'm positive she didn't tell the kids the real reason OP hasn't spoken to them"]}
