You need to realize something.  The sibling who reached out to you to ask why you never made the effort to see them again...\n\nYour mom probably fed your siblings a bunch of lies about you.  So they might think you hate them or something, based on how your mom talks about you.\n\nIf a person is evil enough to shun her own child, she's evil enough to try to get the rest of the family to shun the child, also.  That's the way these things seem to go, anyway.  :(\n\nIt might be in everybody's best interest if you start communicating regularly with just one sibling, like the one who reached out?", "NTA. Sad as this is on multiple levels, no moral or other law requires sibling closeness.", "NTA\n\nWhen you get blocked from contacting a minor (your siblings) by an adult (their mother) that's it.

But then...how old is the sibling?", "Here\u2019s your response: \u201cI am sorry you think I did not make an effort to contact you or the other siblings over the years. The truth of the matter is your mom would block me from contacting you or the others. If I called, she\u2019d block my number. If I contacted you/others on socmed, she\u2019d block my account from contacting you all. The real question is why your mother does this. While I am open to greater communication with you and your siblings, please understand I am not open to being blocked and unblocked by your mother while communicating with you all.

Be forewarned if you try again, you have no idea what lies she's  telling them.", "If they're reaching out to the sibling-who-shall-not-be-named they have probably already figured their mother out.", "You are absolutely NTA.", "I'll respond to the message I just need a bit of time before I respond, need to compose myself and all before I do.\n\nI do worry that my mom has said some bad stuff about me but hopefully I can convince my brother (K) to also talk with the sibling who reached out to me since he knows a lot of what she may have said to be false.", "You are absolutely NTA.", "10/10", "She's 11 I think", "Absolutely NTA", "Good! Definitely take some time to think about how to best respond. Maybe keep it light at first.

If you wanted a relationship once and she blocked you, it\u2019s nice she reached out. It sounds like your mother told them a bunch of lies about you.

You have a right to control this relationship now and I\u2019m sorry it was rough on you with your mom growing up.", "NTA this is almost certainly just a matter of your sibling being too young at the time to understand what was going on.  It sounds like you did try to contact them but your mother wouldn't let you.  Not much you can do about that.  Now that you're not blocked you can reach out again if you and they want a relationship.", "You did try, but your mom, their guardian, kept blocking you, denying you access. You can only do so much. \n\nIf you want to reply to your sister, do so, and tell her the truth.

That may not have been her fault (we don\u2019t know the circumstances) but she needs to own her mistakes regarding her treatment of OP (who is definitely NTA)", "I wonder if they are trying to contact OP because mom parentified them and are trying to get tf out of there. That's what usually happens in huge families like this, the oldest kids, especially the girls, will parent the younger kids.

It's not the age gap. My youngest sibling is 8 years younger than me and we are two peas in a pod, and I'm 23. \n\nThe issue is your controlling mother. She probably doesn't want to acknowledge her past, and you having a relationship with those kids outside of \"cousins\" is a threat to her reality.\n\nYou're not the asshole, she is. She isn't allowing space for the relationships to exist.\n\nOP, if YOU want a relationship with your little sibs, make it happen. It's the freaking best. I love all 7 of mine, older and younger. We don't let family issues stop us from being there for each other, because our parents messy drama isn't ours. \n\nIf you don't, that's okay! You don't owe them one! Your mom made a choice for you that put you in the best position she could provide for you. That choice effects your relationship with her entire immediate family. It's complicated, and okay. Don't feel bad.", "NTA. Your sibling is 11 so may be a little too young for the full details or to understand. Just keep the answer kid friendly and tell sibling to ask their mom. When they turn 18 you can tell them your side.", "OP, you\u2019re NTA, but why has your \u201cmom\u201d blocked you from contacting your siblings just because of a fallout with your aunt?", "Go your own way.  You can't save the world.", "YTA. Your mom was in the right.", "NTA, but please tell your sibling the whole story, they deserve to know the truth.", "NTA odds are it was mom blocking you. just explain that without being judgmental. that for some reason mom blocks me out.", "NTA, but I would tell your sibling that your mom kept your siblings from you. She's clearly painting you with a dirty brush.", "YTA, because you're aware that your siblings did not ignore you, but rather your mother stood in a way.  Now that your siblings have more agency and tried to reach out to you - you ignored them.", "NTA-  but tell your sib exactly all the efforts you had made.   Then decide of you want a relationship with them.  But they need to know the truth if your mother has been gaslighting them all this time.  \n\nReminder that all your siblings know is what their mother told them.  Time to infuse some truth in there.", "He'll no, it sounds like you were a child when this was happening to you. I'd respond and lay it ALL out, the times you reached out, how your mother reacted, how your siblings reacted and ask her why she would think you would reach out to them after every single time ending in heartache. You were not welcome and wanted by them. I'd be brutally honest, you tried and they kept shutting on you. At some point you give up right? Not going to keep reaching to people who clearly don't like you or hate you for no real reason. Don't sweat about it. You've lived this long without them.", "NTA!! \n\nMy ex step mum stopped me seeing my sisters after her and my dad split up.

For the record, I'm open to communicating and would love to be able to have a relationship with you all. However, if your mom is going to continue blocking me and unblocking me at will, we might have to wait until you're adults to try for that.\"\n\nOP doesn't have to over-defend himself, and he doesn't have to be rude to his siblings either. They aren't in the wrong for asking questions. They're kids.", "I absolutely agree with your sentiment.  I dont understand why anyone would want to though.\n\nLike why and what would motivate you to want to start a relationship with basically a group of 11 randos?  If you got a letter in the mail asking you to meet up with 11 other random people because you might all get along and have a really cool time; would you?", "Yeah, after they had a huge fight my mom wanted nothing to do with her or me. I think its because me and my aunt were always close (she did raise me practically from birth after all so my mom should of expected us to be close).", "Shitty parents do this. My partners mom stole 10k from him, causing him to drop out of college and move to a different city. He went min contact because he had 3 younger siblings and wanted to stay in contact with them. The 15 year old comes by frequently bc he's now in dad's care (all 4 have different fathers) and he's recently told us that their mother had been telling them this whole time that my partner hated them and that's why they left.", "None of the other siblings are any older than 12, based on my calculation, so their ability to reach out is gonna be pretty limited.", ">if this sibling had previously blocked them, they should presumably be aware of that fact unless their goal is simply to gaslight\n\nNone of the younger siblings are any older than 12, I doubt they're in charge of who they block on much of anything, especially since this happened when they were even younger. I find it unlikely that a preteen is \"gaslighting\" OP.", "My partner and his siblings have also gone years consecutively and individually without seeing their cousins over falling outs between their moms. His cousins mother refuses to kick out her daughters ex (he lives with her after being dumped by my partners cousin) despite the very damning evidence that he physically and sexually assaulted her. Some parents are ass.", "Exactly. And oftentimes the next oldest will escape by moving in with their older sibling, so they may feel like they had that option taken away from them by a lack of relationship with OP."]}
