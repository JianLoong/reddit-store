We  have been living together for 2 years. In the time that we've known each other, we have rarely had problems.  \n\n\nAround 10 months ago, I started seeing \"Doug\" (23M) We worked on a group project together. After the project, he asked if I would like to go out sometime with him. We went out for a total of 2 months just getting to know each other and being very casual. At around 2 months in, we decided to be a little more intimate. I'm not sure if i'm allowed to say this year, but long story short, we had sex. I had planned on staying the night at his place afterwards. About 2 hours later, we were watching something on my phone when he left to pick up some food. He left his phone because he didn't want to have to pause the video and that I can catch him up when he got back.  \nHe started getting a bunch of texts and after a while, I planned to click on the messages and turn his phone off and stop watching. I found out that I was the topic of this group chat. After we were done, Doug had went to the bathroom and texted his gc \"Finally fucked a fat chick\".  \nThe responses were a mix of cheering him on, joking about \"my condolences\", or just simply saying \"ew\". Someone asked for pictures and Doug responded \"Dude do you think I wanted pictures of her body on my phone?\" I was heartbroken and left. I blocked his number and haven't spoken to him since.  \nSince that happened, I have struggled with \"getting back out there\" and have random bouts of insecurity and I feel like I second guess every interaction I have with someone.  \nLast Monday, Cat told me shes been seeing someone and he wants to hang out at her place. Yep, its Doug. I haven't really seen him since then so when she showed me his picture, I froze up and that feeling cam back again. I told her that I wasn't comfortable having him over and ending up telling her the entire story, what happened, and how I've been feeling.  \nHer response was, \"Well, maybe he just had like a sexual bucketlist and needed someone like you to help him\"  \nI was in shock. i asked her to clarify and she double down, saying that maybe that was something he always wanted to do and right now I was \"kink shaming\"  \nI told her I needed a minute to process what she said and spent the night in my room. Since then, I've been not as talkative with her. If she asks me something, I answer but other than that, I dont go out of my way to engage. We haven \"hung out\" since then and I've been doing my on thing.   \nThis morning she left to spend time with her family, and left a note saying that this \"silent treatment\" is manipulative, she doesn't know what she did, and I better fix myself nby the time she comes back or were gonna have roommate problems.  \nIm still so upset but now im thinking that maybe I shouldve talked to her more and brought it up again and that maybe I was being some degree of an asshole. But at the same time, I'm so hurt she would say that.   \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1688480982, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14qgraa/aita_for_giving_my_roommate_the_silent_treatment/", "score": 187, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is not a friend, in fact, her accusation that you\u2019re being manipulative is downright ridiculous. What, she read that the silent treatment is an abusive tactic somewhere and is now trying to say that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing? You aren\u2019t giving her the silent treatment, you just aren\u2019t going out of your way to spend time with someone who is capable of being so casually cruel to someone they call a friend. That\u2019s not the silent treatment, it\u2019s not manipulative. \n\nThe silent treatment is refusing to acknowledge someone after a minor infraction. I\u2019ve experienced abusive relationships where the silent treatment was given to me often. I\u2019d do something like hangout with a friend for the first time in months instead of my boyfriend, or ask for my bf to do the dishes (100% of cleaning always landed on me in one of the abusive relationships). Small things, things that shouldn\u2019t be an issue in a healthy relationship. First, it would turn into an \u201cargument\u201d for lack of a better word, but it wasn\u2019t really that, it would be too one sided. Usually the arguments would be 30+ minutes of being berated, just absolutely shit on, because I had learnt that staying silent and waiting for it to end was the safest option and it would hopefully end soon. That would be followed by days or weeks of the silent treatment. Not the \u201cI only speak to you if I have to and respond when you speak to me like a polite person and acknowledge your existence\u201d treatment, full on silent treatment. It was like I didn\u2019t even exist, like I was a ghost during those times. My exes that did the silent treatment wouldn\u2019t even look at me during those times, I\u2019ve gotten hurt in front of those exes and needed help, but it was silent treatment time, so they acted like I wasn\u2019t even in the same room. Your roommate has no idea what she is talking about.\n\nYou are NTA at all. Your roommate however, oh buddy, she is a major AH. Her ability to be so casually cruel is chilling. She is the one being manipulative. For starters, telling you that being upset over being degraded, body shamed, objectified, made fun of, and humiliated, is kink shaming him is wild. It\u2019s not kink shaming to want to be treated like a person, to not want to be degraded to the woman who made it possible for him to \u201cfinally fuck a fat chick\u201d and tell his friends. It\u2019s also not kink shaming when you aren\u2019t shaming the kink, which in this case, you are not shaming a kink, if that\u2019s even what it was for him. If his kink is having sex with fat women then fine, but everyone has to be aware and consenting. It\u2019s perfectly fine to shame someone for involving someone in their kink that has no knowledge of it and cannot consent to participating in their kink. You aren\u2019t just some fuck doll to be used. If his kink is fucking fat women then the women involved deserve to know and choose whether or not to consent to participate.\n\nYour roommate is being manipulative, the fact that she is able to be so sure of herself in all of this makes one thing very clear to me\u2026 she is not a good person. She doesn\u2019t care if she is right or wrong, she doesn\u2019t care how you feel. She only cares about how things affect her. Acknowledging and caring about the hurt he put you through would mean she doesn\u2019t get what she wants, which is him. He hasn\u2019t done it to her, so she doesn\u2019t care that he has done it at all, even to someone who she apparently considers a close friend and lives with (you). If you were dating someone and wanted to invite him over to hangout and meet your roommate for the first time and she told you he had done that to her, how do you think you would react? Do you think you would tell her that she\u2019s kink shaming him and maybe he just had a sex bucket list and needed her to help him? If the answer is yes, then you are being hypocritical\u2026 but if the answer is no, and I suspect it\u2019s no, then maybe it\u2019s time to question who deserves a spot in your life.\n\nI don\u2019t want to tell you want to do, but I\u2019m definitely strongly recommending that you cut your roommate out of your life ASAP. A friend would\u2019ve immediately lost any interest or respect in someone who did what he did to you, would\u2019ve agreed not to have him over and chosen to end things on their own. A friend would\u2019ve been disgusted by his behavior and cruelty, not accused you of kink shaming him. She is not a friend, she is a selfish, manipulative, cruel person who doesn\u2019t genuinely care about anyone other than herself and her wants. You deserve better, so give yourself the chance to find it. Make room for those who will be better to you, make room for friendships and relationships that have mutual support and love. Make room for people who will treat you like you matter, where you don\u2019t feel like you need to make yourself small or disregard your own feelings and needs because someone else says you should.\n\nHe sucks, she sucks, you don\u2019t suck. I hope you\u2019re able to move soon and spend time with people who are kind and aren\u2019t casually cruel.", "NTA. Doug is a poor excuse for a man, and your roommate is a poor excuse for a friend. I'm sorry you're going through this.", "NTA. If she's SO upset about the 'silent treatment' tell her it was part of your sexual bucket list. You just needed someone like her (T A) to accomplish it.", "NTA\n\nTime to plan your exit and find new living accommodations. \n\nDoug is gross. He manipulated you with dates and the impression of a relationship when he just wanted to use you for sex as a challenge. While not necessarily rape, he misrepresented the situation and did NOT get your consent for this \u201cconquest\u201d. You feel violated and that\u2019s the normal response. \n\nYour roommate\u2019s acceptance of this is disgusting. Her line about it being a kink? He didn\u2019t have your consent! You were not informed! I wonder what \u201ckink\u201d she represents to him then and if SHE has been informed or not.", "Anyway you can request a roommate change while she\u2019s gone?", "NTA\u2026my heart hurts for you, but as someone older and wiser, pick yourself and do not let either of those two TA\u2019s get into your mind a moment longer.  They do not deserve the time or space.  You are enough.  You are worthy.  You deserve all and then some.  As for your roommate,  I would tell her that she does not have to worry.  You are looking for a new place and as soon as the lease is up, you are out of there.  No one needs friends like her.", "NTA You already have a roommate problem.  SHE is it.  She is not your friend.  You do not owe her conversation.  She knows exactly where she went wrong. She won't take responsibility for her cruelty.  She is trying to manipulate **you** to give her a pass for her bad behavior.  She thinks she can make **you** feel like you are the problem.  You are not.  Stay strong.  Do not tolerate her disrespect.  You have this.", "NTA\n\nShe's not your friend OP. Either you, or she need to move out.\n\nHer response was disgusting. She went straight into attack mode, clearly demonstrating that her needs will always be the priority in this household. Her unwillingness to discuss the problem with you rationally and thoughtfully shows what little regard she has for you and your feelings. The passive aggressive note tells me her position on the matter hasn't changed. She still deems you the problem. But it was her decision to throw a good friendship down the drain for the sake of some sloppy d*ck. She is not your friend and she will make your life a living hell until you move out.\n\nWhen Doug crosses her off his bucket list, which he will, I hope you won't be there to pick up the pieces. Staying in an environment like that with a resentful, volatile housemate is not worth it. It will mess you up emotionally and mentally for a long time. Put all your energy into finding a new home ASAP.", "You need a,new room mate. She insulted you and totally ignored ypur feelings trying to make you feel guilty for how Doug treated you. Dump her like yesterday's tuna casserole. Tell her \" This isn't working for me. It is best we separate.\" Get a plan. NTA", "NTA. You probably need to find a way to break your lease at this point - can you just talk to the landlord and explain the living situation has become very uncomfortable,  he/she probably won't want the details anyway but stuff happens. If the landlord is decent they will try to come to a compromise with you. That girl is awful. I can't believe someone would do this to a friend. The bucket list and kink shaming comments from her are beyond the pale. I can't believe some girls are so desperate for a bloke they would stoop to this level. You've seen how she reacts, there is literally no point in communicating with her beyond a goodbye once you get out of that lease and leave the house.", "Get away from these horrible people! Do not let them tear you down!", "NTA. It\u2019s highly shitty of her to want to be anyway involved with a guy who treated her friend like that. I\u2019m sorry he did that to you and I\u2019m sorry that she refuses to see what an ass he is.", "I think the \"silent treatment\" is completely justified in this situation. Because honestly, what's left to communicate? The friend has shown a complete disregard for OP as a person and housemate. All OP needs to do is stand her ground and insist Doug is not welcome under their roof.", "I don\u2019t know if I wrote it wrong on my post, but we were watching on his phone. He went down stairs to pick up the food delivery so he was gone for a total of like 12 minutes.", "\"My family raised me with the good graces to not say anything when I cannot be courteous. What you said was incredibly out of line, if not abusive, and I owe you nothing.\"\n\nFind yourself a new living situation and cut this asshole out of your life. I'm not sure why you have another year of living with her, is it student housing? Can you speak with your landlord about finding someone to replace you on the lease?", "> I dont want to come off as sensitive you know?\n\nNo, I don't.\n\nWhy wouldn't you want that?", "OP, you aren\u2019t giving her the silent treatment and as for your concern about coming off as too sensitive, I get it. Sure, communication would be good in theory, but would it be productive? Would she, the one who said it was kink shaming for you to want to be treated like a person, be able to reflect and admit what she said was fucked up and apologize/make efforts to make things better? I don\u2019t know about you, but if a friend told me that the guy I was dating had done that to them I would\u2019ve been disgusted. I would\u2019ve immediately ended things with him and chewed him out, just absolutely gone to town telling him how horrible he is to treat not just a friend, but anyone like that. Personally, this is a situation where I wouldn\u2019t see any point in communication beyond the basics and saying, \u201cthis hurt me and has completely changed my opinion of you, I\u2019d prefer to only interact when necessary and then part ways when the lease ends\u201d. Even if she apologizes, she has shown you something about herself that makes it clear that she not only lacks self awareness, she lacks self reflection, or refuses to do that. Her actions and words are screaming that she doesn\u2019t care how it has affected you and just wants you to behave in a way she is comfortable with and ignore/push down your own feelings for her convenience.\n\nYou deserve better. Also, again, you haven\u2019t been giving her the silent treatment. I posted a stand alone [comment/response](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14qgraa/aita_for_giving_my_roommate_the_silent_treatment/jqoq1fs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3) to your post and explain that more in depth, if you haven\u2019t seen it yet, will you please go and read it? I want to say basically all the same stuff here, but it\u2019s already written out on the other comment I posted here as a response.", "You are not sensitive for being upset that someone did something really hurtful and fucked up to you, and then your so called friend made it worse by being horrible. However you are feeling about this is totally reasonable.\n\nI do agree communication is best here. I would tell her \u201clook, what Doug did was really hurtful to me. Whatever reason he did it, I did not sign up to be part of a kink, bucket list, or experiment. You defending him is hurtful and tells me that you care more about him than you do about me. I don\u2019t want to be friends with people who don\u2019t care about me.\u201d\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t apologize profusely, I\u2019d be looking for a way to move out", "You are not sensitive. Well not too sensitive or unjustified sensitive. They were rude and hurt your feelings. You sound like an awesome person who cares about other person\u2019s feelings. But these person\u2019s feelings you are trying to protect are hurting you in the blink of an eye. And they obviously don\u2019t care. If you can\u2019t say the words you could try and write them down. \u2018Dear \u201croommate\u201d, you hurt my feelings by saying such and such. I did not expect these kind of unkind words of you. However, I do expect an apology for these hurtful words.\u2018", "Remind her that you\u2019re a human being, not a kink. You\u2019re not kink shaming him by being hurt that he blatantly and disrespectfully used you. Tell her that not only was it hurtful to find out one of your best friends thinks your value is in your body (and with her dismissiveness the implication was that you\u2019re only worth having sex with if someone has a kink) but that it changed your entire perspective on your relationship on your relationship with her and on who she is as a person.\n\nTell her she is the roommate problem, that she\u2019s fatphobic and misogynistic and you need to evaluate if you even want to live with someone like that. That it\u2019s not manipulative to not want to talk to someone who\u2019s been an AH to you, it\u2019s human nature. That you are not the one who needs to \u201cfix\u201d yourself, she is. \n\nOP, life is too short and you are too valuable to waste time with people who view you like this and dehumanize you. You deserve better. You deserve friends who have your back and men who want to have sex with you because you\u2019re you and you\u2019re beautiful and they love you, not douchebags who never matured past middle school and just want to check off another box on misogyny bingo.\n\nYou are not the problem. Do yourself a favor and do whatever you can to find new friends who will love you wholeheartedly- exactly the way you deserve to be lived.\n\nNTA my dear. Take care of yourself and let the trash do the same.", "I would lay out that what he did was hurtful, and even if he had a \"kink , he did not engage in it in a reaponsible way. He insulted you and your body to all of his friends. If his kink is for humiliating his partners, then he needs to get their consent to engage in that. \nWhat he did was disgusting, and your roommate is trying to justify it because she is in denial.
