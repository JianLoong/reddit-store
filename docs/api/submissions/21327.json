We  have been living together for 2 years. In the time that we've known each other, we have rarely had problems.  \n\n\nAround 10 months ago, I started seeing \"Doug\" (23M) We worked on a group project together. After the project, he asked if I would like to go out sometime with him. We went out for a total of 2 months just getting to know each other and being very casual. At around 2 months in, we decided to be a little more intimate. I'm not sure if i'm allowed to say this year, but long story short, we had sex. I had planned on staying the night at his place afterwards. About 2 hours later, we were watching something on my phone when he left to pick up some food. He left his phone because he didn't want to have to pause the video and that I can catch him up when he got back.  \nHe started getting a bunch of texts and after a while, I planned to click on the messages and turn his phone off and stop watching. I found out that I was the topic of this group chat. After we were done, Doug had went to the bathroom and texted his gc \"Finally fucked a fat chick\".  \nThe responses were a mix of cheering him on, joking about \"my condolences\", or just simply saying \"ew\". Someone asked for pictures and Doug responded \"Dude do you think I wanted pictures of her body on my phone?\" I was heartbroken and left. I blocked his number and haven't spoken to him since.  \nSince that happened, I have struggled with \"getting back out there\" and have random bouts of insecurity and I feel like I second guess every interaction I have with someone.  \nLast Monday, Cat told me shes been seeing someone and he wants to hang out at her place. Yep, its Doug. I haven't really seen him since then so when she showed me his picture, I froze up and that feeling cam back again. I told her that I wasn't comfortable having him over and ending up telling her the entire story, what happened, and how I've been feeling.  \nHer response was, \"Well, maybe he just had like a sexual bucketlist and needed someone like you to help him\"  \nI was in shock. i asked her to clarify and she double down, saying that maybe that was something he always wanted to do and right now I was \"kink shaming\"  \nI told her I needed a minute to process what she said and spent the night in my room. Since then, I've been not as talkative with her. If she asks me something, I answer but other than that, I dont go out of my way to engage. We haven \"hung out\" since then and I've been doing my on thing.   \nThis morning she left to spend time with her family, and left a note saying that this \"silent treatment\" is manipulative, she doesn't know what she did, and I better fix myself nby the time she comes back or were gonna have roommate problems.  \nIm still so upset but now im thinking that maybe I shouldve talked to her more and brought it up again and that maybe I was being some degree of an asshole. But at the same time, I'm so hurt she would say that.   \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1688480982, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14qgraa/aita_for_giving_my_roommate_the_silent_treatment/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA. I would have been way, way less respectful than silence.", "NTA, but I think communication would be better than the silent treatment. Very, very specific communication about why what she said was so fucked up. And I would make it very angry communication. Say what you mean.", "NTA. She's not your friend.", "NTA. Waiting for her to come back home in tears because Doug will give her the same treatment he gave you.", "I mean you can have another conversation, but she clearly doesn't think a lowlife like Doug is beneath her, so I'm not sure what the point would be. You are 100% NTA though. And get back out there when you're ready. The world is waiting for you. Take care.", "NTA!!! I'm sorry you had to go through this in the first place. When she comes back, maybe you can sit her down and have an honest conversation about how her words were hurtful and inconsiderate, but you don't need to apologize for your actions. I think given how hurtful she was to you, a silent treatment is a normal and valid response. However, now that you're given the opportunity, I think you should call her out so she doesn't continue this behavior in the future.", "NTA.   I can't get over her saying \"kink shaming\" to you being absolutely disrespected and insulted.  \n\nIf I were you the friendship with her would be over.    She is choosing a total AH over you.     \n\nDoug is the AH x1000.", "NTA. Kinks should always involve communication, consent and often (unless publicity is your thing) privacy. You were taken advantage of and humiliated, she\u2019s being selfish.", "Wow, she's nasty, what a mean girl. She's right though, you need to fix yourself by thr time she gets back - fix yourself a new place and leave that chick. \n\nNTA I hate Doug and I wish he could be shamed in the same way he shamed you. What a disgusting shitty little boy. He's an AH and so is your roommate. If you think about it, they deserve each other.", "Nt\nKink shaming? Like, are you supposed to let h continue to fuck you cause he may like big girls? Hell no. You were used and insulted. If she doesn\u2019t see that, that her problem and \u2018roommate problems\u2019 are the least of her troubles", "NTA.\n\nExplain to your roommate in words she can understand the following issues:\n\n1. You have a right or feel safe in your home. Doug is not allowed in your home because Doug doesn\u2019t make you feel safe. \n\n2. Having a kink is not an excuse for disrespectful behavior. Even kinks that involve more controversial activities have to be consensual for all parties involved and be based in mutual respect.  What happened to you wasn\u2019t because of a kink, it was because someone wanted to manipulate you into sleeping with him.\n\n3. Her wording and excuses imply that she agrees that you deserved to be taken advantage of because of your weight. It is reprehensible that she believes whether or not someone deserves basic human dignity is tied to a number on a scale.\n\n4. You are NOT ignoring her. You have simply become aware that you two are in fact not friends. Friends do not respond to the discovery that someone went through a traumatic sexual encounter by victim blaming and shaming someone for their weight. Decent human don\u2019t do that to strangers, let alone friends.\n\n5. If she cannot accept or see how hurtful and cruel her choices have been so far then the only way forward is by establishing clear boundaries for the apartment as roommates instead of friends. \n\n6. Even with that in mind you are strongly considering whether you feel comfortable enough staying in the apartment and will be looking into your options for different living arrangements.", "NAH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Saying \u201chey I\u2019m upset about xyz still and I\u2019m not ready to talk to you yet\u201d is the more mature way to go about it\n\nThat being said, your roommate kinda sucks. It sounds to me like she has a big crush on this guy and doesn\u2019t want to believe that he is bad. She\u2019s not being supportive to you and you have the right as someone in the house to say he isn\u2019t allowed in again \n\nAlso I\u2019m sorry, this all sounds awful", "[removed]", "She's TA. No way does she not know why you are upset. She doesn't think you should be so she's doubling down. Try to find a new place and new roommate.", "I just dont know what to say to her.

Tell her to look at his GC to see what she is on the bucket list. \nTell her good luck with dating him. If she want to bring him over she should. I would sit in the living room when he came over and say hi I\u2019m the fat chick you slept with and you\u2019re the tiny p*nis guy that I slept with. Tell him your gc was cracking up over his inability to give you an orgasm and that you had to fake it. But have a great time with my roommate and give them a wink and sauntered back to your room.", "Maybe write things down before you talk to her. Type out an email so you can get your thoughts together, and then instead of sending it, talk to her about everything that came up while you were working on it. \n\nThis is something you absolutely SHOULD be sensitive about. Don't feel bad about having emotions about how your friend spoke to you, or how Doug treated you. Speaking up for yourself when people are unkind to you is an important skill to develop. You don't have to get into ugly name calling or anything, but clearly conveying that you're angry because of reasons is something you should be able to do. I used to have trouble with this kind of confrontation, but learning to be assertive about my feelings has done me so much good.", "Use this time to look for another living situation and if she pushes this issue when she gets back, you can tell her you already have roommate problems. The fact that she thinks it\u2019s ok for someone to use someone else for their sexual bucket list while the other person thinks they\u2019re proceeding in a regular relationship that involves feelings tells us all that she\u2019s an AH. \n\nOr you can tell her having her as a friendly roommate for two years was on your college bucket list, but now that the two years is up, you have no further desire to be particularly friendly with her.\n\n(Ok, in all seriousness, the adult thing to do is to talk through why you were hurt by her comment and his treatment of you and proceed from there, but ngl, I just hope you find a new housing situation and peace out with a snarky comment)", "Oh man I do not think I\u2019m confident enough to say all of that haha. I still have another year living with her and I\u2019m not sure what that\u2019s going to look like.", "Girl you better get that confidence soon because don\u2019t like a d*ck like this dude make you self conscious. Everybody has flaws including the dude. Don\u2019t let either of them get the best of you. Stand up for yourself. \nPeople are just mean and especially ppl on the cusp of adulthood. Sometimes you gotta put ppl in their places. \nAs my bf say when I complain about my tummy or something he asks me if I think he doesn\u2019t have flaws.\nHe is like I\u2019m not looking at your tummy. Sometimes he can be a keeper.\nJust tell your roommate her comment is horrible and if the situation was reversed you would have understood", "I would just text her back and let her know that you read her note and are committed to be a respectful roommate for the next year.  However, you no longer view her as a friend due to her rude and dismissive comments regarding Doug."]}
