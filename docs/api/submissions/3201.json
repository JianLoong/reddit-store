My little sister would be grilled everyday after school about what she'd eaten.   My mother was on a constant diet.  She was a normal weight.  Looking back at photos of my sister and me, we're both average weight, not close to fat, even though at the time I hated my huge flabby belly.

I was very athletic and built a bit sturdier than my sisters but was not overweight. \nI'm 43 now and that comment still stings. \n\nThe bright spot of that event was my mama telling me \"it's okay to tell him to eat shit and die\", so I did.

Especially with social media, filters, and photoshop.\n\nI think it's a great thing that you were protecting her from someone who could really do damage.
