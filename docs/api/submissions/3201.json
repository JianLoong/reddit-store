As someone who went through the same thing as a teen with my grandmother making snide comments (and I wasn't overweight back then), this can have a negative impact. Protect your daughter from that \"momster\".", "NTA she ain\u2019t been there for 14 years she has no right to say anything", "NTA. Also, it seems you clarified at least twice. Were you supposed to clarify for each bite? The mom was projecting and possibly envious of your daughter 's slim body size. I am so sorry for the two of you, but especially your daughter. You did the right thing. The woman is not a \"mom\" she's an egg donor, basically a stranger, and also strange ! What a hostess !", "NTA... You did what you needed to protect your daughter. Well done.", "NTA.  \n\n**Leaving like that was the SANE thing to do.  It was the good parent thing to do.**  \n\n**You were protecting your daughter** from behavior that is exactly how body issues and food issues and all kinds of emotional abuses happen to a child, that can do deep damage.  **Walking out of a situation where your child is being trained to accept abuse, that's protecting her.**  Talking wouldn't have solved the problem, because the problem was abusive behavior being normalized.\n\nI hope you talk with your daughter about what happened, and that those rude actions and comments weren't about her, but were projections of her mother's issues.", "NTA, the moment this woman gets back into your daughters life she decided to verbally and emotionally abuse her and possibly give her an eating disorder. She is the AH and doesn't deserve to see or hear from your daughter ever again!!!", "NTA. Dude\u2026 she\u2019s fucked in the head and I would not let her around my daughter ever again.", "NTA.\n\nYou're trying to prevent your daughter's mother from giving her a lifelong struggle with eating disorders.\n\nYou also watched her be humiliated multiple times at a family dinner, patiently trying to give her mother the benefit of the doubt, and enough was enough.\n\nGood for you for removing her from that situation.", "NTA, and not a low blow.  You knew the source of the problem (the mother's personal insecurities) and you called her out for it.  She needed to hear it. \n\nIf there has been very little contact to begin with, and your daughter is not seeking it out, herself, it may be time to re-evaluate whether you want the contact to continue.  The teen years are very difficult.  Kids are impressionable, and often eating disorders start to happen at this age.  It may be worth it to consult a professional on your own for advice whether the upsides to renewing a relationship with this type of mother at age 14 override the damage that could be done by a parent who clearly has issues that she is projecting onto her daughter.\n\nMy gut tells me there is no upside, but I'm not a therapist.", "NTA! Do not let these people in your daughter's life! I am so glad you got this warning this early. \n\n>I said that the fact that she just ignored me telling her she\u2019s hurting her kid shows me she isn\u2019t ready to have her in her life.\n\nExactly right. Please don't let her near **your** daughter again.", "NTA. I wish I had a parent that protected me this way at 14. You\u2019re a great parent.", "NTA  And if your daughter wants to try to know her supervised visitation.  Period.  If she doesn't that woman can go get stuffed.", "NTA. Good for you for speaking up and protecting your daughter. She\u2019s at such a tough age already and doesn\u2019t need adults making things harder on her. All it can take is one nasty comment to stick in her mind and cause potentially irreparable damage. Trust me, I had a coach say something about my size when I was her age and I remember it clear as day and it still gets under my skin 20 years later.    \nYou stuck up for your daughter and it is so valuable for her to know you are there for her and have her back.", "NTA\n\nYou're protecting your child first and foremost. Her mother is way out of line for trying to police what she wants to eat when she's not even in her life.", "NTA but your ex is. Good job on keeping your daughter safe.", "NTA. Feel free to do me a favour and tell your ex to **** off.  What an awful, abhorrent, unpleasant, waste of a human being.", "Keep this woman away from her. My mom and stepmom did the same BS to me and it gave me so many issues. Good on you for protecting your daughter. \n\nNTA!", "NTA and she never see her again while she\u2019s a minor.", "NTA people saying you calling her out with her own weight as a pow blow when she spent the whole night nitpicking your 14 year old daughters weight", "NTA - I'm so glad you decided to go with your daughter instead of just dropping her off.", "NTA. You are exactly what a father should be.", "NTA \n\nYou can't get it through your head your daughter has 2 parents? No she has 1 parent the one that's ya know been there for the last 14 years. I say fk this lady. I'd never entertain the idea of her being a part of anything again.", "NTA. She might not have participated in her own daughter's life much, but now she's trying to do as much damage as she could with that little time she has.", "NTA.\n\nYou did the right thing. Standing up for your daughter is the absolutely right thing to do. Who cares if you hurt the woman's feelings? She was attacking a young girl who is in her teenage years when insecurities are bound to happen. And she (the biomother) was totally out of line as she is not a part of the girl's life.\n\nKeep your daughter away from her and the rest of that family. If you allow her near them, that woman is likely to go near her and your poor kid is bound to suffer from mistreatment. \n\nKeep being a great dad. Kids need that.", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019re absolutely right to protect your daughter. Young girls are dealing with more than enough already than having to deal with a previously absent mother descend with obsessive nastiness over eating at a holiday feast.\n\n\u201cWe prepared plenty\u201d but she can only have a small plate with 3 of 11 dishes? \n\nYeah - that lady has an ED or some other issue that she needs to resolve instead if dumping on your daughter.\n\nGood work dad and don\u2019t listen to whichever AHs are saying you were wrong to leave. You just showed your daughter that nobody gets a free pass when they\u2019re out of line. A great lesson, especially when so many women are taught to put up with anything to \u201ckeep the peace\u201d.", "NTA.\n\nIn a situation like that, you'd expect the bio-mom to be on her best behavior. Either she wasn't or her best behavior falls way short.", "Be aware narcissists like to show up when there is something that they can take.\n\nWhen kids are little, it's basically all give from the parent.\nBut once they're a little older sometimes they can also give- conversation, attention,  chores, even money from small jobs.\n\nBio mom is interested now only because she is here to take. And it starts with control.\nYou can't get control of a well balanced  person until you knock them down a notch.\n\nShe is trying to manipulate to later control NTA", "NTA. You clarified several times and gave her plenty of benefit of the doubt. She\u2019s projecting all over the damn place with both the food and the \u201cunderstand that it\u2019s our kid\u201d but. Like, lady this is the second time \u201cyour\u201d kid has ever met you and you think you can go into crazy parent mode? On something that\u2019s not even an issue? Smh, she\u2019s all kinds of wrong. You were spot on.", "NTA  \n\n\nshe gave up the kid so has no say in parenting above maybe a distant aunt or older cousin", "NTA. Not her child. Can't bow out for 14 year then suddenly this be an our situation. Plus you are exactly right. Those comments were toxic and I can tell you from experience they lead to an unhealthy relationship with food.", "NTA.  Thank you for protecting your daughter and that your ex just proved it was the right move for you to be the only responsible adult to raise your child.  Keep it this way, your ex is a danger to your daughter.  Everything was fair game based on your ex's actions but wouldn't make a habit of bringing up the ex's weight.  Your daughter may not say anything but I bet that she saw you having her back.  Make sure you talk with your daughter to see what she took away from the  interactions with your ex so you can get ahead of any issues.", "NTA. Thank you for standing up for your daughter. And besides that, who doesn't stuff themselves silly at Thanksgiving?", "NTA. My grandmother gave my mother some serious issues with food that have persisted to this day. I once noticed that she had poured herself a good sized pile of chips, and alI made a casual comment, no judgment at all, and she almost started crying. These kinds of thing can damage a child for their entire life.", "NTA. Thank god she ended up with the right parent. I could imagine the life she would\u2019ve had growing up, otherwise.", "NTA\nYour daughter is at an age where girls often get a bit pudgier because of puberty. It's a confusing time, with so many physical changes happening and a lot of uncertainty about what she'll \"end up looking like.\" NOT like a gawky teen, that's for sure.\n\nIt's the worst possible time to instill hatred and concern about wobbly bits and features she hasn't yet come to accept. I'm shocked that her bio-mom made policing her food intake and body shaming her main theme on the occasion of her third time spending time with the kid-at a food focused family celebration! That's so toxic. Surely sucked the joy daughter may have started to feel connecting to unknown extended family right out of that day.\n\nKudos for making sure your daughter wasn't thrown into that without a safe responsible adult. You were needed. You defended your daughter. You removed her from the bullying her bio-mom refused to stop, nor even acknowledge.", "NTA: And at this point, she can't say your child is equally hers. She gave her up and only recently reconnected. She needs to put in a lot of time and effort before she can truly call your daughter her daughter and consider herself to be her mother and all of it is dependant on how your daughter feels about her. You're doing a great job, don't change.", "NTA, her mom is going to give her an eating disorder, and whoever messaged you that needs to stop trying to add to it. You did the right thing, and definitely be more cautious about her mother being around her.", "NTA", "Nta\n\n\nHer mom gave her up. She isn't her mother anymore. Stop going over.", "Egg donors do not get to dictate anything to your child. NTA.", "NTA you stood up for your kid twice and on the third time you took her out of the bad situation. Usually bringing up someone's weight would be rude, but she was trying to fatshame your 14yo daughter.", "Wow! The bio mom is toxic! Keep your daughter away from her. The two of you should go to therapy together to talk through her abandonment and the toxic reunion. She needs to understand that her mothers words and actions are twisted. She\u2019s at a vulnerable age and exposure to her toxic bio mom could have negative long term  impact. \n\nNTA", "NTA. But honestly, nowhere in your story is more than a hint about what your daughter was feeling and she should be the most important person in this story. Did she want to meet her mom? Did she feel embaressed by these remarks? Was she glad to leave the party? The answer to these questions greatly determine if you were an A H or not. And the answer is one that only your daughter can give you (not some strangers on the internet).", " HIS daughter in her life", "NTA. OP, that should be the last time your kid sees that woman. It seems like your daughter is doing awesome, and this woman won't bring any good into her life. She'll just harm your daughter.", "Gotta love moms like that right? I'm sorry you went through that. I was always either too skinny or too fat. If I was too skinny though she'd say it with a smile. If I was too \"fat\" I was in trouble.

You are so not TA.", "When I was 14f,  I could eat a normal plate, go back for seconds, then eat 2 desserts. I was a slender, active girl, and I was growing. Kids that age are burning calories quickly, for growth. My Dad was always overweight, and he would watch me eat with a wistful envy. No one EVER told me not to eat so much!

One was and still is obese but he's been losing weight since he has become more active. My other son is normal size and has a very active life as well as a high metabolism. Both are very healthy.

I hope y\u2019all have a pet she can snuggle and some decent ice cream.

I think next time if her mother reaches out you need to thoroughly vet her/her behaviour, and check in with your daughter extremely thoroughly. I\u2019m trying to withhold judgement without more info, but the seemingly casual manner in which this reunion came about, the second time she\u2019s ever met her mother, which can be emotionally fraught for a child even if they don\u2019t outwardly show it or can process it right now, kind of makes you ta/ESH. \n\nThese things can be extremely traumatic for children if not done with care, again I\u2019m trying not to pass judgment because of the lack of info but based on what\u2019s here you\u2019re ta for treating this so casually.", "Thank you for clarifying bc I was worried for your younger self.

Re: (3), since you didn't know and you had open lines of communication, I think the consensus read on this case (you're doing a good thing protecting your daughter; her mom's behavior is borderline abusive) is basically right.\n\nIn a lot of cases, a parent doesn't have full information about the extent of the other parent's behavior; that's why \"investigate to discover\" is important in these contexts, especially when something looks abusive (as this does).\n\nSounds like you're staying on the lookout for that abusive stuff now that you've seen it, though.", "That\u2019s fair regarding the word count, I asked the timeline question because if this is the first time she\u2019s seen her after years vs a recent reintroduction, and this is the second time after that, fair enough about the whole situation. \n\nI posed the vetting question because being reintroduced to a parent after absence is very emotionally fraught and can be traumatizing in the best of circumstances. I respect the word count limitations and not wanting to divulge overly personal info, I\u2019ve just had something similar happen to me and the fallout is something I\u2019m still dealing with today, and if given another opportunity I would have wished my guardian had made sure my parent was someone who was emotionally safe to be around. I also would have said yes to meeting them/spending time under just about any circumstances because I wanted to be accepted by them so bad. \n\nNot saying you didn\u2019t do a good job of that, and you can never be 100% sure of course, but that\u2019s just my reasoning around the vetting question.", "Yeah, why not?
