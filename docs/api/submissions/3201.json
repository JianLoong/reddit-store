You did the best thing for your kid. It wouldn't matter if your daughter was overweight, that is soooo not the way to go about anything.", "NTA. Clearly, this woman isn't ready to have her daughter in her life. She still needs to do a LOT of work on herself.\n\nThank you for standing up for your daughter and shutting down that bull crap about her body. You are an excellent father.", "NTA\n\nI agree, she doesn't need to be in your daughter's life if she is going to harm her.", "NTA - You addressed the issue multiple times and tried to resolve it kindly. However, this clearly fell on deaf ears, so you did the next best thing and left. It\u2019s sad, when people don\u2019t understand that one holiday feast is not the issue, but whatever they eat the other 364 days of the year.", "Nta, I\u2019m in my 20s still trying to recover from an ED my mom forced onto me- she used to never let me finish my food either but I was just short and as soon as I grew a few inches I was underweight and have remained so every since.", "NTA \nRemoving your child away from a toxic environment is the best thing you can do, parent or not to her what her mum did is wrong on so many levels as 14 year olds brain goes into overdrive whe  someone does this to them.\nI would back you for leaving with her, she doesn't need that in her life. I'm sorry your daughter had to go through this that's just toxic and stupid behaviour.", "NTA\n\nGlad you stuck up for your daughter.", "This woman is toxic... \n\nNTA", "NTA What is it with some women and their weight issues?  That was shocking.  And overbearing.  She did not respect any boundaries at all.   Be glad that you're the one who has been able to raise your daughter.  If you're going to let the bio-mom have contact, best find a way to let your daughter know how messed up that was.   You must do everything you can to counter that toxic woman's words.\n\nPossibly oversharing here but, my own mother would make constant comments about food and weight during my childhood, e.g. \"it's okay to be fat at your age, you'll get slimmer as you get older\".  My little sister would be grilled everyday after school about what she'd eaten.   My mother was on a constant diet.  She was a normal weight.  Looking back at photos of my sister and me, we're both average weight, not close to fat, even though at the time I hated my huge flabby belly.   As an adult, I've been only a stone overweight most of my life, and always felt extremely self-conscious of my body.  My poor sister's instilled food obsession took a worse toll, she is well over 20 stone and overheats when sitting in a cold room.", "NTA\n\nDo not allow this [bleeping bleep] near your daughter. JFC has she been living on a different planet. Who in their right mind would be so overly intrusive & rude to a friggin stranger!! She has seen you daughter twice... in like 12 years??!?!?! That woman is a Mega AH\n\nCorrection", "NTA \n\nThat woman is toxic as hell. Keep your daughter away from her. Write down what happened in case she makes trouble for you. Just do what you do and reassure your daughter that she did nothing wrong.", "NTA.  Nice first meet up...not.   Keep her away from Your kid- she's doing a head job on her no doubt.  Let the bio mom hire an attorney to get her visitation. You tried, they failed miserably.", ">She ignored that and said that I can\u2019t get it into my head that it\u2019s our kid. \n\nDaughter's spawn point is living an entitled delusion. NTA", "NTA. You did right. Unsupervised visits are not a good idea going forward.", "When I was 15 my favorite uncle made a comment about how big my butt was during our Easter dinner when I was wearing a beautiful new skirt and felt all kinds of pretty that day. I was very athletic and built a bit sturdier than my sisters but was not overweight. \nI'm 43 now and that comment still stings. \n\nThe bright spot of that event was my mama telling me \"it's okay to tell him to eat shit and die\", so I did. I don't really speak to him anymore for other reasons, but I'll never forget he said that to me. \n\nGood for you for removing your daughter from those comments and, I'm assuming, letting her know she has agency over her life and feelings and doesn't have to put up with toxic nonsense. NTA.", "Uhhh\u2026just because she gave birth to the kid doesn\u2019t mean she has the right to do this. Hell, even if her mother had been in her life for the whole time this would still be unacceptable. Please continue to protect your daughter from this person. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n I'm glad you were protective of your daughter and put up a boundary.\n\nAs for your comments to the mother, I think she got what she deserved. This sounds like a case of \"oh I will provoke but then cry victim when they retaliate.\" \n\nBody image is something that many teenage girls worry about these days. Especially with social media, filters, and photoshop.\n\nI think it's a great thing that you were protecting her from someone who could really do damage. Many girls get their sense of self worth and body image view from their mother. I'm happy that this won't be the case for your daughter.", "NTA! Maybe, if my father had done this with my mother, all of my siblings and I wouldn't have an eating disorder!", "NTA. And thank you for protecting your daughter from that BS. Eating disorders are formed out of this kind of behaviour, and it is necessary to make a clear stance against it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
