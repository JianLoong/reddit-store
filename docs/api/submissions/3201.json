This person is not a safe person for your daughter, because she sees her as a belonging she owns, rather than a privilege she must earn. This woman does not consider your daughter to be a *person* who is entitled to respect and care.\n\nSupervised visitation is required because most kids will overlook bad parenting in their desire to have their parent love them. Even if your daughter doesn't want to see this woman, she should be seeing a therapist/counsellor who works with kids who come from split homes, or at least in a support group for teens in similar situations.\n\nProfessional guidance is important because there is a high chance that your daughter will (and as a small child DID) internalise a message that there is something wrong with her if 1) her own mother abandoned her and 2) her birth mother still doesn't like her or think she's good enough. It is a rare person who won't be feeling even just a tiny bit of inadequacy - even most adults can't avoid this feeling.\n\nAs kids grow up and start establishing their own identity it is developmentally normal that they [think everything is about them.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescent_egocentrism) and will take responsibility for things that are not their fault. The link I gave can help you to understand her and you can use the links in the page to learn more. \n\nThere's a lot of books and web resources that can help both you and your daughter navigate this situation. You might find that literature for young adopted children who are meeting not-great biological family is helpful, because it's common for kids to dream up scenarios where there is a happily ever after, and when this doesn't happen they feel hurt and disillusioned.\n\n [Here's ](https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/family-diversity/parenting-after-separation-divorce/helping-teens-adjust-separation) another link which is about teens of divorced parents but the ways children are impacted is relevant to your situation.\n\nYou are your daughter's safe place, and sometimes that means we parents have to be the bad guy in order to protect them. Enforce rules that protect your daughter from someone who you now know is likely and willing to do harm to her. \n\nWhen our kids get angry with us it can be because they feel secure in our love for them, so they can get their feelings out while feeling secure that their loving parent will still love them. When they challenge our rules we can use that as an opportunity to share our perspectives and compromise where possible. [Here](https://psychcentral.com/lib/become-a-better-listener-active-listening#active-listening-steps) and [here](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-use-active-listening-to-improve-your-communication-skills) are info on Active Listening. These skills will make your communication with your daughter much more likely to  go well. (These skills are also awesome with everyone else and you will be considered by others to be a great conversationalist and a confident and respected person who people gravitate to.)\n\nSometimes compromise isn't possible though when safety is at serious risk.  This is when you explain your reason for the rule in detail and share the reasons behind it. Kids have trouble seeing beyond their own wants and needs, so we need to stay calm and explain the reasons **like you would to an adult**. This is IMPORTANT because your kid will soon be an adult and will need to know such information. It's EFFECTIVE because absolutely every human wants to know they are being 'seen' and respected as intelligent individuals. **It's always easier to accept limits when we understand why those limits exist.** Humans also like to feel secure and need to know what to expect, so rules can also provide security.\n\nEdited to add: Remember that your daughter is of an age where she will have to take action and make decisions without you present. There may be ways you can enable your daughter to take some responsibility in her dealings with that woman, while also knowing that you will act to protect her if need be. A mobile phone can be a good safety net so you can be ready to respond immediately. Just use tricks to make your contact come up first in her contacts list so she can find it immediately even if upset. Another trick could be an arrangement where she must text you her location and on the hour, every hour text you she is okay. A code word or phrase is also a useful tool. \n\nSome might think such steps are an over-reaction, but if this woman will defend her right to be cruel to a kid then I doubt she will be concerned about making sure your daughter's environment is safe.", "NTA", "Hey so I had an eating disorder because of hate like this.

It\u2019s so hard especially with chronic pain. \n\nI\u2019ve no doubt you wouldn\u2019t try to create food issues in a teen girl though. Fat is fat, not a moral judgement or a personality. but the mother in this story is MEAN.", "RISK OF \n\nnot WILL GIVE YOU \n\nnot the same", "My views are the results of my late dad. I have gone thru years of therapy to get where I don't hate myself. My dad was cruel af. Emotionally, verbally and extremely physically. I even needed surgery twice to repair the damage he did to me.  I nearly died from a severe beating that landed me in the ICU at 14 yrs old. I still feel jealous of those who had or has a great dad like you. I felt no pain when he fianlly died, only joy and relief and horror that I felt that way.", "I would never do that to anyone regardless of age. My late dad started calling me fat when I was 10. He didn't like that I was starting to hit puberty and filling out. I look back on those pictures and I was super skinny. My mom hated buying shorts or pants for me, since the only ones that would fit my waist were too short for me. The pants for 10 year olds would fall off. Mom had to put elastic in all the shorts and pants. I had to do the same thing with my younger son.\nFrom the age of 10 to 25 I thought I was fat, ugly and stupid because my dad was an sob and cruel af. I look at those old pictures and realize that I wasn't. \nIt took many years of therapy to get where I am today but I still feel horrible about myself because of his treatment of me. So I still hate my body and feel like a failure and a freak to have so many things wrong with me and Im not that old.", "NTA; good on you for protecting your daughter. Too many girls receive their body image issues from family.", "NTA. Sounds like you did everything right, and now you and your daughter know the \"mom\" is no good.", "NYA. Her mom spoke to her like that in front of everyone? You did the right thing. That was very verbally abusive and she bullied her own child. Good for you for taking leave.", "Truth. Overweight or not, bullying a child like that is not ok ever.", "I understand the goal here, however, this is a situation that can\u2019t just be avoided, she has to stop doing those things, I can\u2019t just beat around the bush here, then that\u2019s going to create trouble for me because how could I ever leave my kid alone with her? \n\nWhat if she takes her to eat? Will she say something? \n\nWhat if this increases to not just food intake but \u201cobesity\u201d in general and she tries to comment more on her weight? \n\nThere is just a lot that can go wrong without her changing what she says to my kid, and not addressing that is just opening so many more windows for her to continue.", "Did I ? I thought that I said to not project her insecurities of being overweight onto my daughter. Overweight, obese, and fat aren\u2019t curse words, I didn\u2019t say she\u2019s fat and looks awful, I didn\u2019t *judge* her for being overweight. I said to stop projecting that into my daughter", "You didn't say it, but you meant it.  Either way, my dude, YTAH for saying that and you're STILL saying it.  HAHAHAHA!  Oh well, you do you, boo.  \n\n\u270cout!", "Now your judging on what I *meant* to say okay bud if that\u2019s what you believe and yes absolutely I\u2019m still saying it cause it\u2019s the damn truth if you can\u2019t handle being told straight up what your problem is I suggest she zip her damn trap, but she didn\u2019t so I told her. learn to differentiate judging someone and calling someone out on there bullshit if you can\u2019t handle being called out don\u2019t do stupid shit.", "Yeah hence the edit saying that OP should ask his daughter, I had it in my head for some reason that she was younger the first time I posted, don\u2019t ask me why \ud83d\ude02 that\u2019ll teach me to post a reply when I\u2019m running on 2 hours sleep.\n\nAnd I agree, I wouldn\u2019t want to be either. I hope OPs daughter will be okay, what a horrible thing to go through.", "Get the fuck out of those articles I said a damn degree, because again you don\u2019t know shit about that child \ud83d\ude02"]}
