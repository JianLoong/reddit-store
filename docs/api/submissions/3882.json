Whilst it is nice that you want your loved ones to remember you fondly and as healthy and energetic as possible, the fact is that your loved ones are the ones who will be left behind and will be the ones who will live with whichever choices are made. They will be the ones grieving, and will be the ones who will want as much time with you as possible as they know that this is very limited. Even with your wishes, there will be people who will feel guilt that you passed away alone and some people can't live with that thought because they themselves may feel that they would never want to die alone.\n\nThis is a heartbreaking situation which involves delicately balancing the wishes of someone with limited time alive (you), and people who will have to live with the outcomes for many years to come. \n\nI note that you have been receiving therapy for your situation and it has helped- it might be worth having sessions with your brother, to hear each other's feelings in a neutral environment with a professional. Given that he is the only one aware of your prognosis, it is a lonely time for him as he has nobody to talk to so therapy with you both could help a lot.", "NAH.

Your brother definitely will feel horrible either way: if he tells the rest of the family, he'll be betraying you, but if he keeps your secret, the family might blame him. He might become the target of a lot of misplaced negativity after you've passed away. Your family might not remember what you were like in your final days, but they will be dealing with a harrowing reality that is potentially worse than if they'd been able to say goodbye.  \n\nSo no, OP, you're not an asshole.

I am so sorry for the diagnosis you've been forced to face, and I wish you comfort and peace on your journey.  You have the right to choose the specifics of your wishes, and I do understand your viewpoint.  People do handle such traumatic experiences in different ways.  I didn't get to say goodbye to my husband, when he passed unexpectedly, and I still feel the sorrow of that, over 20 yrs later.  My parents, I was with both on the night they passed.  Both were extremely ill, but it wasn't how they appeared that stayed in mind.  I still remember the life we shared, not the devastating illness.  But it brought me tremendous peace in being able to whisper what my heart felt, even though they were both in deep comas and likely never heard.  People often need to process letting someone go, in stages.  As you said, you'll be gone, anyway.

Either way, you need to do it your way.  \\*hugs\\*", "Sorry to hear this but it's your wishes and nta.\n\nYour rationale matches that of my aunt and dad. They didn't want many visitors in the end.

When I was young my Mom got terminal cancer. Everyone in my family decided it was best I didn't know so I spent her last years oblivious to the fact we were on borrowed time. I was a little kid but seeing my Mom lose her hair, weight, etc. It never affected me. She always looked the same to me. She was always just my Mom. After she passed I was so angry with my family when I found out they knew all along she was going to die. I would have spent so much more time with her, I would have told her so many things I wish I could now. I felt and still feel robbed of such an important decision that was made for me by my family. \n\nAll you're family cares about is you. When I remember my Mom it's as she was before she got sick. Thats how I picture her in my mind when I think of her..thats how Ill always picture her. \n\nI'm so sorry you are going through this. Whatever you choose to do will be the right choice no matter what", "NTA, this is an extremely hard situation that YOU have to endure so ultimately what decisions are made are yours and yours alone \n\nWith that said, the living will continue on.

I hope you make the most of it for all of you. Take care.", "NTA- I get why they may want to be there, but you're the one actually living with this. You get to decide how you want to spend your life.

She (mom) didn\u2019t tell us she was dying, and I never got to speak with her about it because of the state she was in. I was my fianc\u00e9\u2019s caretaker so was with him as much as possible. I have a lot of regret surrounding the loss of my mother. But, even though losing my fianc\u00e9 was harder, I feel like I did everything I could. \n\nYou are able to make whatever decision you want.

I remember him telling me that I didn't need to hang around (he didn't want to be a burden), and replying that there was absolutely nowhere else I cared to be, nothing else I wanted to do, and nothing else I cared about more right then than making sure that he was comfortable (or at least as comfortable as he was going to be in a hospital bed). And on his last night, as his breaths were becoming more and more infrequent, I held his hand and \u2013 they say that hearing is the last sense to go \u2013 I told him that we loved him more than we could possibly say, and that we would always, always miss him, but that he had done everything he could to prepare us, and so it was okay for him to stop fighting and just let go. \n\nIf my father had had to die alone, it would have absolutely broken my heart; my brother wasn't able to be there with us, and it certainly broke his. Our father didn't want to see anyone but family \u2013 not even the people who had been his closest friends for many years, and who had said they would fly up on a moment's notice \u2013 but, as I said in the beginning, dying is hard, exhausting work, and he just didn't have the energy for visitors. But I will always be grateful that he didn't exclude us from his bedside. As deeply painful as they were, those last hours, those last moments, when I held his hand and spoke softly into his ear, are and will always be the most precious of my life.\n\nIf you allow the people who love you best to be with you when you die, I promise you that all their earlier memories of you will not be overwritten by those last hours. And I don't want to make you feel guilty, but I hope you will consider the possibility that not allowing them to be with you might leave them with a much greater weight of sorrow than being with you could possibly bring.\n\nI also hope that you have looked into hospice. The hospice carers will ensure your comfort, and will help you and your family to understand what to expect (which makes it much easier to bear) and provide enormous comfort in all sorts of ways.", "NTA and it is your choice.  But I would humbly suggest that you not try to control your family beyond your death.  Being with you could be a great comfort for them, as well as to you leading up to it.  What could be really damaging is for them to always wonder if they could have helped you.  If your only reason really is your concern for how they are after your death, allow them to manage that.  If it's about something you need for you, that would be different", "NTA. Most of us won't get to dictate the terms on which we end. Knowing you're approaching yours is both a gift and a curse. The truth is that your brother and your family will have to come to terms with your death and your decision not to have anyone with you at the time. But being with you isn't necessarily going to make it easier on them anyway. Speak your truth and be firm in your resolve. Start meeting with hospice orgs and make them aware of your desire. They'll safeguard your wishes.", "You're not being an asshole at all, luv. (NTA for the sake of voting, here.) In fact, you're doing the best thing you possibly can for yourself: dying on your own terms.\n\nPeople generally take each other for granted until they're faced with the reality of no longer having those others in their life anymore. But this isn't about them: it's about you. \n\nIf you're worried about them thinking you're an ass after you've gone because you didn't allow them to know what was going on, then consider writing them some letters. Let them know that you love them, tell them anything they need to hear, and if so inclined, explain why you chose to go this route. They'll either understand, or they won't. Not having you in their lives any longer will be difficult of course, but none of us ever know how much time we have left, and loss is always painful even if we know that it's approaching.\n\nThe bottom line here is that it's your life, your death, your choice. Be selfish if that's the best choice for you and do it with a clear conscience. \n\nI pray that your transition is peaceful and painless. Journey well. <3", "I was with my dad, and it was horrible, but it was a shock and my world changed in a few days. I know he waited for my brother to come, and that would have been his wishes, to have family with him. My mum was anti social,  I always knew she'd go quickly, quietly and on her terms. And she did, nurse checked her, no change, gone a few minutes later. But I'd been to see her 3 times, not expecting her to live each time, so I got the chance to say goodbye. Your family will need that peace. It doesn't mean they necessarily need to be with you when you pass, just time to make a final memory. I'm sorry your time is short. NTA, I get what you're doing.", "NTA - I have been in the room for 3 loved ones and honestly, I wish they would have made the decision you did.", "NTA. This is your death, you get to decide.\n\nI was with my father when he died. I likened it to a birth in reverse. The death was peaceful and I was glad to have been present.\n\nMy Mother died 11 months later. She died alone, without my brother or myself present. I took a long time to fully grieve her death.\n\nI also worked palliative at a Hospice. It was an honour to support dying people and their families. Death is a part of life. I don't dwell on the actual deaths, but on warm memories. \n\nYou do what is best for you. I am here if you need me.", "NTA. My buddy did the same. Our whole friend group still miss the hell out of him, but respected his choice. We named his favorite surfbreak after him and put up a public bench overlooking the wave.", "When my godmother had a terminal cancer diagnosis we (her goddaughters and closest friends) all knew it and knew she didn\u2019t have much time. She made sure to spend quality time with each of us etc. We were involved with caring for her but she was living alone. A couple of us were living in different states and it was summer so some were traveling. She waited until everyone was home one weekend, probably the only weekend in months that would be the case, and without telling a soul took things into her own hands. She was probably weeks out from passing on her own. To be clear I am 100% not advocating you take ANY steps to end your life. Not at all. I am saying that I am grateful that when she passed we had the chance to be together. After you\u2019re gone, they will only have each other and your memory. I\u2019m thankful that she made her own choices, did things her way, and also was generous and took our grieving into account when she did not have any obligation to at all. Just sharing a story. You do you. Wishing you peace.", "NTA. As others have stated, it's a personal decision and your choice.\n\nHowever, as a physician that often treats people at the end of their lives, I recommend not being entirely alone. By which I mean that dying in a hospice environment with medical support is probably far preferable to dying without that support.\n\nExcluding family because you don't want them to see you at the end is one thing, but having someone to treat symptoms you may be having and to give you medications to make you comfortable is a good thing. If I know one thing about death, dying with your opioid receptors well saturated is preferable to the alternative.\n\nYou may also be comforted by having someone with you, and it doesn't have to be a family member that you need to worry about. For a hospice nurse or similar yours will just be one more death they attend with compassion and professionalism.", "Nah \nLet me give you some insight. I\u2019ve watched two of my good friends die. I held their hand. I got a chance to spend time with them. Yes, it was gut wrenching.\n\nDo you know what I remember about them? Everything! I don\u2019t just remember their last moments. I remember all the moments that led up to that point too. Your family will remember those times too. \n\nPlease reconsider. You shouldn\u2019t be alone. You should surround yourself with your loved ones. Find comfort in their touch. Let them be there for you.", "NAH. Neither of you are in the wrong here. You and your brother are trying to cope with your situation the best way you know how. Your brother knows what\u2019s coming, but he\u2019s not ready to let you go yet. You\u2019re both at different stages of the grieving process, which is what\u2019s causing the disconnect between you two. \n\nDeep down, I don\u2019t think he thinks you\u2019re an A H either. It\u2019s your illness that\u2019s to blame for all of this and he\u2019s struggling, whether he wants to admit it or not. You\u2019ve made peace with your fate, whereas he\u2019s not there yet. He wants the chance to say goodbye to you, but you want to be left alone when your time is up. \n\nOP, I\u2019m sorry for what you\u2019re going through. I\u2019m also sorry for the loss your friends and family will have when you\u2019re gone because you seem like a great person who is loved. I don\u2019t have any answers, but I think you and your brother are due for another difficult conversation.", "NTA.  Have you looked up \u201cDying with Dignity\u201d ?", "NTA\n\nI can\u2019t imagine the position you are in. Having lost my best friend without being able to say goodbye, it was traumatic and I think about it daily. It\u2019s your choice, but just be aware all they want is to be with a person they love.", "NTA. How you die is up to you. If you don't want family there towards or at the end that is your choice to make. It is *exhausting* to deal with a stream of people who want to see you before you die and to have to comfort some of them because you're dying. (Source: I know a lot of people who have died, and who have had to deal with visitors)\n\nIt's ok to be selfish. One thing I do want to bring up is that you can't control how people remember you, so own your selfish reasons for wanting to die without your family present. If you don't want your family there because (for example) you don't want the drama that comes with family visits, it is totally ok to not allow that family to visit. You'll need the help of someone, probably someone at hospice, to run interference for you. \n\nI hope your death is comfortable and peaceful.", "My grandmother passed in July wanted this. She waited until we left for the night before she passed. It was painful at first but we all knew deep down she wanted us to only remember the good times. I understand why you want this. It's not at all selfish to want to die on your own terms and how you wish. I wish you well and a safe passage into the next life. NTA", "NTA. If you don't want them to be with you, then they're not going to be with you. It's that simple.", "I don't want to call you an AH but yes you are in this case. I was one of the family members in a similar story. My grandmother who helped raise me died over 6-8 months and no one was really allowed to see her including me during this time. I regret that time often because it was just one more hug I could have had with her. One more reading from the book she gave me as a kid or just talking about my day and I know it would have made her sad but she would have smiled too. I lost so much time at the end and it hurts me to think that she died after being alone for so long when I could have helped her. Please don't do this to someone you love and leave them like me. Your family loves you and you should set whatever boundaries around visits you like but please please let them talk to you again. I don't know how long I'll live but so far it's been 11 years and counting of sorrow and regret on my end and who knows how much more. Just please consider it at least?", "NTA. You get to decide how you want to proceed. But maybe consider whether you are really going to achieve what you want? Because it sounds like your arranging things so your family\u2019s actual last memory of you will be full of confusion.", "NTA.\n\nMy ma didn't let us know how sick she was.  She was hospitalized and died within a week.   I wish desperately I could have been with her.  However, I respected the fact that she was very private about her health and she wanted to die that way.  Did it suck for us? Yes.  Should she have sacrificed her literal dying wish to make us happy? Absolutely not.  \n\nThe only hurt I feel about her decision is that by not giving us an indication of how bad she was doing, we weren't able to make sure all her end of life wishes were followed.  But that's an issue I will never forgive my father for, not her.  \n\nYou deserve to die on your terms. It's the last gift you'll give yourself.  You loved ones will have their feelings about it.  And that's okay.  Grief is a very personal, intimate thing.  You're dealing with your own about this situation too I'm sure.  Do what feels best for you.", "NTA. I was with my dad at the end, and it was what was right for me.  I have memories of him throughout my life, and the end does not overshadow them.

Your life is your own, and so is your death.  \n\nYour family may want to be with you because they believe it will offer you comfort.\n\nI think you care about how they remember you, because you care about them.    Maybe you can talk to them about your fears, and how not wanting them there does not mean you don't love them.\n\nIf you cannot, then do not.  Your job is to live your life.", "Perhaps you might consider spending time with the people you love you before you go. And then they\u2019ll have a nice final memory of you. Your death is your decision. I wish you all the best.", "NAH. As others have said, your life, your death, but I do understand how this must feel for your brother, especially knowing that he is the only one who knows. He will be going through this alone without someone to support him as he grieves his sibling. He will have the burden of telling your family, who will feel all the things others have described. But this journey is your own, and you need to do what you need to do to die with what your vision of dignity is.\n\nI was trying to think about what is at the heart of this. And I feel like it\u2019s that people won\u2019t know that they mattered to you. Then I started thinking what you could do to ease this journey for your loved ones while doing this your way. Perhaps you could write each person a letter, or maybe write a poem about how much your people meant to you and sharing some insights about why this was important for you. Alternatively, you could do the same kind of thing with video too. You could make it as simple and low key as you like, or you could go elaborate and get people fun gifts or experiences together - things you know they would love. Maybe it could be a fun way for you to spend your time and reflect on your life.\n\nOf course, you may not have capacity to do that or you may not want to do that for many reasons, totally fine and you still wouldn\u2019t be an AH. \n\nI wish you peace.", "NTA, but I worry that you may underestimating how lonely this will be.

It sounds like you have people that love you, and they want to be with you. You seem to worry that what they remember when they think of you is how you were in your final days, but from my experience seeing people go through terminal illness, this isn't the case.

The immediate difference between her in life and her in death was very peaceful and final, it really helped me with the finality of losing her and beginning the process of moving on.

I think if I had missed out on that moment I would have struggled to really come to terms with her death. I don\u2019t blame OP for wanting to be alone if that is truly what he wants.
