Whilst it is nice that you want your loved ones to remember you fondly and as healthy and energetic as possible, the fact is that your loved ones are the ones who will be left behind and will be the ones who will live with whichever choices are made. They will be the ones grieving, and will be the ones who will want as much time with you as possible as they know that this is very limited. Even with your wishes, there will be people who will feel guilt that you passed away alone and some people can't live with that thought because they themselves may feel that they would never want to die alone.\n\nThis is a heartbreaking situation which involves delicately balancing the wishes of someone with limited time alive (you), and people who will have to live with the outcomes for many years to come. \n\nI note that you have been receiving therapy for your situation and it has helped- it might be worth having sessions with your brother, to hear each other's feelings in a neutral environment with a professional. Given that he is the only one aware of your prognosis, it is a lonely time for him as he has nobody to talk to so therapy with you both could help a lot.", "NAH.

Your brother definitely will feel horrible either way: if he tells the rest of the family, he'll be betraying you, but if he keeps your secret, the family might blame him. He might become the target of a lot of misplaced negativity after you've passed away. Your family might not remember what you were like in your final days, but they will be dealing with a harrowing reality that is potentially worse than if they'd been able to say goodbye.  \n\nSo no, OP, you're not an asshole.

I am so sorry for the diagnosis you've been forced to face, and I wish you comfort and peace on your journey.  You have the right to choose the specifics of your wishes, and I do understand your viewpoint.  People do handle such traumatic experiences in different ways.  I didn't get to say goodbye to my husband, when he passed unexpectedly, and I still feel the sorrow of that, over 20 yrs later.  My parents, I was with both on the night they passed.  Both were extremely ill, but it wasn't how they appeared that stayed in mind.  I still remember the life we shared, not the devastating illness.  But it brought me tremendous peace in being able to whisper what my heart felt, even though they were both in deep comas and likely never heard.  People often need to process letting someone go, in stages.  As you said, you'll be gone, anyway.

Either way, you need to do it your way.  \\*hugs\\*", "Sorry to hear this but it's your wishes and nta.\n\nYour rationale matches that of my aunt and dad. They didn't want many visitors in the end.

When I was young my Mom got terminal cancer. Everyone in my family decided it was best I didn't know so I spent her last years oblivious to the fact we were on borrowed time. I was a little kid but seeing my Mom lose her hair, weight, etc. It never affected me. She always looked the same to me. She was always just my Mom. After she passed I was so angry with my family when I found out they knew all along she was going to die. I would have spent so much more time with her, I would have told her so many things I wish I could now. I felt and still feel robbed of such an important decision that was made for me by my family. \n\nAll you're family cares about is you. When I remember my Mom it's as she was before she got sick. Thats how I picture her in my mind when I think of her..thats how Ill always picture her. \n\nI'm so sorry you are going through this. Whatever you choose to do will be the right choice no matter what", "NTA, this is an extremely hard situation that YOU have to endure so ultimately what decisions are made are yours and yours alone \n\nWith that said, the living will continue on.

She (mom) didn\u2019t tell us she was dying, and I never got to speak with her about it because of the state she was in. I was my fianc\u00e9\u2019s caretaker so was with him as much as possible. I have a lot of regret surrounding the loss of my mother. But, even though losing my fianc\u00e9 was harder, I feel like I did everything I could. \n\nYou are able to make whatever decision you want.

Of course, they will grieve you, but will them being in the room make that grief different? \nStand your ground on this.", "NTA. Your journey to the well of souls is yours to make. You must face it on your own terms. Your people will be waiting for you on the other side. Hopefully your living family can accept this. If they cannot, you'll see them eventually. By then, they will understand. Safe journey, traveller.", "NAH -\nYou should have autonomy over your life and your death.\n\nThat being said, since you're concerned with the legacy you leave behind, I'd like to offer perspective as a survivor who got the chance to spend those precious final moments with someone who was very deteriorated. I don't remember the details of those moments, like what she looked like or her state of mind. It's more like an imprint on my heart, a sense of peace and closure. I remember telling her I love her and I'm grateful for our time together. If she was just suddenly gone and I didn't get the chance to say goodbye because she chose not to let me in, the final imprint on my heart would be confusion, hurt, and maybe even anger and sense of betrayal.", "NTA I understand it because you\u2019re already processing so much for your own life. I do suggest leaving a letter for those you know this will shock the most. Make it meaningful and let them know it was because you wanted to preserve that memory. The last smile the last laugh etc not the suffering you may endure the sickness and weakness etc. I wish you the very best with what you have left", "NTA have you considered a death doula? They will support you regardless of what your family thinks. They could help you keep that boundry with your family and help them accept it.", "You have to choose what is best, all things considered.\n\nGod bless you on your journey.", "I can say, it's your death. I my Gran recently passed and I didn't see her when she died but I saw what it was leading up to was tough and when my godfather died I didn't see him nor did I go to his funeral, I was only 5. He did wake up to say goodbye to me and my twin and we didn't even realize he kept it so positive up until we left. Give them a chance to say goodbye but they need to respect you're choice. My condolences for all you're going through.\n\nNTA", "NTA, guess what, you have a right to be selfish. The only person who has ownership of your time is you. In your final moments, your time isn't public property. If you want to be alone, then set things up so you will be.", "NAH I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole. And your wishes should be respected, should you decide they\u2019re final. But I think it may be important to consider that just like your impressions of people you know don\u2019t consist of only your most recent interaction with them, nor will your family and loved ones fail to remember you as you were. They will have a whole lifetime of perspective on who you are that all comes together in their memories. I think you should decide how YOU want to spend your remaining time, and make your decisions based on that. Do YOU want to see your loved ones as you\u2019re dying? Do YOU want that time alone? Whatever you decide will be valid and I hope your family honors your wishes gracefully.", "NTA for yourself but please try and understand how your family are feeling too. They will want to be with you, to support, to love, to help\u2026.it\u2019s hard for them too. When you are gone, they will grieve and no doubt think to themselves, if only we could have done x y and z, if only we could have offered a hand to hold, shared a few minutes with you. I completely understand how you feel too. You are entitled to have the death you want. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s something you feel you could do but could you write a letter each for these family members, thanking them for respecting your wishes, maybe one or two shared experiences, something you both found funny or touching. Ending with how much you love them. It might also give you pleasure to look back at some happy memories. I hope you have a peaceful, comfortable death on your own terms. It is very brave of you to want to do it this way.", "As someone who lost someone important, we remember people the way they were at their best anyway and not remember them for the last moment we saw them. But not being able to say goodbye and get closure is one of the hardest feelings to get over. And instead of people remembering who you are, you just leave a bunch of people with issues questioning what they did to deserve that", "Thank you! This is how I feel too. The idea of people in the room with me actively dying weird me out. Just leave me alone and let me die in piece. It not about \"family\" or what \"they\" need. I want to go and not have witnesses gawking at me. How is that selfish.  Told my sister when I had cancer. What did she do ...she blabbed to my older kids. Never will I tell her again. NTA. OP if you want to go in peace alone then do just that.", "NTA. Would you be able to do something akin to a living funeral in the immediate future then let people know gently that the end will be Private for you. You've made your peace and this is probably the last time you'll see them but you will ensure they know after the event and please remember you as you've been not as you'll be in the days to follow . \nThat way you give them the gift of closure to some degree and you get to go from this world knowing how you're loved and that you have done all you can and now your death is for yourself. No one else.  I wish you a smooth transition, I hope they can make it as painless as possible and that you are able to slip away in your sleep. Very best wishes from one stranger to another.", "You deserve to choose how your death will go. That is your moment of peace, and since you have the chance to, you should decide how it goes and who you are with. It makes sense for your brother to be upset, but hopefully in time he will understand why you've made this decision. \n\nI really have no judgement for this as the situation is so tender and sensitive, I feel I don't really have the right to make a call on it even though you have asked upon us, I'm sorry, but I send you my love in this time.", "NTA - it may be difficult for your family to understand but this is definitely your choice to make. I\u2019ve always said a similar thing about my funeral. I want to be cremated and I don\u2019t want family to see my body in a box or otherwise. That is not the last way I want to be remembered.  So I can understand you. Just do your best to explain your feelings to your family and ask them to try to understand and respect your decision. Not everyone gets to make end of life decisions and I don\u2019t think any of us really knows what we would do unless faced with the same circumstances. I\u2019m so sorry you are facing this now, but it gives a small amount of peace that you have come to terms with it and you are making your own choices. My thoughts are with you.", "1) they will have their chance to say goodbye/process at your funeral, they don\u2019t need to be present at your deathbed to get those things\n\n2) you might consider writing a letter or making a video to explain your reasoning, or if you have any final words you\u2019d like for them to have in the future if you\u2019re up for it", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry about your diagnosis. When you explain this to your loved ones, that you don't want people there, explain it exactly like you did here. \n\nMy aunt did the same thing. She didn't want people there either. Not only did she not want us to see her like that and remember her like that but she also didn't want to see the pain on our faces because as she put it \"I have no words to ease your pain. My words wouldn't bring you comfort. I won't even know if I'll be able to talk clearly. It will only hurt me to see you in so much pain and not be able to help you. I want to go remembering the smiles on your faces and be able to smile just recalling them\". She did have a couple people there but they didn't cry while they were in the room with her. They sat around talking to her and each other laughing about all the shenanigans they got into when they were younger.  And you know what? She did pass away with a smile.", "This made me cry. You're  Nta. My ex has been diagnosed with brain cancer and its tough. But, it's your life and death to live out how you want. Wishing you a safe journey to your next one.", "NAH\n\nBut FYI it is not like their good memories of you go away because they see you dying from some disease. \n\nDad passed from an \"interaction\" with his immuno therapy for skin cancer. Yeah the leading drug...  saw him through the end. 99.999% of my memories of him are not of that last week and last moments. \n\nIn reality what would have helped more to me would have been him accepting more help and time with him rather than pushing me away when I wanted to help or spend time. The knowledge, history and experiences I wish he could had told me more about are now unobtainable. I just wanted to hang out in the end of his journey.\n\n\nMaybe while you still can interact insist on more 1 on 1 contact and only a larger group with you at the very end... \n\nWithout details its tough to speculate if you will be like the guy in Metallica's song one in the end or something else......", "Not to mention the feelings OP is feeling right now might be much different than the feeling they have during their last hours, or even minutes. Most people don't want to die alone, they get scared before they catch on to peace.", "At the risk of sounding like an AH myself, that sounds like a problem that's on them to resolve, not OP.  If passing alone is what OP wishes, then it's what OP wishes.  And the family are well within their rights to not like it and not agree with it however it's also on them to make their way to peace about it.  All the \"yeah but what about your family\" sentiment in some comments just feels dismissive of OP's decision.", "If my child did that to me, I'd spend the rest of my life wondering what I did so wrong that they didn't even want to let me say goodbye to them. \n\nIt is your life though, so obviously do what you want to. I just wanted to give my perspective. I'm sorry that you're going through this.", "It's a fair point but OP seems to be trying to do this almost to protect the family memories, therefore it's worth pointing out it could have the opposite effect.\n\nAt the end of the day though it should be what's most comfortable for OP."]}
