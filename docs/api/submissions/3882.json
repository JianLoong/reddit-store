Safe journey.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your death in the same way as it's your life.

Whilst it is nice that you want your loved ones to remember you fondly and as healthy and energetic as possible, the fact is that your loved ones are the ones who will be left behind and will be the ones who will live with whichever choices are made. They will be the ones grieving, and will be the ones who will want as much time with you as possible as they know that this is very limited. Even with your wishes, there will be people who will feel guilt that you passed away alone and some people can't live with that thought because they themselves may feel that they would never want to die alone.\n\nThis is a heartbreaking situation which involves delicately balancing the wishes of someone with limited time alive (you), and people who will have to live with the outcomes for many years to come. \n\nI note that you have been receiving therapy for your situation and it has helped- it might be worth having sessions with your brother, to hear each other's feelings in a neutral environment with a professional. Given that he is the only one aware of your prognosis, it is a lonely time for him as he has nobody to talk to so therapy with you both could help a lot.", "NAH.

Your brother definitely will feel horrible either way: if he tells the rest of the family, he'll be betraying you, but if he keeps your secret, the family might blame him. He might become the target of a lot of misplaced negativity after you've passed away. Your family might not remember what you were like in your final days, but they will be dealing with a harrowing reality that is potentially worse than if they'd been able to say goodbye.  \n\nSo no, OP, you're not an asshole.

I am so sorry for the diagnosis you've been forced to face, and I wish you comfort and peace on your journey.  You have the right to choose the specifics of your wishes, and I do understand your viewpoint.  People do handle such traumatic experiences in different ways.  I didn't get to say goodbye to my husband, when he passed unexpectedly, and I still feel the sorrow of that, over 20 yrs later.  My parents, I was with both on the night they passed.  Both were extremely ill, but it wasn't how they appeared that stayed in mind.  I still remember the life we shared, not the devastating illness.  But it brought me tremendous peace in being able to whisper what my heart felt, even though they were both in deep comas and likely never heard.  People often need to process letting someone go, in stages.  As you said, you'll be gone, anyway.

Either way, you need to do it your way.  \\*hugs\\*", "Sorry to hear this but it's your wishes and nta.\n\nYour rationale matches that of my aunt and dad. They didn't want many visitors in the end.

If they had any real connection in life, they would have made it over their lifetime.", "Of course NTA. I'm only sharing this in hopes of giving you some insight on your family's position.  When I was young my Mom got terminal cancer. Everyone in my family decided it was best I didn't know so I spent her last years oblivious to the fact we were on borrowed time. I was a little kid but seeing my Mom lose her hair, weight, etc. It never affected me. She always looked the same to me. She was always just my Mom. After she passed I was so angry with my family when I found out they knew all along she was going to die. I would have spent so much more time with her, I would have told her so many things I wish I could now. I felt and still feel robbed of such an important decision that was made for me by my family. \n\nAll you're family cares about is you. When I remember my Mom it's as she was before she got sick. Thats how I picture her in my mind when I think of her..thats how Ill always picture her. \n\nI'm so sorry you are going through this. Whatever you choose to do will be the right choice no matter what", "NTA, this is an extremely hard situation that YOU have to endure so ultimately what decisions are made are yours and yours alone \n\nWith that said, the living will continue on.

I hope you make the most of it for all of you. Take care.", "NTA- I get why they may want to be there, but you're the one actually living with this. You get to decide how you want to spend your life.

She (mom) didn\u2019t tell us she was dying, and I never got to speak with her about it because of the state she was in. I was my fianc\u00e9\u2019s caretaker so was with him as much as possible. I have a lot of regret surrounding the loss of my mother. But, even though losing my fianc\u00e9 was harder, I feel like I did everything I could. \n\nYou are able to make whatever decision you want.

We are in fluctuating states of death and regeneration physically and emotionally. People have moved so far from this reality. We hide Death from Ourselves and Others as if it is shameful. It is part of LIFE. Just as we should all be granted the right to live with dignity, we should be granted the right to die with dignity. So if having dignity means being alone, honour that for yourself. There is no shame in weaving those moments in solitude before picking up the threads of the dream you were having before your first breath. Quiet contemplation can be a beautiful way to end the waking dream.  \n\n\nHowever, you cannot decide how others will remember you. You can certainly choose to not create certain memories by forgoing the companionship and love of others in those moments where dignity feels like a dream.
