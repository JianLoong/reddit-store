Good job getting the money back for your mom.  They wouldn't have ben humiliated if they had paid what they owed in a decent amount of time so that's on them.

They frequently ask your mom for money but refuse to pay her back and when she says anything about it they get upset. Also, if they can afford to live extravagantly then they don\u2019t need to be borrowing money to begin with. Regarding the public shaming - they wouldn\u2019t be embarrassed if there was nothing to be embarrassed about. They want to appear on social media as if they live this extravagant lifestyle meanwhile they\u2019re refusing to pay backs a relative who needs the money. Shame on them! I do think your mom needs to stop letting people borrow money. These people will continue to use her if she continues to allow it. Moving forward, she shouldn\u2019t let them borrow money again, she\u2019s done enough to help out and it\u2019s time they learn to help themselves.", "NTA. You stood up for your mom when she was in no position to. Deadbeats, related or not, get no pass.", "Nta Good plan", "NTA, I would do the same thing. If they did the right thing in the first place then you wouldn\u2019t have had to go to that level. Sounds like they will always blame others, probably going to have to get use to it.", "NTA, if they start complaining about it just tell them you sent them an message already but they missed it so you had to reach out in a different way.", "NTA. Obviously simply asking to be paid back was not working so you did what you had to do.", "NTA. A good piece of advice my mom gave me. Never lend anything you can't afford to give. So when I \"lend\" money, it's always a gift. If it comes back, that's cool. If not, that's cool too. Tell your mom that she's awesome for being there for people, but it's time to stop lending anything.", "NTA for forcing people to pay back money that they effectively stole. \n\nI wonder, are you surprised that they\u2019re angry at you? Of course they\u2019re angry. You publicly harassed and humiliated them to regain a debt. It\u2019s their fault for being thieves, but it should be expected that they would disagree. There was no possible outcome in which you got paid without them being mad at you. \n\nI hope you will continue to encourage your mom to stop loaning out money to unreliable people if she can\u2019t afford to lose it.", "NTA.  Bonus points because you did this for your mom.", "NTA, you and your mom tried to settle things privately and they ignored you. In this case, they\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t do more than that like call a lawyer or something more extreme.", "NTA.  Why should you care about the hurt feelings of deadbeats who could pay their debts but choose not to?  You tried private reminders to no effect, and the public-shaming route worked.", "But don't, cuz we don't need more ER...", "Meh, NTA.  Sometimes you got to let the inner Tony out: \"fuck you, pay me.\"", "Wow. Delusional much? \n\n\"Sure, calling them out publicly isn't the best move by any means\"\n\nReally?\n\n\"But it sounds like that was a last resort\"\n\nYes, obviously. Which is the best move considering it's the last resort.\n\n\"I'd suggest your mom gets an attorney\"\n\nMadness, she NEEDS money to pay for surgery. What are we paying the attorney with? Thoughts and prayers? \n\nOP got their mom her money back that she needs for medical reasons (surgery!).", "With what money?", "This is not how POA works.", "\"calling them out in public is not cool\"\n\nWhyyyy? Why is it \"not cool\"? When she needs the money for surgery and they ignored the private requests for the money to be paid back? \n\nTheir actions met their consequences. \n\nAlso, as a Brit, I can confidently say that's not how power of attorney works. You should KNOW how it works considering you're referencing it", "In Canada it is.", "In Canada it is. \n\nI'm not knowing how POA works in Britain. \n\nDon't claim to.", "Oh right.\n\nYou called OP an asshole though. Is the situation in this post occurring in Canada then?", "NTA and great move, i hate hypocrisy. Now to your mom, tell her she has to stop this and give her the medical emergency example, she needed the money but didn't have it and they just used her.", "They deserve the humiliation. Glad they paid her back.", "They were also able to afford to buy a brand new car which really ticked me off.", "Another thing to add- I'm from the Philippines so $2k is really a lot of money here. It's equivalent to about 100k + in PH pesos.", "That ratio got me chuckling lol nice one", "Not really sure this is the best thing to be pedantic with.\n\nIf OP needed to publicly humiliate people to get them to pay back a loan, they're NTA.", "I wanted to after they paid but they blocked me already.", "Awesome!
