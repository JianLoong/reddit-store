I showed him a corporate pamphlet and explained how to apply. He seemed nice enough and asked to use a cell phone charger. I didn\u2019t think twice to hand the changer over the counter to let him charge up a bit and figured he\u2019d be on his way. However, I was wrong. \n\nLet\u2019s call him Corey. Corey decided to stay and chat. I\u2019m great at chatting, typically not a huge deal, however, I\u2019m running a private retail store alone - he\u2019s talking to me while I\u2019m tending to other customers and clientele. Talking to me while I\u2019m checking them out at the POS. Talking to me about ever gd thing we have on the shelf. He tells me he took a bus to my state from states away with nothing but the clothes he has on and a \u201cgood feeling\u201d that fell thru. His place to stay and job fell thru but he doesn\u2019t want to go home. He wants to know if he can stay at my apt with me, to which I politely and gently decline. I don\u2019t know this person. At all. Again I\u2019m trying to work and now I can\u2019t get anything done elsewhere in the store because I\u2019ve gotta keep Corey in eyeshot. He asks me for cash to which I have none. I have 78\u00a2 leftover from the Red Bull I bought on my way into work.\n\nWell Corey stayed until we closed, 4 hours later. By the grace of some higher power, he stepped outside to make a call and I quietly locked the door behind him so I could actually close my store and count my registers/access the safe without a stranger lingering. I feel guilt but I also started to feel unsafe. I have my own issues with men and have been previously attacked, but I wasn\u2019t about to call the cops because he hadn\u2019t *really* done anything he just stayed in a retail store shadowing a small woman for 4.5 hours. Corey eventually showed up at the doors again and saw me thru them and tried to come in and was like \u201cAww what the hell?\u201d and pulled at the locked doors again. I explained I can\u2019t have him in while I count my cash down and he gave me such a guilt trip saying he\u2019s gonna get arrested for staying on the street. I apologized but said I had to finished what I was doing.

There's something wrong with Corey, and that could make him dangerous. Corey is desperate. That could also make him dangerous. \n\nBetter safe than sorry. Make a plan to get rid of him faster if he comes back. Let your coworkers know about him.", "NTA. It was very lucky that he stepped outside the store and you were able to lock it behind him. If something like this ever happens again, please either call a friend, relative or the police to meet you after work and escort you to your car long before closing time ever comes around. That way, you have back up if you need to ask someone to leave the store so you can close. It's not silly to want to be safe, and when someone makes you uncomfortable, heed that feeling.  \n\nI would also text or email your boss (don't call so there's a written record) and let them know what happened. Ask for permission to have someone you know stay in the store with you while you close if it happens again. Some retail places have rules against anyone staying after close who isn't an employee, but I believe exceptions should be made for employee safety. \n\nMy last suggestion is that you get a can of pepper spray and carry it in your hand as you leave the store after work each night. Don't think of it as paranoia, but as preparation.", "NTA \n\nThis guy is borderline stalking you and is looking to take advantage - by staying at your place, obtaining money, etc. \nThen when you say no he acts all affronted. Classic gaslighting user behaviour. \n\nHe is up to no good. Be careful and watch out.  Trust your instincts.\n\nAre you in a mall? Can you advise security or have them on call?", "NTA\n\n>  he\u2019s gonna get arrested for staying on the street. \n\nNot your problem. If he used his brain it wouldn't be his problem either. \n\nHe was hoping you would bring him back to your place? He was hoping you'd let him sleep on the floor of the store?\n\nHe spent 4.5 hours in the store rather than finding solutions to his problem because he thought you were the solution to his problem. It was a scam attempt at best.", "Definitely not the ahole. He Definitely seemed up to no good.", "Definitely NTA!! That was a dangerous situation.  A stranger is asking you to go back to your apartment? That's crazy. I'm glad you were able to lock the door after he stepped out. You feel bad because you are a good person,  but his requests weren't realistic. He stayed all shift, taking up all your time, wanted to go to your home? He sounds disturbed. You dodged a bullet.", "NTA. You were in the store alone and trying to do your job, whereas Corey was looking for someone to talk to and being inappropriate (asking if he could stay at your apartment, etc.) and interfering with you while you are trying to help other customers. 4+ hours bothering an employee is definitely not normal behavior, and you are certainly not obligated to let anyone in after closing. You have no way of knowing what he would do if you were alone with him locked in the store. Not only is this a safety issue for you, but you could get in trouble with the store's owners.", "That was clearly a creepy behavior.\n\nCould be harmless but Could also have ended dangerously.\n\nThe fact that He after half an hour asked to stay in your Appartment and asked for Money is a big huge Red flag. Staying for 4 more hours is creepy.\n\nYou did good to use the Chance you Had to Lock the door. Every normal Person should have gotten the Message by then that they overstayed their Welcome yet He still pushed.\n\nDid you Drive Home or Walk? Made Sure He did Not follow you Home? \n\nNot trying to scare you Here but id advise you Look carefully around next time you leave Home to make Sure He is not around. If you See him anywhere Close to your Home call the Police right away. Ask a friend to Pick you Up from Work the next few days Just to be on the save Side in Case Hes watching you or coming to your Store again.\n\nBetter to be safe then sorry cause his behavior does give very creepy vibes.\n\nNTA at all and dont feel guilty for Beeing careful.", "NTA. I\u2019d have kicked him out much earlier. He\u2019s a bum trying to creepily take advantage of you. He shouldn\u2019t be allowed in the store again unless he\u2019s planning to buy something.", "NTA.  When he began interrupting your work, it\u2019s fine to ask him to leave.  The more time went by, the creepier he got. You would have been fine threatening to call the cops yourself if he didn\u2019t leave.", "Loitering is illegal and you could absolutely call the cops in this situation", "Absolutely not the AH! Never feel bad for keeping yourself safe!! Creepy and weird!", "What a scary situation! I am glad you were able to lock the doors on him and you weren't harmed. Asking if he could stay with you, is a huge red flag! No telling what mindset this person had or what he planned on doing. Always go with your gut!  I can't stand companies that think it is okay to have an employee work by themselves. It can be quite dangerous and risky. NTA", "Seriously what? I was going to write that I don\u2019t understand why you were so desperate to be nice to this absolutely sketchy guy, but I do understand - as women, we\u2019re socialised to absolutely take care of everyone. \n\nThis guy\u2019s problems were not your problems. You were nice enough to chat for FOUR HOURS with this guy who asked you for money!! \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure I would have asked him to leave at minute 30.\n\nAlso, you need to treat this as a bullet dodged- the next situation like this might not end so well.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Something very similar happened to me a few years ago.  I still don't know what his intentions were and I do still feel guilty for not helping but as I walked away I realized he was only asking women for a place to stay.  By chance did he have an accent?  I'm American and live in a place that's not a place that tourists come to, so I was very confused why this European guy was harassing me in my town.", "I am the first one to say you ought to help someone out if they need it regardless of whether they are strangers or not.\n\nBut that means cab fare or a burger or helping them carry stuff. That doesn't mean letting them move in.\n\nYou were more than cool by letting him charge his phone and hang out.\n\nNTA", "Remember, it can take years to gain a good customer and only seconds to lose them.
