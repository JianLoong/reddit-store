I was there as well as Mary\u2019s father and my husband are colleagues.\n\nThe issue? Mary\u2019s mother, Joan. She was definitely a mother of the bride-zilla. Joan in general is not a pleasant person. She\u2019s very snobby, rude and a bit of a control freak. \n\nAt every event she was snapping  it\u2019s Mary\u2019s day and they better not question anything. Mary wasn\u2019t a bridezilla but there were definitely times where she was a little blinded by her day effecting others. They had a jam packed bachelorette weekend and many of the bridal party were tired, tried voicing that they needed a break in between activities. Joan would loudly say that they could suck it up and it\u2019s Mary\u2019s day. \n\nThe final straw for Ariana was the day of. Mary had told the girls they could do their hair, makeup and accessorize however they wanted. Ariana wanted to wear a necklace that complimented her dress. She admits her one fault is that she didn\u2019t clear it with Mary first but again given she was told anything goes, she could wear it. It was a simple black choker with a few teardrop black beads. It was similar to this[this](https://www.amazon.com/TseanYi-Necklace-Teardrop-Necklaces-Victorian/dp/B0B63WT6P5) but not lace. I was here for this as I had to drop off Mary\u2019s something blue. \n\n\nMary seemed hesitant on it and she could tell she was trying to find a way to tactfully say she wasn\u2019t sure about it. Joan jumped in and rudely said \u201cYeah, no, take that off right now.\u201d The issue to me and Ariana was not Mary not liking the necklace but Joan butting in and being rude about it.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a pressing issue going forward but it did stick with me. Last month, Ariana got married. She did end up inviting Joan as she felt obligated. I disagreed, but her day, her wedding.\n\nI\u2019m probably going to sound biased but from what I saw, Ariana was a good friend during her wedding planning. Let bridesmaids pick dresses, had a simple, affordable bachelorette, etc. There were times she started teetering into bridezilla territory, but I pulled her back and reminded her yeah it\u2019s her and her fianc\u00e9s day, but she also needs to remember she also wants to have friends after this wedding. It worked and she went back to the girl I know.\n\nAnyway, day of, everything went well. Joan and I were making polite small talk. She noted that I seemed very relaxed. I said yes, it\u2019s Ariana\u2019s wedding and I don\u2019t want to stress her or her bridal party. I admit I pointedly said \u201cIt really sucks when weddings turn people into mother of the bridezillas and they\u2019re snapping at people over necklaces\u201d.\n\nJoan walked away. Later, my husband approached me and said Joan was bitching to her husband about this \u201cslight\u201d. He says I should\u2019ve just said thank you. Joan didn\u2019t make a scene and Ariana wasn\u2019t even aware of the comment. \n\nTo me, it deserved to be said. Joan can dish it but can\u2019t take? But I can concede this wasn\u2019t the place.

You dished on her by making a passive aggressive comment to her reasonable conversation. You are still bristling over her behaviour at her own daughter's wedding.

While Joan may have been unpleasant, rude, and controlling during her daughter's wedding, your comment at your daughter's wedding was not necessary and served no purpose except to insult and upset her. Your daughter's wedding was not the time or place to bring up something that happened at another wedding.

Ariana and Mary are 28 years old married women, it's high time for you and Joan to stop being so overinvolved and to grow the fuck up.

Joan for making a shitty comment, Ariana for wanting to wear a tacky necklace at a formal event (which very likely would\u2019ve stood out at the altar which is a  h u g e  no), and you for making a snide comment about something that happened years ago.

You're right, it wasn't the place. In that moment, Joan wasn't being rude with you, and you were at your daughter's *wedding*.

To be blunt, that necklace looks like its $10 and from a Hot Topic's clearance bin. It's definitely not appropriate for a bridesmaid. Mary seems like she might have a hard time standing up for herself since your daughter thought she could get away with wearing that necklace in the first place, and Mary was struggling to say no.

So Joan got put in her place. Boohoo", "ESH But what you said was soooooo out of line", "The remark was rude AF. Nobody should be ordered around like that. Joan was way out of line and OP should have addressed it right then and there, later that night, or the next time she saw Joan. \n\nIt\u2019s odd she turned around and did to Joan the same thing she is upset about in the first place.", "There should be a \u201cjustified asshole\u201d judgement option \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc", "And I want to add that Mary seems to be very passive and her mother Joan was probably standing up for her on her behalf. \n\nNo she should not have come out and said it like that, but OP\u2019s remarks that Joan would step in and tell everyone it\u2019s about Mary, makes me feel like she\u2019s just advocating for someone who may usually let people have their way. \n\nShe went a bit far, but it just sounds like she wanted her daughter to have a happy, stress-free time.", "That's why I gave the bridesmaids jewelry to wear with their outfits.", "OP could have too considering it was a couple years ago"]}
