I was there as well as Mary\u2019s father and my husband are colleagues.\n\nThe issue? Mary\u2019s mother, Joan. She was definitely a mother of the bride-zilla. Joan in general is not a pleasant person. She\u2019s very snobby, rude and a bit of a control freak. \n\nAt every event she was snapping  it\u2019s Mary\u2019s day and they better not question anything. Mary wasn\u2019t a bridezilla but there were definitely times where she was a little blinded by her day effecting others. They had a jam packed bachelorette weekend and many of the bridal party were tired, tried voicing that they needed a break in between activities. Joan would loudly say that they could suck it up and it\u2019s Mary\u2019s day. \n\nThe final straw for Ariana was the day of. Mary had told the girls they could do their hair, makeup and accessorize however they wanted. Ariana wanted to wear a necklace that complimented her dress. She admits her one fault is that she didn\u2019t clear it with Mary first but again given she was told anything goes, she could wear it. It was a simple black choker with a few teardrop black beads. It was similar to this[this](https://www.amazon.com/TseanYi-Necklace-Teardrop-Necklaces-Victorian/dp/B0B63WT6P5) but not lace. I was here for this as I had to drop off Mary\u2019s something blue. \n\n\nMary seemed hesitant on it and she could tell she was trying to find a way to tactfully say she wasn\u2019t sure about it. Joan jumped in and rudely said \u201cYeah, no, take that off right now.\u201d The issue to me and Ariana was not Mary not liking the necklace but Joan butting in and being rude about it.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a pressing issue going forward but it did stick with me. Last month, Ariana got married. She did end up inviting Joan as she felt obligated. I disagreed, but her day, her wedding.\n\nI\u2019m probably going to sound biased but from what I saw, Ariana was a good friend during her wedding planning. Let bridesmaids pick dresses, had a simple, affordable bachelorette, etc. There were times she started teetering into bridezilla territory, but I pulled her back and reminded her yeah it\u2019s her and her fianc\u00e9s day, but she also needs to remember she also wants to have friends after this wedding. It worked and she went back to the girl I know.\n\nAnyway, day of, everything went well. Joan and I were making polite small talk. She noted that I seemed very relaxed. I said yes, it\u2019s Ariana\u2019s wedding and I don\u2019t want to stress her or her bridal party. I admit I pointedly said \u201cIt really sucks when weddings turn people into mother of the bridezillas and they\u2019re snapping at people over necklaces\u201d.\n\nJoan walked away. Later, my husband approached me and said Joan was bitching to her husband about this \u201cslight\u201d. He says I should\u2019ve just said thank you. Joan didn\u2019t make a scene and Ariana wasn\u2019t even aware of the comment. \n\nTo me, it deserved to be said. Joan can dish it but can\u2019t take? But I can concede this wasn\u2019t the place.

The dictionary definition of pettiness.", "ESH\n\nWe don't need to explain why Joan was the AH but Mary's wedding was years ago. I understand you were hurt or angry at the way your daughter was spoken to, but it wasn't exactly necessary in this situation. I get why you did what you did, but you could have let it slide.", "You were good right up until \u201c\u2026and they\u2019re snapping at people over necklaces.\u201d Until you said those words, it was a generic statement and Joan wouldn\u2019t have had a leg to stand on in terms of complaining. \n\nESH.

So, high-five for the burn and YTA.", "Just not the time or place.", "YTA and that necklace was nowhere near wedding appropriate.", "NTA - Sounds like someone isn't used to being held accountable for their actions.", "YTA She wasn't dishing. You dished on her by making a passive aggressive comment to her reasonable conversation. You are still bristling over her behaviour at her own daughter's wedding. You've been simmering about it and so made a passive aggressive snap at her. That is not Joan can dish it, but cannot take it. This isn't a tit for tat.", "Okay well, ESH but soooo justified. I would have had to leave the room if I overheard this to laugh my butt off so maybe I'm an ahole too and I definitely can't blame you.", "YTA. While Joan may have been unpleasant, rude, and controlling during her daughter's wedding, your comment at your daughter's wedding was not necessary and served no purpose except to insult and upset her. Your daughter's wedding was not the time or place to bring up something that happened at another wedding. You could have chosen to ignore her or politely engage in small talk without bringing up a past incident. Instead, you chose to be confrontational and rude, which only added unnecessary tension to the day.", "NTA.", "I'm proud of you.  I would have done the same thing.  She obviously wasn't going to make a scene at the wedding and you got a good dig in.  Good for you.\n\nJust my opinion.  I've dealt with lots of people like that.", "NTA \n\nWell, Joan did act like the momzilla of the bride at her daughter\u2019s wedding. She had it coming to her somewhere sometime.\n\nBut, you could have commented this to Joan a few months after her daughter\u2019s wedding. Why wait all these years?", "YTA I want on my side.", "YTA that was rude. Other people's bad behavior does not justify your own", "YTA but I'm still on your side because I would have been an AH too in this instance.", "NTA. Some people think they can get away with murder, and rely on the politeness of others to not confront them about their bad behavior. \n\nThese people don't deserve politeness.", "What comes around, goes around. NTA", "YTA - why would you start unnecessary drama, on your daughter\u2019s wedding day, with someone that she was clear that she wanted to invite? What a selfish, s***-starting, \u201cI\u2019m the main character\u201d thing to do! Yikes.", "NTA\n\nI like people who speak their mind and say what they are thinking. From what you have described, you and she have a cordial relationship. You stated your opinion on an issue that matters to you. That doesn't make you ta. She took offense (did it hit home?), and whined about it. Still doesn't make you ta.", "NTA.  Interesting how bullies can make folks miserable, but are terribly upset when the energy is returned.  Disregard all the YTA\u2019s.  She could have let it go but went whining to her husband.", "INFO -\"Ariana wanted to wear a necklace that complimented her dress.\" But did it really bring out the color of her eyes?", "YTA. The necklace was tacky, and if someone wore something to your daughter\u2019s wedding that she didn\u2019t like, we all know your claws would have come out too.", "NTA.", "Nta", "YTA. Smug, nasty and trashy response for the sole reason of causing drama like some 16 year old mean girl.", "YTA you could have started a huge fight. Luckily Joan chose to act classy and walk away. Unlike you.", "Come on, obviously YTA, and admit it \u2014 you were TRYING to be an asshole. It sounds like a great burn and Joan doesn\u2019t sound like someone worth shedding a tear over but lol yes saying an obviously pointed insulted at someone during an otherwise polite moment is an asshole move if there ever was one. What did you think was going to happen? She would laugh it off? She wasn\u2019t going to think it was about her?

Mary got married a few years ago. You should have resolved that a long time ago, either by finding a way to approach Joan about your feelings at some date after Mary's wedding, or by letting it go and moving on. Throwing it in her face in an opportune moment on Ariana's day didn't make you look good. It made you look vindictive.
