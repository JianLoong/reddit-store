I was there as well as Mary\u2019s father and my husband are colleagues.\n\nThe issue? Mary\u2019s mother, Joan. She was definitely a mother of the bride-zilla. Joan in general is not a pleasant person. She\u2019s very snobby, rude and a bit of a control freak. \n\nAt every event she was snapping  it\u2019s Mary\u2019s day and they better not question anything. Mary wasn\u2019t a bridezilla but there were definitely times where she was a little blinded by her day effecting others. They had a jam packed bachelorette weekend and many of the bridal party were tired, tried voicing that they needed a break in between activities. Joan would loudly say that they could suck it up and it\u2019s Mary\u2019s day. \n\nThe final straw for Ariana was the day of. Mary had told the girls they could do their hair, makeup and accessorize however they wanted. Ariana wanted to wear a necklace that complimented her dress. She admits her one fault is that she didn\u2019t clear it with Mary first but again given she was told anything goes, she could wear it. It was a simple black choker with a few teardrop black beads. It was similar to this[this](https://www.amazon.com/TseanYi-Necklace-Teardrop-Necklaces-Victorian/dp/B0B63WT6P5) but not lace. I was here for this as I had to drop off Mary\u2019s something blue. \n\n\nMary seemed hesitant on it and she could tell she was trying to find a way to tactfully say she wasn\u2019t sure about it. Joan jumped in and rudely said \u201cYeah, no, take that off right now.\u201d The issue to me and Ariana was not Mary not liking the necklace but Joan butting in and being rude about it.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a pressing issue going forward but it did stick with me. Last month, Ariana got married. She did end up inviting Joan as she felt obligated. I disagreed, but her day, her wedding.\n\nI\u2019m probably going to sound biased but from what I saw, Ariana was a good friend during her wedding planning. Let bridesmaids pick dresses, had a simple, affordable bachelorette, etc. There were times she started teetering into bridezilla territory, but I pulled her back and reminded her yeah it\u2019s her and her fianc\u00e9s day, but she also needs to remember she also wants to have friends after this wedding. It worked and she went back to the girl I know.\n\nAnyway, day of, everything went well. Joan and I were making polite small talk. She noted that I seemed very relaxed. I said yes, it\u2019s Ariana\u2019s wedding and I don\u2019t want to stress her or her bridal party. I admit I pointedly said \u201cIt really sucks when weddings turn people into mother of the bridezillas and they\u2019re snapping at people over necklaces\u201d.\n\nJoan walked away. Later, my husband approached me and said Joan was bitching to her husband about this \u201cslight\u201d. He says I should\u2019ve just said thank you. Joan didn\u2019t make a scene and Ariana wasn\u2019t even aware of the comment. \n\nTo me, it deserved to be said. Joan can dish it but can\u2019t take? But I can concede this wasn\u2019t the place.

Had brides hateful old ass mother said that to me I would have been real petty with a smile on my face and left. As I was leaving I would have let her know learn to control your mother and her mouth. Whether the necklace was ugly or not Joan the batalacks should not have been so nasty. So she got what she deserved. People that live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. In other words if you can't take what comes back at you then you need not leave the porch.", "ESH.   \nI was going to say YTA, but.... I mean, I think this is a case of where it's totally justified to be TA? \ud83d\ude06", "NTA\n\nI think it was exactly the right place & time.", "This is a ok to be an AH.  I love that you did that.  You didn't yell , or threaten you were perfectly petty .   Internet high five!   Sure you could of been the biggest person but truthfully Joan set herself up for it.", "Oh boy, technically you were the rude one with that remark that was also, mostly out of nowhere, so the answer would be yes YTA, but I say you still should not be held fully accountable specially since you were not disruptive to anything and her reaction shows that your remark was true, specially with the fact she said her remark on a clause of \"anything goes\"", "You should probably consider becoming about 80% less involved in your grown-ass daughter's interpersonal affairs, tbh", "I\u2019m petty 24/7 and patient so yeah I\u2019d have said it to. NTA", "yta for not telling your daughter how awful that necklace was to begin with. you would think as an adult she could make that decision on her own, but since y\u2019all seem very weirdly codependant you shoudlve stepped in to remind her she was going to a wedding, not an evanescence concert in 2005.", "Hahahahaha I\u2019m petty like that to but you shouldn\u2019t have mentioned the necklace thing. She still would\u2019ve gotten the hint though lol", "Esh - except for Mary and Ariana. Joan for her behavior, you for a time to cause drama when it was long over.", "That's honestly what I was thinking, especially when the first bride didn't seem to be a big fan of the necklace.", "I didn't want to say this, in fear of becoming an asshole on an AITA post, but my god was this necklace butt ugly and I would low key rip it off my friend's neck and throw it in the trash. Unless this was a sweet sixteen wedding, then carry on.", "What is with people on this sub acting like they didn't say something they clearly said,.that you can literally scroll up and see proof of them saying. Like what?", "It's certainly not limited to this sub, that's for sure :)", "YTA. you know it wasn\u2019t the place and given the extensive backstory you also know how lucky your \u201cdeserved comment\u201d wasn\u2019t blown up into a pithy bitching match. You\u2019re lucky it\u2019s a small detail in an otherwise joyous evening. \n\nCongratulations to your daughter, and I hope your interactions with someone who sounds exhausting don\u2019t have to occur again.", "YTA If you\u2019re old enough to have a 28yr old daughter then you\u2019re old enough to know that it was just in completely poor taste to make such a petty comment at your daughter\u2019s wedding! We all like to be petty but, it was Your Daughter\u2019s Day!!!", "Of course you are an ass, as is she. You gained nothing but picking a fight, and making the day about one upping someone else. Now you will remember your daughters wedding day a a day you were petty", "YTA, I get that you don\u2019t like the way your daughter was spoken to years ago, but you probably should have said something years ago after the wedding was over\u2026 also for the record the necklace your daughter wanted to wear, was hideous for a wedding,", "At least she didn't make a scene. NTA.", "I sort of feel like YTA but like I don\u2019t care because Joan was a heifer.", "NTA. It\u2019s your daughter\u2019s day and no mother forgets how their kids are treated. Good job on the clapback \ud83e\udd23", "NTA. Hey what goes around comes around. (\u2060\u25e0\u2060\u203f\u2060\u25d5\u2060)", "NTA. You did well.", "I mean... \\*very light\\* YTA here... you didn't need to go there. Even if you had just left it at a vague reference to mother-of-the-bride stuff, I'd say, NTA... but no... you got specific. That's where you became the AH. This was extremely petty, and unnecessary.", "ESH. Joan sounds rude and overbearing, but OP also held a grudge about something relatively minor for years and brought it up at her daughter\u2019s wedding. Petty and not the place. Both these mothers strike me as helicopter moms to their adult daughters. I\u2019d say they\u2019re about the same.", "Passive aggressive is the biggest bunch of bullshit on earth.", "right/wrong has NOTHING to do with asshole/not asshole\n\nI don't get how people dont understand that\n\nright/wrong= what. asshole/not asshole = how/why"]}
