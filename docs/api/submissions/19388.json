Seconds go on the same plate unless it is a restaurant that has to worry about that stuff.", "Next time she's eating, wait until she's taken a single bite then take the plate away because it's been used and it's dirty.", "Do you live at a Golden Corral buffet?\n\nNobody gets a clean plate for a second helping at home, nobody.\n\nso I hope you've learned a lesson here.  Sister can get her own food.  NTA", "Wtaf I\u2019ve never met anyone who gets a clean plate for seconds\u2026 for dessert I get it, but not for seconds of the same meal. Absolutely NTA", "NTA -if she is going to  wash all the dishes properly then by all means, she can use as many plates and dishes as she wants", "NTA is she washing the dishes? Does she feel like she is at a buffet? \nAny time I have a second helping I use the same plate.", "Definitely NTA. This is insane logic and wreaks of entitlement ... I can't even think of a time this would be normal in a private home, unless she's just incredibly wealthy and is used to being pampered.\n\nNext time she wants seconds she can get it her damn self, and wash her own plate in between. \n\nIf it were me I would probably never invite her over for another meal.", "NTA\n\nYou want a clean plate for every serving, aka buffet style?\n\nYou pay buffet prices, $17.95 all you can eat.", "Wtf? Who dirties up another plate for literally no reason? That's the dumbest thing I've heard today.", "NTA. \n\nDoes your sister throw out her toothbrush after using it once?", "NTA. Next time she need to get her own plate.", "Bro who washes a plate just to get seconds?", "NTA, obviously, don\u2019t really need to explain do I?", "I'm saying NTA.  Who the heck *wants* to create more dirty dishes?", "NTA\nyou are having a family meal\nNot a tablecloth Michelin star dining experience", "NTA - second helping are usually put in the plate of the person who asked for them - i don\u2019t think I even have enough plates for 8 or  10 people to have a new plate for every extra potion if they want seconds (as people almost always do).", "NTA. She's being utterly ridiculous.", "Unless you're at a buffet you're supposed to eat off your same fucking plate. Otherwise I just makes more dishes or trash if you're using paper plates for someone else\n\nThat's just freaking ridiculous\n\n\nNta", "NTA who expects a new plate when they get second servings? That's such a waste to have to clean another dish when it's the same food and person eating off it.", "NTA. I have never heard of getting a fresh plate with a second helping of food. What?", "NTA. Your sister is a tool", "NTA. Next time at least give it a rinse in the toilet and wipe it down with an old towel you used to clean the floor. After that the plate will be sparkling and up to her standards.", "Did she lick it ? If not , this is nonsense.", "NTA. The only time I've gotten a clean plate for second helpings is at a restaurant buffet where it's required.", "NTA. I think when you have dinner at her house in the future you should just help yourself to half a dozen clean plates to eat many small servings. I'm sure she won't mind all the dishes, you were just following the rules.", "What\u2026\nNTA", "YTA. Next time, give her a clean plate to avoid any potential messy situations.", "NTA She was being ridiculous. \nShe just ate off the same damn plate.", "NTA. Why didn\u2019t the sister serve herself?", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s a house, not a buffet.", "This isn't a buffet line NTA", "NTA. Obviously. And that can\u2019t be the first time she\u2019s ever had second so she should know. She\u2019s crazy.", "NTA. You don't dirty an extra plate as a guest, that's rude. Unless you're doing the dishes, just reuse your own plate.", "NTA. Going forward, she gets a paper plate.", "NTA\n\nYour house isn\u2019t a Chinese buffer where you have to get a clean plate after you\u2019re done with your first.", "INFO Were you eating a meal at home or at a buffet?", "NTA", "What I\u2019ve never heard of that? Also go get your own seconds? NTA", "NTA. This is a new one for me. I have NEVER heard of giving someone a completely new plate for second helpings.", "NTA.  But it does sort of depend on your family tradition.  I know families that get a clean plate each time.  If she is from that sort of tradition, than yeah, she would be kinda of jerk.  If she's not then the sis is out of line bigtime.", "Did you grow up in the same household? This to me seems like something that would be \"a thing my family does\" or \"a thing my sister always has done\". It's a weird practice to me, but weirder that it's seemingly out of the blue. Assuming that this isn't something that she's always done/expected that you should have known about NTA.", "NTA\nWhat you did is how normal people eat when getting seconds. I've never dirties a second plate for getting seconds, unless it's like hours later.", "Is this a buffet? Cause that's the only time I know of that people need a new plate. Your sister is neurotic.", "NTA, your family is weird. Nice of you to serve her a second helping tho!", "Nah.  Some people like their seconds on a clean plate.", "The reason it\u2019s against health code in the US to allow buffet patrons to refill plates using their used plates is that your germs are on the plate which could contaminate the food via the serving utensils that touch the plate.  It\u2019s to protect the food left in the pot and other patrons, not to protect the person with the used plate.  Small YTA for not using a clean plate but not for the same reason. \nOur family eats family style and allows seconds on the same plate; but no one complains.", "Yea she\u2019s a woman so you are not the bad guy she is just a kid", "Unless you're at a buffet. But even that rule has always seemed a little odd to me. As long as the serving dishes aren't touching the plate... what's the big deal?", "Only time I would get a new plate is at a buffet or if it was a paper plate that got too flimsy to hold up my mashed potatoes and gravy", "In my country people ate their food (mostly potato mashed with veggies and also meat to the side) and then their dessert (mostly some sort of custard or yoghurt) was put on the same plate. They did this so they had less dishes and therefore used less water. We don\u2019t really do this anymore but it was done for generations long.", "Okay so this was me as a child. I would refuse to eat seconds on a plate I already used with the same food. Even a bowl of cereal, chips, anything. Well I had undiagnosed OCD lol.", "& do the washing up.", "If you want a clean plate for your 2nd helping, go to Mandarin.  Otherwise, in this household, you're using the same plate for your 2nd or 3rd plate of food.", "Yeah for a second helping of the same food? That you just ate 2 minutes ago? That\u2019s absolutely stupid.", "Your my favorite of the day, funny comment.", "And she can do all the dishes!", "The other day I made my mom a plate chili cheese tots, but peraonally wasnt quite ready to eat yet.  I ended up just using her plate later because fuck extra dishes. Its not like she licked it.", "And do the dishes", "Exactly. It sounds like the sister heard a bit about it being rude/unhygienic to take used plates back to the buffet and ran with it. \n\nHer stance lacks any kind of logic. It's her plate. She was the only one eating off of it. If she considers her own plate nasty, then why ask someone else to touch it.  She can get her own food.", "How nasty is she she doesn't want to eat off her own plate?", "Really. If you had 8 guests and an 8 place setting, what are you supposed to do? Get some of these cheap paper plates and give her one of those next time.", "To be fair they weren't eating 'family style'. OP went to get a second plate of food for someone, that's the opposite of 'family style'. They were in a traditional host-guest style of eating.\n\nDoesn't really matter for this one though, it's not rude to use the same plate when giving someone seconds.", "Ngl\u2026. If I\u2019m eating something like a piece of toast I might reuse the same plate from breakfast for lunch \ud83d\ude05", "My brother does this every family gathering because of my aunty but he only gives her the paper plate and plastic knife, fork, spoon. He even makes it looks fancy with napkins somehow.. she's an asshole though. She use  to leave a million dishes after eating at his house. You can see the steam coming out every time \ud83e\udd23", "I second the paper plate idea. Also for your father. Get really obnoxious ones.", "New toothbrush.... really if I thought about it", "OP needs to complain about the used toilet seat and TP roll next time they visit this crummy sister.", "This! I kept struggling to understand why the sister wasn\u2019t getting her own 2nd helping?! It\u2019s family, not some new guest\u2026get your own damn food princess.", "Tell her she has to wash her plate *before* putting her seconds on it.", "Really they do it so your plate won\u2019t contaminate the buffet. \n\nThe other way round isn\u2019t a thing and sis makes no sense.", "I hope those folks are the ones doing the dishes.", "Where did OP say they were at a buffet?", "> She is a woman so you are not the bad guy she is just a kid\n\nWhat kind of horse shit bait is this lol\nFuck off back to the hole the earth shit you out of", "In theory yes, in practice people are gross", "This is 100% about health regulations to avoid cross contamination. It just takes one serving spoon hitting a dirty plate to make a restaurant full of people sick. Or possibly even kill someone with an allergy.", "One time I watched a lady at a buffet take a bite of a sausage roll then put it back on her plate, I guess she just didn't like it. Later I saw that same lady with that same one-bite-missing sausage roll at the buffet line again in front of me. Then I saw a one-bite-missing sausage roll sitting next to all the fresh sausage rolls in the pans.... I still can't eat at buffets unless there's chefs plating the food for you.", "People touch their plate with the serving utensil or spill food at buffets all the time.", "I think the main reason for buffet places not allowing reused plates is to keep the serving areas cleaner.  \n\nNobody wants someone\u2019s plate covered in leftover marinara sauce splashing the food as they carry it around going back for seconds.", "Oh, it's absolutely just a healthy reg.\nBecause you don't know who like, licks their plate even though they have plague, and then scrapes stuff back into the main dish when they have too much.\n\nIf we all take clean plates, there's less liability to the restaurant (and you and I won't get the plague from someone who was actually raised in a barn).", "At buffets I can understand - how else will everyone know you\u2019ve eaten 15 plates of Chinese food?", "The serving implement at a buffet often end up touching the plate. It's definitely safer for everyone to use a clean plate every time food is served from the buffet.\n\nAlso, what happens if I'm gay in Indiana?", "Well the serving spoons and tongs and stuff might touch the used plate when refilling it so I get it.", "The serving spoons will likely touch the plate though", "I just don't want the sauces of what I just tried to mix with what I'm having now.", "But they can't guarantee the serving utensils don't touch the plate. That's why it's a big deal", "The serving utensils touch the plate. A clean plate eliminates contamination.", "At a buffet, it's because when you use the serving UTENSILS to put food unto your dirty plate, that the Utensils might touch the germs on the plate, and they could transfer to the next person's plate", "That's to prevent Cross contamination.", "I remeber going to a buffet for the first time as a kid and I was so confused when told not to bring my old plate with me. Even now I think that creates an unnecessary amount of dishes.", "My worst nightmare", "Are you Dutch?? Because I could NEVER, but I\u2019ve seen it happening (actually only at one household). I always skipped dessert when I was eating at that friends house as a child and I saw they were doing this, because that grossed me out. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if it was really _that_ common, but I certainly hope it was not. But I\u2019m also the person that hates my \u2018wet\u2019 greens touching my crispy potatoes.", "This right here. She can do the dishes, too.", "Or that second piece of pie later in the evening\u2026. \ud83d\ude0b", "Wonderful. Maybe use the steam to clean the dishes! Ha!", "Me too.  We use a dishwasher so one more plate doesn't really ever require a new washload.  We only have one new plate needer in our home.", "Nobody said that OP said that. That\u2019s just where the related rule exists.", "Right. Which is why I get it... but I hate following it myself haha. (I think I have PDA autism and a lot of things are suddenly making a lot more sense)", "True, true. I guess I should have clarified: I personally don't like following that rule (which is kind of assholey of me, I know \ud83d\ude02). I have a lot of eco anxiety and so I always feel bad putting more plates through the wash.", "Yeah, but people lick their fingers and go right back to grab the serving spoons. Really, buffets should have a server at every station to help people plate up.", "Yeah, people are worse-mannered than animals at a buffet.  I have seen kids dig through the sunflower seeds with their filthy hands, sneeze on the food (they were shorter than the sneeze-guard), and adults are not much better. \n\nI used to occasionally go to the buffet as soon as it opened, with the understanding that it would still be an exercise for my immune system. There are no good buffets where I live now, and I am fine with that.", "I know, it's a good general rule. I'm just saying, if the world were full of mes, I know I would be careful, and so we wouldn't need that rule \ud83d\ude02", "Even if you don't do that, you probably do put utensils in your mouth that then touch the plate.", "That stack of plates is a badge of honor!!", "Speaking from experience, you move to DC.  Then freak out the cops visiting from Indiana because you went onto the metro with a cardboard standee of Commander Data from Star Trek, who was wearing a feather boa.\n\nPretty sure my experience is universal.", "That's how it was for me growing up in the US haha. It seems so normal that I didn't know it bothered people.", "Haha!", "Then if they weren't at a buffet, how could OP possibly be the asshole here?  They were in a home, *OP*'s home, seconds go on the same plate.  I understand wanting a clean plate for desert so it doesn't taste like your dinner, but there's nothing wrong with serving the same food onto the same plate for the same person twice, that's standard.  OP, NTA.  Your sister is just being difficult, be sure to insist on a new plate/silverware next time you're there.  Then go to the bathroom and complain there wasn't a fresh new roll of TP for you to use.", "NAT. I'm trying to find the logic in her thinking but all I can see is the tumbleweed that clearly occupies her brain.", "Think about it this way: if you accidentally cross contaminated a dish and got a whole restaurant sick (not saying you would but a what if scenario), there would be more water wasted from sick people constantly having to flush their toilets than there would've been from an extra dish going through an efficient restaurant grade dishwasher", "I get that and I\u2019m totally the same way. If it makes you feel any better though a big buffet likely has a pretty efficient dishwasher that wouldn\u2019t be as wasteful per dish as washing by hand. It\u2019s worth the extra water to protect people\u2019s health", "That\u2019s really gross!  Do you want to taste lemons in your beef&broccoli because some other asshat brought their used plate with leftover lemon sauce on it?\n\nAs others said, industrial restaurant dishwashers are very efficient in water needed per plate so it is just less disgusting to use a fresh plate.", "Well the very nature of buffets are inherently super wasteful at least the dishes need to be clean. Also a buffet usually use a conveyor belt dishwasher so it keeps going at all times anyways.", "Haha maybe it doesn\u2019t bother most people? For me personally I would hate some leftover gravy or broccoli in my pudding. \n\nIn OP\u2019s situation I wouldn\u2019t mind though, totally normal to go for a second serving on the same plate.", "I agree with you, Y T A is an incorrect judgement. That doesn\u2019t mean Entertainer claimed they were at a buffet.", "\ud83e\uddfb\ud83e\udea0 \ud83d\udebd and the trees for the TP lol", "Maybe I'm an asshole here but I feel like if your allergy is so bad it can kill you if it touches another plate then maybe don't go to a buffet and even risk it?"]}
