We have twins, both 17(F,M). My wife and I are the stereotype of high school sweethearts. I'm more of a geek. She was a cheer leader. My son takes after my wife and my daughter take after me.\n\nWhen they were younger, I gave them the option of allowance. They could either spend the money on what they wanted to or I could walk them through investments and savings. My wife was all for this at that time. We explained that they each have a set amount of money that we have put away for future schooling as well as a car fund. At first, both of my kids decided to invest it, and I started to show them how to and the risk involved. My son put his in to a very risky investment(against my advice) and ended up losing it and decided not to do it anymore(with in a few weeks).\n\nMy daughter started off rough but quickly got the hang of it. Playing with different investments and companies. She has been in the positive most weeks.\n\nThe issue is that due to this, my daughter has saved up more money than her brother.\u00a0 She also likes to spend most of her time over at my house vs my son over at my ex-wife's house \n\nMy daughter's interests are more minimalistic when it comes to most things and does not spend a lot of money. She will when she finds things she likes. She is not into fashion, rarely puts on makeup (when she does, it is very light), bought a used but nice car, etc. They just got their acceptance letters for college, and she will be able to pic any of her choices due to grades and her savings plus our contributions.\n\nMy son, on the other hand, spends most of his money when he gets it. Always has new clothes constantly (bunch of shoes), bought a new, very expensive car with payments, goes out all the time, and spends everything he gets. My son is upset because he can't go to the collage he wants because he would need to get a loan, and with what I make, he doesn't qualify for much.\n\nMy ex says I need to stop favoring my daughter and financially hurting my son and just paying for his college. Among other things. Her and her side of the family are all calling me an AH for not paying \"because you easily could.\"\n\nI told them that they had a choice when he was younger and he didn't listen. I also pointed out the fact that if he had saved his money, he would have also been able to go where he wanted. He needed to get a job to cover costs if he wanted to go. And life was about choices.\n\n\nTLDR: My daughter is more like me (a geek). My son is like my ex-wife (popular and materialistic). Gave them an allowance and the opportunity to invest and save. Only my daughter did, and now my son and family are mad that I'm not giving him more money and favoring my daughter.\u00a0\n\nEarly ETA: I did keep asking him to try again throughout the years. But he didn't care. I gave up almost two years ago when he said he wanted to live almost full time at his moms house. We had an argument that made me back off. I didn't just stop and drop it when he was really young.", "created_utc": 1680034348, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1250pyx/aita_for_showing_favoritism_for_my_daughter_and/", "score": 635, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's great that your daughter was smart with her funds, but it's very reasonable to expect that a lot of kids would, like your son, risk and lose money in that situation.

If so, she\u2019s an AH.", "NTA\nYou were transparent about everything, including having set funds you were willing to spend on their school.

While the son may not have gotten \"it\" about investing, that doesn't mean he couldn't have been saving his money instead of spending everything thing he got like there was no tomorrow. That was his choice, and now the time has come to pay the piper. If mom, whom he has been living with for the past several years, wants to finance him, and pay for the college he wants to go to, she can.", "I mean, you did treat your children equally. And you have no obligation to pay for their school. But I also don't think that children should be responsible for making financial decisions that impact their future at like ten years old, that seems like an obvious set-up. I'm sure he didn't understand the consequences of his choices at that age, so it seems like a shame to make his future suffer for that now. Not that he deserves more money or anything, but your plan to have the kids fundraise their own college without telling them kinda sucked. There's a reason kids aren't supposed to be responsible for that kinda thing, and this is it.

Meanwhile, sister has been saving and can afford her first choice.    \nThere is nothing wrong with son attending a community college, getting a job, and saving a bit. \n\nIf dad funds first choice of college fully, it would not surprise me if there isn\u2019t a new post from dad asking if he is the AH for not paying more once son blows through a years expenses and doesn\u2019t pass classes.", "Have you *given* the same amount to each child?\n\nContinue to give each the same amount, and give your son another financial literacy course now that he's older.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Also you will be favouring your son by giving him more - I thought your ex was against favouring a child?", "NTA. Parents are not required to pay for a college education.  Is it nice to do? Absolutely. My take is college is mostly a scam, with the exception of a high earning professions such as doctor,  lawyer,  or STEM. Beyond that, I don't think that amount of money/debt is worth it in the end, especially with the predatory loans given to an 18 year old. I saw a comment saying you have the ability to pay for it. Would you be willing to pay and sign a notarized letter stating over the course of say, 10-12 years, pay it back to you with zero interest? That way, he wouldn't owe more on a loan than he originally took out?", "NTA. If your ex literally said you\u2019re favoring your daughter, when she had the same choices as the son, and financially hurting your son, who\u2026again\u2026had the same choices, then we see who\u2019s really got a favorite here.

You have treated both equally, and given both the same things. Your daughter acted responsibly your son did not. There are consequences to our actions, this is the lesson - even if it isn't an easy one to learn.\n\nThat said, if your son comes to you with a plan on what he wants to do (re:college) or asks for your help with that, you should do whatever you can to support him and help him get there. You are walking a fine line in the lesson you are teaching, but if he is learning it and taking proactive steps towards being responsible then giving him a hand up is part of your duty as a father.", " I think NAH.  You tried to reach your children an important skill, one child learned the lessons, one didn\u2019t.  If your son had saved his money he\u2019d be in a better situation.  As it is, he can still go to college, he\u2019s just not in as good a position as his sister is.

Right now you have a choice of helping your kid get a start on his adult life and you're using it to make some sort of ideological point instead of helping him. \n\nYes we can say that the actual child should have made better financial choices.. But right now you're going for the win. The kid like you is the winner while the one like your ex gets to work.\n\nIt is 2023, how much does he need to work to pay for school? And thanks to your income he can't even get financial aid. \n\nMake it up to your daughter, but help your son succeed in life by helping him with college. It seems like you can afford it, you just want to be right instead.", "nta. Your intentions were good. your son is going to struggle through life.  i started my kids investing  at an early age like you did.  They both are doing well. We also contributed to both their educations.. They went different routes. However, they both received the same financial support. I would pony up the monies for your son's education if you can afford it, but make sure your daughter revieves the same into her bank account. No one can call favoritism ..", "How the fuck am I reading so much N T A? \n\nDo some math. He gave up convincing his son 2 years ago, at age 15, after trying \u201ethroughout the years\u201c. Meaning he did this when they were 10-13 years old? \n\nHe tried to make 13 years old into investment banker, let his son sink money, and expected them to have knowledge about the longterm financial consequences.

YTA for the TLDR for sure though.", "YTA.  You set him up to fail.  You were a crappy parent allowing a child to make adult decisions with no safety net.  You designed a system to reward the kid who was like you and give just desserts to the one like your wife, instead of trying to instill good values in them both.  You have been actively hurting your son for years.  If they are making bad decisions that require adult approval like car loans and investments, then you are making bad decisions.  If he is spending money unwisely, stop giving him free money instead of holding it over him later.\n\nIt's a shame you can't just divorce your son.  It looks like you found the next best way to permanently hurt him.", "NTA. You are not favoring your daughter. Both kids had the same opportunity. She saved hers, he squandered his. That leads to natural consequences. There is no favoritism here (except your ex to your son).", "INFO: how was your son able to obtain a car loan before the age of 18?", "NTA.\n\nBut pay for both kids colleges, or the same amount of contribution. For example they each get $20k a year or something. Whatever you can afford. \n\nLet you daughter keep her money to spend how she wants. Big trip, house in the future, new car, nicer apartment in college, more fun money in college, wedding the future etc. \n\nBut do not keep funding your sons life in to adulthood because he keeps spending all of his money.", "YTA. Education is important. If you saw your child struggle to make the right choices/investments you should\u2019ve helped or just taken over or created a fund for their college. It does sound like you\u2019re favoring your daughter because she is more like you so try to reach an understanding with your son\u2026. For example, say you\u2019ll pay his college if he gets some sort of part time job. Or as someone else suggested, you\u2019ll pay for his college but also give your daughter some bonus, for example to help get a master\u2019s degree or help with a down payment of a house. And try to talk to your son again about making better financial choices.", "NTA\n\nHe has a college fund for both kids. He is not making them fund their education from their allowance. Daughter is just ABLE to fund her education with her allowance because she saved and brother didn't.\n\nSo let's say that they each have $X in their college fund.\n\nDaughter has $X from college fund plus $Y that she has been diligently saving for years.\n\nSon only has $X because rather than saving, he blew every penny he made as soon as it hit his wallet.\n\nWhat lesson is dad teaching both of his kids by making up for son's lack of discipline?\n\nHe's teaching son that daddy will bail out his crappy choices. He's teaching daughter that her hard work is actually penalizing her because she is ultimately receiving less money from him even though she was the one that acted responsibly.\n\nHis son can still go to college - his life's career success is not hinging on his teenage financial decisions. But having to take out loans or go to a cheaper school is a perfectly reasonable and natural consequence of his actions that is going to go a lot further towards teaching him financial responsibility.\n\nUnless he is willing (and able) to make up for son's financial situation and give the same amount to daughter so she doesn't have to dip into her savings, then he is NOT showing favoritism and he is NTA.", "NTA whatsoever. He could have chosen any time to learn. Also, why is it that you have to just because you could financially? That\u2019s just rude. \n\nQuestion: you said she wanted you to pay for college \u201camong other things\u201d. What were the other things? \n\nMaybe see about talking to him about his job prospects and ask if he would like to learn again about how to invest and save. Have him learn with some of the money from paychecks here and there. He\u2019s still young enough that he can kick this habit and learn something good. If they have issues with THAT, then you know what they want and they will never be happy unless you cough up money so they don\u2019t have to.\n\nETA: Also, his wife agreed to this. It wasn\u2019t until after their daughter was doing well and their son wasn\u2019t that she wanted him to change his mind. He treated them both quite equally.

That way your son can get his college paid for, and your daughter isn't punished for making the right choices.", "NTA. You did well as a father. It will be a mistake to reward your son now for his behaviour.", "NTA. Son keeps choosing to spend lavishly. That has consequences. Daughter lives more frugally and so has more money for college.

Fair is fair.", "NTA - wouldn\u2018t it be favouritism to give him more and your daughter not?", "NTA\n\nYou gave them equal opportunities.

It\u2019s a brilliant lesson in finances, hopefully he and your ex wife learn something.", "Sounds like the two of you just click on the same level.

YTA.", "Let's start with the fact that my father is a stockbroker and I grew up hearing a lot about the market. I still enjoy a lot about it as an adult so I know where you're coming from but YTA. Big time. You let a child determine if they would have enough money to go to college. Kids are stupid. That's why they have parents that are supposed to watch over them. You used the fact that you like your daughter more to punish your son. You should've taught him how to save and been a good role model rather than punish him for being like your ex. Fail as parent and when he gets older he's going to realize how little you actually like him.", "Nta. He can go to a college that's within his college fund budget or get loans.", "NTA", "NTA. From what you've said, you were very open and honest with your kids about their options from a young age. I think it's a better lesson for your son to learn now rather than later that he can't just spend money however he wants and not have consequences. He can still go to college; he'll just have to take out loans and maybe go to a cheaper school. It's not ideal, but if he works hard and chooses a profession that pays enough, he'll be fine.", "YTA that wasn\u2019t an age appropriate choice to hand over. He couldn\u2019t possibly have understood that he was risking his college education and even if he did, lacked the maturity to understand that it was a bad choice.

You did your best to try to teach both children about finances and one understood and 1 did not. I think that's really great but now that they're going into college I don't think that you should hold that against them. If you had tried to teach me something like that at a young age I would not have caught on, and that is no lie. Am I better as an adult? Heck yeah. I think you had too high of expectations for such young kids and it just so happens that 1 exceeded your expectations while the other did not. Do you really want to hold this against their future? As a parent, really what should be happening is working out a plan. Don't withhold money just because your son didn't learn the same thing as your daughter. If you have the money and college is affordable and hes taking courses that will benefit his future, you should definitely help out your son.\n\nNothing is ever fair but I surely don't think your daughter would resent you for helping out your son to go to college. Do you?", "NTA \n\nI do think its unfair that your daughter would have to use her savings for college and your son expects to just be given the money.

We have twins, both 17(F,M). My wife and I are the stereotype of high school sweethearts. I'm more of a geek. She was a cheer leader. My son takes after my wife and my daughter take after me.\n\nWhen they were younger, I gave them the option of allowance. They could either spend the money on what they wanted to or I could walk them through investments and savings. My wife was all for this at that time. We explained that they each have a set amount of money that we have put away for future schooling as well as a car fund. At first, both of my kids decided to invest it, and I started to show them how to and the risk involved. My son put his in to a very risky investment(against my advice) and ended up losing it and decided not to do it anymore(with in a few weeks).\n\nMy daughter started off rough but quickly got the hang of it. Playing with different investments and companies. She has been in the positive most weeks.\n\nThe issue is that due to this, my daughter has saved up more money than her brother.\u00a0 She also likes to spend most of her time over at my house vs my son over at my ex-wife's house \n\nMy daughter's interests are more minimalistic when it comes to most things and does not spend a lot of money. She will when she finds things she likes. She is not into fashion, rarely puts on makeup (when she does, it is very light), bought a used but nice car, etc. They just got their acceptance letters for college, and she will be able to pic any of her choices due to grades and her savings plus our contributions.\n\nMy son, on the other hand, spends most of his money when he gets it. Always has new clothes constantly (bunch of shoes), bought a new, very expensive car with payments, goes out all the time, and spends everything he gets. My son is upset because he can't go to the collage he wants because he would need to get a loan, and with what I make, he doesn't qualify for much.\n\nMy ex says I need to stop favoring my daughter and financially hurting my son and just paying for his college. Among other things. Her and her side of the family are all calling me an AH for not paying \"because you easily could.\"\n\nI told them that they had a choice when he was younger and he didn't listen. I also pointed out the fact that if he had saved his money, he would have also been able to go where he wanted. He needed to get a job to cover costs if he wanted to go. And life was about choices.\n\n\nTLDR: My daughter is more like me (a geek). My son is like my ex-wife (popular and materialistic). Gave them an allowance and the opportunity to invest and save. Only my daughter did, and now my son and family are mad that I'm not giving him more money and favoring my daughter.\u00a0\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Simple solution: pay for both kids (or whatever you can where both kids get equitable amounts).

I\u2019m glad your daughter is doing great and she\u2019s smart.

If I knew my kid couldn't responsibly handle investing, and I was using it as an allowance scheme for college, half of their spending money would have been put into an account they couldn't touch until they were older and more responsible with their funds. \n\nYour daughter is developmentally advanced for being able to understand investing and taking appropriate level risks from an early age - your son, in all honesty, making stupid impulsive high risk choices and then being risk averse after experiencing the consequences is closer to what is developmentally normal for most young teens. Add in the whole twin thing and finding an identity of personal personhood and not just being so-and-sos twin, and you got a recipe for kids making choices against themselves for the sake of being different. While well-intentioned, you definitely fucked this up by not understanding children in general and set your kids up to fail, you lucked out that your daugther was able to grasp it well enough, early enough to get ahead.\n\nIf you can afford it, you should pay for half of your son's college, and you should put aside half of what you pay towards the son's college for a starter fund for your daughter or consider paying half of her college as well, so she can save the other half of her investments and let them continue to grow for when she's ready to enter the workforce.

All you have to do is make sure you have a good mix of safe investments and risky ones, with the risky ones not being too risky that you lose everything. I can help you along the way if you have any questions, and if you want to stop then you can put some of your allowance into the fund I've set up at the bank.\" When you make your children's decisions completely responsible for their entire futures without offering some sort of safety net, you're setting them up for failure.

Student loans do not teach lessons. They merely take. If you want to reward your daughter for investing, pay for both of their colleges if you can afford it and she gets to keep the money she made.

Once they are done school you don't need to give them any money ever again if you don't want.\n\nRegards, you should just pay for both to go to school (assuming you can actually afford this).

He didn\u2019t save the money you gave him, and you informed him of the consequences of that action. You gave equally to both children.

This spurred my dad opening up mutual funds for both of us, and we could invest however much of our $ in there. \n\nWell, I was constantly spending everything on shopping sprees and new gadgets. I wanted everything that everyone else had. I put away small amounts but my brother truly saved as much as possible. My parents constantly reminded me of the gap that was increasing between my bank balance and my brothers but I didn\u2019t care.\n\nFor college, my parents gave us the same lump sum. If we used it all on college, great. If we got scholarships and didn\u2019t use all of it, the rest was ours to keep. I know this is already super generous and I used all of it to go to my dream school. \n\nFast forward to now, and my brother has enough to buy a house in his early twenties, continues to invest, and lives frugally. I myself don\u2019t have a ton saved up, I make more but spend more, and can\u2019t afford a house for years to come. But, those are consequences of our actions and our priorities. That\u2019s literally how the world works: the things you do today will impact the things you can do tomorrow. \n\nI think you did what you could to teach fiscal responsibility when most other parents don\u2019t, and you\u2019ve very much taught a valuable lesson on the time value of money. \n\nNow onto the other issue of being pressured to pay for your son\u2019s college: college does somewhat determine the opportunities you have straight out of college. If you have the means but are withholding it, I do think you might see a strain in your relationship in the long run. If you want to be supportive while also teaching a lesson, a few ideas: \n\n1. Give your son a loan. He has to work to pay it back, maybe you lower the payback amount if he maintains his grades. It\u2019s not a free handout, he still gets the other college fund, and he isn\u2019t held back for opportunities later on. \n\n2. Give your kids a little more each as an 18th birthday present. What they want to do with it is up to them, whether they want to use it towards school or savings or whatever. \n\nGood luck OP. Seems to be a lot of entitlement here on how you spend your money haha", "NTA too many parents want to give their kids everything without teaching them to value anything. You tried to teach your kids how to invest and save and told them honestly what that was for. I wish I had that kind of education and encouragement at that age.

The only thing is that investments usually \"generate\" money and so for people to win, doesn't necessitate others losing.

Yeah it's likely they'd have fights, but they could always have dad or mom be a deciding vote if they couldn't agree say after 30 mins of discussion or analysis. \n\nPersonally I would have loved to be taught about investment and how to actually buy shares etc. I honestly don't know what the right thing to do for him is now, because if he spends more of his own money on son's education he's playing favourites the other way, but if he doesn't, he takes partial blame for not giving his son the same chance to go to college, and that will likely be life-changing for the son.

Why does their mother think this is fair or favoritism ?", "He made them make long-term financial decisions at age 13-14. Are you fucking delusional?", "The kid is 17 now, and this happened \"when they were younger.\"\n\nNo kid should be given the power to torpedo their college prospects at an early age.

Or alternately, offer him an interest-free loan (and deduct it from his inheritance or other monetary gifts if he doesn\u2019t repay it). There are ways to be fair but also to support his son. Personally, I think it\u2019s very unwise to let a 13 year old have access to their college fund. Not unfair but unwise.", "This does not sound like \u201clittle allowance\u201d though..", "Some kids don't even get an allowance or help with college wtf", "Sounds like fucking entitlement to me. That\u2019s never truly helped anyone in life. Kid pissed his college savings away because his mother let him spend recklessly, why is she not paying for it? Dad already put his money in and the daughter did the responsible thing, how is that the dads fault?", "But both kids have a separate college fund. OP is giving them X amount towards their education. Where daughter wants to go costs X plus Y. She has Y (what she saved/earned through investing) and is going to put it towards college. She could have put it towards grad school, gone on a cruise, or bought a shiny rock. \n\nSon wants to go to a school that costs X plus Y. But he doesn\u2019t have Y.

That would keep things equal and fair to your daughter, and it could make a BIG difference in your son's life. Student debt can be crippling to a young adult and impact his life for decades - so if you can help avoid that, as a loving father you should. \n\nIt doesn't have to be enough money for him to graduate debt free - his choices still have consequences and your money isn't infinite after all.

Anyone could have seen this coming.", "Ohhh so this is like a revenge thing to get back at him", "I'm sorry, but this is still your child. Even if he hates you, if you can afford to pay for his college you absolutely should do so...especially since your income will prevent him from getting a decent loan. Frankly, you're screwing him over big time.

OPs money is better spent in savings for retirement or a rainy day over paying money just so son can attend the school he PREFERS. \n\nBoth OPs children are able to go to college and set themselves up for their future. The lifetime earning difference of a state school student vs a private college student is negligible. It would only make a difference if the son got into an Ivy League school. And if he doesn\u2019t have the scholarships or grants to attend without asking for more money, he clearly doesn\u2019t have the grades or test schools for an Ivy League to make a difference in the long run.", "Ah, that would be confusing. I was being a bit sarcastic in my first comment. While I don't have a ton of experience with student loan's because my parents weren't vindictive like OP, I do understand enough about the current student loan crisis to know that both Ithinkibrokethis and OP are setting this kid up for additional hardships.", "Because if you're going to hold a kid to the expectation of saving up well and fully then I am going to hold OP to the same standard. Clearly he failed at saving up adequately for the level of intelligence his kids showed. Instead of being happy his kids succeeded and got into good schools he's holding his child's 'lack of planning' against him. And OP's story and edits make it seem like the main reason he is holding it against the kid is because the kid took after the ex-wife.", "Maybe the son is shortsighted as he\u2019s 17, but what is he expecting in the long run? He\u2019s going to live off his allowance? Why isn\u2019t he looking to go to community college instead? He\u2019s 17, not 4. He\u2019s old enough for some ideas. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me having a daughter like OPs daughter, but she\u2019s thinking 10 steps ahead of the son since she\u2019s been in high school. \n\nThe thing I also seeing as problematic is that his mom isn\u2019t helping the situation. She agreed with the decision when they are a kid and now she\u2019s backing out of the deal because it\u2019s better for her. The entitlement is there and I feel like if the son showed any want whatsoever that OP would be inclined to revisit it."]}
