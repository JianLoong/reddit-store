We have twins, both 17(F,M). My wife and I are the stereotype of high school sweethearts. I'm more of a geek. She was a cheer leader. My son takes after my wife and my daughter take after me.\n\nWhen they were younger, I gave them the option of allowance. They could either spend the money on what they wanted to or I could walk them through investments and savings. My wife was all for this at that time. We explained that they each have a set amount of money that we have put away for future schooling as well as a car fund. At first, both of my kids decided to invest it, and I started to show them how to and the risk involved. My son put his in to a very risky investment(against my advice) and ended up losing it and decided not to do it anymore(with in a few weeks).\n\nMy daughter started off rough but quickly got the hang of it. Playing with different investments and companies. She has been in the positive most weeks.\n\nThe issue is that due to this, my daughter has saved up more money than her brother.\u00a0 She also likes to spend most of her time over at my house vs my son over at my ex-wife's house \n\nMy daughter's interests are more minimalistic when it comes to most things and does not spend a lot of money. She will when she finds things she likes. She is not into fashion, rarely puts on makeup (when she does, it is very light), bought a used but nice car, etc. They just got their acceptance letters for college, and she will be able to pic any of her choices due to grades and her savings plus our contributions.\n\nMy son, on the other hand, spends most of his money when he gets it. Always has new clothes constantly (bunch of shoes), bought a new, very expensive car with payments, goes out all the time, and spends everything he gets. My son is upset because he can't go to the collage he wants because he would need to get a loan, and with what I make, he doesn't qualify for much.\n\nMy ex says I need to stop favoring my daughter and financially hurting my son and just paying for his college. Among other things. Her and her side of the family are all calling me an AH for not paying \"because you easily could.\"\n\nI told them that they had a choice when he was younger and he didn't listen. I also pointed out the fact that if he had saved his money, he would have also been able to go where he wanted. He needed to get a job to cover costs if he wanted to go. And life was about choices.\n\n\nTLDR: My daughter is more like me (a geek). My son is like my ex-wife (popular and materialistic). Gave them an allowance and the opportunity to invest and save. Only my daughter did, and now my son and family are mad that I'm not giving him more money and favoring my daughter.\u00a0\n\nEarly ETA: I did keep asking him to try again throughout the years. But he didn't care. I gave up almost two years ago when he said he wanted to live almost full time at his moms house. We had an argument that made me back off. I didn't just stop and drop it when he was really young.\n\nEDIT 2: We did not give him his college fun. He has enough money in his college fund that he van attend a Community college for 4 years or a good college for 2. Nothing fancy or big. \n\nThe monet that was invested was allowance. Or spare money. My daughter would use b day money, Christmas money, allowance, or any extra chore money.\n\nIm not bragging, but I could send them to the best colleges for as many years as they want. And fund their life's comfortably.", "created_utc": 1680034348, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1250pyx/aita_for_showing_favoritism_for_my_daughter_and/", "score": 4455, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's great that your daughter was smart with her funds, but it's very reasonable to expect that a lot of kids would, like your son, risk and lose money in that situation.

Absolutely. My take is college is mostly a scam, with the exception of a high earning professions such as doctor,  lawyer,  or STEM. Beyond that, I don't think that amount of money/debt is worth it in the end, especially with the predatory loans given to an 18 year old. I saw a comment saying you have the ability to pay for it.

You are walking a fine line in the lesson you are teaching, but if he is learning it and taking proactive steps towards being responsible then giving him a hand up is part of your duty as a father.", " I think NAH.

You designed a system to reward the kid who was like you and give just desserts to the one like your wife, instead of trying to instill good values in them both.  You have been actively hurting your son for years.  If they are making bad decisions that require adult approval like car loans and investments, then you are making bad decisions.

If you had tried to teach me something like that at a young age I would not have caught on, and that is no lie. Am I better as an adult? Heck yeah. I think you had too high of expectations for such young kids and it just so happens that 1 exceeded your expectations while the other did not. Do you really want to hold this against their future? As a parent, really what should be happening is working out a plan. Don't withhold money just because your son didn't learn the same thing as your daughter.

We have twins, both 17(F,M). My wife and I are the stereotype of high school sweethearts. I'm more of a geek. She was a cheer leader. My son takes after my wife and my daughter take after me.\n\nWhen they were younger, I gave them the option of allowance. They could either spend the money on what they wanted to or I could walk them through investments and savings. My wife was all for this at that time. We explained that they each have a set amount of money that we have put away for future schooling as well as a car fund. At first, both of my kids decided to invest it, and I started to show them how to and the risk involved. My son put his in to a very risky investment(against my advice) and ended up losing it and decided not to do it anymore(with in a few weeks).\n\nMy daughter started off rough but quickly got the hang of it. Playing with different investments and companies. She has been in the positive most weeks.\n\nThe issue is that due to this, my daughter has saved up more money than her brother.\u00a0 She also likes to spend most of her time over at my house vs my son over at my ex-wife's house \n\nMy daughter's interests are more minimalistic when it comes to most things and does not spend a lot of money. She will when she finds things she likes. She is not into fashion, rarely puts on makeup (when she does, it is very light), bought a used but nice car, etc. They just got their acceptance letters for college, and she will be able to pic any of her choices due to grades and her savings plus our contributions.\n\nMy son, on the other hand, spends most of his money when he gets it. Always has new clothes constantly (bunch of shoes), bought a new, very expensive car with payments, goes out all the time, and spends everything he gets. My son is upset because he can't go to the collage he wants because he would need to get a loan, and with what I make, he doesn't qualify for much.\n\nMy ex says I need to stop favoring my daughter and financially hurting my son and just paying for his college. Among other things. Her and her side of the family are all calling me an AH for not paying \"because you easily could.\"\n\nI told them that they had a choice when he was younger and he didn't listen. I also pointed out the fact that if he had saved his money, he would have also been able to go where he wanted. He needed to get a job to cover costs if he wanted to go. And life was about choices.\n\n\nTLDR: My daughter is more like me (a geek). My son is like my ex-wife (popular and materialistic). Gave them an allowance and the opportunity to invest and save. Only my daughter did, and now my son and family are mad that I'm not giving him more money and favoring my daughter.\u00a0\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Simple solution: pay for both kids (or whatever you can where both kids get equitable amounts).

I can help you along the way if you have any questions, and if you want to stop then you can put some of your allowance into the fund I've set up at the bank.\" When you make your children's decisions completely responsible for their entire futures without offering some sort of safety net, you're setting them up for failure.

This spurred my dad opening up mutual funds for both of us, and we could invest however much of our $ in there. \n\nWell, I was constantly spending everything on shopping sprees and new gadgets. I wanted everything that everyone else had. I put away small amounts but my brother truly saved as much as possible. My parents constantly reminded me of the gap that was increasing between my bank balance and my brothers but I didn\u2019t care.\n\nFor college, my parents gave us the same lump sum. If we used it all on college, great. If we got scholarships and didn\u2019t use all of it, the rest was ours to keep. I know this is already super generous and I used all of it to go to my dream school. \n\nFast forward to now, and my brother has enough to buy a house in his early twenties, continues to invest, and lives frugally. I myself don\u2019t have a ton saved up, I make more but spend more, and can\u2019t afford a house for years to come. But, those are consequences of our actions and our priorities. That\u2019s literally how the world works: the things you do today will impact the things you can do tomorrow. \n\nI think you did what you could to teach fiscal responsibility when most other parents don\u2019t, and you\u2019ve very much taught a valuable lesson on the time value of money. \n\nNow onto the other issue of being pressured to pay for your son\u2019s college: college does somewhat determine the opportunities you have straight out of college. If you have the means but are withholding it, I do think you might see a strain in your relationship in the long run. If you want to be supportive while also teaching a lesson, a few ideas: \n\n1. Give your son a loan. He has to work to pay it back, maybe you lower the payback amount if he maintains his grades. It\u2019s not a free handout, he still gets the other college fund, and he isn\u2019t held back for opportunities later on. \n\n2. Give your kids a little more each as an 18th birthday present. What they want to do with it is up to them, whether they want to use it towards school or savings or whatever. \n\nGood luck OP. Seems to be a lot of entitlement here on how you spend your money haha", "NTA too many parents want to give their kids everything without teaching them to value anything.

The only thing is that investments usually \"generate\" money and so for people to win, doesn't necessitate others losing.

Where I do think OP went wrong is when he gave money that he considers part of his children\u2019s college funds to them, in easily spendable amounts, over many years, with the expectation that they either make the wise and responsible choice or have future options in life. You don\u2019t give your kid responsibility over something that significant when they\u2019re too immature to be trusted to make the right decision. That\u2019s like giving someone irresponsible financial guardianship over your child. \n\nOP shouldn\u2019t nullify his daughter\u2019s hard work and delayed gratification by giving his son an equal amount of money to her, but given that he\u2019s said he can easily afford for both of them to go to school wherever they want, I think he should pay for it for both of them.

Then when you're older, you make decisions like shopping around for clothes, comparing prices, etc. This is...something else entirely, since it seems clear OP never actually wanted them to treat it as an allowance, but as a college fund to maximize.", "He does sound to have taken this further than most parents. Most give quite small amounts of allowance with the expectation that almost all of it will be regularly spent, with at most 6 months to a year of savings for a larger purchase.\n\nIt sounds like he gave larger amounts (even with investment with only 4 years the principle isn't going to have more than doubled so while the sister is no doubt a bit up she probably doesn't have massively more money than just saving a portion of it would have resulted in), and covered their needs, but left it up to them whether to buy the luxuries or save/invest the rest.\n\nHe definitely seems to have wanted to encourage a saving mindset in his children.\n\nHe then gave them fixed amounts for car and for schooling and the brother seems to have used more money for the car than he was given (and has a car payment as a result) while the sister used less and got a cheaper car but one more in budget, meanwhile the sister is going to use more money for her schooling, while the brother no longer has that option having spent all the other money plus having a car payment.\n\nHe was equitable, but he definitely dropped the ball on the teaching part with his son whose actions were obviously going to put him in a worse financial position than his sister (barring her deciding to spend all her money on like a luxury car or something even more expensive than the one he got).", "But he also could have invested more wisely the next time he got an allowance, he didn\u2019t.  He chose to spend it instead.  He had ample time to turn things around, he chose not to but now wants to say it\u2019s unfair he can\u2019t go to the school he wants.  That\u2019s the natural consequence.", "Yeah right? It's not like the concept of a low fee index fund is particularly hard. Even if he was super risk averse and only went with government bonds that would still mean there's a good chunk of money. More than spending it on shoes and a car.\n\nGranted, I do think the dad should have had some more limits with the whole investing vs do what you want thing. Teenagers aren't exactly rational in all cases. Yes, learning to manage money is important, but we don't let teenagers gamble, smoke, etc for a reason.", "Honestly, since you said you can easily pay tuition, consider doing so for both. Your daughter will still be rewarded for saving by having money for extras, and your son will get the education he needs to succeed.  \n\nBoth kids get the same treatment, your daughter is still rewarded for her hard work and sound thinking and you don\u2019t build a higher wall between you and your son.  \n\nYou did a good thing teaching your kids financial responsibility.  Sometimes they just need a few extra years to really learn it.  Perhaps your son is one who takes a while to get the point?\n\nGood luck", "Your comment makes less than no sense. The allowance had nothing to do with their college fund, which was set aside for them. This is simply about the OP trying to teach his children to be fiscally responsible.\n\nHe gave them equal opportunities, one saved and one wanted the immediate gratification of spending all his allowance on luxury items. The daughter could have chosen to spend her money on literally anything from an apartment to an ATV to a boob lift. Instead she chose to spend it on going to a more expensive college.\n\nCue son to enter from stage left whining about why can his sister go to her choice college but he can't. OP shouldn't have to fork over yet more money to the son simply because his sister chose to spend her savings on a college upgrade. If she hadn't done that, it would have never occurred to the son to complain. He simply perceived unfairness because he not too bright. He still has in his college fund to go to a regular community or tier one college.", "He can use the fund for 4 years of community college, or 2 of a regular college.\n\nAnd he isn't eligible for financial aid because of OP's income.  \n\nOP's daughter had to have made a killing in the stock market for her to upgrade to a normal 4 year college.", "Completely agree. I think OP should contribute equally to their education. The entire reason his son can't get the loan he needs is because of OP's income. Everyone is ignoring that fact because they want to beat down on the kid for not saving his money and/or investing it as a freakin' teenager. The kid wants to get a loan for school. People do it all the time. But OP apparently makes a lot of money, per his comments, and it's preventing his son from getting the loan he needs since college loans assume parents will pay a portion of the college expenses.", "But OP's ex is saying to pay for the son's college while the daughter has to use the money she set aside.

They both got equal college funds and they both got scholarships.", "I'm curious how he got the car loan?  While OP might not step in and stop his son from making pointless materialistic purchases, I seriously doubt he applied for or cosigned for a loan on his son's car.  That almost certainly had to be the mom's doing, so she's actively contributing to his financial mess.", "He could negotiate with Dad (OP)- if I do 2 yr at community college, and show I am dedicated, and save and work in that same time frame, will you subsidize my last 2-3 yr at my choice school?  Cause that woudl probably be a good compromise", "I used the previous posters info tbh. Unsure of when they started.", "The kid invested. He lost money. He said screw this, Why spend money on nothing when I could get useful things from it instead?\n\nThis is a logical conclusion based on the kid's experiences. That's why OP is TA.

You also have a way better chance of acceptance to better schools once you can show you can succeed in a college environment.  I received scholarships as a transfer student and the best schools do need to make up students in Jr/Sr years for those that drop out early on.\n\nSince OP says they can pay for it outright, it makes more sense to consider paying off a loan at the end of it all OR pay for the son's college but in either evet, that cost should expressly be taken out of the sons portion of dad's estate.", "It\u2019s an option.

I walked away with under <10k loans which is fantastic in comparison to my friends. Public university with a 20k scholarship btw and purchased a beater car in high school. My bills were tuition, groceries, and rent (which really killed me.) I guarantee you majority of kids are taking loans, only the richest of the bunch get away with 0 loans.\n\nYour suggestion that him working his way will cover his college costs, without any loans, is quite frankly laughable..\n\nI agree OP shouldnt fund further but it should be made very clear that his son isn't going to just \"pull himself up by the bootstraps\" , he is fucked.", "Oh boy.", "Most of the time those people can take out significant loans though. This is kind of a unique situation where their parents' income is going to prevent them using the route most broke college kids use.  The only way to get around those loan qualifications at this point would be to declare himself an emancipated minor, but to do that he'd need to move out.

I also received a scholarship for transferring in part-time that worked out to cover all of my books, parking pass, and a credit or 2.  Those transferring full-time usually received just under 40% under the transfer scholarship.  Those scholarships were offered to any student transferring with a 3.25 or higher gpa and were often stacked with additional scholarships if you had a 3.75 or higher gpa.

Community college doesn\u2019t usually transfer out of state, or necessarily to private schools. \n\nHi, my mom works in college admissions. This isn't actually correct, at least not in the United States. \n\nAlmost all community colleges in the U.S. are state schools, and are regionally accredited, as opposed to certain, usually scammy, private schools that are nationally accredited. Sometimes people have a fundamental misunderstanding of what regional accreditation vs. national accreditation means. I'm not getting into all that because it's just too much for a single reply, but you want *regional* accreditation - those credits will transfer almost anywhere, including most reputable private schools, even places like MIT, Harvard, Stanford, etc., and you can guarantee that almost every state funded school is regionally accredited. A good friend of mine was valedictorian at a large community college (1700 grads every semester) in our hometown in Florida, and was able to get into Harvard on that alone. \n\nYou are correct that famous, flagship schools, especially private schools, may be fussier about admissions, but if they are regionally accredited, and accept a student who has credits from a regionally accredited community college, those credits will 100% transfer over, and admissions will usually be able to find an equivalent class for any that don't have an exact curriculum match (not always, but again, usually). \n\nWhere credits are unlikely to transfer is national accreditation. The transfer school must be accredited with the same agency, and these are usually specialty agencies; additionally, most nationally accredited schools aren't the most reputable and have national accreditation because they couldn't meet the standards set by regional accrediting agencies.", "It can also affect scholarships. A friend's older brother found that out the hard way. He went to the local community college for 2 years before transferring to a state school, and found out that a lot of their scholarships applied to incoming freshmen only, not transfers. It wasn't just one school either; he applied to several and they were all the same.", "and if he has taken AP classes, probably at least half of those basics are already gone at this point.", "Almost like they are two different people.", "Yeah, and consequences need to be scaled to be age appropriate. A 14 year old should not have been set up to fail by being given a risky investment as an option. Or at the very least could have been taught a very basic idea like diversification. We don't teach kids how to cook by laying out flour, sugar, and poison hoping they make the right choice.", "Not really true. At 17, particularly with males, the nerve connections between the brain and the pre frontal cortex just don't exist. The pre frontal is what we use for reasoning and understanding consequences. Not that he can't do that, all kids can, but the connection between behavior and consequences needs to be really tight (like, I played ball in the house and broke a lamp and I'm grounded, NOT so much I failed to take advantage of the magic of compound interest over the last many years and I can't afford school).\n\nWhat he really needs is more time to literally grow more brain cells, and consequences do not make that happen any faster.\n\nOne could argue that from a brain development perspective, dad is adding stress, which is likely to stunt his growth overall. \n\nIt wouldn't be uncalled for if dad says something like: I gave you a chance to save and you did not.

Yes that makes so much sense. Especially when he can't even get loans because his dad earns too much, even the college is expecting the dad to contribute significantly. An appropriate consequence would be not funding a lavish lifestyle and letting him take a light part time for spending money outside of room and board, hell even loan him the money inatead of giving it ao he at least as the option. YTA OP.", "You mean like the one where he lost money and became scared to invest?", "Maybe, but in this situation, she's got the grades to go to a better school and had proven herself, so letting her keep her savings as her own for emergencies down the line would be really nice for her. It's not like he's just letting her spend thousands on bags and shoes, so I feel it's unlikely to be an unwise investment into her future.", "You're projecting your issues onto this situation.

Clearly, the daughter is one who figured it out, but I don't think that's the expected result. The lesson is a good one but the risk of failure is so high I don't feel great about the method used since the son is like most kids and cannot see the long-term investment. \n\nAdditionally, the son seems to be bankrolled by this allowance he's getting, so why would he ever think that it would end? He's never had consequences for his spending so far and he gets what he wants and now when an actual life altering decision comes around, the consequences kick in. You have to continually teach children that their actions have consequences over and over and over again, but the son hasn't seen any because he was still getting what he wanted. There's no previous experience for this literal teenager to call on in order to understand what's going to happen if he doesn't spend or save wisely. \n\nSure, life isn't fair and he's seeing that now, but if you have the ability, as he so graciously boasted about, to bankroll your kids, then do that. Cover both kids college, but now daughter has a backup savings that will go towards a house or wedding or travel that son won't have. He still gets the education but he will have to step up in order to make the next steps work.

You seem so proud of saying you \u201ctried\u201d a couple times over the course of their lives to teach him how to invest. Yet you still gave him enough to buy an expensive car and those materialistic things you hate so much. Being a parent isn\u2019t picking one child and focusing your efforts. You are a lazy parent. The hard work is getting through to your kids when they don\u2019t want to hear you. That means trying day after day week after week. Reaching out and trying even after he went to live with mom, because he\u2019s still your son. Did you sit him down and explain your whole college funding rules to him? I\u2019ll bet you\u2019re loving the ability to spring this on him. Finally got revenge on those cool kids, huh?", "YTA\n\nAnd i can tell excactly how this whole thing went down.\n\nBoth children got sat down for the allowance talk and then got a brief introduction on how the stock market works.\n\nBoth children follow the advice of their father and start to invest, instead of spending it.\n\nSon then goes around and tries to find out how to invest on his own, while daughter goes to daddy and asks him.\n\nSon later son comes home with the knowledge and confidence of a crypto bro that just heard about the blockchain for the first time and invests his money into basically any big thing that is going on at the time, because that is all that he will find on his own.\n\nDaughter meanwhile gets the JP Morgan gold standard advice from daddy and mostly follows it and only experiments little, because daddy knows best.\n\nSon then gets blasted within weeks on the stock market, because his knowledge is basically worthles and understandably gets frustrated.\n\nSon then stops investing because his allowance is going up in smokes.\n\nAnd i can see how OPs attempts to convince his son to keep on investing went. He probably went the route of \"just do, what your smart sister did and listen to me and then you will have some money as well. Less of course, because you didnt listen to me earlier like your smart sister did, but still more\". Because lord knows that this is the best way to convince a teenager to do the right thing.\n\nPay for your sons college dude, or you will create a rift within your family that will never close.", "I am not from USA and my view on this topic is different from others, because of the culture from my country.\n\nWhere I live parents are responsible for their kids education including university or college.  If you lived in my country and your kid was not smart enough to be approved to study in a free public college and your  financies were good enough that would allow you to pay for a private one,  your kid could sue you and force you to pay his education. \n\nNo judge would accept the argument that you payed an allowance or gave him some savings and because of that  you are free from your responsibilities and it is all his fault for being immature ( like most teens and young adults) and spending it. You would badly loose in court.\n\nHowever you are in USA, the child is yours and also your conscious.  If it was me I would never let the future of my kid be in jeopardy,  I would pay for both kids and let that money you gave for them to be used as they want as you said in the beginning of the text.", "Option 3: Make a deal that if he gets good grades, maintains a job during the summer, and graduates you will pay a portion of his student loans up to $x each year after graduation. You could extend this to your daughter too.", "YTA he can't get loans because of you. Specifically because you make to much for him to qualify and can easily send them both to school but you are choosing not to because you are a pompous asshole.", "YTA. Unreasonable to expect your child to invest his Christmas, birthday money etc even if you told them they should. he's too young to have made that decision. Why couldn't you have just put the money into a college fund if you wanted them to save it for college.", "YTA and so is your ex\n\nYou shouldn't make your kids pay for their own college cause they made an arbitrary choice at a young dumb age. (Which they're still at) You should be helping pay for both and so should your ex. Your daughter happened to save all that money and that could help her get a home or apartment and live more comfortable. Your kids education comes first always FULL STOP!", "why are you making your kids make long term financial decisions before they\u2019ve finished puberty? you\u2019ve created a situation that\u2019s unfair to both of them. not helping you son is unfair to him, but helping him is unfair to your daughter, who gave up spending through her teen years because of this. YTA", "YTA, you can easily afford to send both of your kids to whatever college they want so stop fucking about and just do that", "The only option I see here is that you could pay for both of their college and allow your daughter to use her saved money to live on while studying while not giving your son anything extra. Causing him to have to work while your daughter will have a much easier time. That way they both get the education experience they have earned.", "nothing says \"spend your money now\" like losing it all in some bullshit your parents talked you into investing in. I can relate with about 3 years of mortgage payments and 0 house ownership over my mom's place. Welp I invested, I lost the money, and I got jaded and bought a trans am.", "Agree, I definitely think this idea was poorly planned out and actually very sad.. at least start out gradually maybe putting money aside into high yields savings. investments as a teenager seems pretty risky. be prepared for the kids to have built up resentment wish both of them the best", "Helped in the initial setup, but nothing since from what i have seen.", "He should encourage community college. The kind of behavior this kid has shown isn't one of a responsible young adult. If he just pays for whatever the kid wants, it shows that past behavior has no bearing or consequence. He'll end up being a 7 year sophomore or something. \n\nSince OP says he can afford the best, I'd add a stipulation that if son does well for the first 2 years at community college, he'll help with the next few at state or whatever.\n\nAlso, he should consider how daughter would feel seeing brother rewarded for his shenanigans. I'm sure there were times she would have splurged, bought a nicer car, more expensive clothes, etc. But she did the right thing and was responsible. Seeing bro given everything he could want would devalue her good decisions.\n\nThis is a teachable moment for them. And it isn't like sending someone to community college to start their degree is life altering or a debilitating start to your career. If you do 2 years and transfer to a different school to finish your degree, you end up with the same degree as someone that did all 4 years at the same uni.", "Why didn't he put enough money in both their college funds to go to a good uni for the length of an undergrad at least, since he can easily afford it? It's great that daughter invested well, but that should be extra money, not part of their college fund. I'm Italian so it might be a cultural thing as here it's completely different, but it's absolutely insane to me that parents wouldn't make sure their kids get as much and as good of an education as they possibly can.", "Nah, sorry. You can't, as an adult, just keep repeating the same action with a child, get annoyed you get the same result, then blame the *literal child*. OP is claiming to be moneybags but is *damaging his kids education* because he wasn't a money savvy *literal child*.\n\nMe and my brother had savings our whole lives. I always saved more than him. I always had more than him. By the time I was 18 I easily had half as much again as he did. I was the financially sensible child.\n\nFast forward a few years and he used his *to put a deposit on a house* and I fucking pissed mine away on travel, a frivolous masters I didn't need to improve my job prospects but wanted to do because I wanted to, and rent because I only had a part time job post uni.\n\nNo regrets, literally I'm fine. But I think anyone can see *buying a house* was the solid adult financial decision.\n\nOP has plenty of money by his own admission. \"This is solely for education\" is not all that rewarding. You pretty much need a degree now for basic entry level jobs (unless you do a trade, but actually half of those need qualifications too). Don't fuck your children over to make a point. \n\nIf you think it's \"unfair\" to the daughter then give her the same amount of funds so she's using *your* money not her childhood savings money to go to college. YTA OP.", "In the US at least, a 17 year old can\u2019t legally get a loan ok their own. A parent would have had to co-sign. At least one parent seems to be completely failing this kid.", "Doesn\u2019t sound like the mother is turning the son against the dad. The dad makes it clear every time he describes or mentions his son that he resents that the son reminds him of his ex and he prefers his daughter. I\u2019d bet that\u2019s why his som didn\u2019t spent much time at his house through the years (therefore earning less allowance in the first place, as he says). No kid wants to be with a parent who clearly dislikes them.", "But OP's edit makes it clear this is purely punitive because he could easily afford to send them both to their dream schools. He underfunded their college funds. If he truly couldn't afford more so be it, but it's obvious the only reason he's doing this is because he disagrees with the financial decisions of a teenage boy \ud83d\ude44.

Talking about \"fault\" as a parent in this way is the wrong frame of mind. Hope you never have kids.", "Clearly she favours the son just as much as she's accusing OP of favouring their daughter.", "\"Yes, literal children should be expected to make great life choices \ud83d\ude44.\"\n\nPlaying devil's advocate here: he's not a child anymore but is *still* making poor financial decisions, in OP's opinion. However, for the sake of argument, if we still consider him a child because he is still spending like he did when younger, then as a child, he shouldn't be trusted to make great life choices **now**, either, and so shouldn't be trusted with further money, right?", "Teenagers graduating high school are not \u201cliterally children\u201d and it\u2019s a disservice to them to be labeled as such.", "Op should not put the responsibility of financial investment/spending on childs.", "To be honest. I WISH my grandma (who raised me) had done something like this for me. I was never taught any money management skills when I was younger and as an adult I\u2019m still in the same boat. If someone had put the time in to teaching me a lesson like this or even been able to contribute to my college fund would have been a dream come true, and probably would have greatly improved the quality of my life right now. The fact that OP can provide ANY college fund is a huge privilege that a lot of people don\u2019t get. And to me it sounds like the fund the son has is still a considerable amount of money. If OP just gives the son everything he wants all the time how will he function in the real world where he has to work for what he wants? And what is college if not the place to learn how to function in the real world? NTA imo.", "Yes. Honestly the smartest option. But kids do want all the bells and whistles that come from the \"full college experience\" or whatever", "But who allowed him to get a brand new car? Who co-signed? If he\u2019s 17 I doubt he financed it.", "Yes, I know? That doesn't contradict what I said.\n\n The only lesson OP taught his son with this little allowance scheme is that he should spend it rather than invest because an investment could just fail.", "Yes!!!! At my son's school they even let you take classes in place of lunch. There were kids taking 9 classes at a time, and of course many of them were AP.  I honestly can't understand why we think torturing students this way is good for them. If you play a sport or are in various activities, you never sleep. I think this is one of the reasons kids are so stressed today. Also, I'm so glad your grandparents helped with your loans. Those can be absolutely crippling.", "That OP is letting their daughter use her own money for education would tell me they probably aren't the stereotype you're thinking of. In which case, maybe paying for their educations wouldn't all of a sudden make them that way. Besides, OP can attach strings to the money - it can only be used on tuition and books. I don't think anyone's saying to give them some kind of free-for-all-party-fun-time.", "I don't understand the 4 years at CC bc isn't CC only a 2 yr associates program?", "We dont know how much he gave them. Its all relative to lifestyle. Maybe when he says can afford 2 years a a college he means with a good lifestyle (probably not but Im sure you understand the point). \n\nHe has clearly been trying to teach them how to manage money but the son has gone against what he has taught whereas the daughter has listened to his lessons. He's clearly given them enough for college and a lesson in life. All the time the son is entitled and blames hi, the son cant be trusted with extra. Maybe if the son came to him and said sorry for not listening he might agree to loan the son enough money to get through or even pay. \n\nAt the end of the day the son has shown he doesnt understand the value of money and still needs to learn the lesson.", "I was thinking the same. I get that OP wants to teach them the value of money, but that should be a different lesson to their college funds. Since he can afford it, send them both to a good college for 4 years and the money they have saved/invested will still be there when they graduate"]}
