I vote that you change your mailing address to somewhere he doesn't have access to and you are NTA.", "Marinara flags galore! He is trying to control every aspect of your life and punishing you like a child when you talk back. You don't have much invested in this relationship. It might be time to start planning to leave.", "NTA I don't open my husband's mail, usually. Been married 25 years. That guy is a king size quilt of red flags.", "NTA. \n\nIt's literally a federal crime to open mail not addressed to you in the U.S. \n\nHe's projecting his insecurities. It's there a way you can get a p.o. box if you can't get mail at your own residence?", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s untrustworthy!! Stop sending your mail to his place for Pete\u2019s sake!", "NTA. Not only is it illegal for him to do that, this should make you wonder why he doesn't want to date women his own age. R.U.N.", "NTA. This is only the beginning. Get the fuck away from that man.", "You will be miserable if you stay with this guy. I don\u2019t open my husbands mail and we have been married for fifteen years. He is controlling and it\u2019s very weird. What ever you do DO NOT have a baby with him or your life will be over.", "NTA 7 months. Sweet you\u2019re not that invested. Run. He\u2019s too old and controlling. He will only get worse.", "NTA. I don\u2019t even just open my wife\u2019s mail. If it looks important I\u2019ll send a pic of the envelope and ask if it\u2019s something she wants me to open now.", "Of course you're NTA but stories like this make me so sad. You're 23 years old, living with a man 15 years older than you, and you really need internet strangers to tell you what an unhealthy situation this is?", "NTA but - why ARE you getting mail there?  Are you living with him and his parents?", "Why are you getting mail sent to his family home? Why are you with a 38yo when you are 23? NTA but you really need to think about your life choices.", "Run", "Have your mail switched to one of the mail stores or even a post office box. Put in a change of address.  Go online and change your address individually.  If you have a mailbox business that lets you use their street address and accepts deliveries, get your Amazon deliveries there.

Do you have his phone password, etc.", "My partner struggles with executive function and anxiety and dealing with correspondence. I do almost all that stuff for them, including dealing with all the correspondence from the SSA and VA for their ongoing disability cases.

Even if it\u2019s the hundredth letter from the VA I know they\u2019re gonna want me to open for them and read, I ALWAYS ask if they want me to open it for them. Because it\u2019s their fucking mail!! NTA and run.", "Opening someone else's mail is illegal. Pretending he's a victim and that you must be hiding something is a huge red flag. That's 2 strikes.", "NTA, I've been married 14 years never opened my husband's mail. Huge red flag LEAVE HIM. He is controlling and disrespectful", "I have been married for 24 years and I have never opened my spouse's mail and he has never opened mine", "OMG. Just leave.  I\u2019m pretty sure you already know this relationship isn\u2019t right for you.

Are you living with him at his family\u2019s house? I am guessing so since your mail is going there. Get out of this relationship.  What kind of person tells their SO that not getting to open their mail makes them rethink how they feel about you? He is 15 years older and is trying to control you!  Get out!  Date a young guy your age and have fun! Be respected! This guy is showing you who he is\u2014believe him and run!!!", "Your boyfriend is the AH, time for him to go! It starts with mail and then escalates into other controlling and manipulative behaviors. Definitely NTA.", "Easy NTA. I\u2019ve been married for 25 years and my husband still won\u2019t open mail addressed to me even unless I expressly ask him to. This man does not respect your privacy and your boundaries.", "It's not just the claims of hiding something and being untrustworthy, but saying that it's changes the way he views her and changes the dynamic of the relationship that is a huge red flag.\n\nIt comes across like he is trying to gas light her into thinking she is in the wrong, and guilt her into accepting his controlling and manipulative behavior.", "Another red flag is that age difference..", "Obviously giant ass red flags over here! And also not at all an unreasonable request, as above said, it's illegal. I don't even open my bf's mail and we've been living together for over 4 years. Or I open it in front of him after he tells me to (because he's lazy). Get outta there for your own sake", "Change the dynamic of your relationship by leaving. NOW.\nNTA.", "Hopping on, run girl!!!!", "It does change the nature of their relationship, she\u2019s standing up for herself and setting boundaries which he clearly figured she wouldn\u2019t being do.

I wouldn't open my husband's mail without asking him first. That's the thing with mail - you shouldn't open it if it isn't addressed to you. People who don't understand that have issues.", "Never. If it doesn\u2019t have my name on it, I don\u2019t open it. This was just something basic my parents taught me as a little kid, and they afforded me that courtesy back.", "I\u2019ve been married nearly ten years, and would never open my husband\u2019s mail without asking, and then only if it\u2019s obviously a bill I\u2019m expecting and planning to pay. He doesn\u2019t open mine either. It is the law, and also basic respect.", "Exception was my mom who got backed up on mail so i went through it to recycle junk and sort what remained.", "I mentioned that it was illegal and that was pretty much ignored because \u201cI\u2019m hiding something\u201d.", "Very and it explains the age gap", "And he\u2019s 15 years older than her.  Easier to manipulate.  Ruuuun", "\n\nThis is excellent advice! OP, please check on your credit and freeze at all three bureaus. You should review everything that occurred in the last year with a fine tooth comb.  If he's opening your mail, there's a good chance you aren't receiving everything. \n\nI've been married for 15 years, My husband checks the mail everyday and leaves everything in my name on my desk in my office. We order a lot of stuff online and do not open each other's packages without checking in first. The only time I can recall him ever opening something addressed to me without asking first was a W2 we had been waiting on so that he could jump on our taxes. Your boyfriend is displaying very alarming behavior.", "This is a really good point.", "The mail-opening thing would be a dealbreaker no matter what age he was.

At this point honestly I\u2019d just ghost him. Change that mailing address and vanish.", "These men like younger women because they do not have the bullshit detectors that women their own age have developed through years of dealing with them.

And his \"family's home\", is this guy nearing 40 and living with his parents? and dating a 23 yo?", "13. Are you living with him and his family?\n14. Are you financially dependent on him or his family?", "OP mentions they were getting the mail delivered at his house, so it's likely he found it at home before OP could?", "Exactly, and it\u2019s working, since she is asking us instead of walking out the door.", "I don\u2019t open my spouses mail, or he mine without asking.  We\u2019ve been married for more than 35 years.\n\nUsually the asking is an interesting bit of junk mail.  I tend to just chuck it.  Or if there\u2019s one with handwriting, try to guess if it\u2019s from an insurance company, a religious person trying to convert me, or a crematorium service.  When you hit your later 60\u2019s, junk mail gets weirdly eclectic.", "if you're going to [steal other people's comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10nwh5s/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriend_not_to_open_my_mail/j6bc68b/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) you could at least not copy them almost word-for-word", "People who immediately jump to, \"you're hiding something\" are ALWAYS hiding something themselves... just saying.", "Even if you were hiding something, that doesn't make it any less illegal.", "This guy is scary controlling and possessive.

I didn\u2019t think so. \n\nBeware that he might also have your online passwords so those need changed immediately.
