SIL has always gotten parenting inspiration from celebrities and online blogs. The first clue something was off was when our niece came to us and told us that our son (14M) wasn't giving her his Switch to play first. I explained to her that the Switch is his so she had to ask nicely for a turn, and it was up to him to share. When it was time for the 8 and 9 y/o's bathtime I told them to get ready for their baths, our niece shouted \"I'm first!\" and went to get her stuff. At bedtime, I asked them what story they wanted read, and again it was our niece that answered.\n\nThe following day they wanted to watch a show, and I told them to agree on one. Our niece went \"We're watching (show name here)\". I told her that she needed to talk to her brothers to find something all 3 of them agree on. Her response was boys always pick everything so I took that to mean that her brothers often pick and let her put on the show. When it was dinnertime, my husband called everyone to the kitchen and was plating food up for the kids on a first-come, first-serve basis. Our son got in there first and our niece told him that he needed to wait because she and Auntie go first because girls go first. My husband explained that at dinner time dinner is served as you get in the kitchen or take turns so no one goes first all the time. Bathtime and bedtime story was the same thing- she wanted to go first and pick first, so I told her since she got to go first with both the night prior, one of her brothers got to go first that night. She said that she was supposed to go first because 'girls first' and that's how their parents do it.\n\nHere's where I may be an ahole- I explained to her that in our house, we share and we take turns. That's how things went for the next two days until their parents called and she told my SIL that we weren't following the rules. I talked to SIL and she was upset that I changed the kids' routine without talking to her about it first because she was just trying to provide an environment for her daughter where she would take precedence. I told SIL she never mentioned these 'rules and routines' when she asked us to keep the kids and even if she had, I wouldn't have agreed to them since they would, and have, impacted my own child. I also told her she's not providing an environment to make her daughter feel valued and special, she's raising her to be entitled and being unfair to her sons. The following day my husband's parents showed up to pick up the kids and since then, his relationship with his sister has been strained.

Yikes... that's a crazy way to raise a daughter. Your SIL isn't doing her any favors. She'll be shocked when she enters the world as an adult and realizes nobody cares about her rules/opinions.", "NTA. Her thought process makes no sense. It's fine to make sure your daughter knows she's valued and special. It's definitely not okay to teach her that because she's a girl, she'll always get to be first or always get her way. You're correct, she's just teaching her to be an entitled brat!", "NTA. Your SIL is sexist and is raising your niece to be sexist as well.", "Nope your house your rules (which 100% healthier in my opinion). NTA. What a terrible way to raise her kids. Yikes. I feel sorry for the people who have to deal with niece in the future in the real world. How is school going to go with that attitude or dating? Geez.", "NTA - You weren't feeding them food they shouldn't have or letting them stay up until 2:00 a.m., you were simply requiring common courtesy and fairness instead of pandering to \"Miss Princess Diva I'm Going to be an Entitled Social Media Influenzer When I Grow Up.\"  What SIL is talking about is not a \"routine\", it's a mindset of selfish entitlement that is going to lead her sons to despise her daughter and her daughter to be shallow, self-centered and very unpopular when she gets older.", "NTA and your comments about her learning entitlement are correct. Kids should learn \u201cbeing cool\u201d, which is sharing, not whining when things aren\u2019t 100% perfect, and adapting, going with the flow of life. Life will wallop you hard if you don\u2019t learn these basic coping skills. Nice work OP.", "NTA. This isn't even a routine. This is someone trying to instill sexism in their children. Nope nope nope", "NTA\n\nThat's just dumb. She can't possibly expect you to take care of her 3 kids exactly the way she would, upending your own rules and routine to do so.", "NTA\n\nYou are right. She is raising her daughter to be entitled and her sons will resent her for it and will go low to no contact if she doesn't stop making them feel that the daughter is more important. It will also ruin their self confidence as their parents made them to be lower than their little sister. \n\nIf the \"routine\" was so important she would have brought it up but did not. I think your way is the better way.", "NTA but your SIL is if she thinks another household is going to be an exact replica of hers for an entire week of free babysitting.  Different families have different ways of doing things and that is to be expected. It would have been ridiculous of you to contact your SIL while she was on vacation to clarify who gets to get a plate first. Notice how she didn't bother to mention this rule to you before she dropped the kids off?  Because it's dumb and inconsequential.  Be happy you won't be asked to babysit again, it sounds like a no-win situation (and your niece sounds like she's becoming a brat).", "NTA\nDifferent houses have different rules and routines. A 9 year old is old enough to know this and to not always be first. It is strange to teach one child they should always take precedence over their siblings.\n\nThe parents did not tell you their \u201crules\u201d in advance. If they wanted to make sure they were followed they should have discussed it before leaving their kids with you.", "NTA and good on you guys for showing your husband's nephews that their opinions count, at least for 2 days. Those poor boys!\n\nYour SIL should have explained her strange rules to you at the outset, so you could have had this discussion and refused to look after them at the outset. Your house your rules.\n\nYour husband's relationship with his sister should be strained. Their values don't align and she is ruining her daughter. I'm not saying withdraw, actually he needs to continue having robust conversations with her and challenging her views. \n\nHow did it take so long for you guys to pick up on this or is it a new initiative? Surely this amount of misandry comes out in family gatherings? What does his parents think or are they copping out to keep the peace?", "NTA She went too far the other way", "This reminds me of \"Ladies First,\" from \"Free to be You and Me.\" (Yes, I'm old.)\nNTA\n[Ladies First by Marlo Thomas](https://youtu.be/0NkYlelUUck)", "NTA.  Your house.  Your rules.", "\"AITA for deviating from their routine instead of bringing it up to my SIL first?\"\n\nNo, NTA\n\nIt's not like you're giving Milk to a child that's lactose intolerant, keeping them up past their  bedtime or trying to convert the kids to a new religion.  In your house, everyone waits for their turn.", "NTA, and wow your SIL is full of herself.  I have to guess that she was treated like a princess growing up, which is what got her here.  That's an excellent way to raise an entitled, bratty child who thinks she needs designer brands just because she's her.  When you ask someone to watch your kids, you have to understand that your rules aren't going to be followed (health reasons aside).  They're going to have to adapt to the temporary housing situation.", "NTA\n\nThese children are old enough to handle a temporary change in routine and it's good for them to learn that different households do things differently", "NTA.  There could be a slight debate if you didn't have a child of your own, but you've got your own rules and routines around the house for children and they need to acclimate.  Thr same as if your child stayed at a friends house you would hope he didnt try to force them into his routine.  You were doing them a favor.", "NTA especially because you didn\u2019t even know about this \u201crule\u201d in the first place. Even if you *had* known, still N T A.

Social media can be such a disease. :-)", "Reverse sexism is still sexism.", "The closest explanation I got for why she didn't mention it was that her kids knew the rules, and she didn't think our 14 year old would eat dinner with the family at that age so it wouldn't be an issue.", "I've been wracking my brain for the past few weeks since it's happened to think of things I overlooked. At family gatherings it hasn't been blatantly obvious, or at least the *why* aspect of it hasn't been. I always thought the boys were just introverted or not in a rush because they've always just waited after their sister for SIL to make their plates at gatherings in recent years. Niece has her toys at my in-laws and SIL's place, the boys have theirs, and I've never been privy to their bedtime routines before. SIL said she started to implement it after reading about some celebrities doing the same thing to encourage their daughters.\n\nHis parents think she's just raising her sons to be gentlemen.", "Oh gods lol Thankfully niece isn't that kind of obnoxious but I do fear she could wind up that way.", "That is a bizarre explanation. Regardless, your house your rules when it comes to such minor issues.", "Why would she think your kid wouldn't eat with his family? That makes no sense. Does she expect him to buy and make his own food or something... Honestly that kind of worrying about how her son's will treated in a few years.", "But she's not 'encouraging' her daughter, she is teaching her to be a brat. Why do her sons always have to cater to the daughter? It might work now but when the eldest son becomes a teenager, all bets are off. He might not be so willing to let 'Miss Ladies First' have her way all the time.\n\nAnd most 'celebrities' are either not raising their children themselves or going to extreme ends to raise them. It's rare that you hear about children of famous people who are actually normal and down to earth (and I do hope that she means real celebrities and not social influencers who are known to lie). The problem with this kind of childrearing policy is that it can have lasting effects on the siblings. The boys are not going to want to have anything to do with her when they are grown and the girl will not understand why her wants aren't being  put first by anyone outside her family.", "\"And so she was. And mighty tasty, too!\" The whole film is g-rated. A good thing to have playing when next you babysit...", "No she expected that he would be a moody teenager and eat whenever he wanted and take his food to his room. Apparently thats what all the teenagers she knows of does.", "I might if there's ever a next time. I'm hoping she relaxes and stops keeping her distance soon, it's been almost 3 weeks.", "That's crazy! Plus she thought a 'moody teenager' would just hand over his switch the moment his cousin demanded it?  No way\n\nYour SIL needs a healthy dose of reality", "Your SIL might actually like it. It is a very family-friendly, feminist film from the 1970s."]}
