I feel sorry for the boys growing up being stymied by these \u201crules\u201d she\u2019s teaching the boys to be door mats (like her husband seems to be) to women.", "NTA. I was ready with a YTA based on the title, because routines are important, but this isn\u2019t routines at all\u2014it\u2019s house rules. Your SIL needs to read a dictionary instead of a blog.\n\nWe have certain actual routines for our daughter around baths and sleeping and meals, for example, and we ask that people maintain that when they watch her overnight because she\u2019s two and needs routine. BUT we are clear that the house rules we follow are set by whose house we\u2019re in. If Grammy doesn\u2019t want you touching that at her house, hands off.\n\nSIL can\u2019t expect you to run your home her way just because her kids are there.\n\nAnd, fwiw, I\u2019d be just fine with your house rules if you wete babysitting my kid.", "NTA - Good Grief . . . your house your rules. Their daughter will be sadly disappointed in life where women don't always get to be first . . .  I wonder what happens in school? Is their rule for girls first a rule at the school too?", "NTA. How unfair are the brothers gonna be treated in the future, i can imagine if the sil takes it too far, she will raise an annoyance of a girl and th2 boys could be frustrated, shy and introverted and think they are worth lesser or something like that. And yeah, your house, your rules!", "Does your SIL have a low IQ?  This is crazy in 2023!!! How on earth does everyone's school day go? I'm surprised the princess isn't getting bullies or ostracized by the other students.", "NTA\n\nYour house your rules. And your rules weren\u2019t causing any harm to anyone. You weren\u2019t ignoring their health or their care.\n\nMy mom pulled lower key versions of this. Part of the reason my sister are bat shit crazy.", "NTA - your SIL is unhinged and creating a monster. But on the bright side she will not ship 3 kids off to you for a week again!", "NTA and I'm worried for all those kids. Sons might end up resenting women, daughter might mess with the wrong man. Just all around awful way to raise kids", "NTA. I'm taking your SIL's whole \"My approach to parenting is to make my daughter feel entitled and make my sons feel like crap\" thing out of it. I've told my friends this before I've done (free) kid sitting for them. If you come back and your kid is alive, I've done my job. If you come back and your kids have no significant injuries, I've done a good job. If you come back and your kids have eaten three times a day and gotten some sleep, I AM THE BEST KID SITTER IN THE WORLD. Anything beyond that? Anything like, \"Susie only eats vegan and must go to bed at 8.30, NEVER 8.45,\" is really beyond my remit. Hire a professional babysitter if you have specific rules that need to be followed this closely.", "I'd say that the less you see of that SIL asshole the better. It is perfectly ok to allow assholes to not like you, even family. You are 100% right and she is 100% wrong. Unless she is going to apologize or alter her position, she can go fuck herself.", "This is just ridiculous. My husband is very old school Southern gentleman. When we go out to eat he always says \"ladies first\" and me and my daughter order and then him and our son. My daughter and I are always gracious, not bossy about it.  What the SIL is doing is next level dangerous. Its going to raise a brat!! Manners were invented to unite, not divide. **NTA**", "NTA -this is bizarre. All she is doing is creating an entitled daughter and potentially resentful sons. It\u2019s not teaching the boys to value and respect women, but you making a stand and requiring your niece to share probably made an impact on your nephews. Your SIL does not get to dictate the rules in your house, particularly since it would impact your son. SIL is a huge asshole and her sons are going to grow up hating her and your niece.", "NTA. Your SIL is not only sexist, but also doing a huge disservice to her daughter. What the heck is this kid going to do when she has to wait at a medical office or in line at the grocery store?", "[removed]", "NTA, that's the most ridiculous version of 'parenting' I've heard of. In the end it will make females spoiled and entitled, while the boys are always forced to be last and never get what they'd prefer!", "From the title alone prepared for Y but clearly it is NTA Seriously this is ridiculous. Especially if they didn't tell you.", "NTA SIL is blatantly sexist and I feel bad for her sons. \nAlso the kid will be a nightmare so maybe don\u2019t look after her anymore", "NTA.  Your SIL didn't do her homework.  Somehow she simply assumed you would read her mind and blindly follow her in-home procedures.  Of course you followed your own practices in your own home.  That is what adults do.  By keeping her distance, she is doing your family a favor.", " NTA.\n\nShe's doing everybody a disservice. \n\nShe's delegitimizing her son's choices, personalities, and property.\n\nThe girls go first motif also often comes with more insidious undertones that will be terrible for her as she gets older.\n\nThat such things would've impacted your child is a huge issue that she should've known wouldn't fly.", "Not just the daughter, what a crazy way to raise their sons!!!\n\nNTA", "Also SIL is this even the real reason, or is it SIL just playing favorites or trying to compensate for own feelings of powerlessness.  Either way, shudder.\n\nAlso, niece complains that your house doesn't do things exactly how their house does and SIL's response is too scold YOU instead of just saying \"every house if different.\"", "\"Influenzer\" deserves an award. \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0", "I feel sorry for the nephews that have no say at all in anything, like they dont even exist. Can't tell me they shouldn't be going to counselung because they're going to have problems growing up in that atmosphere.", "This is one of our concerns: the boys will grow up to have their kindness taken advantage of by the wrong kind of woman. Her husband goes along with it and lets her set the tone for parenting, which is fine if that's the life he wants but I personally feel he needs to advocate for all of his children so they are better prepared for life and teach them that relationships and treatment aren't one-size-fits-all.", "According to SIL she has told her daughter that the rules are only for family. She does act normal with her female cousins at bigger family gatherings.", "They are already quiet, and were quiet when they were with us.

I just thought it was so good that I wanted to see it gain popularity.", "She definitely was not disregarded in favor of my husband, neither her nor their sister.

All teenagers are the same there, more or less", "If she\u2019s raising one kid to take precedence over the other two I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s gonna end up with at least one moody teenager", "Can you talk to her boys and see how they feel? Someone really needs to intervene in that household...", "Oh you mean the same famous idiots who boast about not bathing their kids and refusing to give them an inheritance?", "I would talk to our nephews about it, as I stated, before I never really thought much about some things but now I am. The boys have always been quiet and I thought it was because they were shy or introverted, but now we're worried that it might be over how SIL is raising the three of them. I can't imagine that constantly being second is good for anyone. I will talk to my husband more about when we see the kids again whenever she stops being mad at us.", "NTA. Quite aside from this approach not seeming to do much other than make your niece feel entitled \u2014 including to your son\u2019s own property \u2014 these rules were never explained to you by the parents, in advance. Any unusual rules need to have been explained to you ahead of time, so that you were getting the information straight from the parents and could choose whether they were rules you were comfortable enforcing. Instead you were apparently supposed to take instructions from a demanding 9yo, and couldn\u2019t back out from taking care of the kids.\n\nNo advance instructions means they\u2019re agreeing with you parenting your way. Your way seems like a fine way. And you\u2019re right, they don\u2019t get to set rules that affect your own child in your own home.", "NTA. They got free childcare for a week, did not set the rules ahead of time, and now are upset that you didn't guess how they wanted you to behave? Your SIL could show little more gratitude. And next time let them take their kids to the wedding/vacation or pay for a nanny.", "NTA. Your sister in law didn't tell you this beforehand. It's not her house, not her rules. She can be mad all she wants. Let her. People need to learn to they can't get their way all the time and can be disappointed.", "Nta, I know we're all worried about your niece, but what about your nephews? Are they going to grow up resentful with the belief that there is no inequality because \"women get everything\" as misogynists like to preach? Or will they allow their girlfriends to be controlling towards them and make all the decisions because they've been taught that it's normal? Your sister isn't teaching feminism and equality. She's teaching that women are better and men are inferior and it's going to mess up all the kids.", "NTA.\n\nBut, why are so many adults playing into this delusional woman's beliefs?

My grandma had a big part in raising my two little cousins (boy and girl) and while the boy was expected to open doors for us girls, we were also expected to be polite say thank you when he did. In all other ways he and his sister were treated equally; the girl is now a strong young woman and the boy is happily married to a woman who appreciates the fact that he steps up and does half the housework and child-rearing (no babysitting father here!). \n\nSIL is teaching her daughter to be a tyrant and her sons to be doormats. I don't see that going well for any of them.", "Of course it's because the daughter is being put on a pedestal. Do you have any idea what it's like to be neglected like this?
