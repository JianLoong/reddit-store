SIL has always gotten parenting inspiration from celebrities and online blogs. The first clue something was off was when our niece came to us and told us that our son (14M) wasn't giving her his Switch to play first. I explained to her that the Switch is his so she had to ask nicely for a turn, and it was up to him to share. When it was time for the 8 and 9 y/o's bathtime I told them to get ready for their baths, our niece shouted \"I'm first!\" and went to get her stuff. At bedtime, I asked them what story they wanted read, and again it was our niece that answered.\n\nThe following day they wanted to watch a show, and I told them to agree on one. Our niece went \"We're watching (show name here)\". I told her that she needed to talk to her brothers to find something all 3 of them agree on. Her response was boys always pick everything so I took that to mean that her brothers often pick and let her put on the show. When it was dinnertime, my husband called everyone to the kitchen and was plating food up for the kids on a first-come, first-serve basis. Our son got in there first and our niece told him that he needed to wait because she and Auntie go first because girls go first. My husband explained that at dinner time dinner is served as you get in the kitchen or take turns so no one goes first all the time. Bathtime and bedtime story was the same thing- she wanted to go first and pick first, so I told her since she got to go first with both the night prior, one of her brothers got to go first that night. She said that she was supposed to go first because 'girls first' and that's how their parents do it.\n\nHere's where I may be an ahole- I explained to her that in our house, we share and we take turns. That's how things went for the next two days until their parents called and she told my SIL that we weren't following the rules. I talked to SIL and she was upset that I changed the kids' routine without talking to her about it first because she was just trying to provide an environment for her daughter where she would take precedence. I told SIL she never mentioned these 'rules and routines' when she asked us to keep the kids and even if she had, I wouldn't have agreed to them since they would, and have, impacted my own child. I also told her she's not providing an environment to make her daughter feel valued and special, she's raising her to be entitled and being unfair to her sons.

Kids should learn \u201cbeing cool\u201d, which is sharing, not whining when things aren\u2019t 100% perfect, and adapting, going with the flow of life.

Notice how she didn't bother to mention this rule to you before she dropped the kids off?  Because it's dumb and inconsequential.

A 9 year old is old enough to know this and to not always be first. It is strange to teach one child they should always take precedence over their siblings.\n\nThe parents did not tell you their \u201crules\u201d in advance.

I'm not saying withdraw, actually he needs to continue having robust conversations with her and challenging her views. \n\nHow did it take so long for you guys to pick up on this or is it a new initiative?

That's an excellent way to raise an entitled, bratty child who thinks she needs designer brands just because she's her.  When you ask someone to watch your kids, you have to understand that your rules aren't going to be followed (health reasons aside).  They're going to have to adapt to the temporary housing situation.", "NTA\n\nThese children are old enough to handle a temporary change in routine and it's good for them to learn that different households do things differently", "NTA.
