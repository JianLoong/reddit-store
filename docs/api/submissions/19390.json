Anne has a 3 year old daughter. We were talking, and Anne was telling us about how after she dyed her hair her daughter had been begging for \u201chair like mommy\u2019s\u201d and would take markers and try to color her hair. It was a cute story and everyone laughed. But then she followed up with \u201cI\u2019m going to wait until she\u2019s a bit older. I can\u2019t imagine dyeing her hair this young. How did you manage it from so young XXX? That\u2019\u2019s actual abuse .\u201d \n\nAnd I\u2019m just sitting there not knowing what was going on and I ask her what she means. She said she thought my mom\u2019s been dyeing my hair since I was a kid because I\u2019ve been \u201cblond forever\u201d. I\u2019ve never colored my hair before, so I ask her why she thinks my hair is dyed. She said since I\u2019m \u201cArab and brown\u201d that she just thought that my mom was dyeing my hair like Jojo Siwa\u2019s did. Explanation: Jojo is a dancer (my friends and I all watched dance moms religiously) and she\u2019s said in the past her mom has been dyeing her hair blond since she was 2. Anne said she could never put her daughter through that.\n\nI started laughing but I apologized immediately afterwards. I\u2019m sorry, looking back that was a mean reaction but I couldn\u2019t help it. If I could change that reaction, I would. \nAlso, since when can\u2019t Arabs be naturally blond? I\u2019m Lebanese-Syrian and some of my family members have light brown/blond/red hair. \n\nShe was hurt that I laughed at her, which I get because no one likes being laughed at. I sent her apology cookies the next day because I felt bad. She accepted my apology,  but then said she couldn\u2019t a few days later. So I apologized again, she accepted but then changed her mind again. We went through this cycle thrice before she \u201caccepted\u201d my apology again. But then yesterday, I get a message from her saying she can\u2019t get over it and will let me know when she\u2019s ready to hear my apology again. \n\nI was pretty done with her so I just sent her a message saying \u201cI\u2019m not going to apologize again. I\u2019ve sincerely apologized multiple times, but if you can\u2019t accept that it\u2019s better if we aren\u2019t friends anymore\u201d\n\nShe just called me a bitch and blocked me.

Your response could have been to be upset with her, and that would have been justified.  \n\nSHE should be apologizing to YOU.  SHE should be thanking YOU for being gracious and not pointing out how totally uncool she was.  \n\nLet her be mad.  NTA.", "A heartfelt apology *and cookies* no less! I think Anne just really liked the baked goodies and was hoping to guilt OP into making more.\n\nNTA, OP. Accept the backhanded compliment to your baking skills and cut her out of your life. \n\nI personally have no gd patience for the kind of back-and-forth, flip-flopping behavior described here. Healthy adults don't spend day after day playing wishy-washy head games over a chuckle. Forgive me or don't. But regardless, you're not Lucy, I'm not Charlie Brown, and I don't have time for this. Pick a damn lane and stay in it!", "Dying a kid hair may not be abuse, but bleaching a kid hair certainly would qualify for abuse in my mind.", "I actually do agree that forcing a very young child (who is too young to really express opinions on what they want their hair to look like/understand what it means to bleach your hair) to bleach dark hair blonde, and potentially be exposed to chemicals for hours at a time could be considered abuse, especially if the kid didn't want it.\n\nBut imo, that just makes it worse. She literally accused OP's mom of being abusive and then demanded that OP apologize to her for laughing at the suggestion.", "[removed]", "She assumed that she couldn't have blonde hair cause she was brown. On top of that, she insinuated that her mom was abusive", "Basically racist AF.\n\nAnd she knew it and was embarrassed, and tried to turn it into being the victim.", "[removed]", "I mean yes, that would be abuse. But to automatically assume it's abuse I really the wild part. But I guess if you consume a lot of reality shows about horrible people like OP and Co seem to, you might think it's the norm?\n\nIdk most kids I knew who dyed their hair were stoked to do it and weren't forced so her friend was way outta line", "[stolen comment](https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145eavh/_/jnkicx9/?context=1)", "[stolen comment](https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145eavh/_/jnkicx9/?context=1)", "Yeah, I understand that. I guess that it's just a bit of a sensitive topic for me because my mom's mom is white and her dad was Lebanese, and she and her sisters had to endure a lot of hair shaming (and forced hair treatments, sometimes) from their maternal relatives, so the comment about a Lebanese family forcing a young child to bleach her hair really just triggered a knee-jerk reaction in me.\n\nI do think that the automatic leap from 'OP is blonde' to 'OP's mom is abusive' (which is what her friend said) is fucked up, and OP really should demand an apology from the friend, or better yet, tell her she's done playing games."]}
