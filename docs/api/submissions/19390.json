Anne has a 3 year old daughter. We were talking, and Anne was telling us about how after she dyed her hair her daughter had been begging for \u201chair like mommy\u2019s\u201d and would take markers and try to color her hair. It was a cute story and everyone laughed. But then she followed up with \u201cI\u2019m going to wait until she\u2019s a bit older. I can\u2019t imagine dyeing her hair this young. How did you manage it from so young XXX? That\u2019\u2019s actual abuse .\u201d \n\nAnd I\u2019m just sitting there not knowing what was going on and I ask her what she means. She said she thought my mom\u2019s been dyeing my hair since I was a kid because I\u2019ve been \u201cblond forever\u201d. I\u2019ve never colored my hair before, so I ask her why she thinks my hair is dyed. She said since I\u2019m \u201cArab and brown\u201d that she just thought that my mom was dyeing my hair like Jojo Siwa\u2019s did. Explanation: Jojo is a dancer (my friends and I all watched dance moms religiously) and she\u2019s said in the past her mom has been dyeing her hair blond since she was 2. Anne said she could never put her daughter through that.\n\nI started laughing but I apologized immediately afterwards. I\u2019m sorry, looking back that was a mean reaction but I couldn\u2019t help it. If I could change that reaction, I would. \nAlso, since when can\u2019t Arabs be naturally blond? I\u2019m Lebanese-Syrian and some of my family members have light brown/blond/red hair. \n\nShe was hurt that I laughed at her, which I get because no one likes being laughed at. I sent her apology cookies the next day because I felt bad. She accepted my apology,  but then said she couldn\u2019t a few days later. So I apologized again, she accepted but then changed her mind again. We went through this cycle thrice before she \u201caccepted\u201d my apology again. But then yesterday, I get a message from her saying she can\u2019t get over it and will let me know when she\u2019s ready to hear my apology again. \n\nI was pretty done with her so I just sent her a message saying \u201cI\u2019m not going to apologize again. I\u2019ve sincerely apologized multiple times, but if you can\u2019t accept that it\u2019s better if we aren\u2019t friends anymore\u201d\n\nShe just called me a bitch and blocked me.

I spent my life up until high-school believing my hair would turn brown. Lol.

Do you somehow owe her unusual deference?\r  \n\r  \nEach time she accepts and then rejects, she's abusing you. WTF does that?

I think it was reasonable of your friend to assume your hair had been dyed as long as she knew, although it wasn't reasonable or nice to accuse your mom of abuse.", "NTA.

Its not a stretch for someone to genuinely not know a brown skinned person can be a natural blonde.
