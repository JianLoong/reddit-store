Anne has a 3 year old daughter. We were talking, and Anne was telling us about how after she dyed her hair her daughter had been begging for \u201chair like mommy\u2019s\u201d and would take markers and try to color her hair. It was a cute story and everyone laughed. But then she followed up with \u201cI\u2019m going to wait until she\u2019s a bit older. I can\u2019t imagine dyeing her hair this young. How did you manage it from so young XXX? That\u2019\u2019s actual abuse .\u201d \n\nAnd I\u2019m just sitting there not knowing what was going on and I ask her what she means. She said she thought my mom\u2019s been dyeing my hair since I was a kid because I\u2019ve been \u201cblond forever\u201d. I\u2019ve never colored my hair before, so I ask her why she thinks my hair is dyed. She said since I\u2019m \u201cArab and brown\u201d that she just thought that my mom was dyeing my hair like Jojo Siwa\u2019s did. Explanation: Jojo is a dancer (my friends and I all watched dance moms religiously) and she\u2019s said in the past her mom has been dyeing her hair blond since she was 2. Anne said she could never put her daughter through that.\n\nI started laughing but I apologized immediately afterwards. I\u2019m sorry, looking back that was a mean reaction but I couldn\u2019t help it. If I could change that reaction, I would. \nAlso, since when can\u2019t Arabs be naturally blond? I\u2019m Lebanese-Syrian and some of my family members have light brown/blond/red hair. \n\nShe was hurt that I laughed at her, which I get because no one likes being laughed at. I sent her apology cookies the next day because I felt bad. She accepted my apology,  but then said she couldn\u2019t a few days later. So I apologized again, she accepted but then changed her mind again. We went through this cycle thrice before she \u201caccepted\u201d my apology again. But then yesterday, I get a message from her saying she can\u2019t get over it and will let me know when she\u2019s ready to hear my apology again. \n\nI was pretty done with her so I just sent her a message saying \u201cI\u2019m not going to apologize again. I\u2019ve sincerely apologized multiple times, but if you can\u2019t accept that it\u2019s better if we aren\u2019t friends anymore\u201d\n\nShe just called me a bitch and blocked me.  Our friend group is kind of divided, I guess. Most of them are on my side but some of them think I should\u2019ve apologized until she was satisfied because I was wrong.", "created_utc": 1686338719, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145eavh/aita_for_laughing_in_my_friends_face_when_she/", "score": 112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your laughter was justified. She called dying a kid's hair abuse, which is also silly. \n\nThen you gave a heartfelt apology she accepted and then rejected 3 fucking times.\n\nAt this point you've done all you could, and more than what most folks would have been gracious enough to do. She's just being an assclown at this point and you're better off without her.", "NTA. She made an (rather racist) assumption and was wrong. She honestly sounds like an exhausting friend and you're probably better off without her.\n\nYou apologised once (even though she was the one who should apologise to you) she accepted, that should have been the end of it.\n\nIf she tries coming back and wanting another apology, tell her that you will not apologise and are waiting for an apology from her for her racist comments.", "NTA. You apologized, she\u2019s overreacting. Nothing more you can do. You even baked her cookies, for God\u2019s sake.\n\nI don\u2019t even think laughing at her is even offensive in the first place. I\u2019d have the exact same reaction that you did if someone assumed I\u2019ve been dying my hair, and I\u2019d expect a friend to do the same if it were me making the wrong assumption.

How perfectly normal. Laughter is a natural response to being told something ridiculous, especially an ignorant presumption about you.

She can pound sand and your friend group can shut up. NTA. You made the right choice to pop this pimple.", "NTA.\n\nShe assumed you were a child victim based on her own racial biases. *She* should apologize to *you.*", "Uh, no, NTA. She was the one who made assumptions about you and your family based off some racist concept that Arab people cannot have any other hair color than dark brown or black, and then got butthurt because you laughed. You then immediately apologized for laughing and gave her cookies as well! She doesn't get to keep changing her mind about accepting your apology and making you apologize over and over again.

Such an odd thing that get so upset about.", "NTA. She made a racist assumption about you and now she pays the price. You had nothing to apologize for.", "Am a Lebanese blonde. Have blonde cousins. We exist. She\u2019s kinda racist.", "NTA\nShe should apologise to you. She accused your mother of abuse, called you Arab and brown. \n\nI think laughing was a mild reaction. Don't apologise again.

She thought your hair was dyed, she now knows it is not and never has been ..... if anyone should apologize it would be her with the \"you're Arab and brown\" comment (and I would say neither of you should as it was a simple understanding)", "NTA.  She sounds awful.", "NTA on two counts - first, the one everyone mentioned of her assumption that Arab people can't have blonde hair, and second, she accused your mum of abusing you!

I don't even see a reason to apologize to her at all. She was racist and rude. She have assumed something and was rude bc of it. Laughing was well deserved.", "NolTa, and not sure why you apologized in the first place since her comment was stupid and low key racist? And then her game playing? Drop this silly woman from your friend group.", "So Anne made an assumption about you, based on racist views, you were good enough to laugh it off, then furthermore apologise multiple times for laughing.

We use color depositing conditioner since my kids are blonde, and it washes out. I guess bleach is different because it damages your hair, but so what? So what if you have a bad haircut or dye job? It grows out. \n\nFor her to call it abuse is over the line.

You\u2019re not doing it anymore. She\u2019s only upset because you embarrassed her by her own actions. \n\nShe should never have assumed that your mom started dying your hair since you were a toddler. \n\nShe\u2019s embarrassed for looking like a fool.

Your friend is having such a hard time \"accepting\" your unnecessary apology because she's trying really really hard to make YOU TA!. She knows she made a stupid assumption and now looks racist, she's just trying to assuage her guilt/embarrassment by making you jump through a bunch of apology hoops.  If I had the guess she is drawing this out for so long because she's trying to turn the tide of opinion against you. When this has stewed long enough and she has as many people as she can get on her side, she may or may not decide to officially \"forgive\" you.", "NTA, and tell your conflicted friends that you'll maybe apologize again when she apologizes for being racist and assuming \"because you're Arab you can't be naturally blonde,\" like wtf? \n\nAlso you better than me bc l honestly I wouldn't have even apologized, you pull a racism you deserve being laughed at, but you still apologized immediately, during the conversation, after the first apology and cookies was accepted then rejected I would've been done, you apologized three (technically 4) times, that's three more than you needed to. \n\nAlso I'm sorry, IDC about not being knowledgeable, or she just didn't know, I would never assume something about someone based on race/Ethnicity bc that's a recipe for disaster, it ain't worth it,  and if I did have an instrusive thought like \"Oh she's brown that blonde cant be her natural hair color \" I'd keep that thought to myself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
