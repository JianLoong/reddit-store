I can\u2019t seem to find info regarding this", "So here's the thing. Kabbalah is what's known as a closed practice. Some cultures have certain dances or songs that are reserved for certain types of people. Some have certain rituals that are secret or reserved for members. One example is that Catholic tradition reserves Communion for people who are baptized and have given confession. You're not supposed to just walk in off the street and interact with the body and blood of Christ. When people violate these practices by engaging in them when they aren't part of the permitted group, it's a form of appropriation.\n\nKabbalah is traditionally restricted to educated men with families (and I think usually they also have to be rabbis) because it's hard-core mysticism, and people who engage in mysticism without some kind of grounding can have problems. I don't mean like Lovecraft \"oooh he read an ancient book and now he's CRAAAZZZY,\" but go read some accounts of mystics. Mysticism changes a person's relationship with the world and themselves. In Jewish tradition, restricting it is a way to avoid the kind of mystic practice that separates someone from the community so hard that they sit on top of a pole until their feet rot off (Daniel the Stylite--seriously, some of the late antique and medieval Christian mystics dialed it up to 11).\n\nAnd as mysticism, it gets into stuff that's incredibly important to Jewish thought, practice, and history. In that context, it isn't just a fun book to read because you're curious. A lot of Jews treat it incredibly reverentially.\n\nAnd yes, I know that Kabbalah was appropriated by non-Jews a LONG time ago and so it's pretty easy to find the texts in English. So you're hardly the first goy to read them and you're not super likely to go hide in a cave somewhere praying until you starve.\n\nBUT what happened was your girlfriend told you that something was sacred to her. Maybe not in the most eloquent or clear way, but she did. And instead of honoring and finding out more about its importance TO HER, you took it as a challenge and, in her perspective, violated its sacredness.\n\nSo I'm not going to judge because I think you two miscommunicated, both as individuals and culturally, but I hope learning some context helps you understand why she's upset.", "I'm going with YTA\n\nI am not a religious person, but I do respect others' beliefs. She tells you a part of her religion that's a taboo to do before a certain age and you do it anyway. That shows a fairly significant amount of disrespect towards her faith. Is it silly? Yes imo, but that's just how people are with religion. It's something incredibly personal to them and if you cross boundaries they set on purpose, YTA.", " I've read through various Kabbalistic texts, Qabbalistic (Christianized versions), Golden Dawn style ceremonial magick, AND Enochian texts. And Oh The Horror, I was a 25-30 year old female at the time. There are a lot of interesting concepts and stories. I enjoyed what I learned immensely and ceremonial magick still flavors my spiritual practices to this day even though I lean more Heathen.\n\nPersonally, I see absolutely nothing wrong with curiosity. That's what drove me. I was looking for something to believe in after the typical hypocritical southern Christian childhood. I wandered through a lot of different studies over the years (hence the name, it's all about the gnosis).

If he told me I can't read some part of the Qur'an because I'm too young or whatever, I wouldn't because :\n1) like I said I'm not religious so it just doesn't interest me that much \n2) I want him to feel loved and respected in our relationship and if this tradition is important to him then so be it \ud83d\udc81\n\nIt just sounds like you're a bit of a contrarian and decided to read the text in question simply because you were asked not to.

Not eating shellfish and pork? Wanting to keep Shabbat? Etc? \n\nBeing Jewish is an ethnoreligion. Our culture is tied intrinsically to our ethnicity which is also tied to the religion. She should be allowed to practice her culture and not have it called a whim.", "Do you PRACTICE tantra, because there is WAY more to Tantra than tantric sex practices but in the west its just the sex stuff. As a practitioner of it, its pretty cringe", "Yep. The only time I saw my rabbi livid was when I was on the high school youth group board and one of the other members was harassing me and my family (she would incessantly call at 9, 10, 11 pm and text me demeaning things) it was when he had to step in since the youth advisor didn\u2019t do her job and the parents of this girl weren\u2019t getting on board with enforcing her leaving me alone.  \n\nBut that\u2019s the only time I\u2019ve seen him angry.", "please, share how else his would his girlfriend would know he read it then?", "Ah, yes, cultures who have been subjected to repeated attempts at genocide saying \u201cthe people who keep trying to murder us should stop playing dress up as us\u201d is absolutely the same as a majority group denying education and equal rights to a minority.

He read one from a place that new her and they mentioned it. She later got paranoid after realizing what she said, knowing full well he'd have to read it, and when confronted didn't he deny it. He sleep talks. She overheard a private conversation.", "Dress up, we're talking about reading a book. Being on the wrong end of genocide, doesn't excuse bigotry. Denying education, that's exactly the problem. Equal rights to a minority, well the minority groups are denied the right to read them. Very smart take, it was despite your weak attempt to change its meaning. Basically you just spent all your time trying to say minorities can't be bigots.", "And the person I was responding to was talking about Muslims, you keep up.", "Reading a text also doesn't affect her. It's easily accessible to the public. It's not a closely guarded Jewish secret. Not like he broke into a synagogue or impersonated a Rabbi to get it. He just read some text. No harm was caused to her.\n\nAlso, the OP states that she \"found out\" it doesn't say how. I agree if he read it was like \"Just thought I'd let you know, I read that text you that you're advised not to and the warnings are bogus - I'm not insane\" yeah, that's an AH move. But if she just found it on the computer or a friend told her, then no, NTA. No obligation to let a partner's religion rule your life.
