I can\u2019t seem to find info regarding this", "So here's the thing. Kabbalah is what's known as a closed practice. Some cultures have certain dances or songs that are reserved for certain types of people. Some have certain rituals that are secret or reserved for members. One example is that Catholic tradition reserves Communion for people who are baptized and have given confession. You're not supposed to just walk in off the street and interact with the body and blood of Christ. When people violate these practices by engaging in them when they aren't part of the permitted group, it's a form of appropriation.\n\nKabbalah is traditionally restricted to educated men with families (and I think usually they also have to be rabbis) because it's hard-core mysticism, and people who engage in mysticism without some kind of grounding can have problems. I don't mean like Lovecraft \"oooh he read an ancient book and now he's CRAAAZZZY,\" but go read some accounts of mystics. Mysticism changes a person's relationship with the world and themselves. In Jewish tradition, restricting it is a way to avoid the kind of mystic practice that separates someone from the community so hard that they sit on top of a pole until their feet rot off (Daniel the Stylite--seriously, some of the late antique and medieval Christian mystics dialed it up to 11).\n\nAnd as mysticism, it gets into stuff that's incredibly important to Jewish thought, practice, and history. In that context, it isn't just a fun book to read because you're curious. A lot of Jews treat it incredibly reverentially.\n\nAnd yes, I know that Kabbalah was appropriated by non-Jews a LONG time ago and so it's pretty easy to find the texts in English. So you're hardly the first goy to read them and you're not super likely to go hide in a cave somewhere praying until you starve.\n\nBUT what happened was your girlfriend told you that something was sacred to her. Maybe not in the most eloquent or clear way, but she did. And instead of honoring and finding out more about its importance TO HER, you took it as a challenge and, in her perspective, violated its sacredness.\n\nSo I'm not going to judge because I think you two miscommunicated, both as individuals and culturally, but I hope learning some context helps you understand why she's upset.", "I'm going with YTA\n\nI am not a religious person, but I do respect others' beliefs. She tells you a part of her religion that's a taboo to do before a certain age and you do it anyway. That shows a fairly significant amount of disrespect towards her faith. Is it silly? Yes imo, but that's just how people are with religion. It's something incredibly personal to them and if you cross boundaries they set on purpose, YTA.", " I've read through various Kabbalistic texts, Qabbalistic (Christianized versions), Golden Dawn style ceremonial magick, AND Enochian texts. And Oh The Horror, I was a 25-30 year old female at the time. There are a lot of interesting concepts and stories. I enjoyed what I learned immensely and ceremonial magick still flavors my spiritual practices to this day even though I lean more Heathen.\n\nPersonally, I see absolutely nothing wrong with curiosity. That's what drove me. I was looking for something to believe in after the typical hypocritical southern Christian childhood.

If he told me I can't read some part of the Qur'an because I'm too young or whatever, I wouldn't because :\n1) like I said I'm not religious so it just doesn't interest me that much \n2) I want him to feel loved and respected in our relationship and if this tradition is important to him then so be it \ud83d\udc81\n\nIt just sounds like you're a bit of a contrarian and decided to read the text in question simply because you were asked not to.

U disrespected her beliefs balantly and almost immediately with no regard to her.", "Are you really this mentally daft?\nIt\u2019s important to her and she\u2019s expressed this, so you decided to ignore her feelings and religion and then flaunt this to her.", "Because if you care about someone then you don't go out of your way to do something to upset them?", "Ha!", "Perhaps. That is the biggest roadblock I see to a potential future, really.", "I\u2019m from the culture tantra is from and I don\u2019t find that nauseating", "I should preface this by saying I\u2019m not knowledgeable, but compared to the average person, I at least know enough to (mostly) know what I don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cTraditional\u201d can mean different things in different spots/communities. In some areas/from some people, I\u2019d take it as \u201cfully secular, but enjoy specific rituals/holidays and do those ones close to how my family did it\u201d, but in other contexts I\u2019d hear it and assume orthoprax, which is some assemblage of orthodox actions, but what assemblage/degree could be anywhere on the scale.\n\nIt would most usually be paired with a qualifier now I\u2019ve encountered it. Like \u201cI\u2019m not religious, but I am traditional\u201d == holidays, maybe family focus on weekend meals, maybe some candles, but it also could mean Reform/Conservative expressing they\u2019re on the more observant side, I\u2019ve just generally experienced R/C to say which they are plus the word traditional.\n\nBasically, I\u2019m not really helpful because it can mean so many things, but really also is influenced by the vibe of the person.", "As far as I know traditionalism falls between orthodox and conservative on the spectrum, agreeing with conservatives that the halakha is binding, but also subject to historical development. However, they disagreed with specific sociopolitical choices made by the conservative movement (which is a fairly progressive movement sociopolitically) sometime around the 80s (I'm not sure exactly when), especially on the matter of ordaining female rabbits.", "Oh yes, her rabbi hates me, which I find very amusing", ">only 40+ men can read or will go insane to be a weird and cultist belief....\n\nThis isn't what they believe.

I said u have to respect them. Respecting her beliefs and following them are 2 different things. It's like u choosing to not understand", "dude, she's your girlfriend.  If you can't do something as simple as not reading a religious text you're not supposed to read out of respect--at least respect for*her*, if not for the religion itself, yta.", "Cool. So you\u2019re admitting that her beliefs aren\u2019t important to you. \nIf you actually cared about your girlfriend, you would care and respect her religion. \n\nIt blows my mind you aren\u2019t understanding this and if you\u2019re this much of an asshole in general, how anyone decided to date you.", "Lol, because not doing this small thing is catering to their every whim.

Your lack of respect for your gf is.", "I was just informing you that either this is made up or overly dramatized.", "No, because respecting the text would be not reading it.

She told u it was important to her and how she felt and u immediately did the thing u knew would upset her.", "I can see why the Rabbi dislikes you.", "Maybe you need to learn to respect yourself more too then.  People close to you should find what you believe in important, and vice versa.", "She isn't imposing anything on you. She isn't forcing you to behave in any certain way. She is asking you to show respect to her religion by literally not going out of your way to disrespect. The other guy is right, what an edgelord. I doubt you will be together much longer.", "Okay, so theoretically, how would I be respectful about it without following it?", "It\u2019s probably for the best since I don\u2019t foresee the relationship going anywhere. As for not imposing anything on me, telling me what I can and can\u2019t do is a textbook imposition"]}
