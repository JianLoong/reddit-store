Could be stylistic tastes, garbage art, you just don't have room for it, you don't feel like having a painting in your car on vacation, etc. Literally, the reasons you could have said that you wouldn't buy it are almost endless, and most of them don't even say anything about the art itself or the artist. He chose to take it as an insult and insulted you. That's solely on him. Could you have had that discussion off camera? Sure. But frankly, if an artist can't take hearing that one person wouldn't be interested in buying their art on a given day for an unspecified reason, they're very much in the wrong business.", "NTA you didnt do anything wrong i really dont understand the yta voters", "NTA. This is basic economics of supply and demand. Everyone has different values for stuff. A Taylor Swift fan might be willing to spend hundreds of dollars on tickets. But for someone who\u2019s not a Swiftie, I wouldn\u2019t spend more than a hundred bucks. that isn\u2019t a judgement about the value of Taylor Swift. That\u2019s just me saying it\u2019s not my taste and so I wouldn\u2019t be willing to spend that much on it. \n\nI think OP made it pretty clear saying that she\u2019s not saying it isn\u2019t worth $100. It\u2019s just not worth $100 to her. The seller just took it way too personally.", "YTA\n\nYou asked the price, and then insulted him\n\nYou're the reason for the \"asshole tax\"", "NTA\n\nThe title was misleading and possibly click-bait. If you had told him \"Your painting isn't worth 100 dollars\" that would have been rude and needlessly cruel, so AH.\n\nWhat actually happened was your husband was interested, he asked your opinion in front of the artist, you said you didn't want the art, the artist responded very aggressively and you responded less aggressively.\n\nI truly do not get the people calling you an AH. Literally the only possible thing you could have done to not upset the artist is lie to your husband and spend money you didn't want to spend, and I do not believe that you are required to lie to your husband and buy something you don't want just because there is a seller out there who might take it very personally that not everyone wants to buy his art at the price he want to sell.\n\nIf the AH judgements are because you responded to his aggression with something less than perfect politeness, what you said wasn't even rude.", "NTA. If you said it as written, it\u2019s about as polite as you could have been when faced with a pushy and rude art vendor.", "NTA.\n\nI fail to see what OP even arguably did wrong here. Husband put her on the spot. She answered honestly, and not rudely. Didn't say she didn't like it. Didn't say it sucked. Just said she wouldn't buy it. Not even dissuading husband if he wanted to.\n\nIn response she gets called a bitch by random street seller - and still remains VERY civil. Much more so than most, I would think.\n\nBTW - Husband is a complete AH for not defending OP here. If the exact same thing happened to my wife in that circumstance, the vendor would be minus his teeth.", "Oh FFS people. It's a street vendor. \"How much?\" \"$100.\" \"Do you want it?\" \"No.\" That's ALL that happened. Nobody was insulted until the artist supposedly called her a bitch, which admittedly I find REALLY hard to believe. \n\nOP doesn't have to make excuses or talk to her husband privately to tell him not to buy it. I guarantee you the vendor - who has hundreds if not thousands of people walking by every day - wasn't insulted. And I guarantee you ANYBODY could get the $100 - he wasn't doing any special pricing. \n\nPeople need to get out in the real world more if they think OP did anything offensive.", "NTA.

Not at all.", "NTA, if he was in galleries he would not be selling on a corner.  All you said is that you would not buy it and he called you a b--ch.  He needs to grow thicker skin and watch his mouth.  Who overheard what he told you.
