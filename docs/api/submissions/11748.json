I (33f) have two kids (6m/8m) with my ex husband \u201cDave\u201d (34m).  He has another child with another woman. So he asked me to lower child support since I have a boyfriend who I\u2019ve been with for about a year.  Dave claims that my boyfriend \u201cEric\u201d should be financially responsible for my kids. His argument is that Eric is in the military and doesn\u2019t live with HIS son so any money Eric gives to his kid should really go to mine. I\u2019m like\u2026NO!!??? That\u2019s now how parenting works. Eric\u2019s ability to be financially responsible for his son does not make him responsible for Dave\u2019s kids. \n\nI do work and primarily support my kid\u2019s, but recently 9M needed dental work. Dave REFUSED to pay half and only told me about it when the procedure was complete, despite telling me he could pay half.  I pointed out that our divorce decree states he\u2019s responsible for 75% of the cost of medical and dental care due to his extremely low child support. He keeps telling me to get Eric to pay for our kids and to cut his child support. Dave is saying that it\u2019s expensive to have a baby and his girlfriend will be on maternity so she won\u2019t be making money. Meanwhile, Eric is a second stream of income for me. I\u2019m firm that Eric is not responsible for our kids atm. \n\nDave has now told me that I\u2019m clearly jealous because he\u2019s a successful partner since he and his girlfriend are new parents. They\u2019re both calling me a money grubbing AH because I refuse to lower the child support so they can support their baby\u2019s needs. I just told them that Eric isn\u2019t responsible for Dave\u2019s children until Eric decides he wants to be. The fact that Eric and I are moving slow in our relationship.  We are currently having my kids spend more time with him, but I don\u2019t see Eric as a second stream of income, he\u2019s my partner. He pays for me and takes care of me, and my kids are slowly becoming a part of that.

I think this might go to court because he keeps saying his baby needs it more. I would hate to take it there because of my kids, but Dave should be financially responsible for them. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not crazy for thinking Dave should still pay his CS.", "Taking notes here", "That\u2019s what I think I\u2019m gonna do is tell him tot ale me to court to lower the payment if he really feels justified. I think the confidence and certainty he and his girlfriend displayed are what made me feel like I was selfish. Thank you.", "This might be where it goes because Dave says his new baby needs the money more.", "I thought so too. It\u2019s good to hear that other people agree. I felt bad though because of the baby, but I also thought that if he can\u2019t afford a third, he should have had a third.", "It\u2019s probably going to go to court. I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s wrong with him, but there\u2019s definitely a lot. I think what threw me is the girlfriend backing him up on lowering child support. It makes me wonder though if they would have asked, regardless of me having a partner.", "I had a lawyer go over the child support with me, but he ignored the entire divorce process except when the lawyer basically strong armed him into it. I know exactly where I could take it but I do wonder what will happen to my kid\u2019s relationship with their dad. That\u2019s all I worry about you know?", "It\u2019s definitely in writing. Our decree has been active since 2021 and this was the first time something big has happened with one of our kids. It wasn\u2019t an optional procedure, but a necessary one. Going to court is what might have to happen for multiple reasons, especially because I do refuse to stand down on lowering CS.", "I didn\u2019t want to get lawyers involved because the mess that was my divorce was difficult for my kids. They still see their dad frequently due to the decree giving him visitation rights, which I don\u2019t mind because my kids love their dad. However, I am starting to think I need to just do what\u2019s best for my kids financially and be emotionally prepared for the worst at this point.", "Everyone says a judge would laugh\u2026Like Judge Judy?", "My kids love their dad so they see him a lot actually. Normally things are fine. But for some reason the money is a huge deal. He\u2019s not broke or anything, he works a good job and if he budgets like I do, the children are very affordable. Someone else gave me a horrible notion that he is planning to \u201cmove on\u201d from the kids though and I hope that doesn\u2019t happen.", "I plan on being stubborn. Eric has no idea this is happening to this degree. He was amused when I said Dave thinks he should be financially responsible, but I stopped it there because he\u2019d be furious to know Dave feels that entitled.", "Eric and I are not living together, but we are slowly working towards that goal. He\u2019s patient and understands why I\u2019m moving this way. I do plan on changing his support when the time comes, but since it\u2019s already super low, I doubt Eric\u2019s income is really going to affect it.", "That wouldn\u2019t make sense in this situation.

And once that attorney has handed your ex his ass for this BS of \"Tell your boyfriend to support my kids and no I won't pay what I owe because I have a new baby\", your being able to ask if you need to call said attorney again the next time your ex sticks his head up his backend may well cut down on nonsense going forward.  I really do wonder what rock your ex crawled out from under.  Good luck!", "Whether or not your kids needs are met they may want to go to college or trade school.

What a block head.", "Exactly. It\u2019s ok to sympathize because he chose to have another child without thinking about his finances. Cause the baby didn\u2019t do anything wrong.

If it bothers him that much then he needs to 100% put in the effort to change it.", "You are not crazy and you sound like an awesome co-parent. Dave should be thankful instead of trying to short change your kids. Because to be clear- it's not you he is screwing it's his own children. Good luck OP!", "I am sure it is really hard to face. Of course you don\u2019t want your kids to go through that, but also not being able to fathom treating your kids that way. I know I can\u2019t imagine treating my kids that way. If he does as I suspect, I recommend therapy for your kids. Hopefully it will help them process their feelings.", "Your state probably has a standard child support calculator.

If he doesn\u2019t involve the kids in anything and they don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, it\u2019s gonna be one of those things that you gotta deal with yourself. And I would just completely ignore him.", "I understand your worry, but regardless of what you do it\u2019s still up to Dave how little he does for his kids. Because if Dave is petty enough to reduce or stop seeing his kids because he\u2019s mad about child support than he\u2019s probably going to do that anyway. If his attitude is his new family needs his entire income, they\u2019re probably going to need all his free time too. If he\u2019s going to feel like he has zero requirement to be a father then he\u2019s going to do act that way. It is just how some people are.

They are missing out because of it.  Take him to court get what is owed and have his payments increased to the reasonable amount. Maybe request a court ordered and approved co parenting app, it can make thjngs easier with enforcement. Stop engaging with him about nonsense. You do  ot need to respond to bizarre comments.

Or Dave's GF's income, for the matter.\n\nWhat counts is Dave's income (and I think his expenses are not taken in consideration the way he thinks they are). That's why there are known cases of deadbeat dads who take a lower pay job so they can petition for a lower CS.\n\nDon't let Dave manipulate you into reduced CS if you eventually marry Eric, either.
