I (33f) have two kids (6m/8m) with my ex husband \u201cDave\u201d (34m).  He has another child with another woman. So he asked me to lower child support since I have a boyfriend who I\u2019ve been with for about a year.  Dave claims that my boyfriend \u201cEric\u201d should be financially responsible for my kids. His argument is that Eric is in the military and doesn\u2019t live with HIS son so any money Eric gives to his kid should really go to mine. I\u2019m like\u2026NO!!??? That\u2019s now how parenting works. Eric\u2019s ability to be financially responsible for his son does not make him responsible for Dave\u2019s kids. \n\nI do work and primarily support my kid\u2019s, but recently 9M needed dental work. Dave REFUSED to pay half and only told me about it when the procedure was complete, despite telling me he could pay half.  I pointed out that our divorce decree states he\u2019s responsible for 75% of the cost of medical and dental care due to his extremely low child support. He keeps telling me to get Eric to pay for our kids and to cut his child support. Dave is saying that it\u2019s expensive to have a baby and his girlfriend will be on maternity so she won\u2019t be making money. Meanwhile, Eric is a second stream of income for me. I\u2019m firm that Eric is not responsible for our kids atm. \n\nDave has now told me that I\u2019m clearly jealous because he\u2019s a successful partner since he and his girlfriend are new parents. They\u2019re both calling me a money grubbing AH because I refuse to lower the child support so they can support their baby\u2019s needs. I just told them that Eric isn\u2019t responsible for Dave\u2019s children until Eric decides he wants to be. The fact that Eric and I are moving slow in our relationship.  We are currently having my kids spend more time with him, but I don\u2019t see Eric as a second stream of income, he\u2019s my partner. He pays for me and takes care of me, and my kids are slowly becoming a part of that.

I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not crazy for thinking Dave should still pay his CS.", "Taking notes here", "That\u2019s what I think I\u2019m gonna do is tell him tot ale me to court to lower the payment if he really feels justified. I think the confidence and certainty he and his girlfriend displayed are what made me feel like I was selfish. Thank you.", "This might be where it goes because Dave says his new baby needs the money more.", "I thought so too. It\u2019s good to hear that other people agree. I felt bad though because of the baby, but I also thought that if he can\u2019t afford a third, he should have had a third.", "It\u2019s probably going to go to court. I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s wrong with him, but there\u2019s definitely a lot. I think what threw me is the girlfriend backing him up on lowering child support. It makes me wonder though if they would have asked, regardless of me having a partner.", "I had a lawyer go over the child support with me, but he ignored the entire divorce process except when the lawyer basically strong armed him into it. I know exactly where I could take it but I do wonder what will happen to my kid\u2019s relationship with their dad. That\u2019s all I worry about you know?", "It\u2019s definitely in writing. Our decree has been active since 2021 and this was the first time something big has happened with one of our kids. It wasn\u2019t an optional procedure, but a necessary one. Going to court is what might have to happen for multiple reasons, especially because I do refuse to stand down on lowering CS.", "I didn\u2019t want to get lawyers involved because the mess that was my divorce was difficult for my kids. They still see their dad frequently due to the decree giving him visitation rights, which I don\u2019t mind because my kids love their dad. However, I am starting to think I need to just do what\u2019s best for my kids financially and be emotionally prepared for the worst at this point.", "Everyone says a judge would laugh\u2026Like Judge Judy?", "My kids love their dad so they see him a lot actually. Normally things are fine. But for some reason the money is a huge deal. He\u2019s not broke or anything, he works a good job and if he budgets like I do, the children are very affordable. Someone else gave me a horrible notion that he is planning to \u201cmove on\u201d from the kids though and I hope that doesn\u2019t happen.", "I plan on being stubborn. Eric has no idea this is happening to this degree. He was amused when I said Dave thinks he should be financially responsible, but I stopped it there because he\u2019d be furious to know Dave feels that entitled.", "Eric and I are not living together, but we are slowly working towards that goal. He\u2019s patient and understands why I\u2019m moving this way. I do plan on changing his support when the time comes, but since it\u2019s already super low, I doubt Eric\u2019s income is really going to affect it.", "That wouldn\u2019t make sense in this situation. She doesn\u2019t pay child support. Her ex does so by your statement, I\u2019d this was in your state, he\u2019d had to pay more if SHE had another kid with someone else.", "You should retain a lawyer because they will give you tips for managing the co-parenting with that shi%#y ex of yours. The lawyers have seen the levels people can stoop down to and will stop you from falling victim to the same c#*p your ex may pull.", "NTA - and you absolutely need to get an attorney.  And once that attorney has handed your ex his ass for this BS of \"Tell your boyfriend to support my kids and no I won't pay what I owe because I have a new baby\", your being able to ask if you need to call said attorney again the next time your ex sticks his head up his backend may well cut down on nonsense going forward.  I really do wonder what rock your ex crawled out from under.  Good luck!", "Whether or not your kids needs are met they may want to go to college or trade school. Get that child support and bank it to give them a headstart in life or for unexpected emergencies. Do not short change your kids. Definitely NTA.", "People do not get to \u201cmove on\u201d from their own children! Yeash!", "Eric has zero responsibility for your kids. You have only been together for a year, so it's not like he is suddenly taking in the kids.\n\nEven if this was 10 years down the road and you two get married, Dave is still financially responsible for the kids he made with you. He doesn't get to cut financial ties just because you found a relationship with someone else.\n\nStand your ground. Dave needs to take responsibility. He can't focus all his energy on his upcoming kid.", "I paid for the lawyer when we divorced so I can go back to that one. It\u2019s a pain to go through it but also worth it since this is something that\u2019s been going on for awhile.", "The reason for getting a court order is that if your ex makes your kids suffer (financially), he\u2019ll be penalized enough to learn a lesson.\n\nYour situation is not unique. Your ex is simply trying to weasel out of paying his share of child support and is using every excuse in the book of an a%#. You might want to only contact him through text or emails so that there is evidence of each interaction you have with him. Please discuss this with your lawyer.\n\nYou are NTA for expecting a father to be responsible for the children he helped to create.", "You aren\u2019t crazy, what\u2019s crazy is your ex thinking that just because some other guy is in your and your child life that means his financial responsibility is diminished. What a block head.", "Exactly. It\u2019s ok to sympathize because he chose to have another child without thinking about his finances. Cause the baby didn\u2019t do anything wrong. But like, he has three kids, not one. He has to be responsible for that and trying to make it your problem is pathetic. I wish you the best! Good job sticking up for your kids. Definitely NTA.", "I would look into using one of the apps designed for communication between coparents so that the conversations are limited and on the record if need be. You absolutely do not need to be listening to his nonsense. Either he pays according to the agreement on record or it goes to the court.", "What a deadbeat! First, go to court if you have text messages showing him saying all this to be sure you get your money. Keep copies of everything. You can also ask the court to help with communication so you don't have to deal with him. \n\nAnd what kind of woman is she??? I would have left my husband if he tried to pull that kinda bullshit on his ex. Don't get me wrong its been tough but those are his kids. I wouldn't imagine asking him to cut them off for me or our son", "Wow \u201cIt\u2019s for the baby.\u201d But the older (much more expensive, might I add) already existing children are supposed to go without to make that happen? Your ex and the new GF are just selfish. They likely didn\u2019t consider how expensive it would be to have a child, and are trying to manipulate you into lowering this cost so they don\u2019t have to take responsibility and either 1.) budget their current income better to accommodate, or 2.) increase their income. While his existing children are still his responsibility, his new children are NOT your responsibility. I stand by my judgement.", "I just wouldn\u2019t entertain anything he says. Our court agreements says XYZ and that\u2019s what we\u2019re sticking to. Don\u2019t respond to his nonsense.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t even put the idea of going to court in his head. If it bothers him that much then he needs to 100% put in the effort to change it.", "You are not crazy and you sound like an awesome co-parent. Dave should be thankful instead of trying to short change your kids. Because to be clear- it's not you he is screwing it's his own children. Good luck OP!", "I am sure it is really hard to face. Of course you don\u2019t want your kids to go through that, but also not being able to fathom treating your kids that way. I know I can\u2019t imagine treating my kids that way. If he does as I suspect, I recommend therapy for your kids. Hopefully it will help them process their feelings.", "Your state probably has a standard child support calculator. Run the numbers.", "They would have asked you anyway. Only their reasoning would have been different - \u201cyou only need to take care of your expenses and a little more for the kids. We need to pay our expenses plus child support\u201d \ud83d\ude44. ( child support isn\u2019t a surprise expense for them, they knew it would be ongoing for some years down the line)", "Sadly I\u2019m not surprised, it\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve heard the new mother tell the dad to stop paying for his previous kids.", "If he involves the kids into the drama, I would request a hearing to call him out for parental alienation and demand family counseling for all of the kids with you and your ex involved. If he doesn\u2019t involve the kids in anything and they don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, it\u2019s gonna be one of those things that you gotta deal with yourself. And I would just completely ignore him.", "I understand your worry, but regardless of what you do it\u2019s still up to Dave how little he does for his kids. Because if Dave is petty enough to reduce or stop seeing his kids because he\u2019s mad about child support than he\u2019s probably going to do that anyway. If his attitude is his new family needs his entire income, they\u2019re probably going to need all his free time too. If he\u2019s going to feel like he has zero requirement to be a father then he\u2019s going to do act that way. It is just how some people are. (One of my very good friends has a dad that\u2019s on his 4th family, ignoring his previous kids. Some people are just this way.)", "Laughter would be the kindest reaction he would get. Most would verbally eviscerate him and then they\u2019d get mean.", "Ok then no worries. But you can see how having unreported income could make things unfair for one party or the other.", "True.", "This! I will never understand anybody wanting to be with a partner that does not want to support their own children. Taking care of the children you bring into this world is not conditional on whether or not you are still with their mother or father.", "I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s going through their heads but it\u2019s really just money they seem to have a problem with. Usually they\u2019re cool seeing the kids and all that. But it\u2019s like\u2026they want me to be 99.9% financially responsible. We both moved on from our marriage but I agree that the children are very deserving of being loved and taken care of.", "Hopefully it won\u2019t take too long too many billable hours to convince him you\u2019re not messing around. Good luck.", "This is the first I am hearing of a coparenting app! I\u2019m definitely going to look into that!  Thank you!", "It\u2019s been hard but yes, I\u2019m keeping the texts between us. I\u2019ve already told him all communication should go through texts, but someone shared an app I can use so I think I\u2019ll try that instead. \n\nShe\u2019s there type who doesn\u2019t talk to me at all so I can\u2019t tell you what she\u2019s like. My kids are ok with her though. I can see where she\u2019s coming from if she believes I\u2019m the bad guy because I\u2019m frustrated dealing with Dave\u2019s nonsense. I also think she doesn\u2019t know what his CS is.", "Thank you I appreciate your view.", "Thank you for this plan of action here. I wouldn\u2019t know what to do if he brought my kids into the situation. During the divorce he made up stories about what happened but my oldest remembers. Usually I do ignore him, but this whole thing is just wild.", "Thank you for this insight. I actually value it because I need to keep in mind this new circumstance that has developed. I\u2019ll be more firm. Thank you!", "Of course! If the roles were reversed I\u2019d hope the other part would be fair to me you know?", "That\u2019s nuts. Also, like\u2026that makes no sense. I\u2019ll let him know he should be grateful he doesn\u2019t live in that state wherever that is lol", "You are so welcome! I hope it helps!", "Got it. Just keep records as best you can. I can't tell you how many times that helped my husband when he had issues with his ex. Hopefully he'll wake up and realize its on him to take care of all his kids not just the ones who live with him full time."]}
