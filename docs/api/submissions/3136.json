Look! Shiny thing!\n\nI dated a guy who handled this *perfectly*. He bought tickets for us to a concert that was really important to him. The night before, he told me, \u201cI will be leaving at 5pm. I\u2019d like to go with you, but if you aren\u2019t ready then I will leave your ticket here in the counter and will see you there.\u201d\n\nSee how perfect that is?\n\nGave a deadline: will leave at 5pm.\n\nDetached my possible lateness from affecting him: he will go whether I am ready or not, so that he isn\u2019t stressed or misses anything.\n\nDetached responsibility for my being on time: if I wanted to be ready for 5pm, I had to plan for it and follow through myself.  (This is one trap partners often all into: enabling by trying to take control/responsibility for the behavior themselves. I note OP mentions \u201casking her to wake up and get ready\u201d for an hour \u2014 that\u2019s not his job to enforce.)\n\n*Did not guilt me*: the unspoken subtext is my tendency to be late. He knew, and I knew, and saying it would only make me feel guilt piled on top of my normal guilt, add anxiety, could spiral, and becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. So, he simply stated deadline and his plans \u2014 what was in his control \u2014 and let me decide how to handle my responsibility.\n\nAllowed for my failure (again, with no shaming and no punishment, like \u201cthen you\u2019re not going!\u201d): Simply, I\u2019ll leave your ticket and will see you there. \n\nExpressed interest in my being on time and implied hope that I would, with the reward of being together longer if so: \u201cI would like to go with you\u201d. \n\n*Perfect* handling. And yes I made a big effort and was on time, and we went together.\n\nWorks just as well on people who aren\u2019t ADHD \u2014 if OP\u2019s partner was lazy, hungover, or avoiding his family without trying to say so, this has just the same effect of making her responsible for her own plans and behavior and detaching the effect of her failure from his plans (except for her potential anger for not being catered to, which suggests not ADHD since that usually comes with a heaping helping of internalized shame).\n\nWhere OP fell through (but not an AH for it, just didn\u2019t handle well): not setting a specific deadline in advance to allow her to make her own plans, and taking responsibility to try to get her awake and moving. \u201cI will be leaving at 10am for my family\u2019s place. If that\u2019s going to be too early for you I can get you an Uber to follow along\u201d (or, \u201cI\u2019ll take an Uber and we\u2019ll ride back together\u201d).\n\nMaybe there\u2019s other factors at play. Was she doing all the travel work \u2014 laundry, packing, driving, and was exhausted? Telling her the deadline in advance gives her the opportunity to say, \u201cWe got in and went to sleep at 2am after I\u2019ve been handling everything getting ready, I\u2019ll need more sleep than that. I\u2019ll take the Uber.\u201d And next time you know to do more of the prep work so you\u2019ll both be better balanced for readiness. Keyword is talking it out in advance.", "NTA.  She knew when you wanted to leave and didn't get ready in time.", "NTA\n\nMy Gran taught me \"Punctuality is the height of respect.  Tardiness is the height of conceit.\"  I would guess your fiancee thinks her time is more valuable than anyone else's is or has ever been.", "NTA. Taking this post at face value ... if she can't get out of bed by the crack of noon for a family event that's important to you, and she can't understand why you're unhappy about it, the time may be here to reassess.", "Nta. I hope you left her in the room", "NTA. You were willing to compromise by getting her an Uber so she could get ready at her own pace, even though she knew the itinerary.", "NTA No shame in catching an Uber. If your gf doesn\u2019t want to spend so much time with your family\u2026 an Uber is the perfect excuse for her to hang around the hotel without you bugging her to leave.", "I\u2019m cringing just reading this. How disrespectful to you & your family. You should get a new gf.", "NTA I would be livid she wasn\u2019t on time and didn\u2019t seem to give a shit about it", "My daughter used to pull this stunt. It was pure anx. Maybe she has issues you're not aware of. But that means this INFO/ESH", "Agreed and I am that slow to wake GF/Wife. But my husband and I have come to an agreement that on occasion I have to drive myself or take an Uber to events. It\u2019s my own damn fault and I can\u2019t be mad at him for it.", "Are you me? I just want to make sure. Because nobody has seen us in the same place at the same time, so it's possible.", "> I do this crazy thing called waking up early to make sure I have time.\n\nI wish my sister would learn this trick...", "Well she is a princess and she is exhausting so \u2026.", "INFO: how do you spend two hours in the bathtub? I would really like to know, please.", "Your GF sounds like a lot and not in a good way at all because I used to do a red eye from West Coast to East Coast (visit family), I typically got in at 6AM took a short nap and I was off seeing friends and family because that is what you do.  Just think this is how your life is going to be for the next 50-60 years, sounds awesome\u2026", "Lilu Dallas ,multipass.", "Running joke in my family is that everyone is always late for holiday gatherings so to tell aunts and uncles to show up hours earlier than actually wanted. My siblings and I have definitely gone the opposite way and show up on time for things.", "Not OC but I occasionally spend a few hours in the tub - a hot soak is amazing at soothing sore muscles. I throw on an audiobook to listen to so I don't get bored and sip a drink (chilled white wine is perfect, whisky will make you feel too flushed) while I relax and listen to the book.\n\nYou should try it! You can even throw some Epson salts in the bath and add some candles around it for ambiance if you're feeling fancy.", "(for today only)  Turkey, gooood!", "Lol...crazy man, just crazy", "...we've done that to my sister before lol\n\nA friend had a party and she told her 30 minutes earlier than the rest of us XD", "hey if it works, it works lol", "NTA. I'm a late riser too and don't expect my partner to wait around for me. She's been a brat.", "NTA. 100%. \n\nTo be fair, being late to anything is a trigger of mine, but I agree with others who say the level she\u2019s taking it to is just disrespectful. Sleep is important. Healthy family time is important. A balance can certainly be found. You offering an Uber is a thoughtful gesture. \n\nSounds like you started trying to rouse her around 10? That would have given her a good amount of time to get around. If you had not tried to wake her at all and just disappeared, then I\u2019d say you were the asshole.", "My dad hated that my mom was always late. But he only dressed himself. She had to dress herself and me. I was a toddler at the time. She had to bring drinks, lock all the doors, ect. She told him he could help out and they'd be on time for things. But he refused so we were always late.", "NTA\n\nShe knew she had to get up and I assume is an adult who knows how long it takes her to get ready and can set an alarm. Heck, I have a Chronic Fatigue condition and I manage it, so what's her excuse? Going ahead is perfectly fine, it doesn't mean you don't love her, it just means you respect your family's plans.", "NTA.\n\nI've been abused this way. Deliberate delays are a power play in toxic relationships where the delayer tries to prove that if they aren't obeyed and appeased, they'll disrupt your schedule and disrespect your time. And, in this case, it looks like she's trying to keep you from seeing your family--has she tried to interfere with your family time in any other ways?\n\nI'm sure I sound suspicious, but think about it. If it really -was- about her wanting to relax more, she would have been happy at the Uber suggestion. But she got upset at the possibility of you being able to keep your own schedule and to see your family on your own time.\n\nYou might be in an abusive relationship, dude.", "NTA except if you waste your money on a Uber for her.", "NTA.\n\n You offered an alternative way for her to arrive. You want to spend time with your family and help with the festivities. She isn't being considerate of you or your family's time.\n\nAlso maybe it will teach her to get ready on time like you suggested. I did this to multiple people in college. They weren't ready by a certain time, they could find their own ride. They learned to respect my time and either got ready real fast or brought everything in the car and got ready there.", "NTA Quite the headache indeed.", "NTA. I can\u2019t stand ppl that waste my time like that", "She's not hyped about helping to cook maybe", "NTA. She's the AH.", "NTA\n\nI have a rule that I only wake up early for breakfast or vacation. But ya know what? It's a joke. Do I hate waking up on other's terms? Yes, but I do it because I'm a damn adult and I'm not selfish.", "Info: was this an East to west coast trip or a west to east coast trip? Because asking for an 11 am time when it\u2019s actually 2pm at home after a day of travel is 100% acceptable. But asking for an 11am leave time when it\u2019s actually 7am back home after a day of travel is a very different thing.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nHow disrespectful of you and your families time", "How old are you parents? 60? They live to be 80 and you see them twice a year for the next 20 years means you\u2019ll only see your parents 40 more times in your life. NTA.", "NTA. Seems a reasonable solution to me. Though you could have taken the Uber.", "NTA. It's incredibly rude to be late especially when your family has already started cooking. Your gf's attitude is awful. She owes you and your family an apology.", "Seriously. \n\nIf left to my own devices I'd wake up at like 1pm-2pm, at some point you have to sort it out...I have like 10+ alarms on my phone to wake me up.\n\n08:00am, 08:05am, 08:10am etc. \n\nNow the days feel so much longer and I have more free time, and oversleeping now puts me in a bad mood rather than just being the norm lol.", "Why should she be the one getting up with the kids in the morning?  Something wrong with him?", "If she really -were- exhausted, wouldn't she have taken the offer to sleep in and take an Uber later? She fought it angrily and tried to keep OP from seeing his family--how does her exhaustion mean he has to be kept from his family?", "It's the people with the excuses who try the hardest  not to use them I find. Chronic Fatigue here. I make sure to rest the day before important events and set like a million alarms. It's understandable that people have crashes on the day but since OP doesn't mention anything like that she doesn't have a leg to stand on! x", "I\u2019m a slow starter if I have to get up before my normal time. By all means, go, and I\u2019ll get an uber myself later, and pay for it myself. No reason other people should be penalized for something dumb like that because I\u2019m half sloth.", "My husband does this", "Agreed, he was considerate enough to get an uber and a decent timeline and still waited longer for her so I feel as though if she had issues preventing her from getting ready early enough that he would have helped her. That being said it is the internet so you never know whats true.", "The problem is after some time, the water get cold and it is not relaxing anymore.", "I add a small amount of super hot water to reheat the tub. It's pretty easy.", "I often take two hour long baths, and the rate at which the water cools is slow enough that it doesn't get uncomfortable. Plus you can always top it up with hot water if it really get super cold.", "yeah and wasteful", "I grew up in an apartment with communal hot water and a family of five could take long baths. \n\nThen I moved to Britain and it\u2019s hot water tanks where you drain it to fill the tub, and then it takes hours to reheat, so you can\u2019t top up, ever. \n\nThen I moved to a place with a shower and would love the previous arrangement back.", "Oh, fuck off with your judgemental bullshit.\n\nI already said I soak in the tub to help with sore muscles. Not being in pain is WAY more important than saving a tiny bit of water. \n\nBesides, I didn't have kids and don't commute far. I bet my lifestyle is overall less wasteful than yours or most other people's. Unless you also whine at people who chose to have children or travel to work?", "Less wasteful than a 2 hour shower.", "I am poor without kids, I seriously doubt it. But enjoy your wastful regular two hour bath.", "Who take a two hour shower???", "Perfect, you can use your childfree time to reflect on the many steps needed to become less of a judgemental asshole.", "Many, many people on Reddit, apparently \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
