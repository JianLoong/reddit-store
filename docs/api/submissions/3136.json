Yes she would get mad, but after a few times, it stopped (again, I did mention she was my ex-wife).", "NTA\n\nShe is. It's so rude and disrespectful to act as if your time is more valuable than everyone else's. If she were say 15-30 minutes late waking up that's one thing.

Her other choice was to GET OUT OF BED.\n\nYour partner seems very controlling.  Why would she want you to sit there and watch her sleep, shower, put on her clothes?

You shouldn\u2019t have to hold an adult\u2019s hand through the holidays. You gave her a timeline a head of time, and she chose to fuck around and do what she wants to do. She\u2019s also emotionally manipulating you with her gaslighting bullshit about you \u201cthreatening\u201d her.

Perhaps you could have handled it better by waking her up at 10am and confirming you need to leave by 11am to make sure she is ready. \n\nBut nope, you are definitely not an AH here. She should be more considerate and not make trouble for you.

After years of frustrations like this, I learned to give them time to do their thing and they learned to let me go early (aka on time) and come pick them up later. I highly recommend getting to this point with your spouse because it\u2019s made a huge reduction in frustration in our relationship.\n\nETA: If you can\u2019t get to this point, you may want to rethink your relationship because this situation, if it\u2019s habitual on her part, is unlikely to change.", "INFO: Did you inform her ahead of time that Thanksgiving means the whole day rather just the family dinner?", "NTA. BUT - when visiting partners families, the non-family partner needs private down time and a treat. It can be really overwhelming to go to another families' holiday. So many people. You have to remember the stories that are secrets and stories that are the family joke.\n\nBefore you go, you both need to go over what is going to happen. When it starts, when it ends, are there naps? Tons of booze? No booze?  Football? \n\nIf it were me, as a guest I don't understand why I need to be there for the cooking.
