Kids wake up at 5am screaming!", "NTA. Your solution solved both problems if you wanting to get there and get wanting to laze around some more. She has nothing to be upset about.", "It was also really frustrating, because she kept saying that I was threatening her with leaving if she wasn\u2019t ready in 10 minutes. When I said, precisely \u201cif you would like to relax more, I can get you an Uber, when you are ready\u201d. I am not sure how this sentence can be heard in such a passive aggressive way.", "NTA. Her decision to not wake up and take her sweet ass time does not mean you have to miss out on family time.", "NTA You are far kinder than I am. My ex-wife used to pull this stunt on me all the time. Towards the end (I did mention she was my ex-wife,didn't I?) I gave her a deadline, if she wasn't ready, I would leave without her. Yes she would get mad, but after a few times, it stopped (again, I did mention she was my ex-wife).", "NTA\n\nShe is. It's so rude and disrespectful to act as if your time is more valuable than everyone else's. If she were say 15-30 minutes late waking up that's one thing. But, not up and getting ready an hour and half later? That's just shit manners. If she's upset, then good. Now she knows how you feel.", "**NTA**\n\nYou weren't asking her to be up at some ungodly hour in the morning, it was already almost noon. And in fact, you weren't asking her to be ready to go with you at all if she really didn't want to be hurried. You were letting her know that you were willing to accommodate her, but that you would like her to be considerate of YOUR feelings, because at that point the morning was already pretty much over, and you were still waiting to leave for your parents' house, whom you rarely get to see.\n\nAs you said, she hadn't been deprived of sleep, and you weren't rushing her. You were offering her a thoughtful alternative. \n\nShe was deeply selfish and inconsiderate, and you are most definitely NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou traveled to spend time with your family, and that time is limited. Your GF isn't making much of an effort to help you do that. If she cared more, I think she could've easily been ready by 11. It's not like you asked her to be ready at 6 or 7 in the morning,lol.", "NTA, she was being very rude by making you wait that long.", "NTA.  You offered your partner an Uber as an option.  Her other choice was to GET OUT OF BED.\n\nYour partner seems very controlling.  Why would she want you to sit there and watch her sleep, shower, put on her clothes?  Frankly her behavior is very rude.  Have you 2 been together for very long?  Is this a habit with her?\n\nYou value your family and your traditions.  She has been preventing you from joining in.  She is the A H.", "NTA.  Typically, people who are late are always habitually late.  If she refuses to schedule herself to get there on time then she can take the Uber.  This isn't likely to change so maybe you need to rethink if she is the right one.", "NTA I hate people like this who have no regard for other people\u2019s time. Such entitled behavior.", "NTA. people who have no respect for other people's time drive me nuts", "NTA. \n\nShe can be late if she wants, but she's TA to think that means that you need to sit around in a hotel room while she sleeps instead of visiting family (who live 2k miles away from you!).", "NTA. Some people just don't care about being late. You offered a good solution which was rejected for no reason I can see.", "NTA - your girlfriend fucking sucks my dude. No ifs, ands or buts. You shouldn\u2019t have to hold an adult\u2019s hand through the holidays. You gave her a timeline a head of time, and she chose to fuck around and do what she wants to do. She\u2019s also emotionally manipulating you with her gaslighting bullshit about you \u201cthreatening\u201d her. I\u2019d dump her ass and go to thanksgiving by myself; she can sleep the day away and take the whole evening to get ready for the trip back home.", "NTA. But in your place I would have started treating her like a child at 10:30, until she actually stood up out of bed. Let her get an Uber.", "NTA\n\nShe is behaving like one. Perhaps you could have handled it better by waking her up at 10am and confirming you need to leave by 11am to make sure she is ready. \n\nBut nope, you are definitely not an AH here. She should be more considerate and not make trouble for you.  If it happened to me (sleeping in) I would demand my husband leave without me and apologise to his family for my late arrival. i would also organise my own way there. \n\nThis shouldn't be a drama. Shit happens.", "NTA. She can understand your rush.", "NTA.", "NTA assuming you weren\u2019t being rude. \n\nYou guys had a plan in place -assuming she agreed the night before- but she couldn\u2019t hold to it. \n\nShe had over an hour to get ready after you should have been out the door. \n\nIn my mind getting to the house together is arbitrary. \n\nNote: just because I don\u2019t think YTA doesn\u2019t mean I think she\u2019s wrong for being hurt. I have no idea why getting to places together is important to her.", "Nope.", "Info: How long were you travelling for? Was it a tough journey?", "NTA. But also, it would have ended better if you took the Uber and left your partner the car. (No, you shouldn\u2019t have to, but yes, your relationship matters more than whether you should/shouldn\u2019t have to. I hope at least.)\n\nTBH My spouse is your partner. After years of frustrations like this, I learned to give them time to do their thing and they learned to let me go early (aka on time) and come pick them up later. I highly recommend getting to this point with your spouse because it\u2019s made a huge reduction in frustration in our relationship.\n\nETA: If you can\u2019t get to this point, you may want to rethink your relationship because this situation, if it\u2019s habitual on her part, is unlikely to change.", "INFO: Did you inform her ahead of time that Thanksgiving means the whole day rather just the family dinner?", "NTA. BUT - when visiting partners families, the non-family partner needs private down time and a treat. It can be really overwhelming to go to another families' holiday. So many people. You have to remember the stories that are secrets and stories that are the family joke.\n\nBefore you go, you both need to go over what is going to happen. When it starts, when it ends, are there naps? Tons of booze? No booze?  Football? \n\nIf it were me, as a guest I don't understand why I need to be there for the cooking. I show up an hour or so before being served. If you want to be there\n\nI also suggest that you and she have a little mini-date: a museum, a movie, a hike, etc. Just a few hours with each other.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
