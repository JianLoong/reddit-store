The idea came up, and we found a great deal house almost immediately. So our 2 year plan ended up being more like 2 months. \n\nHusband (50m) calls to share the news with MIL. Her first reaction is to immediately ask for everything she gave us when we moved into that home 16 years ago back. She worked for some time as an art/antiques dealer and gave us some lovely pieces. Wall art, small furniture pieces, and a few small sculptures. \n\nAt the time, husband and I were just dating but things were pretty serious. Serious enough that I kicked in half the cost on appliances and flooring updates, and he upped the bedroom count he'd been hunting for to welcome my toddler. I moved in right away. We started decorating and buying furniture and he brought these pieces from MIL over. And he just said \"aren't these nice? They're from my mom!\" \n\n Sixteen years go by with us living there. We married and had another child. Nothing was ever said about these items, and I grew to love them and have lots of special memories of having them in my home. All this time, I thought they were ours. I asked why he never told me it was loaned, and he said our finances weren't joined yet, then he never thought about it again. \n\nFor the first time I'm informed that they were on loan, and \"very expensive.\" News to me! They've been well loved in a house with small kids. And she knew it. I point out to husband that we've \"loaned\" MIL thousands of dollars over the years. We've also been paying for her cell phone and the SIL's (adult, lives with MIL, doesn't work). Originally they were supposed to pay us the difference for adding them, but, somehow it never happens. It's been a decade and there's no sign of stopping it. \n\nFor context, the two of them live in a house twice the size of ours but have lots of money issues (since MIL had a stroke and can't work anymore.)  They refuse to downsize to cut costs. Their finances are \"none of our business\" until they need money. \n\nI don't think it's right to claw these pieces back. My husband thinks it's hers, so it's only right to give it back. I'm told the fact they don't honor loans to us is \"different.\"\n\nAITA for not wanting to give up the pieces?\n\n**Edit to add**\nSince suggestions to seek repayment seem popular, I wanted to clarify. There is no chance of trying to get the money owed back, nor would I feel right going after them. They really don't have it. \n\nA few years ago I sat down with my husband and said no more \"loans\".  He protested that it's his mother. I pointed out that I'm a mother and we have kids to support, and while we do ok it's not enough to keep subsidizing their lifestyle with direct cash.

A loan for 16 years that she just now wants back when she finds out that you're moving? That sounds really fishy to me. I have a feeling that she gave those pieces to your husband when he was setting up his new house and he doesn't remember her specific words when she gave them to him so to keep the peace he is just agreeing with her now. If she is having money issues, she most likely intends to sell them. \n\nFigure out how much she owes you over all these years and then pick one to three of your favorite pieces. Keep those and then let her know that as soon as she and sil pay you back the amount they owe you then you will give the rest back. \n\nAnd when your husband says something (because he will), let him know that you are neither a storage unit nor a bank.", "ESH\n\nYour husband is the real AH here. How did he forget to mention that you were borrowing furniture/art/whatever?\n\nBut yeah, sadly I think you should give back what your MIL lent you. You would be the AH otherwise. Because it\u2019s not her fault your husband failed to let you know the terms of their agreement.\n\nBut I also believe you should start asking the money back. If they want to count every penny, they need to be aware that is a two-way street.", "ESH. Your husband for not making ownership clear, your in-laws for leaching off you, and you for not setting boundaries with finances. Give the pieces back, move states and then never give them a dime again.", "Give back what she wants, then cut off their phones and whatever other assistance y\u2019all have been giving them.\n\nEveryone \u201cwins\u201d and can stop being AHs to each other.", "So you\u2019re N T A for not WANTING to give them back, buttttt your husband is an Ah for not letting you know they were on loan and your mil is an Ah for taking loans of cash and then demanding property back after never paying off the cash\u2026 idk, this one is tricky. \n\nI\u2019d say ESH, but you the least by miles.

Is he comfortable explaining the art will be moved to your new home and their debt as of (date) will be cleared?", "ESH.  I understand not wanting to give them back, but if they were never his, they were never yours even if you didn't realize it, and he has to give them back when asked.  If they mean enough to the two of you, you could offer to purchase them from her.\n\nBut they also need to pay you what they owe you for phone bills and anything else.", "The art and furniture is in lieu of what they owe you money wise. Talk to your husband, because this is the correct way to clear all balances.", "Info: do you know why she wants them back? Has anyone asked?\n\nIn the comments, I think there's an assumption of pettiness (you're leaving so you need to give up your furniture) that may or may not be the case.\n\nShe could just as easily want a memento of you now that you'll be further away, or of her work now that she's forcibly retired, or if her money issues are this severe she may need to sell them, or... Truly any number of possibilities here\n\nI think if you don't get a reason you should return them as you have them due to an arrangement between her and your husband... I don't think there's an AH but I think it would be valid for you to be upset with both of them given the surprise of it all", "She can have items back when you get the money back. Since getting money back isn't happening, neither is giving items back. Leave it at that", "ESH. Your husband should have told you that these items were a loan from his mother.

If she trusted you with these things for 16 years, she should trust you to take them to keep them safe in your new home. \n\nAs for you, these items were loaned to your husband before you became his wife. You have no claim over them because anything he acquired before the marriage belongs to him. The agreement was between him and his mother. She wants the items back, he wants to give them back. You\u2019re going to have to accept that. If you don\u2019t like paying for your in-laws\u2019 phones, stop paying the bill or make your husband pay it himself out of his personal funds. If you feel she owes you money, sue her.", "NTA. I would tell MIL that since you and your husband have 'loaned' her thousands of dollars over the years, which was never repaid, that she should consider it as payment for the items which she 'loaned' to you both 16 years ago.

But if those items were on loan they were on loan. Two seperate situations. You cant decide to keep whats not yours because they owe you money.\n\nIts sucks for sure, but looks like you mil is getting old and trying desperately to hold onto what she has and knows, and probably is thinnking about selling those items vecauae she needs to.\n\nHave an honest conversation about what you hope to keep and maybe make some arrangements.", "NTA at all, and I would not give anything back until those 'loans' are payed backed. Also, stop the bleeding immediately! No more paying for someone else's phone bills... Change your phone plans and leave them to their own devices... If she insists on having these items back charge her 16 years' rent worth of storage of them.", "NTA.\n\nBut out of curiosity what do you mean by this statement\n\n(42f) recently moved to a new state (TX to CO), primarily since our\nyounger son's celiac is easier to manage in a more liberal leaning area. \n\nHow did living in tx, a non-left leaning state adversely impact your ability to manage your son's celiac?", "NTA for how you feel, but this is your husbands battle to fight. He should NOT have given you the impression they were gifts. He should have told you they were on loan and would need to be returned. \n\n16 years though? Seriously? I mean I feel like you might check the legal definition of property; unless she has some kind of agreement you\u2019re unaware of, this sounds like it set the precedent that it\u2019s your property and frankly I\u2019m not sure id give it back. It\u2019s still up to your husband to have that dialogue with her though.\n\nMy suspicion is that this is a way to show she\u2019s not happy about your move. \n\nEither way, don\u2019t nickel and dime them over the phone plans, if you haven\u2019t been doing that before. Turning this into a tit for tat situation is only going to make it worse.", "NTA.  I can't believe all the Y-T-A and E-S-Hs?  What did Op do that's an AH move?  What sane human would not be shocked to find this was a loan?  MIL is in dire financial straits and looking for some money any way she can. Have the furniture appraised and then decide if you want to \"buy her out\" or how to handle the situation. Chances are kids love devalued the furniture way more than MIL thinks. Also tell hubs it's his mess and he needs to be the one working for a solution.  Good luck.", "NTA. Count up the value of all the \"loans\" you've paid out that you'll never get back from MIL. Do some research on the value of the furniture/etc. pieces she's \"loaned\" you both. Starting with the ones you love the most, reconcile the amounts. The leftover pieces (if there are any) should be returned to MIL. She might want to sell them.", "Maybe have an open talk with her first. NAH.", "NTA, but I wonder if Texas of all states has some \"abandonment\" ownership law. They've sat on your property for so long, and if there is no loan paperwork I'd say tough shit.", "NTA- you were never informed these things were \"on loan\" and that is really unfair. However, I think there are other things going on here. You and hubs are leaving her all alone and taking your support with you(which is not JUST financial), her finances are probably failing and she saw these pieces as a backup plan in case it ever got really bad, but was too ashamed to say so. Things may have gotten that bad now, or she may be lashing out because she feels \"abandoned.\" You're not, you have to do what's right for your family, but I'm afraid you have to return the items. You could request to keep a few items you're extra fond of, but be prepared to let them go.", "In answer to your question, you are NTA but it sounds like these items should be returned.\n\nI know that's going to suck, but I'd look at this as a perfect opportunity to cut this toxic nonsense out of your life. Return the items along with a notice that their phones will be removed from your plan on X date. No more lending them money. No more covering bills for them.\n\nI see several other people have suggested billing them what they owe you from your loans over the years. That feels like a long, dead-end road to me (you know what they say about lending to family) but if you think it's feasible, go for it! At the very least though, I'd get hubby on board with the idea of giving the antiques back and cutting off the cash flow (phones being the most obvious but if they're connected to your streaming services, internet, or anything else, kick 'em off that too).

They \"owe\" you thousands. Still take advantage by continuing to have you pay for their phones. One of which you agreed to pay, but not the other.

Also see if you can get how much they were actually worth 16 years ago because that really should be the value of the \"loan\" (ex.: a piece of the artwork actually turns out to be $25K today, but 16 years ago was only worth $2,500 thus the value of that part of the \"loan\" is only $2,500 and not $25K). If it is something that looks like it could be valuable get an appraisal from someone with the proper knowledge, maybe from one of the big auction houses (Christie's or Sotheby's come to mind). Once you have that knowledge, tally up the monetary \"loans\" and if the amounts reach equivalent exchange then politely state that the \"loans\" that you know you will never recover have been payed for by the artwork. If your husband complains, then tell him that you know there is no hope of getting the money back that you are owed and so this is the repayment. If any of them (your husband, MIL, or SIL) decide to argue against that (\"it's not the same\" is not a good enough argument...a loan is a loan at this point) then demand that the artwork be sold by an independent 3rd party with no ties to anyone in the family and that money will be what goes into the repayment of the various loans you and your husband provided over the years. If you can succeed in that, earmark the money specifically for the kids (maybe a college fund) and put it into a trust account that can't be touched except for that purpose (taking money from kids tends to make the ones taking it look like the villains). That way your husband can't sneakily return the money to MIL and SIL via another \"loan\". Now, after you have accomplished this, if there is any money/artwork left over after the monetary loans have been repaid, you may have to let that go/return it to MIL. Make it clear that if you do return the artwork to MIL and she turns around and sells them, you WILL take her to court to recoup the cost of the loans you and your husband have provided her over the years as she will now have the funds to repay the loans you gave her.", "If he had this arrangement with her previously he really should have told you, but you can't try to keep the items if they weren't actually given as a gift. ESH\n\nI'm glad you have a \"no more loans\" philosophy you're sticking too going forward, that's good!", "Yeah we have quite a few pieces in our house that are 'indefinite loan' items. Basically we can keep them indefinitely, but if we ever stop using them they must be given back and can't be given to someone else or sold. They also recognize that the items may not stay pristine in our house lol.
