There are still a couple of siblings still living in the family home to save money for their own place. This situation involves my younger sister Jess (27f). \n\nMy family immigrated to the US several decades ago. We are a very family oriented culture. It\u2019s a common thing in our culture for children to live with the parents well into adulthood. It\u2019s expected that we pitch in to make the family stronger. For example, when I was younger, I had a hard time with math so my older cousin tutored me everyday. Another example is that older family members regularly babysit the younger siblings and cousins.\n\nJess lives with my parents (since graduating college) doesn\u2019t have to pay rent, and they pay for the food. There\u2019s been an on going argument between them because she keeps to herself and doesn\u2019t help out with the family. For example, my aunt asked her to tutor our little cousin in chemistry and she refused, saying it\u2019s not her job. Another time an uncle asked her to babysit and she refused by saying she didn\u2019t have the children so it\u2019s not her responsibility. Things got bad recently. \n\nThe last straw came when dad cooked dinner the night before and everyone was running late the next day. Since she was going to be the first one home, he texted her and asked her to heat up dinner for the family. When they got home, nothing was done so he asked her about it. She said she heated her dinner and ate. She went on to say they\u2019re adults and it\u2019s not her job to take care of them. It blew into a huge argument.\n\nDad accused her of not being part of the family and her attitude is not part of our culture. She answered that we live in the US, not in the old country and the culture here is that people take care of their own children and themselves. She told him the kids are not her moneys so it\u2019s not her circus. Dad was furious and fired back saying she can\u2019t pick and choose the parts of different cultures that only benefits her. He went on to say that Americans leave the house at 18 and it\u2019s not part of American culture to allow a 27yo live at home so he kicked her out.\n\nShe called me crying saying that she\u2019s now homeless and that dad is an ass. I told her that our parents paid for her schooling so she has 2 degrees and  no debt. They also allowed her to live their rent free and even paid for her food so she\u2019s been able to save up close to $75,000. I told her that it\u2019s true she\u2019s homeless but she\u2019s not helpless. With her job and savings, she can stay at a nice hotel and have an apartment tomorrow. I told her I also agree when he said she can\u2019t pick and choose to follow only the cultural parts that only benefits her. She called me an ass like dad then hung up.\n\nAm I an ass?", "created_utc": 1667676995, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yn3w6o/aita_telling_my_younger_sister_dad_was_right_to/", "score": 147, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But better late than never.", "NTA, Your Dad is right, so are you. I'm Canadian, we're pretty similar to Americans in many ways. Not sure where in the US you live but its normal that adults do live on their own sometimes after high school OR pay rent at home - though many families have a system that parents support as long as child is in school (including post secondary). Definitely in Canada its a normal expectation to help support your own family and friends, babysitting and tutoring are perfectly fine to ask. Like Reddit posts where a 18 year old is kicked out on their 18th birthday are sadly common but MOST people are outraged by it.\nYour own families expectations aren't out of left field, as you have described them. \nYour sister sounds overly self centered and narcissistic. Time for her to grow up. \nNTA, but your sister is. Sounds like she's about to get a 3rd degree from the school of tough love. Good for your Dad", "NTA.   This has nothing to do with cultures.

She can\u2019t expect to always take and never give.", "NTA as long as you realistically represented your sister's situation. If they really only asked her to help out occasionally then she isn't pulling her weight. She's going to have a hard time in life with her entitled attitude.", "NTA - haha how did she think this one would play out? She said adults were able to take care of themselves so she can prove it now.", "NTA your dad and you were exactly right. She doesnt pay into the system, so shouldn\u2019t expect to make withdrawals either. She sounds incredibly selfish and I hope this acts as a wake up call for her. \n\nI found traditional expectations difficult myself, so I became independent and don\u2019t expect my relatives to do the kind of favors they do for each other. So I wouldn\u2019t house a cousin who is coming to the states for college like my parents did when I was a kid, but I also don\u2019t ask relatives to help me move or buy things for me overseas or expect to use their homes when I want to travel.  Even outside the cultural context - it\u2019s selfish to expect to benefit from others while giving nothing back.", "NTA. Your sister sounds like a culmination of the stereotypes the older generation likes to level at us: entitled, spoiled, lazy.

She has money, she has the tools to succeed, she needs to make an effort.", "NTA\n\nYes she\u2019s not obligated to help tutor children etc, but as your Dad said, they are not obligated to pay for her after age 18.", "NTA. 6 years ago, I moved out at 19. I still help my dad with my youngest sibling. Your sister seems really entitled and should feel lucky and be grateful that your parents provided for her this long without expecting much in return. My family have always been expected to help each other out as much as reasonably possible. Including helping with shopping, cooking, dishes, general cleaning, tutoring younger family members in school subjects you excel in as well. Shes allowed to say no, or have a reason to not be able to do something.

Your father is right and your sister is rude and entitled. There is a saying don't bite the hand that feeds you. So many people would kill to be in the position your sister is in. She is an ungrateful brat. No one in the family should do her any more favors. Shunning works wonders.", "NTA", "ESH, she has a point about the tutoring.

They aren't the people housing her, so she doesn't owe them anything and they are trying to take advantage of her by having her do unpaid tutoring.\n\nShe was being an ass by refusing to heat up dinner for the people she lives with for no reason. It just sounds like she took your whole family's message that she is not allowed to have any boundaries and over-corrected, and also is entitled. \n\nI think you are an asshole for saying that she's not allowed to have any boundaries, because with time things evolve. Her setting boundaries that she wasn't going to take care of other people's children is not her being an asshole. Her being nasty to your parents, who are financially supporting her as well as housing her, and playing helpless was.\n\nSo yeah, I think both you and your sister are assholes in this situation.", "ESH it most certainly is not American culture to stop helping your kids at 18. He should have given her a set time of when she needed to move by", "I'm Canadian too,  I stayed past 18,  but paid my share", ">as long as you realistically represented your sister's situation\n\nThat is the crux of the matter, although not just the amount they're asking Jess to help, as you point out, it's also the amount of help Jess has been given. OP describes a situation where he received tutoring from an older cousin but gave no examples of extended family helping Jess and no examples of him being made to help extended family. That's the red flag that makes me think he's not representing the situation realistically. People are often blinded by their own perspective, especially when evaluating siblings, they think because they grew up with the same family members that they grew up with the same family.\n\nPaying for education and living in the family home to save as a young adult is something the parents have extended to all their children, it's fair that Jess gets the same extension. Did they have to do it for her? no. But they didn't have to do it for any of their children, the parents know it would look blatantly unfair if they did it for some children but not others.\n\nFairness on a few key things isn't the same as treating your children fairly, maybe their parents know the illusion of equality can be weaponized against the child who was overall cared for less or given less but from whom they expect more. After all, you can't manipulate someone if you can't hold your generous actions over them and flying monkeys need ammo when they're dispatched.\n\nOr maybe the parents simply think that because many of their other children received help that Jess also did. OP says \"many of my older siblings\" who moved out before him and \"a couple siblings still \\[living at home\\]\" so there's OP, Jess, \"a couple\" = 2, and many implies a majority so \"many\" = 5? This is a family of at least 9 kids, you can't tell me that not one of them fell through the cracks of parental or family attention.\n\nOP describes the family culture being from their immigrant parent's country of origin, OP is male, I don't know of a single \"immigrant family culture\" that doesn't value male children far above female children. I could throw a rock at my laptop and have it bounce off 3 posts on this forum every week about the immigrant dynamic that expects the girl children to do a heap of chores while the boy children sit around being catered to like little kings.\n\nOne thing for sure that proves OP has backwards logic on the situation: if an older cousin babysat you, unpaid as a favour, when you were a child, that's not something you have to pay back. You were a minor who needed to be under supervision, it was your parents responsibility to supervise you or provide alternate supervision. The return of the favour is owed to the cousin by the parents, not the now adult child who the cousin babysat. That's another red flag on this post.", "her payment is her parents letting her live in their house and eat their food without charging her anything. she\u2019s grown up in this family and seen her brother and older cousins helping out; it shouldn\u2019t have come as a surprise to her that she would also be expected to do so. she likely also got tutoring/help from family members when she was younger, but she doesn\u2019t want to do it herself? she can\u2019t expect to be a part of this family without being willing to help out every once in a while when it\u2019s needed. if she doesn\u2019t want to, she can move out. she\u2019s picking and choosing parts of their culture that only benefit her.", "bro they paid for her degree and let her live for free until 27. also paid for the food she ate but refused to even reheat (reheat not cook) for the family. something tells me she's had PLENTY of help."]}
