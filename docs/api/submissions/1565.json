There are still a couple of siblings still living in the family home to save money for their own place. This situation involves my younger sister Jess (27f). \n\nMy family immigrated to the US several decades ago. We are a very family oriented culture. It\u2019s a common thing in our culture for children to live with the parents well into adulthood. It\u2019s expected that we pitch in to make the family stronger. For example, when I was younger, I had a hard time with math so my older cousin tutored me everyday. Another example is that older family members regularly babysit the younger siblings and cousins.\n\nJess lives with my parents (since graduating college) doesn\u2019t have to pay rent, and they pay for the food. There\u2019s been an on going argument between them because she keeps to herself and doesn\u2019t help out with the family. For example, my aunt asked her to tutor our little cousin in chemistry and she refused, saying it\u2019s not her job. Another time an uncle asked her to babysit and she refused by saying she didn\u2019t have the children so it\u2019s not her responsibility. Things got bad recently. \n\nThe last straw came when dad cooked dinner the night before and everyone was running late the next day. Since she was going to be the first one home, he texted her and asked her to heat up dinner for the family. When they got home, nothing was done so he asked her about it. She said she heated her dinner and ate. She went on to say they\u2019re adults and it\u2019s not her job to take care of them. It blew into a huge argument.\n\nDad accused her of not being part of the family and her attitude is not part of our culture. She answered that we live in the US, not in the old country and the culture here is that people take care of their own children and themselves. She told him the kids are not her moneys so it\u2019s not her circus. Dad was furious and fired back saying she can\u2019t pick and choose the parts of different cultures that only benefits her. He went on to say that Americans leave the house at 18 and it\u2019s not part of American culture to allow a 27yo live at home so he kicked her out.\n\nShe called me crying saying that she\u2019s now homeless and that dad is an ass. I told her that our parents paid for her schooling so she has 2 degrees and  no debt. They also allowed her to live their rent free and even paid for her food so she\u2019s been able to save up close to $75,000. I told her that it\u2019s true she\u2019s homeless but she\u2019s not helpless. With her job and savings, she can stay at a nice hotel and have an apartment tomorrow. I told her I also agree when he said she can\u2019t pick and choose to follow only the cultural parts that only benefits her. She called me an ass like dad then hung up.\n\nAm I an ass?", "created_utc": 1667676995, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yn3w6o/aita_telling_my_younger_sister_dad_was_right_to/", "score": 1156, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your father is right and your sister is rude and entitled. There is a saying don't bite the hand that feeds you. So many people would kill to be in the position your sister is in.

Her setting boundaries that she wasn't going to take care of other people's children is not her being an asshole. Her being nasty to your parents, who are financially supporting her as well as housing her, and playing helpless was.\n\nSo yeah, I think both you and your sister are assholes in this situation.", "ESH it most certainly is not American culture to stop helping your kids at 18. He should have given her a set time of when she needed to move by", "I'm Canadian too,  I stayed past 18,  but paid my share", ">as long as you realistically represented your sister's situation\n\nThat is the crux of the matter, although not just the amount they're asking Jess to help, as you point out, it's also the amount of help Jess has been given. OP describes a situation where he received tutoring from an older cousin but gave no examples of extended family helping Jess and no examples of him being made to help extended family. That's the red flag that makes me think he's not representing the situation realistically. People are often blinded by their own perspective, especially when evaluating siblings, they think because they grew up with the same family members that they grew up with the same family.\n\nPaying for education and living in the family home to save as a young adult is something the parents have extended to all their children, it's fair that Jess gets the same extension. Did they have to do it for her? no. But they didn't have to do it for any of their children, the parents know it would look blatantly unfair if they did it for some children but not others.\n\nFairness on a few key things isn't the same as treating your children fairly, maybe their parents know the illusion of equality can be weaponized against the child who was overall cared for less or given less but from whom they expect more. After all, you can't manipulate someone if you can't hold your generous actions over them and flying monkeys need ammo when they're dispatched.\n\nOr maybe the parents simply think that because many of their other children received help that Jess also did. OP says \"many of my older siblings\" who moved out before him and \"a couple siblings still \\[living at home\\]\" so there's OP, Jess, \"a couple\" = 2, and many implies a majority so \"many\" = 5? This is a family of at least 9 kids, you can't tell me that not one of them fell through the cracks of parental or family attention.\n\nOP describes the family culture being from their immigrant parent's country of origin, OP is male, I don't know of a single \"immigrant family culture\" that doesn't value male children far above female children. I could throw a rock at my laptop and have it bounce off 3 posts on this forum every week about the immigrant dynamic that expects the girl children to do a heap of chores while the boy children sit around being catered to like little kings.\n\nOne thing for sure that proves OP has backwards logic on the situation: if an older cousin babysat you, unpaid as a favour, when you were a child, that's not something you have to pay back. You were a minor who needed to be under supervision, it was your parents responsibility to supervise you or provide alternate supervision. The return of the favour is owed to the cousin by the parents, not the now adult child who the cousin babysat. That's another red flag on this post.", "her payment is her parents letting her live in their house and eat their food without charging her anything. she\u2019s grown up in this family and seen her brother and older cousins helping out; it shouldn\u2019t have come as a surprise to her that she would also be expected to do so. she likely also got tutoring/help from family members when she was younger, but she doesn\u2019t want to do it herself? she can\u2019t expect to be a part of this family without being willing to help out every once in a while when it\u2019s needed. if she doesn\u2019t want to, she can move out. she\u2019s picking and choosing parts of their culture that only benefit her.", "bro they paid for her degree and let her live for free until 27. also paid for the food she ate but refused to even reheat (reheat not cook) for the family. something tells me she's had PLENTY of help.", "LOL NTA", "She's not homeless.

I'm white, and American, but I live in a part of America where most people are not white and multi-generational living is the norm. I am 40 and have a nine year old, and after college I came back home because rent is insane (another reason why multi-generation of living is the norm here). My parents would never have charged me rent or billed me for food or anything else for living at home, but I also was at home to help take care of them. I was working full-time but did the majority of cooking and cleaning. I was my mom's hospice nurse at home for 5 years while she died of cancer, and now I take care of my father, who has dementia. \n\nWhile in my area this is not atypical, I know from things I have read online that in general in America it is considered weird for adult children to live at home and not pay rent. I frequently see that being referred to as \"freeloading,\" but when you are there taking care of your family, it's just making the family stronger. \n\nI can't imagine staying at home and expecting to be taken care of as family without taking care of your family in return. It sounds like your sister wants to have a very one-sided relationship with the family, and I don't see anything wrong with your parents not going for that.", "NTA. It actually isn\u2019t uncommon for adults in their 20\u2019s to live with their parents in this day and age.

People on here like to say things like 'you didn't choose to have those children' and such. \n\nThe nuance here, largely unspoken, in the oft quoted 'you don't owe anyone anything' is 'but they don't owe you anything either' (insert exceptions for minors and legal contracts here). So if your family is making your life easier without requiring pay, then yes the expectation is that you make their life easier in return - without requiring pay. Because in a world where no one owes anyone, generosity and kindness towards others needs to be met with generosity and kindness in kind in order to survive.\n\nAs someone quoted in a post here recently, your sister has set the ground rules of her relationship with your family.

Now she gets to live the culture she supports, where adults take care of themselves, including her.", "Your dad is right. Your sister is selfish and entitled. Nta", "Esh", "NTA\n\nYour father is absolutely correct, she can\u2019t cherry pick. I want free lodging, food, car, college, etc. But I refuse any responsibility to the people who make that happen. If you want to not answer to anyone, then be independent. She\u2019s selfish and a free loader.", "NAH. You stand by the family \"culture\" and there's nothing wrong with that. She doesn't, and apparently hasn't in some time. She has that right.\n\nAs long as she doesn't come crawling to you for help with her homework, or resume, or job contacts, or whatever, she's free to live as she chooses.\n\nYou choose the \"family culture\" and you're not wrong either.\n\nDo you want to maintain a great relationship with her? Does she want that? Then find a middle ground that exists just between the two of you. Otherwise let her go.", "I completely agree NTA!  \n\nAn American Family culture, family members do what it takes to pitch in and help out. You better believe that anyone who does not feel self entitled beyond reason who would get a text message from their father saying hey please heat dinner we're all running late, that family member would indeed be the one to heat up dinner so everybody could eat. Why? Because most people know the two word philosophy \"Family Does!\" Translation family does whatever it can to help each other out. \n\nWhen we were kids my sister was diagnosed with juvenile arthritis, this meant she had a lot of problems from time to time. This meant whether I wanted to or not I was sent out with her when she went out to hang out with most of her friends because I knew how to help her when a joint popped out of place.", "I guess you don't know any first generation immigrants because this is something an \"Americanized\" first generation immigrant would do lol. She's living that American life while exploiting the culture her parents grew up on in order to get ahead. I could've done the same to be honest. My parents and I immigrated in the US when I was a teen and at 19 I got a decent job but they still wanted me to keep living with them for free and keep all my earnings for myself. I had to convince them that I wanted to move out and try to grow as a person.\n\nThe daughter clearly had the same arrangement with her parents but refuse to do the basics even for her own family as simple as heating leftovers for them before getting home under the individualist culture while she's enjoying benefits provided by her parents family centric culture.", "NTA.", "Entitled little witch. NTA", "I disagree strongly that you can\u2019t pick and choose what parts of culture or tradition you listen to. Your sister can choose to not follow family culture as much as she wants. But your family doesn\u2019t have to treat her as she wants to be treated either, if the social contract doesn\u2019t feel fulfilled on your side drop her hand for sure.", "You are definitely not the ah. \n\nYour sister is an entitled brat", "NTA\n\nYou guys asked for her to do simple things and she was too selfish to do them. Now she's on her own.", "NTA. While I agree no one is obligated to care for other people's children, it's stupid to refuse helping out if you're dependant on the help and generosity of others. If you leave others to fend for themselves, expect them to do the same to you.", "YTA. She\u2019s clearly not comfortable watching children, idk why anyone would want her to. Your \u201cculture\u201d is sexist.", "NTA. I know many fellow Americans who have Jess attitude and their parents do the same thing your did. Jess wants to be Ms. Independent like other 27 college graduates are and your father helped her wish come true. In other words she F'ed around and found out.", "NTA. Your sister is a hypocrite, only accepting the parts of different cultures that she benefits from. She is also a fool for biting the hand that feeds her. She obviously believes that the world revolves around her. Your parents' big mistake was not nipping this in the bud when she first started signs of this selfishness.\n\nShe will find out soon enough that the rest of the world has little use for someone that is so self-centered.", "I would say NAH... Sister has full right to refuse those activities, no one is entitled to her time. Also dad has a right to kick her out. Actions and consequences. You just said how it is. Understandably, she feels hurt.", "NTA. Your sister is far from being helpless and homeless. Good for your dad for cracking down on her. she\u2019s acting like an entitled brat.", "NTA. She sounds massively oblivious and like she needed some things pointing out to her...", "NTA. Your sister knew what she was doing, she's reaped her own benefits from your cultural family arrangements but contributed nothing. Your response to her was spot on.", "NTA. Idk what kind of american culture she's experienced but my upbringing was similar to yours in that family chips in as best as we can, very much so \"it takes a village.\" Refusing to heat up dinner for the family and then just doing it for yourself is incredibly rude. \n\nYou gave her a much needed reality check. She will be fine when she gets her shit together and stops victimizing herself.", "NTA, I don't mean any disrespect but your sister is an ungrateful little brat. I get that It's not her responsibility to help with her cousins but that stunt she pulled with the dinner is unacceptable. Specially if she's living there for free. Does she have a demanding job or something?", "NTA. Your parents did a lot for your sister. They didn\u2019t expect much from her, especially living there rent free/free food.", "NTA.  Hopefully this will be the thing that finally gets her to stop being an AH.", "NTA..wow! She heated up a plate for herself? Talk about selfish!", "NTA - I could understand not helping with the childcare actually but not heating dinner up for everyone is petty and mean.", "NTA SHE has been kicked to the curb.  Poor sister.", "She sounds like an entitled spoiled little brat! She expects your family to look after her while giving 0% in return. I side with your Dad on this one.", "YTA. She's a woman and she's being punished for it, that simple. As a woman who also comes from 'culture' that hate women and especially 'idle women' I can smell the stink a mile away. Your sister doesn't owe anyone tutoring and table setting for adults and babysitting, and isn't deserve to get kicked out of the house because of that. 'wonder' why she kept to herself.", "NGL, this reply surprised me a bit. I can't count the number of times on this sub when OP's sister's reasoning was regarded as a completely valid justification for other posters refusing to help out family members.\n\nSo genuine curiosity - is OP's sister T.A. in this situation for refusing to help because she's not paying rent? Would it be different if she was paying rent?", "> Lmao \"law\" that only applies if she is a tenant which she is not due to the fact no financial contribution, rent, or even a contract.\n\nThat is legally the wrong definition of tenant - she still has tenant's rights in this situation as she is a resident there. None of those are factors in determining tenancy, only length of time and use as a primary address.", "I'm not the person you're replying to, but yeah, although it's not just about rent imo. I think that she is reaping all the benefits of having an involved and helpful family, and giving absolutely nothing back in return. Someone made that dinner for her and she couldn't even be arsed reheating it for them.", "> I can't count the number of times on this sub when OP's sister's reasoning was regarded as a completely valid justification for other posters refusing to help out family members.\n\nThose posters are usually either A) minors or B) independent adults."]}
