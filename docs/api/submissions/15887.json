Congratulations on being able to set boundaries.  This idea that because someone has the same DNA as you, that they should be able to treat you like garbage and you have to take it over and over is ridiculous.  Wouldn't surprise me if your mom's parents pushed this 'because family' line on her too.\n\nI don't know how you navigate the fact that mom is paying some for your wedding, but if your aunt somehow got super offended at your birthday, she might decide not to show up at the wedding.", "NTA I agree wholeheartedly that family means nothing. I cut my parents out of my life almost a year ago and it's been fantastic for my mental health. To me true family is who you choose to keep around --it can be blood relations but it doesn't have to be.\n\nAnyway, it's YOUR wedding. Even if this talk is hypothetical it's important to set expectations early. I wish I hadn't invited my aunt on my mom's side because she and her husband SAT IN THE FRONT ROW like clueless fucks so my partner's parents couldn't and it would've caused a scene by the time we realized what had happened.", "NTA and tell your mom \u201cif you want to be a doormat to mistreatment go ahead, but it won\u2019t happen on my dime or my watch.\u201d", "If your mom's paying for a major portion of the wedding she definitely does get to invite some people of her choosing. \nBut from what I read, you seem to have a really good relationship with your mom and I do feel sad for her for feeling that she's obligated to/ expected to tolerate mistreatment from people just because they're family, I don't think you can really change her perspective on it at 55. You can try for her sake but it may continue to prove futile. And keep calling out your cousin's bad behaviour towards her so maybe someday she wants to take a stand for herself. \n\nAs far as your cousin is concerned you've said in multiple comments that your reason to not invite them to anything is not to \"punish\" then you just don't want their drama. I feel not inviting would cause more drama especially since your mom js paying for/hosting both the events so it would cause drama for her. \nYour only 2 options would be to confront this cousin and call her out and explain why she's shitty to your mom and you don't condone it. \nOr let your mom deal with it how she sees fits, without involving yourself too much into the situation. but make sure to look out for her and tell her when she's being mistreated. \n\nEven if she (cousin) does come to the wedding you could just ignore her and move on with your day, if it would really mean that much to your mom.\n\nETA: NTA, imo but neither is your mom.", "From a casual observer, I cant make it make sense that if she\u2019s so awful you\u2019re fine with her at one thing but not the other\u2026 Sounds like you want to punish this person for not being kind to your mother but essentially the person you\u2019ll be hurting is your mother.

The real question is:\n\n**If mom is paying for a large portion of my wedding, is she entitled to invite people (even if I don't like those people)?**\n\nThe answer is: Yes.  YTA.  If mom is paying for the wedding, she should be able to influence the guest lists - because she's PAYING FOR IT.  Clearly your mom doesn't think the cousin is as horrible as you.\n\nIf you don't want to invite the cousin, that's your choice - but don't accept your mom's money.  This is the great part of being an adult, you get to choose.", "YTA for being the white knight when no one asked you to be. Talk to your mom n dad first.

I really think you need to think of the impact not inviting this person will have on your mother. Despite your opinion on their relationship, it\u2019s important to your mother and you are going to put her in a very awkward and unhappy place and it could bring some unwelcome sourness to the whole event. You need to think very hard if this is the the hill you want to die on when it comes to you expressing your displeasure re this person\u2019s relationship with your mother\u2026", "OK, so it's all hypothetical at the moment. You can relax a bit and deal with the invitation issue when there is actually a wedding to invite people to.", "So this is the trick.\n\nYou want to \"punish\" or skip the cousin.  But guess what, the cousin probably loves the drama.\n\nNOT inviting the cousin will cause your mother pain and the cousin pleasure.", "Wait, you didn\u2019t rent the place out and just\u2026expected the regulars to not be there because you chose the place for your birthday party?", "I would, but the primary reason she\u2019s paying isn\u2019t because we can\u2019t financially support it ourselves, it\u2019s because she wants to.

I'd have asked the staff to make them leave, and if they didn't I would have demanded at least some my money back for the rental.
