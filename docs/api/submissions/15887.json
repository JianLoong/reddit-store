Mom got upset and started to cry and say how it was unfair despite my brother being abusive towards me.\n\nShe said he had to go so I told her he didn't and if she kept it up them she didn't have to go either.", "Info: are you actually engaged or were you just talking about this to make a point?", "NTA.  Congratulations on being able to set boundaries.  This idea that because someone has the same DNA as you, that they should be able to treat you like garbage and you have to take it over and over is ridiculous.  Wouldn't surprise me if your mom's parents pushed this 'because family' line on her too.\n\nI don't know how you navigate the fact that mom is paying some for your wedding, but if your aunt somehow got super offended at your birthday, she might decide not to show up at the wedding.", "NTA I agree wholeheartedly that family means nothing. I cut my parents out of my life almost a year ago and it's been fantastic for my mental health. To me true family is who you choose to keep around --it can be blood relations but it doesn't have to be.\n\nAnyway, it's YOUR wedding. Even if this talk is hypothetical it's important to set expectations early. I wish I hadn't invited my aunt on my mom's side because she and her husband SAT IN THE FRONT ROW like clueless fucks so my partner's parents couldn't and it would've caused a scene by the time we realized what had happened.", "NTA and tell your mom \u201cif you want to be a doormat to mistreatment go ahead, but it won\u2019t happen on my dime or my watch.\u201d", "If your mom's paying for a major portion of the wedding she definitely does get to invite some people of her choosing. \nBut from what I read, you seem to have a really good relationship with your mom and I do feel sad for her for feeling that she's obligated to/ expected to tolerate mistreatment from people just because they're family, I don't think you can really change her perspective on it at 55. You can try for her sake but it may continue to prove futile. And keep calling out your cousin's bad behaviour towards her so maybe someday she wants to take a stand for herself. \n\nAs far as your cousin is concerned you've said in multiple comments that your reason to not invite them to anything is not to \"punish\" then you just don't want their drama. I feel not inviting would cause more drama especially since your mom js paying for/hosting both the events so it would cause drama for her. \nYour only 2 options would be to confront this cousin and call her out and explain why she's shitty to your mom and you don't condone it. \nOr let your mom deal with it how she sees fits, without involving yourself too much into the situation. but make sure to look out for her and tell her when she's being mistreated. \n\nEven if she (cousin) does come to the wedding you could just ignore her and move on with your day, if it would really mean that much to your mom.\n\nETA: NTA, imo but neither is your mom.", "From a casual observer, I cant make it make sense that if she\u2019s so awful you\u2019re fine with her at one thing but not the other\u2026 Sounds like you want to punish this person for not being kind to your mother but essentially the person you\u2019ll be hurting is your mother. Suck it up.", "INFO: Are you actually engaged?", "Ah, a good twist on all the wedding posts.  The noise about your cousin's drama doesn't matter.  The real question is:\n\n**If mom is paying for a large portion of my wedding, is she entitled to invite people (even if I don't like those people)?**\n\nThe answer is: Yes.  YTA.  If mom is paying for the wedding, she should be able to influence the guest lists - because she's PAYING FOR IT.  Clearly your mom doesn't think the cousin is as horrible as you.\n\nIf you don't want to invite the cousin, that's your choice - but don't accept your mom's money.  This is the great part of being an adult, you get to choose.", "YTA for being the white knight when no one asked you to be. Talk to your mom n dad first.

My mum\u2019s hosting :/", "I meant that my mum is helping to pay for the wedding, not Annie. Because my mum is helping to pay, she feels that she has some say in some of the people she invites, even if I don\u2019t like them.", "Yeah, that makes sense! I think the reason I feel more inclined to invite her to the bday party is because my mum is hosting it at her house, so she\u2019s essentially the one inviting her.", "My boyfriend and I are very open about this discussion with each other, and they plan to propose in the next few months.", "Not for another couple years. The conversation with my mum was very casual, but it was something I wanted to address early on", "My boyfriend and I talk openly about this, and they are planning to propose in a couple months.", "My wedding is more important than my birthday party.

My mum paying for it is a big reason why I think I should invite her. My love for my mum comes above my dislike for Annie, and I don\u2019t want to cause any problems. \n\nHowever, I will say that she does think she\u2019s horrible. She says that the reason she stays in contact with her is mostly familial obligation rather than actually liking her.", "I wouldn\u2019t really say \u201cfighting\u201d. There wasn\u2019t any shouting, and my mum was very understanding. If me not inviting her really upsets her, I\u2019ll invite her. My love for my mum will come above my dislike for Annie any day.", "i understand. but in the end it should be still your decision, because it\u00b4s your party and your birthday. \n\nfor my 18th we had the party at a local pub and i was kind of annoyed some guests were at my party, because they are regulars. didn\u00b4t say anything, because they didn\u00b4t interefere, but it was supposed to be just my family and friends and staff", "You a shouldn\u2019t have someone who want kind and loving to you growing up.  I would be petty and tell your mom if she insists that this cousin must be invited but you will be having a private ceremony for you to have the people you feel safe with and if mom insists on cousin coming she won\u2019t be invited either. You\u2019re 20 and hopefully you want a marriage more than a wedding", "Lol, yup, I re read the post and make the edit needed before noticing you were commenting on that.\nNo, mom paying daughters wedding should not give free invitation pass for anyone... So yes, you're on the right side, it's your wedding, your list of invitees...\nBUT remember that being on the right doesn't  always work... \ud83d\ude14. In parents-daughters or son relationships, unfortunately... NEVER works.\nSo yes, you can not invite the aunt and you will be on the right... And you will get your mom's meltdown anyway. Don't see any exit on that frontline.\nBut... I'm Chilean, so maybe that's why. XD", "NTA but I suggest waiting to get married until you and your boyfriend can pay for it yourselves.  This way you can keep the assholes in your family out.", "I wouldn't accept your mother's money...than she has no say.", "Okay that makes a bit more sense. Going to go with NTA you're definitely entitled to feel how you feel, and I agree with it.", "Also, I\u2019m not trying to \u201cpunish\u201d her. I just don\u2019t want anything to do with her.", "Nevertheless, traditionally, if the parents are providing financial support for the wedding it is an expectation that they have a say who comes. I really think you need to think of the impact not inviting this person will have on your mother. Despite your opinion on their relationship, it\u2019s important to your mother and you are going to put her in a very awkward and unhappy place and it could bring some unwelcome sourness to the whole event. You need to think very hard if this is the the hill you want to die on when it comes to you expressing your displeasure re this person\u2019s relationship with your mother\u2026", "OK, so it's all hypothetical at the moment. You can relax a bit and deal with the invitation issue when there is actually a wedding to invite people to.", "So this is the trick.\n\nYou want to \"punish\" or skip the cousin.  But guess what, the cousin probably loves the drama.\n\nNOT inviting the cousin will cause your mother pain and the cousin pleasure.", "Wait, you didn\u2019t rent the place out and just\u2026expected the regulars to not be there because you chose the place for your birthday party?", "I would, but the primary reason she\u2019s paying isn\u2019t because we can\u2019t financially support it ourselves, it\u2019s because she wants to. She\u2019s told me she\u2019d pay for most of it even if we got married in ten years time and had full-time jobs", "Well that comes across as disingenuous because you\u2019re happy for her to be at your BD", "I don\u2019t really want to punish her, just have nothing to do with her. Honestly, though, you make a good point.", "we did rent the place out, and it was announced it will be a private party. \n\nso i was surprised they were still there wenn i came to prepare some stuff and stayed during the evening.", "That\u2019s a control tactic, OP.  It\u2019s meant to box you and your boyfriend into letting certain people in.  You would only screw over yourself if you didn\u2019t pay for your wedding on your own without any help.", "I\u2019m not happy about it. I have less of a say in it, because it\u2019s at my mum\u2019s house.", "Ah, gotcha, that\u2019s different.  The staff at the pub should have announced closing time and shooed them out just like they would at the end of the night.", "Honestly I think it\u2019s mostly her following traditions. My mum\u2019s a lovely person, and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s doing it maliciously. I think she\u2019s just trying to help out. I understand what you\u2019re saying, though", "Well looking at it\u2026wedding financial support vs BP at mum\u2019s, looks like it\u2019s kind of even-stevens. From the outside ie others in your family and social circle it will looks weird and a bit shenaniganny and will damage the relationship your mother has with this person for what feels like a personal vendetta", "No kidding. I'd have asked the staff to make them leave, and if they didn't I would have demanded at least some my money back for the rental. I'm not paying to rent a place and then having strangers (other than working staff) in the space. That's not how renting space works. \n\nOf course, I'm in my 40s now and I probably wouldn't have had the gumption to do that at 18.", "Thing is, you say she\u2019s paying to help you and your boyfriend.  At the same time, she wants this second cousin of yours to be there when you don\u2019t.  I wonder who else she\u2019s planning on having there against your wishes\u2026", "You\u2019re making it sound as though I dislike her for literally no reason. She\u2019s a bad person who has bullied my mum in the past. My mum herself has said she doesn\u2019t know why she keeps in contact with her, and that she wishes she could tell her how she feels. Annie has ruined the relationship with my mum. Not me.", "  NTA, but I\u2019m curious; Are you engaged and actively planning your wedding? Or this just a theoretical discussion? The way your post is worded, this isn\u2019t a pressing issue.", "I can imagine from her point of view she just doesn\u2019t want to cause conflict. She\u2019s far too nice and forgiving, and will be there for people who don\u2019t deserve it out of familial obligation. I just wish she\u2019d have more respect for herself.", "But everything you\u2019ve said is not about this person\u2019s treatment of you but of your mother, who is choosing not to challenge her and wants to keep the status quo. You mention bullying, and I\u2019m wondering if she might feel a bit bullied by you on this. Do what you want, its your wedding as you say\u2026but I ascribe to the old saying\u2026kill people with kindness"]}
