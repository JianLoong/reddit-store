They'd told me they wanted to throw me one and asked if they should invite my ex. I said no because well no. We've agreed to co parent but we can and should keep some things separate if not necessary to include one another and this was just with my friends and family. So they threw me this baby shower and it was honestly quite some fun. It was all just jokes and bants. We had a great lunch, had some drinks, treats, and the gift giving. It was more of a celebratory party of me finally joining the parent club than anything. We took a bunch of funny parody type pictures of typical baby shower phtoshoots like one with my stomach out and my friends were feeling the 'baby' and one of me under baby shower banner with all the ballons and gifts etc. \n\nThese were obviously posted and my ex saw them and didn't like it, to say the least. She thinks I'm a dickhead for having a baby shower 1) at all because I refused to throw her one or help contribute and 2) without her since I'm not the one pregnant and apparently the photos were sexist and insulting.

I can\u2019t find it anywhere on google", "YTA. You say you want to co-parent, but this is the very first event involving your child and you are already fighting/not co parenting.

Imagine when your child grows up, and you show him/her pictures of the shower. What if he/she asks where their mommy is in the pictures? You will literally have to tell your child \u201cWell, even though it was a baby shower, it was really for me. So I didn\u2019t invite your mom, even though she was pregnant with you.\u201d You absolutely should\u2019ve invited her and had a co parent baby shower. If you felt you needed additional celebration for being a father, you should\u2019ve done something else (a barbecue, a vacation, a dinner, a brewery, etc.) aka you should\u2019ve done something that wasn\u2019t in the form of a baby shower. What makes me the most sad for your ex is, it sounds like nobody is throwing HER a shower. So she had to watch everyone throw you a baby shower, while her and the baby get nothing.", "Idk kinda. I think you did it more out of pettiness. She\u2019s the mother of your child, and having her there would be co parenting.

The purpose of a baby shower is to support the new parent and for your support network to help you out with purchasing items that will be necessary for raising your baby. Your baby is going to be raised in two separate homes, so I think it\u2019s great that your friends and family decided to rally around to support you as a single parent instead of just leaving you to figure it out by yourself. It\u2019s really touching actually because it shows they\u2019ll probably be there for you when the baby comes too. Of course your ex is in the picture as a co-parent and hopefully you can support each other well in that moving forward, but you are allowed to celebrate and prepare for your baby without her. It would be a vastly different story if you were still together. I\u2019m guessing her POV is that she should be celebrated for going through the pregnancy and childbirth and I can see where she is coming from in that. But I think if she had been invited to this shower she might also think she had a claim to whatever gifts your friends and family brought to help you prepare. It could have turned into a worse situation if she were invited.", "Oh, my dude, I am an old woman and am okay with getting downvoted. But such YTA....you have a \"parody\" shower.

Without the support of said child's father and his friends and their gifts....she gets....reads notes....nothing.   \n            But she gets to read about your exploits all over social media. How fun. I can't wait to see your parody labor photo shoot, your parody post partum shoot, your parody milk coming in shoot, your parody colic shoot.     It seems your taking this whole parenting thing super seriously.       You realize that this other human; the one carrying your child, is going to be in your life until you die, right? Not 18 years. Until. You. Die.       Weddings, graduations, visitations, illnesses, grandchildren, your partners are her business, her partners are yours.      This is not a great start. I hope someone got you a parenting book. I can recommend some. And maybe some counseling for you and your new life partner. Because she is a life partner. You can trivialize her, make fun of what's happening. But a human is coming. That human and human gestating deserve more respect.  Is she eating healthy, what are you doing to support her?

No offence but you don\u2019t really deserve a baby shower just because you\u2019ve got someone pregnant like yeah have a night out before you become a dad, but an entire baby shower and refusing to help your ex have one is quite shitty. She\u2019s carrying YOUR child and that\u2019s 9 months of her body going through so much trauma and you refusing to help with any kind of baby shower even as an ex is kind dickish. You\u2019ve got 9 months where you aren\u2019t even with her while she grows your child like I think she deserves something for that instead of you getting the baby shower when you\u2019re doing absolutely nothing for the kid till it\u2019s born.", "YTA from the post it sounds like she didn\u2019t get a baby shower so I totally get why it\u2019s insulting.

Stuff like this just leads to nitpicky tit for tat.", "In my opinion, I don\u2019t see any wrong doing but if she\u2019s petty you should be prepared to be excluded out of things like being in the delivery room, (she has the total say on that and you won\u2019t be able to do anything about it), the baby first doc appointments, she might not even call you or give you info on it, etc. Just tread lightly with her now that she feels \u201cexcluded\u201d.", "NTA also you guys will need 2 of everything anyway so she can have her own without you...women have done that forever", "**NTA**.

As others have said, this is not co-parenting. You really need to get all this animosity out of the way because it will affect the child.  It's not like she's giving birth and handing the kid to you to raise and walking away. She will be the child's mama for the rest if its life and if you're going to be the child's dada you need to get over whatever this is that's making you (and your whole family) treat the mama like shit.", "YTA You aren't the pregnant one.
