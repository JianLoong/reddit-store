So they threw me this baby shower and it was honestly quite some fun. It was all just jokes and bants. We had a great lunch, had some drinks, treats, and the gift giving. It was more of a celebratory party of me finally joining the parent club than anything.

You will literally have to tell your child \u201cWell, even though it was a baby shower, it was really for me. So I didn\u2019t invite your mom, even though she was pregnant with you.\u201d You absolutely should\u2019ve invited her and had a co parent baby shower. If you felt you needed additional celebration for being a father, you should\u2019ve done something else (a barbecue, a vacation, a dinner, a brewery, etc.) aka you should\u2019ve done something that wasn\u2019t in the form of a baby shower. What makes me the most sad for your ex is, it sounds like nobody is throwing HER a shower. So she had to watch everyone throw you a baby shower, while her and the baby get nothing.\n\nEDIT: Some of you are spending so much energy disagreeing with my comment/asking me questions.

The purpose of a baby shower is to support the new parent and for your support network to help you out with purchasing items that will be necessary for raising your baby. Your baby is going to be raised in two separate homes, so I think it\u2019s great that your friends and family decided to rally around to support you as a single parent instead of just leaving you to figure it out by yourself. It\u2019s really touching actually because it shows they\u2019ll probably be there for you when the baby comes too. Of course your ex is in the picture as a co-parent and hopefully you can support each other well in that moving forward, but you are allowed to celebrate and prepare for your baby without her. It would be a vastly different story if you were still together. I\u2019m guessing her POV is that she should be celebrated for going through the pregnancy and childbirth and I can see where she is coming from in that. But I think if she had been invited to this shower she might also think she had a claim to whatever gifts your friends and family brought to help you prepare.

It seems your taking this whole parenting thing super seriously.       You realize that this other human; the one carrying your child, is going to be in your life until you die, right? Not 18 years. Until. You. Die.       Weddings, graduations, visitations, illnesses, grandchildren, your partners are her business, her partners are yours.      This is not a great start. I hope someone got you a parenting book. I can recommend some. And maybe some counseling for you and your new life partner. Because she is a life partner. You can trivialize her, make fun of what's happening. But a human is coming. That human and human gestating deserve more respect.  Is she eating healthy, what are you doing to support her?

No offence but you don\u2019t really deserve a baby shower just because you\u2019ve got someone pregnant like yeah have a night out before you become a dad, but an entire baby shower and refusing to help your ex have one is quite shitty. She\u2019s carrying YOUR child and that\u2019s 9 months of her body going through so much trauma and you refusing to help with any kind of baby shower even as an ex is kind dickish.

Stuff like this just leads to nitpicky tit for tat.", "In my opinion, I don\u2019t see any wrong doing but if she\u2019s petty you should be prepared to be excluded out of things like being in the delivery room, (she has the total say on that and you won\u2019t be able to do anything about it), the baby first doc appointments, she might not even call you or give you info on it, etc. Just tread lightly with her now that she feels \u201cexcluded\u201d.", "NTA also you guys will need 2 of everything anyway so she can have her own without you...women have done that forever", "**NTA**.

I'm not saying that you won't do your part of the child raising, but at the same time, you should have invited her since this is yalls baby, and the gifts and celebration isn't just for you.

She's your ex, and I get that, but she is currently carrying your child, and what she does or does not have seriously affects how she can care for said child while it's in her custody.

Do what you can to make your child's mother less stressed, more comfortable, and happy. Because that is exactly what your child needs.\n\nTip: I suggest apologizing. And figuring out a way to make it right. As a sidenote, I don't know how involved she may want you to be, but the baby will be with her most of the time the first year at very least. Likely several. Courts won't give 50-50 as infants. Consider sending her money every month, tell her its for whatever she thinks she needs (vitamins, baby things). If you want to make amends and do want to get back together, check in every know and then and make it known that you want to be more involved. \n\nAlso, you are not entitled to anything while she is pregnant.

Look what a great job I did. Plus your mother, just no. I mean no offense, I love you I know you love her, but hey no\"......What the kid will answer...\"no comment\", or \"you are really a fuck up\"...who is suppose to be next to the baby mama during pregnancy and all the milestone in live of the kid (even if separated): the father, who is showing before the start that he is not up to the task: the father.

Your ex is 100% part of your life until you die OP. Your ex is one of the most important person in your kid life and ever will be. So yes your party was petty, you should have invite her or really if not, not make those pictures that your kid will resent you for in the future.

Right now the one suffering from the physical and mental challenges and who needs the most support is your ex, so I can see why it would upset her since you not only didn't help to throw a party to her but also prevented her presence in the one you got.

In all fairness, we lack a lot of context and information here - we do not know how and why they broke up. We don't know what their correspondent financial situations are. And here I find weird how many people in the comments blatantly ascribe greed and avarice to the ex. On the other hand, I keep getting the feeling she doesn't have people ready to organize a baby shower for her - but the OP doesn't really say that outright. We also don't know how their co-parenting situation is settled legally, and how easy it would be for him to extract himself from providing all but the bare minimum.\n\nIn the end, however, there are two places in the story that still make me feel that OP is a self-absorbed asshole.

Everything she is going to need, he is going to need.\n\nTherefore these items wouldn't be going to her, so why would she be there? \n\nI don't know, I'm married, and didn't have to deal with that. But I know what I did need as a parent. And if they are not living together, co-parenting. He's going to have the baby at times himself. This means he's going to need his own set of baby items to care for it.\n\nNTA", "They're separated. He's doing his own baby shower. She's free to do her own baby shower too. This isn't about the mom, it's about OP becoming a father. People take photos at baby showers. People share those photos on social media. Why do you think he isn't allowed to do this?\n\nThey're both going to be parents but they're not together anymore. They need to accept that they both have separate lives. They're both going to celebrate these types of things. He's going to get less time with the baby because he's not the mom. That isn't fair but that's the reality of the situation he is in. His friends and family wanted to throw him a baby shower. He agreed to it and didn't want his ex there. There is nothing wrong with that. \n\nIf it was reversed and she had the baby shower nobody would question it and she likely will have a baby shower that he isn't invited to. It's possible she already has. She'll probably share photos of it online too. \n\nIt sucks for OP and it sucks for his pregnant ex. I'm guessing she feels left out and that's fine but OP did nothing wrong. You make so many assumptions it's ridiculous. He's celebrating being a father. His friends and family are happy for him and giving him gifts. OP is NTA. \n\n>I understand that a future single father deserves a party with his friends and family, and a celebration of his parenthood.\n\nNo, you don't. You seem to think it's rude for him to celebrate this. His exes life, hopefully, didn't stop just because they broke up. She should be happy that the father of her baby is happy to be a parent and has supportive friends and family. Instead she's upset and that makes me wonder. Why, how, and when did they break up? How is she doing? Her reaction reeks of jealousy.\n\nYou and her both fail to realize something. OP is celebrating becoming a parent. This is about OP. \n\n>But calling his party 'a baby shower' as well, refusing to invite her, refusing to contribute to her party and 'parody photos' - all that taken together feel to be in extremely bad taste to me. I think she feels like OP, his friends and family are mocking her, and undervaluing what she is going though and is about to go through. And I think she would be right in that.\n\nYou don't like that they called it a baby shower? Really? What should it be called then? A dad shower? I've never heard of a \"mom shower\". I think you think dad should just stay home alone, have no friends, no life, and just support his child financially. I think you're undervaluing what he's about to go through. I suspect OP might be a good dad and unless mom really screws up and loses custody he will likely never get as much time with his child as he would like. \n\nI think this is two people that recently broke up and are having a child together.

She isn't his partner. She isn't his family. She isn't his friend. There's no reason she should be there to celebrate him or him becoming a father.
