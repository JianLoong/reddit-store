It\u2019s bullying by the living lying about the dead", "I feel like allowing them to use \u201cBaby Mayo\u201d as a nickname is a reasonable compromise, and almost kinda cute. No way I\u2019d put it in a birth certificate though!", "Do not do the middle name either. His family will then use it as her name because \u201ctraditions\u201d.", "I agree. If they're this nuts and controlling over a name, there's plenty more crazy to come. Avoid this toxic B.S. I'd quietly and immediately head for the airport. Don't tell anyone until you're gone. You will never get a say in your child's life if you stay. You are now a part of the Borg.", "You married a dude who prioritizes his family over you.

Ketchup/Mustard/Marmalade are great pet names, not so much human names. I really sympathise with you", "Yea, if someone is close to their family, never, ever marry them without KNOWING their family.", "Telling them anything might be a problem, unless OP moves back before giving birth.
