Maybe it's an overreaction, but I wouldn't want this to be my life. FYI to OP, if your child is born in this country, that's it, you're stuck there. Jurisdiction for custody purposes is going to lie in the country your baby is born in - generally, and especially if that country is the US and likely any European nation.", "It's probably a \"family matriarch\" role so the great grandmother. Just the oldest woman in the line.", "I asked him when he first explained it to me and he says it will be his Great Aunt who is her eldest living daughter, she was the third but the oldest and second died.\nThis Great Aunt is the most insistent on this name.", "It's not a name, it's a condiment and I don't even want it to used as a middle name. I don't think it can be an appropriate name for a person.", "I don't think it's appropriate for a middle name. Since his family tradition is such I don't know of any legal restrictions.", "My Husband's great aunt is the next in line apparently, she is the most firm on this being the only name acceptable.", "She did, all living family members have been named this way as far as I was told. I didn't necessarily think anything of his name when we met and it didn't come up in conversation before this event  but it isn't what I would have thought as common. I didn't know most of his families names but some are what I thought of as strange or a bit funny. I don't personally think any are as bad as this one though. His Great Aunt and her siblings had normalisssh names and I have heard of before. I thought his Mum's name was unique But some of the younger family members names were definitely taking me by surprise when I first met them.", "Fight tradition with tradition.\n\nIt\u2019s my families tradition to let the parents decide on their child\u2019s name without input from other members of the family. You know, to stop jealousy between the maternal and paternal family AS great Uncle Edgar would also like a go. So to avoid conflict as my family feels very strong about this, I must decline.\n\nNTA", "IMHO that was an unimprovable response. \n\nIt reads like your husband blindsided you quite deliberately hoping you'd cave to pressure.", "OP, I'm more concerned that you are married to someone who isn't your partner. He's just doing his thing, with his family, with you along for HIS ride.\n\nYou live in the country HE wants to live in. He expects you to follow the traditions of HIS family - no discussion. I don't think that pattern is going to end any time soon.\n\nAs for the baby's name - the top reply to this comment of yours is great: tell them it is YOUR family tradition for the parents (you and your husband) to name their own child.", "NTA.  What I would do in this case is you & hubby decide on a name. Tell hubby to not tell anyone. After the baby is born, tell family that when you saw his/her face for the first time, you instantly knew the name should be X. \n\nI feel if you tell them beforehand, it will be a constant battle until you give birth.", "Tradition is bullying by dead people. Point out you will name your child not an lovely elderly person who if she still had all her mental facilities would be appalled at the name elderly person chose. \nMore so since you were not told about a rule , labeled tradition before deciding to have children. This tradition should have been mentioned when discussing marriage.  This is not something you agreed to do, this is your child in your body other people don\u2019t decide the name. If name not too outlandish you could use as a middle name. Congratulations on your baby.", "Involuntary or not, we all felt that. \ud83d\ude02", "NTA but be prepared, because it sounds like whether or not you give your child a different name your in laws will still call it the name the grandmother said.", "Baby names take 2 yes's. If you're not on board, then you need to come up with a name you both agree on. What is with people and baby naming \"traditions?\" NTA", "NO ONE, absolutely NO ONE has the right to name ANY baby, they didn't explicitly make. \nIf they wanted baby named Jam, and you named baby Banana Bread. As the person growing the baby, THAT IS YOUR CHOICE. Name baby a name you love. Everyone else can get on board, or be left behind.", "Your baby, your choice", "I see your point. \n\nMaybe you could call foul or get off the hook on a technicality? This is a really terrible tradition if Grandma does not know what\u2019s going on anymore. For all anyone knows she may have been naming you.\n\nEdit", "Oh it most definitely would be harder. Then you would be disrespecting her memory/legacy. But along w everyone else, I agree you need to shut this down pronto. NTA and congrats!!", "Then you need to grow a spine. It will be you and hubby at the registry office to complete the registration so decide what name YOU both are happy with and go with that.", "Everyone is going to say that if it\u2019s not their baby that\u2019s going to have to live with the name Fruit Salad.", "Well you can give away the name to them, then they can name their child baby \"thousand island dressing\".", "Look for a compromise here. You are living in his country and will be around his family for quite some time, as will your child. Talk in depth multiple times to your husband. One option - the \u201cdonated\u201d name could be the middle name, and you and your husband give the first name.", "I think your family tradition is that the parents get to chose their own baby\u2019s name.", "Dementia-Addled Oracle sounds like an early 2000s pop-punk band name.", "Glad I've not offended you with that comment, I really didn't know how to phrase it without sounding a bit unhinged - as said, most likely not a cult but definitely kinda creepy to someone who's not used to big or close families I guess", "I don't think I would even want it as a middle name. My parents weren't one for nicknames and I don't think it's even pleasant to be called this as a nickname. \nI didn't know what was happening at first and genuinely thought she had just been requesting the condiment in question especially as all the gatherings involve food but then I was quickly found out that was a wrong assumption. Who knows what she meant but I don't know if it would even matter to the rest of the family at this point if she really means for this to be the babies name.", "F**k that.....time for a new tradition..\"Lets not have an ancient person name out child\"", "Curious, is it a foreign word that sounds like a condiment in your language or is it actually a condiment in their language?", "In which country will the kid be born, his or yours or a third?", "Do none of them seriously see the issue with this name?  Are they all crazy?  Senile?  Fed a diet of lead paint chips their whole lives?", "Of course she is.. she knows her turn is coming soon and doesn't want to give up her power.", "Please please please tell us the real condiment \"name\"...", "You are a genius", "Can't be stated better", "Hubby will immediately tell his family and they will shut her down.  HIS family is the only ones that count don\u2019t you know?", ">Tradition is bullying by dead people.\n\nOMG I love this. I'm going to remember it for the future. :)", "I literally thought \"fuck that noise\" as I was reading it lol", "The name marmalade is a low key lit name... for a cat", "What a fine family tradition!", "Love it!", "I\u2019ve read so many comments and I just keep thinking \u201cNana wants to name the baby ketchup, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d So please tell me ketchup isn\u2019t the name or I will cry.", "I mean I'm fairly certain it is just a condiment. I don't think there is a name I can see googling that is similar enough to be mixed up and my husband hasn't mentioned it as being an actual name.", "I wonder if she is now questioning moving to his country.  I would be. I would tell them she will move back if they push it. I wonder how many of hubby's family have kids with names they absolutely hate.", "EXACTLY! Lol", "Did you get cult vibes from it? Lol", "Marmalade the orange kitty is a fantastic name. Marmalade an actual, human child of currently unknown gender? Not cool at all."]}
