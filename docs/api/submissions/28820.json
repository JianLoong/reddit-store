I don't think your bf is an asshole either -- *up until the point he acted passive-aggressively*. You talked about what happened, which I assume means that he was aware you were stressed, anxious, and disappointed. It's possible he assumed he had given you what you needed -- his time, attention, and concern -- and that he was hoping to connect after being away and driving a long time.\n\nHOWEVER, if he wanted your time and attention, he should have used his big-boy words to check in with you and see what you were up for in terms of connection just the two of you (cuddling in bed perhaps?) Versus just go to sleep and act passive-aggressive the next day. It would have been so easy to just ask you if you were okay with being held in bed for a few minutes and just being present with each other in a really tough time.", "You were supposed to fuck him obviously.

He was an insensitive jerk. He wanted you to be happy and cheerful and focusing your attention solely on him. Maybe on daily basis you give him more attention. And the only day you had other prios, he decided that he has a right to feel \"abandoned\".\nOn the other hand it would be good to communicate (if you haven't done that) that you keep everything inside during stressful situations, and don't feel like interacting. That this is your response to stress that he should be aware of. \nSometimes even obvious things have to be clearly communicated.", "This will be pulled by the mods, but NTA. Priorities, dude. Jesus.", "NTA - If he needs to be \"wanted, needed, desired\" he needs to speak up about these things. You're not a mind reader, in addition to the fact of the stressful things going on with your child.", "It sounds like he is very self centered, selfish and needy. Not a good look. Big Red Flag.

What a tool.", "NTA what is he? FIFTEEN?", "NTA. Hes immature and selfish. 50 years old and he still acts like a teenager? That's the thing, he sees you as a supply of attention and when you don't give it he gets upset. It doesn't matter what ur doing thru, he doesn't truly care. It's narcissistic. Also he's not being supportive at all. Relationships go through dry spells, months of distance due to life. Its about how you support each other and come together during and after those times that define the relationship and trust and love. He doesn't understand that. If something bad happens to you God forbid and you needed weeks to be alone and grieve, he would 100% make it about him and he would most likely cheat or leave you.", "NTA.. he is being immature.  However he may still learning how to communicate his feelings. He went about it wrong-running away to punish you and then complaining later. He needs to talk about things in the moment and also realize it's not all about him. At the tender age of 50 you have to wonder if he wants to learn or change.", "This ticks some psyco- and sociopathic traits boxes.", "Right!? Or he could just have ASKED when she was zoned out!

It's been a few days and I've missed you and I'm so glad I can spend time with you, even though I can't take this stress away from you. Would it be okay if I held you for a bit and just have us be here together?\"\n\nI can't speak for OP but something like that would definitely make me put down phone in a heartbeat and feel seen and cared for with that.", "Your child may be suffering a potentially scholarship/career-ending injury and he wants to feel \u201cwanted, needed, desired\u201d? \n\nGet the heck outta here. NTA. You\u2019re focusing on your kid\u2019s health. Don\u2019t think you need to drop everything for this jerky dude.", "Recently my kid was sick, my partner and I were not sleeping well that week and we\u2019re running on E. One evening I was doom scrolling on my phone and he politely said \u201cI know we\u2019re tired but if it\u2019s ok I\u2019d love to connect with you right now without phones- do you just want to talk?\u201d. I was happy to do that, put my phone down, we snuggled and talked. Your partner is 50 why is he going to give you an evening of cold shoulder then leave to text his issue rather than directly communicate? NTA", "NTA, not at all. Your boyfriend is *incredibly* selfish to be making this about him when your kid is going through such a significant injury. \n\nI'm just 1 year out from surgery for the same injury (minus the break), and it was honestly the worst pain I have ever felt in my life - including the time I shattered my elbow and upper arm. It's insane your boyfriend wanted you to focus on him when you know your kid is in so much pain. Not to mention losing out on their senior season, which had to also be emotionally devastating as well as having an impact on potential college scholarships. \n\nYour boyfriend's lack compassion for you and your kid in this is very concerning. As your partner, who presumably knows your kid, shouldn't he also be worried about *them* too? Not throwing a petty temper tantrum because you're honestly distracted and worried. I'd throw the whole man out and focus on your kid.\n\nI'm so sorry your kid is going through this. It sucks. I wish them an easy surgery, speedy recovery, and an excellent team of physical therapists. Also, if you haven't, you might want to get a water circulator device for your child's leg. A friend lent me theirs and it was a lifesaver with how much it helped with the pain. I wore that thing 24/7 for months.", "50 year old man makes comment that makes him sound like a teenager.

Sometimes they are 20-80, sometimes 40-60, sometimes 10-90.  Looking at each of your situations, sounds like you had the far more stressful day (child facing surgery and possible loss of some future dreams) while he had to drive a few hours.", "You are not the AH but I will say you were dismissive. Just because he's being selfish doesn't mean his feelings aren't valid. This is a hard point in a relationship where a situation will compromise your wants and needs and those of your partner. Does your daughter's health take priority?! Absolutely. Can an injured or ailing child put a strain on a relationship? Absolutely. He's telling you he's feeling that and you can either decide it's worth talking about or it's not, but if it's not he might leave. You might be ok with that because that might not be the person you want. \nAlso, this isn't even a case of \"well if it were me I'd feel...\" Because we don't know and that's just a projection of your own view on their situation. This is tricky, a bit unfair, but when you have this situation with a child vs relationship, extra work has to be done by the BOTH of you. You'll have to make sure he's getting attention, and he'll have to learn patience and even show you a little more attention.", "Yta for not communicating.", "NTA\n\nIf he had needs he should communicate them and not expect you to read his mind.  Just as you should communicate any needs for support.  \n\nHe's also a parent.  He should at least be sympathetic to the fact that seeing your child hurt and injured is really hard and default to asking you what you need and how he can support you and your daughter.", "NTA \n\nHe was being selfish thinking of his \u201cneeds\u201d and not your feelings or your child\u2019s. \n\nLeave this relationship, this is a huge red flag.", "NTA. I'd drop someone IMMEDIATELY if they did this to me. And you had literally just taken a shower together. It's just... wow.", "NTA dump him.", "**NTA**;  he could have read the room or asked if he noticed your focus was elsewhere.

He's more worried about his little teenage feelings, that aren't being validated by you, and then makes it all your fault. Um No! That's not how adulting works. If I were him, I would be more concerned about you being zoned out because I would know that you are stuck in your own head with worry and need someone to just be there.  Take him at the childish man is he is being, and nope out. You are NTA.", "NTA. He\u2019s being childish. Ofcourse your child comes first when they\u2019re seriously injured.

Please do not ignore.", "He must be very oblivious to not realise that sex was probably the last thing on OP's mind when her daughter was that injured.", "Her leg was cold to the touch? That's maybe a leg ending injury.", "What you said is fundamentally contradictory. If the child\u2019s health takes priority, than there is no need to compromise.\n\nFurthermore, his feelings are valid, his reaction to them absolutely is not. He is not the center of the universe and OP is not the asshole for not paying attention to him when her child is in the hospital. To put it frankly, he\u2019s an adult, and he needs to deal with his emotions himself.\n\nI absolutely agree that a fundamental part of a relationship is giving attention to your partner. But no, that doesn\u2019t mean all the time. Your partner needs to be able to be alone and not make that your problem.", "And he\u2019s 50! This is some 19 year old bs. He could have also used his words in person instead of pouting like a child.", "You're absolutely correct, the child's health takes priority. As I said, this causes strain in a relationship and it makes us have to do extra to make sure we're on the same page with our partner. Even if that means coming together to prioritize the child. It's a discussion that needs to happen. Compromise doesn't mean the child gets pushed second to the relationship. It means the partners check in with each other openly and honestly. It's that extra effort, especially because they're clearly not on the same page. For her it's obvious the child is priority at this time and he should be understanding. For him, he probably understands that but is feeling neglected at the same time. Which is, yes, selfish and he should be understanding but I'm never a fan of someone being punished for being honest about their emotional needs, especially men. Not saying they should be catered to, but there can be a discussion here if the relationship is important. I just think it's sometimes a cop out to say \"he's selfish, red flag, drop him\".", "Umm no way. I have a 19 yo and he wouldn\u2019t pull this shit. This is some middle grade bs.", "I honestly think you\u2019re giving the guy way too much credit. Credit not found in the post. He\u2019s not getting punished for \u201cexpressing his emotional needs.\u201d He was asking that op put his emotional needs ahead of their own.\n\nLike You said, he\u2019s being selfish. And his punishment for being selfish was being called selfish. The problem isn\u2019t that they aren\u2019t on the same page, the problem is that he\u2019s trying to make the page about him when it just isn\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019m not even saying that he shouldn\u2019t express his emotions. Even his selfish ones. I\u2019m saying that he thinks he should be the priority when clearly he shouldn\u2019t. They could absolutely have a conversation about his needs after the child is on the mend.\n\nBecause ultimately, it\u2019s his responsibility to take care of his own emotional needs. And there\u2019s absolutely room for nuance in a relationship, but he should be able to handle not feeling \u201cwanted, needed, desired\u201d without blaming someone else.", "I'm really trying not to give him too much credit. More like I'm trying to impress upon the fact that there is a strain in the relationship that should be addressed. That's all.", "NTA. I would\u2019ve dumped him on the spot, good lord.", "NTA. This reminds me a little of a story I read where the OP's 10 year old son was missing for two days. Naturally she was frantic with worry and terror, spending every waking moment looking for him, on her phone or at the police station, etc. She was dumbfounded when her boyfriend suddenly screamed at her \"Will you stop ignoring me?!?\".
