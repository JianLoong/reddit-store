THEY refused.", "NTA and ya'll should probably have a talk with S about how she handles herself when she's drunk.

It easily could have been brought in or something could have been eaten that's already at your home.", "NTA you didn't leave them stranded. They have phones and can order an uber themselves. S was coherent enough to order food this is on her.", "NTA. You didn't abandon them, they refused to leave. After waiting for fast food for so long that the first Uber left, 15 minutes pass, you order another Uber, and that Uber arrives.", "NTA. \n\nBut hop onto Uber and give this guy a great review, particularly stating that he was extremely patient with a drunk and unruly passenger.", "Nope... NtA.. but is this worth it? These women sound exhausting to deal with. You're not just catering to your gf but also her demanding sister? \n\nYou did not leave them stranded, they had multiple options to get home but your gf kept choosing to put her DRUNK sisters demands above common sense. That was her choice and she dragged you into it with her..", "NTA. I would have left with the first uber driver if I was in your place.", "NTA\n\nThey are not worth the time if they're going to call you an abuser for not wanting to sit in the cold. Did S even have her food by the time you came back? You were already waiting 15 minutes plus the time it takes to order an uber and do the drive twice to your home. Neither of the 2 respect you or your time. You gave them the option to ride back with you and they chose fast food that can be ordered or im assuming you had food at the house.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like you just disappeared. You told them and they decided to stay. Don\u2019t hang out with your gfs sister when she drinks", "NTA. You're not responsible for fellow adults' behavior just because they're women.\n\nS chose to get drunk and belligerent, and your GF chose to enable that - oopsie!

Then when things still aren't happening you called for your own ride and left. They are adults who made their decisions. They cannot expect to just go where ever they please and you will tag along to protect them just because you are a man.", "NTA these two sound so exhausting.

It's not your job to babysit two drunks who know it's time to leave and who refuse. They can yabbit all they want about being female and entitled to protection, however that privilege doesn't give them the right to jerk their protector around.

You made a choice for your health and offered them to come with, they refused because take out was more important (again, they could have ordered in or made something at home). \n\nYou even came back instead of just continuing home. Thats not abusive behavior imo, coming from someone who was in an abusive relationship for a year.", "Having boundaries isn't abusive. Your sister and her friend were pushing your boundaries by trying to make you wait while they fiddled about. You called them on it, their shenanigans cost you the first Uber, and they refused to come along when the second one arrived. By focusing on the your response to this very inappropriate flex, they are trying to redirect attention from their behavior.", "So the other reply already covered how you are def not an abuser, but I feel it's important to point out that your girlfriend is doing at least emotional abuse. She's gaslighting you into thinking that you've maybe done wrong, she's guilt tripping you for trying to take care of your own health and inviting her to come with you-\n\nI went through thirteen years of that shit with my childhood best friend. It's not okay. Don't let her make you into a bad guy, just because you are a guy. If you were a girl, they may still have called you out on it, but no one would consider you an abuser for going home for your own wellbeing. (Please note this is coming from a person who has as previously stater experienced long term emotional abuse as well as from an AFAB person who has experienced sexual assault and abuse from men, this isn't some incel women don't trust men because they hate men thing, this is a these women are taking advantage of the fact that they are in a different societal position than you to make it seem like you are a bad person. Yes you would be more aware of how scary it is to be out after dark if you were a woman - though I'm only now realizing that that is an assumption of mine and since I'm on mobile I can't check so if you are female, my bad, extra-)NTA.", "I mean no one was *abusive* here but if anyone was abusing someone it was S abusing that poor Uber driver", "It's a good one.
