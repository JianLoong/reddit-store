You're not being mean, however you guys should have a calm conversation about it outside of a moment when it happens, so you can explain why this is so bothersome.", "NTA. My daughter is a Celiac sufferer, so I know how expensive GF food is. It's not just a choice, it is medically necessary. Since it became a \"fad\" to be gluten free, the general public has dismissed how serious the disease is. Gluten isn't just a food thing; it's in shampoo, other cosmetics, glue, play dough, and a lot of other things people don't think twice about using.\n\nIf he wants to eat the food that you need to eat to keep yourself safe, then he can buy it. You are not selfish. Your choices are severely limited in so many ways, so enjoy those special treats you know won't make you sick.", "NTA - You need special food that is harder to get and more expensive. He can go to any store and buy inexpensive snacks or treats. You cannot do the same. The food that you are getting isn't expensive or hard to find because it is \"special\" or \"better\". The normal concept of sharing does not apply.", "NTA.  I'm saying this based on the fact that, since he's your fiance, I'm assuming that he knows how important your gluten free food is to you, and he's probably aware of how expensive it is.\n\nAlso, your title makes it sound like you are some animal in the wild guarding your food from other predator's. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "NTA from one coelic to another. It can be so frustrating to have to pay so much more and have to go to a store we wouldn't usually or buy online. Even in the UK I have trouble getting hold of some things and have to order online which requires postage costs and minimum order costs etc. My husband would never touch my special gluten free snacks unless offered, let alone demand something.\n\nThe only situation where it would have been ok for him to demand more if he said \"I'll buy you another pack tomorrow\" and he put the effort and cost into going out and finding a specialist food rather than you.", "NTA.  Special foods such as gluten free or dairy free can be very expensive.  Maybe you could have worded it better to him, but NTA for not sharing.", "NTA but when watching a movie was the absolute wrong time for a taste test.", "NTA he can buy his own damn snacks", "Does your fianc\u00e9 buy gluten free products just so he could share them with you often? If he does, then your outburst doesn't look too good. But I honestly don't believe, that he does.\nI had many allergies at some point of my life. Lucky for me, they passed. When I still couldn't eat too many products, I have been very protective of my own food. Just logically thinking: bread, that I could eat was only in one shop in the town  (30min away by bus) and was 5 times more expensive, while anyone elses bread was 2 minutes away. Is it really reasonable to ask for my bread, instead of eating your own? \nI did learn to protect my food by being hungry. Amount of people, who thought \"it's just food\" and didn't see, that they do have alternatives, when it runs out and I don't was big, but that is their problem. The same people never went out of their way to prepare ANYTHING I could eat. Many bday parties I had to sit whole evening while staring at other people eating and pretending, that I am ok with it.\nMy allergies went away and so my attitude towards sharing food changed. Now I don't mind sharing, because if I run out, I can go to the nearest shop and get more for reasonable price. I also know, that now those people do share stuff with me. But I would never ask celiac person to share their stuff with me if I wouldn't be able to give sth in return.\nSo to conclude, NTA from me. Your food, your rules. If he liked it so much, he can buy it for himself next time.", "This is kinda tough, as I am also gluten free and I share all the time. In fact I welcome people asking because people assume gluten free food is bad, so I try to prove them wrong.\n\nHowever, it sounds like you are on a tight budget and GF food is stupidly expensive, so sharing would leave you with reduced options in general, while a non-celiac can have whatever. So your feelings are understandable.  For that reason, I'll go with NTA... except you were an A the way you went about it.", "NTA. He's being a dick. That's it.", "NTA\n\nIt would be nice to have some snacks for him as well though when you are watching a movie together.", "Nah just be kinder in the future \"I understand your curiosity but these are my safe foods.

I thimk it's fine to have your own food, but you can be nicer about it.", "Does he share in the grocery bills?  Is he willing to?  Did you ask?  Maybe I am old fashioned but when I eat someone's food, I generally will happily reciprocate or replenish it at whatever cost.  It's just what you do.  Far be it from me to judge the quirks of your relationship, god knows I have my own, but food is an essential, if you cannot share food as a basic building block of the relationship, that's not good....  I understand the ridiculous cost, especially now in the states, but the social implications of what you did are kind of scary in regard to the depth of your relationship, particularly if you don't know his willingness to contribute.  I have my own celiac in my life, and as a result some of the things in my house have changed to accommodate that person (not a regular character in my home, but there frequently enough).  I do this so that they feel welcome, and comfortable.  Guests should always feel welcome, particularly romantic ones.   Sorry, in this case YTA.", "Nta exclusive his fine\n\nHis reaction sucks.  Why do girls keep wanting to marry assholes", "YTA\n\nYou acknowledged that this has been an issue in the past, and realize that you could have been nicer about how you said things to your fianc\u00e9. Just because you have valid reasoning for your actions doesn't make you not an AH.\n\nDoes your fianc\u00e9 fully realize the extent of your disease / the cost of your food?

I get that being your first instinct but an I don't share and this is why is more reasonable. To clarify, not sharing is completely reasonable. Don't feel guilty for all the times you didn't share the one thing you could eat with someone who had multiple options.
