Initially, I recall my mum saying they\u2019d allow me to stay there for as long as I needed. They eventually had to sell it as their finances were stretched and they had debts to pay.

Why would they want to cram so many people in 1 house for no reason? \nAlso, the situation changed for you and your parents. They allowed you to live rent free to help you out. You began renovating as if you were going to stay there forever? \nNo they have several family members in need?", "YTA. \n\nThey let you live in their house rent free, they didn't \"give it\" to you. Maybe the time and money you spent on the house is a nice way to thank them FOR LIVING RENT FREE IN THEIR HOUSE. \n\nYour sister also needs help and you'd rather help a person you barely know? You can't understand how your parents might want your sister's family in their extra house instead of living with them every day? One adult is a lot easier to live with than a whole family with a young child, but did you think about their needs at all? Of course not. You're just engaged in a competition with your sister to see who can get the most out of them.  \n\n\n>They kept making out my sister's situation to be nearly as bad as Olha's.\n\nYour sister is their daughter! You are living in their home and being asked to pay nothing. You are creating a potentially HUGE liability for them by inviting someone else to live rent-free in their home, presumably without a lease. Obviously you know how complicated it is to evict someone from a property since you threatened your own parents with that.\n\nSounds like you're the one who is \"incredibly spoiled.\" It is your parents' house. Your claims that they gave it to you are ridiculous and putting your parents in the position of legally having to evict you has the potential to ruin the relationship with your whole family for the rest of your life. \n\nYou're very lucky that your parents are so generous and reasonable. I'd love to hear their side.", "YTA. You're acting entitled and wondering why your sister acts entitled. \"Not as bad\" does not equal \"good.\" \n\nDoes your situation suck? Yes. \n\nAre you asserting rights you do not have? Yes. \n\nYou're just making things worse. Negotiate knowing that the single, older sibling will often get less than the married, younger sibling.

She\u2019s barely settled and beginning to heal. They could give her a timeline if sisters not figured something out in a few months, but it\u2019s incredibly disrespectful to do so.

I have no idea why you spent your money renovating a place that isn't in your name, but that was your choice, and doesn't further entitle you to the house in any way. and your promise to Olha was nice, but from your own post it doesn't even sound like Olha particularly wants to live there. you can't hold your promise to Olha over your parents head, because it's literally not your place to offer up the home to someone else. of COURSE your parents will prioritize their own flesh and blood over a friend you made. it honestly sounds like you brought up the whole Olha thing to make your parents feel bad about asking you to leave and you're mad and calling them \"un-Christian\" when it didn't work. \n\nit makes way more sense for your sisters family to take the house, you are just one person vs their three. your BIL doesn't have a job right now, his savings will be eaten up by living expenses, it makes no sense for them to buy a new property when your parents have one that they have every right to offer up. you stomping your feet and saying \"fine, evict me then\" is just manipulating your parents kindness, you know that they don't want to evict you because that will be terrible for your credit and rent history. I don't buy that your sister is the golden child at all, you just sound massively entitled. if you don't want to move into your parents house just buy your own, isn't that what you suggest your BIL does?", "NTA \n\nTell them to take you to court and make you whole for the money you put in and go NC.

Everyone is forgetting she took a run down property that parents said she could stay as long as she needed so she made it her home. If it was still run down do you think the parents would tell her to give it up or the sister and her family want to live there? It's not that it's their property but that the parents said go ahead and stay there forever so she feels she could safely do what she wanted (make it livable and her home)\n\nIt almost feels like the parents knew that no one would live there in the previous condition and let her make the home liveable so they could just take it back. I think most people are missing this point.", "So your parents want to provide both of you with rent free housing? And y'all are fighting?", "You don\u2019t need judgement.

It sucks, I know, you probably have attached yourself to the new normal and the house but it\u2019s legally theirs. I don\u2019t think they do it out of preference or favorism either. It\u2019s logical step in their mind - 3 people make more sense in a house than just one. I now Olha has been probably a support for you but for them she is a stranger. What they don\u2019t consider, is that any new changes for you are enormously hard, and that the house means something to you. But holding on to it now will only make things worse for you, cause a drift in the family that will be just more exhausting later. Whether it\u2019s fair or not is not important now. I don\u2019t think fighting for the house will do you any favors. (I could also see that your sister and her husband don\u2019t have nearly as much money as they say or seem to have too).\n\nMove out, I would even consider moving in with your parents to not be completely alone (but you know your relationship the best) and start therapy if you haven\u2019t yet. Don\u2019t hesitate to visit your doctor if things get worse for you. \n\nWish you better days soon.", "NTA. all of this \"legally\" stuff is so annoying. this isn't legal advice. it's \"are you being an asshole\" and you're not. sure, legally you don't have a claim. but your parents are going back on their word and it's okay and normal to push back against having your home (yes, if you live there it's your home) yanked out from under you.", "YTA you seem like the folden child", "NTA\n\nI'm trying to imagine this if this would happen in my family and I would do the same as you. I'm not entitled to anything, but if my parent told me I can stay as long as I want after the death of a loved one, and not even a year later my older sibling with a kid and more money wanted the property... No just no. Legally? Sure, they are in their right, but morally? My sibling isn't entitled to anything either.", "NTA I had a similar situation with my dad. After I spent a few months and a few thousand in repairs, I was asked to move out. But my dad wasn't an AH. He paid me back. Unfortunately, despite not being NTA, you will probably not win this one. Legally they have the upper hand. I'm sorry, but life sucks sometimes. Hopefully you'll get on your feet soon and get away from these toxic people.", "NTA but this is why I quickly got out on my own after HS graduation. Anytime you rely on family for something, they can (will?) hold it over your head. I just don\u2019t have the time or patience for that. I would advise not letting them have something to hold over your head as soon as you can.", "Your not an asshole.. but legally they can toss you off the property anytime.  It sucks that you've put so much time and effort into the house, but its time to find somewhere else to live.  Either that or you ask if they'll sell the property to you, and with that money they can do whatever they want for your sister.\n\nIts a bad situation but if you really want to continue with the drama its your prerogative . Personally the moment they told me \"Its our property, we can do what we want\"  I'd have started making plans to move.  If you really want to piss them off.. when you leave take with you as much of the building as you put into it. Tell them if that's how they want to do things, you'll leave it in the same condition you found it.", "NTA, but you need to move out.

You've been through a lot in a short amount of time and it's understandable that this request, logical as it may be, is a slap in the face and in direct contradiction to your original agreement. \n\nThat being said, I would be looking for other living arrangements so you can have stability in your life and not be at the mercy of other people. I'd also be going LC/NC after that awful last text from your mother once you've relocated.", "NTA, unfortunately the truth is that they legally own the property and they can bully you out of your current home. You can also go the legal route and simply refuse to move forcing them to serve you with an eviction notice and whatnot. \n\nI'm sorry that your family is unreliable and that must feel like a real betrayal.", "NTA, but unfortunately it is your parents\u2019 property. It is not fair for them to ask this of you, given that this has been your home and you\u2019ve fixed it up during your time there, but life isn\u2019t fair. It was good of them to be there for you in your time of need, but pulling the rug out is pretty crappy.  I personally would move out and move away from family. Reconsider how much I want them in your life if you feel they don\u2019t value your relationship. Think about the situation clearly while not in it.", "NTA. Your BIL is facing the consequences of his own actions and I don\u2019t think you should have to suffer for that. Legally, you have to do what your parents say unfortunately. If either uninstall the renovations or ask for reimbursement. I\u2019d recommend moving far away from these people though, they obviously don\u2019t care for you as much as they do your sister.

Your parents obviously think your sister and her daughter can do no wrong and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they suggested she move in with them but she said she wanted the property. Usually the golden child wants what the others have.\nYour parents gave you their word and took it back the second the sister wanted it so I can see why you\u2019re upset. Honestly I would try and get on my feet as soon as possible and then have low-contact with all of them but your brothers. Your parents will always put whatever your sister wants above what you want/need and they have proved that. Your sister sounds like a B and just wants whatever you get from your parents so I would cut contact with her and her family if you\u2019re not getting anything out of the relationship. Family is tricky but if they do not give in the relationship and take and hurt you mentally  and emotionally, it\u2019s time to find your real family that\u2019s not blood.", "I would stay there till I get evicted.

Grief is difficult, and it sounds like you have suffered a lot. That said, your parents are being very logical and reasonable regarding who should now live in the property they own. The swap is a very good deal. Unfortunately, you appear to be too mired in grief, resentment, and other strong feelings to understand that. I have read your comments - in some ways, I actually understand what your mom is trying to say about Olha. You appear to have an unusually strong attachment to her - perhaps it\u2019s not romantic, but there is something there that\u2019s pretty intense. Olha, however, does NOT appear to have the same attachment to you. My concern is that you may be trying to \u201csave\u201d Olha when you couldn\u2019t save your bf. Olha does not seem very receptive to that. My advice is to agree to the swap so you can save money to eventually get your own place and so that you can get grief counseling and/or therapy for the myriad of feelings you are experiencing now and in the past towards your bf\u2019s death, the situation with Olha, your family dynamic, and your relationship with your sister.", "YTA you don\u2019t legally own the property, your repairs/fixes could be considered rent equivalents (if you haven\u2019t been paying them rent, which you should have at least nominally).

Unless there was a \"fix up house to cover rent\" agreement, I would just put everything back the way it was and look for an apartment somewhere. Im sorry your parents are changing the rules mid game on you but since its their property, they kinda can and it sucks especially since it sounds like sis and bil can afford literally any other property.

The only one in any sort of hardship, who _can't_ afford to buy a house, is OP.\n\nWhich is why you are wrong and she is NTA.", "... food banks mostly give the same amount of food to 1 person than to 5, yes. The only situation I've seen food banks where I live give more to a family is if said family has a small children that may need specific foods or other items (like baby food, milk, formula, or diapers), and the only extra they get is exactly those specific thibgs they may need.\n\nAlso, OP said the BIL lost his job after his boss fled the country for various illegal things he did and they had to abruptly move. I doubt they can buy the house.", "My parents made it very clear I could stay in the house for at least a year before. \n \nMy sister is open they could afford to get their own place and how much (broadly) they have in cash - it just \"doesn't make sense to them to waste money when there's a perfectly fine house they could stay at and her husband's future prospects are uncertain", "The sister's family has plenty of space. They have separate bedrooms & access to the common areas of the house. The only difference is that the parents live there also. Which is even better since the grandparents can babysit while these 2 adults go out & work & hustle to get their *own* home, rather than swooping in to take over a place that's already occupied.", "The youngest daughter doesn\u2019t need the help. Her and her husband are wealthy. \n\nWhy does a wealthy family need a free house?", "You cannot retroactively charge rent. Rent is an agreed upon amount going forward, if someone says you can live here for no money, or $200 a month then decide nope it is worth $500 a month you can only charge $500 going forward not retroactively. \n\nOP made improvements to the property under the agreement they would live there for the foreseeable future and is now being told they can't live there anymore. So OP is allowed to take things back. \n\nThe parents broke the original agreement, not OP.", "They actually can\u2019t. That isn\u2019t how that works.", "good luck getting back rent when the house was unhibaitable, you failed to make the house habitable, you never asked for rent, and then proceeded to attempt to bully the tenant who is claiming you promised them the house out now that it's habitable.\n\nBeing a deceptive, lying slumlord is not a good look in court", "Take the furniture with you when you leave. NTA.", "Hate to break this to you but if the parents want to evict they can. Legally she is a tenant and they can\u2019t just make her leave immediately. If I was OP I would move out but she\u2019s NTAH for wanting to stay. I said \u201cANYTHING\u201d not everything that\u2019s important to her. Clearly the parents don\u2019t want to deal with the bratty 5 year old in their own home. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23. OP. Reddit doesn\u2019t have your back as they follow the leader.", "Same here. Started ESH, now at YTA.\n\nOP threw money away fixing up a house that isn't hers instead of saving and planning for her own place. This refugee OP keeps talking about has not even agreed to move into that house. And OP is just being flat out stubborn, difficult, and argumentative.\n\nThe more replies I read, the more whiny OP sounds.", "They don\u2019t need to prioritize their grandchildren. OP explained multiple times that her sister & BIL have the money to buy their own house etc. but don\u2019t do it for some reason and now want to stay in that house where OP lives. \n\nAnd please don\u2019t act like childfree people, especially women aren\u2019t discriminated and hated by society, in their workplace as well. Nobody cares about a parent taking time off for certain reasons and sometimes during holidays like Christmas. But so many who don\u2019t have kids are expected to always cover up without getting the same privilege to have days off to meet with their family. Because surprise surprise \u201cfamily\u201d doesn\u2019t mean kids.", "It\u2019s nothing to do with what THEY want. It\u2019s about what the *owners of the properties* (ie the parents) want. They don\u2019t want to live with an additional 3 people. That\u2019s a very clear and logical reason for the sisters family having the property.", "> Who doesn\u2019t have some insight to their sibling\u2019s finances? \n\nMe. It's none of my business. I don't know how much my siblings make, what they have in savings, etc. Why would I? They don't offer that information, and I don't ask. \n\n> They\u2019re literally about to to buy a fancy car, hubby is loaded, and they can afford a house. That\u2019s all literally in the post.\n\nYeah, and my point is OP doesn't specify HOW she knows this information, besides that they're buying a \"fancy\" car, which could be a lease, could be used, etc. Also, buying a fancy car doesn't mean you can also afford a house. If they can afford a house, why did they suddenly leave their old home to move in with their parents?\n\n> OP probably fixed it up, golden child saw how great it looks, and now wants it for herself. \n\nYes, I'm sure OP's sister uprooted her life and moved her entire family in with her parents on the off chance she might be able to convince them after the fact to let her live in that house.", "Yeah, again, they didn't \"give\" her the property. They allowed her to stay there. Giving it to her would mean she owns it. She does not.", "> Again, reread the third paragraph\n\nAgain, I did. They did not give her the house. They allowed her to stay in it. **Those are not the same thing.** If she was given the house, she would own it. She doesn't....because they didn't give it to her. Someone letting you stay in a property does not mean you now own that property. \n> but are choosing to use the parents. \n\nSo kind of like OP, who is choosing to stay with her parents rent-free. \n\n> They can take the shittier place.\n\nIt's not about the shittier place; it's about what makes the most sense for the whole family. Not to mention this also impact's OP's parents - you know, the ones who **own the house**. Why should they live with two adults and a kid while their other kid lives in their other house alone? That doesn't make logistical sense. It makes way more sense to put the family in the second house and OP in the first house. OP still gets a free place to stay.", "The parents have two entitled kids who can't seem to take care of themselves.\n\nOf everyone in the story, the only people who have got their shit together is the parents.  I would trust that over the unreliable narrator who thinks the house was given to them for some reason.", "It works differently here. Singles, couples, and families get different colored cards to go through the line. Families get extra items for the kids + more of the standard items. Couples get a bit more of the standard items. So like for a blue card (family) you'd get 4 pastas at the pasta table but a red card (couple) would get 2 pastas and a black card (individual) would get 1 pasta. This applies to all of the tables they have set up. Sometimes a single person has to choose between two items at a table while a family card will get you both items. \n\nTo be honest I thought that was how it worked everywhere to optimize resource allocation.", "They must if the parents are going to such lengths to house them. It wasn\u2019t \u201cwe want that house or we go get a house.\u201d It was \u201cwe can\u2019t live in that house so we have to move in with the parents.\u201d Obviously op doesn\u2019t know their financial situation as well as they think. The BIL could be in legal trouble, they could have been living above their means, they could even just be having a hard time finding housing due to the housing market. Obviously they need the help though.", "This. I would take every stick of furniture, appliance, sheet, towel, drape, blind, plate, spoon, fork, and knife that I bought out of there. Even if I had to rent a storage unit until I had a new place to stay. See how habitable that house is now when they have to furnish it. Nta.", "> They have offered her a home, food etc in their personal house with them for crying out loud.\n\nThis. I know it isn\u2019t ideal from her point of view. Heck it sucks- though I\u2019d argue a family in a house is better than two families sharing a house.\n\nBut it\u2019s a lot damn more than alot of families I know do. Even having a place to crash is.", "Absolutely, she could have a deposit for her own house now! I\u2019m going for OP has a victim complex, not that sister is golden child.", "Yeah well the owners of the property have some legal shit to deal with now. See, they chose to give somebody tenants rights to the property and now they are suddenly shocked the tenant doesn\u2019t want to move after putting in tons of time and money to the property. Sounds like they\u2019ve gotten themselves on quite the predicament. Maybe they should make better decisions in the future if they want complete and total control.", "That is how it works here too. What you are given is based on number of people and ages.", "Why are you making excuses for a wealthy golden child?", "They have money. I even know broadly the amount they have. My sister is a talkative person. They just don't want to be wasting money when they could be living in a lovely rural property for free and are both currently unemployed. \n\nWhich is fair enough but I have an issue with them being painted as victims of horrible circumstances who are suffering so much when they are reaping results of propping up a terrible thing (and got away with tons of money)"]}
