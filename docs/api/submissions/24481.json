Initially, I recall my mum saying they\u2019d allow me to stay there for as long as I needed. They eventually had to sell it as their finances were stretched and they had debts to pay.

Why would they want to cram so many people in 1 house for no reason? \nAlso, the situation changed for you and your parents. They allowed you to live rent free to help you out. You began renovating as if you were going to stay there forever? \nNo they have several family members in need?", "YTA. \n\nThey let you live in their house rent free, they didn't \"give it\" to you. Maybe the time and money you spent on the house is a nice way to thank them FOR LIVING RENT FREE IN THEIR HOUSE. \n\nYour sister also needs help and you'd rather help a person you barely know? You can't understand how your parents might want your sister's family in their extra house instead of living with them every day? One adult is a lot easier to live with than a whole family with a young child, but did you think about their needs at all? Of course not. You're just engaged in a competition with your sister to see who can get the most out of them.  \n\n\n>They kept making out my sister's situation to be nearly as bad as Olha's.\n\nYour sister is their daughter! You are living in their home and being asked to pay nothing. You are creating a potentially HUGE liability for them by inviting someone else to live rent-free in their home, presumably without a lease. Obviously you know how complicated it is to evict someone from a property since you threatened your own parents with that.\n\nSounds like you're the one who is \"incredibly spoiled.\" It is your parents' house. Your claims that they gave it to you are ridiculous and putting your parents in the position of legally having to evict you has the potential to ruin the relationship with your whole family for the rest of your life. \n\nYou're very lucky that your parents are so generous and reasonable. I'd love to hear their side.", "YTA. You're acting entitled and wondering why your sister acts entitled. \"Not as bad\" does not equal \"good.\" \n\nDoes your situation suck? Yes. \n\nAre you asserting rights you do not have? Yes. \n\nYou're just making things worse. Negotiate knowing that the single, older sibling will often get less than the married, younger sibling.

She\u2019s barely settled and beginning to heal. They could give her a timeline if sisters not figured something out in a few months, but it\u2019s incredibly disrespectful to do so.

I have no idea why you spent your money renovating a place that isn't in your name, but that was your choice, and doesn't further entitle you to the house in any way. and your promise to Olha was nice, but from your own post it doesn't even sound like Olha particularly wants to live there. you can't hold your promise to Olha over your parents head, because it's literally not your place to offer up the home to someone else. of COURSE your parents will prioritize their own flesh and blood over a friend you made. it honestly sounds like you brought up the whole Olha thing to make your parents feel bad about asking you to leave and you're mad and calling them \"un-Christian\" when it didn't work. \n\nit makes way more sense for your sisters family to take the house, you are just one person vs their three. your BIL doesn't have a job right now, his savings will be eaten up by living expenses, it makes no sense for them to buy a new property when your parents have one that they have every right to offer up. you stomping your feet and saying \"fine, evict me then\" is just manipulating your parents kindness, you know that they don't want to evict you because that will be terrible for your credit and rent history. I don't buy that your sister is the golden child at all, you just sound massively entitled. if you don't want to move into your parents house just buy your own, isn't that what you suggest your BIL does?", "NTA \n\nTell them to take you to court and make you whole for the money you put in and go NC.

Everyone is forgetting she took a run down property that parents said she could stay as long as she needed so she made it her home. If it was still run down do you think the parents would tell her to give it up or the sister and her family want to live there? It's not that it's their property but that the parents said go ahead and stay there forever so she feels she could safely do what she wanted (make it livable and her home)\n\nIt almost feels like the parents knew that no one would live there in the previous condition and let her make the home liveable so they could just take it back. I think most people are missing this point.", "So your parents want to provide both of you with rent free housing? And y'all are fighting?", "You don\u2019t need judgement.

It sucks, I know, you probably have attached yourself to the new normal and the house but it\u2019s legally theirs. I don\u2019t think they do it out of preference or favorism either. It\u2019s logical step in their mind - 3 people make more sense in a house than just one. I now Olha has been probably a support for you but for them she is a stranger. What they don\u2019t consider, is that any new changes for you are enormously hard, and that the house means something to you. But holding on to it now will only make things worse for you, cause a drift in the family that will be just more exhausting later. Whether it\u2019s fair or not is not important now. I don\u2019t think fighting for the house will do you any favors. (I could also see that your sister and her husband don\u2019t have nearly as much money as they say or seem to have too).\n\nMove out, I would even consider moving in with your parents to not be completely alone (but you know your relationship the best) and start therapy if you haven\u2019t yet. Don\u2019t hesitate to visit your doctor if things get worse for you. \n\nWish you better days soon.", "NTA. all of this \"legally\" stuff is so annoying. this isn't legal advice. it's \"are you being an asshole\" and you're not. sure, legally you don't have a claim. but your parents are going back on their word and it's okay and normal to push back against having your home (yes, if you live there it's your home) yanked out from under you.", "YTA you seem like the folden child", "NTA\n\nI'm trying to imagine this if this would happen in my family and I would do the same as you. I'm not entitled to anything, but if my parent told me I can stay as long as I want after the death of a loved one, and not even a year later my older sibling with a kid and more money wanted the property... No just no. Legally? Sure, they are in their right, but morally? My sibling isn't entitled to anything either.", "NTA I had a similar situation with my dad. After I spent a few months and a few thousand in repairs, I was asked to move out. But my dad wasn't an AH. He paid me back. Unfortunately, despite not being NTA, you will probably not win this one. Legally they have the upper hand. I'm sorry, but life sucks sometimes. Hopefully you'll get on your feet soon and get away from these toxic people.", "NTA but this is why I quickly got out on my own after HS graduation. Anytime you rely on family for something, they can (will?) hold it over your head. I just don\u2019t have the time or patience for that. I would advise not letting them have something to hold over your head as soon as you can.", "Your not an asshole.. but legally they can toss you off the property anytime.  It sucks that you've put so much time and effort into the house, but its time to find somewhere else to live.  Either that or you ask if they'll sell the property to you, and with that money they can do whatever they want for your sister.\n\nIts a bad situation but if you really want to continue with the drama its your prerogative . Personally the moment they told me \"Its our property, we can do what we want\"  I'd have started making plans to move.  If you really want to piss them off.. when you leave take with you as much of the building as you put into it. Tell them if that's how they want to do things, you'll leave it in the same condition you found it.", "NTA, but you need to move out.

You've been through a lot in a short amount of time and it's understandable that this request, logical as it may be, is a slap in the face and in direct contradiction to your original agreement. \n\nThat being said, I would be looking for other living arrangements so you can have stability in your life and not be at the mercy of other people. I'd also be going LC/NC after that awful last text from your mother once you've relocated.", "NTA, unfortunately the truth is that they legally own the property and they can bully you out of your current home. You can also go the legal route and simply refuse to move forcing them to serve you with an eviction notice and whatnot. \n\nI'm sorry that your family is unreliable and that must feel like a real betrayal.", "NTA, but unfortunately it is your parents\u2019 property. It is not fair for them to ask this of you, given that this has been your home and you\u2019ve fixed it up during your time there, but life isn\u2019t fair. It was good of them to be there for you in your time of need, but pulling the rug out is pretty crappy.  I personally would move out and move away from family. Reconsider how much I want them in your life if you feel they don\u2019t value your relationship. Think about the situation clearly while not in it.", "NTA. Your BIL is facing the consequences of his own actions and I don\u2019t think you should have to suffer for that. Legally, you have to do what your parents say unfortunately. If either uninstall the renovations or ask for reimbursement. I\u2019d recommend moving far away from these people though, they obviously don\u2019t care for you as much as they do your sister.

Your parents obviously think your sister and her daughter can do no wrong and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they suggested she move in with them but she said she wanted the property. Usually the golden child wants what the others have.\nYour parents gave you their word and took it back the second the sister wanted it so I can see why you\u2019re upset. Honestly I would try and get on my feet as soon as possible and then have low-contact with all of them but your brothers. Your parents will always put whatever your sister wants above what you want/need and they have proved that. Your sister sounds like a B and just wants whatever you get from your parents so I would cut contact with her and her family if you\u2019re not getting anything out of the relationship. Family is tricky but if they do not give in the relationship and take and hurt you mentally  and emotionally, it\u2019s time to find your real family that\u2019s not blood.", "I would stay there till I get evicted.

Grief is difficult, and it sounds like you have suffered a lot. That said, your parents are being very logical and reasonable regarding who should now live in the property they own. The swap is a very good deal. Unfortunately, you appear to be too mired in grief, resentment, and other strong feelings to understand that. I have read your comments - in some ways, I actually understand what your mom is trying to say about Olha. You appear to have an unusually strong attachment to her - perhaps it\u2019s not romantic, but there is something there that\u2019s pretty intense. Olha, however, does NOT appear to have the same attachment to you. My concern is that you may be trying to \u201csave\u201d Olha when you couldn\u2019t save your bf. Olha does not seem very receptive to that. My advice is to agree to the swap so you can save money to eventually get your own place and so that you can get grief counseling and/or therapy for the myriad of feelings you are experiencing now and in the past towards your bf\u2019s death, the situation with Olha, your family dynamic, and your relationship with your sister.", "YTA you don\u2019t legally own the property, your repairs/fixes could be considered rent equivalents (if you haven\u2019t been paying them rent, which you should have at least nominally).

Unless there was a \"fix up house to cover rent\" agreement, I would just put everything back the way it was and look for an apartment somewhere. Im sorry your parents are changing the rules mid game on you but since its their property, they kinda can and it sucks especially since it sounds like sis and bil can afford literally any other property.

It\u2019s hard to understand how ur family could set that aside so QUICKLY.  Spring it happened\u2026 it\u2019s still summer (that\u2019s 4 mos. MAX).  To ME that\u2019s a huge deciding favor here. If u were 1 single daughter taking up the space that the \u201cfamily of 3\u201d daughter could use, I\u2019d say ur 100% wrong, take one for the team + go live w/ur parents (temp til u get on ur feet).  But ur grieving, you\u2019ve had tremendous loss in a short amount of time. U shouldn\u2019t be expected to uproot ur life again. But before things get out of control \u2014 here\u2019s my suggestion:\n\n1. \u2014The most important one \u2014 SET UR FEELINGS ASIDE- grief, anger, resentment, sibling rivalry, family baggage, golden child mentality.\n\n2 \u2014SET UP A TIME to sit down + talk to the parties involved. Decide if u should begin w/just parents or ur sister and/or BIL (if ur sister is too reactive, if she\u2019s typically self-centered, lacks empathy, if BIL a volatile guy, if u hv No relationship w/him) etc. but remb that it\u2019s best they\u2019re all there so no one had to repeat ur side to another involved party. It\u2019s best they\u2019re all there if possible. \n\n3 \u2014Explain to them why u think (+ need) the house more or just as much as ur sister.  I\u2019d explain how you\u2019ve been feeling prior to this change (the loss, the upheaval of ur whole life, the only stability you\u2019ve had is the security of this house to grieve, to be alone, to figure out ur future, adjust to this new reality).  \n\nUr love wasn\u2019t any less than ur sister\u2019s or mother\u2019s husband just because he was ur \u201cBF.\u201d. Ask them both to IMAGINE losing their husband, job, moving, then being pressured like this, just as u we\u2019re getting used to this situation.\n\n4 \u2014 BUT BEFORE MEETING come up w/a timeline that you can live with cuz COMPROMISE is the only solution. If u push u won\u2019t win in the end cuz common sense says 3 ppl v. 1 person = u lose.  Do you know how long ur sister wants to stay at your parents?  Do you know how long you\u2019d be staying? \n\nSo figure out a TIMELINE. After u state ur case then tell about about ur compromise.  Like you\u2019ll stay in the house until (pick a reasonable date), then if need be, you\u2019ll move into ur parents home. Reminding everyone that no one plans to stay forever, right??!

Parents seem to be advocating for how bad the sister has it when really, just saying \"It makes more sense to have your sister stay in the house and you with us. Plus, as much as we love it grand-daughter, we really are too old to deal with a cold daily.\" would have gone ways better, even if OP might have felt the unfair treatment still. I am also quite bothered that the sister herself went to OP to ask for the switch, and that it wasn't just the parents asking. If it's the parents sole property, I find it very suspicious that she took the initiative to ask, instead of leaving it to the parents to deal with all that, maybe discussing this with them beforehand.\n\nAnd I have no idea how having a house instead of living with your grandparents is \"healthier\" for a child, as some of y'all seem to put it. Are you telling me it's unhealthy for more than one family generation to live under the same roof? From the info we have, the child's health is zero at risk whether she stays with her grandparents or not.\n\nFor people asking: \"If the sister and her family can afford a new house, why aren't they buying one and staying with the parents?\", here's a very unpleasant answer that, while I hope isn't true, is still a possibility: maybe sister went back to parents in the hopes they'd evict OP from the house so she gets it. Why buy a new house when you can get it for free? Because I'd imagine the parents would also go \"take as much time as you need\" with her, so she moves out, or not whenever she feels like it, especially if she indeed is the golden child OP makes her out to be, that she's aware of it and is ready to take advantage of that.\n\nLastly, OP is in a vulnerable place mentally and psychologically, which must be taken into account as well as for how long it's been (since spring, so not that long). Having a loved one die suddenly is heart wrenching and it's not grief you overcome in a year or two, let alone a few months. OP also lost her job and we don't know if she was able to get a new one so for now I'll assume she might not. All of this technically put her in a more vulnerable position and I would've expected her family to act accordingly (aka, not try to throw a pity party to make her sister seem like the biggest victim), which they haven't, which leads to my verdict that OP is NTA.", "NTA. but I think that you might want to think about at least cut off your sister", "NTA at all\n\nI\u2019d bet after just one visit your sister decided she needed a newly remodeled house - and the easiest way to get one was to manipulate Mom and Dad with her sob story of bad life choices and kick you out with the bullshit kid excuse.  \n\nBut, you should move and move far.
