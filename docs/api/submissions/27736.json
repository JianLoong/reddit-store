WHAT IS SHE DOING ALL DAY BESIDES SPENDING MONEY??", "\u201cYou won\u2019t have enough money to spend on me and the kids\u201d\n\nYes having an hour commute with a 20 yr old car is asking for problems. Repairs, going to work late or not at all, things that will absolutely affect their income. \n\nBut yeah let\u2019s excuse the fact she\u2019s putting all that at risk because, well. He won\u2019t have as much to spoil her with.", "Right? I said as much in my own reply but SURELY there is a massively high bar to revoke custody 100% from the mother. Her income doesn't even begin to factor into anything because this was an arrangement HE was also a party to making. He can't just decide to weaponize it.", "Lol where", "\ud83d\udc80\n\nShe\u2019s not even a SAHM anymore, now that they\u2019re in school she\u2019s more of a SAHW, better yet, a kept woman\n\nThere is a difference", "Well of course it\u2019s unreasonable. But he didn\u2019t know about that until later, so that\u2019s not why he said what he did anyway.", "OP says he has more than enough money to afford it. I know it's crazy because there's so much poverty everywhere, but there's some genuinely rich people out there who can easily set aside a bunch of money for things like a car.", "For what it's worth, my wife and I both absolutely have to save our own money for new cars. We do not utilize the joint funds.", "And they don't award custody because she doesn't want him to buy a new car. Dude is in for a massive wakeup call.", "Pretty much anywhere?  An FHA loan only requires 3.5% down, plenty of commercial loans only need 4-5% down, you just have to pay for mortgage insurance.  $570k will buy a house basically anywhere but NYC and SF/Silicon Valley and even then a condo is possible.", "My whole house was $55k. Rural areas.", "You don't have to be rich to be able to afford to buy a car. \n\nThat is exactly what financing a vehicle is for.", "Or people who aren\u2019t spending a ridiculous amount of money on a car I can get a brand new small chevy car for 24,000 if you have a savings and don\u2019t have to dip into it it\u2019s not shocking her would have the money for it", "It helps if you\u2019ve been driving a 20 year old car too. Not having a payment helps save up money.", "I never said that, I replied to someone talking about a discretionary sum of money. So obviously most people are able to buy cars, but it's generally a joint decision (for couples) and not something one does on a whim. That is unless someone is so wealthy that they have that much money that the cost of a car is something that can be considered a discretionary purchase.", "Financing is fucking expensive 20-30% APR\n\nAnd she flat out bought 20k in jewelery without his knowledge.\n\nHe's definitely NTA", "Yeah unless your wife buys expensive jewelry without telling OP.  It was in the last edit, that\u2019s why he can\u2019t get the car.  She already spent the money.", "Bingo", "Maybe you said that to yourself in your head.  \n\nI just dropped cash for my daughter's car. \n\n That doesn't make me rich.  It makes me really good at saving money.\n\nDude has a vehicle that is 20 years old... no car payment for quite a while gives you the ability to stash $$ away.", "it is a joint decision if you have joint finances, OP is the only one working, the only one managing finances for the kids and for his mooching wife, and he is ALSO managing the household and taking care of daily family tasks. Why would he have to consult with someone who is providing nothing and only taking? This makes no sense, like yeah typically speaking it\u2019s a joint decision but this isn\u2019t a typical scenario, OP\u2019s wife literally went behind his back and bought expensive jewelry (and is why she doesn\u2019t want him to buy a car cuz less money for jewelry)."]}
