My husband grew up where his dad worked and mum cleaned and did everything for him. His family is still very much old fashioned which I don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s their culture and I respect it. Both his parents are very happy like that. \n\nFor a few months I didn\u2019t work so I took care of the house full time, kept it absolutely spotless, cooked did the grocery shopping etc. My husband worked. In the meantime I was building my own business as well. \n\nAbout 4 months ago my husband lost his job and for all that time couldn\u2019t find anything and I had just opened my business which was booming and so I took care of the bills etc.. but as well I was taking care of the house and cooking. He would leave things dirty behind, clothes on the floor, wet towels too. I kept nagging him all the time to clean up after himself and he would just say \u201csorry\u201d or say that he didn\u2019t do it on purpose but nothing changed. \n\nHis father absolutely did not like the fact that I was paying for everything and he didn\u2019t work. He would say how dare he steal my own hard earned money. \n\nBut about a couple of weeks ago, I got fed up and told my husband I would start charging him 10 dollars for everything I had to clean up behind him. He simply said ok and didn\u2019t say anything afterwards. So for the next two weeks I cleaned up after him without nagging or mentioning it and wrote down the date and what I did just in case. In that time I managed to make 150 dollars and now end of the month and told my husband he owed me that. \n\nI guess he didn\u2019t take me seriously and when he say I was very serious he called me an AH and we had a fairly big argument. He still gave me the money as I wouldn\u2019t back down. \n\nMy husband has some savings, not much but some. My husband is otherwise a very good partner and supportive in everything I do and we get along amazingly well. It\u2019s just the cleaning part that is an issue in the marriage. \n\nSo AITA for charging 10 dollars for cleaning up after him or should I just give him back the money and do the cleaning myself?", "created_utc": 1693776462, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1698vym/aita_for_charging_a_monthly_cleaning_fee_to_my/", "score": 138, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What in the world is he doing all day? Stop cleaning. If he\u2019s not working this needs to be on him.", "NTA. He was fine with the arrangement of him making the money and you cleaning, but wouldn't have been fine with doing both, why should you do both? Won't lie, when I read the title, I had Y T A lined up in my head, but yikes I would have probably done the same.", "No, it's not just the cleaning part that's an issue - it's the top level of the issue, and it'll rise up in other ways over time, I've little doubt. Standing firm in your position now was absolutely the best choice you could make. \n\nNTA, and don't return the money. It's a lesson your husband has to learn now.", "NTA\n\nBut what's the long term plan here? It doesn't seem like this is going to make him start cleaning", "You are unequivocally NTA. I understand many households have a certain dynamic but when things change, a good partner will be adaptable.\n\nIn my view, the adult who is currently without work, and is physically/mentally capable, shall perform a majority of the household chores.", "Passive aggressive behavior isn\u2019t the solution. Be direct and work together like a marriage is supposed to do. Do this now and stop the childish behavior on both sides.", "Nta, stop washing his clothes, dishes he uses and cooking for him. He not doing his part so he doesn\u2019t get to benefit from you doing it all.", "NTA. I don't think charging a spouse is a good idea since you are supposed to be a team. But it appears that he isn't working or doing work around the house--so ultimately the fee is besides the point. He needs to contribute something tangible to this partnership. Adults don't get to opt out of doing work.", "Nta. I would have charged him more. He is not a supportive partner he is not working and he is at home sitting on his thumbs. While you work on your business and pay for everything. A truly supportive partner wouldn\u2019t apologize for leaving a mess because he would be cleaning up after himself. He would be doing researching how to make an easy meal for you two even if it means making both of you a sandwich. Not only should you be charging him for picking up after him, you should be charging him for everything he should be helping with like the cooking and laundry as well. I get that he grew up with his mom working as a stay at home mom. But your not you also work he should be helping you not acting as a useless adult child.", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure if children are something you both want in your future, but as long as he\u2019s  like this, that choice should be off the table.", "He is the asshole, picking your own shit from the floor isn't being old fashioned, tell him he isn't a baby.", "Oh ffs. No he is NOT a good partner if you have to do everything. I don't know how you or others in similar relationships put up with that level of assholery.", "NTA. But Y T A for letting him treat you like a bangmaid sugar mama.", "NTA. I would say to try and build him up rather than take him down though. It might be a hit to your ego but say things like \"I had a long day, can you clean the dishes\" eventually he will learn to do it on his own. Its hard for people to change after doing the same thing for years.", "NTA, another approach may be to establish lists of things that need to get done every week. Then there is no excuse to not know what they need to be getting done.", "You\u2019re undercharging.", "This made me laugh and you\u2019re the cheapest cleaner around", "NTA.  Pick up everything he leaves behind and plunk it on the floor beside his side of the bed.", "You are brilliant. NTA.", "NTA you don't need to clean up after him - what is he doing all day if not cleaning etc.", "NTA, \n\nI work 40-50 hrs a week, cook and do dishes most of the time. Every Sunday I do laundry and do general clean up stuff. \nThis year the wife was diagnosed with breast cancer and we've been fighting that since January. At this point I definitely do most of the house work which I know upsets her as she can't physically help as much. Chemo sucks.\n\nYour guy lost his job, not his ability. It may not be his culture to help out at home, then he should have found another job pronto.\n\nYou are holding down the house and chores, he needs to man up and help out, whether he gets another job or not. \n\nThe charging him for your work may seem like a big deal to him, but I did that to my kids once when they complained about helping with chores. Stopped that ahit right away. Good luck!", "Nope, NTAH.", "NTA.  What is he doing all day? Why isn't he cleaning?  If he is going to treat you like a maid, you should get paid for the service.", "NTA.I don\u2019t think so. Hell I\u2019d rather pay my lady than a maid.", "Even before he lost his job, when you were both working his leisure came at the expense of your labor.  That's the definition of exploitation.", "Nta. Hubby is lazy and needs to get with the times. Good for op standing her ground.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is also old fashioned, don't fool yourself.", "It seems pretty petty on both sides, but sounds like there's a lot of info missing. What's your plan as a couple for paying for things and division of responsibility? How much has your husband supported you before your business took off? What does your husband do now? Is he in school, applying at new jobs, working on his game plan or just going to stay at home? Since he's not doing anything at the moment and has more time he should be doing at least little things at home. \n\nTrying to charge him isn't going to solve anything and you knew it wouldn't. I'm surprised he even gave you money. You both have to talk it out and work towards a solution like adults. If you get along as well as you say it shouldn't be hard. I wouldn't work and take care of the house, but all you're doing now is driving a wedge between the two of you.

I put about 15k of my savings in renovating the apartment we have now and the rest of my savings was used to pay half my side of the mortgage and bills. Everything was split 50/50 at that point. Just the chores was my responsibility due to him working and me staying at home. \nIn the meantime I built my business and opened it about 4 months ago and that\u2019s when he lost his job. During 3 months I paid all the bills and food as I got just about enough income from my business to cover everything for the both of us and I didn\u2019t want us to us credit cards. \nDuring the time he was unemployed he was studying at home online trading as he wanted to do that. He used some of his savings to invest in it.", "I cleaned 15 times after him.

You kept the house spotless, you cooked, you built a business. Now you are working and he isn't, and you are still doing ALL the things, you just complained about the extra mess he left behind. So you aren't complaining about still doing the cooking, or most of the cleaning, just the few items that clearly he should be able to pick up himself. \n\nAND those are things he should have been doing even while working. A working person can still pick up their wet towels, put their dish in the dishwasher, etc. \n\nNTA but be better to yourself.", "Lol come on, there are more problems than him not cleaning \n\n1) He doesn\u2019t respect you\n2) He doesn\u2019t listen to you\n3) He doesn\u2019t appreciate you\u2019re financially supporting the family while he\u2019s unemployed \n4) He doesn\u2019t take you seriously \n5) He\u2019s a lazy slob\n\nEdit:  and those are just a few things we\u2019ve learned from one post", "You realize that he literally just sits at home all day\n\nYou didn\u2019t mention kids, we know he doesn\u2019t have a job, the *least* he could do is clean, ya know be an **actual** SAHP\n\nThe fact that it was only 150 for two weeks is also laughable", "If you never intend to have any kids then maybe you can make it work.  If he is willing to pay for a cleaning service when he gets back to work.  But if you want kids then you will end up more and more and more resentful until your marriage breaks apart in a big flaming wreck.  Domestic work isn't 'just'.

He is selfish.", "it's not about cleaning, though - not really. it's about the fact that he is not willing to put effort into your relationship. he isn't seeing you as an equal.\n\nhe takes for granted that you are there to silently and willingly be the maid in the house as a baseline.", "He doesn't respect you or listen to you.", "Lol of course he's amazing to you, you're his sugar mummy bangmaid", "Get ready for the Reddit mob that knows your relationship better than you to come lol", "Good point.

Most day traders either lose money or make only a pittance, as your husband is doing.\n\nYou're being used. You need to sit down with your husband and ask him what his plan is for getting back to full-time paid employment so that he is contributing his fair share to household expenses. Because it sounds as though he's decided to live off you, and has no intention of actually working anymore -- in which case, you have a decision to make: whether or not to stay in a marriage with someone who is not willing to be a full partner to you, and continue carrying his dead weight.", "But you were running a start up business while doing everything. How do you not see how unfair that is?", "Lol nobody likes cleaning, and it's really not rocket science to pick up your clothes and do dishes. There are toddlers who do these type jobs without help.. you plug in the vacuum cleaner and push it around where you want it to clean lol gee, that was a tough thing to figure out, not very good at it lol", "\u201cHe said he\u2019s not good at cleaning\u201d sounds a lot like weaponized incompetence to me. NTA at all.", "You know how you get better at doing something? Practice. And since he has time at home during the day when he's not studying, he can use that time to practice.", "He's doing nothing all day. Lazy", "Luckily, cleaning is like any other skill - you can get better with practice. \n\nIf he's not good at it, he should practice.", "So he's actively working towards a promising \ncareer and invested his savings for both his and your future. Then when he didn't clean and live up to your expectations of what the house should be you said hmmm I'll charge him from what little savings he has left in his account. You bith need to communicate better on this.", "No kids, just two cats. He\u2019s going to start a new job in a week which is a relief. But yes, he sat at home doing\u2026 not much at all. I\u2019m grateful for all the comments and advice it\u2019s a bit of a wakeup call for me and talk to him and get it sorted.", "That\u2019s exactly what I told him about a month ago, and he\u2019s starting a new job next week which pays well same as his last. His father as well told him off at that point because it\u2019s very frowned upon in his family for a man not be working.", "His mum used to pick up after him and cook for him. Then he had a cleaning lady once a week before I came into the picture.", "I can definitely see where you\u2019re coming from. He does do about a couple of hours of studying every few days. But I was tired of having to remind him not to leave food crumbs on the floor or his dirty boxers in the hallway. And despite trying to communicate my annoyance to him, it didn\u2019t really make a difference so I honestly didn\u2019t really know what else to do :/ but thank you so much for sharing with me your point of view", "Why so then you can go back to doing the cleaning and not feel bad about it since he's working? If you're both working you both should be cleaning and you know that's not going to happen", "Wow, the one time that old fashioned thinking worked in a woman's favour.  Good on FIL.\n\nNTA.  And keep the money, you earned it.  Hubby should be doing 50% of chores anyway because if he were by himself he'd be doing 100% of them.", "So once he returns to work, and you\u2019re both contributing financially, he\u2019s going to split the house work with you from then on, correct??", "Is he depressed", "So did he leave dirty dishes in the sink and clothes all over the floor for a whole week to wait for the cleaner to come?", "Yikes lol and what does his dad mean when he says he's stealing your money? Like it's not cool that his wife is bringing home the bacon and the man should be the earner or it's stealing your money? Such a weird way to think lol", "He\u2019s not allowed, he\u2019s a dude /s", "Yes or his mum would come over and she\u2019d clean. He would bring his laundry to his parents\u2019 house and his mum would do it there usually.", "My FIL has an old way approach on what a marriage should be. The man should work and bring the money in the household and pay the bills and look after the woman. He was not happy to hear that I paid the bills with my money and supporting financially his son. It got out that I charged my husband a cleaning fee and he said to my partner that he\u2019s lucky I didn\u2019t charge more and my FIL supports me fully on that.", "Oh dear, sounds like you married a teenager. You\u2019re going to struggle to get him to change now", "Your FIL is wise. His son needs to shape up and contribute some sort of work."]}
