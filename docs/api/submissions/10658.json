Our son (16m) has been wearing dresses for the past year or so. He's cis and straight, and this isn't some crossdressing thing (not that we'd be against him being anything different) he just likes to wear dresses sometimes. He explained it to my wife and I, and we support it. His sister (18f) knows as well. She likes it because they're almost the same size, and he lets her dress him up sometimes, they're closer for it so what's not to like?\n\nHe never really wears any of his feminine clothes out of the house or at school (understandable, kids are evil) but for our family get together he wanted to try wearing something. I warned him it might not go over well, and he understood. He didn't even wear anything weird, just a long skirt with a matching shirt and sneakers.\n\nWe get there and to my surprise there are hardly any comments, just a few people who ask casually when we come in. His cousins (both the boys and girls) were even complimenting him and asking where he got the skirt. I was really happy that he seemed to be meshing well with everyone. It was my own mother who ruined it.\n\nShe took myself and my son aside, and told him he looks insane, and to go put some pants on. He got upset and pointed out he was wearing leggings under the skirt. At that point my uncle and father come over and say other people are saying things, he needs to change. My son got teary eyed, and we ended up leaving early.

Your nuclear family did a great job supporting your kid and its honestly really great that this happened with such supportive people around him instead of an environment where everyone around him was acting like your extended family. There was no reason for them to act that way and there was no \"warning\" needed for them to be prepared to see a boy in a dress lol", "NTA nothing wrong with enjoying the breeze now and then. F your family this wasn\u2019t their lane.", "NTA - People who can't accept others for what they are just because they don't conform to their version of standards are incapable of any mental flexibility to be anything other than rude. Good for you for letting him do it, good for him for being brave enough to try. Neither of you has done anything wrong.", "NTA - You don\u2019t need to give notice for anyone\u2019s clothes\u2026because they don\u2019t need to be approved of beforehand. Otherwise every single person present would have to submit their outfit for review.", "NTA also thank you for being a fantastic parent and wonderful supportive mum. Keep supporting him.", "NTA.\n\nThe AH in this situation is your family that can't handle that he wore a skirt. You did the right thing by leaving early and taking him from that bad situation.", "NTA. Your son is allowed to express himself however he likes. Good for you and the wife for being supportive and shame on the rest of your family for making this non-issue something your son might be ashamed of.", "NTA, but your son definitely isnt as CIS or straight as you think he is...", "NTA, you're cool for letting your son dress as he pleases. It sucks that he had to deal with crap from others the first time he wore it out of the house, and I can understand your worries there, but it's not possible to shield him from narrow-mindedness either.", "NTA\n\nThe way he dresses doesn't affect anyone other than by serving as an imagined affront to their rigid idea of gender. Sounds like you, your wife, and your daughter are an awesome, supportive family. You don't owe your extended family a warning or explanation for a problem they created themselves. That being said, despite being a relatively innocuous thing, it's going to rub some people the wrong way, so this was probably some good practice for letting other people's opinions roll off your back.", "NTA. He was wearing clothes, it\u2019s not like he was exposed in front of family. Men can look great in skirts and dresses. Some male skirt or dress looks are downright high-fashion and I live for them. If women can wear \u201cmenswear\u201d, I don\u2019t see why it\u2019s a problem for a man to wear a dress or skirt if they like them!", "NTA- he wore nothing that was offensive or wrong.  I'm sure if he'd turned up in a kilt no one would have made much of a fuss.  If your son wants to wear a skirt, then he should be allowed to without any comments.  If family can't deal with it, then thats on them.", "NTA. You stood by your kid. He's going to need a thicker skin and smart come back. Other option Ignore what's said. A fact of dealing with close minded people. You're already doing the best supporting and loving who he is.", "NTA. There are much bigger things for people to be concerned about than what someone else wears. He wore what he wanted, it wasn't inappropriate, and people who have an issue with it can go kick rocks.", "NTA. And such a great parent! Your son is lucky to have you.", "NTA. At all. Thank you for affirming your son's choices. I'm sorry your family could not support him in the same manner and I'm glad you removed him from the harmful situation as soon as it was apparent.", "INFO\n\n> this isn't some crossdressing thing \n\n> he just likes to wear dresses sometimes\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\nIsn't that what cross-dressing **_literally_** means? Wearing clothing typically associated with the other gender? It's got nothing to do with identity or sexuality, just garment preference.", "Yta a boy shouldn\u2019t be wearing that", "Question: did you stand up for your son in response to your family? NTA for letting him be himself, but that will flip FAST depending on the answer to this question. You should have both warned of the possibility of shittiness and defended him against it when it occurred.", "Definitely NTA.  You encouraged your son to be who he wants to be while explaining to him that there might be people out there who harbor bigoted views.  You even handled the situation well by leaving instead of arguing with them.  It shows your son he can be who he wants to be even when facing people who won't accept him.  Rather than argue with them, you walked away.  You weren't going to change those family members' minds that night (or, sadly, possibly ever) but you showed him something far more important: at the end of the day, as long as you are who you want to be, no one else's opinion matters.  Even if you have some seriously asinine family members.", "NTA\n\nalmost everyone was fine, and now your son and you know that your father, uncle and mother are not safe people to be himself around and he should just cut them out or pretend to be w/e if he's worried about gifts/inheritance or something\n\nas long as you openly support him bullying from your family shouldn't sting too much because well if you've decided that someone doesn't matter its hard for them to hurt you when you have someone to back you up (but maybe that's just me)", "NTA it was different for them, but so what. They have no say in his apparel. You, nor your son are the problem. Your family is. And they don't matter more than him", "NTA but you sure got a family full of em. Keep supporting your son.", "NTA at all! As a straight man who also loves to wears skirts, I've also received some negative comments about it. You can't really do anything about it, some people are gonna judge him no matter what. What you can do, is support him and teach him how to ignore those comments. Your mom would either have to accept him or being forever annoyed by her grandson. If I were her, I would choose the former.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

People know that straying from the norm will cause others to shame and insult you. He just needs to do his own thing and try to let the hate slide off him. Being family doesn't exempt them from being hateful. I think he was aware that there was a possibility that the reactions from the family would be negative.

Let your kids wear what they want- within reason. I am always fighting with my preteen about wearing revealing clothing.  It was an expectation for many of our parents and grandparents to dress a certain way. They don\u2019t want to deal with the comments and potential stigmas attached to unconventional clothing.  I am guilty of this and made my husband change out of the extremely wrinkled and dirty sweater he was about to wear to Christmas dinner.

However, you might be a little naive if you think people aren't going to react in some way. Anytime we do things outside of our societal norms, people are bound to react in all sorts of ways. They might be supportive, curious, ignorant, judgemental, or downright bigoted and offensive, or anything in between. Just because there is nothing wrong with what your son chose to wear, doesn't mean you should hide your head in the sand and assume dear old grandma isn't going to have her judgemental opinions and feel free to share them. If you had communicated the information and boundaries of acceptable comments with your family beforehand, it might have gone better.

Some people define cross-dressing as wearing any clothes not typical of their gender, and I believe that\u2019s the standard definition.
