My late wife passed away when our youngest was 7 months old. I have always known that J is biologically not mine. We temporarily split just after our eldest was born, we were both young and stupid at the time. During the split, she had a one night stand which resulted in J. We reconciled just before she found out she was pregnant. It is clear that he is not mine biologically, he is white with light brown hair and green eyes. His mother was half Indian and half white, I\u2019m black. As far as I am concerned, J is my son. I\u2019m on his birth certificate, I fell in love with him the moment he opened his eyes. I love him like I do my daughters.  I have never sat J down and told him that I\u2019m not his dad.\n\nI have been married to my new wife for the last 18 months. Her son (W 15M) moved in with us 6 months ago. He used to live with his dad but after a series of disagreements with his stepmum, it was decided he would come live with us. Since he has been living with us, it has been a difficult adjustment. W and J have been at loggerheads because W thinks he should have J\u2019s room as it is bigger and has a big TV and PS5 in it because W is the oldest. My wife has tried suggesting that we swap the rooms but I have refused as this was J\u2019s room long before they moved in and I\u2019m not making J move rooms because W wants the room that is 6 feet longer than the room he is in.\n\nOn the weekend, I came home from running an errand with my youngest to J and W arguing, with W telling J that I\u2019m not J\u2019s biodad so that J doesn\u2019t need to listen to me. W called J an idiot for thinking that someone like me could be the father of someone as pale as J. J was completely heartbroken at hearing this. I\u2019ve spent the weekend reassuring J that as far as I am concerned that he is my son, but I have also explained what happened and that I would support him if he ever wants to search for his biodad. I told J that there is nothing that will stop me from loving him like I do his sisters. I was angry with W for telling J this, and I told him that he was grounded for the next month because that was an incredibly cruel thing to do. I have also confiscated the family games console from the living room (the girls don\u2019t play it, J plays on his own, only W and I use it) and have told him that I will be not putting it back for a month. My wife is angry that I\u2019ve grounded W, saying that its not my place to punish him and that J would find out I\u2019m not his biodad eventually as its obvious that I\u2019m not his dad. She wants me to put the games console back and unground him.\n\nAITA for grounding my stepson?\n\nEdit: Yes, I know that J should have always known that I'm not his biodad. My late wife didn't want him to know when she was alive, she didn't want him or our girls to think less of her for it. However when she died, my son struggled a lot with her death and still struggles but it working through it with a therapist. He struggles with feelings of being abandoned by his mother and I didn't want to add to that. I had been thinking of telling him soon as he is in a better place thanks to his therapist and his counselling.\n\nNot long after I made this post my 9 year old, L, came in and asked if I could change her bedding. She's got a stomach bug and had vomited in bed. In changing her bed, I discovered she had pictures of her mother under her bed. I asked her why these were under her bed and she admitted she had pulled them out of the recycling because she had seen wife throw them out. Apparently my wife threw them out as she didn't want to see any pictures of L's mother. L also told me that my wife didn't like them talking about their mother and wants them to refer to wife as their mother. I was upset when I heard this as I had made it clear to wife when we started getting serious that I didn't want her to be a replacement for their mother, I wanted a partner who would help in raising them. Something I thought she understood. Some redditors have asked we have a prenup. We do, this caused a lot of arguments at the time as I refused to progress with marriage until we had a prenup. Wife is unable to claim the house (it's in trust for the children anyway) or anything that I brought into the marriage. \n\nI did not see wife this morning before she left for work, but I'll be telling her and W to leave and ending the marriage. My children have to come first. I will also be sitting J down at the weekend so that we can have a proper talk about what has happened and I will answer as many questions as I can. Unfortunately, I do not know who his biodad is. My late wife never did, he was just someone she met on a night out with friends, but I will reach out to her friends and see if they know/remember anything about them.", "created_utc": 1682640682, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131c265/aita_for_grounding_my_step_son_for_telling_my_son/", "score": 2178, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That kid learned that behavior somewhere, and her attitude here is very telling.", "Seems like you've got a wife and SS problem. If your wife feels like her son doesn't need to be punished for what he did, I'd be thinking about what else she'd let slide for her son and if that's the case then you need to think if this is the kind of life you want you and your children to live.", "I\u2019m not arguing with what should happen in a blended family. I actually agree with you. I\u2019m saying if the parents of the child don\u2019t want you disciplining their child, don\u2019t discipline their child. And if that doesn\u2019t work for you, then you shouldn\u2019t get married. I agree with you, ergo I wouldn\u2019t marry someone with children who believes that I shouldn\u2019t discipline them. OPs wife seems weird and unfair, which is why i said ESH. \n\nIf OPs son \u201cclearly\u201d is not is biological son, then it doesn\u2019t benefit anyone to wait to have the conversation later. Like with adopted children, there are a myriad of age appropriate ways to explain non-traditional family setups to children. And that should be done early with guidance from a children\u2019s counselor if possible to prevent this exact situation. If it\u2019s as obvious as OP says it is, then if W didn\u2019t do it another child would and OP is doing a disservice to his son by not having that conversation and maybe letting him talk to a professional about it while he is young. I don\u2019t doubt there\u2019s trauma from losing your mother young. Now there\u2019s also the trauma of feeling like you\u2019ve been lied to for 11 years and finding out from someone else (a shitstain of a child clearly) when your father should have told you. W was wrong, W\u2019s mother was wrong. But ultimately this situation could have been avoided by OP.", "I can see why W had a problem living with his dad.", "Oh fuck, someone's being sensible. I'm out of here. I was hoping you'd defend your wife and the rando kid. Boring", "This is not a 'big adult issue' anymore than being adopted is.

If he asked the answer should be \u201cthat\u2019s none of your business or mine\u201d\n\nYeah, I wasn't impressed when I found out. We argued over it and I told her that it wasn't her position to tell W that, especially when J didn't know and she knew that J didn't know.", "I mean why lie to your son. It sounds like it\u2019s painfully obvious that J isn\u2019t his son. W is 15 not 5. Why play on his intelligence like that?", "The red flags to me is the wife punishes his kids but he can\u2019t punish hers. With a VERY fair punishment. \n\nHmmm. I don\u2019t have an opinion on telling the boy sooner. His mother died, I too would be concerned about him growing up feeling \u201cothered\u201d \n\nThe boy is 11, these days there\u2019s loads of information from donor kids, adopted kids etc online to learn from. My son is 2 and a donor child and we are open about that AND he knows who the donor is. Well\u2026 knows isn\u2019t the right term. He\u2019s told, he\u2019s also 2 but he will grow up with that being reality and his uncle being very special to him and us. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t the case here though or the information accessible for them to make a plan. So I get kind of winging it when the right time comes as has always been the case previously. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a how to on this one. You just want the boy to feel equal and loved. \n\nDad is clearly doing the best he can and sounds like he\u2019s doing the best he can with the knowledge he has. The new wife though is interesting.", "There\u2019s a lot of red flags coming from your wife.

She told her son. At 15, and obviously being problematic in the first place, it was horribly stupid to tell him.  Your son is only 11, that kid knew exactly what he was doing.  It\u2019s not about the information being truthful.  It\u2019s about being a cruel little punk that just moved into your house effectively causing major stress. The wife protecting HER sons video games over worrying about YOUR sons hurt is telling volumes.  Do NOT back down from your punishment.  Him and his mom are testing you.  Furthermore sit her down and discuss acceptable behavior.  I would honestly be very worried about the family dynamics here and that your wife is not treating your children the same as her own.  When a parent is dead it is even more common the stepparent will really step in knowing they are in effect the only mother to the kids.  It\u2019s very concerning how she isn\u2019t just as upset as you were.  11yo mom is dead, finds this out in a vindictive way that you aren\u2019t his bio dad, hope that poor kid is ok, this is a lot for a child.", "NTA\nYour wife is the problem here.

The fact that mom doesn't seem to see an issue with it is a massive red flag. How does your step son know J isn't yours biologically? Genetics are weird, for him to bring it up during an argument with your son makes me think his mother told him about this and he's been sitting on it waiting for his moment.\n\nI would watch your wife's interactions with your kids like a hawk after this. J is your son, and he deserved better than to learn about his biological parent like this, shame on your wife for not seeing this as the intentionally hurtful incident it is and good for you for showing J and your stepson that this won't be tolerated. \n\nAlso INFO: exactly what did stepson pull with his step mother than ended with him living with you full time?", "NTA for grounding your step son, but your wife does not seem to be taking her son\u2019s behaviour seriously and is instead enabling it.

What she was doing to your children unbeknownst to you though makes her a HUGE AH.", "Thank goodness L got sick. You might have not known about your wife until it was too late. Good for you for taking this seriously and standing up and caring for your children.\n\nIt's going to be painful at first but it will get better. I recommend family therapy- both to help J cope with this revelation as well as for the children to express how they were treated by your wife. Don't fault yourself too much, you were operating in good faith and assumed you and your wife were on the same page. Now that you know the truth, you can help your children heal.", "NTA, after your edit, it's obvious where W's cruelty comes from, his mother is the same kind of cruel asshole, kudos on kicking them and doing what's best for your kids.", "I'm sure you already know, but NTA.  You're a good dad for putting your kids first.  Wife and step kid sound like awful people and I'm glad you got out.  I wish you and J good luck on finding the biodad.", "I had a stepmother who threw out my dead mother\u2019s pictures and belongings. She also insisted we call her mother. In fact, she would get our father to beat us if we didn\u2019t. She was fucking evil. I can\u2019t tell you the years of distress and emotional anguish this woman caused me and my siblings. She stole my mother\u2019s social security money from us. She bought us discarded, mismatch clothing from a thrift shop but insisted her own 6 year old child wear rabbit fur coats and have everything she wanted. It was truly a real-life Oliver Twist story. If OP divorces this woman, he will be saving his children giant therapy bills later in life. NTA.", "Good on you for standing up for your kids! Good luck with your proceedings.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re telling J all the right things. It\u2019s what my mom told me when a \u201cfriend\u201d let me know that I was adopted.

I how ever have a friend who is black and her mixed race children are varying in their skin tones, one is white passing with ginger hair, obviously if timing doesn't work out and you're sure you're sure, but for your step son to be claiming its impossible he's wrong.", "NTA.\n\nWhat a heartbreaking, yet uplifting, post. You are an awesome parent. Biology does not a family make, as you have proven so well. Best wished to all four of you for a bright and loving future.", "THis seems to be a no win blended family.

For adoption yes that was the norm and what was taught to adoptive parents for 30 years.\n\n2. Adoption or not a child should always be told the truth of thier parentage in age appropriate language. To find out later that the person you believed to be your biological parent is not can create trauma. There's suddenly a before and after moment in that person's life.\n\n3. Telling me I'm inserting myself doesn't change the fact that for the first 11 years of the son's life he was deceived by someone he should be able to trust the most.", "I mean his wife died 6 years ago and he got married 1.5 years ago.

He needs all the support he can get.\nThe sad part is W was completely in the wrong....but... is clearly a screwed up kid who also needs a good parent(which I think you could have been the rolemodel he needed), and structure...and sadly doesnt look like he will get it.\n\nKeep your kids as a priority and leave this toxic situation!", "I\u2019m sorry your soon to be ex is not the person you thought she was. This must be heartbreaking for you. \n\nYou are doing absolutely the right thing by divorcing her. I can\u2019t imagine the cruelty of her trying to cut even the memory of your late wife out of your children\u2019s lives.

Per your edit: it sounds as if you have done an amazing job at handling this situation and made the right call. Your children have been through enough without letting them continue to be abused by soon to be exwife and W.\n\nETA: Maybe you could do one of those DNA tests for J to help find some bio family IF he is interested now or ever is in the future as he gets older.", "NTA protect your kids.", "NTA. And your authority as dad would not come from being there when he was conceived, but from being there for him for everything else in his life.  That other guy is just sperm donor. You are truly the dad.", "I would be mortified. Obviously you said because of skin tones etc he's not you bio kid. He didn't need that ramming down his throat. I'm so pleased yo go rid of her and her kid...the fact she backed up that behaviour is disgusting.\n\nAs for throwing your later wives photos away. It can't be much worse. As a step Mom when our 3 were young I made sure every parent and step parent had a gift for each occasion that the kids chose or made. I've made scrapbooks of their childhood etc and I've always said 'rather than having 2 parents that bicker and fight you have 4 happy parents and their families that love you'", "NTA - Holy shit! There is so much to unpack here. You are absolutely NTA. I\u2019m so sad for you and J having to go through this and for your daughter for having to retrieve photos of her late mother from the recycling bin - and for all the things that your soon to be ex wife may have said behind your back to your children. What a horrible situation. Thank God for the prenup and the trust! My heart goes out to all of you.", "Came here after the edit.\n\nDont let the wife try and sweet talk you out of your decision! That woman is cruel and from the sounds of it; you are an awesome guy who loves his kids more than anything! She will ruin that over time if you let her stay.\n\nGood for u, OP!\n\nNTA.", "NTA. If this is actually a real post, then I would definitely hold off. On trying to  find the  bio dad. Unless you want to deal with custody issues. Even though you're on the birth certificate if he was never told that he was a father, he could try to get some kind of Custody or visitation. When he is 18 he could if he wanted go on DNA databases", "As far as the situation with grounding your stepson, ESH. He was cruel, but you set your son up the by lying to him his whole life.\n\nAs for the rest of it, your wife completely sucks, and you're absolutely doing the right thing by divorcing her.", "OP, I\u2019m not so sure that you should rush and tell your wife and step son to leave. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve done this already, but here\u2019s my opinion on it: they were both wrong. At the same time, your situation is not an easy one to go through for you or your kids, and your wife and step son don\u2019t fully understand. I\u2019m not sure they ever will. This doesn\u2019t mean you should kick them out and ruin a relationship: you married her for a reason. Talk this through as there is no \u201cdeleting\u201d someone, especially someone important like a mother, from a child\u2019s life. J is young, yes, and he deserves to know you aren\u2019t his biological father. But he\u2019s still grieving and you don\u2019t want the kid to reevaluate his entire life before he even fully understands the parts of his life that he already knows. It\u2019s a lot to take in for him.", "Wow, OP, having read your edit, I have to say that you are clearly a good and loving father.

It's not any more complicated than a typical adoption, donor conception, or surrogacy. You don't have to bring up sex at all. There are scripts people can follow. There are even children's books for this sort of thing. Waiting until the kid asks is way too late.", "Just saw the update, good for you.  Kids always come wife.\n\nA thought though, as dna plays funny things, I\u2019d be tempted to do one with your son.  You\u2019d be no worse off since you already \u201cknow\u201d he\u2019s not yours, but on the off chance he is it might be nice to have.

I wish you all nothing but the best.", "NTA OP - your soon to be ex wife and her horrible son are as vile as each other. Take care of your children - especially poor J at the moment", "The kind of person who would throw away photos of a child\u2019s dead mother and tells them not to even talk about their mom? Is disgusting.\n\nThis toxic woman does not need to be anywhere near OP\u2019s children.\n\nWhy did OP marry her? Grief is difficult. Sounds like he thought this woman was a much better person than she actually is. I don\u2019t blame him for not seeing it, OP has been through a lot too. But now that he knows? He absolutely needs to kick this vile woman out of his home to protect his children.\n\nHer 15 year old son is also old enough to know how awful what he did was. That his mom didn\u2019t want OP to punish him (appropriately might I add) is also a gigantic problem considering she sees fit to discipline OP\u2019s children. I wonder where the 15 year old learned his terrible behavior from? Again this woman isn\u2019t someone who should be anywhere near OP\u2019s children.\n\nOP is doing that absolute right thing to protect his kids. They, and especially his son right now, need to be the utmost priority.", "You make good points, but at the end of the day, we are just redditors and OP\u2019s situation is more than just a couple paragraphs that he wrote in this subreddit. I\u2019m basically saying that he needs to look at his relationship and make his own decision, rather than make a rash decision to kick them out because a bunch of Redditors said he should do so.", "Yeah, good eye. Check out the update edit in the OP, there *was* more going on and thankfully OP is putting his kids ahead of his sex life here and getting rid of both assholes.", "Oh I definitely agree that all Reddit advice should be taken with a huge grain of salt. (Aside from \u201cget therapy\u201d as that\u2019s generally good advice and directs people to actual professionals)\n\nMaybe I\u2019m wrong,  but what it looked like to me is that he came to the decision about his wife on his own after he talked to his daughter as that wasn\u2019t in the original post, only the update. It looked like to me that unrelated to the original post, he found the photos and spoke to his daughter. Finding out what his wife had been doing in relation to his kids regarding his deceased wife was what prompted the decision to kick her out. I could be wrong but that was my impression, not that he was making decisions based just on the conflict with his stepson and redditor comments.", "I suppose you could go with a sperm donor story, but it\u2019s going to fall apart as soon as J starts asking questions about who his donor was and what he\u2019s like. If the story dad tells is that the donor was a friend, J will wonder why dad has no information about this friend (even a name). If dad lies and says they went to a sperm bank, he won\u2019t be able to back that up either. As soon as J is old enough to ask the right questions (and he might already be there), he\u2019s going to have to learn that his biological father was a stranger.", "Again, you don't have to get into specifics when a child is little. You don't tell a 2-yo \"your mother's egg and your father's sperm come together to make a baby, but your mom got some other guy's sperm, not mine.\" At that age, it's more like, \"You have one mommy who is your birth mom and your mom mom. Your dad isn't your birth dad, but he is your dad dad.\" This is just off the top of my head. I'm sure there are books that do it better. You get more into mechanics the older you go.", "Okay bud, you\u2019re not the parent. The principal you\u2019re going over is one I not only know but I also personally listened to the donor community myself for my OWN son. My wife and I used a donor to have a our baby. We used a known donor, we are open about it and our son has a great relationship with his entire donor family. He\u2019s 2. He doesn\u2019t get it yet but he will. \n\nThis was not only not the norm 11 years ago, they may very well not know who the child\u2019s bio family IS and the mother has since died. So while I completely agree that a child SHOULD know their roots and have the opportunity to know where they come from that may not be possible right now and why completely \u201cother\u201d a kid with no living parent? \n\nThe answer is I don\u2019t know what I would think in this situation with those resources being unavailable and a kid who has already lost so much. I\u2019m not in that situation and I\u2019m not his parent. A child that young wouldn\u2019t get it. His mum is gone. \n\nIt\u2019s cool to have principals and choices in a black and white world but the world is rarely black and white. My world was. Two women wanted a baby, we obviously needed donor. It was 2020 and TikTok existed with random videos from adoptive kids etc speaking on this so we searched into donor children\u2019s experiences. With that we jumped off of the sperm donation sites etc and asked a very very close friend and organised a situation with someone willing to help us AND be a solid part of our kids life. We also knew his whole family who was VERY keen to be there too. Sweet. VERY different conditions dude. I\u2019m not going to start a moral argument with a single dad doing his absolute best in a crap situation on reddit when they obviously didn\u2019t know, didn\u2019t plan this and resources were not available to him.", "True. I am grasping at straws to understand why he is sticking with this awful woman. Just the little hints here are terrible!", "She's got Wicked Stepmother vibes for sure.", "NTA\n\nBut wow.

You stay with her, then you are SOOO T A.", "NTA, you are doing the right thing in kicking her the f out of your life.  To throw out photos of the kids' mother.  What takes the cake is you are not in a place to tell her kid what to do yet she demands your kids call her mom, wants your son kicked out of his room, and who knows what else.", "I was going to go with a soft NTA - I think that you really should have had a conversation with your wife about what would happen if you needed to discipline W in advance, because there may be issues with his dad regarding discipline. Certainly you need to be able to do something when necessary, but you all would need to be on the same page, and you haven\u2019t adopted him nor do you have primary responsibility, and things can get complex. \n\nHowever, seeing your edit.

My mother had one grandparent who was White. Oddly enough my sister married a White guy and her middle child came out darker than both and looking like our paternal grandmother as well.Genetics can be wild.", "The update wasn't up when I commented but I'm glad he now knows the truth about the woman he married and brought into his children's lives and is taking steps to correct his path.", "Add to that the wife trying to throw away the kids' mom's photos, and I don't think divorcing her is at all out of the question.", "That update came after I posted.\n\nJaysus.\n\nI am really glad OP isn't sitting here like \"we can work this out.\" 'cause that woman is giving wicked stepmother vibes. I wouldn't be surprised if she weren't kicked out, she tried to pull retaliatory punishment on one of OP's kids for some minor infraction and like I dunno, threw away everything in their bedroom but a bare mattress on the floor."]}
