My late wife passed away when our youngest was 7 months old. I have always known that J is biologically not mine. We temporarily split just after our eldest was born, we were both young and stupid at the time. During the split, she had a one night stand which resulted in J. We reconciled just before she found out she was pregnant. It is clear that he is not mine biologically, he is white with light brown hair and green eyes. His mother was half Indian and half white, I\u2019m black. As far as I am concerned, J is my son. I\u2019m on his birth certificate, I fell in love with him the moment he opened his eyes. I love him like I do my daughters.  I have never sat J down and told him that I\u2019m not his dad.\n\nI have been married to my new wife for the last 18 months. Her son (W 15M) moved in with us 6 months ago. He used to live with his dad but after a series of disagreements with his stepmum, it was decided he would come live with us. Since he has been living with us, it has been a difficult adjustment. W and J have been at loggerheads because W thinks he should have J\u2019s room as it is bigger and has a big TV and PS5 in it because W is the oldest. My wife has tried suggesting that we swap the rooms but I have refused as this was J\u2019s room long before they moved in and I\u2019m not making J move rooms because W wants the room that is 6 feet longer than the room he is in.  \n\nOn the weekend, I came home from running an errand with my youngest to J and W arguing, with W telling J that I\u2019m not J\u2019s biodad so that J doesn\u2019t need to listen to me. W called J an idiot for thinking that someone like me could be the father of someone as pale as J. J was completely heartbroken at hearing this. I\u2019ve spent the weekend reassuring J that as far as I am concerned that he is my son, but I have also explained what happened and that I would support him if he ever wants to search for his biodad. I told J that there is nothing that will stop me from loving him like I do his sisters. I was angry with W for telling J this, and I told him that he was grounded for the next month because that was an incredibly cruel thing to do. I have also confiscated the family games console from the living room (the girls don\u2019t play it, J plays on his own, only W and I use it) and have told him that I will be not putting it back for a month. My wife is angry that I\u2019ve grounded W, saying that its not my place to punish him and that J would find out I\u2019m not his biodad eventually as its obvious that I\u2019m not his dad. She wants me to put the games console back and unground him.\n\nAITA for grounding my stepson?", "created_utc": 1682640682, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131c265/aita_for_grounding_my_step_son_for_telling_my_son/", "score": 362, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is condoning what her kid said by backing it up in a discussion with you. Your wife was trying to get you to switch the boy's rooms. The wife is backing her son up with it being okay to say what he wants and have no consequences.\n\nWhat's worse is that your wife was the one to tell W about you not being J's dad. She is allowed to punish your kids, but you can't do anything other than exists with hers. It's no wonder W acts as he does- he gets it from his mother. Sorry OP but your wife and step kid sound rather awful.", "NTA!  And, wow, your wife is TA - as is her son W!  In what universe does she find this behavior acceptable?  Stick to your guns or your entire home situation is going to be run by W and supported by your wife.  This is not okay on ANY level!  BTW, J is so lucky to have you for his Dad and you are amazing!", "And...\nSo W also doesn't think he has to listen to you because you're not his bio dad. But he's living in your house that you and your wife provide. Sounds like you and your wife better get on the same page ASAP about authority and how to address potential issues. He's very likely going to start challenging you on things (home life, school, etc etc etc). He already had problems with his stepmom. And male to male confrontations can be so much worse. Get prepared!", "NTA\n\nEven if J were to eventually find out, it was up to you to tell him, not W. As far as your wife saying it \"isn't your place\" to punish him...uhh, yeah...it is!\n\nShe say anything about it not being W's place to say your not J's biological father?

That kid is entitled af and needs the discipline. Taking the videogame console for a month is the least you can do. \n\nINFO: WHY did W know about this before J did?

I can see where w gets it since she is only worried about her child being grounded and not the trauma he may have caused your son.", "NTA.

Her first strike was suggesting UPROOTING your son from his established room to favour her child. Her second strike was telling W about Js parentage, knowingly giving him ammunition to use in his rivalry that she encouraged with strike 1. Her third strike was not understanding or agreeing with the level of severity of her sons actions against yours (remember, she gave him the ammo.) How many more times are you going to let her actively attempt to harm your child in his own home before you realize that she's got an us vs them mentality that WILL harm your children if you allow it to continue?

The stepson, what he said was horrible and I would argue he got off lightly. Your wife most of all for enabling this behavior and refusing to support discipline her child. Honestly I think you need to start trying to get the stepson out if this behavior continues.", "I kinda want to say ESH but J. You should have discussed the punishment with his mother first. W did an AH thing. Your wife should not treat the situation so lightly and acknowledge that her son messed up.", "Info : \n- Why you never had the conversation with J before ?\n- Do you know why W is so angry ? From your story it seems that he uses all this excuse to express bad feelings. Do you know from where they are coming from. \n- Did you ask to W if he realizes how violent and shocking is what he said and what did he replied?", "certainly NTA.\n\nBut there is an issue with W that needs to be resolved, and this kind of punishment is likely to make the situation worse. \n\nW does not feel valued in the home. this is why he struck out at J. I think you need to get W some help before this gets worse.\n\nI will say that a month is a very long time for teens! You and your wife need to be in agreement on this kind of thing, and W needs some therapy. 15 is a very difficult age to feel unvalued, and so I think you and wife need to find some root issues and help W to feel valued.", "Slight YTA/ESH in that you and your wife either did discuss who would be responsible for disciplining W and you ignored it, or you didn\u2019t discuss it and you disagree. If she doesn\u2019t want you to discipline her child, then don\u2019t discipline her child. That\u2019s that. If that\u2019s an issue for you, you shouldn\u2019t have gotten married. \n\nAs an aside, while you\u2019re not wrong that it was cruel if W to tell J that you\u2019re not his bio dad, the only reason it was cruel was because you didn\u2019t tell him first. You\u2019ve had 11 years to figure out how to have this conversation in an age-appropriate way and you haven\u2019t done so. That\u2019s your fault, not W\u2019s.

It was always going to come out, so you should have told him years ago precisely to prevent someone else using it against him like this.  He should never have had to learn it from anyone but you.", "ESH for the favoritism. If all of the kids can\u2019t have tvs and consoles in their room, none of them can. You created this situation and are blaming a child for its outcomes. While it\u2019s appropriate now to keep W off of consoles for a bit, it wasn\u2019t when you blended the family.", "I\u2019m leaning towards ESH because you should be on the same page with your wife about your role in regards to discipline/grounding.

I actually agree with you. I\u2019m saying if the parents of the child don\u2019t want you disciplining their child, don\u2019t discipline their child. And if that doesn\u2019t work for you, then you shouldn\u2019t get married. I agree with you, ergo I wouldn\u2019t marry someone with children who believes that I shouldn\u2019t discipline them. OPs wife seems weird and unfair, which is why i said ESH. \n\nIf OPs son \u201cclearly\u201d is not is biological son, then it doesn\u2019t benefit anyone to wait to have the conversation later. Like with adopted children, there are a myriad of age appropriate ways to explain non-traditional family setups to children. And that should be done early with guidance from a children\u2019s counselor if possible to prevent this exact situation. If it\u2019s as obvious as OP says it is, then if W didn\u2019t do it another child would and OP is doing a disservice to his son by not having that conversation and maybe letting him talk to a professional about it while he is young.

If he asked the answer should be \u201cthat\u2019s none of your business or mine\u201d\n\nYeah, I wasn't impressed when I found out. We argued over it and I told her that it wasn't her position to tell W that, especially when J didn't know and she knew that J didn't know.", "I mean why lie to your son.

Furthermore sit her down and discuss acceptable behavior.  I would honestly be very worried about the family dynamics here and that your wife is not treating your children the same as her own.  When a parent is dead it is even more common the stepparent will really step in knowing they are in effect the only mother to the kids.

I've heard the same problems in real life where the stepmother damages the relationship between her husband and his other children.
