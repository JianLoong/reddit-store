My late wife passed away when our youngest was 7 months old. I have always known that J is biologically not mine. We temporarily split just after our eldest was born, we were both young and stupid at the time. During the split, she had a one night stand which resulted in J. We reconciled just before she found out she was pregnant. It is clear that he is not mine biologically, he is white with light brown hair and green eyes. His mother was half Indian and half white, I\u2019m black. As far as I am concerned, J is my son. I\u2019m on his birth certificate, I fell in love with him the moment he opened his eyes. I love him like I do my daughters.  I have never sat J down and told him that I\u2019m not his dad.\n\nI have been married to my new wife for the last 18 months. Her son (W 15M) moved in with us 6 months ago. He used to live with his dad but after a series of disagreements with his stepmum, it was decided he would come live with us. Since he has been living with us, it has been a difficult adjustment. W and J have been at loggerheads because W thinks he should have J\u2019s room as it is bigger and has a big TV and PS5 in it because W is the oldest. My wife has tried suggesting that we swap the rooms but I have refused as this was J\u2019s room long before they moved in and I\u2019m not making J move rooms because W wants the room that is 6 feet longer than the room he is in.\n\nOn the weekend, I came home from running an errand with my youngest to J and W arguing, with W telling J that I\u2019m not J\u2019s biodad so that J doesn\u2019t need to listen to me. W called J an idiot for thinking that someone like me could be the father of someone as pale as J. J was completely heartbroken at hearing this. I\u2019ve spent the weekend reassuring J that as far as I am concerned that he is my son, but I have also explained what happened and that I would support him if he ever wants to search for his biodad. I told J that there is nothing that will stop me from loving him like I do his sisters. I was angry with W for telling J this, and I told him that he was grounded for the next month because that was an incredibly cruel thing to do. I have also confiscated the family games console from the living room (the girls don\u2019t play it, J plays on his own, only W and I use it) and have told him that I will be not putting it back for a month. My wife is angry that I\u2019ve grounded W, saying that its not my place to punish him and that J would find out I\u2019m not his biodad eventually as its obvious that I\u2019m not his dad. She wants me to put the games console back and unground him.\n\nAITA for grounding my stepson?\n\nEdit: Yes, I know that J should have always known that I'm not his biodad. My late wife didn't want him to know when she was alive, she didn't want him or our girls to think less of her for it. However when she died, my son struggled a lot with her death and still struggles but it working through it with a therapist. He struggles with feelings of being abandoned by his mother and I didn't want to add to that. I had been thinking of telling him soon as he is in a better place thanks to his therapist and his counselling.\n\nNot long after I made this post my 9 year old, L, came in and asked if I could change her bedding. She's got a stomach bug and had vomited in bed. In changing her bed, I discovered she had pictures of her mother under her bed. I asked her why these were under her bed and she admitted she had pulled them out of the recycling because she had seen wife throw them out. Apparently my wife threw them out as she didn't want to see any pictures of L's mother. L also told me that my wife didn't like them talking about their mother and wants them to refer to wife as their mother. I was upset when I heard this as I had made it clear to wife when we started getting serious that I didn't want her to be a replacement for their mother, I wanted a partner who would help in raising them. Something I thought she understood. Some redditors have asked we have a prenup. We do, this caused a lot of arguments at the time as I refused to progress with marriage until we had a prenup. Wife is unable to claim the house (it's in trust for the children anyway) or anything that I brought into the marriage. \n\nI did not see wife this morning before she left for work, but I'll be telling her and W to leave and ending the marriage. My children have to come first. I will also be sitting J down at the weekend so that we can have a proper talk about what has happened and I will answer as many questions as I can. Unfortunately, I do not know who his biodad is. My late wife never did, he was just someone she met on a night out with friends, but I will reach out to her friends and see if they know/remember anything about them.", "created_utc": 1682640682, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131c265/aita_for_grounding_my_step_son_for_telling_my_son/", "score": 1198, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The wife is backing her son up with it being okay to say what he wants and have no consequences.\n\nWhat's worse is that your wife was the one to tell W about you not being J's dad. She is allowed to punish your kids, but you can't do anything other than exists with hers. It's no wonder W acts as he does- he gets it from his mother.

That kid learned that behavior somewhere, and her attitude here is very telling.", "Seems like you've got a wife and SS problem. If your wife feels like her son doesn't need to be punished for what he did, I'd be thinking about what else she'd let slide for her son and if that's the case then you need to think if this is the kind of life you want you and your children to live.", "I\u2019m not arguing with what should happen in a blended family. I actually agree with you. I\u2019m saying if the parents of the child don\u2019t want you disciplining their child, don\u2019t discipline their child. And if that doesn\u2019t work for you, then you shouldn\u2019t get married. I agree with you, ergo I wouldn\u2019t marry someone with children who believes that I shouldn\u2019t discipline them. OPs wife seems weird and unfair, which is why i said ESH. \n\nIf OPs son \u201cclearly\u201d is not is biological son, then it doesn\u2019t benefit anyone to wait to have the conversation later. Like with adopted children, there are a myriad of age appropriate ways to explain non-traditional family setups to children. And that should be done early with guidance from a children\u2019s counselor if possible to prevent this exact situation. If it\u2019s as obvious as OP says it is, then if W didn\u2019t do it another child would and OP is doing a disservice to his son by not having that conversation and maybe letting him talk to a professional about it while he is young. I don\u2019t doubt there\u2019s trauma from losing your mother young. Now there\u2019s also the trauma of feeling like you\u2019ve been lied to for 11 years and finding out from someone else (a shitstain of a child clearly) when your father should have told you. W was wrong, W\u2019s mother was wrong. But ultimately this situation could have been avoided by OP.", "I can see why W had a problem living with his dad.", "Oh fuck, someone's being sensible. I'm out of here. I was hoping you'd defend your wife and the rando kid. Boring", "This is not a 'big adult issue' anymore than being adopted is.

If he asked the answer should be \u201cthat\u2019s none of your business or mine\u201d\n\nYeah, I wasn't impressed when I found out. We argued over it and I told her that it wasn't her position to tell W that, especially when J didn't know and she knew that J didn't know.", "I mean why lie to your son. It sounds like it\u2019s painfully obvious that J isn\u2019t his son. W is 15 not 5. Why play on his intelligence like that?", "The red flags to me is the wife punishes his kids but he can\u2019t punish hers. With a VERY fair punishment. \n\nHmmm. I don\u2019t have an opinion on telling the boy sooner. His mother died, I too would be concerned about him growing up feeling \u201cothered\u201d \n\nThe boy is 11, these days there\u2019s loads of information from donor kids, adopted kids etc online to learn from. My son is 2 and a donor child and we are open about that AND he knows who the donor is. Well\u2026 knows isn\u2019t the right term. He\u2019s told, he\u2019s also 2 but he will grow up with that being reality and his uncle being very special to him and us. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t the case here though or the information accessible for them to make a plan. So I get kind of winging it when the right time comes as has always been the case previously. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a how to on this one. You just want the boy to feel equal and loved. \n\nDad is clearly doing the best he can and sounds like he\u2019s doing the best he can with the knowledge he has. The new wife though is interesting.", "There\u2019s a lot of red flags coming from your wife.

She told her son. At 15, and obviously being problematic in the first place, it was horribly stupid to tell him.  Your son is only 11, that kid knew exactly what he was doing.  It\u2019s not about the information being truthful.  It\u2019s about being a cruel little punk that just moved into your house effectively causing major stress. The wife protecting HER sons video games over worrying about YOUR sons hurt is telling volumes.  Do NOT back down from your punishment.  Him and his mom are testing you.  Furthermore sit her down and discuss acceptable behavior.  I would honestly be very worried about the family dynamics here and that your wife is not treating your children the same as her own.  When a parent is dead it is even more common the stepparent will really step in knowing they are in effect the only mother to the kids.  It\u2019s very concerning how she isn\u2019t just as upset as you were.  11yo mom is dead, finds this out in a vindictive way that you aren\u2019t his bio dad, hope that poor kid is ok, this is a lot for a child.", "NTA\nYour wife is the problem here.

The fact that mom doesn't seem to see an issue with it is a massive red flag. How does your step son know J isn't yours biologically? Genetics are weird, for him to bring it up during an argument with your son makes me think his mother told him about this and he's been sitting on it waiting for his moment.\n\nI would watch your wife's interactions with your kids like a hawk after this. J is your son, and he deserved better than to learn about his biological parent like this, shame on your wife for not seeing this as the intentionally hurtful incident it is and good for you for showing J and your stepson that this won't be tolerated. \n\nAlso INFO: exactly what did stepson pull with his step mother than ended with him living with you full time?", "NTA for grounding your step son, but your wife does not seem to be taking her son\u2019s behaviour seriously and is instead enabling it.
