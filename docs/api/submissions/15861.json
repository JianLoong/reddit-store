My late wife passed away when our youngest was 7 months old. I have always known that J is biologically not mine. We temporarily split just after our eldest was born, we were both young and stupid at the time. During the split, she had a one night stand which resulted in J. We reconciled just before she found out she was pregnant. It is clear that he is not mine biologically, he is white with light brown hair and green eyes. His mother was half Indian and half white, I\u2019m black. As far as I am concerned, J is my son. I\u2019m on his birth certificate, I fell in love with him the moment he opened his eyes. I love him like I do my daughters.  I have never sat J down and told him that I\u2019m not his dad.\n\nI have been married to my new wife for the last 18 months. Her son (W 15M) moved in with us 6 months ago. He used to live with his dad but after a series of disagreements with his stepmum, it was decided he would come live with us. Since he has been living with us, it has been a difficult adjustment. W and J have been at loggerheads because W thinks he should have J\u2019s room as it is bigger and has a big TV and PS5 in it because W is the oldest. My wife has tried suggesting that we swap the rooms but I have refused as this was J\u2019s room long before they moved in and I\u2019m not making J move rooms because W wants the room that is 6 feet longer than the room he is in.  \n\nOn the weekend, I came home from running an errand with my youngest to J and W arguing, with W telling J that I\u2019m not J\u2019s biodad so that J doesn\u2019t need to listen to me. W called J an idiot for thinking that someone like me could be the father of someone as pale as J. J was completely heartbroken at hearing this. I\u2019ve spent the weekend reassuring J that as far as I am concerned that he is my son, but I have also explained what happened and that I would support him if he ever wants to search for his biodad. I told J that there is nothing that will stop me from loving him like I do his sisters. I was angry with W for telling J this, and I told him that he was grounded for the next month because that was an incredibly cruel thing to do. I have also confiscated the family games console from the living room (the girls don\u2019t play it, J plays on his own, only W and I use it) and have told him that I will be not putting it back for a month. My wife is angry that I\u2019ve grounded W, saying that its not my place to punish him and that J would find out I\u2019m not his biodad eventually as its obvious that I\u2019m not his dad. She wants me to put the games console back and unground him.\n\nAITA for grounding my stepson?", "created_utc": 1682640682, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131c265/aita_for_grounding_my_step_son_for_telling_my_son/", "score": 195, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is condoning what her kid said by backing it up in a discussion with you. Your wife was trying to get you to switch the boy's rooms. The wife is backing her son up with it being okay to say what he wants and have no consequences.\n\nWhat's worse is that your wife was the one to tell W about you not being J's dad. She is allowed to punish your kids, but you can't do anything other than exists with hers. It's no wonder W acts as he does- he gets it from his mother. Sorry OP but your wife and step kid sound rather awful.", "NTA!  And, wow, your wife is TA - as is her son W!  In what universe does she find this behavior acceptable?  Stick to your guns or your entire home situation is going to be run by W and supported by your wife.  This is not okay on ANY level!  BTW, J is so lucky to have you for his Dad and you are amazing!", "And...\nSo W also doesn't think he has to listen to you because you're not his bio dad. But he's living in your house that you and your wife provide. Sounds like you and your wife better get on the same page ASAP about authority and how to address potential issues. He's very likely going to start challenging you on things (home life, school, etc etc etc). He already had problems with his stepmom. And male to male confrontations can be so much worse. Get prepared!", "NTA\n\nEven if J were to eventually find out, it was up to you to tell him, not W. As far as your wife saying it \"isn't your place\" to punish him...uhh, yeah...it is!\n\nShe say anything about it not being W's place to say your not J's biological father?

That kid is entitled af and needs the discipline. Taking the videogame console for a month is the least you can do. \n\nINFO: WHY did W know about this before J did?

I can see where w gets it since she is only worried about her child being grounded and not the trauma he may have caused your son.", "NTA.

Her first strike was suggesting UPROOTING your son from his established room to favour her child. Her second strike was telling W about Js parentage, knowingly giving him ammunition to use in his rivalry that she encouraged with strike 1. Her third strike was not understanding or agreeing with the level of severity of her sons actions against yours (remember, she gave him the ammo.) How many more times are you going to let her actively attempt to harm your child in his own home before you realize that she's got an us vs them mentality that WILL harm your children if you allow it to continue?

The stepson, what he said was horrible and I would argue he got off lightly. Your wife most of all for enabling this behavior and refusing to support discipline her child. Honestly I think you need to start trying to get the stepson out if this behavior continues.", "I kinda want to say ESH but J. You should have discussed the punishment with his mother first. W did an AH thing. Your wife should not treat the situation so lightly and acknowledge that her son messed up.", "Info : \n- Why you never had the conversation with J before ?\n- Do you know why W is so angry ? From your story it seems that he uses all this excuse to express bad feelings. Do you know from where they are coming from. \n- Did you ask to W if he realizes how violent and shocking is what he said and what did he replied?", "certainly NTA.\n\nBut there is an issue with W that needs to be resolved, and this kind of punishment is likely to make the situation worse. \n\nW does not feel valued in the home. this is why he struck out at J. I think you need to get W some help before this gets worse.\n\nI will say that a month is a very long time for teens! You and your wife need to be in agreement on this kind of thing, and W needs some therapy. 15 is a very difficult age to feel unvalued, and so I think you and wife need to find some root issues and help W to feel valued.", "Slight YTA/ESH in that you and your wife either did discuss who would be responsible for disciplining W and you ignored it, or you didn\u2019t discuss it and you disagree. If she doesn\u2019t want you to discipline her child, then don\u2019t discipline her child. That\u2019s that. If that\u2019s an issue for you, you shouldn\u2019t have gotten married. \n\nAs an aside, while you\u2019re not wrong that it was cruel if W to tell J that you\u2019re not his bio dad, the only reason it was cruel was because you didn\u2019t tell him first. You\u2019ve had 11 years to figure out how to have this conversation in an age-appropriate way and you haven\u2019t done so. That\u2019s your fault, not W\u2019s.

It was always going to come out, so you should have told him years ago precisely to prevent someone else using it against him like this.  He should never have had to learn it from anyone but you.", "ESH for the favoritism. If all of the kids can\u2019t have tvs and consoles in their room, none of them can. You created this situation and are blaming a child for its outcomes. While it\u2019s appropriate now to keep W off of consoles for a bit, it wasn\u2019t when you blended the family.", "I\u2019m leaning towards ESH because you should be on the same page with your wife about your role in regards to discipline/grounding.

I actually agree with you. I\u2019m saying if the parents of the child don\u2019t want you disciplining their child, don\u2019t discipline their child. And if that doesn\u2019t work for you, then you shouldn\u2019t get married. I agree with you, ergo I wouldn\u2019t marry someone with children who believes that I shouldn\u2019t discipline them. OPs wife seems weird and unfair, which is why i said ESH. \n\nIf OPs son \u201cclearly\u201d is not is biological son, then it doesn\u2019t benefit anyone to wait to have the conversation later. Like with adopted children, there are a myriad of age appropriate ways to explain non-traditional family setups to children. And that should be done early with guidance from a children\u2019s counselor if possible to prevent this exact situation. If it\u2019s as obvious as OP says it is, then if W didn\u2019t do it another child would and OP is doing a disservice to his son by not having that conversation and maybe letting him talk to a professional about it while he is young. I don\u2019t doubt there\u2019s trauma from losing your mother young. Now there\u2019s also the trauma of feeling like you\u2019ve been lied to for 11 years and finding out from someone else (a shitstain of a child clearly) when your father should have told you. W was wrong, W\u2019s mother was wrong. But ultimately this situation could have been avoided by OP.", "I can see why W had a problem living with his dad.", "Oh fuck, someone's being sensible. I'm out of here. I was hoping you'd defend your wife and the rando kid. Boring", "This is not a 'big adult issue' anymore than being adopted is.  You don't hide an important part of a child's life from them and then get shocked when they find out in a traumatic manner.", ">Dear god. Your wife told him?This sounds like a bad situation. If he asked the answer should be \u201cthat\u2019s none of your business or mine\u201d\n\nYeah, I wasn't impressed when I found out. We argued over it and I told her that it wasn't her position to tell W that, especially when J didn't know and she knew that J didn't know.", "I mean why lie to your son. It sounds like it\u2019s painfully obvious that J isn\u2019t his son. W is 15 not 5. Why play on his intelligence like that?", "The red flags to me is the wife punishes his kids but he can\u2019t punish hers. With a VERY fair punishment. \n\nHmmm. I don\u2019t have an opinion on telling the boy sooner. His mother died, I too would be concerned about him growing up feeling \u201cothered\u201d \n\nThe boy is 11, these days there\u2019s loads of information from donor kids, adopted kids etc online to learn from. My son is 2 and a donor child and we are open about that AND he knows who the donor is. Well\u2026 knows isn\u2019t the right term. He\u2019s told, he\u2019s also 2 but he will grow up with that being reality and his uncle being very special to him and us. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t the case here though or the information accessible for them to make a plan. So I get kind of winging it when the right time comes as has always been the case previously. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a how to on this one. You just want the boy to feel equal and loved. \n\nDad is clearly doing the best he can and sounds like he\u2019s doing the best he can with the knowledge he has. The new wife though is interesting.", "There\u2019s a lot of red flags coming from your wife. I\u2019m not saying act immediately but please keep an eye on the situation, there\u2019s CLEARLY a huge divide between the children and she\u2019s more than happy to allow unpunished cruelty from her 15 year old towards a much younger child. \n\nThat will get worse.", "I would be seriously reconsidering the whole marriage if I were you. This woman is actively harming your kids, and sees nothing wrong with allowing her son to harm them either.", "Well, we agree that new wife sucks. Whatever my opinions about dads obligation to tell his son earlier, wife should *never* have told her son if OP wasn\u2019t planning on tell J any time soon. The discipline issue is just icing on the \u201cred flag\u201d cake.", "Honestly he\u2019s harming his son by carrying on this ridiculous story. I\u2019m sure J\u2019s  friends have inquired about it. He\u2019s 11 it was bound to come out soon anyway.", "You are N T A for grounding your stepson, but you are very much YTA for not having told J about this. You basically adopted J and every adoptee and every therapist will tell you that kids need to be told about their origins early on so that this information is their normal, not a shock at some point.", "NTA but you wife she is TA.  She told her son. At 15, and obviously being problematic in the first place, it was horribly stupid to tell him.  Your son is only 11, that kid knew exactly what he was doing.  It\u2019s not about the information being truthful.  It\u2019s about being a cruel little punk that just moved into your house effectively causing major stress. The wife protecting HER sons video games over worrying about YOUR sons hurt is telling volumes.  Do NOT back down from your punishment.  Him and his mom are testing you.  Furthermore sit her down and discuss acceptable behavior.  I would honestly be very worried about the family dynamics here and that your wife is not treating your children the same as her own.  When a parent is dead it is even more common the stepparent will really step in knowing they are in effect the only mother to the kids.  It\u2019s very concerning how she isn\u2019t just as upset as you were.  11yo mom is dead, finds this out in a vindictive way that you aren\u2019t his bio dad, hope that poor kid is ok, this is a lot for a child.", "NTA\nYour wife is the problem here. If she doesn\u2019t see that her son was deliberately hurtful to his step brother and deserves to be punished for it, then you\u2019re with the wrong person. \n\nTeenagers can be AHs it\u2019s just in their nature but the adults who coddle them and make excuses for their behavior rather than setting them straight are really the ones at fault.", "W had issues with his step-mom?\nYou don\u2019t say\u2026\n\nNot The Asshole for wanting to discipline W. Honestly, what he did was cruel, and he sounds super entitled and/or jealous. He\u2019s a teenager, though, and he\u2019s liable to be emotional and impulsive.\n\nHonestly, a better approach would be to spend some 1-on-1 time with W and try to bond with him. He might be jealous of your children because you love them so much.\n\nGrounding doesn\u2019t work in these situations, believe me. I\u2019m not sorry for a single thing I was grounded for as a kid. (My parents LOVED that method.) You\u2019re just giving him more time to stew in his anger and feelings of \u201cit\u2019s not fair!\u201d \n\nIf you want to teach W empathy and kindness, then that\u2019s what you need to show him. You can be firm about the decisions you made (like about the room) and still be kind.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to be W\u2019s mentor/friend, then it\u2019s probably not a great idea to move him in with you.\n\nTry to remember that W\u2019s personality is not set in stone.\n\nYour wife is right that you shouldn\u2019t have tried to discipline him without [her] input. A good time buffer is \u201cgo to your room, and we are going to have a talk later.\u201d This gives you time to discuss next steps with your wife in these situations.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m going to go with ESH", "NTA for grounding your stepson.\n\nYou kind of are TA for not having told your son WAY earlier about this. I imagine you thought you were protecting him, but this is information he deserved to have much earlier. There is a lot of research out there about how harmful it is for the truth about parentage to be kept from children.\n\nWhat\u2019s done is done, but you probably need to get your son a therapist to process and cope with his feelings.", "You said new wife? Cool. Then she needs to get on board cause yall a FAMILY now and no one should be left out. If J pulled that on her son she would be crying bloody murder.\n\nNTA AT ALL. But your new wifey needs to put her son in check. Cause \"It's MY soOOooon\" should not be a thing.", "NTA, your wife is awful and so is your stepson. I'm sorry, OP, you need to protect your kids. She's already tried to push J out of his childhood bedroom and now says condoning W's bullying. This is not okay.", "NTA. That wasn't W's place to tell J that. That was meant for you and him to discuss when the time came. Your wife really shouldn't be defending that argument either. J is likely to feel like an outsider in his own home now. Don't unground W. He needs to learn his behavior won't be tolerated.", "Bruv you are a top notch dad.   Congrats on being so cool.   You raise them kids how you see fit they\u2019re in good hands.", "My wife is angry that I\u2019ve grounded W, saying that it\u2019s not my place to punish him and that J would find out I\u2019m not his biodad eventually as it\u2019s obvious I\u2019m not his dad. She wants me to put the games console back and unground him. \n\nWell well well if it isn\u2019t obvious where her AH child gets his entitled AH attitude from then I don\u2019t know what is. She really had the audacity to say that? Fantastic parenting and back up as a wife. I don\u2019t know who I\u2019m more disgusted in. The entitled 15 year old who deliberately set out to destroy an 11 year old or his AH mother who doesn\u2019t give a shit only that her precious Angel is without shake console. \n\nNTA but OP, your wife is a shit step mother.", "Look, 15 year olds can be assholes, and their brains aren't fully developed which only adds to the assholeness. But at 15 this kid *absolutely knows* that 'your surviving parent isn't actually your biological parent' is **not** acceptable to bring up in a fight. The fact that mom doesn't seem to see an issue with it is a massive red flag. How does your step son know J isn't yours biologically? Genetics are weird, for him to bring it up during an argument with your son makes me think his mother told him about this and he's been sitting on it waiting for his moment.\n\nI would watch your wife's interactions with your kids like a hawk after this. J is your son, and he deserved better than to learn about his biological parent like this, shame on your wife for not seeing this as the intentionally hurtful incident it is and good for you for showing J and your stepson that this won't be tolerated. \n\nAlso INFO: exactly what did stepson pull with his step mother than ended with him living with you full time?", "NTA for grounding your step son, but your wife does not seem to be taking her son\u2019s behaviour seriously and is instead enabling it. Also if you\u2019re not allowed to give her son punishments you need to stop her disciplining your kids. Her main aim seems to be enabling her sons behaviour and getting him whatever he wants at any cost. You definitely have a wife problem.", "Both of these folks would be marching out of my home, for my kids\u2019 sake.", "NTA. That's an intentionally hurtful and destructive thing to say. Kid needs to understand there are consequences to treating people like that.", "Info- how do you and your wife view the role of step parent? Essentially, does your wife enact consequences and punishments for her step kids without your input?", "Nta. And I\u2019ll refrain from saying what I think the step son is..but you could probably guess", "NTA. And it sounds like your wife doesn\u2019t care about your son at all. If she can\u2019t get on the same page maybe it\u2019s time for her and her son to leave.", "ESH, like your wife said, you can't ground W, you have no authority over him, you have to clear anything to do with W with his mother.\n\nThat being said, she should be with you on this, what he did is not acceptable and there does need to be some consequences for his actions.", "NTA !!! do i think a month is a bit much? yeah maybe, but W deserved his punishment. He said it to be malicious and knew it would hurt J. Whether J looks like you or not is not the point, W was wrong. A 15 year old trying to down an 11 year old kid.. \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcabYour wife also sounds like a piece of work.. not to speak on ur relationship or whatnot but if it ever comes down to it CHOOSE YOUR KIDS AND THEIR WELL-BEING. No woman who would act such a way should be in your or your kids life.. the whole room switching thing was ridiculous.. please continue to stand up for your son and your home", "NTA. Your wife is a heap of red flags though. Sounds like she got comfortable and is showing her true self. \nThe fact that she won't even acknowledge her son did anything wrong is telling. She's an enabler. She's one of those parents who thinks their child can do nothing wrong, and she clearly doesn't feel a thing for your kids. This should be a hill to die on. \n\nYou need to sit down and have a discussion with her, and based on how it goes, divorce should be on the table. If she's okay with her son weaponizing information like that against your 11 year old, she needs to go. This will only get worse.", "A 15 year old weaponising sensitive information to hurt another child is one that you need to be wary of. When that same child has got the backing of his mother, well, you most certainly have a problem in your hands, OP.\nNTA, of course. But your wife is. And there are no polite words for what your stepson is!", "W and mom\u2026", "Exactly. He has a wife issue more than a step son issue, his wife is the one condoning and encouraging this behavior. She wants to play favorites with her child at the cost of OP\u2019s", "I\u2019m so happy I\u2019m not the only one who thought this\u2026\n\nAlso, grounding won\u2019t help the situation, especially for a 15 year old new to the area who needs to make friends. He also needs to bond with his new family. An entire month of stewing in his anger will help no one. You are right to discipline him, but you really need to discuss details with your wife before doing something like this that lasts so long. She\u2019s basically left with no choice but to undermine you because you acted without consulting her about parenting styles for a teenager.\n\nHe\u2019s 15, and will probably never see you as \u201cdad\u201d but he might see you as a mentor someday.", "Yeah, this is the type of information that kids shouldn\u2019t remember being told\u2026 but info they\u2019ve always known. Obviously the one night stand piece doesn\u2019t have to be a part of the story, but absolutely he should have always known that his dad is not his bio dad. This is the recommendation given to parents who adopt or use donor gametes.", "The fact that she doesn't even acknowledge that her 15 year old did something terrible here makes it clear that she's going to excuse anything he does going forward. A 15 year old is more than old enough to know that information like this isn't cool to weaponize during an argument, and mom doesn't think there should be any punishment from this?\n\nI'm also curious as to how step son knew J wasn't OP's biologically. I understand OP is black and J is quite light skinned, but genetics are wild. I think it's slightly suspect that step son brought this up when he thought he and J were alone as some sort of trump card, was he just guessing or has mom told him?", "Wow. NTA. I see where J gets his poor judgement from. WTF was your wife thinking?!?! Clearly W is not mature enough to appropriately handle that information.", "Your wife was a million shades of wrong. She put that bomb of info into SS\u2019s hands, waiting for the bomb to explode. How else has she harmed your children? She\u2019s likely very covert, but this isn\u2019t the first time, I\u2019d bet big on that. You really need to have a lot of thought about whether or not wife and SS are the right people to be living a sharing a life with for your children. She doesn\u2019t respect you or your children. When someone shows you who they are, believe them. Start thinking of other ways they\u2019ve slyly done negative things. Hindsight is 20/20 they say. \n\nI\u2019m sorry J was hurt in this way. Biology doesn\u2019t make a family or love. Please look into some therapy to help J express his emotions. And keep showing up and standing up for your kids.", "How can you stay married to someone who thinks your son, J, is just some throwaway child because he happens to not be blood-related to you? I would be concerned about what else they\u2019re saying to him when you\u2019re not there. \n\nW learned his cruelty from his mother, whom you state actually TOLD him when he asked, even though she knew that J didn\u2019t know. Your wife is the snake in the grass. How long before she comes up with an excuse for you to send J elsewhere so that her beloved son can have his room? She\u2019s Disney villain level here. She and her son are bullying your child. \n\nI feel like you\u2019re underreacting here.", "Agree. Their punishment should be looking for a new place to live where W can dictate which bedroom he wants with her.", "He didn\u2019t lie. It never came up and when it did he was honest."]}
