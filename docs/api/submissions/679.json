I mean, we are more than friends because we have kissed multiple times but we are not yet in a relationship. We both do not want a relationship and we like each other a lot but it is not as simple as fwb. We care for each other and talk things we normally won't share. \n\nNote: We have said we like each and we both get a little jealous if we talk flirty with people of opposite gender but don't really say anything about it.\n\nSo she has a friend, also 19M, let's call him Jack. We have talked about how Jack clearly has feelings for her and she sometimes feels uncomfortable around him because he gets too touchy with hands. The other day she said she would tell Jack that she likes me but she hasn't yet. We decided she should do this as Jack might keep his distance and she might not feel uncomfortable around him anymore.\n\nNow what happened: We had a huge night, where an event was hosted by our university. It was a cultural event where everyone was dressed wearing traditional clothes. We both were really excited. Me, my friends and her, we all were dressed up but Jack was not. He was not going to attend the event but he still tagged along for the bus ride. For some reason, he changed his mind about coming to the event so he needed to dress up too. Even though he lives 5 minutes away from the place where event took place she accompanied him and sent me a text saying \"she could not say no\". Mind you, this is not the first time she has done that, she always seem to can't say no and when she does this kind of thing, my friends ask me why would she do this because she clearly had no reason to.\n\nWhat I think: If she feels so uncomfortable around him, why would she kind of make him feel special? Jack probably thinks that she leaves her friends for me so she likes me and stuff. Also, why would she say she will tell him she likes me when I think she is not ready to?\n\nThis messed my brain up and I ignored her, she is mad at me but AITA for this.

As a 20 F, I can tell you based off my experiences and my friends that it seems like she mostly has you guys around for feelings or attention. She may claim not to like jack but does things like this?  Nah something ain't adding up, lemme tell you if me or my friends don't like someone like than guess what? WE DONT CATER TO THEM. Also people I know used to keep \"options\" around just kinda having them til they made their mind or didn't. Sounds like she kinda has y'all just orbiting her, having her as a focal point. Rather talk things out about this, how u feel and what she does/ says with this guy jack. Chances are she probably is waiting til you make ur ground with her since she won't become public with you. I know this is a weird situation and sounds like hs drama but try to see what's up. If you smell bs from her response, then time to focus on yourself and someone else who won't keep you in the dark.", "First. You need to get your affairs in order. Do you want a relationship or not? I\u2019m 19f and what I see from this is maybe she actually has a little feeling towards \u201cjack\u201d but she has strong feelings for you but you aren\u2019t doing anything about it so she told you she felt uncomfortable to see if you would do anything about it and claim her as your girl (which you failed to do) and she sees that as a fail and realized you probably won\u2019t come around and she should move in subconsciously. She likes you a lot and you like her but you\u2019re kinda blowing it", "I'm going **NAH** and not E S H because clearly you are all just learning about how to navigate the hot steaming pile of relationshits. \n\nSeems like only the other guy has made his mind up and is pursuing a girl who shows she's interested about you who shows some interest but then again not really but there's kissing and maybe she's trying to play you, make you jealous to push you to finally make a move or maybe she just likes the attention but you kinda don't want to give it but it irks you she's flirting while not being exclusive etc etc (And yes that previous monstrosity of a sentence was intentional just to show how exhausting this will we will we not -game is).\n\nThere are relationship subs which no doubt would help you better but I'll give you one golden piece of advice: make your mind up what **you** want, then tell her. Communicate, don't play mind games.", "Make a decision. Is she just an object to you?
