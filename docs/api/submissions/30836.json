So how does your own medicine taste?\n\nNot gonna gain any karma here, but YTA for enclosing that note, and it\u2019s probably why he showed up late. If you\u2019re gonna draw a line in the sand, you have only yourself to blame when the other person crosses it.", "Um, YTA. You should've decided whether you wanted him there with his potential tardiness or not at all, then send or - not - the invite.\n\nIf it's part of his personality that he's always late you should keep that in mind when sending invitations. Why not write in the invite - 'I would really appreciate you being on time for this since this event is very very special to me. If you're running late however please be mindful of how you walk in so you don't interrupt the proceedings.'\n\nImagine if he invited you to the wedding with those words (I know you're not the always late type), it'd probably make you feel disheartened and unwanted too. I'm not surprised he walked in the way he did, you just ruined the relationship even further with that note. At the same time how he walked in was also pretty and inexcusable... Wouldn't see how that would help mend the relationship either!\n\nEDIT thanks to a great discussion in the comments - to add:\n\nThis approach would work only if sister can put aside previous differences and have SINCERITY in this communication.\n\nSay if sister sent the invite as per normal, and when brother accepted to give him a phone call and have a sincere discussion about his tardiness. It would go something like - hey I know we'd had a lot of differences in the past and I'm not going to pretend we always got along. At the same time I want you to know I've been really looking forward to my wedding and I want you to be there. Can I ask that you try to be early to my wedding? (If he's unsure, ask if he can please be mindful of how he enters if he is late).\n\nLogic dictates you fight fire with water. Sending an antagonistic piece of communication, while expecting the worst from the other person, WILL ALWAYS backfire. It is the equivalent of adding fuel to the fire. You can always communicate the same message with respect and have higher chances of the message actually getting through. With how OP communicated, the brother probably took the message as though he's not wanted, hence his response.\n\nIt's not about what sort of treatment the other person 'deserves'. You literally reap the harvest of the seeds that you put in the ground. If you planted tomatoes expecting strawberries, you will still get tomatoes.\n\nIn the same vein, if you expect someone you've had disagreements with in the past to meekly say 'yes dear sister' after an antagonistic message you will most definitely not get it. You have to keep personal differences aside and communicate with your goal in mind.\n\nHope that clarifies my response :)", ">My brother didn\u2019t care and asked where the bar was.

It may not have worked,  but it also may have forced him to respect boundaries earlier in life instead of actively going out of his way to ruin your milestones.

And an excellent last straw. \n\nTell your parents the truth. Let them know that you don\u2019t want to separate them from their son,  but you will no longer accept the pretense that you have a relationship with him directly. \n\nBoth of you will still have family holidays with your parents probably, but you don\u2019t have to invite or inform him of your life events.

If OP had called and communicated to her brother with sincerity as she sent out the invitation I'm very sure she'd have encountered a different outcome.

My (bio) brother is the oldest, and he had some trauma with my parents that I never went through (they did *different* traumatic shit with me), and due to that, he saw me as an adversary, as an enemy.

I would be appalled and so upset by his behavior. \n\nThis should go without saying, but you are absolutely NTA. Your brother is.", "NTA. He is a huge one though. Whether he does it on purpose or is really that clueless. Being super mad and pissed about your request, and then still showing late shows an absolute and utter lack of respect.\n\nWe got one of my buddies to wait by the entrance area. We told everyone to be there 15 min before the service started so that my wife would have 100% of the spotlight. Of course one uncle showed up like 1 minute before she was supposed to walk so my buddy stopped my uncle, who protested and got all mad about it. But wife walked up and did her thing, then buddy let him walk up after we were started. \n\nUncle came up to me after the ceremony and started complaining. With a big smile I pulled him aside and said he could leave right now if it bothered him so much. He started getting upset and I told him this wasn\u2019t about him, and barely about me, and if he made a scene and upset my wife I\u2019d have people physically remove him.

Just stop inviting him.  He doesn't care.", "NTA. I'm someone who's late all the time - I'm always late to job interviews, I miss flights, everything. And when my brother got married, you know what?

Cut him out of your life.", "Uh\u2026.how do I say this\u2026YATAH for setting your brother up for this fight.

What did you think would happen? Well, guess what: you set the rules for the game, he played along, went further than you thought he would, and he won. Damn, you knew better, didn\u2019t you? I believe you did, based on your story. And BTW, of course your brother ITAH as well. They say blood is thicker than water; not true.  And in your case this isn\u2019t even on the level of blood.
