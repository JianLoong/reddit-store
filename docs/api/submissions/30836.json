Never have. I only invited him for my parents. Also, I was adopted so he\u2019s not biologically related to me. He\u2019s always late and in the past we\u2019ve had to tell him an event was 2 hours earlier than it really was so he would be on time. He was late to my high school and college graduation and missed me walk both times. \n\nWhen I was sending invitations, I put an extra note in his that read as follows \u201cI know mom, dad, and I would love for you to attend, but if you\u2019re going to be late, don\u2019t bother showing up. Your girlfriend and her daughter are welcome to attend with or without you.\u201d\n\nHe called me for the first time in years and cussed me out for the note.

Why do you continue to allow him to be a part of your life when he\u2019s clearly not interested? I get some people are always late to things in life, but showing up late to your WEDDING let alone while you were walking down the aisle was intentional. Sometimes family doesn\u2019t deserve to be family.", "NTA\n\nBrothers behavior shows he doesn\u2019t give a shit, why should you ?", "He timed his entrance to purposely disrupt the ceremony and ruin your moment. It\u2019s good he was escorted out. NTA", ">But he walked in as I was walking down the aisle and walked past me to his seat.\n\nHe did that on purpose. The timing is too exact to be an accident.\n\nYou said in another comment it's in your personality to care,  which is fair,  BUT you are also old enough to learn to set boundaries and stop letting people take advantage of your caring personality. You don't have to care about everyone just because \"it's your personality to care\".  Talk to a therapist and they can give you some tips on how to let certain people \"go\" and no longer be hurt by them. \n\nNTA.", "Nta - not sure why you feel like you are. Nothing in this post indicates you are or that anyone but your brother thought so.", "NTA. He's lucky AF he even MADE it to his seat after showing up late. If it had been my sibling, they wouldnt have.", "NTA.\n\nYou do realize he likely did that on purpose, I hope. I\u2019d let this be the last straw and drop the rope if I was you", "NTA - my parents pulled the exact same thing (minus walking past me as I walked down the aisle, because that sh!t is 100% intentional and unforgivable) and, as they\u2019d chosen to host almost my entire side of the aisle (very small wedding), it was a really big deal and something that\u2019s impossible to forget when thinking about a really special time, as a lot of it was waiting on them. \n\nBecause someone may have an issue with punctuality, but wouldn\u2019t that mean they are consistently late to everything - including work and their own special events? When a person manages to be on time for other things, yet strolls in 2 hours late for your events, you know they\u2019re just trying to take you down a notch.", "NTA. People who are always late are narcissistic assholes. They do not care about your time, they only care about themselves. imo, you never should have invited him, knowing what he is like.", "NTA. You now have permission to never invite him to another event ever. If your parents try to guilt you ever again, you remind them of your wedding!", "I\u2019m glad both dads stood up for you. Hugely inappropriate to walk in while the bride walks in. Glad he was kicked out. NTA.", "NTA. This is why weddings should have security. Security would have stopped him from entering the church while the procession was going on. Security could have stopped him at all (if that was your wish).  I think he probably deliberately came in and hung around until you were walking just to mess with you. You know what you need to do. Just ignore him from now and do not invite him to anything any longer.", "NTA. His constant tardiness is inexcusable.", "Do you really need to ask? Seriously?", "NTA, and this is another wedding situation where it\u2019s appropriate to throw wine at them", "NTA. \n\nIt is your wedding. Unless there's some major big emergency, I don't get why he can't find the time to show up on time.", "NTA. He did that on purpose to make a point.", "NTA if you had made this post 1.5 weeks ago, the advice would be to have some security so once it is go time they do NOT let anyone in.  Your brother shows up late well too bad for him, he can go kick rocks.", ">But he walked in as I was walking down the aisle and walked past me to his seat.\n\nThat's contempt and was on purpose.", ">My brother didn\u2019t care and asked where the bar was.\n\nThe impact behind the power tackle I would've delivered if I couldn't restrain myself. \n\nNTA.

That's pretty awesome.", "I don't know about you, but he sure is. Your brother is obviously harboring a grudge against you, blow him off, nothing you can do will ever change that.", "NTA. I think you need to take all of this information out of the closet. My sister is also like this with me (blaming me for ruining her life - we\u2019re both adopted, I\u2019m younger, she thinks my mom has given me more than her because of our birth order). I sat and let my sister ruin my life for a long time. It came to a head while on vacation (my family came to visit me overseas) where she treated me terribly, and after I told my mom all the things she has done to me over the years. Now my family can help my sister realize it was never about me, it\u2019s her problem. She has been living in lalaland making me the bad guy for us not having a dad or for her not being treated \u201cequally\u201d but my mom upon finding out told her that [my mom] was never going to remarry or date, and she had always wanted 3 kids and so if it wasn\u2019t me, it was going to be some other baby. And beyond that, why still be upset? Move on and live a good life. Maybe your dad can confront your brother about his feelings towards your dad\u2019s actions and finally let you be. I\u2019m sorry that people like us are always made to be the bad guy for simply existing.", "NTA and he showed up at your wedding and walked past you deliberately. He wanted to make you mad", "NTA. People who are chronically late have no respect for others. And clearly your brother doesn\u2019t care at all about you. I know you were embarrassed, but he made himself look terrible in front of your guests and that\u2019s the one thing people will remember about him. Honestly, I would simply go no contact with him. Don\u2019t invite him to anything, ever.", "It\u2019s one of the many reasons we don\u2019t get along. He blames me ruining his single kid fantasy because our parents chose to adopt me.

It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to be angry.\n\nu/ranchwrangler239, I know it\u2019s too late for you, b it I would advise anyone else in your position to have people who can bar entrance, at least until key moments (like the processional!) are finished.\n\nJust to be clear: he was thrown out before he could raid the open bar? lol", "It\u2019s just in my personality to care. Some people other than my brother said it rude to do.", "Yeah, he waited outside until he heard the processional music start.", "NTA He woulda been rejected at the front door.", "I only invited him because my parents said would the photos with the whole family would be nice.", "Not having security is the only regret I have about my wedding. Other than my brother\u2019s dramatic entrance.", "Some of these posts are like \"I told my brother please don't hurt me, my brother punched me in the face repeattedly, AITA?\"", "I mean, I think most people would expect their wedding guests (family or not) to show up to the ceremony on time, or if they were late, to have enough decency to not *walk down the aisle with the bride.* \n\nI don't think OP's an AH for expecting her brother to have basic (and I mean the most bare minimum) social skills.", "And they love that I\u2019ve started to meet and build relationships with my bio family.", "I\u2019m sorry you went through something similar. I appreciate you sharing and thank you. My parents are taking my brother out to dinner next weekend to discuss his behavior since my husband and I are on our honeymoon for the next 3 weeks. We\u2019re taking my daughter with us because I don\u2019t want to inconvenience my parents or ask one of my ranch-hands wives to watch her. We decided on a Disney honeymoon so my (our) daughter can have a good time and a Disney cast member can watch her when we want some alone time.", "Girl, kick him to the curb, he\u2019s not worth a life full of the drama he will constantly cause. Do your parents know he has said stuff like this to you?", "He was pulled away from the bar as he ordering a drink.", "If they don\u2019t get along, and the brother is never on time and he cussed her out for her. Why would she think he would follow her instructions?", "No. I never told them. I don\u2019t want to feel like they have to choose between their kids. My brother to remind that he\u2019s THEIR son. I\u2019m not their daughter. Just some kid they took pity on. But I never saw it that way.", "This makes my heart sing.", "I can assure you your parents don\u2019t feel that way, your brother is a jerk. You sound like a wonderful person, it\u2019s your brothers loss.", "If they adopted you, you're 100% their DAUGHTER.\n\nESPECIALLY given the way they stood up for you, several times.\n\nNTA and congratulations on your nuptials! \u263a\ufe0f", "Tell them, they deserve to know. You're their child, they evidently feel and show that. Your father has shown he has no issue calling your brother out.\n\nIt's your brother who's made a decision that its him or you, and your parents can likely see it already and deserve all the information.", "Thank you. He treats me like this then asks to use my equipment (I own a cattle ranch) when his isn\u2019t working. I\u2019ve never loaned it out because I don\u2019t trust it to come back working.", "If I were you I\u2019d cut him off, but that\u2019s my opinion. Can\u2019t be bothered to show up to your wedding on time and instead goes out of his way to try to ruin it. Says all of those nasty things to you and then asks to borrow your stuff? Hell no.", "He also didn\u2019t like that they didn\u2019t get him a truck for his 16th birthday (he didn\u2019t need one), they got him a nice car. They got me a truck for my 16th birthday, but I had a job on a farm at the time and I needed the durability and 4x4. He also doesn\u2019t realize that they never paid for my car insurance. I always did."]}
