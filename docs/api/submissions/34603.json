Our kids are 9-10 yrs old and really want to win! These girls fight hard and truly give it their all. \n\nOne player on the team literally just runs around flailing her arms in the air. She does not know the rules of the game. She will drop to the ground on field and start throwing a fit if the other team scores a goal. Screaming \"we're going to lose!\". It's such a distraction to all of the players on the team. And even the opposing team gets so confused. They have her in the defender box most of the time and when it's time to defend and match up she shakes her hands in the other kids face or just runs the opposite direction. It's just hard to watch as a parent. Also a factor in this is we pay a few hundred in fees every season and some of us help sponsor as well. So we are invested in being competitive. This isn't professional soccer lol but we still take it pretty serious. \n\nI spoke with her mother recently who just laughed and giggled about the girls behavior. Calling it \"cute\" and how she's just having a good time out there. I did not pry into her medical history because that's none of my business.

People write all of this off as \"kids sports\" but for kids who want to play at a select level, its a different level of competition and competitiveness.\n\nThat said, my guess is the coach is a volunteer and doesn't know how to handle this situation.

Then one day the college basketball team were coming to the same gym. Started off where they each took half a court. After a few weeks, they started playing against them. College boys were showing them some tips, and the boys got better. Their highlights were that they actually beat them a few times. \n\nNext season, we slaughtered every game. The boys owned the court. They did blind passing and could literally read each others minds on the floor, and it showed. Their team would beat the other teams so bad, that the coach started putting in his third string players. Younger and little skills. This kept their team strong for years to come. \n\nLesson learned for the boys, patience, accepting everyone on the team and embrace teaching others.

And it\u2019s absurd to think everyone has to cater to this behavior.", "Exactly", "Unless you\u2019re Neymar", "Soccer refs need to do that more often, give a yellow card for simulation", "My son and his best friend were on the different teams in the same league when they were 4, the game they played against one another was hilarious as they were such a matched pair of disinterested tornados.", "Red card the parent from the match", "Its fucking depressing to put time, energy and care into a thoughtful practice plan for a kid to just be a dick and not try. I think its a reasonable expectation, to try. \n\nWhen I say I don't like them, its not like some big grudge I am holding against them but they make the experience of the kids around them worse.  I would say I more hold it against the parents for allowing that sort of behavior out of their children. \n\nWhen you get half a team of kids who don't want to be there, its hard. \n\nI love sports and enjoy coaching. There is nothing better than getting to see kids try and learn new things and help them get better. The first time that kid who struggled all year scores a goal or basket or throws a great pass, its amazing. And that's why I do it, for those kids.", ">But save glaring inconsistencies I think you have to take it at face value.\n\nThe problem with this story is that if a kid was regularly laying on the grass and throwing a tantrum during a game, the ref would probably  just red card them and they'd have to be taken out. Or maybe give the coach a chance to handle it and take the girl out first if they can. Same thing if she's waving her hands in other kids faces as described.\n\nIdk I'm not saying some of the stuff in the OP isn't happening but this one seems hard to take exactly at face value given that the OP says no else is intervening or talking to the girl.", "Yeah, and wouldn't 30 of them be irritated parents because of this 'counterproductive' girl on the wrong team? This is EXACTLY what a coach does. Talk to parents.  \n\nNot one parent bullying another parent, which, again, may result in zero action.  Compared to if the coach talks to her.", "The kid is literally acting out on the field, and everyone use other kids bad behavior as an lesson al the time..", "You're right. Throwing tantrums as a 9 to 10 year old to the point of laying on the ground and yelling is not normal behavior. That's 4th and 5th grade, not 4 and 5 years old. That behavior is not going to fit in a social league any better than in a recreational or club league.\n\nThat said, this kid has either a behavior issue or a neurological issue, maybe both.  If the league isn't accessible to this player, then that needs to be a decision of the coach, not because of frustration one parent expressed to another.", "Yes, my son played basketball.  There were non-competitive teams (up to a certain age), and then there were other teams where kids were expected to try their best.  There were different grades, so that pressure wasn't unduly put on the kids to achieve beyond their abilities, but there was still a certain standard of effort and behaviour expected.\n\nBeyond this level of competitiveness, there was also another league for the higher skilled and motivated kids.  So I suppose this is equivalent to the 'club' teams that people are mentioning.  However, not everyone was able to get into that league.  Some were simply not at the right level for it yet, or there might have been a lot of competition to get in.  That doesn't mean that whilst they are still within their first team, they shouldn't have the opportunity to play properly and try their hardest without this kind of behaviour.  And given the fees and sponsorships, it sounds like the other kids and parents do want to use this team to advance their skills.  After all, this level is where they upskill themselves to the point that they can handle the higher league.\n\nGiven that there is another level of team that sounds much more suited to this child, that is where she should be.  Unless she is prepared to step up in her behaviour and effort, she doesn't belong in a team where kids do take it seriously.", "Disinterested tornadoes is such a perfect description. My nephews favorite part of tee ball was looking for ladybugs in right field \ud83e\udd23", "Your words: \u201cI really don\u2019t like the kids that\u2026\u201d \n\nYou quite literally said you don\u2019t like them. In fact, you really don\u2019t like them", "This whole \u201ctryout\u201d thing you\u2019re getting hung up on makes no sense. It\u2019s youth soccer; the point is to have fun. \n\nSome kids want to play to win and hone their skills, because that\u2019s what they think is fun. Those kids have the competitive league. \n\nSome kids want to ignore the game and just run around flapping their arms, because that\u2019s what they think is fun. Those kids have the social league. \n\nWhat if OP\u2019s kid moved to the social league and started dominating those kids? There\u2019s no tryout for the social league either. Because by your logic, it\u2019s somehow totally fine and totally not an asshole move to intentionally ruin other people\u2019s fun.", "There are no red cards in kids that young.", "It\u2019s the park rec league. Go to a team you have to try out for if you care that much about winning. (Park Rec leagues are not try-out teams. This mom has a warped view of what her kid is involved in.)\n\nKids need to learn to interact with all kind of people and everyone isn\u2019t going to do exactly what they want all the time. It can be a good learning experience.", "And this puts the issue rightly in the coach's hands and not the parents.", "I agree.  This is not just simply a case of the kid not really being that good at the sport.  There is actual negative behaviour.  I'm surprised the other teams haven't complained.", "Yeah from what op said\nIt sounds like the parent doesn\u2019t want to address some potentially real medical concerns and issues but that doesn\u2019t mean the game gets to be ruined for everyone else. I agree with you, coach needs to step up. And I don\u2019t mean about excluding a  kid, I don\u2019t think that will help\u2026this is such a difficult situation because it seems like the kid will suffer either way with this shitty parent.", "LOL. Please tell me more about what I meant. Are you actually arguing with me about how I feel?", "I don't think you understand how kids soccer leagues work. The actual competitive teams are the club teams. These are the teams for the serious athletes/parents and have actual coaches,  practices with expectations, etc. These teams have try outs every year and will absolutely kick kids off the team for the kinds of behavior OP describes.\n\nOPs kid is not on a club team though. They are on the \"competitive\" half of the parks and rec league. The entire parks and rec league is still just for fun and generally won't have any of the best/ most serious athletes. It's just that this parks and rec is attempting to split their league into 2 groups of less serious and slightly more serious kids. But they're only doing it based on the parents choices and it sounds like it's still just local games with volunteer coaches. It's easy to cover for 1 bad athlete at that level, every rec team always has a few terrible kids.", "Playing up (for whatever reason) with his attitude makes it even worse because, the older the teammates, the more serious about the sport and their games they tend to be.", "Of course they keep score. That\u2019s what competitive means. And even rec leagues can have competition, playoffs and winners. Have none of you ever played a single sport against another team? By 10 years old, most kids who would want to play to win have been playing for years and are on track to play for their school teams as early as the next year (middle school) and then JV or Varsity soon after. These aren\u2019t 3 year olds, learning how to kick the ball.", "No. I\u2019m simply responding to what you said despite the fact that you are now denying having said it", "Not sure what part of your response has anything to do with u/next-weather-6397 \u2018s insistence that tryouts are the singular hinge point that makes OP an asshole, but I\u2019ll respond anyway - I\u2019m fully aware that this is a community league and not being run though an academy. Some community leagues do hold tryouts, drafts, etc.; others trust that parents will be reasonable assessors of their child\u2019s interest & ability. \n\nThe point is that the parents of this one kid are totally fine with her ruining the other kids\u2019 fun. Tryouts are an irrelevant fallacy.", "My cousins kid at 10 started having high school coaches asking where he was playing for high school 4 years from then. Not everyone took it that serious to be sure, but it was his intro to being scouted", "Yeah they could, it could be the social league.", "The point is that it's not a serious competitive team. The kid isn't ruining Ops kids fun. OP just signed up her kid for the wrong league if her kid wants a serious competitive experience. Her kids not getting actual high level coaching or competition or a team of fun serious athletes on a rec league team no matter what. That won't change if this one kid leaves."]}
