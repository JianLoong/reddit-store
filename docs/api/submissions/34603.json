Our kids are 9-10 yrs old and really want to win! These girls fight hard and truly give it their all. \n\nOne player on the team literally just runs around flailing her arms in the air. She does not know the rules of the game. She will drop to the ground on field and start throwing a fit if the other team scores a goal. Screaming \"we're going to lose!\". It's such a distraction to all of the players on the team. And even the opposing team gets so confused. They have her in the defender box most of the time and when it's time to defend and match up she shakes her hands in the other kids face or just runs the opposite direction. It's just hard to watch as a parent. Also a factor in this is we pay a few hundred in fees every season and some of us help sponsor as well. So we are invested in being competitive. This isn't professional soccer lol but we still take it pretty serious. \n\nI spoke with her mother recently who just laughed and giggled about the girls behavior. Calling it \"cute\" and how she's just having a good time out there. I did not pry into her medical history because that's none of my business. But the mom voluntarily shared that her daughter had ADHD and was thinking about medications. Personally I think there is something else going on with the kid, but again that part is none of my biz! I then suggested to the mom maybe the social league would be a better fit for her daughter, that what she was doing on the field and during practice was so distracting and counterproductive. That it was detrimental to the team and our chances of even making the playoffs.

They are for the kids who already posess some degree of skill. This girl is not ready for that.

People write all of this off as \"kids sports\" but for kids who want to play at a select level, its a different level of competition and competitiveness.\n\nThat said, my guess is the coach is a volunteer and doesn't know how to handle this situation. In your shoes, I'd contact the league rep and discuss the situation with the league representative in your parks and rec department. \n\nWas it your place to talk to the mother? Probably not but at the same time I fully understand your frusteration.

Then one day the college basketball team were coming to the same gym. Started off where they each took half a court. After a few weeks, they started playing against them. College boys were showing them some tips, and the boys got better. Their highlights were that they actually beat them a few times. \n\nNext season, we slaughtered every game. The boys owned the court. They did blind passing and could literally read each others minds on the floor, and it showed. Their team would beat the other teams so bad, that the coach started putting in his third string players. Younger and little skills. This kept their team strong for years to come. \n\nLesson learned for the boys, patience, accepting everyone on the team and embrace teaching others. They learned how to support and teach younger players by learning from the college boys.\n\nYour daughters are not the only member of the team, and it is not all about you and them.

You may be right that this child does not belong on this team, but you should have raised an issue with the coaches, if at all, not with the mom. You have no right to ask someone to leave. It is not your choice. If the coaches don't think this is a problem, and you do, this is not the right league for you. Being on this team may mean a lot to this child. Have some compassion. What message are you giving your daughter to exclude a child with challenges?", "As a former referee, until I got old enough I didn\u2019t want to run around in the heat anymore, I would absolutely remove someone from the field for repeated instances like that. \n\nWhether the league in question is Social or competitive in nature doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s very heavily about sportsmanship, and the fits are not good conduct, and the flailing arms/hands at people is a potential and unnecessary hazard.", "This doesn't sound like a 'kick the kid off the team' situation.  Sounds like you pay your money and decide which level you want to play at. This kid and/or her mom decided to pick competitive and paid their dues . you can't 'kick them off'....there was likely not a try-out.\n\nBest coach could do is talk to parent and suggest she pick the other, less-competitive path.  Also not good for ADHD girl's self esteem if she is around other girls (and from the sounds of it, parents) who are annoyed by her.", "That's not how rec leagues work.", "But since we don't know what their charter principles are, it would be wrong to assume that development and social skills and learning to function within a group aren't part of the expectations. Just sayin'. They are there for more reasons than ball handling and winning.", "No they shouldn't/t. It's a kids sport. let me know when they are vying for mulitmillion dollar contractrs.", "This really just seems like a poorly organized league. If they want to have a competitive level, there really needs to be a safeguard to ensure parents cannot just buy their way into the competitive tier and ruin the experience for the other kids (and their fee paying parents!).", "I used to ref soccer for this age group. So many of the parents are much more competitive than the kids, and much more emotionally invested. The coach is likely a volunteer, or only slightly compensated. They might be frustrated with the girl at times, but they're not Pep Guardiola. At the end of the day, it's 3rd and 4th grade kids playing soccer. This isn't some academy system or something similar. My feeling is that everyone needs to calm down.", "If she truly doesn't know the rules of soccer, then the coach/person in charge should be stepping in and evaluate the situation.", "But the kid does belong on the team. Because it was open to everybody and her parents signed her up.  So therefore she's just as entitled to be on the team as everybody else.", "How about before 'pulling your child from the team' a parent could open their kind mouths and talk to the coach first. \n\nAnd let's be clear, from what this sounds like it's a city-wide offering, as in, no tryouts, a kid decides whether to play social 'for fun' or to play competitive 'I want to win'. This kid or parents chose competitive.  Maybe they have a friend on the team, maybe the kid really wanted it...it's a delicate situation. \n\nIf OP's kid is truly so disturbed by this other kid, and wants a true competitive team, then try out for a league.  But city-offered, subsidised stuff, you get what you get.", "Parents getting so competitive about children's activities are so pathetic. It's not the damn world cup", "Meh, that's true! But the mom opened the dialog about ADHD and my word vomit poured out. \ud83d\ude29", "I beg to differ.\n\nThere is rec and select/classic.\n\nThis is a Select/Classic team which is competitive developmentally. These kids want to play soccer in high school. They like the competition. \n\nBy about 3/4 grade kids separate into Rec (\"just for fun\") and competitive play in most soccer leagues. There is a significant price differential, time commitment differential and goal differential. \n\nI'm just surprised that the girl made it through tryouts if she is incapable of holding it together on a field when the other team scores. \n\nPlenty of kids with ADHD play on team sports just find - but this girl seems unable to do so at this time. She'd be better suited to individualized team sports like swim team or track where her impulsivity won't impact the other kids ability to play the game effectively.", "Agreed, I commented before I read yours. She has a chance to redeem herself, but some of the comments here unfortunately agree with her. Definitely YTA.", "THE WORST", "I hope I am never that focused on winning like OP is.", "this", "Not really, she got 'brutally' honest feedback and selfish suggestions.  In OP's words in one of her comments 'word vomit'.", "It is a REC league. Not competitive even if a higher level REC league.", "I agree.  I think there was an elite team of some sort for softball when I was a kid. They were selective with that team. But, they did it through tryouts and not making a \"competitive\" versus \"relax\" teams that anyone can join.", "It's rec league so the whole point of it is everybody plays.", "She did make a suggestion though?  Play on the other team.\n\nI played on a rec team when I was a kid because I wasn't super into soccer.  I wasn't like the girl in the OP but I absolutely wasn't the type of kid who played on the competitive league.\n\nThere's a team made for children like her (not ultra competitive) why not play on it?  Seems it would be better for her mental health too, as I bet the focus would be less on winning and more enjoying playing.", "You'd be surprised at how bad these kids want to win! They practice for hours, and my daughter even practices in her free time at home. I did feel slightly like an ass, but this girl throwing fits and rolling around practically stopping the games gets so distracting to everyone. Had to come here and get opinions. I appreciate yours.", "I am really failing to think of how exactly she can help it. How do you see that? \"Your child is being a dead weight for the team and is definitely having some behavioral issues. Do you need any help?\" it sounds really bad.", "Not in this town. Lol they only give the winners trophies. Everyone else gets a bracelet and certificate of participation. And the kids know it.", "This. It is still a recreational league. If OP wants a competitive team with all teammates on the same level with the same goals, they should join a club team. This local parks & rec club seems to have two options for recreational leagues. You pay, you play. If the kids shows up to the practices and participates (even if it is not to a parents liking) the coach will let them play. The fact that the coach has not said anything to the parent of this young girl or booted her from the team tells me it is a recreational league and this parent (OP) is stepping out of bounds. She has no right addressing this with the other parent. If she really wants to push the issue she can have a conversation with the coach about her concerns. I am betting she gets a similar reply from the coach that I have summarized here.", "Yes but also if you\u2019re annoying people are going to be annoyed by you.", "I think thats a pretty easy assumptipn to make when there is explocitly a social and a competitive team.", "Thanks for this!\n\nMy husband and I both coached rec soccer and softball, him our sons, me our daughters. We did it for years. I lost count of how many parents were convinced their kid was going to get a full ride to college than on to the big leagues. They were even worse at the high school level.\n\nYou know how many of those kids fulfilled their parent\u2019s dreams (or delusions)?\n\nZero, zip, zilch.\n\nOP triggered some memories! \n\n9 and 10 year olds! Hell yes YTA!", "When I was reffing in the dark ages, we didn't even keep track of goals until u12. Like the travel clubs had teams at u10, and they played a regular schedule, not no scores reported.", ">So many of the parents are much more competitive than the kids, and much more emotionally invested.\n\nAnd think their child is the next Messi or Alex Morgan, while talk bad about the other kids. Completely agree with you. The kids have to enjoy playing the game, it doesn't matter if it's competitive or not or if they win or lose.", "No, just because a team is open to everybody doesn't mean everybody belongs on the team. If you sign up for a competotive team there is an expectation that you will put forth your best effort to win.", "Parents should have more sense than this one has shown. You sign your kid up for competitive soccer and she doesn\u2019t know the rules?  Thats a mismatch. Kiddo would make more friends and probably have more fun with social soccer. Because if she doesn\u2019t get it together the kids are going to be very blunt with their opinions, soon.", "But at the same time other paying parents are also entitled and promised of a competitive team, let alone having someone disruptive ruining their experience.", "This wasn't city subsidized. These parents are Paying for this team. The other social teams are unpaid/city sub. They made this clear in their post for anyone who bothers to read. No parent should have to pay for a competitive sport and have their child's experience disrupted by someone who isn't competing.", "Right?  Like, we get it, you didn't achieve anything in your life so you're living your childhood through your kids.  Cool, now leave my kid alone and go spend thousands to watch your kid never go anywhere with sports.", "It is a rec league. As long as the kid lives in the geographic boundaries and the parents pay.

I understand your frustration, however, it is not your place to talk to the mother about this.", "So you admit it was 'word vomit' and not well thought-out.\n\nYTA because while it's fine to talk to the mom, you weren't saying it out of any concern about her daughter, but pointing out all the negative behaviour she brings to the table...basically speaking on behalf of the team.\n\nIf you had thought about it, you might have said 'oh, thank you for sharing...I wonder if maybe this league is too competitive for her, could be stressing her out? She obviously really likes soccer, it's so good for kids...they DO have a social league that might appeal to her more? ' \n\nThen just LEAVE IT at that, and if you have a further issue, then take it to the coach.  Other than that, that's all you do.", "No, she didnt. Unless someone gave you truth serum you did not need to say anything", "As a mother you should get some help with your ADHD so you don\u2019t teach your child that it\u2019s a valid excuse to be an asshole.", "You can be to differ all you like, you are still factually incorrect.", "I was walking thru a local park with a friend and we cracked up when we saw a sign asking the parents to be respectful of the referees and coaches who are volunteering their time. An actual sign asking adults to behave like adults.", "If I were you, I would come to talk to the coach. It's mostly his responsibility to deal with this type of situations", "I understand what you're saying, we've been there done that with both our kids.  What you did though was only focus on how the girl negatively disrupts the team and not on what might make THAT girl happier.  Of course the mom was pissed at you, basically saying her kid was annoying. After she opened up that she has ADHD.  Do you know how hard it likely is for a parent to find something for their kid to do?  Of course social team is probably better, but maybe the times lined up better for her, or whatever.  But you ragged on her kid, so mom's gonna rage back.", "If I were the coach I would prolly remove your kid due to your actions.", "Sure....but (assuming you're talking about the 9-10 year old with ADHD) there is a way to rectify it, or help rectify it...and it's certainly NOT by telling the mom of this kid that her child is 'distracting, being counterproductive, and may hurt the team's chances at playoffs'.  I mean the mom may not have even known there were two divisions...if you're a parent of a child with any kind of disability, you're struggling.  Maybe help the mom or be kind to the mom, not attack her child. \n\nPut a little love in your heart :)", "Nope, there is a difference between competitive teams with tryouts or even leagues that have assessments to determine where a player should be and this league, which apparently has neither. She belongs because her parents bought her spot, just like everybody else. Her parents paid, their money is green like everybody else's.  Kid belongs.\n\nI highly doubt the league has any stated \"expectations\" for 9-10 year old girls.

Otherwise, it would be a league program, for example, the 'Riverside TigerCats Soccer Club'. This is where you would have to try out for a competiive team, with much higher fees. Not a city-run program.  That is one you just pick-and-play.", "I don't have ADHD? So confused by this response.", "My softball coach regularly got kicked out of games because he would have meltdowns.

My \"tiny village\" of 200,000 has 4 traveling teams, and several levels of rec programs. The REC programs I have been involved with all have a minimal fee for insurance purposes. I have never heard of any REC program that does not charge a small fee in any place I have lived, so we obviously have different experiences. I have coached, been a referee and was the manager of a traveling soccer team. I even had to pay a fee to take a class for coaching.  I deserved the insult after insulting you, but you are a bit over the top.", "I don't care who you work for.
