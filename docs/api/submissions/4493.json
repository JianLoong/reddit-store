She usually eats at work so I fend for myself for dinner (which is totally fine, I don\u2019t expect her to cook for me). I can cook and generally eat pretty well, but SOMETIMES what I want is just a big greasy double bacon cheeseburger from Wendy\u2019s or somewhere else. It\u2019s bad for me, it\u2019s not fancy, but goddamn sometimes it\u2019s exactly what I want after a long day. \n\nMy gf however though expresses massive disgust any time I eat fast food. She\u2019ll say it\u2019s disgusting, it\u2019s not real food, basically just shaming me the entire time for daring to eat something so filthy and she would never stoop so low to eat from somewhere like *Wendy\u2019s*. It\u2019s annoying to say the least, and I\u2019ve told her that she comes off a bit pretentious when it comes to food and I\u2019d appreciate if she didn\u2019t make me feel bad for eating a fast food burger every now and then.

She had a total meltdown and started bawling, yelling that she was on her period and threw the burger at me and told me to gtfo. I didn\u2019t know she was on her period and i wasn\u2019t meaning to set her off.

She acted all high-and-mighty, made you feel bad about your occasional cravings, and when you lightly teased her about it, she bawled and used the \"I'm on my period\"-card. \n\nI'm a woman and I find that appalling. We all know junk food is bad for us, but shaming other people's occasional cravings is not okay. And then being hypocritical about it is even worse. \n\nShe could've just shrugged and admitted that she sometimes likes to eat junk food, too. That she's on her period and couldn't withstand the temptation. You could've had a proper talk like adults. But no. She won't get off her high horse. When she eats a burger it's due to her hormones, when you eat one, you are a culinary savage. \n\nI might be reading too much into this, but I'd be pissed if I were you.", "NTA. Being on her period does not give her a free pass to be an asshole. She teases you about fast food, she's worse than an asshole for her reaction to you doing the same. She's a hypocrite!", "NTA. Don't say rude things about what other people like to eat if you aren't ready to hear it back at yourself. Not to mention she's eating literally the same food she was making fun of you for eating, she's being super hypocritical. \n\nI assume, at least, you won't have to deal with her freaking out when you eat an occasional burger anymore, since she apparently likes them now.", "NTA Sounds like she can dish it out, but not take it.", "NTA. Period is no excuse, she should stop being a pretentious person and admit that she also has guilty pleasures.", "NTA She, OTOH, is for her comments about what you eat. Really, we all need to step back from commenting on people's eating habits, their weight, their hair style or color, their clothes, etc. Let people live their lives and leave them the hell alone.\n\nETA that if you continue to give her hell about what she eats, then you would be the asshole.

She calls it disgusting and \"not real food\" and constantly berates you over it and you try to make a harmless jab when you see her being a hypocrite and she gets angry.

I think she was just more upset that she got called out.", "NTA\n\nShe didn't have a meltdown because of her period. she got a meltdown because she got caught being an hypocrite.", "NTA, she was probably just embarrassed and sounds like a perfectionist... the don't take well to their own medicine", "Nta.

Girlfriend needs to stop being so stuck up about food, yummy is yummy.", "NTA. She knows she was wrong and is embarrassed and is trying to put the blame back on you. You 100% should have called her out on it because she has made you feel bad on multiple occasions for the same exact thing. Not saying that you should make her feel bad, but pointing it out like you did is 100% not a problem.", "NTA.

The fact that she shames you for eating fast food but does it when you're not around is definitely an AH move on her part", "NTA. I don't like hypocrites like her. It's \"not real food\" but it's still a multi-billion dollar industry (or more) so....she really needs to watch how she judges so much. Not everyone prefers fast food and that's okay. But it's never okay to talk down about a situation, and be a hypocrite by doing the EXACT SAME THING you were just complaining about!

You are unwise for pointing out her hypocrisy in the moment.\n\nA more mature person would have taken note of her meal and filed the information away for later use if/when she criticized your diet.\n\nYou are in the doghouse my friend.

The doc said you have to have her come see me first.  So I talked my wife into going to see that doctor.  Did some blood work, my wife\u2019s progesterone levels were low (and some other hormones were off).  Basically what that doc did was put her on progesterone and she has no more pain during her period.  This might be something to look into for your girlfriend.  I would do a search in your area for a doc that specializes in optimizing hormones, regular docs are stuck in their dogma about hormones.
