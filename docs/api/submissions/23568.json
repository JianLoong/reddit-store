I suggest having a deep communicative conversation about all this and go from there", "NTA, why do you let her walk on you, having the money does not mean you support their vacation. If she doesn't want what you want, she pays for everyone. You paid for her travel and then let her book ridiculous times to arrive, thats on you.", "NTA, OP You are the host, she is the guest. You decide what happens. If SIL doesn't like it, she can spend her own money to do something else. She has no right to control your time and money. She apparently did not come to see you and your husband, she came to me indulge herself.", "NTA - people should be called out when they take advantage of others.

Try talking to him seriously at a good time (just the 2 of you). If nothing changes it may be time to seperate your money if it isnt already. Let him fund his sisters spending and refuse to pay for anything for her if he is so happy playing ATM.", "Nice guests treat their hosts.  You buy groceries, you pick up the check when you are out.\n\nI don't care if the hosts are wealthier or not.  As a guest, you are imposing on people.  \n\nyou probably should confront her, but it won't change her behavior.\n\nJust refuse to ever host  her in the future.", "You are kind of the AH for allowing this shit to get to this. STOP THIS", "The problem is my husband enables this behaviour. I support my parents at times especially for medical needs and I don't have problems if he helps his folks too.. Problem is he and his entire family treat her like a 10 year old who has no means to do anything and once she is here, she decides things not just for herself but even for others.. making remarks about weird things I do and both siblings laughing(apparently all in good humour and a joke which I never seem to understand )", "somewhere I expected her to step up.. The lady was watching youtube videos when we were booking her a cab.. Everytime I try to reason with my spouse, he gets pissed.", "exactly my thoughts.. she just comes, buys stuff and leaves.. I'm more concerned of how this will all pan out if she ever gets married and has kids.. would we still support her entire family then..", "yea, you see darlin, thats just toxic. \ud83d\ude02 theres a difference between supporting your, i assume elderly, parents and contributing to spoiling his little sister. Sounds like theres a lot of behaviors that need to be called out. You deserve nothing but wholehearted love and respect", "This would drive me insane", "Just don't do her any more favors. Its not appreciated! Let hubby deal with everything. You just keep on doing like you feel like doing.\n\nNTA", "That\u2019s husband problem and not SIL problem", "thank you so much.. ! Needed for vent a little.. feels good to know that I am not wrong..", "For the record im not saying do anything drastic quite yet. Just sit your man down at a good time and have a deep conversation where you communicate how you feel about anything you have issues with  But i do suggest preparing yourself and thinking about what your prepared to do in case he doesnt give satisfactory answers ya know? I wish you the best of luck. You got this", "NTA But I can see both sides. I\u2019m not condoning his behavior, but I have been in the same position and it will take some time and effort before he is able to see your side. I spoiled an ungrateful sibling for 45+ years. It\u2019s just hard to see when you\u2019re in the middle of it. My husband basically had to put up with it. He tried to explain to me that it was too much, disrespectful etc and I always excused and justified the behavior. Sibling was younger, had mental health issues, anger issues, had no friends, I was used to mothering and spoiling\u2026 It took a very, very long time for me to see it for what it was and to prioritize my husband. Of course, now I regret that. Hubby stayed with me though and our marriage has definitely improved since I have learned to prioritize him properly.", "NTA.  She needs to learn that she is not the main character of life and other people don\u2019t exist to do her bidding.", "This sounds more like a husband problem than a SIL problem. Because unless you want to separate your finances, her bad behavior will continue for as long as your husband enables it.", "NTA but SIL can only do as much as the two of you allow.\n\nFor example, she asked you to book her tickets and ***you did***. If you don't want to be taken advantage of, \"Sorry sis, if you want to visit you'll need to book your travel, hotel room, and a rental car to get around. We cannot afford to cover you financially on this trip.\" \n\nRinse and repeat every single time.\n\nHowever, if your SO is not on board, she will continue to believe that you all should continue to pay her way. You need to have a discussion with your husband about the money being spent to host and sustain his sister's visits and the fact that you do not agree that your household finances should be available for her use. If you want to budget to take her out once at a nicer restaurant during a visit and cover a meal, that's one thing. But to have this grown woman expect that the two of you cater to her whims is ridiculous.", "NTA", "Realistically, You can\u2019t refuse to host your husband\u2018s sister if you want your marriage to thrive. Not if her only offense is being a spoiled brat. Especially since he contributes to that behavior. You might arrange to take a vacation anytime she comes to visit though.", "Ok NTA separate incomes asap and let HIM alone pay for it. You didn't adopt your SIL.\n\nCut her off and manage your own income", "Let him be pissed. Either he will be or you will be. Let it be him. He\u2019s the one ultimately causing problems."]}
