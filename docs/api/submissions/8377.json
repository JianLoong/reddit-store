Has she brought this up before or is this just out of the blue?\n\nEither way, NTA. You\u2019re doing the right thing by everyone. Imagine how the poor boy would feel if he had another dad stop contact with him.", "NTA. I don't know if she's intolerant or jealous but being pregnant is not a good reason for what she said.", "NTA. He is your son. Get a new girlfriend who understands that families are created in many ways.", "NTA. You can break up with a gf but not a kid you raised. He's your kid.", "NTA. I think you're a great dad!\n\nYour gf is probably just insecure so maybe sit down with her to try talk it all through? Explain that you will absolutely be there for her and your child together, but you're not going to abandon your son.", "Thank God there are men like you.  You are not in the remotest part of the universe an AH. Please do not like your romantic interest change your mind about this by getting you to question your values.  (She would not like to be discarded either.)", "NTA, you consider this child your son and a part of your family. She is entirely disrespecting that. Family isn't just blood. You caring for this boy doesn't take anything away from her or your future child, it should only add to your family. The fact that she can't fathom your connection to this kid is a big red flag in how she may react to other relationships in your life and how possessive she may be.", "NTA. Thank you for being a decent guy and showing up for your kid!", "NTA, he's your son and also dump her, she's awful", "Family is who you choose when you are an adult, regardless of blood relations or not. A child does not even get that choice and i'm glad you are putting in the effort for someone whom you made a big positive impact on.\n\nThe fact that your GF can't even tolerate a few visits a *year*, and few modest gifts for the major holidays, and immediately resorts to gaslighting you over it says **volumes** about her character.\n\nOP i'm just sorry you had a child with this person, because i guarantee you that behavior isn't going to stop at the child. its going to show up in anything else she has a problem with. NTA", "NTA\n\nIf you consider him your son and the ex is allowing it or you otherwise have custody/visitation it's going to have to be something the new GF accepts. I am kinda surprised this wasn't discussed earlier before she got pregnant or earlier in the relationship.\n\nI expect the GF simply does not understand how or why you feel connected to a kid that isn't related by blood. (A lot of people are like this for whatever reason.) On top of this she sees it as helping out an ex and taking resources away from her kid rather than you just supporting a kid you see as yours. This will cause problems.", "NTA! Of course you shouldn't just drop your first son just because you're having another child. Maybe he's not legally your son, but that bond is strong because you both value and nurture it. If your gf can't get her head around this, you'll have a tough row to hoe. She should be thrilled to know you're a committed Dad. Maybe a few sessions with a couples counselor would help.", "You are not the AH!  Not at all, you\u2019re trying to do the right thing.\n\nThe AH is your GF!\n\nI know her being pregnant with your child complicates things, and I\u2019m in no way qualified to advise on that - but she sounds extremely selfish and you should rethink this situation.\n\nDo you really want to be with someone this selfish and unfeeling of others?", "Wow. Yikes. NTA. And thanks for being a good dad; please carry on.", "NTA. You know how many kids wish they had a stand up guy like you in their lives? Millions. What you\u2019re doing for this kid you love and who loves you is admiral.  You make the world a better place.", "Info: has she ever been negative about him before? I want to give her the benefit of the doubt because pregnancy hormones and anxiety are wild and can make you like, really not yourself. Hopefully time and some counseling can help.", "NTA. Love and family aren't decided by genetics. You decided long before she was in the picture that you had a commitment to this child. \n\nI can understand her being concerned if you were sacrificing the well being of your current child for another. That would be a jerk move whether or not the other child was your bio-son.\n\nAssuming that you've always been open about your relationship with your first child, she has no reason to complain. If anything, you'd think she'd be relieved to know that your commitment to a child doesn't hinge on the status of your relationship to the mother. \n\nIt also makes her sound insecure in my opinion. If feeling insecure is an ongoing issue with her, I could see pregnancy hormones making it worse. It would not excuse her behavior though. Being pregnant may make a person act oddly or even badly, but it doesn't excuse it and no one should encourage or allow anyone else to do so. (Before anyone @me, I've been pregnant before and am speaking from personal experience. )", "INFO\n\nCan you afford the spending? Basically you just spent several hundred dollars on your son. Are all the bills paid, and items for the future baby budgeted for?", "NTA - remember she is PG - strange things can happen during this time.", "NTA. You are a true man!", "NTA\nHas she exhibited this behavior prior to being pregnant? If not, it may mostly be pregnancy hormones.", "One would hope it is just pregnancy hormones making her be an asshole but I have my doubts. I'm pregnant and cannot for a SECOND thing of saying those things to my SO. You sound like a really great guy and it's amazing you are there for this little boy. She should see that as a positive because you'll be a great dad for yalls kid. I'd be real careful of any thoughts of making her more than a gf to be honest. nta", "NTA, but she is.

I can only speak from my experience here, but having my second mom (who is really the only mom figure I\u2019ve ever had) is one of the very few blessings i can say I\u2019ve had in my life. I also will say you need to be careful about how GF treats your son when you aren\u2019t around.

I\u2019ve been pregnant, dealt with the massive hormonal changes, and even though I was more emotional than normal, I still never treated anyone differently than I always did. AH behavior, and temper tantrums are not excused because she\u2019s pregnant. So my guess is she\u2019s been looking for a way to cut your son out of your life, and her being pregnant with your \u201creal\u201d kid is the way she thought she could make it happen. I also won\u2019t be surprised if/when she treats him poorly while he\u2019s with you (maybe not in front of you but absolutely when you\u2019re not looking). And I would be concerned to leave them alone because I wouldn\u2019t trust what she\u2019d say to him (ie you\u2019re not is real son, when the baby is born he won\u2019t love you anymore, etc). I had an evil stepmother as a child, and she said some of those things to me (even though he was my bio dad) while she was pregnant with my half brother.

Having been pregnant and having acted completely unreasonably due to hormone soup, I can say from experience that it takes minor things, like grain of sand tiny things, and twists them up into major issues. \n\nLike during my second trimester, I had a full on crying meltdown over some fried chicken I wanted to eat around 2 in the morning that my dad ate instead (road-trip, was in the hotel fridge and I had even told him he could eat it if he needed a low carb snack before bed). Rationally I know that chicken wasn\u2019t good enough to be sobbing over. In the moment though, I was absolutely desolated that he would be so selfish as to eat the chicken I told him he could eat. \n\nThat being said, I also apologized after. Pregnancy can be a wild fucking ride that takes any little fear or concern and warps into something insane to anyone who isn\u2019t fermenting in a baby cocktail. \n\nMaybe OPs partner is worried about money being short. Maybe she feels like OP will love the exes kid more than hers. Or maybe she\u2019s just an asshole who also happens to be pregnant. I\u2019m not saying it makes her actions ok, but I am saying it\u2019s could be more nuanced than just writing it off as her being an asshole. \n\nHopefully OP finds a moment with her when she\u2019s in a good mindset and can have a conversation about why she feels threatened by his relationship with his son that\u2019ll get to the heart of the issue and end with mutual understanding and apologies for any stepped on toes.", "That did not answer any of the questions that I posed. A person can work at a great job, mismanage their money, and be in debt and struggling to make rent.\n\nSo what's your actual situation. Can you afford the gifts you are giving after covering essentials?", "Either you've never been pregnant, or you have and had it easier than a lot of us.

That's not how it works. It's totally awesome that our bodies can literally create *a brand-new person* but it's not carte blanche to be awful.", "Ok bro", "Agreed, but she is pregnant, and it seems like she might be a first time mom. Giving someone a little grace until they're back to their senses is generally more advisable than just assuming the worst about someone, especially since we don't know what her history is with his non-blood soon. \n\nNo one is perfect, and while her behavior isn't acceptable, going nuclear on a woman carrying a child, especially if this is uncharacteristic behavior, is only going to end in heartache for everyone. I'm glad my husband was able to give me grace during and after pregnancy because I know I was very hard to deal with. Once my hormones levelled out, I was able to apologize and do the work required to repair damage I had done."]}
