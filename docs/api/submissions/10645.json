Also Imagine how worse it could have been if he laughed and then felt free to make a real racist 'joke'! yikes!\n\nHope he can be invited for next parties. What if he's also concerned he has blown up things.", "> It\u2019s the transition from \u201cnot racist\u201d to \u201canti racist,\u201d and i find it really hard to explain to someone who doesn\u2019t get it. \n\nI'm not sure what you mean by this, but it seems clear to me that the white guy's moronic behavior is a great example of him taking an anti-racist stand. I think in his mind it was a \"gotta call it out when you see it\" kinda situation. I blame him not for his (textbook) execution in upholding the ideology but for buying into it in the first place. By any definition that I know of the term, \"anti-racism\" justifies him in thinking he ought to autistically participate in this kind of policing even though the small print of his espoused cause makes it clear that white guys are expected to be allies, but operating without any guidelines about how to avoid being dismissed or ostracized for joining a conversation they don't belong in due to a lack of \"lived experience\". \n\nDespite the extensive woke priesthood in academia and the media working tirelessly to map out the new landscape of race relations and to convey all these new rules to the average Joe , this is exactly the kind of silliness I expect to see when critical theory escapes the ivory tower and slips into casual social interactions.\n\nCalling the white guy a dumbass in this situation is probably fair, but calling him a racist in his own right, as many have done here, is a sign of someone too clueless to see that they've gotten what they wished for.", "C*.

We only need to lift up the voices of those who are experiencing the racism/ bigotry. We have no understanding of the lived experience of marginalized people. We need to de-center ourselves; to Literally and figuratively put our bodies between the racists/cops/ Christo-fascists.  It\u2019s very hard to realize we don\u2019t need recognition, we don\u2019t need validation and we don\u2019t need to be liked.", "Black Friday has nothing to do with Friday the 13th.", "Yes! People can internalize misogyny, racism, homophobia, etc. It\u2019s built into the system so we all get a lot of that messaging. It can be hard to reprogram.", "This.  Been seeing a lot of this recently.  I've gotten it myself from people online especially who say I can't be my ethnicity because my opinions don't align with what *they* think people of my ethnicity should believe.  I'm biracial, so it's even worse (and not just because being biracial makes me look like a completely separate third ethnicity), because then they'll try and pick and choose which race to highlight for whatever suits them.  E.g. If I have an opinion they like, then I'm one thing; if I have an opinion they don't like, I'm the other.  I hate it.", "deserves more updootd"]}
