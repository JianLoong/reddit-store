Does he know how busy DD is during your work hours compared to the hours he\u2019s currently doing it? I\u2019m going to go with NTA though, it doesn\u2019t sound reliable enough.", "NTA.  Not sure your husband thought of all the variables.  By doing DD only, he will be putting the entire family on the coattails and whims of the gas pumps, are gas prices really going down far enough to make it worth while.  Also, there are headwinds to the economy being  projected for next year and keeping employment does look better on the resume then nothing and you gain skills to use to transition into a better paying job.  With nothing there is no back up if DD fails or falters which is not a good place to be in.  This is a fight worth fighting, keep the job (but also look to switch to a better one if possible as well).\n\nedit to fix grammar.", "NTA, and also Door Dash and related services have a whole host of hidden costs and variables that could, at any time, change entirely at the whim of a state legislature or CEO's whim.... and likely will given how things are going across the country.

You don't mention benefits, but Door Dash doesn't have a health care plan.\n\nAlso don't know the hours here, but if you are working days, then he is not going to earn near as much at lunch time as he does in the evenings.\n\nIMO, he is just tired of caring for the kids.", "sounds like he just doesn\u2019t want to take care of the kids", "NTA.

DD should really not be the sole income for a full family! My bf and i would spend a full work day ( 8+ hours ) out in different areas and there were days that we didn't even make $100 after hours of working. it's great for a side gig and extra income but there is not a guaranteed amount of money he'd be making each day, it is just not worth the risk!", "\"I'm not comfortable with having my rent depend on the pockets of people and their tips.\"\n\nYou are smart, stay smart.  Keep your full time job, especially if it has medical benefits.  Does DD offer medical for full time?  I bet no.  Also, Uber and Lyft have changed their contracts drastically in the past year.

In my area, it seems to be dying off because the dashers are awful and a lot of restaurants are declining working with them.  What happens on the months that he's not getting as many orders or tips dry up?  That's the other thing, restaurant staff that are actually making the orders aren't getting a penny of those tips, which is turning many off from taking DD orders.", "No, you're not the AH.\n\nI get that daycare is expensive, and, prohibitively so for many people. \n\nInstead of DD, have your husband look for a full-time position on the shift opposite of yours.

Relying on the gig economy is incredibly unstable. Y'all have kids and need stability.", "NTA - DD is a pretty chancy way to provide for a famiy.  Your income might not be as much as possible, but I'm pretty sure there could be days when he makes almost nothing after costs of gas, etc., are factored in.  He needs to be thinking about some more stable form of employment for the long term because you are quite correct not wanting to depend on the kindness of strangers.", "NTA.  If in USA I assume you pay the health insurance with your job -   before you make a change he needs to show numbers and prove he can pay all the bills and have extra to cover emergencies.    DD in my area is not reliable.   We even have a gal that complains about working for DD on an area rant page.", "NTA. Sounds like your husband just doesn\u2019t want to be around your kids.

No way for him to DD, no way for either of you to get to a regular job.\n\nDD dumps almost all of the costs of doing business on the drivers (gas, buying and maintaining vehicles) and once you factor in those costs, there isn't much left to live on.\n\nYour car is probably your family's most valuable asset, and having a working car is the difference between working and unemployment for both of you.  Taking a job that will destroy that asset is utterly irresponsible and reckless.", "NTA\n\nKeep yourself in the workforce and protect your income.

PTO? Unemployment? etc???", "NTA. I DoorDash and there is no way it\u2019s sustainable as an income for even a single person. It is not reliable. It\u2019s great in a pinch if you.need money but I feel like I end up losing money in the end. I\u2019m just so poor and I already have one job and need the extra money now while I\u2019m looking into other options.

Medical? Dental? For you and your family?

Like, have you sat down and looked at all the incoming and outgoing money to see?", "NTA - That is a terrible plan. I am not even sure why he would WANT to do that.

Picks up around 5, and thanks to college town, can be busy till 2am. But Tuesday is a don't waste your time day cause no one is ordering, Monday and Wednesday are hit and miss. Thursday late at night is OK. Friday night is great. Saturday and Sunday are somewhat steady, but has slowed down recently. Sunday night is amazing and can go till 3am easily. But only one restaurant is open for delivery from DoorDash from midnight till whenever they close and they can choose to be carry out only. You have to learn your area well and know the staff of the places that you pick up from.", "That's interesting. I live in a major city and I suspect you'd get fewer late night orders because most bars and clubs have fast food outlets nearby and people don't have house parties as much because they live in smaller apartments. But on Sunday afternoons a lot of places become unavailable due to high demand and it can actually be really hard to get food on the apps on a Sunday morning/afternoon.", "I live in mid west population of our city of about 54,000 and majority is college and military. Since covid hit nothing is I open overnight and only two food places open past midnight, both can be ordered through DoorDash, but one delivers themselves unless driver is out other place is a revolving door for food to be delivered primarily within two miles of place.

NTA", "NTA, I did DD and Uber Eats full-time in a high COL area on-and-off over the course of a year while living on my own and it was barely enough to pay for myself. I could not do that to a wife and a child. It means your husband will not get any benefits, and it does not provide any opportunities for career growth. Taxes can be taken care of when he factors in gas, repairs/maintenance, and delivery equipment as business expenses, but it is not a good full-time work option. There are dry months depending on where you live (where I live, it is January-March) and the activity gets so slow that he will just be sitting around doing nothing while waiting for orders. During those dry months I eventually found work at a restaurant.\n\nIt is also a risk to his vehicle and his health by being on the road all the time.

And what you said was TRUE. You depending on peoples tips if that way. There is no way he is going to make as much money as you do (the gas/car cost for doing so is going to add up).

A food delivery service does not.", "So I've never had a year of doordash as my only income, but thousands of dollars does not seem like a reasonable amount of taxes to owe. Does your friend keep track of his miles? He should, any miles he's driving his own vehicle for work are deductible at the federal milage rate which makes a huge difference, plus any auto repairs he had to pay for due to using his car for work are (I believe) also tax deductible.", "I'm struggling to believe Doordash pays enough that a two person income household can just have one of the parents stop working tbh.\n\nAssuming it's tip based as well, your just about to hit Christmas.

How much it takes you in transportation versus how much he spends on insurance, gas etc (to do door dash).\n\nThis part is really important. People doing gig work tend to vastly overestimate how much they earn because of this. The \"hidden\" costs, such as increased wear and tear on the car requiring extra service, or increased insurance costs due to higher chances of collisions from being on the road so much. Or even just the odd schedules leading to more take-out food costs. That stuff all adds up, and it's costs being born directly by the workers, instead of the \"employers\" as it would be in regular jobs.", "NTA don't do it. Door dash is not that great. I do it on the side of my regular job to earn a little extra for unexpected build, but it sucks. I have to turn down dude's if orders a night because they only pay the 2.50 base pay. People don't like to to because they are already being charged an seen and a leg by door dash. Plus, you'll owe taxes on whatever he earns, the wear and tear on your car and the cost of gas...
