Not sure your husband thought of all the variables.  By doing DD only, he will be putting the entire family on the coattails and whims of the gas pumps, are gas prices really going down far enough to make it worth while.  Also, there are headwinds to the economy being  projected for next year and keeping employment does look better on the resume then nothing and you gain skills to use to transition into a better paying job.  With nothing there is no back up if DD fails or falters which is not a good place to be in.  This is a fight worth fighting, keep the job (but also look to switch to a better one if possible as well).\n\nedit to fix grammar.", "NTA, and also Door Dash and related services have a whole host of hidden costs and variables that could, at any time, change entirely at the whim of a state legislature or CEO's whim.... and likely will given how things are going across the country.

My bf and i would spend a full work day ( 8+ hours ) out in different areas and there were days that we didn't even make $100 after hours of working. it's great for a side gig and extra income but there is not a guaranteed amount of money he'd be making each day, it is just not worth the risk!", "\"I'm not comfortable with having my rent depend on the pockets of people and their tips.\"\n\nYou are smart, stay smart.  Keep your full time job, especially if it has medical benefits.  Does DD offer medical for full time?  I bet no.  Also, Uber and Lyft have changed their contracts drastically in the past year.

Your income might not be as much as possible, but I'm pretty sure there could be days when he makes almost nothing after costs of gas, etc., are factored in.  He needs to be thinking about some more stable form of employment for the long term because you are quite correct not wanting to depend on the kindness of strangers.", "NTA.  If in USA I assume you pay the health insurance with your job -   before you make a change he needs to show numbers and prove he can pay all the bills and have extra to cover emergencies.    DD in my area is not reliable.   We even have a gal that complains about working for DD on an area rant page.", "NTA. Sounds like your husband just doesn\u2019t want to be around your kids.

No way for him to DD, no way for either of you to get to a regular job.\n\nDD dumps almost all of the costs of doing business on the drivers (gas, buying and maintaining vehicles) and once you factor in those costs, there isn't much left to live on.\n\nYour car is probably your family's most valuable asset, and having a working car is the difference between working and unemployment for both of you.  Taking a job that will destroy that asset is utterly irresponsible and reckless.", "NTA\n\nKeep yourself in the workforce and protect your income.

Medical? Dental? For you and your family?

Like, have you sat down and looked at all the incoming and outgoing money to see?", "NTA - That is a terrible plan. I am not even sure why he would WANT to do that.

Also, he drives a beat up Chevy so he doesn't care too much about the extra wear.", "I deliver pizzas part time as an employee and $20 an hour in tips and drive out fees is pretty normal. Direct employees also get hourly wages, too, though we lose flexibility, of course.", "As someone who doordashes on the side, there is no punishment for declining low paying orders.  Acceptance rate genuinely does not matter and the best way to make money is to cherry pick (at least $2/mile, no orders under $6, etc)", "Just fyi, if your kids are young it's really not good for them to spend that much time every day in a car seat. It would make a lot more sense just to do an hour for the lunch rush if really needed and then dinner if he wanted.", "How would you quitting change his schedule then??", "Which only adds to the point of it's such a bad idea for him to be doing doordash. Like it's not only not giving a lot of money, with the amount of miles he's putting on his car it's actually costing you both him doing it so much.\n\nAnd the fact that he's driving around during not peak hours with the kids strapped in the back doesn't make sense in any way. You need to have a conversation about this", "What paperwork needs sorting out?", "It's not a reimbursement. It's a credit against gross income used to determine net taxable income. In other words, you are not taxed on that part of your gross income. But it is still out of pocket (just pre-tax, similar to insurance premiums taken by an employer before taxes are calculated).", "The rate is 62.5 cents per mile currently.  And if you have an \"average\" car or worse and are door dashing, you are pretty much screwed.  This is why so many door dashers drive older cheap economy cars.  These cars are almost completely depreciated and still get like 30mpg and usually are pretty cheap to repair.  \n\nThey are definitely gambling because when you have a car with 200k+ miles and you drive it 100+ miles per day in stop and go traffic, the car could have an expensive repair at any point.  And many of the people doing this don't have the savings to handle a major repair or replace their car.", "They don't pay more in taxes but their taxes aren't taken out of their pay so they have to pay the full year's worth of taxes when they file every year so they pay a year at once. Big chunk of change if you didn't plan for it!", "Indeed, and is all so not engaging or good for them mentally.\n\nLike it doesn't make financial sense for him to be doing it at off peak times anyway, and him doing it at the detriment of the kids' wellbeing is shitty", "To me it sounds like he just doesn't want to be home with the kids and doesn't care that he's making less money as long as he can be out of the house..", "Exactly. Sure, some people order in lunch, but a few hours over the lunch rush is not going to make the whole day of her lost wages worth it.", "OP, this is important- do you have business insurance on the vehicle? Because if be gets in a wreck while dashing and insurance finds out, they may choose to deny coverage because the car was being used to business purposes. You should talk to your insurance provider if you haven't.", "This is incorrect. You actually pay more, not in income tax, but in employment taxes that are paid 50% by an employer when you're an employee.", "Federal self employment tax is 15%. It has to be paid quarterly. Failure to pay quarterly results in substantial penalties. This is separate from income tax.\n\nYou may be able to deduct 50% of the self employment tax against your income tax.", "I think it depends on the state. I live in one of the highest taxed state on income so I think thats why it was more. It was a huge surprise and the total rate of tax was higher than my W2 position because I had both for that tax year. You pay a self-employment tax on top of the tiered income tax, that a w2 employer would otherwise be paying on your behalf. Though if doing DD probably more things you can claim such as gas etc.", "He is talking out of his ass because he doesn\u2019t want to do childcare.", "He likely isn\u2019t working under his own SSN. That\u2019s my hunch. USCIS wouldn\u2019t be cool with gig work vs. a regular job.", "Yeah... reading OP's comments he really sounds like a slightly older version of those kids who watch Markiplier or PewDiePie videos and decide they want to be YouTube stars when they grow up.", "Which is even more ridiculous.", "You do pay extra in the form of the employer half of social security and medicare.  That works out to about 7.65%.  But unless you made a poor car choice you get to deduct more than your actual expenses since the standard mileage rate is currently 62.5 cents per mile, which is about the average cost to own and drive a vehicle.  But if you chose a vehicle that costs well below average it may only cost you say 20 cents per mile to own and operate.  So between these two things you end up paying a higher tax rate on a smaller taxable income for the same gross pay vs a regular W2 job.\n\nSo, you may be paying more in taxes, or less in taxes, or about the same.  It all depends on the specifics of your situation.", "Employers pay half of the FICA tax.  If you have to pay it all then that is another 6% of your income.", "\"Proper insurance\"\n\nOP, that's a big one-  what does your policy cover? If he got into a car accident while Door Dashing, your auto insurer could find out he was engaged in work activities at the time and might not pay a claim.", "Could he be using OP's SSN? That would be a very bad plan, from what I understand, although from what I understand, ever working with someone else's is not a good plan. Along with full time DD.", "He could have an itin or ssn (you don't have to be a citizen to have a ssn to work /pay income taxes)"]}
