Damn I need to rethink my career choices", "NTA - don\u2019t quit. Door Dash is not going to pay that much extra. I would understand if you wanted to stay home initially and this was his alternative, but you quitting won\u2019t likely work out in the end.", "How much research has he done? Does he know how busy DD is during your work hours compared to the hours he\u2019s currently doing it? I\u2019m going to go with NTA though, it doesn\u2019t sound reliable enough.", "NTA.  Not sure your husband thought of all the variables.  By doing DD only, he will be putting the entire family on the coattails and whims of the gas pumps, are gas prices really going down far enough to make it worth while.  Also, there are headwinds to the economy being  projected for next year and keeping employment does look better on the resume then nothing and you gain skills to use to transition into a better paying job.  With nothing there is no back up if DD fails or falters which is not a good place to be in.  This is a fight worth fighting, keep the job (but also look to switch to a better one if possible as well).\n\nedit to fix grammar.", "NTA, and also Door Dash and related services have a whole host of hidden costs and variables that could, at any time, change entirely at the whim of a state legislature or CEO's whim.... and likely will given how things are going across the country. It might be moderately successful if managed right, but it's sorta like hopping out of a perfectly sound kayak to board a sinking johnboat. Sure, it's somewhat larger, but not by enough to outweigh that big ol hole with water filling it up.", "NTA.\n\nYour income is more dependable.  You don't mention benefits, but Door Dash doesn't have a health care plan.\n\nAlso don't know the hours here, but if you are working days, then he is not going to earn near as much at lunch time as he does in the evenings.\n\nIMO, he is just tired of caring for the kids.", "sounds like he just doesn\u2019t want to take care of the kids", "NTA. Nothing is guaranteed about DD for income. I would want to see numbers on paper and a full list of pros and cons and who is really benefitting most from a major change like that.\n\nWhat about insurance and other benefits?", "NTA!!! DD should really not be the sole income for a full family! My bf and i would spend a full work day ( 8+ hours ) out in different areas and there were days that we didn't even make $100 after hours of working. it's great for a side gig and extra income but there is not a guaranteed amount of money he'd be making each day, it is just not worth the risk!", "\"I'm not comfortable with having my rent depend on the pockets of people and their tips.\"\n\nYou are smart, stay smart.  Keep your full time job, especially if it has medical benefits.  Does DD offer medical for full time?  I bet no.  Also, Uber and Lyft have changed their contracts drastically in the past year.  They pay their drivers <40% now compared to >60% last year.\n\nDD could go belly up anytime, or do what Uber did and cut pay.  Remember to factor in benefits with pay when making these decisions.  In his off time, can he work on a trade skill?\n\nEdit: Sorry, NTA", "INFO: If he Door Dashes while you're at work (presumably he takes the kids wit him?), and then swaps kids when you're done, does this mean he drops them off with you and then continues doing more Door Dash?", "NTA, Door Dash is a very hot/cold job.  In my area, it seems to be dying off because the dashers are awful and a lot of restaurants are declining working with them.  What happens on the months that he's not getting as many orders or tips dry up?  That's the other thing, restaurant staff that are actually making the orders aren't getting a penny of those tips, which is turning many off from taking DD orders.", "No, you're not the AH.\n\nI get that daycare is expensive, and, prohibitively so for many people. \n\nInstead of DD, have your husband look for a full-time position on the shift opposite of yours. If you work 9-5, have your husband look for a job that is graveyard (11pm-7am). \n\nIn today's world, there is absolutely no way, no how, I would give up a full-time job with the alternative being a gig job like DD.", "NTA. Relying on the gig economy is incredibly unstable. Y'all have kids and need stability.", "NTA - DD is a pretty chancy way to provide for a famiy.  Your income might not be as much as possible, but I'm pretty sure there could be days when he makes almost nothing after costs of gas, etc., are factored in.  He needs to be thinking about some more stable form of employment for the long term because you are quite correct not wanting to depend on the kindness of strangers.", "NTA.  If in USA I assume you pay the health insurance with your job -   before you make a change he needs to show numbers and prove he can pay all the bills and have extra to cover emergencies.    DD in my area is not reliable.   We even have a gal that complains about working for DD on an area rant page.", "NTA. Sounds like your husband just doesn\u2019t want to be around your kids. Might wanna dig into that (in therapy)", "NTA\n\nDo you have enough money for a replacement car?\n\nIf you quit your job, and he's busy wearing out your only vehicle doing DD, your family will be helpless when it inevitably breaks down.  No way for him to DD, no way for either of you to get to a regular job.\n\nDD dumps almost all of the costs of doing business on the drivers (gas, buying and maintaining vehicles) and once you factor in those costs, there isn't much left to live on.\n\nYour car is probably your family's most valuable asset, and having a working car is the difference between working and unemployment for both of you.  Taking a job that will destroy that asset is utterly irresponsible and reckless.", "NTA\n\nKeep yourself in the workforce and protect your income. And bahaha, it's always funny when men figure out that it isn't all bonbons and daytime television being a stay-at-home parent. \n\nAnd some simple math would suggest that in a week of 168 hours, you're working 40, leaving 128 available for him to work fulltime. \n\nDoorDash seems to be a good side gig, but as reliable income it would seem to have its shortcomings. \n\nDo either jobs offer benefits? PTO? Unemployment? etc???", "NTA. I DoorDash and there is no way it\u2019s sustainable as an income for even a single person. It is not reliable. It\u2019s great in a pinch if you.need money but I feel like I end up losing money in the end. I\u2019m just so poor and I already have one job and need the extra money now while I\u2019m looking into other options. But it\u2019s costing me money ultimately.\n\nIf he wants to work full time and you stay at home I think that\u2019s fine but he should get a different job then instead as the full time job.", "Does DoorDash provide benefits? Medical? Dental? For you and your family? I'm assuming your full time job does. \n\nThis is a case of a \"bird in the hand\" (your job with a guaranteed, steady salary) being worth well over \"two in the bush\" (unsteady income with the barest of potential of increasing).\n\nKeep being sensible.\nNTA", "I do doordash and I enjoy it because it gives me great flexibility while I'm in school. Since there are no health benefits and im considered self-employed, I personally would not bet my family's welfare on it.", "Info: does he have health insurance through you or through Door Dash? What about the kids?", "NTA ask him if it was you doing DD would he quit to let a family swing on delivery wages and tips ? If he cant see where his plan has some issues then it's probably part of a larger set of issues", ">I told him that I have no issues with pulling extra shifts at work but he refused. He says he can make more money dashing vs me working more hours.\n\nINFO: Is that actually true?  Like, have you sat down and looked at all the incoming and outgoing money to see?", "NTA - That is a terrible plan. I am not even sure why he would WANT to do that. Unless he just doesn't like caring for his own kids? \n\nDoor dash may make you a couple extra hundred some weeks - but a few hundred less other weeks. And with ZERO reliability. Having a full time job where you have an agreed up hourly rate and a guaranteed number of hours allows you to actually budget and plan.", "NTA - He's naive at best. What happens when the one family car breaks down and Door Dash is the only source of income? It doesn't sound like you have a large emergency fund for repairs and to hold you over.", "NTA. DoorDash is not a reliable income to feed a family on, even if he did do it full time.", "It really sounds like he just doesn't want to take care if the children so he wants you to be the full time parent.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Casually, as I have a very well paying FT job with amazing benefits. I see discussions and questions ALL the time asking if its possible to make a \"full time\" living reselling. The issue I see and always address, is full time will not be the same for everyone. FT for some may be that their SO/spouse, has a very well paying job, with benefits, and they consider FT to be working 40 hours a week, but maybe only making 1K or so a month. Which may be enough for them.\n\nothers, like myself, would need to make WAY more than that, enough to cover not only my salary but ALL my benefits. and I am paid regularly, every 2 weeks.

He just works different shifts.   \n\n\nI am assuming you have a standard 9-5 job which means husband would have lots of hours at night to work DD. Is it ideal but many married people work different shifts because they can't afford child care so one of them has to be home for the kids.\n\nIt is never smart to quit a \\*real\\* job. Most jobs come with some form of benefits - the most basic would be unemployment since DD is an independent contractor job with no benefits. Also hopefully you are on a job that has some road to advancement - learning some skills - getting a better job whereas DD is a complete dead end and really is just meant to be a side hustle or a temporary thing", "Swear, DD is the cure to all of our problems and those regular 9-5s just aren't cutting it these days smh", "Thank you for saying that. He was really starting to make me feel crazy when I was refusing to agree with him on his plan", "There are days where he'll make a good amount in a couple of hours and days where he doesn't even when he's out till 10pm. Sometimes the app is good and sometimes the app has bugs. On my off days I go with him so I see first hand how it goes. That's what makes me feel uneasy about quitting my job.

I've been at my job for a couple of years now so when we moved into our new apartment my job is what solidified it. There was a week where I was called to do some holdovers after my shift ended. I pulled in nearly $1000 after taxes with that one weekly check. So it's not like I can't make enough to help out. He's just trying to load it all on himself.", "This!!!

He knows that it's happening but it's kind of an \"that's happening in other places and isn't happening here\" kind of thing", "This!!! I tried bringing this up with him but he was more focused on me not agreeing to quitting my job. He made it a point to say WHY would I be okay with quitting in order for him to work a normal job but not okay to quitting for him to do DD full time. I said because of the stability. Everything was just going over his head", "I'm frustrated because I'm trying to meet him half way on this but he wants 100% control over this. I am capable of working extra hours, he's just not willing to let it be possible. It is maddeninggggg like bruh, we struggling because you want to be able to say how much you do. We're married, you don't need to be like that. I'm trying to help carry the load my guy. \n\nDefinitely keeping my job. It feels like financial suicide if I don't. I'm not shitting on DD, it has saved us many times but I'm also not going to act like it's a safe bet.\n\nMy job is crap benefits wise but the hours are always there if I need them. DD as far as I know has no benefits but I could be wrong.", "He's pushing  DD so hard because it's his only option. We're in the process of getting his paperwork sorted out so he can't apply at a regular job currently. I told him that I wouldn't mind quitting my job when he got his paperwork sorted out and worked at a stable place but I think I struck a nerve more than anything. So to him I'm the problem financially and DD is the cure all vs being okay with me doing more hours at my own job", "I brought up the unreliability and he was quick to mention other people online who make much more than he does because they do it full time. He doesn't mention how most of them are single, childless/ have no pets/ spouses or have other income from their social media accounts.

I strongly suggest that you not do this, or at least fully understand the seasonal cash flow of the business before you commit your family's financial future. Because your husband may not realize this, I'll tentatively say NAH.\n\nEdit: I just saw further down that he's been watching DD channels on YouTube. Those channels are *very* optimistic in general, and you may be fighting an uphill battle in 'deprogramming' him, for lack of a better term, with real numbers and statistics. \n\nBest of luck to you.", "INFO: Does your husband have any other marketable skills that might be more lucrative long term? Cuz that would be different. As it stands, your def NTA.", "He can do DD full time opposite your shifts.

If it does then it's a lot more than the money involved.", "That's the real kicker here. Eventually his car will need service because of the accelerated use. Even beyond gas, what happens when you need the 800 bucks for a set of new tires, or a few thousand for a new transmission? Typically the Door Dash economy averages out to only slightly above minimum wage over the long term. There have been a whole host of studies on it from impartial research institutions.", "Why not actually jot down the numbers.\n\nCompare it to his worst days against your guaranteed income. At the end of the end of the, you need to compare it against the worst since it\u2019s not guaranteed and need to see if you can even survive. \n\nInclude ALL your benefits. Also subtract the costs.

It will be easier for him to jump back into Door Dash than you into a career. Are you in a career field or working hourly retail or something?", "For now.  While I do think that delivery services are here to stay (which I'm actually ALL for), the market is saturated with companies and drivers.  The income he's making now isn't sustainable long run.  If it was just you two, the risk is ok. But with kids?  To me, that's way too much of a risk to take.", "Oh that's frustrating. It sounds like he wants to do what he wants to do, without realizing the impact it will have on everyone else.", "Is it an immigration thing?", "Facts! I'll bring this up and we can sit down and actually map this all out on paper, thanks for that idea. \n\nHe's seeing others online vlogging how much they make dashing and not actually looking at how they're getting income from sponsors, views online or don't have children, loans to pay off, insurance, car payments, etc. \n\ngas wise we're looking at me filling my tank up once a week at around $55 vs him filling up every single day or sometimes 2x a day. Not sure how much his tank costs"]}
