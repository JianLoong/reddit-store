But while she isn't choosing to wet herself, by refusing to wear any sort of pad or diaper she is choosing to wet the bed.

If she's too sick to even change the sheets OP is likely doing a lot of caretaking of her and like all the household tasks already. May also be the only one working to support the household? (Unclear.) OP isn't abandoning her or refusing to help her, he's asking that she take a bit of personal responsibility to make things less hard on him where she can. I get it's humiliating for her to have to wear adult diapers, but it's probably hamulating for OP to  have to change her pee every day beacuse she refuses to wear them. And she should be more ashamed of wetting her joint bed and making her partner clean it up every day then of having the personal responsibility to cover herself up to prevent it. \n\nIt was harsh to say I agree, but that's the way she is acting like a child. Not by wetting herself, but by refusing to take any personal responsibility for herself and her mess when she could.

You were very wise and loving.", "Thank you so much for your kindness! :-)", "Thank you for all you do! :-)", "Thanks! It's a dignity thing. You can also say Depends, like the name brand.", "What you said is just as good! Thanks! :-)", "He said she's too sick to clean, not sick of cleaning. I agree though, ESH.", "I don't get it, is this a really old post in the above link. Its pretty much word from word of OPs post. Have they just revamped it and put on aita?", "Whaaaaaaaaaat the heck", "Because there is a previous post with the genders reversed. The OP did exactly the same thing. The responses to her were much better.", "Yes, the existence of anyone who has double standards means every single commentor on this post is sexist. I didn't know sexism was transitive like that, thanks for the enlightenment", "the og post a lot of ppl said she was also an asshole...", "Nope. Not playing your little game as I had nothing to do with nor commented on your original post.", "Please check your sexism.", "I don't understand. Are you linking this specifically to people who voted the other way or just any yta verdict?", "Please fuck off", "For sure. AITA commenters are notorious for their misandrist views, and this exposes them here.", "It definitely is. All that was changed was the genders, and it got a totally different response. It honestly looks to be someone's experiment proving how biased people are when it comes to gender.", "Obviously.", "Do ya think?!?", "I\u2019m honestly not surprised at all.  I\u2019ve seen a lot of these go the woman\u2019s way in petty disputes (thinking long run).  I can only count on the guy getting a \u201cNTA\u201d verdict when the woman in the hypothetical post does some off the wall shit, is crazy vindictive, abusive or threatening\u2026.. you get my drift.\n\nIt\u2019s much more interesting to see split responses when you do see a woman ask something like this though\n\n\nIn my personal observation.  Not on all the time. Not trying to offend/piss anyone off, too tired to argue.", "If it means anything, I do agree with your assessment. I remember being pretty shocked at the responses to the previous post.", "Are you aware that this is a copy of a previously written post with the genders flipped? Funnily enough, the majority of responses hesitated to call the wife the AH when the husband refused briefs. They were more sympathetic to her for having to deal with the situation. But in this scenario, the wife refuses briefs and the responses are more sympathetic to her for her condition than the husband who is dealing with it. Interesting, huh?", "Thank you and you too :)", "But the other post she didn\u2019t berate\nBoyfriend and tell people. Even if it\u2019s fake, the context of the post is different.", "It's a gender swap post. It's happening a lot recently with people taking a post where women are voted NTA or at least ESH and then they'll make the same post but with a man to prove that the response will be drastically different. \n\nI hate to say it but these people are right, there's a gender bias on AITA. Every time I serve a gender swap post, the man is always voted TA when the woman previously was not.", "Because this is a repost with just the genders swapped. In both cases the majority of responders are siding with the wife.", "Double standards. They are harsher on today's OP. The previous one was female. I remember the story.", "Don\u2019t forget all the frustrated short fiction writers. Some real wild imaginations in here!", "You think every nurse with access to the internet thinks and acts in lockstep with one another? Ok.", "Story of this sub.", "That was your crucial mistake: expecting reasonableness for AITA posters.", "Awesome. Well done if true", "Its working", "Surprised?", "No worries! Thanks!", "Why are you speaking for her.  She seems quite capable", "I beg your pardon? It certainly wasn't meant that way.", "Yes, I saw that here awhile ago. It's very interesting.", "\ud83d\udc95", "yes she did lol. it's exactly the same with extremely slight wording changes. She still snapped at the husband and told the kids when they came in.", "She literally says she \u201cwent off\u201d and the kids heard the \u201cfuss\u201d in the other post. So yes she yelled. Are we seriously making excuses for the obvious gender bias in this thread?", "The context is exactly the same. Crazy how people give woman way more leniency than men even when evidence is staring them in the face. You're being willfully ignorant", "It's ESH. Wife is staring at the wall and clearly depressed asf, but she also is not behavior rationally. He should have never dragged the kids into it, though, that was going way too far.", "So you don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it to edit your own response to reflect this? \n\nOn another recent post in this sub the same thing happened. The top commenter added an edit acknowledging that a) the OP wasn\u2019t genuine, and b) they were now aware that they needed to examine their own biases. I don\u2019t know if b) applies to you, but as it is you\u2019re still giving OP a judgment as if they\u2019re real when in reality they are almost certainly doing a purposeful repost to examine how we answer differently based on our own gender biases.", "You are being deliberately obtuse. Do better.", "The mattress is a concern for everyone's health.\n\nESH. He should have asked her to just wear it for a night or two to get something she's more comfortable with. \n\nBut, even with some medical Shiz happening, she's being a stickler.\n\nThere's no compromise here and everyone is frustrated. Everyone needs to calm tf down", "Yes, to support her. Support being the key word. What she is asking him to do is ignore the troubling signs of mental and physical health decline and instead enable her in pissing  the bed."]}
