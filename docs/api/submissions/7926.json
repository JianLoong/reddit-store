I have never heard of anyone asking their partner to drive to meet them on breaks and lunches just to sit in a car with them and talk about work. Added to that, that he threatens you with some sort of revenge if you don't is also worrying. These are red flags in a relationship and I have to ask, why did you marry him if he's like this? It's super controlling.", "NTA.\n\nAlso am I missing something? Bc if he wants to see you why doesn\u2019t he just go home for lunch??", "NTA \n\nThat\u2019s some next level codependency on his part, he\u2019s an adult that should be able to eat his lunch without someone holding his hand.", "NTA what a strange man.", "NTA. He's being rather childish about this. Especially the part where he says passive-aggressive things when you say you can't visit him.\n\nDo you think it would help to set up pre-arranged work lunches in advance? Like, 2-3 times a week, you come and do lunch with him? And that he won't ask you to come visit him any other time?", "[DUDE. NTA](https://www.loveisrespect.org/)", "Info: How long have you been married? This sounds like a newlywed dispute. Lol", "NTA. It's so strange that he threatens to not see you...but then doesn't want to see you even when you do go see him? How can you threaten not to go visit someone for lunch that you never visit for lunch anyway?", "NTA. Although, I do think its very sweet he wants to spend more time with you, its definitely not something to be upset about when it can\u2019t happen. The \u201cI\u2019ll remember that or I won\u2019t see you\u201d is ridiculous and childish. The threats doesn\u2019t even matter anyways from what you said he doesn\u2019t even see you or bring you lunch. He\u2019s a big boy and needs to start acting like it.", "Oh please. NTA. You don\u2019t have to plan your days off around catering to your husbands whims during his short work breaks. It\u2019s nice that he wants to spend time with you but expecting you to drop everything to come see him? No way. Maybe occasionally this would be sweet but not at the time. If you\u2019re feeling like compromise maybe you could face time or something, that way you can still do your own thing within reason, like if you\u2019re doing the dishes or whatever", "I am confused, because\n1. Why not prepare a lunchbox he can take to work? \n2. Are there no co-workers he can have lunch with?\n3. Why do you drive to his working place if you really dislike it so much and he never returns your favors. Stop doing it. \nAltogether this sounds rather mixed up and, please forgive me, immature.", "NTA - I would have said N A H but he's being snippy about it, but in general this is much too cute for this subreddit. He wants your company (and to be brought food) but he's being a pain about it. No, you're not obligated to do it all the time, but it sounds nice occasionally. Talk it out at a calm moment and come to a compromise that works.", "NTA\n\nI was going to say NAH at first because I think it's cute and sweet that he wants to eat lunch with you, but you described him as being passive aggressive when you refuse and that's not okay. He can ask for your time - not demand it. He sounds controlling and or/co-dependent and either way needs therapy and a behavior change ASAP.", "You\u2019re not his Mommy. \n\nAnd spending time together can be romantic WHEN IT\u2019S NOT DEMANDED.\n\nOP please find some way to balance your relationship out before it goes too deep with this misogynistic and controlling drama. \n\nNTA", "NTA you gotta say no and stick to it. Honestly his behavior seems weird since he never comes to you", "NTA, he can bloody well put in the same effort or shut his trap", "Umm just slightly strange but on the other hand after reading all these cheating posts on Reddit about work affairs and stuff might make me feel good if he wanted me to come around his work place while i am off \u263a\ufe0f", "NTA. I think it\u2019s a nice gesture at your discretion if you\u2019re up for it, but set your boundaries.  Tell him what you\u2019re comfortable with\u2026 whether that\u2019s once a week, month, etc.  You can comfortably explain that even though you\u2019re off work, you\u2019re using those other times to catch up on errands, housework, etc.", "How old are you guys?\n12?\n\n\nJesus....", "YTA, he clearly wants to spend time with you, maybe show his coworkers he is loved.

And if I say no, I don't really want to, he asks for lunch, then for his last break also (he works 12s)", "That sounds like an awesome compromise. I didn't even realize that I could just schedule time to visit him and have it be an expectation, so he doesn't have to ask for it every day.", "We have been married for almost a year, but we have been together for 4.5 years.

Besides that if she doesn\u2019t give in to his requests he threatens that he won\u2019t come see her or to remember that the next time she wants something! Thats a red flag and extremely petty. How can you threaten to not come see her when he is not doing that anyway nor is she requesting it? If he wants to see her that bad he can literally drive home, same thing. If shes off, she should be spending the day the way she wants. He can either drive home or pack a lunch, that simple. Call her and talk about work is another option. \n\nIf he was making the request and leaving it at that, it would be fine\u2026. He just misses her, but the threat at the end is childish.

There\u2019s absolutely no reason he can\u2019t be packing snacks for work and coming home on his lunches to hang out with you (heck I\u2019m sure he could come home for lunch everyday if he wanted). \n\nBut expecting you to do all that and not being able to return the favour (but also threatening to not? that part is weird) shows a clear lack of respect for you and your time.", "Disagree it\u2019s a silly request.
