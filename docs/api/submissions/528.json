My father in law moved out first and stayed with us starting in February. In July my mother in law and  Emily's youngest sister moved too. So in our two bedroom apartment we had 5 people. This is when they were saving up for an apartment. At the end of August, Emily's other two siblings came out. Shannon's rent was going up, and little did I know she  joined them moving.

I said that Shannon barely talks to me on the few times I've given her a ride to work. I said I don't know how well Shannon drives on the freeway, and it's not my job to fix Shannon's problems.

Whilst it is a generous gesture to support family and friends in times of need, it\u2019s not an obligation, especially for an undefined length of time.\nDecide what you want, then follow through with it. I don\u2019t imagine Shannon is listed on your mortgage, marriage certificate or car insurance, and I don\u2019t see why she feels entitled to be treated as if she were. She sounds toxic to me. Whilst you\u2019re an incredibly patient person, there has to be an end in sight. Get her out of your house if you\u2019ve had enough, and don\u2019t let her back in. For any reason.

It's been a long road with improvements along the way.

Basically this last run broke her of that.", "Ummm.... no. No, you didn't. Your wife needs to grow a spine herself -- it should have been up to her to tell her friend that she needed to move out by X date. That's part of taking in a friend... you're then the one who has to deal with telling them the hard parts. \n\nYour wife has been demanding an unreasonable degree of deference from you both to her friend. You need to talk to her about it, because that is unsustainable. \n\nIt's not just that Shannon needs to have an exit date, although she does. It's also that your wife needs to be able to accept that her friend will not always be delighted with everything your wife does, and that is still okay. Right now, she is bending over backwards to avoid the faintest possibility of making Shannon upset with her, just as she was when she made you stage a breakup rather than facing her friend directly and acknowledging that she, just as much as you, needed Shannon to move out!! But that's not grounds for a sustainable relationship, either with you or with Shannon. \n\nFriends have to be able to draw boundaries with each other, and right now, it looks like your wife absolutely can't or won't. That's the biggest problem you have. What you need to do to placate Shannon, or when Shannon leaves, is less important than the fact that your wife feels such a need to placate Shannon at all.", "Most welcome  \n\nHere's the situation as I understand it now- feel free to copy paste this as I think it's a bit clearer.  I'm writing it from your POV to make that easier.  \n\n-----\n\nShannon's work is a 10 minute drive away with no freeway travel.  My work is 30+ minutes away on the freeway, more if there's traffic.  \nSo I let Shannon take my car to work.  MIL let me borrow her car, as they've also had issues with Shannon and MIL trusts me to drive her car on the freeway.  \n\nToday my wife is telling me I'm the asshole for doing this.  My wife says I should have let Shannon borrow my car, but had Shannon drop me off at my work and then go to her own work.  My wife would then borrow MIL's car and drive it for the day.  I'd be picked up from work by my wife later and Shannon would drive my car back home.  \n\nI wasn't comfortable with this for a few reasons.  First, I have no idea how well Shannon drives and I don't trust her to take my car on the freeway for an ~hour round trip.  Second, on the times I've driven Shannon around she barely says two words to me the whole trip.  And that leaves me stranded at work, depending on my wife or Shannon for a ride home.  \nI feel it's not my job to fix Shannon's problems.  I married Emily and as such I will take care of her as much as I can.  But that doesn't extend to Shannon- Shannon needs to act like an adult and figure her own shit out.  If Emily wants to give of her own resources to help Shannon that's fine, but I don't feel I should be the one stuck with no car because of Shannon.  \n\n-----\n\nIf I understand correctly, Emily was upset because in this whole exchange Emily was left without a car.  And she felt you should have made sure that as your wife she was left with a car- you should sacrifice for your wife.  \n\nBased on that, I'll reiterate my original NTA.  \n\nIf I understand correctly, you'd prefer Shannon wasn't staying with you at all.  And while you'd love to get rid of Shannon, doing so would be very difficult without literally kicking her out and your wife isn't ready to have that conversation with her.  \n\nI would suggest you have THAT conversation with your wife.  Tell her this- you love her very much and you want her to always be happy and you will sacrifice to make HER happy.  You are NOT interested in giving up anything to keep Shannon afloat, as far as you're concerned she's a mooch and she's taking advantage of the two of you just like she did two years ago when you had to fake a breakup just to get rid of her.  \n\nSince you want no part of this, since it's Emily that insists on helping Shannon against your protests, you don't think it's right that you be the one left without a car for Shannon's benefit.  You think that since Emily insisted on sacrificing to help Shannon, Emily should be the one sacrificing, namely being without a car for the day.  Not you.  And as far as you're concerned, the way Emily wants to do it isn't sacrificing for her, it's sacrificing for Shannon, because if Shannon wasn't around you'd drive your car and Emily would drive MILs and there'd be no problem.  \nYour preference would be to tell Shannon to call herself an Uber (on her own dime), or ideally move her out entirely so she starts handling her own problems like an adult rather than offloading those problems for you and Emily to solve for her.  \n\nAnd while this may seem adversarial, you want your wife to know you're always with her.  You don't share her priorities where Shannon is concerned, but you love HER, which is why you tolerate giving up so much for Shannon as you have already (especially the privacy of your own home).  So you want her to know that if she ever does get sick of Shannon, you are happy to be the bad guy, and be the one who demands Shannon leaves.  She can lie and say she wants Shannon to stay and you'll pretend to go along with it, so you're the bad guy and Emily can save the friendship.", "You're a good guy. I have seen a phrase on Reddit a lot. You don't have to set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. You have done a lot to help a bunch of extra people. Time to get back in balance. Talk to your wife. Set a reasonable deadline - 30 to 60 days and everyone else needs to be out your house and stay out. Tell the dad to take his daughter with him.", "Good that you are aware. It is also possible that she has a hard time saying no to people, so it maybe a pattern.", "I completely agree, part of the reason for this post is to show what the well \"average\" person would think about the situation. By average I mean average for reddit lol.", "Well the good news is that all of her family (mom dad and 3 other kids moved) into their 4 bedroom apartment in the first week of September. The only one left is the now broken down car friend.", "This very much. It's gotten drastically better over the 7 years we've been together. She says no to even me much more over the years.", "So call her Dad and tell him he forgot one. Good luck \ud83e\udd1e.", "Lol", "lol love it, thanks!"]}
