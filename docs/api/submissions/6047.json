I have a younger sister ( 19f). My mother passed away shortly after my sister was born. This really affected my dad and he buried himself in work. So basically, I raised my sister instead. Even now she has a meh relationship with dad and jokes that I am actually her second father. \n\nMy wife is pregnant with our first child. My sister was visiting us last week and she said \" I am so excited to be an aunt or more like a big sister \". Suddenly my wife told her \" you can only be an aunt because this is his first real child\". My sister was shocked and said she was just joking. Here I was so pissed like I have never been before and told my wife wtf is wrong with her infront of my sister. After I drive my sister home, I asked my wife why would she say that? She said that she just wanted to support me . She knew I sacrificed a lot of my younger years to raise my sister and she needs to understand that at the end of the day she is not my real daughter and priorities now will be for my first child. I was stunned and told her you can't possibly think this is the way to support me     and that she showed me a side in her I have never seen before and I don't know if we can recover from this. She has apologized several times since but I am still have not moved past this.

Is it possible your wife has been worrying that you will make time for the new baby and that comment just hit right on the mark of that anxiety? Reading this it sounds like your willing to leave your wife and unborn child over it, which does make it seem like they aren't as important. No discussion you've checked out and \"can't come back from this\" is a lot.", "NTA but it seems like you two have talked and she has apologized a lot for it. I wouldn\u2019t hold a grudge over this.

Your wife is clearly feeling complex emotions on top of normal hormones during pregnancy. You can defend your sister/daughter AND reassure your wife of the role you intend to play as a father to your unborn child.

It sounds like your wife was unnecessarily blunt, and it sounds like you flew off the handle.\n\nI can understand your wife feeling a little defensive of your time and energy as a father; she needs you to focus on raising your son, and not your grown sister. But, she should have expressed this to you in private, not rudely blurted it out to your sister.\n\nYou have a right to be upset with your wife, but she has apologized.  If you feel that her apology is sincere, then accept it and move on.  It sounds like your wife isn't malicious toward your sister, but probably feeling insecure and hormonal, so cut her some slack.  Saying you may never recover from it is pretty dramatic.\n\nTalk it out with your wife and get your relationship back on track.  You have a baby on the way.", "NTA for the comment to her - sounded out of line. However, if she has apologized and genuinely sees your side now, you will be TA if you don't let it go", "NTA - But talk this over. I understand that you are very protective of your little sister, and you are an amazing brother and person for being her support in life. What your wife said was out of line, but it seems like it really came from a place of her misunderstanding how best to support you and she seems more than willing to listen to you now and reconcile. She has apologized profusely, trust in her enough to grow from this and do better. You can\u2019t drop someone you love over what sounds like an honest, if hurtful, mistake.\n\nYou two are probably both feeling super stressed out. Look into marriage counseling to help get you both on the same page and communicating properly, and so you can work out your feelings here.", "In all likelihood, part of what attracted your wife to you was your loyalty to your little sister. \n\nWhat your wife said could have been taken different ways depending on the way she said it and the relationship she already has with your sister.

I raised my little sister too and ever since I was 15 she has given me Mother\u2019s Day cards. \n\nHowever, that is not healthy, that is not right. My therapist has helped me work to come out of a caregiver role with my sister because that is the HEALTHY THING TO DO. \n\nI would be upset if my spouse said that too (in the way that I\u2019m imagining it), especially to my sister. but it sounds like your wife thought that you are done playing caregiver to your sister and instead of making you answer to your sister- which you might be uncomfortable with, she answered for you. \n\nThere have been several times that I answered for my partner to his family because I know it would be easier for me to answer than for him to answer them. It IS a kind of support. \n\nIf it wasn\u2019t welcome then you should explain that. But it sounds like you need to decide where your priorities are. Your wife assumes it\u2019s her and your child. And she wanted to support you by making sure your sister knew that, without you having to say so. \n\nWhy are you ready to give up on her so easily even though she has apologized multiple times? \n\nIt sounds like something is wrong with you or your relationships (to sister AND wife), or you are leaving out important details.", "NTA.\n\nI am the elder child forced to raise younger siblings.

Your wife obviously knows how you feel about your sister, and knows how much you\u2019ve raised her. I\u2019m assuming she was aware this was a package deal when y\u2019all got together. I too would be mind blown that a partner who would know what I went through to raise my siblings (who btw is what we call an adult teenager, kid isn\u2019t even 20) would ever dream that this would be an appropriate thing to say. I guess it can be explained by pregnancy hormones, but that\u2019s not an excuse. And her apology should be also towards your sister, not just you. What if your sister stops coming to you with important things she otherwise would have? What happens if she finds herself in a bind and doesn\u2019t reach out to you out of fear of burdening you now? Your wife needs to understand that intention doesn\u2019t negate impact and she needs to correct the negative impact she had\n\nI\u2019ve been pregnant multiple times and have let the hormones get the best of me at times, but that\u2019s never excused whatever negative behavior I\u2019ve engaged in and accountability means apologizing to everyone, not just the one person that\u2019s the easiest (ie you)", "Super overreaction imo.

The relationship you have with your sister, although it was unfair of your dad to put the responsibility on you, sounds like it\u2019s turned into a beautiful relationship, and your baby will be lucky to have your sister around. Of course your child will be a priority but there is nothing wrong with feeling like a second dad toward your sister, and your wife needs to understand that your relationship with your sister takes nothing at all away from your being a husband and dad. Talk to her about where that comment came from.", "Think your wife didn't mean it how it came out, or hopefully she worded it wrong. Your wife does know of the role you played to your sister. Which is absolutely great. You stepped up when it was needed. What she may be wanting is for your sister to just be an aunt to her niece/nephew though. You are right for the role you had filled for your sister. Your wife is right for wanting your sister to just be an aunt (not a big sister) to the baby. She isn't wrong for wanting the baby to know your sister as an aunt. \n\nYour sister can look to you as she has for years. She can also accept that she is just the awesome aunt and not have to be considered \"the big sis\". This may not be a case of jealousy but instead she could be trying to get you and your sister to start looking at things like it being a normal family unit now.", "If she's apologized, you should ask yourself what you need to move on from this. Maybe grant her some grace for being pregnant and having a lot of hormones pulling her in different directions?\n\nESH if you refuse to try to move past and don't know what you want her to do to earn forgiveness. You're allowed to feel hurt, but at some point you can't be mad forever. \n\nIf you don't think her apology was genuine, that's another thing. Has she apologized to your sister?

Like you are trying to come up with stuff to leave her. For someone who supposedly stepped up for your sis you are sure willing to throw the rest of your family away very easily. \n\nYour comments and your wildly overblown reaction to your wife who apologized makes me think you actively put your sister over your wife and child. She\u2019s probably very worried you are going to favor your sister over your child. \n\nAnd based on you wanting to leave your PREGNANT wife over this comment, she is very right to be worried. She should leave you if you care so little for her. Poor wife and baby", "NTA\n\nPeople in the comments are saying alot about how your wife and baby should come before your sister now and I would normally agree. However this isn't a normal sibling relationship you raised her so in all but name she is your child, you took on the parent role and all the work and feelings tied to it. Your wife disrespected that relationship and made it less than it is, which was really wrong of her.\n\nHowever, you do say she's apologised multiple times, pregnancy can do funny things to your emotions and I think her comment came from a place of insecurity. If her apology is genuine and she's spoken to your sister to apologise, you should try and talk to her explain why you were so upset and make sure she knows it can't happen again so you can move past it.", "I think it\u2019s funny you call her your little sister in the title but seem offended that your wife clarified that she\u2019s your sister, not your child. Which is correct. If you can\u2019t forgive her for saying this, then definitely move on. A strong marriage takes good communication and assuming good intent, neither of which you are willing to have here. \n\nI would strongly recommend some therapy as you become a dad to understand how messed up the parentification you experienced is. It sounds like you still have anger towards your own dad to address.", "YTA.  Your sister is 19, not 7. She's an adult. One comment and you're ready to toss your pregnant wife? I hope she leaves.  Then there will be a kid w/o a parent.  Your wife and child come first- your father is apparently a lousy role model for this, so here's hoping strangers can enlighten you.", "NTA that is some really jealous talk coming from your wife. This may require some couples counseling. Better to do it before the baby arrives.", "This sounds like a short version of other popular stories of men acting like fathers to female relatives and making their wives jealous.", "ESH, your wife should not have said that, or at least explained what she meant better (also to your sister) and you are being a total drama queen about it. Your wife has apologized, she explained herself and she obviously worries that you will not prioritize your first born. So, instead of being a baby, you should talk to her, reassure her and ask her where her fear is coming from.", "op, I understand that you deeply value and care for your sister, but this is your wife and child she is carrying. you both are going to be new parents and need to communicate like adults. this absolutely is salvageable if you HAVE A GROWN UP CONVERSATION. esh", "ESH yeah she was out of line but you are being dramatic.", "YTA. Super-massive AH.\nYou obviously don\u2019t like your wife very much, and hopefully she realises that having to beg your forgiveness over and over again for stating a fact is messed up, and leaves before you start controlling and censoring her in more alarming ways.", "I feel bad for your wife and am so thankful I married someone without this type of baggage. I would have seriously thought I was in a prank show if this happened to me in real life. Your sister is 19 and needs to feel secure in being an adult. She does have a father and it is not you. So bizarre to even have to say that. But now you are stepping into an actual father role and need to do it right. Your sister should try to connect more with her father if she is seeking that support. She needs a brother too, but you can\u2019t do that when you\u2019re playing parent to her.", "YTA. Your reaction is overkill to what kind of seems like a joke. It\u2019s kinda weird that both you and your sister are so bothered by it. Your priority should be your wife and baby, Not your adult sibling. It\u2019s great you have such a nice relationship with your sister, but wanting to leave your pregnant wife because she told you you\u2019re not your sisters father\u2026.weird dude. \nShould have married your sister I guess", "YTA. The fact that you are ready to call it quits instead of trying to work things out tells me that you likely already had one foot out the door before this happened and this is just a convenient excuse for you.", "YTA", "YTA. Your pregnant wife spoke a fact, and you are the one that got bent out of shape about it, making her apologize for trying to set the family structure straight from the get-go. Your wife probably wanted kids with you because she could see how good you are with your sister, but this is will be different, because you WILL be a parent, with a partner. You seem to want a pat on the back for your sister, when your wife is literally incubating your spawn.", "YTA i really feel like the comment your wife made was said not meant to hurt anyone i think you overreacted way to much and maybe she should think about marrying you. To hold such a grudge like that is ridicules grow up OP", "My oldest son help me with my youngest daughter, my ex was in and out of our lives her 22 years. Their difference in age is about the same. Although my ex is alive I know my daughter sees my oldest son like a father figure. I believe your wife's comments come from her insecurities and her unspoken jealousy towards your relationship with your sister and her time in her life before your relationship. Although I think it was an uncalled comment, take it as your wife's immature personality. I would've answered your sister's comment as \"yes, he's proven to be a great father figure for you\", but again I'm in my 50s. Watch out for the future dynamic between those two as I believe your wife may see your sister as a competition.", "She handled it all wrong, but she is correct that your sister is not your child.  All depends if you will accept her apology or hold a grudge and create a very rocky relationship with her and your child going forward.  There will be resentment somewhere, for sure.", "NTA for getting upset with that unnecessarily mean comment, but you said your wife has apologised and maybe she didn\u2019t fully understand your feelings about the situation so you need to move on and accept her apology otherwise resentment is just going to grow.", "I'm gonna say NTA, it really looks like her comment came outta nowhere and was absolutely unnecessary", "YTA. Seeing how you reacted to what your wife said, being married to you seems more like being married to someone with kids from a prior relationship. And I\u2019m not sure your wife fully understood the assignment before marrying you. Which might be your fault. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m off, but in this situation, your sister would be more like a sister to your unborn child. And I worry for your relationship if your wife doesn\u2019t see it that way. \n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s your job to make sure your wife understands your relationship with your sister and her standing in your family. There\u2019s obviously some misunderstanding here, and that\u2019s mostly on you (being the active acting parent of your sister). You needed to steer that discussion way before you got to this point. \n\nNow if I\u2019m wrong and you don\u2019t see your sister as a de facto daughter, you need to make sure SHE understands that before this baby is born.", "NAH, but holding a grudge makes you TA", "NTA. Before jumping to never forgiving her, find out just how big the problem actually is.\n\nTalk to your sister alone and find out if your wife has ever said, implied, or even joked about anything like this before.

If I were you I'd ask myself if you're possibly neglecting your wife and by extension your unborn child in favor of being a dad to your sister.

My sister was visiting us last week and she said \" I am so excited to be an aunt or more like a big sister \". Suddenly my wife told her \" you can only be an aunt because this is his first real child\". My sister was shocked and said she was just joking. Here I was so pissed like I have never been before and told my wife wtf is wrong with her infront of my sister. After I drive my sister home, I asked my wife why would she say that? She said that she just wanted to support me . She knew I sacrificed a lot of my younger years to raise my sister and she needs to understand that at the end of the day she is not my real daughter and priorities now will be for my first child. I was stunned and told her you can't possibly think this is the way to support me     and that she showed me a side in her I have never seen before and I don't know if we can recover from this.

But if I were you, she\u2019d need to show real remorse for me to get over it. She\u2019s shown you that her thinking about your sister has been. I hope she can learn to think and feel differently so that you all can heal from this", "I guess adoptive parents stop being parents when the child turns 19 or they have a biological child.", "Plus some people have a high tolerance. I'm kind of leaning towards the second", "What do you think would happen if he can\u2019t recover from the comment?  I understand his shock from the comment but it\u2019s not the end of the world.  I guess his wife assume his child would be a bigger priority - his sister is 19 not 5.", "Yes the comment makes her an asshole and if she made snide comments like that before, pretty sure OP would have mentioned it;  seems very protective about his sister.  He\u2019s the bigger asshole if he throw away his family over this comment.  Maybe this is his way of getting out of the relationship with his wife.", "Wrong", "Why? I will prioritise my sister over everyone in this world and I didn\u2018t even raise her.", "ur sped downvote me idgaf", "How exactly had he not been?  Supporting his wife's pregnancy does not equate to cutting off all family ties, nor supporting her cruelty to his sister.", "lol he wants to prove her right that he doesn\u2019t care about his baby\u2014Sorry he doesn\u2019t care about his infant child, he definitely cares about his forever baby in the form of a 19 year old.", "Hopefully op\u2019s wife finds this post and proves it\u2019s the hubby so she can take her baby and run. I have a feeling his sister will always be his first priority", "She was sorry that what she said offended me this much.", "This is a terrible attitude. People don\u2019t have to have a ranking in you life like a definitive 1st, 2nd, or third place. A second child should be just as loved and valued as a first and whether or not the wife likes it, his sister is always going to be one of his children. While she won\u2019t need as much energy spent on her as a baby, her place in his life can still be as cherished and important. I have a 22 year old, 5, and a 2 year old. They are all adored and I\u2019d sacrifice everything for any one of them. I don\u2019t have to work as hard for the 22 year old. They are an adult and can take care of themselves. But that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t rate as important as the younger ones.", "It isn't a zero sum game. Wife it acting like it is and is being cruel for no discernable reason. \n\nSister's comment was basically a complement on OP being a stand-up guy and how much she is going to love this baby - wife starts peeing on husband and  flashing fangs at the sister like a wolf in a territory dispute and you think \"the sister brough it up\" is the answer?\n\nThere is absolutely no indication in any of the comments that OP wouldn't put the baby first. \n\nHis wife is acting like an evil stepparent who is jealous of the kids from the 1st marriage, and it is not OK. Usually the advice in those situations is, the kids come first and that is exactly how OP feels. His wife was needless cruel to someone he raised as his own. OP is having the reaction a normal parent would have.", "His wife wasn't blindsided by this relationship. She's been with him for years. She has been happy thus far. Now all of a sudden it's an issue. Why is that?", "So he should abandon his pregnant wife and child because she stated the obvious. His sister is the aunt not the older sister. His wife is sitting boundaries she is comfortable with. Why is it so wrong if she doesn\u2019t want to view the aunt as the baby\u2019s older sister.", "I completely agree, she sounds like the evil step mom. Pretending to like her man's daughter until she has one of her own and then turns straight up evil. I can't believe all the people defending this woman. \ud83e\udd26", "Well, lucky you then, just because your pregnancy didn't massively mess with your brain doesn't mean the rest of us were lucky like that. I have been pregnant 6 times, 5 living children. It screwed my brain so fqng bad. Glad you were the perfect mom/wife who never screwed up. The rest of us are human with our own weaknesses.", "Well that's up to you obviously but I would not like to be married to someone who prioritised his sister over me. As I said, that doesn't mean that I can speak to his sister whatever way I want or be rude to her without him getting angry. But to me my husband and kids always take priority over parents and siblings.", "Found the jealous wife.", "Have you ever left your wife (last minute situations) and put your sister above her needs?\n\nIs it possible she fears you will put your sister before the child you both created?", "Ah...a non apology. Apologizing for your feelings.", "But the older one is only the dad's child, not his wife's.  You can see issues like this with stepfamilies too.  I wonder if the wife really understood this before she got married.", "I can see the wife feeling like she is the odd man out.  This is not a kid, the younger sister is an adult now.  OP is not the parent.  I think she should leave the marriage, she will always come behind the sister.", "Maybe the sister is getting to push about the baby with comments about older sister. Or how she can\u2019t wait to do this or that with the baby. And maybe op is just happy with letting her be pushy about the baby. I can see this as the same as a overbearing mil being to pushy about a new baby.\n\n\nAlso pregnancy hormones simple things hit differently. The wife could have been ok with op and his sisters relationship but after being pregnant things hit her differently.\n\nOr the wife could have not realized the sister would take priority over their baby and from his comments it looks like op is ready to walk away because the sister got her feelings hurt. \n\nEither way. I feel there is way more to this then op is saying.", "What? Where are you getting that? I\u2019m just hoping his wife willing to work on her attitude, and no, she didn\u2019t point out the obviously. The obvious is Op also raised his sister and she will always be more than just a sister. But its obvious that a man who raised his sister since 16 wouldn\u2019t just abandoned their kid", "She doesn't have to view it as a sibling relationship, but she might should have put on her big girl panties and had an adult conversation with her husband instead of bullying his sister. Sister was an easy target for his wife.", "Many people don\u2018t even stay with their spouses.. siblings stay. Also, I grew up with my sister. That\u2018s a totally different relationship than with my wife.\n\nI would always prioritise kids if I had any though.", "Sound selfish to me", "It\u2019s not even his child it\u2019s his sister. My mother was working constantly. I took care of my sister and my brother do I called them my children no do I put them before my child also no because my child I went through 20 hours a fucking labor pushing out a fucking head out of my huha and you think I\u2019m gonna put my child over my sister. I love my sister dearly, but she knows and I know because we\u2019re adults but she\u2019s not my child", "And we know how much AITA loves evil stepmothers and fathers who drop their first kids. The only difference is she's essentially an adopted child.", "I have very little sympathy for wife. She went into this marriage knowing about his parentification and was happy with it until now and is bullying his sister instead of talking to her husband. Or... She went into this marriage thinking she could change him and that's a toxic mindset. Also, pregnancy does not give anyone an excuse to be an ass.", "Op said that his relationship with his wife was damaged and he didn\u2019t see anyway around that. So yes he very much sounds like a guy that would abandon his child. \n\nAnd his sister sounds like she is trying to force a relationship with the baby that ops wife isn\u2019t comfortable with. \n\nAnd no she shouldn\u2019t put her big girl panties on and just deal with it when it comes to her baby. If she doesn\u2019t want the sister to pretend or act like the bus sister it\u2019s her baby too."]}
