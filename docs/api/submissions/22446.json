This is the best petty revenge story!", "LOL, NTA.\n\nYour sister literally got the piece she wanted...now she wants different ones because of dollar signs? \n\nNot your fault she was blinded by the bling and is now angry at missing out on cash.", "NTA - also your mom was *with* you during the time you split the jewelry and never voiced objection to who got what. Clearly she knew you would treasure and appreciate the finer pieces, no matter their size. \n\nYour sister sounds incredibly immature and selfish, I wouldn\u2019t feel bad in the least", "Nta at all your sister was in it for herself from the start and i bet she wouldn\u2019t be keen to share if she had the more valuable", "NTA. Ask her why she never offered to resplit her picks back when she thought they were worth more than yours. She deserves what she got.", "NTA. From what it sounds like, your sister was trying to get one over on you by picking what she perceived as the most valuable pieces. The fact that you were able to do so more accurately just means you were better at doing what she was trying to do. Do not re-split.", "NTA.

You do not owe her 'take backs.' Tell that to your brother and anyone else. She chose the pieces she wanted.", "Nta.", "NTA, she got what she wanted initially.\n\nShe's basically admitting that she only wants to choose pieces of your mother's jewelry based on how expensive they are. \n\nYou chose pieces that you will actually wear and appreciate, her wanting the highest value makes me worried she'll sell them or something. \n\nWhen my mother passed one of my sisters, who had talked bad about our mother her whole life, wanted a piece of our mom's jewelry for her wedding. So I picked a piece of jewelry she never really even wore. You get what you deserve. \n\nYou are more deserving of those pieces because you know how precious they are and they connect you and your mother through something you both care about. I wouldn't give that up for anything.", "NTA-Your sister looked down on you and your knowledge. Why should you have used it to make her more aware of what she was choosing?", "You've done absolutely nothing wrong here.

Not that is his job description or something like that.  \n\nNTA \nNobody stopped your sister from getting an outside expert opinion before choosing.", "NTA, caveat emptor.  Your sister wanted the costume jewelry, she got the costume jewelry.  The world is full of situations where there is asymmetrical information.  That doesn't make you an AH.", "Meh, NTA - sister could have said - hey you know about this stuff... should we split on what their worth? Or even to get them all appraised. She didn't. \n\nYeah you knew better but what if one of those costume pieces had extreme sentimental value to your sister? Who cares about the money when it comes to sentimental.  \n\nIt may have been shrewd and underhanded..\n But your sister dug her own grave. If she wanted to reconcile and talk it over.. maybe. But you let her have what she wanted.   \n\nSorry your sibling relationship sucks", "NTA\n\nIf she respected said knowledge as a jeweller, she\u2019d have asked your opinion on the pieces.\n\nAlso, your mother was *right there* and didn\u2019t say anything.

She got to pick exactly what she wanted, and so did you.", "NTA.", "Definitely NTA she chose what she wanted you didn't say she had to pick what she did and now she wants to swap because she wants what's worth more money, she should be greatful for having something to remind her of your mother not the price, also having a melt down at a family event shows how entitled she is I'd continue to be low contact and tell her excatly the above if she starts to reach out.", "NTA", "If your brother says you are an AH maybe he can offer up his own jewelry to make his sister happy.  \n\nNTA.  The entitlement of your sister and brother is astounding.", "YTA\n\nYou know, I think it would have been fine if you just alternated choices and quietly let her make the bad choices while snapping up the good stuff \n\nBut actively \u2018fighting\u2019 her for the cheap stuff is where it crosses the line for me. You are a jeweler. When you fight her for the large pieces, you are very much confirming her view that these are the most valuable pieces. Which you know, because that\u2019s the whole reason you did it \n\nBut they aren\u2019t valuable, you were just pretending so that you could get an even better haul. I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s not using your extra, professional knowledge to scam your sister. \n\nPeople can say \u2018oh she could have brought in her own private expert\u2019\u2014 ok sure, or she could have just assumed that her own sister wouldn\u2019t be looking to pull the wool over her eyes so she could claim all the best pieces for herself? Not getting along isn\u2019t an excuse to pull a fast one.", "YTA - you intentionally deceived your sister to get the best items from your dead mother.
