One had more knowledge than the other. \n\nI dunno \u2013 OP \"won\" I guess. \n\nBut is that something that's going to make anyone happy when they're lying on their own deathbed?", "I would say this is a case of you're the justified AH.\n\nIf you acted like you really wanted the blingy jewellery, you were actively deceiving your sister (rather than just keeping quiet), which has got to be an AH move.\n\nBut it sounds like she more than deserved it, so, I'll officially vote NTA.", "You and your mom are the biggest YTA. She was present while you are splitting right? and she didnt get involved or nothing? seems like done on purpose and you are fully aware of it.", "ESH. You didn\u2019t just \u201cnot share knowledge,\u201d you actively lied and obfuscated about which pieces were valuable. Your sister is a greedy AH (for treating you badly before and for trying to monopolize the pieces she thought were valuable), but you literally did the same thing in this specific conflict: you deliberately tricked her so you could keep all the most valuable pieces to yourself, explicitly because they were valuable. So you\u2019re greedy, too.", "YTA, but the people here seem oblivious to your carefully crafted story.  You're doing the same thing to them that you did to your Sister.  You're a liar and liars are assholes.", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain and say YTA. Personally I don\u2019t get along with some of my siblings, but when it comes to inheritance I would never lie to them, despite their behaviour. Different moral compass for me.", "YTA. You basically swindled your family. Put all the pieces back together and split them evenly. Your brother should even get a share. Seems like a weird ass way of doing things.", "You didn\u2019t use your knowledge. You just let her have her choices. How were you to know she wanted valuable pieces, maybe those large pieces meant something to her which is really what\u2019s most important *isnt it*? \n\nNTA", "YTA but I would have done the same thing", "ESH - while it might be perceived as cool in aita to be petty af, that\u2019s still AH territory. You pretty much scammed the hell out of your sister in splitting the inheritance so grossly wrong, fucking knowingly. Yes i know ppl here comment you on it, but fyi the average aita contributor is like 12-14years old\u2026.", "YTA. You actively deceived your sister during an estate split. \n\nYou didn\u2019t just \u201cpick\u201d what was the most valuable. You made your sister believe she was getting good or at least equal value to what you were getting. \n\nAlso, in these posts, I never buy the old histrionic bullshit. I have no way of confirming whether or not your sister was a bully. All I\u2019m left with is the fact that during an estate split, you decided the other party because you saw dollar signs and had industry knowledge. \n\nThat isn\u2019t morally acceptable when you\u2019re dealing with join family assets. \n\nWant to know a surefire way to create resentment and blow up your family? When a family member dies, deceive your sibling into believing you\u2019re splitting their assets and instead take ownership of everything of value.", "She also sounds like she wants them so she can sell them, while OP wants them because she likes wearing them to remember her mother by. She even already had a nice moment reminiscing with her aunt over them. Sister is being very grabby and superficial.", "Not only that, but the mother didn't say anything either. It seems she knew how this would work out. Big sister got what she wanted.", "I'm glad that LOL, NO is already the top comment\n\n\nEnough said", "Costume jewelry isn't necessarily without value--just, broadly speaking, it doesn't have as much.  For example, vintage pieces from well known designers can actually fetch quite a bit.", "The whole post is dripping with contempt for her sister.  I don\u2019t believe anything that was written here, and she even states that she manipulated her sister, as you are pointing out.", "Are you saying OP should\u2019ve taken the high road and used the knowledge that Ashley shitted on for years to make sure Ashley got equal value? Mom was right there while all this went down - is it possible she knew this would happen, and wanted the daughter that she knew would actually appreciate the jewelry get the best pieces?", "Completely agree with you.", "well the mother was there when it was split, why didn\u2019t she say anything when the sister was basically throwing a fit for the bigger piece of jewelry?", "Ehh that feels slimy and manipulative. OP said they \u201clet her fight\u201d for the other pieces knowing she didn\u2019t want them", "The mother wasn\u2019t dead, the mother was very much alive and present as the jewellery was being divided. The mother was could have intervened if she felt the division of the jewellery was unfair. Clearly the mother was in favour of the way the jewellery was divided. No jewellery was taken from op\u2019s dead mother.", "*Not only does she want different ones for $$$, but she\u2019s calling OP an asshole for not sharing the expertise she mocked throughout OP\u2019s life.\n\nImagine mocking someone for becoming a jeweler, but also expecting them to give you free appraisals.*\n\n\nTHIS this is a great answer", "Imagine basically swindling your family when one of your parents passes. It's sick.", "It's a difference in approaches that could change this from NTA to ESH. Essentially the difference between actively lying and passively keeping your mouth shut. OP had no obligation to help Ashley get the best value, but OP should also not actively mislead her.\n\nIf OP simply let Ashley pick the pieces without saying a word? Fine, good, she picked them and that's that. NTA.\n\nIf OP pretended that some pieces had more value than they actually did and feigned interest so that Ashley would pick them? That's using her expertise to mislead her entirely. I'd argue maybe a light ESH in this case (ESH being mitigated by Ashley being a big time asshole and by Mom being present).", ">\u201cYou\u2019re TA because you didn\u2019t use your coloring skills for me when I fought you for something\u201d\n\nEven worse, \"I thought this was a math problem so I thought I was taking advantage of you, but it turns out it was a coloring problem and you didn't tell me.\"", "This is exactly what I came to say! She only cares because of the value and would totally sell their mothers' precious parting gifts.  I love karma!", "Stop with this \u201cdead mum\u201d garbage. Did you even read op\u2019s post? THE MOTHER WAS NOT DEAD WHEN THE JEWELLERY WAS DIVIDED UP BETWEEN THE SISTERS. THE MOTHER WAS ALIVE WHEN THE JEWELLERY WAS DIVIDED UP BETWEEN THE SISTERS. THE MOTHER WAS ALIVE AND PRESENT WHEN THE JEWELLERY WAS DIVIDED UP BETWEEN THE SISTERS. Got it now?", "I am dubious of that. You don\u2019t need to be a luxury jeweler to spot customs jewelry from a mile away. I doubt mom would think her \u201ceducated\u201d daughter could be so dense as to not know what nice jewelry looks like. Or at a bare minimum to not know what costume jewelry looks like!", "That she wasn't a very nice person?", "Or that she knew her other daughter would sell the pieces if she had the chance and OP would treasure them beyond their monetary value.", "And heirloom jewelry is typically not sellable for what it\u2019s \u201cworth\u201d unless it\u2019s an actual antique. \n\nMy grandmother died and left lots of fine jewelry behind. My mother tried to sell some of the non-sentimental items to add to the estate since no one would wear them. No one WANTS them. They are lovely pieces that are \u201cworth\u201d thousands and would only be sold for a hundred.", "Lmao right? OP is the AH but mainly because they completely fucking stacked the story telling against her sister to make sure she was told she is NTA. Such biased storytelling so full of justification at every point", "You do realise the greedy sister immediately tried to take what she thought was the most valuable right? It\u2019s even stated that she tries to always win how does someone like that suddenly want a equal split?

Is tried to chose money and failed that\u2019s on her only a doormat or a greedy asshole would defend such behaviour", "Jumping up here to point out that the mother was there.  She\u2019s the one that took OP and her sister to the safety deposit box. \n\n\nThe mom was obviously ok with the split. OP tell your relatives that. Your mom had the final say. \n\n\nNo matter your expertise your mom obviously knew the value of her own pieces and she herself didn\u2019t educate your sister either.", "Also, let's not forget, Mom was THERE. And Mom didn't speak up. In my mind, that means that it's even more NTA, because it had Mom's approval as to how things were divided between the two daughters!", "I wanna also point out you don't even have to be a jeweler to have at least a decent idea of what jewelry is costume and what is real. I can usually make an educated guess about a piece and I'm definitely not a jeweler I just picked up things from YouTube and looking at my great grandma's jewelry which had a lot of costume jewelry in it.", "Also, she was fine with getting the more valuable pieces in her first deal. Now that that's no longer true, she wants to \"make it fair\" or get more valuable pieces again. \n\nNTA.", "NTA and also even if your sister tried to sell the \u201chigh end\u201d jewelry for money she wouldn\u2019t get nearly as much as your mom paid for hit, because jewelry tends to have a pretty low resale value.", "Lol only the demented people on this sub will actually tell you \u2018oh your sister said something mean about you in high school? Yeah, go ahead and scam her when your dying mother asks you to split up her cherished possessions! That will show her\u2019\n\nIRL people will think OP is fucking awful\u2014 notice that the people who actually know both OP and her sister already do, and her concern about the things they are saying about her is why she made this post \n\nNo amount of approval from the people in this insane little bubble is going to change that", "So what was the sister's point of challenging the bigger pieces because she knew that if her sister thought she wanted them that they were worth something.  Why would the jewler show interest in fake jewelry? She ran a game on her sister and admitted it.  I'm not saying she ain't greedy I think they both are.  \ud83e\udd14 go watch the 1992 white men can't jump movie she just Billy Hoyle'd him lol", "Sorry sis I didn\u2019t realise how valuable these necklaces were I only know how to colour not do math", "Got dammit Loch Ness Monstah", "The jewelry op has is only worth money if they are sold. I feel like op will hold on to the jewelry and value them and sister would likely sell them for money.", "Yes, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a ridiculous suggestion that a dying woman who has called her daughters together to split up the contents of her safe deposit box might not have been feeling well enough to enter the bank herself, or been actively paying attention to the split. \n\nYou guys are just assuming that the mother gave her blessing because it makes OP look like less of an AH, but you absolutely don\u2019t know that it happened. OP would have surely mentioned it if she did \n\nThe sister regrets the share she got of her mothers jewelery now that she knows OP swindled her. Twist it however you like, it\u2019s never ok to scam your sibling out of their soon to be dead mother\u2019s belongings. That\u2019s just so low. OP made sure to grab all of the most expensive pieces for herself, she is just as greedy as her sister, she\u2019s just more clever and duplicitous \n\nThat OP\u2019s justification includes things her sister said in high school is just pathetic, and I can\u2019t believe everyone here is giving her a pass for it. OP is now a fully grown adult in her career, why is she still holding on to petty high school insults and slights and using them as an excuse to pull a scam?"]}
