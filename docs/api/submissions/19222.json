Names are changed for privacy. I'm meeting my partner's mom for the first time tonight. She lives kind of far away, and combined with work schedules and the fact that my S.O \"Blake\" rarely gets along with her, we haven't met.\n\nTheir relationship got stable enough to a point where she was coming around, and tonight we were supposed to meet up at a restaurant, just the three of us. But then she drops the bomb that she's going to bring not only her boyfriend, but a 1-year-old baby as well. \n\nHere's the thing. I *hate* babies, and working in a restaurant where I see them almost daily, the last thing I want to see is that, plus it would be really difficult to talk to Blake's mom if she's absorbed in caring for a child. Which, by the way, is not even hers, she's just babysitting as the kid's bio dad is a POS and won't take the kid for their bio mom and apparently cannot find anyone else to babysit.\n\nI decided that I don't want to deal with that drama, and I don't want to be around a baby for a whole evening. So I told Blake that we can reschedule if he wants, but I'm not going if the baby is because I feel like it wouldn't be a great first meeting. Blake did side with me on this, but I'm wondering if I'm being an AH by not meeting his mother just because of a child.\n\nAITA?\n\nEveryone calling me an AH just because I said I hate babies: that's not why I'm asking if I'm in the wrong. Why I don't like them: I personally find babies obnoxious, and definitely at restaurants I find them especially annoying. This is about wanting to meet my partner's mom, not be stuck at a dinner table while she coos over an infant.", "created_utc": 1686156078, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143i6n8/aita_for_saying_im_not_going_to_dinner_if_a_baby/", "score": 1879, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re allowed not to like kids but man you should really readjust your expectations of being around them because they do exist and you\u2019re going to need to learn to be more tolerant sooner or later.", "YTA. Great first impression to give his mother of you - totally uncompromising and inflexible.", "YTA it\u2019s a baby and you\u2019re an adult. Grow the fuck up. You work at a restaurant you didn\u2019t serve in baby Vietnam", "YTA:  Your bf and his mom have a strained relationship, live far from each other and have conflicting work schedules. There's finally a time you can meet her and be there for your bf in case things goes wrong and you back out last minute because a baby will be there. \n\n\nIf this was solely about you meeting her I'll agree with you. But the fact your bf and her just got to a point where they're going to interact, I think you should be thinking about what this could do their relationship.", "The mother should have rescheduled the minute she agreed to babysit someones kid. NTA", "YTA. I\u2019m not a baby or kid person either but this isn\u2019t dinner isn\u2019t about you, it\u2019s about your SO. You can suck it up for one night if you SO wants to go to dinner to reconnect with their mom.", "NTA I think all the people saying you need to learn how to be around babies missed that you already do this, in your job. As a teacher, with no kids of my own, I tend to prefer not to be around kids when I'm not working too. It changes the dynamic and this was supposed to be about your bf, you and his mum. If the baby was hers that might be different...but I totally get where you are coming from.", "NTA- it's ok to not enjoy being around children. Not everyone is child-centric as a lot of people want to shame you into believing. \n\nAll of it seems a little bit strange to me. This is your partner's mother and you have never met them. Presumably she is older and should have more life experience. If you are meeting someone for the first time and the meeting is an introduction to try to get to know them, why would you bring other people/children? \n\nIf she was tied down to caring for her grandchild, it's understandable but she should have let her son (your partner) know. In a 5 minute phone call she could have said \"hey, I have to babysit ____ and I know we had dinner plans at blah blah fancy restaurant for me to get to know ____. I realize this might not be the best scenario to chat and get to know each other. Can we reschedule?\" \n\nAlso why not tell you/him that she was bringing the boyfriend? \n\nAll of it seems down to bad communication between the mother and son.", "NTA and I agree, I think it\u2019s better to reschedule than try to meet your bf\u2019s mom while she\u2019s babysitting.", "*Hating* babies is such a weird personality trait.

Meeting the mom is more important than the fact someone can't get out of babysitting. \n\nThrowing a tantrum over a child's temporary presence in a public location and refusing to meet his family over it makes you a bigger child than the baby itself.", "NTA.

You must be so difficult to get along with.", "Yta", "Yea you're definitely TA. Hating babies aside, (what are you a Disney villain?) You are making a terrible first impression of your BFs mother.

It kind of gives spoiled, entitled, drama queen vibes.", "YTA it's just a meal at a restaurant, you can grit your teeth and bear it.", "YTA Isn't this more about doing something for your partner? Is your loathing for babies so profound that you can't tolerate talking to someone who is holding or feeding one? \n\nThis is just a chance to meet your partner's mom. Can't you put your own uncomfortableness to the side for a couple of hours for your partner? I assume he sided with you because he loves you and wants to support you and if you didn't make a fuss he probably would be fine going. \n\nI don't have a problem with you disliking babies (hate is a bit strong), I just feel bad for you. I can only imagine the amount of self-loathing your must have had in your first years.", "YTA the idea that you can just excise all babies from existence because you don't like being around them is insane.  This isn't even about you, it is about your partner reconnecting with their mom.  You are TA for making it about you, you are TA for expecting your partner to not want your support in reconnecting with their mom, and frankly you are TA for hating babies soo much that you can't just suck it up like an adult and be around one for an hour.\n\nI could never be in a relationship with someone as insensitive and inflexible as you are.  You are lucky that I am not your partner because something like this would make me seriously consider breaking up with you.", "YTA. Your SO is trying to improve his relationship with his mother and he's putting a lot of trust in you to include you on that. You can put up with being in the presence of an infant for a fucking hour for his sake. You're not being asked to care for it.\n\nBabies have absolutely no control over how they act. What's your excuse?", "YTA\n\nYou already know this and other people have stated it far more eloquently than I can.

That's not what the question is, though. The question is whether you're an AH for not wanting to meet your boyfriend's mother after she, effectively, changed the meeting arrangement. To which I say, NTA. You agreed to one situation. She has changed the situation in a fashion you find uncomfortable. It's your right to decide that the change is incompatible with your comfort level and that you'd rather reschedule. But seriously, never say you hate babies unless you want that to be the only thing anyone reads or hears.", "NTA \n\nWhy anyone take a child to \u2018meeting the partner\u2019 dinner?!?!

People who have babies seem to expect, in general, that everyone is either ok with babies or will suck it up. And many times people w/o babies DO because kids are unpredictable and sometimes you gotta roll with it. But sometimes, especially for a PLANNED DINNER, people with babies have to understand that suddenly adding a baby to the mix is unwanted and not acceptable. If I was meeting someone's mom for the first time, the last thing I'd want is to deal with a strange baby.\n\nBaby cries are worse than nails on a chalkboard and I value my sanity.", "NTA\n\nthe relationship between your partner and mum has been strained, it is slowly mending.  The meeting tonight was meant to be the three of you.\n\nthis has now changed to her bringing her boyfriend - ok, he is a fixture in her life so ssuppose that is ok (though a heads up would have been good)\n\nplus a baby, who if I am reading this correctly is not even related to your partner, the mum or the boyfriend.\n\nSo a very important initial meeting is now a babysitting gig.  Regardless of how you feel about babies this is a huge difference to the initial \"make up and rebuild the relationship\".", "NTA only because your partner is okay with it, and their opinion is the only one that matters in this situation.", "NTA. For all you people saying \"but babies are ok\" - it's not the baby, it's WORK. To make it easier to grasp, imagine the mom saying \"oh, and I WFH, so I'll be making several calls while we're at restaurant since I suddenly need to work today during our meeting\". She should not bring her work to a family meeting, even if it's a baby and \"babies are natural\". \n\nAlso I wonder if baby's parents are aware their babysitter is dragging their baby to a noisy crowded place for babysitting. It seems that the pandemic is all but forgotten now, but by no means have covid disappeared.", "NTA It\u2019s wildly inconsiderate for her to compromise your first meeting in this way UNLESS it\u2019s a dire situation and she is making sure it\u2019s ok with you.

So i make sure there's not a trace of my dislike because it's just not fair.\n\nI don't hate them though. I hate being around them maybe, but i don't hate *them.* part of being an adult is that your friends are gonna have kids even if you don't want to. get used to them or make friends exclusively with other childfree that make hating children their personality.

You could have dealt with it for a few hours. If conditions have to be perfect for you to interact with the world around you just do yourself a favor and just go full on hermit in the woods and disengage from society. Putting up with less than ideal circumstances is a necessary part of life.

However, YTA because this stunt might have widened the gap between your SO and their mother. Your minor annoyance does not outweigh their mending relationship with their parent. Babies and other inconveniences will always be a part of life- you can't bail on everything just because it's not to your liking. Meeting her should be a higher priority, y'all can always talk more later.
