Names are changed for privacy. I'm meeting my partner's mom for the first time tonight. She lives kind of far away, and combined with work schedules and the fact that my S.O \"Blake\" rarely gets along with her, we haven't met.\n\nTheir relationship got stable enough to a point where she was coming around, and tonight we were supposed to meet up at a restaurant, just the three of us. But then she drops the bomb that she's going to bring not only her boyfriend, but a 1-year-old baby as well. \n\nHere's the thing. I *hate* babies, and working in a restaurant where I see them almost daily, the last thing I want to see is that, plus it would be really difficult to talk to Blake's mom if she's absorbed in caring for a child. Which, by the way, is not even hers, she's just babysitting as the kid's bio dad is a POS and won't take the kid for their bio mom and apparently cannot find anyone else to babysit.\n\nI decided that I don't want to deal with that drama, and I don't want to be around a baby for a whole evening. So I told Blake that we can reschedule if he wants, but I'm not going if the baby is because I feel like it wouldn't be a great first meeting. Blake did side with me on this, but I'm wondering if I'm being an AH by not meeting his mother just because of a child.\n\nAITA?\n\nEveryone calling me an AH just because I said I hate babies: that's not why I'm asking if I'm in the wrong. Why I don't like them: I personally find babies obnoxious, and definitely at restaurants I find them especially annoying. This is about wanting to meet my partner's mom, not be stuck at a dinner table while she coos over an infant.", "created_utc": 1686156078, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143i6n8/aita_for_saying_im_not_going_to_dinner_if_a_baby/", "score": 4941, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Great first impression to give his mother of you - totally uncompromising and inflexible.", "[removed]", "YTA:  Your bf and his mom have a strained relationship, live far from each other and have conflicting work schedules. There's finally a time you can meet her and be there for your bf in case things goes wrong and you back out last minute because a baby will be there. \n\n\nIf this was solely about you meeting her I'll agree with you.

You can suck it up for one night if you SO wants to go to dinner to reconnect with their mom.", "NTA I think all the people saying you need to learn how to be around babies missed that you already do this, in your job. As a teacher, with no kids of my own, I tend to prefer not to be around kids when I'm not working too. It changes the dynamic and this was supposed to be about your bf, you and his mum. If the baby was hers that might be different...but I totally get where you are coming from.", "NTA- it's ok to not enjoy being around children. Not everyone is child-centric as a lot of people want to shame you into believing. \n\nAll of it seems a little bit strange to me. This is your partner's mother and you have never met them. Presumably she is older and should have more life experience. If you are meeting someone for the first time and the meeting is an introduction to try to get to know them, why would you bring other people/children? \n\nIf she was tied down to caring for her grandchild, it's understandable but she should have let her son (your partner) know. In a 5 minute phone call she could have said \"hey, I have to babysit ____ and I know we had dinner plans at blah blah fancy restaurant for me to get to know ____. I realize this might not be the best scenario to chat and get to know each other. Can we reschedule?\" \n\nAlso why not tell you/him that she was bringing the boyfriend? \n\nAll of it seems down to bad communication between the mother and son.", "NTA and I agree, I think it\u2019s better to reschedule than try to meet your bf\u2019s mom while she\u2019s babysitting.", "*Hating* babies is such a weird personality trait. I can understand finding them annoying, or not wanting to have one yourself, but *hating*? YTA just for that.\n\nEdit: for all those saying I haven't voted on the right thing, OP's hatred of babies is central to all this! The title literally ends with \"if a baby is there\" and the baby's presence is what is dictating their decision.", "YTA. Meeting the mom is more important than the fact someone can't get out of babysitting. \n\nThrowing a tantrum over a child's temporary presence in a public location and refusing to meet his family over it makes you a bigger child than the baby itself.", "NTA.

Is your loathing for babies so profound that you can't tolerate talking to someone who is holding or feeding one? \n\nThis is just a chance to meet your partner's mom.

I assume he sided with you because he loves you and wants to support you and if you didn't make a fuss he probably would be fine going. \n\nI don't have a problem with you disliking babies (hate is a bit strong), I just feel bad for you. I can only imagine the amount of self-loathing your must have had in your first years.", "YTA the idea that you can just excise all babies from existence because you don't like being around them is insane.  This isn't even about you, it is about your partner reconnecting with their mom.  You are TA for making it about you, you are TA for expecting your partner to not want your support in reconnecting with their mom, and frankly you are TA for hating babies soo much that you can't just suck it up like an adult and be around one for an hour.\n\nI could never be in a relationship with someone as insensitive and inflexible as you are.  You are lucky that I am not your partner because something like this would make me seriously consider breaking up with you.", "YTA. Your SO is trying to improve his relationship with his mother and he's putting a lot of trust in you to include you on that.

What's your excuse?", "YTA\n\nYou already know this and other people have stated it far more eloquently than I can.

That's not what the question is, though. The question is whether you're an AH for not wanting to meet your boyfriend's mother after she, effectively, changed the meeting arrangement. To which I say, NTA. You agreed to one situation. She has changed the situation in a fashion you find uncomfortable. It's your right to decide that the change is incompatible with your comfort level and that you'd rather reschedule. But seriously, never say you hate babies unless you want that to be the only thing anyone reads or hears.", "NTA \n\nWhy anyone take a child to \u2018meeting the partner\u2019 dinner?!?!

People who have babies seem to expect, in general, that everyone is either ok with babies or will suck it up. And many times people w/o babies DO because kids are unpredictable and sometimes you gotta roll with it. But sometimes, especially for a PLANNED DINNER, people with babies have to understand that suddenly adding a baby to the mix is unwanted and not acceptable. If I was meeting someone's mom for the first time, the last thing I'd want is to deal with a strange baby.\n\nBaby cries are worse than nails on a chalkboard and I value my sanity.", "NTA\n\nthe relationship between your partner and mum has been strained, it is slowly mending.

For all you people saying \"but babies are ok\" - it's not the baby, it's WORK. To make it easier to grasp, imagine the mom saying \"oh, and I WFH, so I'll be making several calls while we're at restaurant since I suddenly need to work today during our meeting\". She should not bring her work to a family meeting, even if it's a baby and \"babies are natural\". \n\nAlso I wonder if baby's parents are aware their babysitter is dragging their baby to a noisy crowded place for babysitting. It seems that the pandemic is all but forgotten now, but by no means have covid disappeared.", "NTA It\u2019s wildly inconsiderate for her to compromise your first meeting in this way UNLESS it\u2019s a dire situation and she is making sure it\u2019s ok with you.

So i make sure there's not a trace of my dislike because it's just not fair.\n\nI don't hate them though.

However, YTA because this stunt might have widened the gap between your SO and their mother. Your minor annoyance does not outweigh their mending relationship with their parent. Babies and other inconveniences will always be a part of life- you can't bail on everything just because it's not to your liking. Meeting her should be a higher priority, y'all can always talk more later.

I'm straight up not sure I would have made it, otherwise.", "Having an easy going #1 baby is part of the reason there wasn't a #2. I wasn't falling for that.", "Yes number one was the trick baby!!! Mine was the same lol, except somehow number two has managed to be even more happy and well behaved and she just turned one. \n\n\nPSA: be very careful using the term \"trick baby\" because people will look at you in a very odd way until you explain lmao.", "Mine were clean, mostly lol, but I could really relate to that poster who said something about how the kid would be clean and get to the car, sticky hands. Ugh. Mine were not too close in age, 4 years apart, but somedays I swear whichever was the smallest would just manage to find something to mess up my hard work getting them all smelling good and looking so cute! \n\nLOL", "Yeah... babies usually need to fuel throughout the day. It's not mealtimes only.\n\nAlso, they drool. Constantly. They snot, they drool, they spit up under around six to twelve months. They wander with snacks because babies fuel like 6-8 times a day, usually.\n\nHave you never met a baby? It's a never ending battle against sticky.", "I used to work in daycare in the baby room. Some babies are just full on snot machines. I think those are the ones with allergies when they grow up \ud83e\udd23", ">if I start screaming/crying and disturbing the other patrons, I would be asked to leave.\n\n\"Sir, you're yelling.\"  \n\"SO IS THE BABY!\"", ">they only care about the control and I guess birth rates\n\nCaring about increasing birthrates and promoting childbearing is the literal definition of natalism. You don't have to care about the babies themselves. In fact, most don't. Wanting more wage slaves, or white babies, or people to indoctrinate into your religion, or simply for women to be stuck barefoot and pregnant, doesn't make it any less natalist. It's just as natalist as going through rounds and rounds *and rounds* of IVF instead of adopting because you want to \"continue your family line\" or \"pass on your genes\" or whatever. Natalists don't need a *good or moral* reason to want babies born. In fact, most are immoral or amoral at best.", "You might be right that this is a cultural issue. \n\nFrom North America here, and its bad. There are obviously many great and attentive parents out there that manage small children at restaurants well, but there are also...the other ones. Talk to anyone who works or has worked in a restaurant and you will get so many horror stories. Unfortunately, shitty parents have made this a touchy subject for everyone else.", "There's a really strange contradiction some people hold that children dont know how to behave in public...thus they should never be in public to learn about it? Ive seen people on this site complaining about babies in OUTDOOR public places like breweries and the zoo. THE ZOO.", "I think this is a Reddit thing. I\u2019m American and I\u2019ve never heard complaints like this about babies in person (except on planes). Most people are happy to see babies or at least tolerant of them sharing space", "Never figured it out, sigh.", "But why are things sticky? \nBabies shouldn't be having lollipops", "I will be using catastrophic diaper gasket failure from now on. Shall I PayPal or venmo the royalty payments? Lol", "This got a full guffaw out of me. Lol well done", "You are correct. I have other tools to communicate my needs like talking. That doesn't make people imposing their squalling infants on me any more palatable. It also doesn't take away from my point. I never said babies can't exist or even that they aren't allowed in restaurants. I said dealing with babies in public is annoying... because it is. People with kids seem to have an attitude that everyone around them has to suck it up and pretend to like them. We don't. You are allowed to have kids and like them, and I am allowed to not like them and do what I can to avoid them. Ultimately, I don't think the issue is with the children. The issue is the parents not being respectful of those around them. If your kid is crying, take them outside to soothe them. Don't make it an everyone issue.", "Babies are sweaty sticky and stinky. Nope.", "I came here to make sure jam hands was quoted!"]}
