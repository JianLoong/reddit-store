Chemo destroyed his chances to have kids naturally. He froze his sperm prior and we used IVF three times. This was his last viable sample. \n\nSo, anyway. My STBX and I were still together when I got pregnant. When we found out it was a boy, he asked if we could keep up tradition. While my husband\u2019s name isn\u2019t one I totally love, I don\u2019t hate it and we settled on a nickname for it that I actually did like, so whatever, it\u2019s cool.\n\nThen STBX began having martial issues.

I also agreed with STBX that he could still be in the delivery room.\n\nMy STBX didn\u2019t show up to the birth (despite numerous people including his own mother trying to get in contact).

I did give the baby my STBX\u2019s last name as it\u2019s also mine and I have no plans on changing it as I built my small business around it. \n\nSTBX finally came by when my son was a week old. He blocked me on Facebook long ago so he didn\u2019t see what I had named him. When I introduced him, my STBX was surprised and asked why his name wasn\u2019t what we agreed. I explained that given all he had put me through, he forfeited all rights to picking the name. STBX was pissed and left not long after.\n\nMy SBTX\u2019s family says I was wrong to do this and I broke tradition. He\u2019ll never have another son to do this with.
