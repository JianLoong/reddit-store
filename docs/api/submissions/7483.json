Did he do anything to celebrate your birthday, besides sulking and throwing himself a little pity party?", "NTA - Unhealthy financial relationship. Sounds like you need to sit down and get Hubby on the same page. This will only get worse and cause a souring of the relationship over time", "NTA i guess? But honestly, this doesnt sound like a healthy situation.", "Nta but Financials are a common reason for divorce, you two NEED to be on the same page financially and understand eachothers goals.", "NTA.\n\nBut is the plan of your husband to have you permanently manage the finances and then get mad at you for the fact he has no money for fun treats he only decides he wants in the moment after he has spent all his money?\n\nWhat is he spending all his money on? Are these things he actually wants or just impulsive in the moment purchases, that he wouldn't buy if he waited a day to think on it?\n\nHe likely didn't even buy you a birthday present or card if he had no money left.\n\nIs he just using you as an excuse to direct his resentment at instead of getting better at finances?

This is a whole lot of information to say your husband is irresponsible with money, and blames you for his own poor spending habits. \n\nHappy birthday!", "I'm not sure I'd go so far as to say YTA, but here's my issue.  If I'm understanding correctly, you give him money to spend after you take money for bills (good on you!) and if he happens to blow it all, which it sounds like he usually does, you will then buy him stuff with your money.  You do realize that isn't helping the situation.  If he runs out of money, then it should be tough titties, that may be the only way he may get a better idea of how to manage money.  I think you are NTA necessarily for asking him to pay you back, but I can understand why he got annoyed at you for asking if you usually just buy him what he wants when he runs out of money.  Happy Birthday, btw!", "Sigh I just don't get why people are happy living like this. \nNTA he should be more responsible", "There's way too many unknown variables here to say who should be paying for what, but you need to sit down and write up a budget together. \n\nThat specifies how much of your respective pay cheques go into the collective pot, and how that is spent on your shared life, how much you both put towards shared savings, and how much you each have left for fun money. \n\nThen he gets what he gets and if he spends it on silly things then that's his problem.", "I say NTA. I was married to someone like this and it got to where I was full of resentment by the end of our marriage.
