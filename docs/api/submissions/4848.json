Then, your coworker still continues to be generous and give you baked goods on paper plates and you get snarky AGAIN because it's messier (kinda like the crumbs and goo you left in the original dish, no?) and YOU told her you didn't want baked goods anymore.

Your coworker MASSIVELY overreacted to a small mistake. Yeah, it's the right thing to do to clean stuff, but you noticed she was there and happened to drop it off without thinking to clean it first.

Where were you supposed to wash it? The bathroom sink?", "You win! Elegant solution", "Defendant moves to dismiss the charge of Returning Unwashed Tupperware by averring as follows:\n\n1. Plaintiff did not ask Defendant to wash the tupperware.\n2. The food contained in said tupperware was cookies -- a solid containing no grease, sauce, or other liquid that coats the container and makes washing a chore.\n3. Aforementioned lack of grease, sauce, or other liquid also averts the issue of making the container messy and difficult or problematic to transport home.\n4. Aforementioned messiness is the reasoning behind Etiquette Code Section 95.1(a)(ii) regarding washing loaned kitchenware. The fact that the tupperware contained cookies means there was no mess to clean up or protect the owner from pre-transport home.\n5. The first prong of the Etiquette Test established in *Dawson* is \"would a reasonable person consider the container effortless to touch and transport?\" No reasonable person would hesitate to touch, place in their bag, or place in their car a container that had been emptied of cookies, despite the lack of being fully sanitized of germs.\n6. Even if the Court were to rule against Defendant, Etiquette Code Section 100.3(b) establishes the penalty for inadvertently offending by neglecting to complete an assumed but unspoken request: \"Use your words.\" Plaintiff's delay in explaining what offense Defendant committed at the time of the alleged offense in favor of making comments, looks, and gestures of annoyance nullify Plaintiff's right to complain about any breach of etiquette. The proper course of action was for Plaintiff to tell Defendant, \"I'm sorry, I know I didn't mention it, but could you take it home and wash it first, please?\" Since Plaintiff waived her right to do so at the time of the alleged offense, she cannot claim a right to act annoyed later.\n\nIn conclusion, the Court of Etiquette lacks jurisdiction to hear a case of Returning Unwashed Tupperware when the tupperware did not meet the criteria to trigger the washing rule and where Plaintiff waived her right to complain by choosing not to state specifically what Defendant was charged with at the time off commission, and the complaint should be dismissed.\n\nRespectfully submitted.", "Agreed.

A few months ago, I told her about some new cookies I had discovered that I was nuts about and she agreed to make me some.\n\nYour coworker was kind enough to be willing to bake you a very specific cookie that you enjoyed. She willingly spent money on ingredients, then spent her own time and energy doing all the work required to make the cookies, package them up in a convenient way for both of you, and hand-deliver them to you at work to enjoy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I ate the cookies in my office over the next couple of days. When I finished the last cookie, I noticed she was still in her office and hadn\u2019t left for the evening. So I knocked, went in, complimented her and told her thank you for the cookies, handed her the Tupperware back as she asked, and left for the day.\n\nSince the only thing she requested from you in return for all of her aforementioned efforts was to return the tupperware after the cookies were gone, you did just that. The very barest of minimums, without your brain at any point getting the idea that hey, maybe it's a bit rude to accept someone's hard work - done at your request for your benefit - and then return to them dirty dishes as your form of appreciation for all they did for you. That's the first YTA bit there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The next day, she seemed kinda pissed and made a comment to me about \u201cYou could\u2019ve done the courteous thing.\u201d I didn\u2019t really get what she was on about.  \nI confronted her about her comment, and she said that it was rude not to clean or wash the Tupperware before giving it back, and that when someone lends you their dishes it\u2019s common sense to clean it before returning it. She also said that from now on, when she bakes me stuff she\u2019s only giving me it on paper plates.\n\nThis was the very next day after you handed her back dirty dishes. She didn't drag it on for weeks or months. She addressed it fairly quickly after you - again, to be clear - returned dirty dishes to her. She's absolutely correct that the courteous thing is to return the container in a clean state. Wash it out in the breakroom, even. Water, soap, a few seconds of using your hand to agitate that soapy water and wipe out all the edges and corners of the container and its lid, then a few seconds drying it out with some paper towels. That's less than 3 minutes of effort compared to the great amount of effort she put into her very generous gift to you, at your request.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She never mentioned it again, but every time she baked me stuff after that, she kept giving it to me wrapped on paper plates, which made it hard to store the stuff in my office and felt pretty passive-aggressive. Eventually, I told her enough was enough and to just stop baking me stuff if she was going to keep shaming and singling me out for ONE mistake. She seemed kinda offended but said okay and did stop baking me stuff.\n\nShe didn't continue to complain about the fact that you had returned the dishes to her in a dirty state. She said it one time. She didn't even refuse to bring you more baked goods after that. She simply didn't take the EXTRA effort - beyond all the work and cost associated with baking something for you - to use a reusable, resealable container for said baked good deliveries. Because you had already shown a fair bit of disrespect by not simply having washed out the container before returning it. You, in your infinite entitlement, were offended because she didn't give you a higher-class packaging for the things she baked and delivered to you, and indignantly told her her to just stop doing nice things for you if she wasn't going to do **an extra nice thing for you in addition to the baking. This is another YTA piece, and an even bigger one than the initial offense.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We get along okay still but we\u2019re not as close and chatty as we used to be. I wish I\u2019d done something different in the beginning, but I didn\u2019t know about the Tupperware rule! She didn\u2019t say to clean it, just to give it back which I did. I feel like she was unnecessarily passive-aggressive and aggravated the situation. She didn\u2019t need to rub it in and give me stuff only on paper plates, and now everyone else gets baked goods besides me and it kind of sucks.\n\nShe wasn't passive aggressive. The very next day, she told you that what you did had upset her. She continued - even after that - to bake you various things and hand-deliver them to you at work. You are not entitled to her labor. You are not entitled to her Tupperware. You are not entitled to literally anything from her. Especially after you had the fucking audacity to scold her for delivering homemade baked goods to you on a paper plate instead of in a tupperware container. \n\nYou are not getting baked goods because you were repeatedly an asshole. You fucked around and found out. You are to blame for all of your actions that led to this.", "ESH. She overreacted. You're ungrateful.", "NTA. I'm confused why she made OP his own tub of cookies.

This dude sucks.", "There won\u2019t be a next time because he won\u2019t need to worry about baked goods at work again while all his co workers get the yummy goodness", "Sure the initial moment of not washing it was a mistake but everything he did afterwards is what makes him YTA. In no way did the coworker do anything wrong. \n\nHe told her she could just clean the container herself so she made it easy for him by still bringing him baked goods just on a paper plate which is much more kindness then he seems to deserve. And then he got an ego and told her to not bother with baked goods. So now he gets to be craving his coworkers baked goods because he was the jerk", "That is also how I read the very well written \"legal arguement\" \n\nIn addition, I normally wash returned tupperware regardless of if it's been washed prior to returning anyways, but that is more because I have medical dietary restrictions and I don't know if the tupperware has been used for something else during the lending period and/or if it had been washed sufficiently to avoid cross contamination", "In what world is a few days somehow a prompt return? A prompt return would be OP taking them home that night, transferring to their own container, then returning it the next day. When they\u2019ve already kept the container for a few days, taking the extra 2 minutes to clean it would be the \u201ckindness.\u201d", "Same. I was going with ESH on the basis that as long as it's not actively messy, a same day return outweighs the usual courtesies. But if he had it several days, then wow, definitely an asshole move to not wash it.\n\n(That said, for a first offence, I still wouldn't have consigned him to paper plate status.)", "> I ate the cookies in my office over the **next couple of days**. *When I finished the last cookie*, I noticed she was still in her office and hadn\u2019t left for the evening. So I knocked, went in, complimented her and told her thank you for the cookies, *handed her the Tupperware back* as she asked, and left for the day. \n\nHe kept it over \u201cthe next couple of days\u201d and only returned it once he ate the last cookie.", "Yeah she\u2019s the rude one for pointing out that you lack courtesy not you for being lazy . You sound misogynistic. \n\nI\u2019m sure there are stores selling cookies in your country. Go buy from them and you won\u2019t get rude comments.", "Where do you live where it's \"very rude\" for someone to make a jokey comment about you not washing their Tupperware, but \"culturally speaking,\" you're not expected to wash dirty dishes before returning them to someone who went out of their way to make something for you?", "I wouldn't hand back a dirty container if I had taken it home; I would absolutely wash it before returning it. On the other hand if I emptied the container during the day and there's no nearby sink, then I would absolutely consider the convenience of getting the container back to its owner*immediately* to outweigh the insult of it being still dirty.\n\n(And if I've lent someone a container, then whether it looks dirty or clean, I'm still washing it when I get back home. And I'm not going to be even the slightest insulted by a couple of crumbs.)", "I understand the courtesy, but if it never left the office, I feel like it's easy to understand why it wasn't done? Is it really that big of a deal when the woman can take her tupperware home and pop it in the dishwasher? It's just cookies, I can't imagine it's that dirty with anything that could stain or make a mess.", "yeah it is common courtesy but also now we\u2019ve been through a pandemic and like if ur not gonna be courteous at least do it for hygienic reasons??? Tf", "Bingo. His ego is so fragile and shattered in pieces because she did not quietly \"just wash it herself\", but told him off."]}
