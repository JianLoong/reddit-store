Then, your coworker still continues to be generous and give you baked goods on paper plates and you get snarky AGAIN because it's messier (kinda like the crumbs and goo you left in the original dish, no?) and YOU told her you didn't want baked goods anymore.

Your coworker MASSIVELY overreacted to a small mistake. Yeah, it's the right thing to do to clean stuff, but you noticed she was there and happened to drop it off without thinking to clean it first. She could have just asked you to clean tupperware in the future, and if you had graciously apologized and in the future cleaned before returning there would not be drama.

Where were you supposed to wash it? The bathroom sink?", "You win! Elegant solution", "Defendant moves to dismiss the charge of Returning Unwashed Tupperware by averring as follows:\n\n1. Plaintiff did not ask Defendant to wash the tupperware.\n2. The food contained in said tupperware was cookies -- a solid containing no grease, sauce, or other liquid that coats the container and makes washing a chore.\n3. Aforementioned lack of grease, sauce, or other liquid also averts the issue of making the container messy and difficult or problematic to transport home.\n4. Aforementioned messiness is the reasoning behind Etiquette Code Section 95.1(a)(ii) regarding washing loaned kitchenware. The fact that the tupperware contained cookies means there was no mess to clean up or protect the owner from pre-transport home.\n5. The first prong of the Etiquette Test established in *Dawson* is \"would a reasonable person consider the container effortless to touch and transport?\" No reasonable person would hesitate to touch, place in their bag, or place in their car a container that had been emptied of cookies, despite the lack of being fully sanitized of germs.\n6. Even if the Court were to rule against Defendant, Etiquette Code Section 100.3(b) establishes the penalty for inadvertently offending by neglecting to complete an assumed but unspoken request: \"Use your words.\" Plaintiff's delay in explaining what offense Defendant committed at the time of the alleged offense in favor of making comments, looks, and gestures of annoyance nullify Plaintiff's right to complain about any breach of etiquette. The proper course of action was for Plaintiff to tell Defendant, \"I'm sorry, I know I didn't mention it, but could you take it home and wash it first, please?\" Since Plaintiff waived her right to do so at the time of the alleged offense, she cannot claim a right to act annoyed later.\n\nIn conclusion, the Court of Etiquette lacks jurisdiction to hear a case of Returning Unwashed Tupperware when the tupperware did not meet the criteria to trigger the washing rule and where Plaintiff waived her right to complain by choosing not to state specifically what Defendant was charged with at the time off commission, and the complaint should be dismissed.\n\nRespectfully submitted.", "Agreed.

In which case, the Tupperware should not only be cleaned, but also fill with a treat of equal or greater deliciousness.", "Cookies almost always have butter or some other kind of oil in them. \n\nAny food in a counter requires the container to be washed.\n\nYour format is cute and all - but it\u2019s incorrect.", "doing all this for what \ud83d\ude02 don\u2019t you realise we have been in a pandemic. Washing the tupperware is the right thing to do.", "The old etiquette rule is you return the dish with something in it as thank you.  Also you just re using Tupperware cause it looks clean.  Cannot eat at everyone's house.", "What etiquette book did you read that doesn't advise to clean something before you return it? Even as a little kid i knew this from watching my mom clean a plate or pan if the neighbors dropped off goodies. I baked a cheesecake for a coworker and not only did he clean the pan, he returned it along with a bag of pistachios as a thank you. That is common courtesy along with extra graciousness in my book.", "I\u2019ll be honest, as I was reading it before I had any idea what the issue was going to be, when OP said they ate the last cookie and then brought the coworker the container my\nMind immediately went \u201cwait, aren\u2019t you going to wash it first?\u201d \n\nI do personally think it\u2019s an ESH, because a simple but firm, one time \u201chey next time can you at least wash the container before giving it back?\u201d Would have been more appropriate given the initial circumstances.  However I don\u2019t think that the paper plate solution was in any way the big deal that OP has made it out to be, even if it was a little over the top for a first offense (if this was indeed a first offense, which I have to wonder to be honest given the unusual escalation). \n\nOP was still getting free baking, which is always generous, and should have simply been appreciated for the kind gesture that it was even if it did come on a paper plate. \n\nThough, honestly, why neither of these people have heard of a zip lock bag is the most baffling part of this whole story for me. I would have never risked lending out my Tupperware in the first place, and the plate would be awkward to transport to the office from the jump (and sidenote: way more inconvenient for the baker than it ever was for OP) tossing them in a disposable ziplock bag would have been the optimal \u201ccontainer\u201d from the beginning, and this whole thing could have been so easily avoided.", "Speaking as a lawyer, that is possibly the greatest thing I have ever read on Reddit. That you included a reasonable person test suggests that you are at minimum a law student, if not a lawyer yourself. You deserve all the upvotes and I have given you mine, in addition to my sincere admiration.", "Absolutely awesome.  Thank you. You\u2019ve made my evening!", "Totally agree. And even if somebody gives me back Tupperware washed, I'm still going to rewash it. I don't know how other people wash their dishes, and I'm not going to trust that. \n\nEdit: ESH  y'all are both petty", "Two things here.\n1) He apparently kept the Tupperware for days. Should have emptied the cookies at a container of his own, and return the Tupperware the day after, at the latest.\n2) The obvious thing to do, give it back clean. Honestly, OP seems like a mama's boy who never had to do a single chore in his life.\n\nAdditional courtesy rules dictate OP should have responded in kind to so many cookies. Maybe gifting a jar of craft marmalade, or a mug. heck, even a thank you note. Instead, OP thought a coworker giving him cookies, which he accepted and ate, was aggressive. This is a spoiled attitude, OP. YTA.", "Yeah, I actually don\u2019t think he\u2019s TA for not knowing an unspoken rule. There are a lot of people out there who genuinely do need \u201ccommon sense\u201d \u201cunspoken rules\u201d explained to them. And I get being defensive about the way the baker confronted him. Everything after that was AH behavior though.", "It is not unspoken in the sense that it is not talked about. It is not even not written down. It is just not a rule in the sense that there is an authority to inforce said rule.\n\n\nThese rules are supposed to be taught by parents. If your parents fail you, you might get lucky with friends and other relatives. If you don't, there are still written down guidlines - knigge is a pretty popular one in my country- who explains these things.", "True!!", "I also want to know.", "It's not bad to bring them in, but it sounds like she's bringing them in all the time, making items upon request, etc. If I were the manager here, I'd be worried it was a way of playing favorites, causing drama at worst and a lot of distractions at best.  When I first read the title of the post, I was assuming she was forcing baked goods on coworkers who didn't want to eat them (I had no way of knowing it would actually be about OP missing the baked goods).  But surely there's someone there who is over it?\n\nAgain, she's not an AH, OP is.", "Maybe, just a crazy idea, buy a bag of chocolate chips, try to follow the very simple recipe on the bag and bake your very nice coworker a batch of super simple chocolate chip cookies as a gesture of reconciliation. Asking your gf to bake something just makes you even more of an asshole and possibly a misogynist because are you seriously not competent to bake cookies?", "Omg get your gf to make something for you???? You have got to be kidding. Do it yourself", "> I don\u2019t really know much about domestic and kitchen stuff but I like your idea and might ask my gf to bake something for me to take to work.\n\nLmao", "That poor woman.", "Dude...", "All I'm saying is, as someone who has baked and given away tons of stuff, I can't imagine being upset that someone didn't wash a container they returned to me.

It's literally a non-issue.", "I totally get all of that, but as someone who is also hopeless when it comes to a lot of social interactions, that isn't what I would've assumed. (I'd still be washing any Tupperware I get from friends regardless and have done that in the past with dirty returned Tupperware). Just tell me what is expected and I'll do that, but she didn't do that. :/", "Not gonna lie, I would be kind of peeved if I made someone cookies and then they didn\u2019t clean the container and also gave me a snarky passive aggressive comment in return. Like aside from your later outburst I guarantee that\u2019s part of the problem.", "If it\u2019s easy for her to wash at the kitchenette, then it\u2019s easy for you. She already did you a favor baking for you. Now you want her to clean up after you too?    You seem very entitled.", "Ahh, you gotta wash it if it\u2019s gooey. \n\nA lesson for next time.", "What mean stuff did you say to this woman who hand made you cookies that you asked for?", "I mean, if not getting treats that she's spending time and money on is so serious then why don't you apologize? And make her something? She did nothing wrong - you yourself said that she joked eith you and even kept giving you treats after you were rude to her (if it doesn't cost anything to wash it, why not wash it for her??)", "You escalated it.", "That\u2019s called cutting your nose off in spite of your face.

YTA  OP because i need to put in the judgement.", "But the container doesn't need to be soaked and scrubbed. It's not like it had greasy fried chicken or a stew in it.\n\nI'd think that returning the container so promptly would've been a kindness itself... But also possibly the coworker had an issue with providing a container to someone who eats the cookies that fast.\n\nI dunno the size of the container so can't judge if OP scarfed down an unusual amount of cookies, but I'd not see the point in using a container to give someone cookies if they aren't gonna be transported home from work.", "If that were her concern, she wouldn't have loaned something reusable in the first place.", "Wow, thanks. Legal secretary.", "Yup", "Clearly some sexism in the treatment of women and couldn't be bothered to clean a container because he's a ^man. Ridiculous", "Apparently it is to his coworker though.

I wasn\u2019t trying to be passive aggressive or snarky to her but I was embarrassed knowing I messed up.

Or, like others commented, he could've brought his own container to store it in (hence me calling him entitled - \"why can't you both spend time making me a gift and cleaning said gift after while I do nothing to reciprocate!

It sort of depends what kind of lawyer you are, but overall it\u2019s a grind and the money isn\u2019t as good as most people think. If anything, become a paralegal. More money and job opportunities, but way less extra education and stress.", "Am I a good fit for that if I hate doing legal research lol?", "It probably depends on what area of law you work in and the firm you work at but I would expect that lawyers and articled students do the research.", "That's different than the impression I got.
