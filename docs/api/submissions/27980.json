We both decided this year we would keep it simple due to both of us saving money for various reasons, so we just decided to go to a local restaurant for a nice dinner. I love my in laws, we get alone great. My FIL is the chillest dude I have ever met and fun to be around. My MIL is a bit quirky but is super kind and loving once she gets comfortable around you. Yesterday morning my wife was talking with her mom on the phone and mentioned we were going out for dinner and MIL asked her where we were going. She told her we're going to a local steak house and that they could both (MIL and FIL) join us if they wanted. After my wife got off the phone I asked her, if we were still going out for our anniversary or just out for a normal dinner now? She assured me it was our anniversary dinner. So I asked why would she invite her parents? She didn't see if being a big deal but I told her I would rather it be just the two of us. She got upset and told me if I didn't want them to come with us I would have to call them and tell them that, so that's what I did. I called my MIL and told her that it was actually an anniversary dinner for me and my wife and she understood and said it was no problem, and that if she knew it was our anniversary dinner she wouldn't have accepted my wife's offer. We went to dinner and had a good time but all day today my wife was giving me the cold shoulder and said I was a jerk for uninviting them. I feel a little bad about it but I know I wouldn't wouldn't want to tag along for someone else's anniversary if the roles were reversed.

Unless it's a long standing tradition to celebrate with the ILs, wife should have run the invite by OP first.  It's a special day, money is a concern, and she majorly set up OP to look like the bad guy.  Luckily it didn't turn out that way the ILs seem to have been reasonable about it.\n\nBigger question is why did wife do this?", "NTA\n\nYou are lucky to have a lovely and understanding MIL because your wife has put you in a very bad situation.\n\nYour parents-in-law are invited by their daughter and 5 minutes later, you call to tell them they're not welcome...  \nYour wife could have created an argument and given her parents the impression that you didn't want them there. She should have called them herself and told them they were no longer invited.  \n\nIt was her mistake to invite her parents without consulting you in the first place, it was up to her to deal with the awkward call.", "NTA, it\u2019s weird that your wife would invite her parents for anniversary dinner. It\u2019s strange to me that she has this reaction when it seems like your inlaws are pretty reasonable people. Are there aspects of their relationship that you may not know about? Do they play it cool in front of you but guilt your wife behind closed doors?", "NTA. She should have run inviting anyone else by you since it was for a couple's occasion.", "NTA \n\nWho's your wife married to, you or her parents???\nDoes she invite them into your bedroom, too???", "definitely NTA, an anniversary dinner should just be the two of you. In-laws seem great though, so I'm glad there isn't any fallout there.", "NTA. Your wife made unilateral decisions on a meal you clearly should've had joint input on, obviously misled her parents about what the meal was for, then made you do the dirty work of uninviting them after she instigated this entire situation. That's not okay.", "YTA. It's just one dinner. Why can't you be accommodating? You sound petty and whiny.", "NTA Its your anniversary dinner ..if my wife invited other people, then I would not bother going.", "Instead of giving us a holiday party, they had us go volunteer at the rehab place our boss used to be in.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think it is completely reasonable to want to celebrate your anniversary with just the two of you. In any case, your wife should have asked you before inviting anyone to come along to any dinner plans the two of you made, just like you should ask her before you invite anyone. It's just polite.", "I mean  NTA but unless you two never go out and get to talk alone was it that big of a deal? You still get to home alone together to continue the celebration.  Granted I do get it or maybe you two don't get alone time at all but not every relationship is the same. Hope it was still good for you two.", "NTA\n\nAnniversary dinners are either just the two of you or it\u02bbs a party with guests. Clearly this was the former.\n\nYour wife erred in issuing the invitation. Especially without consulting you.\n\nBut good luck getting her to admit that and apologize.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA, but a dork.  She didn\u2019t think and that was a little rude but you through a hissyfit.  NTA, but a dork. \n\nI celebrated the wedding with family and friends, ok.  I can celebrate an anniversary with some people too.", "I think it's because we decided to keep it casual this year. We spend a lot of time with her parents because I genuinely enjoy spending time with them and we do eat out with them a lot. We talked it over and she thought it wouldn't be a big deal because we decided to keep it casual, without any romantic gifts or gestures. She apologized and said she made me call them because she was just upset and embarrassed", "I mean\u2026odds are that her parents would have paid for dinner. \n\nI don\u2019t think that would be her primary reason for inviting them, but maybe it was a factor lol.", "I thank my lucky stars almost everyday that I lucked out with great in laws. They both understood and said it was more then ok that they didn't come", "I celebrated my wedding with family and friends.  I wouldn\u2019t be upset if an anniversary involved the same family and friends.\n\nPreferably, however, with both families and not just part.  But why on earth would I be all whizzed off just because 2 more people are there for a \u201cspecial\u201d dinner.", "Why would the parents pay when they were the invitees? It didn't mention the parents being wealthy. They are all adults, so wouldn't the default be that either (1) the people who do the inviting pay, or (2) the bill is split?\n\n(Serious question. Unspoken social nuance and expectations are major blindspot for me.)", "Generally people pick up the check for others on their special occasions. Like you're out with your friend on their birthday you pay for dinner is not uncommon. \n\nParents are generally even more inclined to do that for their kids, even adult kids who are 40+.", "Parents are just nice like that. :)  If they know it is an anniversary (I am sure this would have been mentioned, even if they had not remembered) the parents would likely pay as a celebration. Also, parents often pick up the tab because they are more financially secure than a younger couple. \n\nBoth my parents and in-laws would always offer to pick up the tab. For a special occasion, my husband would allow them to, otherwise he might pick up the bill first and say \"Thanks, but I think it is my turn to pay\".", "> and that if she knew it was our anniversary dinner she wouldn't have accepted my wife's offer. \n\nShe didn't know it was a special occasion.\n\nEta: Thanks for the genuine response.", "I'd be willing to bet that the degree to which this is the norm is tied to economic status. Interesting.\n\nThanks for your time and patience in articulating that."]}
