Same goes the other way around.

She spends her time trying to convert you and make passive aggressive remarks to try to make you feel bad. She has a super entitled view as most Christians do. You don\u2019t owe her anything. If anything she should apologize to you for constantly pestering you then crying when you do the same to her.", "NTA - The two of them owe you an apology.  It is not even up to debate.", "NTA. No apologies need to be given. In the conversation she was stating a fact as pertains to her and her relationships, understandable. But with her gifting you bibles knowing you are atheist is unacceptable. If you gifted her books of Sigmund Freud invalidating religion, or a Satanic bible, How would she react? (I understand your Atheist, and do not believe in any religion, just using the satanic bible as it would be similar to what she is doing to you) It would be a disaster! Then to add to it, demand an apology. Be who you are, and if your friends can not handle that, then they were never friends to begin with!", "NTA, she\u2019s a hypocrite.", "NTA. \u201cAnyone who doesn\u2019t believe in the lord is a red flag\u201d. So, essentially, she doesn\u2019t respect *any* religion, except for Christianity.", "NTA. Dig in and beat her at her own game. What about the whole Jesus and forgiveness thing. They know not what they do - as he was crucified. Tell her to take a page from her Bible and be the bigger person for once.", "I think the key difference here is whether your guys were talking about a personal red flag, or a general red flag. Individually, as personal \u201cred flags\u201d, you were both correct - you would probably both have a hard time having a partner with different religious perspectives, because that\u2019s so important to each of you (in your case, being an atheist and believing that God does. It exist). So I don\u2019t think either of you were wrong to feel that or to say it in each others presence.", "NTA. She's a jerk and is pushing her beliefs on you after numerous rejections and objections. She deserves to be pushed back on now.", "If you put any other thing in place of religion, what she's doing is still distasteful asf. Friends shouldn't overstep boundaries. You have told her yours and she's not listening and still pushing her crap on you. It's not fair for her to get in a pissy fit because you gave the same energy back after she was incredibly disrespectful to you, in front of other people no less :/", "Nta \n\nAnd as a good Christian she should be forgiving you.", "I\u2019m a Christian, and I think your friend was incredibly rude to you. Fair enough throwing it back at her. NTA", "SCREW CARA! Hell no you are not!! That's my BIGGEST issue with people that are religious \ud83d\ude15 they try to shove the shit down our throats but how dare we voice our beliefs!", "\"Be the bigger person.\" is BS and only serves bullies.  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA I was raised in church and I have my own issues with organized religion that I won\u2019t get into here. Your friend was extremely disrespectful by implying that you can\u2019t deem an opposing belief a red flag, but she can. That is called hypocrisy and the bible speaks loudly, and often, against hypocrisy. The lack of a religious belief doesn\u2019t mean it cannot be disrespected. Your choice to not believe is, in and of itself, a belief system (please note belief system is different than religion). You believe there is nothing (in a sense of gods and the like).  She needs to respect that. As for the invites to church, tell her you\u2019ll go but you\u2019ll cuss the entire time and throw up \u201chell yeahs\u201d instead of amens when the pastor says things. Do this every time and she\u2019ll be really pissed but will eventually stop inviting you.", "NTA and you need better or actual friends.", "NTA\n\nRespect other person beliefs is mandatory and she failed big time.\n\nYou also were disrespectful, but was after being offended.\n\nApologize for being rude, but demand apologies because she was offensive and disrespectful.\n\nAnd there is no such thing as \"be the bigger person\". You were the offended one, not them.", "NTA!!!! \n\nLove and tolerance are important qualities in people.  OP, find some new friends who don\u2019t manipulate you and make sideways comments because they don\u2019t accept you for you.", "I think it was Stephen Fry that said\n\n> Religion is like a penis. It's ok to have one. It's ok to be proud of it. But try to shove it down my throat and I'm going to hurt you. \n\nReligion can bring people joy and sometimes it can even just make life bearable. \n\nBut you did to her exactly what she did to you. \n\nIt was uncalled-for and honestly if I was you I'd have a serious talk with her if you're even really friends. \n\nNTA", "Be the bugger person translation : be a doormat and let people walk all over you and disrespect you. Never ever \"be the bigger person\". Your friend disrespected you as a person. If she can't take it, she shouldn't dish it out. NTA!", "I\u2019d like to add, I\u2019m Christian. This is how not to bring people to God. We can\u2019t shove it down their throats because that gives the opposite. Cara is a hypocrite. It\u2019s possible to disagree with someone and their beliefs but also still be respectful. \n\n\u201cFor me, I\u2019d need someone who believes as I believe, in God\u201d but leave everyone else out of it. She was definitely singling out OP.", "Happy Cake Day!", "This.", "Lol \ud83d\ude02", "Yeah. It is always atheist fault no matter what.  Lol.", "That's unnecessary, not every person who follows a set of beliefs is an AH", "Tbf there has been some historical evidence that supports Jesus as a man being real - the rest is heavily debated", "Why can't y'all live and let live ffs?", "The bible also says to pray in your closet and not prostrate yourself in the street.", "The Evangelicals think that the only to win souls is to hit you over the head with a Bible. \ud83d\ude2c There are other ways.", ">Atheism\n\nAgain, an atheist does NOT believe that god doesn't exist.  This is important, they see NO evidence that god does exist.", "Oh my gosh! This has turned into THE most fascinating conversation! I never knew any of these things about Atheism. I\u2019m a Christian so when my son told me he was an Atheist, I was hurt, but because I love him, I accept his choices for his life. But I really didn\u2019t understand. So this has been really eye opening and clarifying \u2014 thank you!", "I mean thats what we all do. I wasnt saying to do/say anything to them. Just that you dont have to respect it", "Having grown up in the Evangelical Church, I absolutely concur. This is also why I call myself a Christ Follower rather than a Christian anymore.", "But they still shove that, their worldview, in my face rather than respecting what I see in the world", "But it isn't a belief.  It is refusing to believe when there is NO evidence.  There is a succinct difference.", "I also as an atheist disagree with your son.  IF I was presented with credible evidence of a god I would believe it.  But, I have NEVER seen any evidence remotely suggesting the presence of a god.  I am also (like Zuke-65) not offended by your statement.  Atheists 'believe' many things.  God isn't one of them.", "I\u2019m sorry. I, too, am a Christ follower \ud83d\ude0a Also I\u2019m an Episcopalian.", "That\u2019s not technically correct. \n\nYou could be a theistic agnostic where you believe in a higher power but you acknowledge that you can\u2019t say with certainty whether it exists, similarity you could be a", "Again, not really.  \"Belief\" means an acceptance that something is true or that something exists.  One doesn't actually believe that chocolate is better than vanilla, it is simply a preference.  Chocolate and Vanilla ABSOLUTELY both exist and both are truly flavors.  An atheist does NOT believe that god exists because there is no evidence to support the claim.  A religious person believes god does exist because of some trust or faith that it should."]}
