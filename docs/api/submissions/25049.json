You insulted nothing. Religion or non-religion is a totally valid deal breaker in a romantic relationship. Calling it a red flag is a bit inflammatory but essentially correct: if your friend wants someone who goes to church with them every week and has similar churchly values, why not make that her green flag and consider the opposite a personal red flag? Same goes the other way around. Some people date and marry very successfully outside their religion, but it is a potential source of strife. \n\nI'd personally consider someone going to church every week as a sort of a soft red, proceed with caution, flag in a potential romantic relationship.

Belief can mean faith/worship, like a Christian believes in God.  It can also mean opinion - \"I believe chocolate ice cream is better than vanilla ice cream.\"  It can also mean an acceptance of facts that a person can't prove themself, such as \"I believe in the Theory of Evolution because such a wide range of scientists have accepted it even though I'm not a scientist myself.\" \n\nWhen an atheist says they don't believe in deities, it generally means \"I haven't seen any evidence that would make me think any gods exist\" or \"I am sure that gods do not exist.\"  An atheist's belief that dieties don't exist is comparable to someone's lack of belief in the Tooth Fairy or the Easter Bunny.  There's no belief system involved - no prayers, rituals, holy books, etc. - just a conclusion that there are no dieties.\n\nBTW:  just because someone is an atheist, that doesn't mean they share any other beliefs with other atheists.  There are atheists that only believe in what they can perceive, atheists that belief in fairies, that believe in aliens, etc.  The only thing they necessarily have in common is that none think there are any deities."]}
