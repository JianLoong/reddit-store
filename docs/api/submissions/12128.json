While living here we bought them new phones, laptops, and clothes because they could only come with one suitcase each and their phones were all outdated and we thought they could use the laptops to find jobs, learn English, and communicate with their dad (48m) and brother (22m) back home. My wife and I just graduated college in July and we\u2019re beginning our first jobs. \n\nThere\u2019s been a pattern of my MIL getting angry with us and yelling, throwing furniture, and telling us we\u2019re selfish and don\u2019t help her at all. Keep in mind we\u2019ve given her rides everywhere she needs to be, helped find a non-profit organization to provide her $1,500/month as refugees, have helped her with finding a job, and have assisted her with anything she has ever asked. My sister-in-law was able to find a job within the first couple months of living here and has been extremely self reliant and independent. \n\nA couple days ago my brother-in-law got into his second fight at school. My first thought was to ground him from his video games and phone for the weekend and have him mow the lawn and do some chores as his punishment (I thought this was a pretty mild punishment for a second fight tbh). She yelled at me that he didn\u2019t do anything wrong and that I have no right to talk about it because we don\u2019t do anything for them and we\u2019re selfish. This was the last straw for me, as she\u2019s lived here for 10 months, made it my wife\u2019s responsibility to find her a job, and has consistently belittled my wife and told us we don\u2019t do enough for her. We originally told her she could stay until May and we would evaluate the situation to see if they needed to stay longer to get more help. I told my MIL that she can stay until June when my brother-in-law finishes the school year, but that we will no longer be offering any assistance at all, and she needs to be gone by June or I would have her evicted. I was fed up with the constant yelling, blaming, and lying to us. This made her extremely angry and she told us that we\u2019ve never done anything for her and that it\u2019s our fault she took so long to find a job and that we have never helped her with anything. l told her there\u2019s nothing more we can do as we\u2019ve tried our best to only ever help and that it was final. \n\nMy wife and I are still young and don\u2019t feel it\u2019s our responsibility to baby her, especially because my wife just started working as a nurse a few months ago, and I\u2019m in the middle of applications for med school and we\u2019re just trying to make ends meet ourselves and aren\u2019t very established in our careers at all", "created_utc": 1678638271, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pim0n/aita_for_kicking_out_ukrainian_refugees/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like she acts this way with everyone. We have also had Ukrainian relatives staying with us, and I'm pleased to say it was fine. We did think about it had clear ideas about acceptable behaviour - both from them and from us. With a bit of give & take and some adjustments on both sides we got there. This sounds like your MIL is toxic and is using both of you as a punching bag. You don't have to put up with that and you have already done everything you should have done.", "NTA, but BIL may benefit from support and counseling rather than grounding. He's been through a lot of trauma recently, and fighting is often the result. Check out www.livesinthebalance.org for some ideas (could also probably help with MIL, tbh. She sounds like an \"Explosive child\" to me...)", "I\u2019m sorry for you & your wife. This is really a no-win situation.", "NTA.  MiL sounds like a real piece of work that has exhausted the sympathy and good will her extreme situation brought on.  For the record though, I would stay out of day to day parental decisions regarding bro or sis inlaw until asked or the situation can't be ignored .", "NTA. There may be resources to help your BIL with his adjustment to living here, but shy of a shock collar for MIL, not sure what more you could do. MIL sounds grossly ungrateful and cruel, and a year is more than enough.", "\nNTA they are ungrateful (or at least MIL is) and undeserving of any more help.  You are a saint for still giving them until June I may have given them two weeks to get out at that point.", "NTA", "Oof I can\u2019t imagine how hard it would be to leave behind everything and everyone and move to a country where I didn\u2019t speak the language.  \n\nThat being said, taking it out on the very people who allowed you to escape a Russian invasion seems nonproductive. If MIL has the proper papers and resources and such to get a job, then she really does need to find something more productive to do than throwing furniture that doesn\u2019t even belong to her.  Is there any chance your wife can get her dad or oldest brother to point out how ridiculous their wife/mother\u2019s behavior is, considering the opportunity she\u2019s been given?\n\nNTA but I do not envy your position.", "NTA \n\nThis is a clear example of family issues, regardless of where they are from.  Honestly the title of your post is misleading, they're your in-laws.  Would you feel as bad if they were from Kashmir or Cameroon? \n\nEven if they were model guests, it's not unreasonable to ask them to leave after months.  Your home is your home.", "NTA\n\nYou need to get your wife to back you up on this and tell her mother that her behaviour is unacceptable after all you guys have done to help her. \n\nMaybe your MIL is just really stressed. War is a horrible thing and she\u2019s had to leave her country, husband and one son behind. I\u2019m guessing she doesn\u2019t want to be in America and is having a hard time adjusting as is her youngest son.\n\nYou guys need to sit down with all 3 of them and have a calm discussion. If she won\u2019t, then def show her the door", "NTA. The only reason I can think of to maybe cut your MIL some slack, is that many refugees carry trauma that they can't unload till years after the fact, if ever. Then on the other hand, some people are just AHs, regardless of other circumstances. It sounds to me as if you have done everything that could be expected of you, well actually well above reasonable expectations. Don't let them stay so long that it ruins your own relationship.", "I'm so sorry. I have heard a number of similar reports from people who have taken in Ukrainian refugees, both in the UK and in the US. Sadly I think that many refugees from such dreadful circumstances come preloaded with rage and terror that the average family is ill-equipped to address, especially young people like you, who are already stretched thin by career and financial demands.\n\nI did a quick search and can find little in the way of resources to help you or them with this trauma. I'm afraid that even church resources might be problematic unless you have a Ukrainian orthodox church available. So I think that setting a reasonable boundary, as you have done, is about the best option. In fact your boundary is generous,  given that she's flinging furniture.\n\nBless you for trying, and very much NTA.", "NTA your mother in law needs to see a behavioral psychiatrist. There\u2019s more going on. She\u2019s probably got some complex PTSD with the explosive anger. I\u2019d say complex being from the age group she\u2019s in and from the country she\u2019s from. I would try not to judge her too harshly but I would definitely protect your wife and maybe try to find your MIL a psychiatrist and therapist", "NTA - I know this a stressful situation for you and your wife. My heart goes out to your in-laws. You also mentioned that your FIL and BIL are still in the Ukraine. That adds an enormous level of stress to the situation. It is probably better that you not live together, but I hope your MIL and BIL get the help they need. And I hope for peace and safety for the people of the Ukraine.", "NTA but I imagine the culture is very different there and I would suspect there are some trauma related issues that aren't being addressed. It's a hard situation. Best of luck to you and your family.", "Nta,  instead of telling her to get out, I would just come into her room and take shit. When she watching tv come in and change the channel and say this is my tv. Basically do her like Russia did the Ukraine and remind her she needs to be humble. And If she didn\u2019t get the point then threaten to put her out..", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You mention she is doing well, and I'm worried she will be made to support them if she leaves too", "NTA. There a large number of Ukrainian refugees in my town also and they have none of them acted like this. They\u2019ve been focused on supporting themselves, integrating into the community and getting jobs, working out housing, etc.  Your MIL is an abusive moocher who has taken advantage of you. Rule one, don\u2019t abuse the golden goose or the eggs stop coming,", "NTA. They\u2019re just entitled and ungrateful. In my country we had these issues with Ukrainian refugees always complaining about how they were hosted and some of them even ask to get apartment on the French Riviera and how the rents were too expensive ect\u2026 they think that being white entitles them to be treated better than other war refugees . Luckily ,some  of them aren\u2019t like that and are very nice and grateful but if they aren\u2019t happy they should check how \u00ab\u00a0brown\u00a0\u00bb and black refugees get treated .", "Sounds like she is both toxic, and scared out of her mind and therefore acting out. Can arrange for some counseling. A trauma support group?

Society includes sh*tty people. Some refugees are, therefore, sh*tty people. Unfortunately that appears to include OP's MIL.", "This is actually extremely helpful\u2026 Thank you!!!!", "I would agree with this. I had taken a step back because I didn\u2019t feel it was my place to ever parent him, but she asked me to be more involved with her son, as he doesn\u2019t have a father-figure currently and I was happy to do so", "That\u2019s been my main concern. I don\u2019t want to be an asshole to her and I can\u2019t imagine what she\u2019s gone through and I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s struggling to deal with the situation or if it\u2019s just how she acts\u2026 it\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve tried my best to be patient, but I just don\u2019t know at what point enough is enough", "LOTS of people carry lots of trauma. It doesn\u2019t give us an excuse to be selfish AHs to folks trying to help us. Fact is MIL is a bully and had weaponized her trauma to excuse being a bully.", "This also occurred to me because they have understandably been through serious trauma and the dad and brother are still back there so it must be hard wondering each day if they are ok. But it's an explanation, not an excuse or get out of jail free card to treat you like crap. It might help to talk with her about getting her some help, maybe support groups. I'm sure there are lots of things set up for Ukrainian refugees to assist them. You can't make her go of course and she might be resistant to the idea, thinking you are accusing her of being crazy. It also might help to just sit down with her and explain what you've explained here. That you understand she is going through a lot, but you can't handle her constant yelling and abuse, that you are trying your best to help but you and your wife are young and just starting careers so you are limited, that you feel have done a lot to help such as A, B, & C so you like her accusing you of doing nothing and ultimately something has to change. She doesn't have to be perfect, but if nothing changes then you can't have her live with you anymore.", "There's homless shelters they csn stay at and if they are deported back there's only a small chance they are killed", "It definitely helped me! \"Collaborative and Proactive Solutions\" works great, especially with older kids and adults. \ud83d\udc95", "Well but also you need to realize you are not his father in any way, shape, or form.  Do you always inappropriately insert yourself into your wife\u2019s siblings\u2019 upbringings?

Is this how her mums always been or is it new behaviour?", "Do t worry once she's homless they will be deported back and you won't ever see them again even if they survive", "I completely agree! I hadn\u2019t been involved at all until she had asked me to be more involved with him because she wanted him to have a father figure. I don\u2019t pretend at all to know how to parent a child, as I don\u2019t have any children of my own, but am trying my best to help him however I can because I think he deserves a man in his life to look out for him\u2026 I worry that it may be another reason I could be the AH in the situation", "She hasn\u2019t lived at home for about 6 or 7 years now, so she said she doesn\u2019t really know. My SIL says this is normal behavior for her and they would just avoid her when she would get upset until she calmed down", "Yeah I think it\u2019s just a tough situation altogether but would definitely be best if they could find their own housing.\n\nBut giving him advice and mentorship is one thing - punishing him is another.  That\u2019s the only part where you are the AH, as it is just not an appropriate role for you.", "I can respect that and can see where I overstepped.
