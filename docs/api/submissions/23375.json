My girlfriend(26F) has never really got on well with my little sister, Sister has said GF gets an attitude towards her and gets snappy or irritated with her for no reason. I've called my sister by my nickname for her a ton of times around GF and she's never said anything about it before, neither has anyone else and our family finds it \"cute\". A few days ago GF came to me and asked for me to stop calling Sister by \"that weird name you call her\", I asked why and she said it made her uncomfortable, I didn't see why it would make her uncomfortable but I didn't want to her be upset so I said I'd try an stop around her, but that didn't seem to satisfy her, she wants me to stop calling my sister \"baby\" and \" babygirl\" all together, I told her I wouldn't do that as this is something I've been calling my sister since she was an infant, and she's my baby sister and she'll always stay that way. My GF is throwing a fit over a 14 year long nickname, my sister says she's being dramatic, I want to agree with my sister since I don't see how it's inappropriate or uncomfortable for my GF to watch me call my sister those nicknames but I also don't want to make my GF upset with me over something so small. My sister and GF have also had a few other issues but this is mainly about the nicknames. Sorry for the possible bad grammar as I wrote this on my phone.

Big red flag. Not a baby red flag, lol. Big red flag. NTA", "Nta.\nPick up the red flag op, your gf is threatened by your sister.  Not a good indication of things to come.", "NTA. I\u2019m someone who also calls my younger sister (aka the baby of the family) \u201cbaby\u201d/\u201cmy baby\u201d because, like you said, she\u2019s always going to be my baby sister no matter how old we get. We should normalize close sibling relationships and genuinely loving our family over being combative, distant, etc.", "NTA \n\nThat nickname may be used for significant others as well, but so is \u2018sweetheart\u2019 and \u2018honey\u2019, which are also used for children.", "NTA. Why is your girlfriend sexualizing your relationship with your sibling?", "NTA. Your girlfriend on the other hand...", "ESH. You suck because you continue to date someone who your young sister has told you treats her poorly. He's jealous of a nickname for your sister.. your baby sister. Like.. open your eyes? \n\nYour GF obviously sucks here too. Your sister is fine tho.", "NTA.  \u201cNobody puts baby in the corner.\u201d  It\u2019s super cute you call your sister a nickname, your girl friend is weird for sexualizing it.", "NTA. Your GF is envious of your relationship with your sister.  Let that sink in.", "NTA \n\nYour girlfriend is making it sexual when it is not a sexual context. Sounds like your girlfriend is jealous of the attention you give your sister.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is doing some pretty intense mental gymnastics to make this a big deal - to the point that she appears to be sexualizing a benign nickname for a younger sibling. She\u2019s showing you who she is/what she\u2019s all about - pay attention. Also, how old is your girlfriend that this isn\u2019t the first issue that she\u2019s had with your 14yr old sister, a literal child?", "NTA. Your girlfriend is jealous of and/or threatened by your sister. Your fourteen year old sister. Ick.", "NTA but you WBTA if you don't ditch the girlfriend. She's obviously applied a sexual connotation to your nickname for your *14 year old sister*, and that is WEIRD!", "NTA your girl friend is making something platonic you have with your sibling into something romantic and sexual which is not ok.", "NTA.  Even trying to avoid it around her is a compromise on something that really shouldn't matter to her.  It's not her business at all what family nicknames are used when she isn't there.  It sounds like some rather extreme insecurity unless there's something massive missing from the story.  Did you ask what changed if it didn't bother her before?", "NTA, it\u2019s a perfectly reasonable nickname that stuck and has been used way longer then your girlfriend has been in your life. Why does a grown women have so many issues with a 14 year old child though?

Your sister is fine with the nickname so no reason to stop using it.", "NTA. I've been the sister in this situation, OP. Trust me, it will not get better. Whatever problem your gf has with your sister (and lbr, she thinks you're too close) it won't resolve itself and eventually she'll try to keep you apart because it's not normal, and why would you need to spend time with your sister if you've got a gf to hang out with? The closest you get to being an asshole is if you know this is how she behaves and you stay with her, that sends a message to your sister that your SO can treat her like this and you don't mind because you're getting laid", "NTA\n\nYour g/f is weird. \n\nGo play \"The Last of Us\".", "NTA.

Is this someone you want in your life long-term when she can\u2019t delineate between big brother affection and some perverted attraction? Trust me, this crap doesn\u2019t resolve itself but manifests into some sort of chaos between family and/or your partner.

Telling you to stop calling your sister a nickname is a powerplay to show your sister that she's more important to you than she (sister) is. This is extremely controlling and manipulative.

Your girlfriend on the other hand, there\u2019s a lot wrong with her. She\u2019s jealous of your sister.", "NTA. What freaks me out (other than the weird sexualizing of your sibling bond) is the control. It seems to me like she's \"starting small\" to test the waters. If she can get you to stop using that nickname, next she'll be trying to stop you from hugging her, or seeing her without her. And she'll say \"well you must agree there was something weird cause you stopped calling her babygirl which was messed up\"\n\nBut maybe I'm just me being super reddit about this.\n\nSo let me dial that back.\n\nYour sibling who you adore and your girlfriend don't really get along.

But you\u2019re the AH for continuing to date someone that has had \u2018issues\u2019 with a literal child in the past. Your girlfriend is either jealous as fuck or immature as fuck, maybe a combo.

Move on.", "NTA.\n\nThough, you should very seriously consider if this is a woman you want to stay with.  She dislikes your sister, is demonstrating some jealousy, and is being controlling and toxic over something wildly benign.   These are some serious red flags.", "Nta. Your gf need to grow up", "NTA. But reflect on what your sister has said about her and how your gf now is responding to a 14 year long nickname. She seems to be sexualizing the relationship with you & your sister and throwing a fit. Honestly it\u2019s a red flag for me in addition to the way she treats your sister.

My son calls my daughter baby and he probably will also always call her that. It\u2019s cute and not sexual or romantic. Also sisters are always right about not liking the gfs.
