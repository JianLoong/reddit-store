My GF is throwing a fit over a 14 year long nickname, my sister says she's being dramatic, I want to agree with my sister since I don't see how it's inappropriate or uncomfortable for my GF to watch me call my sister those nicknames but I also don't want to make my GF upset with me over something so small.

That considered, I just want to suggest that you try to think about why that nickname feels so weird to you. Remember, OP was about 15 when his sister was born, so to him she has always been very much a baby. Don't you think it's a little weird that the term \"baby\" is so sexualized in your mind here that it seems inappropriate to call an actual baby sister? I understand those feelings of discomfort, but you may want to ask yourself if they come from that Patriachal, heteronormative place that we all have to unpack and unlearn as we go. That's just my two cents.  No intention to throw shade or be argumentative, just to provoke thought.", "Reread the conversation, I'm simply explaining to the non English first language speaker what they asked. Take your opinion and argue with someone sharing theirs.", "I think it comes from every single time I've been called baby or baby girl as a grown ass woman by complete strangers. I've never heard those terms in a nonsexualized way unless we're talking about a literal infant, so yeah, it's definitely specific to my experience. And GF's experience as well, clearly.\n\nIf you all want to reclaim that phrase, good luck. That will be impossible for me considering I hear \"babygirl\" literally every week at my job from a misogynistic asshole who constantly sexualizes the women at my work. I can't reclaim a phrase that's being constantly used to put me down.\n\nWe women don't always have to do the work you know. Sometimes the onus is on men to not say things we find uncomfortable.", "I'm sorry that has been your experience.  I'm a 34 year old woman and my mom still calls me baby girl every once in a while. I call my niece that, and probably always will. I think calling your actual baby sister \"baby girl\" is less weird to me than a romantic partner using it. I personally am fine with shutting down strangers who feel they can speak to me in an overly familiar or belittling way, but I understand if you don't have the spoons or the freedom to do so. I fully agree that it is on men not to call *us* things that make us uncomfortable,  but op also can't police how he refers to his own family, so long as they are both okay with it. Sometimes we need to work through our own shit, or leave the situation - not try to control someone else's perfectly wholesome and innocent behavior."]}
