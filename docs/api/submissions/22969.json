If you\u2019re team wins the league you get to go to a big tournament later in the year at a big tennis complex in the middle of the state. A men\u2019s team I was on won our league 2 weeks ago, and the big tournament is in 4 months. In order to play at this tournament you need at least 6 players to be able to make it. Of the 9 people on my team 6 including me have said they can make it, while the other 3 can\u2019t make it for various reasons, so we have just enough.\n\n4 months ago my brother (24M), got engaged to his fianc\u00e9 (23F). I was super happy for them and when he asked me to be his best man I of course accepted. They don\u2019t want to wait too long and almost immediately started wedding planning. They plan to just have a small ceremony with close family and friends. Last week my brother told me they were finalizing a date after much delay and mentioned 3 dates on 3 separate weekends the same month I have my tournament, one of which was the weekend of my tournament. I told my brother that I already had plans that weekend and that the other two would be better, though I understood it was their wedding. He sounded like he understood but three days ago he announced to everyone attending that the wedding would be on the weekend of my tournament. I asked him privately why they picked that date, and all he said was \u201cit felt like the right date\u201d to his fianc\u00e9. The wedding and tournament are not close to each other at all so I can\u2019t attend both. After thinking about it for the last two days I told my brother yesterday that I can\u2019t make his wedding. I had already committed to my teammates and if I didn\u2019t go no one could, since we wouldn\u2019t have enough guys. My brother was very upset, and called me various names and said he couldn\u2019t believe I would miss his big day. He told my parents and now they along with a bunch of other relatives are giving me grief for my decision. So AITA? I feel really bad and want to be there but I also did commit to the tournament first and don\u2019t want to let everyone on my team down.", "created_utc": 1690141358, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157o5lb/aita_for_skipping_my_brothers_wedding_to_play_in/", "score": 1614, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They're adults, they'll come around. Your family, on the other side, will not, or it will take years to fix the damage.\n\nBear in mind that even though it was nice of the bride and groom to ask if you were free, picking a date ultimately depends on a ton of factors.

You were unfortunately way too vague and they picked a date that worked best for them, assuming you\u2019d be okay with it because of how you said \u201cat the end of the day though it\u2019s your wedding\u201d, strongly implying you\u2019d make it work either way.\n\nMy advice? Weddings don\u2019t really matter, but relationships do. You absolutely don\u2019t have to go, and your prior plans ARE important, but you kind of failed to communicate that properly, so now the ball is in your court (no pun intended).
