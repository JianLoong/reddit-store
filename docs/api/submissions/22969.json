If you\u2019re team wins the league you get to go to a big tournament later in the year at a big tennis complex in the middle of the state. A men\u2019s team I was on won our league 2 weeks ago, and the big tournament is in 4 months. In order to play at this tournament you need at least 6 players to be able to make it. Of the 9 people on my team 6 including me have said they can make it, while the other 3 can\u2019t make it for various reasons, so we have just enough.\n\n4 months ago my brother (24M), got engaged to his fianc\u00e9 (23F). I was super happy for them and when he asked me to be his best man I of course accepted. They don\u2019t want to wait too long and almost immediately started wedding planning. They plan to just have a small ceremony with close family and friends. Last week my brother told me they were finalizing a date after much delay and mentioned 3 dates on 3 separate weekends the same month I have my tournament, one of which was the weekend of my tournament. I told my brother that I already had plans that weekend and that the other two would be better, though I understood it was their wedding. He sounded like he understood but three days ago he announced to everyone attending that the wedding would be on the weekend of my tournament. I asked him privately why they picked that date, and all he said was \u201cit felt like the right date\u201d to his fianc\u00e9. The wedding and tournament are not close to each other at all so I can\u2019t attend both. After thinking about it for the last two days I told my brother yesterday that I can\u2019t make his wedding. I had already committed to my teammates and if I didn\u2019t go no one could, since we wouldn\u2019t have enough guys. My brother was very upset, and called me various names and said he couldn\u2019t believe I would miss his big day. He told my parents and now they along with a bunch of other relatives are giving me grief for my decision. So AITA? I feel really bad and want to be there but I also did commit to the tournament first and don\u2019t want to let everyone on my team down.", "created_utc": 1690141358, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157o5lb/aita_for_skipping_my_brothers_wedding_to_play_in/", "score": 792, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They're adults, they'll come around. Your family, on the other side, will not, or it will take years to fix the damage.\n\nBear in mind that even though it was nice of the bride and groom to ask if you were free, picking a date ultimately depends on a ton of factors.

He could easily have interpreted \"plans\" to be drinks with friends or tickets for a show or something else casual that it'd be possible for you to cancel or reschedule without consequence. If he didn't know exactly what you had planned or the context then he might not have realised the importance/inflexibility of your prior commitment that day & assumed it was merely a preference.", "Yeah I thought the same thing! OP is NTA regardless, but maybe the phrasing made his brother believe that while it wouldn't be ideal, it was still an option...? That'd be a NAH though, OP's still fine, the phrasing is just a bit confusing.\n\n(The bride is shady for picking the date he couldn't attend just because it 'felt right', though, I'm hoping there are other reasons that OP's brother maybe just didn't want to share with him or something, 'cause otherwise that's pretty shitty of her tbh)", "OP, YTA.\n\nYou didn't say \"I have a pre-existing commitment on this weekend that would mean I'm unable to make it to your wedding\", you said \"I would prefer it not be that weekend, but it's your call\".

This is a communication issue, OP fucked up.", "I seemed to miss the part where the couple was asking guests about the date. From what I read, they just shared 3 possible dates and OP gave input. There was actually no asking the guests involved.", "Since her only reason was that date feels right see obviously didn't want him to be the best man", "He didn't say \"I can't do that weekend\". He said the other two are better, but I understand it's your wedding.  So that's why I am in the middle. Poorly worded, so it's like if you pick that weekend, I understand  it's your wedding (so I will choose you).

Why bother asking then? If the brother had a good reason (more people could make it then, dying relative might not otherwise make, it was the only date we could book our dream venue etc.) then I'd agree, but the brother's complete lack of respect for OP makes me empathise with OP here, especially given that he'd already made a prior commitment to the others on his team. If the brother hadn't asked at all even I might say OP was T A H, but to ask and then ignore without a real reason is a level of disrespect that actually really pisses me off.

Obviously wanted my Dad at my wedding so we got engaged and looked for a venue that could fit us in ASAP. Found a venue who was willing to work with a month's time frame, gave us a Thursday date - which isn't normally ideal due to people working. We invited our guest, apologised for the lack of notice and it bring a work day so would understand if they couldn't attend. But every single person understood the situation and made every effort they could to attend, and I am soooooo grateful for that, I had my wedding with the two men I love most in attendance \ud83d\udc96\nBut that does not seem to be the case with OPs brother, which makes the brother the A H, and OP NTA", "\u2026.

He's not. \n\nOP isn't obligated to attend. An invitation is not a summons. He warned his brother about his availability during the considered period. Brother picked that date. OP not attending is the obvious outcome of that action. OP is not an asshole for keeping his previous engagement. Brother is an asshole for trying to force OP to come anyway.", "A wedding day is not a summons to appear.... especially when the bride and groom knew he was unavailable.", "Wrong.", "a wedding is not a summons. op can choose not to attend for any reason", "I'll admit my first thought was the bride is one of those *aesthetic is life* crystal girlies who have a meltdown if they don't have the water bottle du jour as featured on insta...\nBut your insight also rings true!", "It's probably their own belief that a wedding trumps all other events. Although I'm curious if the tennis match was the Wimbledon final... would it be okay to miss his brother's wedding. At what point is it permissible for OP to miss it and not, to all those that ruled TA.", "You've also missed the point where they need 6 people for the tennis tournament and they have exactly 6. If OP doesn't attend he's denying 5 others the opportunity to attend too. If it was only him missing out then maybe it's less of a conundrum, but it's not.\n\nHe's not telling the brother than he can't have his wedding when he wants, he's just saying he can't attend because of other obligations. Perfectly fair and reasonable.", "Yeah except his brother knew the man he wanted to be his best man had already committed to a tournament and still chose the day. If he doesn't go the entire team doesn't get to play, so it's not exactly fair to be mad at him for not going.\n\nIf OPs brother had informed him of the wedding date before he committed to the tournament and OP didn't go to the wedding then he'd be an asshole but he can't screw his teammates over after he's committed.", "Inless the WoW raid is taking place in a tournament, no, they are not comparable. This isn't a saturday night social get together, this is an organized sport. And if OP doesn't go, he'd be denying 5 others the experience as well. \n\nThe brother was told that weekend was no go beforehand. OP is not selfish for sticking to the plans he already had, and already warned his brother about.", "Physical sports and Esports are different things first of all. Second of all, it's not just a tennis tournament, he is letting down his teammates if he doesn't come to the tournament. Third, his brother had the power to reschedule where OP could attend yet he scheduled it where he couldn't anyway knowing that he has a tournament. If anyone here is selfish, it would you be you u/Purple_Ad2153 , shame on you.", "OP's and fianc\u00e9 are also selfish and entitled, and weddings happen everyday who cares.", "Absolutely. It's not his career either.", "I don\u2019t think it matters.  Maybe I\u2019m just older I don\u2019t know.  OP has to decide who to show up for.  It\u2019s as simple as that.  He\u2019s not an asshole due to the brother and SIL choosing that weekend.  They set this up no doubt and put OP in a bind.  He\u2019s got to live with his choice though.  A tennis team where 3/9 can\u2019t go already.  3 others are already choosing something else over the tourney.  With probable future tennis tourneys available.  That\u2019s a fine choice not to let them down.  Or be there for bro even though he\u2019s an ass.  But show up for your family.  Also a fine choice.  Neither is an asshole choice.  What does OP want out of these relationships in the future?  \n\nSometimes it\u2019s not about right or wrong or technically or asshole or anything.  It\u2019s simply about the choice and the consequence.  Whatever OP chooses is okay and there will be some fallout.", "It's a tennis tournament and is not only up to him. Family takes priority over hobbies. At least that's the values I grew up with.", "For sure, this sub is crazy.", "It's a for fun league. Who cares what the tournament is? Compared to your brother's wedding it's nothing.", "That's what I want to say to every \"once in a lifetime\" response. My brother is currently divorcing his third wife.", "Haha!", "He committed to being best man too. A fun league tournament shouldn't be anywhere near a siblings wedding on someone's priority list, regardless of teammates missing out. They're all adults, they should understand the importance of being best man at your brother's wedding... This thread is insane.", "Maybe you would choose your friends but OP obviously is close with his brother because he was asked to be the best man. It seems to me that this would be messing with a good relationship.", "Uhm no.  Saying my team comes first is not these two are better, it's \"I can't come that weekend, I can only come these two \"", "Thank you for the sweet story. It would be great if OP could make his brother's wedding. It is however odd when asked what date works for him and the couple picking that date that doesn't. The reason given is it felt right.....\n\nWhy ask him in the first place. Clearly he wasn't a priority to attend. Or did they think he would drop everything to attend as wedding invites are non-negotiable for close family in their eyes? Which brings up a whole other level of questions.", "I kind of think that the bride might have chose that date just because OP had said that he couldn't. To make him chose if their wedding or tennis is more important, to start drama.", "There really isn't enough information to say either way. I just find it odd OP gets crap from his brother after being asked what date works for him. Saying hey I have a tournament on that day and when reaching out to say why pick that day when I told you I have a tournament, he is told \"it felt right\". \n\n\nGuess it feels right for him to not attend also. But I'm going to lash out and be a total AH to you.", "OP was, according to his own post, vague about not being able to make it that weekend, and his brother may not have even passed that along to his fiancee, so it's wild that you are spraining your shoulder to make it her fault.", "From what?  He didn't say he couldn't come.  Said other weeks were better, but understands it's his wedding.  Brother might not have even brought it up.", "I do, and some people bring it up for selfish reasons, like to get people excited for the wedding, and nothing else.", "OP didn't say he couldn't come that weekend either. Worst wording.", "Especially with the wishy-washy motivation of \"it felt right\". Like, I also appreciate things like symmetric dates \u00e0 la 01/10 etc. but that doesn't trump a previous commitment.", "I'm gonna disagree here. Bro wanted him to be the best man, asked about dates, and is absolutely TA for ignoring it. If there's a reason, sure, give it.

He seems to spend a lot more time with them.", "To you family to me like friend ship you don't get to guilt me in to being your best man he worked for this worked his brother could of chosen another day but no he chose the one day he was not free", "Yeah the reason given isn't good enough. Sure, the brother and fiance are entitled to the date they want. However, they can't expect OP to just drop something that's very important to him that has been planned for ages and OP warned them of", "Its definitely a possibility. Or the brother could be testing his loyalty or making a power play.   \n\n\n\n\n\nTo be told they picked the day because it felt right, can't sit well with OP.

OP told the brother, but if that wasn't communicated to the bride, she couldn't choose one one of the other dates.", "Based on?", "... why do you think that?", "OP never said he couldn't.

Had he been clear, this may not have happened", "\u2026 and that\u2019s more likely than just to see if there\u2019s any conflicts?", "You're probably right,  I'm a little too generous there.  Asking OP to be best man, asking his availability, completely disregarding that, then getting mad at OP, is AH behavior from the brother.", "Exactly the key is the bride and groom knew prior to deciding on the date OP was busy.", "I highly doubt he would just not mention it.i can't imagine not remembering or choosing not to mention that my best man has plans on a certain weekend", "He told them he had plans that weekend. The other two would be better. That's clear to me.", "Better is carrying the implication that all can work, but some are preferred more than others.\n\nLike, when I'm asked about a few possible times for a meeting (a routine occurance), I often have a \"this would be a better time for me\", but if I have a conflict I can't shift, I will say that explicitly as well.", "Plans is vague and didn\u2019t make it clear he could not attend."]}
