If you\u2019re team wins the league you get to go to a big tournament later in the year at a big tennis complex in the middle of the state. A men\u2019s team I was on won our league 2 weeks ago, and the big tournament is in 4 months. In order to play at this tournament you need at least 6 players to be able to make it. Of the 9 people on my team 6 including me have said they can make it, while the other 3 can\u2019t make it for various reasons, so we have just enough.\n\n4 months ago my brother (24M), got engaged to his fianc\u00e9 (23F). I was super happy for them and when he asked me to be his best man I of course accepted. They don\u2019t want to wait too long and almost immediately started wedding planning. They plan to just have a small ceremony with close family and friends. Last week my brother told me they were finalizing a date after much delay and mentioned 3 dates on 3 separate weekends the same month I have my tournament, one of which was the weekend of my tournament. I told my brother that I already had plans that weekend and that the other two would be better, though I understood it was their wedding. He sounded like he understood but three days ago he announced to everyone attending that the wedding would be on the weekend of my tournament. I asked him privately why they picked that date, and all he said was \u201cit felt like the right date\u201d to his fianc\u00e9. The wedding and tournament are not close to each other at all so I can\u2019t attend both. After thinking about it for the last two days I told my brother yesterday that I can\u2019t make his wedding. I had already committed to my teammates and if I didn\u2019t go no one could, since we wouldn\u2019t have enough guys. My brother was very upset, and called me various names and said he couldn\u2019t believe I would miss his big day. He told my parents and now they along with a bunch of other relatives are giving me grief for my decision. So AITA? I feel really bad and want to be there but I also did commit to the tournament first and don\u2019t want to let everyone on my team down.", "created_utc": 1690141358, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157o5lb/aita_for_skipping_my_brothers_wedding_to_play_in/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The entire point of asking people about the date, when you really want them attendance of your wedding, and in your wedding party, is to ensure the date actually works with their schedule!\n\nFianc\u00e9 sounds like a piece of work.", "NTA. You told him you weren\u2019t available that weekend, if he cared that much about you being there he would have chosen a different date not just assume you would cancel your existing plans.", "NTA. He chose the one weekend you told him you wouldn\u2019t be available. That\u2019s on him.", "NTA it was a pre-existing commitment that he was aware of when he chose the date.

They get to pick their date without regard for the schedules of anyone else. But\u2026. it\u2019s not fair to demand that someone skip a pre-planned event after they knowingly chose to have the wedding at a conflicting time. \n\nIt\u2019s not about prioritizing his hobby, it\u2019s about choosing not to let down 5 friends who worked hard towards an achievement. \n\nObviously, a wedding is a bigger deal than a hobby, but it is really weird to choose a date when the *best man* is unavailable.", ">I told my brother that I already had plans that weekend and that the other two would be better, though I understood it was their wedding.\n\nINFO - Did your brother understand that one specific weekend would not work for you?

NTA", "NTA.  Your brother knew you had a pre existing commitment.  You didn't spring it on him last moment.  Quite the opposite\n\nI would start blocking any family members giving you grief.  You not being there at the wedding will make no impact on your brothers marriage.  \n\nIf he keeps pressing you on it, it would be time to go nuclear and initiate No Contact with him.  \n\nBest of luck on the tournament!", "I'm gonna go with NTA. It sounds like this is important to you, and you told your brother you had another commitment.

You8r brother is letting you down by choosing a day that would sabotage something that is at least as important to you as his wedding is to him.\n\nAnd you should block the flying monkeys. Their opinion is worthless, because they just want what they want and don't care about you at all.\n\nAfter all, it doesn't really matter if this or that person attends, no matter how close to the couple he may be. They just don't like this independent streak.

Your wording sounded more like you'd respect the final choice which *could* entail committing to his day over yours.  There's enough reasonable ambiguity there.  Take the L on this one.", "YTA. Dude this isn't the ATP, your brother will (hopefully) only get married once and it should be something you always remember. Nobody, including you, is going to care about winning a rec league tournament 10 years from now. You're close enough to be his best man, but would skip the whole wedding for something that literally doesn't matter in the scope of your whole life?! I'm a competitive guy and play a couple of sports in a couple of leagues and nobody I play with would want me to skip my brother's wedding.", "You should feel bad because your priorities are all wrong. YTA.", "YTA - this will cause a rift in your family for the rest of your life. There will always be more tennis matches, but only one wedding.", "I'd say YTA, you're changing a once in a lifetime family milestone in which you'd play a big role for a sports event that will likely be held again later on.\n\nYour teammates will be pissed, yeah, but you are bailing to be your brother's best man. They're adults, they'll come around. Your family, on the other side, will not, or it will take years to fix the damage.\n\nBear in mind that even though it was nice of the bride and groom to ask if you were free, picking a date ultimately depends on a ton of factors. I highly doubt your SIL randomly chose the date just to mess with you like your post kinda seems to imply.\n\nThink this over again. Unless you don't really care much about the wedding and your family to begin with and you're just trying to ease your guilt over choosing the event you're honestly more excited about.", "YTA. it\u2019s your brother and he asked  you to be his best man and you accepted. \n\nthe _for-fun_ league is only depending on you because THREE OTHER people already bailed. so obviously it\u2019s not such a serious thing if already 1/3 of the team is not super committed.", "YTA this is the difference between being \"technically right\" and \"morally right\" \u2014 yeah I guess you're in the clear on a technicality...you're going to play lousy anyway knowing you've upset your family and hurt your brother. \n\nYou'll forever be known as the BIL who cared more about his rec tennis league. Not cute.", "Tough situation. You were playing the tennis tournament before the wedding date was planned and your brother knew the date. I think logically you made the right decision. Unfortunately sometimes we have to make sacrifices  to maintain relationships. Maybe this was one of those times. Maybe not . I think ETAH. Your brother didnt even have a specific reason for the date and  didnt seem to ask if you were willing to skip the tennis if that date worked best for him. shitty situation. i probably would have skipped the tennis tournament.", "YTA the first in rule doesn\u2019t apply unless the two events are of equal importance. Brother\u2019s wedding vs tennis game and choosing the game is a huge f you to your brother.", "I genuinely don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re necessarily wrong for not going to the wedding, but YWBTA for missing it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You may be right it may be in-laws or other important people couldn't make the other weekends but that's worth a conversation on the brothers part before he tells him that's the one date he's chosen for the wedding is the date that the OP can't go. We have no idea how close these two are.", "This NTA"]}
