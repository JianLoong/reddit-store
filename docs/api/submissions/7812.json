Typically they wont even send an officer for that but take a report over the phone. But otherwise American cops are completely useless, bordering on dangerous, unless you're actively being stabbed to death.", "I would not call the cops unless someone\u2019s life was in danger and i\u2019d still try for an ambulance instead. cops only bring guns, and they have no legal duty to protect anybody (reaffirmed 3 times in SCOTUS). \n\nso yeah you\u2019re reading that correctly. I absolutely do not trust cops and they WILL make it worse", "I'm pretty sure they were saying there's no point in calling cops if there isn't a risk of violence, not that calling cops presents a risk of violence. You're not wrong though, I'm an American and it's a big reason I wouldn't call cops without a very good reason.\n\nEdit: I'm not just \"pretty sure\", I'm 100% sure. The comment is clear, don't call the cops over an issue THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE a risk of violence. The risk of violence isn't referring to the police at all. \n\n>Also, fuck anybody who decides to call the cops over any issue that doesn\u2019t involve an immediate risk of violence or someone getting hurt.", "Yep. [This woman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Justine_Damond) called the police to report a woman possibly being assaulted. The police turned up, she walked over to their car in her nightclothes and they shot her. Just one of many examples.", "[No, they're still pretty useless when you're being stabbed.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maksim_Gelman_stabbing_spree)", "I called 911 for an ambulance and the cops came too. It did not end well.", "Yeah, I just checked their comment history and I think I was reading their meaning correctly: https://www.reddit.com/r/AntifascistsofReddit/comments/10dqsq6/theyre_admirable_comments_are_abominable/j4pj6cj/", "Uh, what they said is actually pretty unambiguous:\n\n>Also, fuck anybody who decides to call the cops over any issue that doesn\u2019t involve an immediate risk of violence or someone getting hurt.\n\nSo, don't call the cops \"over any issue that doesn\u2019t involve an immediate risk of violence or someone getting hurt.\"", "I know that's what they said. But that means *there's a reason* you wouldn't call cops to deal with nonviolent crimes (since dealing with crimes is, you know, their job). That reason (they didn't state this outright but it's still pretty obvious) is that cops might turn the situation violent themselves."]}
