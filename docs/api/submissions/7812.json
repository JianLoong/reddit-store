Our area is pretty built up, so we go down to the local community oval play 3v3 soccer.

The ovals big so we make sure we're only using a little corner. One of the coaches comes up to us and says \"I'll get you guys to finish up. We're just about to start our practice session.\"  \n We ask if we can just use a corner but he insists they need the whole oval.\n\nWe're a bit confused but clear out none the less, maybe they can book the oval?  \n Instead of going straight home I duck to the shops for a drink. Walking back past I'm annoyed to see them just doing ball drills and sprints and stuff that could easily be done in a quarter of the oval.\n\nI do some research and confirm there is no way to book the ovals, they are shared community resources. Every day I drive past the private school and they have 3 immaculately kept ovals privately fenced in. I keep thinking back to my public school that didn't even have an oval and for sports festivals we needed to walk over to the public fields and we would share with whoever was there.\n\nThursday comes around as I drive home I make note of the 3 completely empty fields at the school (two NRL and a Cricket field) before I join my friends at the oval. We get about 20 minutes into our game before the bus rocks up again.\n\nAs last time, the coach wanders over and tells us to pack it up so they can start practice. I ask them, since they are just doing drills, if we can share and that we will stay out of their way.\n\n\"Sorry guys no can do.\"\n\nI ask why they don't use one of the schools ovals\n\n\"Those are NRL and Cricket ovals, we're an AFL team\u201d\n\nI point out this is a public oval for everyone.   \n At this point the coaches all come over and start asking why we're being so difficult and uncooperative.

They ask what we we\u2019re doing and we explain its 3v3 soccer. They ask us to be mindful to share the oval before going over to talk with the coaches. As they are leaving I ask them what its all about and they tell me they had a call from \"someone\" that we were disrupting the sports team, but as long as we aren't getting in their way, they can\u2019t see anything wrong.\n\nSo we're pretty sure they called the cops on us because we wouldn't leave...\n\nI think its complete crap that a private school can come in and just annex public facilities, but the coaches looks made me feel like I was being a dick.", "created_utc": 1674205580, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gs8s2/aita_for_not_vacating_the_public_oval_so_a/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't let the school prevent you from using that oval. It also seems like such a waste of resource to get the cops involved in this, taking them away from potential life threatening situations. If the cops visit again, explain what happened, how many times it has happened and say you never rang them to report the coaches for bullying as you felt the(the cops) had better things to do with their time. \n\nIf it happens again, I would report the coaches immediately to their school's head / principal.", "NTA fuck those guys and good for you for standing your ground.\n\nFortunately the police didn\u2019t get (too) involved because once they\u2019re introduced into a situation things can go either way, regardless of who is or is not the AH.", "NTA. You sure you don't want to use the center of the oval next time? /s", "NTA. It's a public area. The cops should have laughed in their face and/or reprimanded the coaches for the call.", "NTA. But my suggestion would be to report it to the council (reference to AFL = Aussie in my mind).\n\nLet your local council, who pays for the upkeep of the public park, know that a local private school keeps trying to make you leave the park so they can have exclusive use of it. That they have called the police on you while you were using the park in a shared and neighbourly way to try to force you to leave.\n\nI hate the private school entitlement to public services. My school was private, didn't have their own fields, but acted like the NRL field and netball courts in the park opposite the school belonged to them. They'd get mad if *other local schools* used the park because it was *disruptive* to our school, but hosting other schools from way out of area for footy was perfectly fine.", "NTA. Regardless of if they had somewhere else to practice, the area you were in was public and cannot be reserved. You had just as much right to be there and offered up very reasonable compromises that would ensure everyone could use the space.\n\nCalling the police was a massive AH move and waste of police time. But at least the police themselves confirmed you were doing nothing wrong. Have a good game!", "NTA,  the sense of entitlement is strong with these fools.\n\nI would invite more people down to join you as it is a shared public space. \n\nThey can find a private oval and pay for exclusive use but guess what they have long pockets and short hands. \n\nSo would rather bully you guys away", "NTA. \n\nThat's some serious entitlement happening.", "%200 NTA, you did absolutely nothing wrong there.", "NTA\n\nOpen and shut case", "NTA.", "NTA and I'm dying to know which school this was", "NTA.
