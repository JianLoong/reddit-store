Nope, nope, nope and *nope*. \n\nHave more people there next time. Maybe in different groups on the same oval, that way it looks like you aren't actually there together. One coach picking on one adult group might work. But one coach trying to convince multiple groups to walk off? That's more tricky. \n\nEspecially if you say very loudly, \"Why can't you use the open fields at your school?\"\n\nThen someone from another group can go, \"Wait, you already have fields you can use? Why are you trying to kick us off from here? We have no where else to go, you can go back to your school!\"\n\nThen someone from a different group can chime in with, \"You're trying to get rid of us when this is our only option! No way, that's not fair!\"", "NTA. Next week show up 20 minutes into their practice and tell the coach you need them to wrap up so you can get your practice started", "NTA. Public means public and not having a means of scheduling them means first come first served. They had no right to ask you to leave and were just being entitled dicks. Cops handled it correctly and probably would agree that the entitled private school people were being assholes.", "NTA. They\u2019re acting like they own the place\u2026 which im sure helps them bully other people into vacating. But they have no right to kick others out. Nor are you in conflict with what they\u2019re doing. I don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s so unique about what theyre doing or if there\u2019s anything unique about the fields at their school, but Id imagine it wouldnt be hard for them to do what they need to do at their school fields.", "NTA. I live in a small city and the private high school sometimes does this too. However, the city realizes there are more students enrolled in public schools than private schools so everybody has to share the public park facilities. Most private citizens are at work when the school kids are practicing their sport, though. One nice thing about the private school is that they allow the public middle school to use its track facilities for the physical education classes. I\u2019m glad you put your foot down. If you get any more trouble blast this coach on social media. The entitlement of some private schools is just stomach turning.", "nta.

It's a public space, and they can share. They don't wanna share, they can go back to their private school. So no, you're not the asshole here, but we ALL know who was.\n\nAnd they called the cops. Like this is a matter for law enforcement. No, it's a matter for a civil rights attorney.", "NTA. I would contact the school and the city. That school is using public facilities when they are a private school. If there\u2019s no permit then they have no right and what they did constitutes harassment of private citizens.

He mentions cricket oval. That should be your biggest clue he\u2018s not in America. NRL and AFL are different football leagues in Australia. The 2nd clue was the cops were chill and asked questions, surveyed the scene and said carry on boys. This is quite normal cop behaviour in Australia. Sure you have a few egotistical wankers who are cops but for the most part they\u2019re good guys. We don\u2019t have the same cop culture at all.\n\nBack to OP. NTA Glad you stood your ground. Sounds like the coaches were being elitist bullies.", "NTA\n\nThe coaches are the AH's here.  Their drills were only taking up about half of the oval.  You were not interfering with anything they were doing.\n\nIf they were, say, doing a match which required the whole oval, I could see their point.  As could you, I'm sure.\n\nBut the coaches egos insisted they owned the entire thing.  They do not, which is why the cops just said \"share the oval.\"  Which is what you were doing.", "\"Shared\" community resources means just that.

Did you ask why they aren't using the private school lot.", "I wonder if OP can talk to whoever controls/takes care of/owns the oval about it.

I could see how it would be easy to take the side of kids in this situation for them and I glad they were reasonable!\n\nNTA", "Nah, don\u2019t risk an escalation and don\u2019t immediately threat the private school who probably doesn\u2019t even know about the situation. Be nice and explain the situation, that will probably do more for you.\n\nI\u2019d rather contact whoever is responsible for the public oval and explain the situation to *them* and ask them about this. A statement from them will settle this once and for all.", "Nah, that would be ESH behavior. Don\u2019t escalate this, the school probably doesn\u2019t even know about their coaches behavior.
