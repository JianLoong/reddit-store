I thanked him for letting me know and said I\u2019d be out that night and later going to my parents to house sit. \n\nI went out at 7:30pm, the gf\u2019s party didn\u2019t start until 8pm and when I got back it was midnight, so plenty of time passed. I asked if I could join and they didn\u2019t mind but that may have been out of politeness. I had a few drinks out and few more and I guess I was really chatty because my roommate pulled me aside and said I was taking the attention away from his gf. I immediately apologized and excused myself to bed. Everyone continued going for a few hours and I even had to put a towel along the door to muffle the sound and light but it was still very noticeable. \n\nThe next day I packed up my stuff and headed straight to my parents. I\u2019ve had this sickening feeling ever since. I\u2019ve asked a few people and they thought I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, with one person saying that I lived there so it\u2019d be weird if I didn\u2019t join (also I wouldn\u2019t have been able to sleep if it was still that loud) and if it was for her birthday, why wasn\u2019t it at her place (she lives alone)? But still feel I shouldn\u2019t have joined, just have gone to bed or left for my parents that night. I even said to my friend I should apologize directly to the gf but they said it may cause more drama if she wasn\u2019t upset and my roommate was just annoyed I joined in. I\u2019ve joined in and said hi when he\u2019s had other friends over but I usually stick to myself because I know he doesn\u2019t like when I linger too long. I know I can be a little awkward at times, I have anxiety and am quite introverted. But I\u2019m usually a very good roommate, cleaning up after myself and and don\u2019t have people over often (usually I go out). In this case even, I had been out for majority of the night, and I was coming back late so I wasn\u2019t there for majority of it. \n\nAITA? I\u2019m also a little nervous when I go back\n\nEdit: I thought I was going to be out longer that night but my friends all got tired.

Lol yuck.", "Info what is the context behind him saying that? Were you causing a scene? Did you get wasted? Were you just talking to people?", ">I was taking the attention away from his gf.\n\n\nINFO: were you entertaining everyone with a gymnastics routine or swallowing swords, etc?  I fail to see how talking to people AT A PARTY is stealing attention from the GF.\n\nSomeone sounds insecure.   NTA.", "NTA.\n\nIF SHE LIVES ALONE, SHE COULD HAVE THE PARTY AT HER PLACE. BECAUSE ROOMMATE SITUATIONS ARE WEIRD. HE'S BEING WEIRD THOUGH. TAKING ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE BIRTHDAY GIRL? NUHUH. PARTIES ARE USUALLY WHERE PEOPLE DO ALOT OF CATCHING UP...

There is no rule that everyone must talk to or listen to the person whose birthday it is.

Like your friend said because you live there it would have been weird if you ignored everyone and went straight to bed.\n\nYou mentioned in the past he doesn't like it when you linger too long when he's having friends over. What's his reason for this? Have you done something before? His reason for not wanting you around needs a little more context and doesn't make any sense. Also I feel like this is making you anxious in our own home OP and that's not fair to you. I think you need to have an open conversation with your roommate about why he's being so odd about you interacting with his friends", "No, you're NTA and have nothing to feel ashamed over. You seemed to have given them plenty of space considering it's your home too then gave them more happily when your roommate asked for it. If there's any problem from your roommate, then he's TA. But don't assume there will be and force an awkward encounter.", "NTA", "NTA.  Roommates is a weird relationship.  I would consider a roommate a plus one to events where we lived absolutely yes, your choice if you want to attend or bounce.  That said, it sounds like you should now and moving forward, talk out boundaries and expectations with roommates to avoid awkwardness in the future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
