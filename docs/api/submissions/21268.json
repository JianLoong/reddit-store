She had hyperemesis which means she had been vomiting daily along with having heartburn. The day her water broke, she tells me that she does not want to announce the birth to anyone until she takes specific pictures. I agree.\r  \n\r  \nIt's the due date and my wife goes into labor but I dismiss everyone trying to contact me. My wife gets stuck in 7 cm dilation and has to get a c-section which she did not want. \r  \n\r  \nIt was quite a journey. But nonetheless, my daughter was born a healthy baby and holding her in my arms was a spiritual experience to me. I was so in the moment that I thought of my mom who lost her youngest son (my brother) last year and then sent her texts announcing the birth. I then remembered I can't announce it yet and deleted it before she could see. \r  \n\r  \nFew hours later, my wife wakes up and  I ask if we can announce. She says no, we have to get her in a specific outfit and with a board showing her weight, birth and name. We set this up but she doesn't want to take the picture because she's too tired.  I'm like fine.\r  \n\r  \nAt this point, for hours now, I've been dismissing my mom because she saw the missing calls and deleted texts and knows we're in the hospital. She is worried sick and I tell her 'it's nothing, I cant talk to you right now'. \rIt hits 11:30 PM,  about to be the next day and Ive been lying as if my daughter wasnt just born. I don't like lying so I am getting very uncomftorable.\r  \n\r  \nIt hits 12 and we get to the post partem room and I ask can we take the pic and announce now and she says no, it's too dark for a photo. She says we will wait til the morning. My mom is worried sick and texting me constantly and not going to sleep until I tell her what's going on.\r  \n\r  \nSo we argue about this for a bit and I'm telling her I understand you went through hell and I've been with you every step of the way. But this was a very emotional moment for me too and I really would have loved to share it with the person that brought me into this world. I waited all day for this picture and to then be told not to take it because of lighting is a bit much.. especially after having to lie about my daughters birth when lying is so out of character for me.   \n\r  \nI would have never agreed to these terms if I knew it would be to announce the next day. She then tells me its not about me and my emotions dont matter. My mom does not take precedence over her, especially after all that she went through. She cries and tells me how horrible I am for even arguing about this after her c section. \r  \n\r  \nI couldn't keep up with the lie and ended up texting my mom a few hours later (2 AM) that my daughter was born. But I told her I wouldnt send pics til morning. She scolded me for lying to her when the baby had been born hours ago and found me to be so cruel for that. Nonetheless, she announced in the family group chat that she is a grandmother but then deleted it right away after I told her (noone saw since it was so late).\r  \n\r\r  \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1688431842, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14q09yr/aita_for_announcing_birth_to_mother_after_wifes/", "score": 1454, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She needed to regain control of a situation that went out of control. She needed to take a breath and process the surgery she just had. She needed to focus on the baby and herself. \n\nI get that you wanted to share the exciting news but she really needed you there.", "YTA\n\nHow hard would it have been to say \"Everyone is fine and safe.  We're exhausted and I'm turning off my phone.  Details coming tomorrow. \"\n\nYour mom literally tried to announce it to the family.   Don't you think there is a reason that your wife didn't want her to know immediately?  \n\nGet your head out of your mom's ass and start being there for your wife and kid.  They should be your #1 priority.", "So you were handed your new baby and your first thought was about your mother.\n\nYour wife woke up after a traumatic major medical procedure and, again, your first thought was about your mother.\n\nYour mother hounded you for *twelve hours* over a deleted text.\n\nYour mother scolded and guilt tripped you, a whole ass adult, for not immediately telling her something that was none of her business.\n\nYour mother then took it upon herself to announce news that was not hers to share.\n\nAre we seeing a problem here? It doesn't matter *how* your wife wanted to announce the birth of her child, it was her announcement to make, with you, as a family. Telling people you've  just had a baby comes with a lot of people then bothering you about the baby. She deserved time to recover and spend time alone with her husband and daughter until she was ready to take on that social obligation. And that's all it is - a social obligation - no one else is entitled to this information", "YTA. You say in a comment that your wife had an emergency c-section, the anesthesia failed, and she felt the herself get cut open. Why in the world where you even thinking of your mother's feelings during this time!? And then to argue with your wife and end up telling your mother anyways... yikes. I hope your wife has family or friends close by who can be a real support to her, because it looks like you're failing her miserably", "YTA\n\nYour wife likely delayed because she was under a shitload of stress and pain and a gazillion things to manage. Having a C-section is not a party. \n\nYour wife lost control of pretty much everything in her life the last few months and during labor. You do realize that if she did not have a C-section, your wife and your child would be dead, right? That\u2019s how dangerous her labor was. \n\nThis was the one thing she could control, and you took that away from her.", "YTA. Sorry, but your mom does not tump your wife, especially when wife just had a traumatic c-section. There\u2019s a big difference between \u201cit\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t talk to you now\u201d and \u201ceveryone is okay, I\u2019ll call you tomorrow.\u201d \n\nI guess I just can\u2019t relate to your position. When I was pregnant, I heard and read horror stories about husbands being completely consumed and utterly distracted by their families and cell phones. I told my husband that I didn\u2019t want either of our families to know when I went into labor. I didn\u2019t want any of them to worry and I didn\u2019t want him constantly trying to update people (although in retrospect, both my mother and his parents would have handled it just fine and no one would have created any drama). He agreed and honored our agreement. Once baby arrived, he called his side and I called mine. Easy peasy.", "YTA, that is your wife and at the time she wanted peace and quiet due to everything she went through, I get you wanted to be proud of your daughter coming into this world but when in that room it's all about her and the baby.", "Yes. YTA. It\u2019s not about your mother. You are an adult, and your mother still gets to scold you and guilt you? You are \u201ccruel\u201d for not telling her soon enough? That is not what \u201ccruel\u201d means. You told her the news your wife wasn\u2019t ready to share, and the first thing she did was announce it to the whole family? Even if she backtracked, that\u2019s probably at least part of the reason your wife didn\u2019t want to share except on her terms. You need to work on your guilt about your mother and her power over you, or your wife is going to have a big problem with her role in your lives.", "YTA. Regardless of my opinion on needing the perfect picture to announce, you shouldn\u2019t have told her knowing she wasn\u2019t on board. It was a matter of hours, not days and choosing to prioritize your mom over your wife who had just gone through surgery bringing life into the world was the wrong call \n\nAnd based on the group chat situation, maybe part of the reason your wife didn\u2019t want your mom to know until she was \u201cready\u201d with the right picture to post it to social media is because she knew your mom would start spreading it around", "YTA\n\nFor agreeing to something then going behind her back. For the initial text to your mom that set this whole thing off. For stoking your mom\u2019s concern - you could have texted your mom \u201cWe\u2019re all okay but need some time, I\u2019ll update you tomorrow\u201d. You could have texted her any number of things better than \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I can\u2019t talk right now\u201d. For the first question you asked your wife when she woke from a sleep post-birth being about announcing rather than how she\u2019s feeling, and for being annoyed that she\u2019s tired. For arguing with her. Also for presenting this as if you\u2019d been waiting FOREVER when you texted your mom within two hours of getting to the post partum room.\n\nYour mom is also an AH for continuing to hassle you when she knew you couldn\u2019t talk, for scolding you instead of for sharing joy, for calling you cruel, and for announcing the news in the family group chat. She shouldn\u2019t get a free pass with \u201cnoone saw since it was so late\u201d. It was not her announcement to make. I can see why your wife didn\u2019t want you to tell her before she was ready to share.", "[removed]", "YTA.  Please explain how your mother takes precedence over your wife here.", "Thanks to everyone who gave me honest answers. I needed outside perspective. I agree that I was an asshole in this situation. For one, I made the mistake of texting my mother about 2 hours after the birth. Even if I deleted the text, I started the domino effect of all that occurred and made things worse with every correction. \n\nSure, I was overwhelmed with emotion but I could have thought about what my wife went through in that moment and not succumbed to texting my mom. I know the loss of her son/my brother is still fresh but this is my daughter/wife/me moment and no one else should take any sort of precedence over that. \n\n\rDespite me deleting the texts, I could have much better communicated with my mother and let her know everything is fine and that we will speak tomorrow.  My texts were the kind of texts that would make people worry sick. I handled that poorly. \n\n\rAnd sure, I felt bamboozled over getting the opportunity to take the picture she wanted a number of times but getting rejected for it until finally, getting it delayed to the next day. I personally don\u2019t think the \u2018right\u2019 photo is more important than the moment itself. But that\u2019s just my opinion and if I agreed to something then I ought to stick to my word.  \n\n\rAnd to argue with my wife over that in such a vulnerable moment is what inevitably makes me an asshole. She just went through a traumatic birth and this should not have been a topic of discussion. It wasn\u2019t an argument at first, as it was more of me asking but I did get argumentative the moment she told me my emotions don\u2019t matter right now. I will still say I believe that to be wrong because it was my daughters birth as well and at the very least, my emotions should be considered.\n\n\rNonetheless, my mother knowing if the baby is all right was not more important than my wife being at peace. My mother being anxious was not my wifes fault. It was mine and I should have worked on resolving that on my own with better communication. \n\n\rI think me justifying my actions and believing me not to be the asshole comes from a place of me believing my intentions were good and that I tried to do the right thing in this situation. But intentions don\u2019t so much as matter as of how our actions make people feel. And my actions both made my wife and my mother feel like shit so inevitably, I am the asshole. I will apologize and again, thank you all for your honesty.", "You just showed your wife that you will always prioritize your mother over her.\n\nGood luck with that.\n\nYTA", "Your mom sent you on a guilt trip, for sure. I\u2019m guessing that is exactly why your wife wanted you to wait to tell your parents\u2026..\n\nYTA", "YTA. Your wife made a request and you agreed. Then you went behind her back, minutes after her c section, changed your mind and made your mom worried sick. Instead of apologizing to your wife, you start to argue, again right after she gave birth and is probably a total mess from this experience. \n\nI understand you wanted to share with your mom, but you should not have agreed on the announcement.", "YTA - especially since she IMMEDIATELY texted the group chat. Only reason no one saw it was because it was at 2am. \n\nThis is not about your mother, it\u2019s about your wife that was just cut open to give birth to your child.", "Eh I will say ESH. \n\nYou\u2019re wife for worrying more about a suitable social media post instead of letting family and friends know that she and baby were both healthy and ok. Also for saying you\u2019re feelings don\u2019t matter. \n\nYou\u2019re mom for trying to announce it to the family instead of keeping it quiet like you asked. \n\nAnd you for going back on what you agreed to. Though you suck the absolute least in this situation.  Still ended up being a shitty situation. \n\nIt should have been a no brainer to let immediate loved ones know that both baby and mom were ok while still giving no other details until new mom was ready to post pictures.", "YTA, sorry but your feelings don't matter in that moment. You will be an equal parent to your kid (assuming that's what you want) but you aren't on the day your wife is giving birth. If there is ever a time that anyone is allowed to be unreasonable, it's during and immediately after labour.\n\nYour mother's first instinct was to share the news without asking permission, proving your wife was right to delay until ready to announce more widely.\n\n(p.s. congratulations)", "Wow so rather than been in the moment with your new daughter and wife who was put out to it for delivery. You gotta get that text out to your mother and she has to announce she\u2019s a grandma\n\nYour mother need to know she\u2019s not a priority wtf telling you failed  as a son\n\nYou wife may of just wanted bonding time your new daughter and you  she has just been through a very traumatic birth", "NTA - maybe ill get downvoted to hell for this \n\nBut i think your wife was being unreasonable for this. Clearly she just went through a massively traumatic experience, but insisting on a specific outfit and photo to merely tell someone your daughter was born is a little ridiculous. Its not like you were posting pics of the newbown all over the internet, you just wanted to let your family know she was born.", "What\u2019s done is done. This seems like an overall horrible situation. I don\u2019t know how I would of acted in either of you or your wife\u2019s situations and I can empathize with both of you. I would absolutely want to tell my family everything is ok but I can also understand your wife just needing this one thing to feel in control again. To me, the only AH is your mom for calling you cruel. That was unnecessary in an already stressful situation and served no purpose other than make you feel guilty. Congratulations, I hope your wife\u2019s recovery is going well and that you will be over to get over this quickly and focus on your daughter!", "NTA.

Giving birth is no excuse for that.", "NTA-your wife's feelings are valid as are yours.  But, her actions were unreasonable.  If there is missing info that maybe your wife was expecting your mother to overstep boundaries,  show up, and make the birth all about Grandma, I will change my vote.

Yes, OP agreed to something that sounded reasonable on paper but it was no longer reasonable as his wife continued to move the goal posts. Then she disregarded his feelings about the matter entirely.

Honestly, I think focusing on getting the \u201cperfect picture\u201d with the perfect outfit and the perfect lighting is not the most important thing. I understand wanting to wait due to medical reasons, but because of photos? \nI feel bad for your mom, who probably was terrified something bad happened to her grand bay. \nI\u2019m a new mother who has a c section two months ago and I get how hard it is. But I also made sure that select family were kept in the loop; it can be so hard for them as well.

I can understand why she would want space after birth and allowed time but she should at least not have you be in a position where you have to ghost your own mother.\n\nYour mother is already aware your wife went into labor, so it's not irrational for her to worry with the lack of contact. However, you should have communicated better to her that some space is wanted during this time. You could have told her everything is fine and the both of you need some time without directly going against your wife's wishes. \n\nAnd I think your mother is being a bit of an asshole by focusing on the idea of being a grandmother and the need to announce it, it makes it seem like that's all she cared about and not the wellbeing of you and your wife.", "ESH\n\nMy kids were all born before social media so I\u2019m not exactly sure of the \u201cannouncement picture etiquette\u201d but I find it ridiculous that family cannot know that mom & baby are fine & healthy before the \u201cspecific pictures\u201d are taken.

She had hyperemesis which means she had been vomiting daily along with having heartburn. The day her water broke, she tells me that she does not want to announce the birth to anyone until she takes specific pictures. I agree.\r  \n\r  \nIt's the due date and my wife goes into labor but I dismiss everyone trying to contact me. My wife gets stuck in 7 cm dilation and has to get a c-section which she did not want. \r  \n\r  \nIt was quite a journey. But nonetheless, my daughter was born a healthy baby and holding her in my arms was a spiritual experience to me. I was so in the moment that I thought of my mom who lost her youngest son (my brother) last year and then sent her texts announcing the birth. I then remembered I can't announce it yet and deleted it before she could see. \r  \n\r  \nFew hours later, my wife wakes up and  I ask if we can announce. She says no, we have to get her in a specific outfit and with a board showing her weight, birth and name. We set this up but she doesn't want to take the picture because she's too tired.  I'm like fine.\r  \n\r  \nAt this point, for hours now, I've been dismissing my mom because she saw the missing calls and deleted texts and knows we're in the hospital. She is worried sick and I tell her 'it's nothing, I cant talk to you right now'. \rIt hits 11:30 PM,  about to be the next day and Ive been lying as if my daughter wasnt just born. I don't like lying so I am getting very uncomftorable.\r  \n\r  \nIt hits 12 and we get to the post partem room and I ask can we take the pic and announce now and she says no, it's too dark for a photo. She says we will wait til the morning. My mom is worried sick and texting me constantly and not going to sleep until I tell her what's going on.\r  \n\r  \nSo we argue about this for a bit and I'm telling her I understand you went through hell and I've been with you every step of the way. But this was a very emotional moment for me too and I really would have loved to share it with the person that brought me into this world. I waited all day for this picture and to then be told not to take it because of lighting is a bit much.. especially after having to lie about my daughters birth when lying is so out of character for me.   \n\r  \nI would have never agreed to these terms if I knew it would be to announce the next day. She then tells me its not about me and my emotions dont matter. My mom does not take precedence over her, especially after all that she went through. She cries and tells me how horrible I am for even arguing about this after her c section. \r  \n\r  \nI couldn't keep up with the lie and ended up texting my mom a few hours later (2 AM) that my daughter was born. But I told her I wouldnt send pics til morning. She scolded me for lying to her when the baby had been born hours ago and found me to be so cruel for that. Nonetheless, she announced in the family group chat that she is a grandmother but then deleted it right away after I told her (noone saw since it was so late).\r  \n\r\r  \nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He was there, the whole time. It is not like he left to give the news to his mother. He stayed with her the whole time.\n\nFurthermore, if my daughter in law was in the hospital, no one was responding to the texts, I would be very worried, like his mother was. She was freaking out, wouldn't go to sleep until she found out everyone was okay, and wanted to ensure her son and daughter in law were okay.  Sending a text saying, \"The baby was born.

His mom knew something was up, and it\u2019s not fair to let her worry in the dark like that. His wife wanted this \u201cspecific\u201d picture before she thought she would have a C-section. Also, announcing to grandparents is not the same as a general announcement and doesn\u2019t need a special outfit, background and lighting. Honestly, wife sounds a bit insufferable.

The wife is the priority but everyone\u2019s acting like the father is just a supporter to the birth and nothing else. The birth of his child is extremely important to him and so is his mom, regardless of her craziness. Having to lie about one of the most important moments of your life happening is really difficult. He only wanted to tell one person, he didn\u2019t intend to take control of the announcement from her.", "NTA, As a dad, I found the six months before and the first few months after my daughter's birth to be weird in the sense that everyone both wanted me to know how important my involvement was but also didn't give a shit about me in any sense. \"Our\" OBGYN made a big thing about it on our first visit and then went months without speaking to me at all, not even a hello when we would come for an appointment. Like, it was really awkward to walk into a room with someone and have them be really warm and welcoming with my wife and literally not acknowledge my existence in any way. Everyone seems to want to walk this weird line where the father is both an equal partner and also completely irrelevant. Fuck that.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is just as much OP's kid as it is wife's. Her social media nonsense didn't trump his right to tell his mom about the birth of his child. He played along for a while but when it was clear the picture wasn't happening that night anymore he did what he wanted.\n\nHonestly, the amount of people saying he's the asshole for telling his mom he had a kid is disturbing.

For me, I had to ask my husband not to send photos of my newborn to his mom after the birth because I know for a fact that she'll immediately post them on social media before I do. She's just an excited grandma but it won't feel special anymore.\n\nHeck, I shared pics of my C-section to my mom, and she sent it to MIL too, who then shared it with her relatives. They're excited, they're good people, but sometimes announcements like these would really be better to have to come from the mom first. I felt like all my boundaries were crossed that day.", "I\u2019m sorry you went through that. My third baby passed when she was 5 months old. It\u2019s a shitty club to join. Which makes situations like this post just ridiculous to me. Who gives a shit who announces when, just let the family who loves you know that everything went alright.", "Such bullshit. A father's feelings are as equally valid as the mother's.", "This. His mom immediately made an announcement in the family group chat, attempting to take that attention for herself...

And it\u2019s not like he was sticking a camera in the woman who just had a Cc section\u2019s face\u2026 it was about if they can take a pic of THE BABY on the board with height and weight. Something that is purely aesthetic and there\u2019s plenty of time to do that. He could have sent the exact text you wrote to his mother, then waited to do the stupid pic with the board to announce to everyone else. Wife could have worked with him. At the and of the day I mean I disagree with him telling the mother, I think in that situation i would have done whatever my wife wanted. but I\u2019d be really having to think long and hard about how I wound up married and having a kid with someone who won\u2019t work with me on little disagreements", "Exactly. Wife gave no leeway for anything. I\u2019m inclined to say ESH, but the whole thing is just really strange.", "Huh?

So where do you get the idea that OP wanted to say everyone was ok?", "He says he told his mom things were fine and he couldn't talk, but she wouldn't stop texting him anyway. For hours. Presumably she thought his wife was in labor and kept blowing up his phone in that moment?", "I can agree NAH.  Wife was legitimately not in a sound mind so her actions get a pass.", "According to his comments she had an emergency c-section and had to be put under general anesthesia because the epidural didn't work and she had to feel them cutting her open. So her last memory before being knocked out was excruciating, horrifying, terrifying pain. She was out for 3 hours and likely woke up not even knowing if her baby was alive. Coming out of anesthesia takes time and can be incredibly confusing and scary, especially when you weren't expecting it.", "Some people view babies as part of a family, others view them as accessories.", "Then he shouldn't have agreed with his wife to not tell people. Op is TA for the sole fact that he agreed to something and then went back on his word, breaking his wife's trust when she was in an extremely vulnerable position. If he hadn't agreed, she probably could have kept him out of the delivery room/ hospital until she was ready for the world to know. This woman had a major surgery unexpectedly and his worry was about telling his mommy?", "It didn't take two days. And even if it did, so what? Who matters more when a child is born: the child's parents or the child's grandparents?\n\nWe had a similar, though not as long, delay announcing our daughter's name/announcing her birth to most people. I had a planned C-section, which went really well. But the first time I got to hold her, a few hours after she was born, she stopped breathing. She was rushed to the NICU.\n\nWe had a special blanket, the trendy wooden name sign, and a particular outfit in our bags to take a photo to announce her name with. I know part of it is silly trends, but I was SO excited to get this picture. I put a lot of time into picking the right sign and outfit. My husband found just the right blanket he loved. It was going to be such a fun little memory and a cute photo.\n\nBut that moment was taken from me. My daughter was in the NICU and I was physically unable to even stand. I lost all control. I didn't even know what would happen to my daughter. Was the first time I held her the last? I didn't know. It was scary. And that was on top of the physical pain of major abdominal surgery. I hurt, I couldn't move, people were coming in to press on my uterus every few hours. It's brutal.\n\nFamily hounded us all day for her name. A few even hounded us a but to announce it. But I wouldn't do it until I got my photo. Because if I could go to the NICU, dress my daughter up in her little outfit, put on her silly bow, and wrap her in her special blanket it meant things would be okay.\n\nWhen the epidural finally wore off enough that I could stand long enough to be helped into a wheelchair, probably 8 hours after I last saw my daughter, my priority was being with her. Everyone else's whining about the name or the announcement could wait.\n\nA few hours later I was feeling good enough to go again. This time we brought the little bag of stuff. The NICU nurses were excited to help us get her all set up for cute photos. They made sure you couldn't see all the wires or the terrifying IV in her hand. Getting to have that moment as a family, when we were all okay enough to enjoy it, was really nice.\n\nThe pictures are still some of my absolute favorites. Everyone was just as excited to learn her name or that she'd been born. The anticipation or complete surprise (depending on the person) seemed to make it more fun for some people. No one whined or complained. Even those who hounded us about her name or the announcement were so excited by the news that the wait no longer mattered. No one held a grudge. No one was truly mad.\n\nA few hours, or even a few days, is no time at all in the grand scheme of things. A C-section is a huge thing to go through. It's major abdominal surgery. An emergency C-section is even worse. It can be extremely scary and traumatic, depending on why it was needed and/or what happened. Needing time to come to terms with the experience or even just rest from it is completely normal. There's also nothing wrong with mom and/or dad wanting time with baby before bringing the rest of the world into it. Having private time together, as a new family, is so special. Not having any interruptions allows you to enjoy the experience together.", "Well to be fair, she\u2019s literally the main character in the birth of her children.", "I doubt it was actually about the picture. She likely just wanted it to be them for a bit.", "if your body gets cut open, you are in fact the main character and should be treated as such!", "Who do you imagine should be the main character in this scenario?", "Totally ridiculous.  Social media is going to destroy us all.  And to act like this was not his baby also.  This is bizarre behavior.", "Your calling someone who pusher a watermelon sized human out of her the main character energy... ya relize labour is considerd a medical emergency right? That couples can take weeks to announce it? Why wouldnt the one recovering from a medical surgery not be the center of making choices? Why cant she chose to wait till she feels better to do this? Why dose it have to be right now?\n\nAlso i get the point of \"well he is the dad\". Well his job is to support the person who just put thier body threw turama to birth his kid. Not to heed everyone eles in the world.", "Fully agree.

Can't announce until she takes a picture. Screams Instagram.\n\nWhile childbirth sucks and the mother is probably traumatized, this is because of a picture. The husband can't tell his mother because of a certain picture.  Not health reasons, not I just want to hold my baby, but a staged picture.\n\nNtA", "Omg i agree with you. It is ridiculous", "I agree.  The grandparents and aunts and uncles etc are usually dying to find out all is well and what the baby is,  after all they have been through the journey with the couple as well.  It is rude and cruel to not to let them know so they can stop worrying that something went wrong and so they can also be happy for the couple.  It isn't about the prime photo op.  What is wrong with people these days and their self centeredness?", "A grandmother whose been up her kids asses with baby rabies wrote this then a bunch more liked it.", "That's because she is the main character.", "The mom IS the main character in this situation.

No. And I had a C-section so don't say I don't get it.  It's HIS baby, too.", "Telling his mother would have taken a minute, while putting her off all day took more time and attention. \n\nThe baby is his baby too.

I\u2019m sure his wife will be just fine sparing 20 seconds of attention.", "Exactly.", "More than likely she\u2019s putting off the photo because she isn\u2019t ready for visits and calls/texts. \nShe knows once she takes it he\u2019s going to tell everyone because he basically started pressing her the moment she came to about it. \nPutting the photo off is the only way to put the announcement off because he literally cannot respect her need to heal.", "I really doubt it\u2019s all for insta but rather for herself too. OP stated that this pregnancy was horrible and even the birth was painful / more painful than usual so she probs just wanted a cute pic for herself too after all this suffering. \n\nAlso, as other comments have stated this is likely in part bc she doesn\u2019t want to deal w messages. I recently also had a major life change and waited a few days to announce / post because I knew if I did immediately I wouldn\u2019t get to be as present in that moment. And Op\u2019s mom shared the news w everyone which was probs anticipated.", "The poor girl has been out of control of her body the entire pregnancy. She had to have an emergency c-section. The epidural failed, so she FELT her abdomen get sliced open during her c-section. The pictures she wanted were the only thing about her birth that she could control. \n\nThrowing around buzzwords like narcissist at a new mom who is has went through a shit ton of physical trauma, emotional trauma, and a massive cascade of hormones? Gross and immature.", "Definitely. I get that she clearly had some perfect vision in her mind for how it would all play out. And I get that it all went pear shaped. But, it\u2019s still his child, too. He should get to decide when to tell his own family the same way she should. I think she\u2019s the one who took a beautiful moment and turned it into a big drama all for the sake of a \u201cperfect\u201d instagram pic. He didn\u2019t choose his mother over his wife.  He chose his wife over everyone right up until she told him that his feelings, his opinion, and his wishes don\u2019t matter to her.  If this is how it\u2019s going to be, he\u2019s doomed.", "Wife straight up telling OP that his emotions don\u2019t matter. This kind of stuff bugs me.

Immediately blabbed when asked not to.", "Yes. A quick call or a text informing OP's mother that everything is ok and the baby is born wouldn't ruin \"the perfect photo\" and social media announcement.  \nI think the wife was a little delusional or uninformed, how it is to give a birth.

Would she wait with the picture some weeks? Ridiculous.", "Her request is reasonable for posting a first picture. But not even being able to TELL people? Fuck that. That\u2019s just to get more attention for the precious photo op.\n\nETA: To be clear, I\u2019m speaking of the decision beforehand.

And I\u2019m saying this as a mother who gave birth just two months ago. The disregard for the birthing parents emotions and well being is definitely getting out of hand.

I had two babies and c sections and I would be lying if I said I thought anyone calling the next day was curious about me and that\u2019s the way it should be. Because I\u2019m an adult, who doesn\u2019t need constant attention and praise. This is just the beginning of a life of \u201cit\u2019s not about me\u201d NTA to dad. It would be one thing if neither parent wanted to announce but he did, so while they don\u2019t \u201cowe\u201d it to anyone, sometimes dads need support too. Especially during the childbirth process when dads are told they need to step up, bond with this baby, and be present while also having less say and less importance just because\u2026. They are dad? No fair, this is about dads too!!", "OP just had to watch his wife go through major surgery and could discuss his feelings about that with ANYONE for the sake of a photo op.

She knew they were in the hospital and she was worried sick. I would never have done that to family for a fucking photo. That's absolutely ridiculous.", "And she is not entitled to force someone to lie about having a child. What a ridiculous take. Not allowing anyone to know you had a child for days for the sake of an insta moment is not healthy well adjusted behavior.

He should be able to. New Moms don't Trump dads. Medically she wins but this ISN'T medical. It's just controlling what she can because she feels vulnerable. It's toxic and needs to stop.\n\nI'm sick and tired of this generations new mothers twisting the birth celebration into something about just them. It's not. The hospital stay and recovery is about you. But the baby is a a celebration for an entire family, both sides. \n\nAnd before anybody gets upset about my 'this generation' comment- I AM a part of this generation of moms. Both my ex husband and my mom were there. My dad doesn't like hospitals. My ex isn't close to his parents. Everyone knew in the family chats. Family and friends trickled in for visits to see my son in the NICU window and stayed no more than five minutes with me. I was told my son would have cerebral palsy. He made an amazing recovery from his brain bleed and traumatic birth. I knew family and friends care and wanted to express both love and concern. Isolating a new baby is NOT normal for mammals. It's weird. The same support during hard times became bonded to you through positive moments that produce serotonin, dopamine etc. The biggest producer of those happy chemicals is being around a baby! The same people that help you want to express and feel joy for you and your baby as well!", "It's all so stupid and superficial that I just can't take it seriously.

It's no picnic, and the focus immediately afterward should be on her and what she needs to recover. \n\nHe should be having some emotions about his wife, and his baby, and how best to support them at that time. And be a little less focused on his mom. Have patience, let the inequality of labor slowly rebalance. Her pain, her recovery, her emotions ARE the higher portion for a time. Marriage is a give and take and a balance. It's not always 50-50 everything. \n\nIf she phrased it badly in the moment, again give her grace for the situation she's in.

It\u2019s bordering insanity, the photo and social media thing. Op is def NTA. \nI mean, first of all, childbirth sucks. There\u2019s so many risks, and it can definitely be a traumatic experience. There\u2019s a lot you can\u2019t control, and while OP\u2019s wife had a rough experience, her making OP feel bad about it complains about what she \u201chad to go through\u201d just feels manipulative.\n\nI had a very traumatic experience with my first emergency c-section to the point that I could feel the incision being made and they couldn\u2019t get my son out fast enough so they had to quickly use general anesthesia as well and knock me out. Afterwards, I was hemorrhaging and needed pretty significant medical care afterwards. I was a physical and emotional train wreck. Sharing anything besides \u201ceveryone\u2019s ok\u201d with family wasn\u2019t really a possibility until I wasn\u2019t half-dead and the trauma had worn off a little. My ex-husband sent a general text out to all in-laws right after the birth just to let everyone know we were ok and details later, since everyone was worried. I was completely ok with that and appreciated him letting grandparents know all was ok so they weren\u2019t anxiety ridden and worried.\nSometime the next day, I got my emotions together enough to have my husband send a text out with a couple pics and more details, but certainly not for social media and nothing staged on certain outfits or anything ridiculous. \n\nIf OP\u2019s wife was really genuinely a physical and emotional dumpster fire after birth, I\u2019d say YTA to OP. It\u2019s almost along the lines of shock, going through trauma, and not being in your right mind for a bit there, and then the physical trauma on top of that. I think that\u2019s valid, and feel it would be understandable for her to get herself together a little bit physically and emotionally before sharing news. \n\nBUT it doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s the issue in this situation. It sounds like her hang up was the social media picture. She wanted the perfect picture\u2026not \u201chey, I feel like death and I need a hot minute to recover\u201d, or even having  a serious complication afterward that needed to be prioritized medically. To me it seems she is using the \u201cI had to go through all this\u201d as a manipulation to rationalize the crazy social media thing and wanting to assert her control. It\u2019s definitely extreme and bizarre. \n\nAlso, no one going through legit trauma is worried about a social media post and picture. You\u2019re typically terrified and shocked at what you just went through, processing some very basic, instinct-level emotions (fear, panic, anger, sadness, pain), NOT thinking along the lines of social media. \nIt also sounds like she is trying to guilt OP in order to make him feel his behavior is wrong, and excuse her crappy behavior. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how anyone\u2019s first thought after going through a traumatic even is \u201cpoor me\u201d and \u201cyou have to do what I say because I had to go through all that\u201d and \u201cwell our picture for social media must be perfect\u201d. It\u2019s just manipulative. I was soooo happy my son was ok after he was born and so happy I survived lol, I honestly didn\u2019t give a shit what the pics were like, what he was wearing, how ugly or gross or sloppy out pictures looked.", "Holy f....\n\nI hadn't seen that and it moves me from a bit of a N A H leaning towards a huge YTA, OP!", "HOLY freaking heck, I already thought OP was an AH because he was only thinking about his mother during AND after the procedure, but this, THIS just makes him more of an AH. He really couldn't think about how painful that would be... Poor wife, she had to go through all that basically alone while her only support was nagging her all time about if he could pleeeease tell his mother.", "This is my thought, too. Close family and friends get a text; your instagram world can get the post several days/a week later, lol.", "The second you tell one person, they tell everyone. Then they start showing up, calling, texting, etc. That \"perfect photo\" was an excuse to delay all of that while she recovered. Experienced moms know you don't announce a birth until you're ready for visitors, because they're coming to see the baby whether you want them to or not. Especially Grandma who always sends to think it's \"her right\".\n\nOP's mom immediately blabbed to the group chat. That's the norm, not an exception.", "OP himself is the reason he had to \"lie\" though. He \"forgot\" his agreement with his wife and sent a stupid text that he then had to delete. HE started this whole mess. He told his mom everything was fine and that he couldn't talk, and she continued blowing up his phone. All of that is on him.", "Idk man, needing to text mummy dearest during these first moments as a family is off to me too- especially because the mom took it upon herself to text the rest of the family. Do we think this is the first time his family/mom has taken matters that should be controlled by him and his wife into their own hands? I really think this was a control thing, and with how horribly traumatic the birth was (feeling herself being literally cut open) I think it\u2019s reasonable to want a breathing period to recuperate just mom and dad and baby in a bubble of peace.", "So not telling his mom about likely the biggest event in his life for a full day is not a compromise?", "I half regretted telling some of the people I did, honestly. My MIL was absolutely off the rails hounding us. Especially after baby went to the NICU. It made everything so much harder. I was glad that certain family members knew and were watching their phones, so we had support after she was rushed to the NICU, but some of it was just overwhelming.\n\nIf we were having more kids, MIL and FIL wouldn't know until after the birth. Some people just cause too much extra stress with the way they communicate things and the frequency of those texts/calls.", "True, but that's not what I was commenting on, was it? I was very specifically responding to a comment implying making grandparents wait at all to learn about the birth of their grandchild is horrible. It's not horrible and I gave context for why and some things the wife might have been feeling.\n\nAnd beyond that, it doesn't matter how badly OP wanted to text his mom because he had made an agreement with his wife. He broke that agreement and caused a massive shitstorm of his own making, with his mother harassing and guilt tripping him.\n\nHis mother's whining is not the priority here. His wife, who almost died, should have been the priority. Making sure she was okay, physically and mentally, should have been his priority. Rushing her to announce asap after he agreed to let her have her pictures makes him a massive AH, considering everything that happened. She felt herself get cut open. She deserves a few hours to rest before announcing it.\n\nYTA for sure.", "No, it's really not.\n\nThey both involve a C-section (physical pain, fatigue, restrictions), trauma (OP's wife literally felt herself get cut open), and a loss of control (OP's wife did not want a C-section). From the sounds of it, OP's wife and child almost died. My daughter almost died. We were both looking forward to take specific announcement photos, and that immediate moment was stolen from both of us due to traumatic circumstances.\n\nThey are not the same story, but they are absolutely similar enough that I can empathize with his wife and understand quite a few reasons the photo may have been so important to her.\n\nShe had a much more difficult birth and will face a harder recovery than I did. Of course she needs time to rest, to process, to be alone with her family, whatever it is that she was needing while waiting to feel up to getting the photo that was clearly very important to her.", "That's the fault of OP for thinking of his mother first and sending her worrying, cryptic texts. She never should have gotten a text in the first place, per OP's agreement with his wife.", "And his mom promptly tried to inform the whole family. OPs wife's feelings were more important here ave if op wasn't a bumbling idiot, his mom wouldn't have been worried. How hard is it to communicate \"wife's fine, everything's fine, call you in the morning, love you\". Like really? \n\nSure, op was excited to announce the birth, but his wife was obviously exhausted and not even able to get out of bed yet, he should have respected her wishes.", "No, it's not. See my other comment. They're actually quite similar if you read OP's comments detailing just how traumatic the birth was.", "Except grandma *immediately* announced it in the family group chat. Just like they knew she would. She deleted it, but what I\u2019d everyone had seen it? If he told her earlier in the night when the baby was born I\u2019m sure more people would have seen it. It sounds like grandma has the main character energy and wife is done indulging her.", "OPs wife sounds a little\u2026over the top.

Refusing to tell anyone until you have staged a photo shoot is **not**", "Bingo as soon as I read about the board I knew this was curated content", "I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right or justified, but I can absolutely see a very hormonal post-partum woman who just went through a major surgery she explicitly didn\u2019t want due to complications maybe wanting to have some sort of semblance of control over a situation very much out of her control.\n\nIt\u2019s not \u201cmain character energy\u201d, it\u2019s a trauma response.", "instagram moms are a different breed. esh and neither of the parents seem to care about the actual baby itself", "It\u2019s not even like it was a week of lying, it was literally a day.

Is it that hard to let her rest until morning so she can be a part of the announcements? OP did it at 11pm then 2am! His wife was likely trying to rest.

Or maybe just turn off the bloody phone. His mother immediately announced to everyone when all the wife wanted was to send a nice picture to everyone when she felt more up to it.", "Absolutely!!!  It\u2019s his child too\u2026", "Same here and after all that struggle and a c section I just wanted everyone to know he was here and healthy. Waiting for photo op pics is a little crazy.

Why are you arguing that the comparison is apples to apples?", "I\u2019m more saying that the trauma of having your child stop breathing in your arms and be taken from you to NICU where you weren\u2019t able to see them for 8 hours is objectively terrifying. In that situation, I find it completely reasonable to hold onto the information you share because at that point you still don\u2019t know if your baby will be ok. You wanting to wait until you knew baby was ok is 100% justifiable and relatable and tragic. OPs wife wanting to wait for the lighting to be right with her, by all accounts, healthy baby is just a different situation. \n\nFor the record, I think OP was wrong for secretly telling his mom after agreeing to a plan with his wife. I think OP and his wife were both just being a little extra - which is understandable they\u2019re stressed and tired and wife had her abdomen ripped apart. I think OPs situation is about poor communication between a couple who is exhausted and not really able to see their partner\u2019s point of view.  That\u2019s entirely different from the medical trauma underpinning your experience. I am sorry your birth experience was so scary.", "Couldn\u2019t agree more. When I was giving birth to my first, I told my dad and mom, but my phone was dying. So I said we\u2019d tell everyone once our phone were charged.

I also just had a premature baby hours before. Just be like that nurse and let moms be a little crazy, okay? \n\nLet her have her peace and her moment. Let her have some sense of control over something. Why do we feel we must rush to new mothers and are owed an immediate announcement?

How do you feel when you are lied to? How do you feel when your son or daughter lie to you intentionally?\n\nYes, his wife deserves support. He too deserves support. He just became a Dad.

I'm a mom x3 and a grandma x 5. Having a baby is important to the whole family and childbirth is dangerous for both mom and baby. Everyone who cares about the family waits and worries and hopes and prays for their health. They experienced a delivery that was scary and potentially life threatening. Telling people who love you via text that you are all well seems like the very least you could do. And dad needed the support of his family. Unless family is otherwise harmful to your health and happiness, there's no reason to withhold information.

Her birth plan did not include a C-section. She had likely spent the last 9 months envisioning n her mind how the birth would go, only for all of that to be thrown out the window.

Plus OP's wife may be using \"the right pic\" as an excuse not to communicate with the outside world atm because she just had what is presumably a traumatic birth experience where she had to have her gut cut open and shit taken out, likely including intestines, while numbed but still awake.

I don't loathe his mom, I think op is TA and sucks because he made an agreement with his wife and couldn't stick with it and almost took the one thing from her that she still had control over.

I don\u2019t understand people like that. It really sounds like this was the one part of her pregnancy she wanted to control, and the one part of it she didn\u2019t want her mother in law involved in. So what does mom do? She yells at her kid for keeping her in the dark for a couple of hours (I think we can all tell she wasn\u2019t worried about anybody\u2019s safety or health given her actions) then retaliates against them for having the audacity to live their lives without her for half a day.", "It\u2019s not her place.

There is a point where new mommas can go to far, this is it for me. She got to bond with baby for nine months and now he wants to share in that excitement. Now it might be because I was pregnant in the beginning days of Covid and my husband never got to attend any of the doctors appointments due to restrictions, but he missed so much because he had to see everything through a phone while sitting in the car. To finally see and be the one to share things meant the world to him. He didn\u2019t get to share everything as the office had crap signal depending on what room I was placed it.

You\u2019re basically ignoring that he had health needs because his mom isn\u2019t a saint.", "I\u2019ve had 4 kids.  Including hyperemesis for every damned day of each pregnancy.  That means I barfed multiple times every single day for a total of 3 years, when you add it up. \n\nHe has a right to call his mom.", "So according to you he\u2019s not supposed to have support ??? Yikes", "Holy fuck, are you missing the point. The man just watched his wife go through a major surgery where things went wrong. And he had zero support from anyone for the sake of a photo op.", "Is OP the nurse in charge of bag change? Is he running fluids from pharmacy to her? The new mother is tired, she's being taken care of, and probably sleeping. I think dad can have a moment to text his mother ffs.", "She was asleep.\n\nI\u2019ve had 4 kids.  I wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of telling him he had no right to talk to his mother.    NTA", "Guess you\u2019ve never had a partner go through surgery where something went wrong. Consider yourself fuckin lucky", "We ended up in the hospital a week later as my wife developed post-partum pre-eclampsia. I was absolutely useless as a partner as I was so utterly exhausted and unsure of what to do. I just remember about 1am trying to swaddle a crying baby in the hopes of maybe he\u2019d go to sleep and failing miserable until a nurse took over and I remember nothing after that except waking up in the morning as I guess I somehow made it to the couch. I\u2019m pretty sure I was crying and mumbling something about how exhausted I was. \n\nThat\u2019s part of why this dad should just be a support robot pisses me off so much. Like, trying to be that got me to the point where I literally couldn\u2019t function.", "They hadn't agreed a time. He assumed a few hours after the birth. But his wife was resting so he couldnt talk to her. And he couldnt talk to anyone else about it. Thats hard.", "Yeah. Honestly, I feel this incident highlights a much larger issue where OP needs to stop catering to his Mum and letting her control and dictate his life. \nI also suspect his wife was expecting to be up for the photo much earlier if her birth had been easier. And I\u2019m torn between understanding her desire for control, and thinking a compromise with an announcement with minimum details aside from people are well, with photos to come, is not a big ask. (Though I suspect OP would not be much on compromise either, and should have his phone taken away)", "Because those are such different timescales?", "Are serious? She\u2019s still in the hospital. Do you understand that she had major extremely painful surgery. They kick her out of the hospital after a couple of days. But that\u2019s an unreasonable amount of time to\nNot blast the news.\n\nThis sub gets more and more children commenting every day", "Personally, they never gave my husband a muzzle at the hospital so I\u2019m not quite sure what your point there is.", "This is the attitude that gets nurses to remove dads from the birthing room. Good luck with that!", "Yeah but he admits in his follow up comment that he should\u2019ve  reassured his mom and made her less worried, but his texts were worryingly vague and shit. I think a simple \u201ceverything is good, we will talk tomorrow\u201d would have solved this entire situation but he kinda let that shit escalate PLUS he sent the first message and deleted it which started his moms pestering in the first place. He agreed to his wife that they would wait to announce the birth until she took specific pictures, he broke that and then escalated the situation by admittedly sending worryingly worded texts, so I think he\u2019s (minorly) the asshole", "Exactly.  I would have been a wreck if my son had said they weren't announcing anything until the next day.  I would have been convinced there was something terrible wrong with the baby.   It is a very cruel not to make the announcement right away.   It amazes me that anyone  would try to do something like delay an announcement to grandparents and close relatives. \n\nWas OPs wife worrying about getting cred on social media?", "The wife wasn\u2019t even in the recovery room until 12am. I agree he needed support but honestly his needs at that point didn\u2019t come first. It wasn\u2019t about the picture. He argued with his fresh out of surgery wife (and mother of his child) because his mother was nagging him. All she wanted was to wait until she felt a bit better and get some rest so she could take a cute picture of the child that was just cut out from her.\n\nGrandma dearest just wanted to make the announcement for herself and be \u2018the first to know\u2019. She had 0 respect for the wife\u2019s recovery.\n\nYou obviously disagree but in that moment husband should\u2019ve put his own needs aside. Yes he\u2019d seen his wife go through something horrible. But his wife actually went through the something horrible. I\u2019m not dismissing that it was hard for him - but it was harder for her. And to wake up from all of that - not even in recovery yet and just have your husband nag to announce when you weren\u2019t ready. \n\nJust because the baby had been born, didn\u2019t mean his job supporting her was over. She wanted a tiny semblance of control and to be a part of her own child\u2019s birth announcement, and instead he argued with her because \u2018he didn\u2019t want to lie to mommy\u2019. \n\nPoor woman.", "That\u2019s you personally. His wife had asked to hold off and he agreed. Sounded like the right call too considering she immediately told everybody. And he\u2019d already told her everything was fine.\n\nAnd I appreciate that hyperemesis must be absolute hell. But she probably just wanted to rest before sharing the news & being part of the announcement. I know I needed rest before telling everyone because I wanted to share in the joy. \n\nHe did a very poor job of respecting his wife\u2019s needs in that moment.", "What support? Grandma just wanted the announcement all for herself and monopolised his time that he should\u2019ve been spending with his family. \n\nIf his wife can go through what she did, he can wait a little before announcing. Grandma could\u2019ve respected his \u2018everything\u2019s fine I\u2019ll talk tomorrow\u2019.\n\nInstead OP just stressed out his wife.", "But his mother didn\u2019t support him - she kept nagging him. He could\u2019ve just rested with his wife, phone off and then enjoyed telling everyone in the morning together. Instead his own mother filled the entire time with stress because she couldn\u2019t respect an \u2018everything\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll talk tomorrow\u2019.\n\nHis wife is the one who went *through* the major surgery. All was fine for OP at this point, the danger had passed. His wife has the difficult job of recovering from major surgery and she wanted one little thing from him.", "You can pretty much tell who here in this thread hasn\u2019t had a kid. Their misconception of what it\u2019s like afterwards is the most stereotypical nonsense.", "Don\u2019t forget about \u201cThe bad lighting\u201d.", "She was probably just exhausted and wanted to be a part of the announcement herself. The whole picture thing was likely her way of saying \u2018not now\u2019 and OP has focused way too much on that. \n\nBaby was born at 4pm and she woke up hours later (after a long labour too). The woman was likely exhausted and just wanted to be able to share the joy.\n\nNot to mention grandma immediately shared it\u2026 bet OP\u2019s wife saw that coming a mile away but was too tired to articulate and argue that. So she used the picture thing assuming that husband would support her considering he\u2019d agreed to announcing like that.", "I\u2019m a grown adult actually. And I was being overdramatic I admit. I just don\u2019t get the big deal behind letting everyone know mom and baby are okay and then doing the official announcement later.", "I suspect he somewhat panicked when the birth became traumatic and he was faced with potentially losing wife and baby. I doubt he was very conscious or careful of his texts when things were so crazy. I\u2019m just guessing and I\u2019m a woman, but I think we focus on the woman so much that we forget how scary it might be for the husband to be witnessing while being completely helpless when things hit the fan. I\u2019m just assuming none of what he did was malicious, but more just dumb and maybe desperate.", "And, he never should have agreed. But he did, because nobody bothered to let any of them know what a stupid idea denying the partner emotional support is because our discourse is so centered on the mother to the point of forgetting there\u2019s another person involved. \n\nIt was absolutely the wrong call. Maybe somebody other than his mother, but he absolutely needed to be able to talk to somebody.", "And maybe she would have if he was allowed to talk to her about what just happened. But he wasn\u2019t. He could talk to ANYONE. Not his mom, any siblings, friends, etc. \n\nAnd his wife isn\u2019t the only one who went through something. Who knows what he was feeling in the storm of emotions. But he couldn\u2019t say a word to anyone for the sake of a goddamn picture. People need to stop worrying about unimportant shit like perfect pictures and worry about the people that shit hurts. What the fuck is wrong with people?", "You need to interact with more people irl because this a perspective of someone who isn\u2019t around many people.", "Because she wants a couple of days to learn how to go use the bathroom without crying in pain and get to meet the child she just spent ten months suffering to bring into the world? \n\nThe grandmother immediately blasted the group chat right after being told not to say anything. It is clear, by her own doting son\u2019s account no less, that she does not respect boundaries and since OP also didn\u2019t stick to the agreement not respecting wife\u2019s boundaries sounds like a common theme in his family. \n\nNot everyone wants a gaggle of family in the hospital after giving birth, especially if surgery is involved. I imagine after a rough pregnancy even less.\n\nCannot believe people think a woman who is not ready to open the gates to boundary stomping in-laws is somehow dramatic or controlling."]}
