She had hyperemesis which means she had been vomiting daily along with having heartburn. The day her water broke, she tells me that she does not want to announce the birth to anyone until she takes specific pictures. I agree.\r  \n\r  \nIt's the due date and my wife goes into labor but I dismiss everyone trying to contact me. My wife gets stuck in 7 cm dilation and has to get a c-section which she did not want. \r  \n\r  \nIt was quite a journey. But nonetheless, my daughter was born a healthy baby and holding her in my arms was a spiritual experience to me. I was so in the moment that I thought of my mom who lost her youngest son (my brother) last year and then sent her texts announcing the birth. I then remembered I can't announce it yet and deleted it before she could see. \r  \n\r  \nFew hours later, my wife wakes up and  I ask if we can announce. She says no, we have to get her in a specific outfit and with a board showing her weight, birth and name. We set this up but she doesn't want to take the picture because she's too tired.  I'm like fine.\r  \n\r  \nAt this point, for hours now, I've been dismissing my mom because she saw the missing calls and deleted texts and knows we're in the hospital. She is worried sick and I tell her 'it's nothing, I cant talk to you right now'. \rIt hits 11:30 PM,  about to be the next day and Ive been lying as if my daughter wasnt just born. I don't like lying so I am getting very uncomftorable.\r  \n\r  \nIt hits 12 and we get to the post partem room and I ask can we take the pic and announce now and she says no, it's too dark for a photo. She says we will wait til the morning. My mom is worried sick and texting me constantly and not going to sleep until I tell her what's going on.\r  \n\r  \nSo we argue about this for a bit and I'm telling her I understand you went through hell and I've been with you every step of the way. But this was a very emotional moment for me too and I really would have loved to share it with the person that brought me into this world. I waited all day for this picture and to then be told not to take it because of lighting is a bit much.. especially after having to lie about my daughters birth when lying is so out of character for me.   \n\r  \nI would have never agreed to these terms if I knew it would be to announce the next day. She then tells me its not about me and my emotions dont matter. My mom does not take precedence over her, especially after all that she went through. She cries and tells me how horrible I am for even arguing about this after her c section. \r  \n\r  \nI couldn't keep up with the lie and ended up texting my mom a few hours later (2 AM) that my daughter was born. But I told her I wouldnt send pics til morning. She scolded me for lying to her when the baby had been born hours ago and found me to be so cruel for that. Nonetheless, she announced in the family group chat that she is a grandmother but then deleted it right away after I told her (noone saw since it was so late).\r  \n\r\r  \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1688431842, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14q09yr/aita_for_announcing_birth_to_mother_after_wifes/", "score": 200, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She needed to regain control of a situation that went out of control. She needed to take a breath and process the surgery she just had. She needed to focus on the baby and herself. \n\nI get that you wanted to share the exciting news but she really needed you there.", "YTA\n\nHow hard would it have been to say \"Everyone is fine and safe.  We're exhausted and I'm turning off my phone.  Details coming tomorrow. \"\n\nYour mom literally tried to announce it to the family.   Don't you think there is a reason that your wife didn't want her to know immediately?  \n\nGet your head out of your mom's ass and start being there for your wife and kid.  They should be your #1 priority.", "So you were handed your new baby and your first thought was about your mother.\n\nYour wife woke up after a traumatic major medical procedure and, again, your first thought was about your mother.\n\nYour mother hounded you for *twelve hours* over a deleted text.\n\nYour mother scolded and guilt tripped you, a whole ass adult, for not immediately telling her something that was none of her business.\n\nYour mother then took it upon herself to announce news that was not hers to share.\n\nAre we seeing a problem here? It doesn't matter *how* your wife wanted to announce the birth of her child, it was her announcement to make, with you, as a family. Telling people you've  just had a baby comes with a lot of people then bothering you about the baby. She deserved time to recover and spend time alone with her husband and daughter until she was ready to take on that social obligation. And that's all it is - a social obligation - no one else is entitled to this information", "YTA. You say in a comment that your wife had an emergency c-section, the anesthesia failed, and she felt the herself get cut open. Why in the world where you even thinking of your mother's feelings during this time!? And then to argue with your wife and end up telling your mother anyways... yikes. I hope your wife has family or friends close by who can be a real support to her, because it looks like you're failing her miserably", "YTA\n\nYour wife likely delayed because she was under a shitload of stress and pain and a gazillion things to manage. Having a C-section is not a party. \n\nYour wife lost control of pretty much everything in her life the last few months and during labor. You do realize that if she did not have a C-section, your wife and your child would be dead, right? That\u2019s how dangerous her labor was. \n\nThis was the one thing she could control, and you took that away from her.", "YTA. Sorry, but your mom does not tump your wife, especially when wife just had a traumatic c-section. There\u2019s a big difference between \u201cit\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t talk to you now\u201d and \u201ceveryone is okay, I\u2019ll call you tomorrow.\u201d \n\nI guess I just can\u2019t relate to your position. When I was pregnant, I heard and read horror stories about husbands being completely consumed and utterly distracted by their families and cell phones. I told my husband that I didn\u2019t want either of our families to know when I went into labor. I didn\u2019t want any of them to worry and I didn\u2019t want him constantly trying to update people (although in retrospect, both my mother and his parents would have handled it just fine and no one would have created any drama). He agreed and honored our agreement. Once baby arrived, he called his side and I called mine. Easy peasy.", "YTA, that is your wife and at the time she wanted peace and quiet due to everything she went through, I get you wanted to be proud of your daughter coming into this world but when in that room it's all about her and the baby.", "Yes. YTA. It\u2019s not about your mother. You are an adult, and your mother still gets to scold you and guilt you? You are \u201ccruel\u201d for not telling her soon enough? That is not what \u201ccruel\u201d means. You told her the news your wife wasn\u2019t ready to share, and the first thing she did was announce it to the whole family? Even if she backtracked, that\u2019s probably at least part of the reason your wife didn\u2019t want to share except on her terms. You need to work on your guilt about your mother and her power over you, or your wife is going to have a big problem with her role in your lives.", "YTA. Regardless of my opinion on needing the perfect picture to announce, you shouldn\u2019t have told her knowing she wasn\u2019t on board. It was a matter of hours, not days and choosing to prioritize your mom over your wife who had just gone through surgery bringing life into the world was the wrong call \n\nAnd based on the group chat situation, maybe part of the reason your wife didn\u2019t want your mom to know until she was \u201cready\u201d with the right picture to post it to social media is because she knew your mom would start spreading it around", "YTA\n\nFor agreeing to something then going behind her back. For the initial text to your mom that set this whole thing off. For stoking your mom\u2019s concern - you could have texted your mom \u201cWe\u2019re all okay but need some time, I\u2019ll update you tomorrow\u201d. You could have texted her any number of things better than \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I can\u2019t talk right now\u201d. For the first question you asked your wife when she woke from a sleep post-birth being about announcing rather than how she\u2019s feeling, and for being annoyed that she\u2019s tired. For arguing with her. Also for presenting this as if you\u2019d been waiting FOREVER when you texted your mom within two hours of getting to the post partum room.\n\nYour mom is also an AH for continuing to hassle you when she knew you couldn\u2019t talk, for scolding you instead of for sharing joy, for calling you cruel, and for announcing the news in the family group chat. She shouldn\u2019t get a free pass with \u201cnoone saw since it was so late\u201d. It was not her announcement to make. I can see why your wife didn\u2019t want you to tell her before she was ready to share.", "YTA. You do not know the hell some of us went through to grow and deliver our children. There is nothing wrong with her wanting to wait until she is rested to take a nice photo with her child. There is nothing wrong with her wanting a nice photo in the first place. For almost all of us, we are exhausted from sharing our uncomfortably changing bodies for 10 months and our bodies take just as long if not longer to recover, if ever. You could have said \u201cwe are fine, talk tomorrow.\u201d She made a simple request and you agreed until it didn\u2019t suit you, then you argued with your postpartum wife mere hours after she woke up from a major, childbearing surgery. You\u2019re a piece of work.", "YTA.  Please explain how your mother takes precedence over your wife here.", "Thanks to everyone who gave me honest answers. I needed outside perspective. I agree that I was an asshole in this situation. For one, I made the mistake of texting my mother about 2 hours after the birth. Even if I deleted the text, I started the domino effect of all that occurred and made things worse with every correction. \n\nSure, I was overwhelmed with emotion but I could have thought about what my wife went through in that moment and not succumbed to texting my mom. I know the loss of her son/my brother is still fresh but this is my daughter/wife/me moment and no one else should take any sort of precedence over that. \n\n\rDespite me deleting the texts, I could have much better communicated with my mother and let her know everything is fine and that we will speak tomorrow.  My texts were the kind of texts that would make people worry sick. I handled that poorly. \n\n\rAnd sure, I felt bamboozled over getting the opportunity to take the picture she wanted a number of times but getting rejected for it until finally, getting it delayed to the next day. I personally don\u2019t think the \u2018right\u2019 photo is more important than the moment itself. But that\u2019s just my opinion and if I agreed to something then I ought to stick to my word.  \n\n\rAnd to argue with my wife over that in such a vulnerable moment is what inevitably makes me an asshole. She just went through a traumatic birth and this should not have been a topic of discussion. It wasn\u2019t an argument at first, as it was more of me asking but I did get argumentative the moment she told me my emotions don\u2019t matter right now. I will still say I believe that to be wrong because it was my daughters birth as well and at the very least, my emotions should be considered.\n\n\rNonetheless, my mother knowing if the baby is all right was not more important than my wife being at peace. My mother being anxious was not my wifes fault. It was mine and I should have worked on resolving that on my own with better communication. \n\n\rI think me justifying my actions and believing me not to be the asshole comes from a place of me believing my intentions were good and that I tried to do the right thing in this situation. But intentions don\u2019t so much as matter as of how our actions make people feel. And my actions both made my wife and my mother feel like shit so inevitably, I am the asshole. I will apologize and again, thank you all for your honesty.", "You just showed your wife that you will always prioritize your mother over her.\n\nGood luck with that.\n\nYTA", "Your mom sent you on a guilt trip, for sure. I\u2019m guessing that is exactly why your wife wanted you to wait to tell your parents\u2026..\n\nYTA", "YTA. Your wife made a request and you agreed. Then you went behind her back, minutes after her c section, changed your mind and made your mom worried sick. Instead of apologizing to your wife, you start to argue, again right after she gave birth and is probably a total mess from this experience. \n\nI understand you wanted to share with your mom, but you should not have agreed on the announcement.", "YTA - especially since she IMMEDIATELY texted the group chat. Only reason no one saw it was because it was at 2am. \n\nThis is not about your mother, it\u2019s about your wife that was just cut open to give birth to your child.", "Eh I will say ESH. \n\nYou\u2019re wife for worrying more about a suitable social media post instead of letting family and friends know that she and baby were both healthy and ok. Also for saying you\u2019re feelings don\u2019t matter. \n\nYou\u2019re mom for trying to announce it to the family instead of keeping it quiet like you asked. \n\nAnd you for going back on what you agreed to. Though you suck the absolute least in this situation.  Still ended up being a shitty situation. \n\nIt should have been a no brainer to let immediate loved ones know that both baby and mom were ok while still giving no other details until new mom was ready to post pictures.", "YTA, sorry but your feelings don't matter in that moment. You will be an equal parent to your kid (assuming that's what you want) but you aren't on the day your wife is giving birth. If there is ever a time that anyone is allowed to be unreasonable, it's during and immediately after labour.\n\nYour mother's first instinct was to share the news without asking permission, proving your wife was right to delay until ready to announce more widely.\n\n(p.s. congratulations)", "Wow so rather than been in the moment with your new daughter and wife who was put out to it for delivery. You gotta get that text out to your mother and she has to announce she\u2019s a grandma\n\nYour mother need to know she\u2019s not a priority wtf telling you failed  as a son\n\nYou wife may of just wanted bonding time your new daughter and you  she has just been through a very traumatic birth", "NTA - maybe ill get downvoted to hell for this \n\nBut i think your wife was being unreasonable for this. Clearly she just went through a massively traumatic experience, but insisting on a specific outfit and photo to merely tell someone your daughter was born is a little ridiculous. Its not like you were posting pics of the newbown all over the internet, you just wanted to let your family know she was born.", "What\u2019s done is done. This seems like an overall horrible situation. I don\u2019t know how I would of acted in either of you or your wife\u2019s situations and I can empathize with both of you. I would absolutely want to tell my family everything is ok but I can also understand your wife just needing this one thing to feel in control again. To me, the only AH is your mom for calling you cruel. That was unnecessary in an already stressful situation and served no purpose other than make you feel guilty. Congratulations, I hope your wife\u2019s recovery is going well and that you will be over to get over this quickly and focus on your daughter!", "NTA.

Giving birth is no excuse for that.", "NTA-your wife's feelings are valid as are yours.  But, her actions were unreasonable.  If there is missing info that maybe your wife was expecting your mother to overstep boundaries,  show up, and make the birth all about Grandma, I will change my vote.

If her rationale is just getting the perfect picture before the announcement goes out, oh Honey, you are in for a lifetime of narcissistic behaviors here.", "NTA. Yes, OP agreed to something that sounded reasonable on paper but it was no longer reasonable as his wife continued to move the goal posts. Then she disregarded his feelings about the matter entirely.

Honestly, I think focusing on getting the \u201cperfect picture\u201d with the perfect outfit and the perfect lighting is not the most important thing. I understand wanting to wait due to medical reasons, but because of photos? \nI feel bad for your mom, who probably was terrified something bad happened to her grand bay. \nI\u2019m a new mother who has a c section two months ago and I get how hard it is. But I also made sure that select family were kept in the loop; it can be so hard for them as well.

But that doesn't mean she can dismiss your emotions. Your emotions regarding your own baby should matter and that mindset is not healthy for her to have. I can understand why she would want space after birth and allowed time but she should at least not have you be in a position where you have to ghost your own mother.\n\nYour mother is already aware your wife went into labor, so it's not irrational for her to worry with the lack of contact. However, you should have communicated better to her that some space is wanted during this time. You could have told her everything is fine and the both of you need some time without directly going against your wife's wishes. \n\nAnd I think your mother is being a bit of an asshole by focusing on the idea of being a grandmother and the need to announce it, it makes it seem like that's all she cared about and not the wellbeing of you and your wife.", "ESH\n\nMy kids were all born before social media so I\u2019m not exactly sure of the \u201cannouncement picture etiquette\u201d but I find it ridiculous that family cannot know that mom & baby are fine & healthy before the \u201cspecific pictures\u201d are taken.

She had hyperemesis which means she had been vomiting daily along with having heartburn. The day her water broke, she tells me that she does not want to announce the birth to anyone until she takes specific pictures. I agree.\r  \n\r  \nIt's the due date and my wife goes into labor but I dismiss everyone trying to contact me. My wife gets stuck in 7 cm dilation and has to get a c-section which she did not want. \r  \n\r  \nIt was quite a journey. But nonetheless, my daughter was born a healthy baby and holding her in my arms was a spiritual experience to me. I was so in the moment that I thought of my mom who lost her youngest son (my brother) last year and then sent her texts announcing the birth. I then remembered I can't announce it yet and deleted it before she could see. \r  \n\r  \nFew hours later, my wife wakes up and  I ask if we can announce. She says no, we have to get her in a specific outfit and with a board showing her weight, birth and name. We set this up but she doesn't want to take the picture because she's too tired.  I'm like fine.\r  \n\r  \nAt this point, for hours now, I've been dismissing my mom because she saw the missing calls and deleted texts and knows we're in the hospital. She is worried sick and I tell her 'it's nothing, I cant talk to you right now'. \rIt hits 11:30 PM,  about to be the next day and Ive been lying as if my daughter wasnt just born. I don't like lying so I am getting very uncomftorable.\r  \n\r  \nIt hits 12 and we get to the post partem room and I ask can we take the pic and announce now and she says no, it's too dark for a photo. She says we will wait til the morning. My mom is worried sick and texting me constantly and not going to sleep until I tell her what's going on.\r  \n\r  \nSo we argue about this for a bit and I'm telling her I understand you went through hell and I've been with you every step of the way. But this was a very emotional moment for me too and I really would have loved to share it with the person that brought me into this world. I waited all day for this picture and to then be told not to take it because of lighting is a bit much.. especially after having to lie about my daughters birth when lying is so out of character for me.   \n\r  \nI would have never agreed to these terms if I knew it would be to announce the next day. She then tells me its not about me and my emotions dont matter. My mom does not take precedence over her, especially after all that she went through. She cries and tells me how horrible I am for even arguing about this after her c section. \r  \n\r  \nI couldn't keep up with the lie and ended up texting my mom a few hours later (2 AM) that my daughter was born. But I told her I wouldnt send pics til morning. She scolded me for lying to her when the baby had been born hours ago and found me to be so cruel for that. Nonetheless, she announced in the family group chat that she is a grandmother but then deleted it right away after I told her (noone saw since it was so late).\r  \n\r\r  \nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
