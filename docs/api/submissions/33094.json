You've already said your piece - you also back off at an appropriate time and in an appropriate way.  The kids shouldn't have tried to get you in the middle of they and your parents, and there'd be zero winning if you tried.  You aren't in any position to 'put your foot down'.

You and Lily really should\u2019ve discussed and formulated a plan first - independent of the kids as it should\u2019ve been clear some feelings would be hurt.\n\nSince you\u2019ve know Lily forever, definitely take some time to talk it through with her. Maybe come up with alternatives - like take all the kids as well as Dave. Dave and his kids could more or less go off on their own and you and Lily\u2019s kids do your own thing.

And in 5 years Lily will be lamenting about why her children don't want anything to do with her and her new family.

When you\u2019re dealing with older children, they might be out of the house before any bonding can really happen. \n\nLily and Dave are their parents so you cannot usurp them, even if the kids want you on their side and you want to be on their side. This isn\u2019t a situation of abuse or neglect. If you were legitimately the aunt of Lily\u2018s children you would be expected to extend your love and attention to Dave\u2019s children, too.  \n\nTo be fair, in any situation? You don\u2019t have to do it. You can reach the compromise that you reached where you don\u2019t do it at all anymore and they can use it as a bonding exercise with their family. \n\nIt definitely sucks for them, and for you. \n\nI would suggest that in replacement you do a specific birthday thing with each of the children. So that you still get your one on one time but you don\u2019t become a wedge between your best friend, and her future husband, or a tool that her children can use against their future stepdad. \n\nIf it were me (as long as I didn\u2019t have a problem with Dave, and the way that he raised his children) I would advocate that Lily\u2019s children give David a chance and give those kids a chance because it\u2019s not their fault either. There definitely could be a lot of additional drama that you did not get into: behaviour problems and unreasonable expectations are to be expected with children going through this type of change - but none of those things are your responsibility to solve. Keep the lines of communication open with Lily\u2019s children, and if something is very questionable, they will tell you and you can go from  there.

Did you force your friend to create a blended family with kids who don't get along?  You're done apologizing. There's nothing you can do to force Lily into speaking up for herself.  If you doubled down with Dave, he would just be madder at you while Lily would still do nothing about it.  Just tell her to enjoy the markets, make the best of it with Dave and all the children, and you're happy to plan something different with her and her kids down the road.  NTA.", "NTA. It was Lily's job to set him straight but she took his side and you put your foot down. No way should he stick his kids with yours and ruin your holiday. Let Lily and Dave establish their own family traditions if they must but don't take on more kids than you want to.", "NTA. You have a tradition that\u2019s been in place for a few years now. Additionally, it would be a different dynamic bringing younger kids, especially ones that are poorly behaved. It\u2019s not your job to undermine your friend\u2019s parenting. I think suggesting they go as a family was the right thing, however it does seem like Lily has rose coloured glasses on in terms of the blended family, so I think it would be good if you could help advocate for the older kids away from Dave.", "Nta 'I'm not ever going to take Saffy bc she runs away when she doesn't ger her way and it's not safe'.", "NTA.  I don\u2019t know if putting your foot down is a good idea.  I would leave it alone.  They are the parents and they are the decision makers.  They could easily do something else with the two kids while you take Lily\u2019s kids, but alas they\u2019re too adverse to compromise.", "NTA.  It's not your place to make decisions about their family dynamic.  It sounds like the younger kids need some discipline & the older kids need some compassion and maturity.  Just be glad you don't have to deal with them 24/7.", "NTA.  You have NO relationship with those kids, this is an annual tradition for you with the kids, and managing 5 kids alone would be very difficult.  They should do something as a family but asking you to take the other kids was over the top.", "This is where you need to take a step back and let your friend handle the situation with her kids/husband. It\u2019s super hard to blend families as lots of emotions are involved. They\u2019re still new in this game as well. Definitely not your place to state your opinion to the kids! They need to speak with their mother", "ESH. Though honestly you really aren't much of an asshole here because you are caught in a weird situation. But you should have spoken up. The critical point is that you have known her kids their entire lives. Just because you have a tradition with them, doesn't mean you have to take on two kids you don't even know. What sort of people expect you to take two extra children you don't know with you? That's ridiculous. What you should have said was that you aren't comfortable with suck a large group of children, especially since you don't know two of them at all, and that you look forward to getting acquainted so that in the future so that you can include them. If I were you I'd take Lily aside and tell her this, tell her you're disappointed that you have to give up this tradition you've had with her kids and feel pretty sad and hurt that you can't continue that tradition with them. \n\nThe second thing I'd start doing, though I'd wait a little bit, is to gently point out that blending the families isn't just going to happen and that by taking away these sorts of special moments or forcing the kids to share them is a recipe for future estrangement. These kids have known her new man and his kids for less than 11 months and already they are living together. They need time and understanding and a chance to develop a relationship, not have it forced on them.", "NTA but you could have stuck with your tradition without causing harm.", "INFO\n\n> Lily has 3 kids - Jade 17, Leila 15 and Aaron 13\n\n> Dave has 2 kids - Jack 9 and Saffy 11\n\n> The age difference between the kids means they don\u2019t have much in common and don\u2019t get on that well\n\nBut isn't this the **same** age difference for *everyone*?\n\n2 years, 2 years, 2 years, 2 years.", "I don't think you're an ahole but the tradition should change.

(You mention one of them bursting into tears). If you want this to remain a private activity, that\u2019s fine, but you needed to make that clear to Lily privately, and asked her to make sure Dave was on the same page as far as what the plan was, and given them time to make separate special plans with the younger two. \n\nThis was all handled very poorly, and from the tone of your post, it sounds like you didn\u2019t speak very maturely or kindly to Dave.

Op likes it, the kids like it.", "I couldn\u2019t fit in what happened because of the character limit, Lily had gone for a takeaway with Dave and Jack and Saffy, when they left Jade FaceTimed me with her siblings sat in the living room and we were talking for about 30 minutes. \nDave had come back through the back door which leads to the kitchen and overheard some of the conversation and assumed I was taking all the kids and that\u2019s when he came in and asked what time we were going and how much money was needed, his kids then came in and asked where they were going and that\u2019s when it got awkward and Leila said we were going to the markets but his kids weren\u2019t even invited. \nThat\u2019s when I started to explain to Dave but Saffy was already having a tantrum because Lilys kids made it clear to her and Jack they wanted to go alone. \n\nI tried to fit all that in but I couldn\u2019t, I wasn\u2019t just talking about going in front of them when I didn\u2019t plan to take them, the conversation wasn\u2019t supposed to be overheard. \n\nI was very kind to Dave and said I\u2019d try to plan another activity another time but I\u2019d struggle taking 5 kids on the train and keeping an eye on them - especially when his kids are younger and require more supervision. \nI apologised for upsetting them and then suggested he and Lily take all the kids, even though I was looking forward to going. \n\nI\u2019m so happy that Lily has met someone, I\u2019ve been hoping for years that she would meet someone and be happy, she is the most important person in the world to me.  I just don\u2019t want her to rush into a situation when they were really happy living apart. \n\nI have a long term partner and it\u2019s never affected mine and Lilys friendship and same when she was married. I know I don\u2019t have to worry about Dave taking her away our friendship is too strong for that. \nI do worry about giving the wrong advice (when asked) and that she\u2019s going to struggle with Dave\u2019s kids because they are a handful. \nThere\u2019s lot more to the story then the character limit will allow.", "Found Dave.", ">I wish I\u2019d said something before they moved in but it\u2019s a bit late now.\n\nIt doesn't sound like she'd really have listened to you if she's siding with the partner. Eleven months from meeting to moving in together seems really rushed, especially with kids in the mix - kids of exam taking age and mid teens which can already be a difficult stage. She's really screwed up here.\n\nThat all said, NTA, she's an adult, she's made her decision and there's not a lot you can do about it. I think you've said your piece and very sensibly not forced the issue. I can see why the kids wanted someone to stand up for them but that someone should be their mother!", "You didn't do anything wrong, but very possibly you're going to be refused contact with the biokids that does not also include the stepkids. Lily and Dave have a very firm vision of their family - they will try to bend reality to fit that vision.\n\nMore than likely this will fail utterly and Lily will alienate her own kids.\n\nPerhaps you can see them on the rare occasion when biodad makes an appearance.", "You guys consider each other to be family, right? \n\n\nYou've known each other for a long time, right?\n\n\nThe kids came to you for help, right?\n\n\nI'd be veeeeeerrry careful, and delicate about it, but it seems some conversations need to be had.\n\n\n\nEdit: what I mean is that while it isn't exactly your place to butt into their parenting, you've been put into an awkward position. If you talk to the parents, you will draw their ire. If you don't, the kids will feel betrayed. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. But something needs said to clear the air and set boundaries for yourself and your friendship. I don't envy it. \n\nYou are the one who has to live with whatever consequences, good or bad, come from what you say and do. \n\nI wish you luck.", "I hate all this love will find a way. Often that way results in no or limited contact after they leave the house. It takes hard work and lots of discussions for blended families - and the older ones are bound to feel left out as younger ones demand more attention.\n\nStay strong for Lily\u2019s 3 kids as you may be their singular advocate and they desperately need one when thrown into a blended family where their own mom is no longer listening. While don\u2019t  undermine Lily, her kids likely need an adult figure they can trust and has their interests front and center. That\u2019s a VERY important role. And that\u2019s not Lily right now.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to sound so strong, but my sister recently passed and my 30 yo daughter went on and on about how important her aunt had been to her when she was struggling. I hadn\u2019t really appreciated that, but I\u2019m grateful my sister was there for her.", "Dave is a control freak and he sounds like he has no idea how to raise his kids. Blaming it on the hormones? \ud83e\udd23 yeah right. Hopefully that relationship wont last. Him and his kids sound like a nightmare", "Of course I do! She had bonded with her friend's kids and then with her. Now her friends husband wants to impost HIS kids on their holiday. No reason for her to put out when she has no bond with them. I said they should establish their own traditions because they are not OP's kids, but OP is absolutely correct not to include friend's husband's kids.", "Your additional context does help. I still think the best solution is for you to stick with your same tradition and for Lily and Dave to plan something special separately for the younger two."]}
