Weird of your aunt to be fighting battles for her 23 year old son. Also weird that getting knocked over by a goat is something she sees as a battle. Also weird that your cousin is 23 and doesn't know how to leave animals alone.", "NTA\n\nGoats gonna goat", "NTA. He's 23 ffs. Listen up when someone warns you about their animals, or have enough respect and common sense to not approach animals you aren't familiar with.

Some people just don't have any sense in their heads. Like my neighbor's guests who decided to mess with the Canadian geese after I warned them to stay away from the nesting ANGRY geese from hell.

You were not with them and they are old enough to understand a goat is getting mad.\n\nTheir own stupid fault for getting to close.", "NTA, you made it clear and so did the goat, it seems", "As someone who has spent time around goats. There is a REASONS they were considered the Devil's animal. Not just the automatic inverted pentacle. Your cousin is lucky they weren't harmed.

Mommy can kiss it better.  \n\nAlfy was doing his thing protecting his space.   \n\nYou told them not to go near Alfy.    \n\nCousin will be fine and learned he should have listened to you.", "Nta- you gave a warning it's not your fault your cousin didn't listen.. your parents could've easily given the warning along with anyone else aware of the cunty goat.. it's not your fault people don't listen.", "NTA. You literally made it clear and told them to avoid Alfy. \n\nYour cousin probably consciously avoided your advice. It\u2019s on him for not listening to the advice of someone who lives there!", "NTA.", "Your aunt came really came and complained your 23 year old nephew didn't follow directions?!?! NTA.", "Your 23 year old cousin ignored your best advice and then went whining to mommy?  NTA", "NTA. I raise goats for a living and am dying at this. \n\nNext time, bring him around Alfy when he's full on in rut.
