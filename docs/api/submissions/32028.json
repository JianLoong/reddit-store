Your brother's criminal activity got him arrested.  I'd go no contact with anyone bitching at me about it.  BTW a lot of places it's the DA's decision when it comes to criminal charges.", "NTA.

From what you've shared, it seems you took appropriate action by contacting the police when your security system indicated a break-in.\n\nYour brother's actions, regardless of the family dynamics, were illegal. It's not about getting him arrested for the sake of revenge but rather holding him accountable for his actions. Pressing charges in such a situation is a way to enforce the consequences of breaking the law.\n\nIt's understandable that emotions are intense, especially within the family. However, your decision to involve the authorities stems from a breach of trust and the violation of your personal space. Navigating these family dynamics can be challenging, but seeking legal recourse for illegal actions isn't inherently wrong.\n\nIn the end, it's about upholding the principles of justice and personal boundaries. You're not the A-hole for taking action to protect your property and well-being.", "NTA.  You do him no favors by dropping the charges.  He needs to face the consequences of his actions.

He did the crime, he should do the time.", "NTA for a reason I hadn\u2019t seen yet. If you let him off the hook, it sends the message that he can continue to wronging you in the future. The rest of the family enables him and he expects it, including from you. This lets him and the rest of your family know that you will not be part of that dynamic. You might also not feel safe in your home knowing it could happen again.   \n\n\nGood foresight on installing a security system.", "You did not get your brother arrested.  You alarm went off, you sent the police to check it out and they  found a guy had broke in and was stealing items - so they arrest him\n\nHow the hell were you to know it was your brother and even if you did, he did B&E and was stealing - he deserved to be arrested and deserves to have charges pressed\n\nIt seems like he is a bit entitled and thinks he can have whatever he wants even if it isn't his, he'll just  steal it.\n\nI'm glad you have a security system, make sure it is the best one you can have - all windows, doors and cameras\n\nI would ignore family and press charges, he needs to suffer the consequences of what he did,  no telling what the judge will say - he might just get a slap on the wrist, but he will have a record of being arrested for B&E.    \n\nBut if he is that stupid to think he can get away with that, don't be surprised if he tries it again\n\nI would take any valuable items your Gram had such as jewelry, silver and put them in a lockbox at your bank or have a floor or wall safe installed, one that is rated as very hard to break into and put everything of value in it", "NTA, but I need to know if you're only pressing charges because it's your Golden Child brother or if you would've pressed charges even if it was some rando.\n\nI get the weird feeling that you're pressing charges only because you're bitter and have the upper hand now.\n\nI'm not absolving him and he does need to face the consequences for the trespassing and burglary.

Its very simple. It wasn't OP's actions that got him arrested, it was her brothers. He seems like a real tool.", "> You did not get your brother arrested, your brother got himself arrested.\n\nAbsolutely this. Nor is OP a snitch, getting him arrested for something that had nothing to do with her. She called the police with no knowledge of it being her brother, so in essence, her family should be cool with any random walking into that house and stealing all of her grandma's stuff. \n\nChoosing to press charges is a different manner (since now she knows who it is), but I still think OP is in the right. Where I am, if they catch the criminal and you choose not to press charges, insurance rates go through the roof because you become a statistical liability. Why should she have to pay more because he's an AH?", "NTA I would also consider changing the combination for the safe, you don't know if he managed to get that info before he broke in. \n\nMy paranoid side says to have experts take a look at the current security system and evaluate for improvements. If your brother gets out on bail he may be stupid enough to go back to damage the house for revenge, or to damage your possessions in your parents house when you're out. \n\nOP it's time to plan your escape from your parents house. You don't want to be there if he gets out on bail. At a minimum get all of your important papers and jewelry out of the house, and any valuable possessions you don't absolutely have to have. \n\nThis is critical, sign up for an online backup service for your computer, and make sure the computer/laptop itself is encrypted and needs a password to start up. I fully expect he will damage or steal anything he can that would cause you a problem, I have no doubt he's going to blame all of his problems on you and will want to make you suffer for having him arrested.", "Some places has good cops and i didn\u2019t know it was a robbery I just knew someone was in my house"]}
