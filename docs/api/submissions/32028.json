Family opinions be damned, letting this go will unleash a monster into society more than they already have. \n\nThink about it. If someone breaks into your home, steals your stuff, all while mistakenly believing they're entitled to do so, and then they get away with it, no real consequences aside from a brief scare...

If they get away with this, they're going to come for your stuff, your future partner's, etc. \n\nHere's another scary thought. Your brother might even realize he can mistreat others on the scale he did to you just now, and still get praised and backed up. People who are this entitled are usually textbook narcissists and/or end up being incredibly abusive to their partner and kids. The crazy part is, because of getting away with genuinely criminal and abusive stuff and family protecting the abuser, the potential abuse could go on indefinitely. This mentality is near impossible to shatter, especially when everyone is taking the perpetrator's side, so, at a minimum, the perpetrator should at least learn they can't harm you without severe consequences.

This is no different, except that he tried to rob his own sibling for items belonging to our dead grandmother.\" If they can't understand why you're in the right here, drop them out of your life. \n\nRelatives are biology, family is a choice. Your brother treated you like a stranger, not like family, and your relatives need to get their priorities straight before you engage with them like they are family.", "Fuck no. And serious talk\u2026.it might be past time to cut your family off.", "Actions have consequences. NTA", "NTA, he needs to face consequences of his actions!

You are doing him a favor in not endulging his criminal behavior.", "Brother got himself arrested for breaking the law", "NTA. Am I the only person who has noticed that the brother was also TRYING TO STEAL MONEY FROM THE SAFE??? You have every right to press charges and the fact that your parents are not upset with your brother is beyond fucked up.", "NTA.\n\nHe chose to commit a crime. He got caught. He deserves what the legal consequences are for his actions.\n\nOP deserves a better family (other than the aunt, who is a keeper).", "NTA - \"Look, he might be your favorite, but he definitely isn't mine. I have no interest in discussing this further and if you push the subject I will just temporarily block you until you accept that my brother is facing the consequences of his illegal activities\"", "No. He needs to learn that his actions have consequences. And it is your right to set healthy boundaries not only with your brother, but your parents and other family members.", "NTA and fuck him and glad he finally got what he deserved!", "NTA - press charges and do not go easy on him.  Truthfully he and your parents are awful people.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t get your brother arrested. He got himself arrested.\n\nI don\u2019t know where you\u2019re located, but with a criminal charge it\u2019s possible that the state can/will continue with the charges without you.

Of course your parents are defending him now. I assume your grandmother knew what was going on if she left the house to you. \n\nIt is about time someone held your brother repsonsible for his behaviour. If you had not had him arrested, he would have continued to bo a problem.

The only thing worse than being a criminal and stealing stuff is being a criminal and stealing from your family. \n\nI would have pressed charges too.", "NTA. You literally didn't do anything wrong. Your brother is a jerk who thinks he can do anything and your family is enabling him. I hope you're doing great in school ik college can be kinda rough", "NTA. And Good job.", "NTA.

Comes under bought and paid for.", "NTA.  Do the crime, do the time.", "Lets be clear...and I don't know why people always do this, but YOU DID NOT GET YOUR BROTHER ARRESTED.

Not to mention the fact that you didn\u2019t know who it was. You did it for your own safety and that\u2019s what\u2019s important here. It\u2019s unfair of your family to hold you to this impossible to meet standard of knowing your brother is stealing from you. It\u2019s such an odd standard to have. It\u2019s so much more important to have been safe and taken care of yourself. If they can\u2019t understand that then it\u2019s their problem. You aren\u2019t a problem, you did everything right, you\u2019re doing great, and if nobody else says it then I will, I\u2019m proud of you.", "NTA.

My shitty smack-addict childhood friend did over his mum's house and sister's house before going on to do an armed robbery on a post office.

You may be doing him a favour by playing this card before it escalates further.", "NTA - You didn't know it was him at the time and now look at what he was doing.

Right? \nSo if he attacks you with a machete, or he forges your checks, or commits any other crimes, you should just give the Nice Boy brother a pass? NOT EVER! He does the crime, he does the time. F him!", "I am astounded anyone could read this story and believe it. But here we are.", "Nta You do the time if you do the crime.", "NTA - Uh . . . he was the one who chose to break into a house and steal items. What's to question here? He is a CRIMINAL for doing such a thing and needs to be arrested. Some jail time will give him the opportunity to learn that he isn't the golden child out in the world. But I doubt that he will learn his lesson. Do NOT drop the charges.", "Nta! You needed to do something to convince your entitled bro that your stuff is not his stuff. Legal paperwork was not enough to achieve that goal. Maybe legal proceedings will be. \n\nYou know you can work with the prosecutor on this, right. If you want a stiff sentence, they will go after that. If you want to make your point, but let him off easy, you can ask the prosecutor to make a deal with him. You could drop charges if bro agrees to sign something stating he will never go to the house again, his presence there is trespassing,  and  the charges will be reinstated if he ever shows up. \n\nI really think the sitting in jail, and going to court may be enough to scare him off, but I don't know your bro like you do.

You did the right thing and I\u2019m glad at at least have your aunt", "NTA. He got himself arrested.", "NTA. Your brother is TA. Let me say that again, your brother who was trying to steal your property is TA, period. He could have asked for some of grandma's things, but let's be honest, he wanted things of value, not things with sentimental value. I say that as I sit here in my office where I have small mementos from my late grandmothers to remind me of them. When they passed I was asked what I wanted of theirs and these objects were what I asked for.   \n\n\nYes, press charges. Refer any questions about that to the prosecutor's office, as your brother is now their problem. IF this is his first brush with the law he might work out a plea bargain so any punishment would be mild. But, and this is important, my guess is that this is not his first criminal problem. And even if it is his first, this may be the wakeup call your brother needs to prevent him from doing something like this with much more serious consequence.", "Don\u2019t want to get arrested maybe don\u2019t break into someone else\u2019s home\u2026..duh!", "NTA He is.  He broke into YOUR house to STEAL your things.  Prosecute him.  You and your Auntie are 1000% correct", "NTA, of course!  He broke in and tried to steal from you. That\u2019s serious sh it.", "NTA\nIt's not like you intentionally got him arrested. HE got himself arrested by breaking into a house he has no rights to AND STEALING THINGS FROM INSIDE.

OP is the owner of a property and was informed by law enforcement in the area that they apprehended a criminal, she pressed charges. It's a high crime area and the criminal just so happens to be known to OP, and the family of the criminal are a bunch of dramatic enablers who don't respect OP.\n\nToss the whole lot of them out with the criminal. They don't respect OP and they could all be served with some restraining orders for harassment in my books.", "This sub is just a creative writing sub now. Very formulaic:\n- Extremely one sided relationship with family for no apparent reason other than to garner sympathy right off the bat\n- OP is very fortunate (either making 6 figures or inherits a fucking house or some shit)\n- Indefensible action\n- Reasonable response to said action\n- \"My family is blowing up my phone\" (must be included in ALL posts)", "It sounds strange because the story is fake", "I don\u2019t know, a lot of courts and judges love dressing down and making examples out of entitled but dumb people, lolz. \n\nI for one though would love to see the trial; \u201cfolks are you aware your son has been arrested for breaking and entering, vandalism and burglary??\u201d \n\n\u201coH bUt hE\u2019s thE gOLdeN chILd yOUr hOnOR\u201d", "If OP is in the United States she doesn't even get to choose whether or not to press charges, the DA makes the decision.", "Clearly the security system is a snitch and the family should go no contact with it!", "don't forget the fact that there are twins involved. every other story on this sub includes twins", "Yes someone one said there was more inheritance issues than a Victorian novel", "NTA.  You didn't get anyone arrested, he got himself arrested.  If he wasn't your brother, would you press charges?  If the answer is yes, then you did the right thing.  He broke into your house and tried to steal from you.  He belongs in jail.  Like the popular saying goes Don't do the time if you can't do the time.", "Generally true, but in this case the OP can get him out of trouble by telling the DA that he had permission to be on the property and take those things because he's her brother.", "> the DA makes the decision.\n\nDepending on what the charges are, she could decline to press charges. I've had two scenarios where that happened, one which was trespassing, I chose to drop the charges because getting them trespassed off my property was enough, they never came back. Second was for unauthorized use of a vehicle (they then crashed it). I pressed charges because if I didn't, I wasn't going to get paid by insurance, and fuck them for \"borrowing\" my keys and crashing it.", "Why on earth should the OP lie?\n\nIt could even have negative legal consequences for the OP.\n\nAs far as the brother is concerned, there is an old saying: he made his bed, now he has to lie in it.", "Cops will also say sometimes say \"do you want to press charges\" when what they mean is \"I don't give a shit, and if you don't give a shit and aren't willing to cooperate with the prosecution I'm not going to bother with the paperwork.\"", "Obviously she won't and shouldn't; I was just pointing out that when OP found out it was her brother that was arrested for burglary she could've told the police his actions were fine.", "Ya, getting someone out of trouble my making a false police report or statement to the DA is NOT the way to go.", "I don't think the person you're replying to said that the OP *should* lie, just that the OP *could* lie. People do lie about this sort of thing quite often. They generally have their reasons and think those reasons are good ones, and sometimes they're right and it all works out.", "Wasn't a false police report when she made it because she didn't know  who it was who was breaking in.  When she found out it was her brother she could have (if she wanted to) told the police that the guy they arrested was her brother and he had the right to be on the property."]}
