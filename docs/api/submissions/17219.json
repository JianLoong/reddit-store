She hasn't gotten it yet so I decided to get it for her as a gift.

For whatever reason, your parents read through you and knew there was more to your \"joke\".\n\nI agree with your parents that \"mommy\" is more of a kink name than a pet name, and thus something that should be covered up from polite company.

So the joke was that he got his gf a gift cause she wanted it and gave it to her on Mother's Day cause that's how it panned out (I think it was just released yesterday).  If it had been a birthday celebration or just a random gifting, and he said \"Mommy,\" I think that would be cringey. But in the current context, it seems more joking than actual kink.   Now, whether there's some truth to it or not, that's between OP and his partner, if it was a little tongue in cheek.  \n\nIf that happened to us (we have kids but if we didn't) someone on my husband's side (my FIL or BIL most likely) would have said something like, \"hey save the bedroom talk for later.\" And we all would have laughed.

Nothing sexual was ever brought up until your parents brought it up later. And even if that's a name you call her in the bedroom, nobody knows that except you two.

I think it's pretty fair to say it's cultural/socially accepted and widely regarded men acknowledge their wives (and/or female identifying partners) on mother's Day and it's so common that couples even without kids do it as well. Man got her a gift, it's mother's Day, there's nothing wrong with making a funny quip about her being a mommy/mother as that is the qualifying factor to receive a gift on this day.\n\nCan this feature be done without kink involved?

I do agree that family don't need to be involved in your sex life or any kinks you may have but a once-off gift on an occasion usually for moms if given jokingly could just be a gift of a new-release item and not any indication of your sex life. All the important women in your life got a gift, it was Mothers Day but a joking presentation of a gift for a non-mother who is also important in your life isn't wrong but now you know family don't like it you can give gifts in private. I lived with my dad as an old teen / young adult and he called me mom to his dog because I became just as much an owner and pet parents are a thing. I found it weird being a pet parent with my father, he didn't mean anything incestual but was trying to show I was just as important to the dog as he was. When I told him I didn't like it he didn't really understand why, since dogs are dogs and not actual kids conceived by people and I was a dog mom, but he started calling me dog older sibling. He felt I needed more of a title than \"person who lived with dog\" since the dog had anxiety and needed support and training that I helped with, I felt being mom to anything my dad was dad to was weird. So I was dog sibling. Your parents feel weird hearing you call your girlfriend mommy. The easy solution is to give her Mothers Day gifts in private in future and call her whatever you're both comfortable with and be honest about the gift but keep private names private. Or give a gift in public without the private name but use it before or after in private.\n\nPeople can find things a bit uncomfortable that others don't, if it's just a matter of discomfort and otherwise getting on it's not a matter of right or wrong in the first instance but if you know something makes someone uncomfortable and it's a minor thing that can easily be avoided in their presence Y T A for continuing to do it. So you can call your girlfriend mommy, you can buy her gifts for Mothers Day, but now you know your parents are uncomfortable with both in their presence you can easily avoid doing both in their presence in future. Or if it's just \"mommy\" they find uncomfortable you can avoid that, if gift giving needs that between you just give gifts on the day when you aren't with them.", "Theoretically, what if the crowd laughed and your girlfriend would\u2019ve been upset? That\u2019s what you have to think about. But in both situations, NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Tell me you have a boring sex life and no imagination I guess", "Lol omg hahaha my mum wants me to give her a granddaughter but I don\u2019t want to do that so I guess that would have put her hopes up but she wouldn\u2019t have told me off, she would have known it was a joke and then moved on instead of embarrassing me in front of my partner for doing something nice for them. \nParents who embarrass their kids in front of their parents for doing something nice ATAH.", "I also call my partner 'baby' and 'babe' in bed... should I stop calling them that around my parents now too? It can be both a kink and pet name, they're not mutually exclusive.", "Yeah maybe if you really sex focused you jump to that conclusion. Most sane people would look and go \"is this a pregnancy announcement?\"\n\nBabe is said a lot in sexual situations, so is honey, dear, baby. Unless OP has a habit of sexual remarks in non-consenting public situations (which indeed makes him a major AH if he does, that's gross) I'm curious as to why his parents would jump right to \"gross sex kink\". Did he only ever call his own mom \"mother\" while growing up?", "saying it as a joke doesn't change the fact that the second most common line of thinking beyond a pregnancy announcement is that op was bringing some kink stuff into a public situation. time and a place for everything, and some jokes don't need to be shared with everyone.", "It's not unlikely that his parents picked up on it.\n\nIf this was a post about a girl calling her boyfriend \"daddy\" randomly it would be just as rightfully awkward and, quite frankly, impolite.", "But... it IS HIS KINK, and he literally called her it in front of them. They clicked it as a kink. They were uncomfy.\n\nEdit: please explain the joke to me and how it isnt sexual.", "that doesn't make it appropriate", "It was probably intended as both. A reference for her and a joke for everyone else. I don't get how it's immediately sexual. It's mother's day. He gave the woman he probably intends to be with for a long time a gift on mother's day. Called her mommy because it was a joke. I don't get how hard it is to understand that. It's not like he said something explicit. Or anything more suggestive. It's the same thing if I gave my boyfriend a present on Father's day and called him daddy, which I do so casually and have never been called out for doing. No weird stares. No nothing. So don't tell me to cool it. You need to get some common sense. Realistically neither of us were there. Neither of us is the OP. But from similar experience, it was more than likely a mother's day joke. He didn't make it sexual. Everybody in this goddamned comment section is saying it is though because no one can take a fucking joke anymore.

So uncomfortable.", "It reads as a sapphic relationship where a pregnancy has to be pretty well planned. Plus mommy/ mother/ etc is a rather well used term of endearment in the queer community", "For. Real. Like...he put on his kinky-time \"little\" voice to call her Mommy in front of his actual parents? \n\nTmi: As someone in a negotiated and intentional \"Big/little\" kink dynamic (which yes, is hella perverse, Ik/Idc)...this thought skeeves *me* out. Nonono, your actual parents neither need nor want to even imagine that particular dynamic as being a possibility in your mind.\n\nThe only other reason I can think they'd immediately make the assumption it was kink rather than pregnancy is if op has a general history of being inappropriately sexual around his family. Which, either way...not good, son. Not good. \n\nIn this kinkster's opinion, op is in a realm beyond simple garden-variety assholery. The words to describe it accurately will get a commenter banned.", "Small correction, they most likely didn't miss the point. They saw it, and went out of their way to ignore it to continue the argument.\n\nYou might be on top of that, but some people make the mistake in thinking everyone is engaging in good faith.
