For whatever reason, your parents read through you and knew there was more to your \"joke\".\n\nI agree with your parents that \"mommy\" is more of a kink name than a pet name, and thus something that should be covered up from polite company.

So the joke was that he got his gf a gift cause she wanted it and gave it to her on Mother's Day cause that's how it panned out (I think it was just released yesterday).  If it had been a birthday celebration or just a random gifting, and he said \"Mommy,\" I think that would be cringey. But in the current context, it seems more joking than actual kink.   Now, whether there's some truth to it or not, that's between OP and his partner, if it was a little tongue in cheek.  \n\nIf that happened to us (we have kids but if we didn't) someone on my husband's side (my FIL or BIL most likely) would have said something like, \"hey save the bedroom talk for later.\" And we all would have laughed.

I think it's pretty fair to say it's cultural/socially accepted and widely regarded men acknowledge their wives (and/or female identifying partners) on mother's Day and it's so common that couples even without kids do it as well.

I do agree that family don't need to be involved in your sex life or any kinks you may have but a once-off gift on an occasion usually for moms if given jokingly could just be a gift of a new-release item and not any indication of your sex life. All the important women in your life got a gift, it was Mothers Day but a joking presentation of a gift for a non-mother who is also important in your life isn't wrong but now you know family don't like it you can give gifts in private. I lived with my dad as an old teen / young adult and he called me mom to his dog because I became just as much an owner and pet parents are a thing. I found it weird being a pet parent with my father, he didn't mean anything incestual but was trying to show I was just as important to the dog as he was. When I told him I didn't like it he didn't really understand why, since dogs are dogs and not actual kids conceived by people and I was a dog mom, but he started calling me dog older sibling. He felt I needed more of a title than \"person who lived with dog\" since the dog had anxiety and needed support and training that I helped with, I felt being mom to anything my dad was dad to was weird. So I was dog sibling. Your parents feel weird hearing you call your girlfriend mommy. The easy solution is to give her Mothers Day gifts in private in future and call her whatever you're both comfortable with and be honest about the gift but keep private names private. Or give a gift in public without the private name but use it before or after in private.\n\nPeople can find things a bit uncomfortable that others don't, if it's just a matter of discomfort and otherwise getting on it's not a matter of right or wrong in the first instance but if you know something makes someone uncomfortable and it's a minor thing that can easily be avoided in their presence Y T A for continuing to do it. So you can call your girlfriend mommy, you can buy her gifts for Mothers Day, but now you know your parents are uncomfortable with both in their presence you can easily avoid doing both in their presence in future. Or if it's just \"mommy\" they find uncomfortable you can avoid that, if gift giving needs that between you just give gifts on the day when you aren't with them.", "Theoretically, what if the crowd laughed and your girlfriend would\u2019ve been upset? That\u2019s what you have to think about. But in both situations, NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You sound super thoughtful to give a gift to your mom and your girlfriend's mom and then give a gift to your girlfriend too just because you're handing out gifts.\n\nI would have thought you called her \"mommy\" ironically as a joke because you were giving her a gift on Mother's Day and you just wanted to make other people laugh.\n\nBut apparently your parents know something about you that made them suspect it wasn't just a joke so I guess your parents are pretty sharp and you got called out!", "to each their own, i call my brother daddy and he calls me husband", "YTA just because you made it weird for no reason. If you and your wife have sexual nicknames for each other, use them in the bedroom or privately no one needs to here her call you \"The Big Hammer\" at the table. Use some tact, class, and discretion.", "NTA.   In this situation, on mother's day, when presenting gifts, there was nothing sexual about it.   And everyone at the table understood and took it as a joke.\n\nIt's your parents who read into it and sexualized it on their own.", "I think it\u2019s simple, and this is just my opinion. \n\n1. NTA- If you were making a joke after giving your mom and her mom their gifts you then turned and said \u201c\u2026.and now for your gift mommy\u201d and it was somewhat exaggerated and you were just playing around cause it\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day. \n\n2. YTA- If you gave your partner her gift and said something like \u201cand here is yours mommy\u201d, while rubbing her leg, and taking a sip of a mimosa, well then you\u2019re an AH, a creep and a whole host of other things. \n\nEdit- After reading my own reply, it\u2019s still nothing I would imagine saying, although it is something I have done/do in my own bedroom. I don\u2019t know enough about you or the context of the situation to form a definitive opinion. In the future I would just be mindful of what you say.", "YTA- reverse the gender rolls and everyone would be calling you TA.", "YTA. Best case scenario, it comes off as a pregnancy announcement. Worse case scenario, you've involuntarily dragged your company into a kink.", "NTA - you have her a gift on a specific day and recognised that by making a joke recognising that. I see no issue here.", "I laughed so loud I startled the taxi driver.", "I agree with this. Like OP isn\u2019t exactly an AH, but oh dear god do not do that. And in front of your mom. Like no. Absolutely not. It\u2019s so weird and this definitely falls into the category of things your parents have a right not to know.", "True.  I feel like everyone only laughed because it was an awkward situation, especially since I\u2019m assuming OP and the girlfriend don\u2019t have any kids.\n\n\u2018Mommy\u2019 or \u2018Daddy\u2019 just feels like a weird pet name to call a significant other, especially in public.", "If I were at that table, I would assume that this was a subtle pregnancy announcement.  \n\nBoth families are there.  It's mother's day weekend.  That's exactly the time many people would announce they were expecting...", "It doesn\u2019t sound like their actual kink though. It sounds like he only called her mommy as a joke because he was giving her a gift on Mother\u2019s Day. Not that it\u2019s something they actually do.", "You and his parents are making assumptions. Irrespective of that plenty of straight couples call their partners mommy or daddy respectively. It\u2019s not a kink. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s saying \u201chere\u2019s your gift mommy\u201d and then fucking her or pulling her hair. It\u2019s no different than \u201chere\u2019s your gift baby\u201d or \u201chere\u2019s your gift honey\u201d", "Unconsenting in all caps about him calling someone mommy. \n\nHe didn't try to have sex with the others at the table. Relax.", "By that logic you could also never say \u201coh my god\u201d \u201cdon\u2019t stop\u201d \u201cbaby\u201d \u201cmore\u201d \u201charder\u201d \u201cright there\u201d \u201cYes\u201d \u201cI\u2019m coming\u201d All these are NON SEXUAL words that people routinely say during sex. Where do you draw the line ?? Why do you get to decide what people are allowed to say ??", "You sound like you\u2019ve got mummy issues \ud83d\ude02", "Exactly, plus it shows disrespect to all real mothers.", "This absolutely was not the situation", "Lmao crying because you has to hear someone's lewd name for someone else.", "\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "That was correct \ud83d\udc4d and this is the funniest comment under this post", "The GF didn\u2019t care.", "Right? Feel like I'm crazy reading the top comments \ud83d\ude02", "Frankly I\u2019m more surprised someone didn\u2019t take it as a pregnancy announcement.", "He says in his first sentence that he calls her mommy in bed lmao how is it not a sexual thing?", "Yea I agree. Saying this in the context of Mother\u2019s Day doesn\u2019t implicate anything sexual. Seems like not a big deal to me", "Yeah NTA who said it was even anything to do with your sex life. They all can get fucked", "This but like when you actually do say it as a kink, you\u2019re an AH lol", "You said nothing about your sex life. Shame on your parents for assuming that you were. Their reaction says a lot about them and nothing about you. NTA", "Except OP specifically announces it was sexual in his post!  \n\nOP did something specifically sexual in front of his family, and then is trying to hide behind the fact that it can be construed as non-sexual, despite his family knowing him well enough to know that it *was* sexual.  \n\nHe's trying to play innocent, while at the same time forcing his sexual life onto his family.", "I mean kinks are genetic so", "OP should have said \u201cActually I call her Daddy\u201d\n\n/s", "\"unless you moaned it's not sexual\" is absurd lol i'm gonna start saying that. your second point is good though, i agree with you", "Honestly. I think it is a funny joke. I would have laughed.", "It\u2019s very different if you don\u2019t have kids together lmao wtf\n\nEdit: also OP\u2019s first sentence is literally \u2018don\u2019t judge me for what I call my girlfriend in bed\u2019 so by their own omission, it\u2019s a sexual thing. Weird AF to say in front of your family.", "Yeah\u2026 when they are parents and you have kids around.\n\nWhat this guy was is weird and creepy in front of the people he did it with HIS FUCKING PARENTS", "Bro. It\u2019s not that deep.", "I would have though they were announcing she was pregnant.", "I agree there, my partner and I do have a child together and I call him daddy in the context of \"did you see what *our kid* did daddy\" and even though it's not sexual at all for us bc I only ever call him that in the context of being a dad and never in a sexual manner, I still only do it at home bc of how the nickname can be perceived.", "That\u2019s my feeling, it\u2019s common in awkward situations to react with laughter, and usually not because it\u2019s funny. What you do in the bedroom is your business, but leave it in the bedroom. I am one of those people who ever understood the whole mommy daddy thing during sex. I don\u2019t want to call the guy I\u2019m having sex  with daddy, and I sure as hell don\u2019t want the world mommy coming out of their mouth. And if my bf called me that in public I would be mortified YTA", "Once you have kids you can use them just fine.  \ud83d\ude1d", "OPs first sentence is about how this is what he calls his girlfriend in bed. That kinda gives the impression it\u2019s a sexual thing soooo\u2026.\n\nThe only time I\u2019ve ever heard couples call each other that and it\u2019s been non-sexual is when they\u2019re talking to their kids about the other parent. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with kinks, until you start doing it around people who haven\u2019t consented. That\u2019s when you\u2019re going to be judged", "Yeah no. Honey & dear don\u2019t imply a *parental relationship*\u2026 calling someone you fuck \u201cmom/dad\u201d is very different than calling them by basically any other pet name. \n\nIt\u2019s 1000% a kink thing, and he *unnecessarily* involved his family in it. They don\u2019t have kids, so it\u2019s kind of\u2026 extremely obvious that this is sexual in nature.", "No, definitely not the same. Unless a couple have young kids together, and it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s a parental thing, then it\u2019s an obvious kink and shouldn\u2019t be used around non-consenting people. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I dgaf what anyone else consensually enjoys, but kinks are inherently sexual and everything sexual requires consent. \n\nI mean, it\u2019s not rocket science. \n\nThis is a clear YTA", "Agreed besides, what does his mother expect to happen if they get married and have kids? I think lots of men hand their wives gifts on Mother\u2019s Day and say happy Mother\u2019s Day mommy or mom. It\u2019s not even dirty given the context. His parents made it weird", "Best comment", "First of all individually those are all innocuous. Together in that sequence though? Obviously sexual and inappropriate to say in a family/public setting. Calling your romantic partner by a nickname that implies parenthood when there are no kids to speak of? Implies either a pregnancy announcement or a kink. It clearly wasn\u2019t the former so it was obviously the latter.  For example: i could say \u201coh jump off the bridge already\u201d to someone bungee jumping and it would be fine or I could say \u201coh jump off the bridge already\u201d to someone about to commit suicide. Same words, wildly different intentions.

Asshole, nah.", "I was expecting that to be the case as well", "He told Reddit that he didn't walk up to his parents and go \"I call her mommy in bed\"", "he doesn't necessarily say that, but it could be assumed by us here on reddit. are we his parents though? did he tell his parents he calls her mommy in bed?", "NOBODY WANTS TO THINK ABOUT THIS", "My thoughts exactly!!!", "OP has no complaints with parents (unless they didn't say something) besides parents thinking OP calling GF mommy is sexual.

He didn\u2019t say it\u2019s his actual kink and no it isn\u2019t obvious that it was sexual. I wouldn\u2019t have seen it that way unless he said mommy in a sexy voice or winked at her or something. Jumping straight to it being \u201cobviously\u201d sexual is a stretch.", "but what about \"baby\" as the comment you responded mentioned? baby has become so normalized that many people don't see it as infantilism, or a parent/child relationship... which can be pretty messed up in other ways.", "Of course I don\u2019t mean that you would say them all in a row. It\u2019s literally just a list.

There are things that are appropriate to say in one setting and inappropriate in another, the context is what decides if someone can or can\u2019t say it. Someone expressing that they don\u2019t want that thing to be said around them or in certain settings decides if someone can or can\u2019t say something. His parents get to decide he can\u2019t call his girlfriend mommy in a public family setting because the context is that it\u2019s sexual and it makes them uncomfortable and don\u2019t want him to say it in front of them because it\u2019s inappropriate.
