She hasn't gotten it yet so I decided to get it for her as a gift.

For whatever reason, your parents read through you and knew there was more to your \"joke\".\n\nI agree with your parents that \"mommy\" is more of a kink name than a pet name, and thus something that should be covered up from polite company.

So the joke was that he got his gf a gift cause she wanted it and gave it to her on Mother's Day cause that's how it panned out (I think it was just released yesterday).  If it had been a birthday celebration or just a random gifting, and he said \"Mommy,\" I think that would be cringey. But in the current context, it seems more joking than actual kink.   Now, whether there's some truth to it or not, that's between OP and his partner, if it was a little tongue in cheek.  \n\nIf that happened to us (we have kids but if we didn't) someone on my husband's side (my FIL or BIL most likely) would have said something like, \"hey save the bedroom talk for later.\" And we all would have laughed.

It\u2019s clear that she\u2019s no one\u2019s mother \u2014 pet or human! - so the crowd probably picked up immediately that this was a \u201cspecial\u201d nickname that you use in private. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t take a genius to make the link here, either, and you decided to use Mother\u2019s Day to let the world know you\u2019ve got this kink. \n\nThis isn\u2019t like other pet names, either.

Nothing sexual was ever brought up until your parents brought it up later. And even if that's a name you call her in the bedroom, nobody knows that except you two.

I think it's pretty fair to say it's cultural/socially accepted and widely regarded men acknowledge their wives (and/or female identifying partners) on mother's Day and it's so common that couples even without kids do it as well. Man got her a gift, it's mother's Day, there's nothing wrong with making a funny quip about her being a mommy/mother as that is the qualifying factor to receive a gift on this day.\n\nCan this feature be done without kink involved?

I do agree that family don't need to be involved in your sex life or any kinks you may have but a once-off gift on an occasion usually for moms if given jokingly could just be a gift of a new-release item and not any indication of your sex life. All the important women in your life got a gift, it was Mothers Day but a joking presentation of a gift for a non-mother who is also important in your life isn't wrong but now you know family don't like it you can give gifts in private. I lived with my dad as an old teen / young adult and he called me mom to his dog because I became just as much an owner and pet parents are a thing. I found it weird being a pet parent with my father, he didn't mean anything incestual but was trying to show I was just as important to the dog as he was. When I told him I didn't like it he didn't really understand why, since dogs are dogs and not actual kids conceived by people and I was a dog mom, but he started calling me dog older sibling. He felt I needed more of a title than \"person who lived with dog\" since the dog had anxiety and needed support and training that I helped with, I felt being mom to anything my dad was dad to was weird. So I was dog sibling. Your parents feel weird hearing you call your girlfriend mommy. The easy solution is to give her Mothers Day gifts in private in future and call her whatever you're both comfortable with and be honest about the gift but keep private names private. Or give a gift in public without the private name but use it before or after in private.\n\nPeople can find things a bit uncomfortable that others don't, if it's just a matter of discomfort and otherwise getting on it's not a matter of right or wrong in the first instance but if you know something makes someone uncomfortable and it's a minor thing that can easily be avoided in their presence Y T A for continuing to do it. So you can call your girlfriend mommy, you can buy her gifts for Mothers Day, but now you know your parents are uncomfortable with both in their presence you can easily avoid doing both in their presence in future. Or if it's just \"mommy\" they find uncomfortable you can avoid that, if gift giving needs that between you just give gifts on the day when you aren't with them.", "Theoretically, what if the crowd laughed and your girlfriend would\u2019ve been upset? That\u2019s what you have to think about. But in both situations, NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
