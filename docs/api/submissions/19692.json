This one colleague and I ordered the same meal. When the meal came, the portion was bigger than expected.

She said to me, \"You have to pay me back xxx (full price)\". I was confused and think it's unfair that I have to pay full price for something that we shared but I didn't want to argue with her so I paid. \n\nAnd then when we got to the office, she started chasing me telling me that I forgot to pay the service tax, which after been divided by the total of us, came up as ONLY $1. I told her that I'll pay her soon after I finish my meeting and she kept buggung me. I got really annoyed and told her, \"I paid full price for the meal we shared, you could have at least let the service tax of $1 go\". She got angry and told me that I'm being calculative and that I'm being an AH for not paying back the service tax. \n\nAITA? \n\nI'm sorry if the story is hard to understand, not a native speaker!\n\nEdit: I did pay back the service tax after.", "created_utc": 1686769034, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149fxkj/aita_for_refusing_the_pay_service_tax_of_the_meal/", "score": 136, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your assumption was fair and you probably shouldn't share with that colleague anymore. That's ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nAnd what more you learned a valuable lesson about your coworker in a very benign situation.
