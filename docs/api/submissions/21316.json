This was an issue of common sense and basic logic, that the colour of human skin does not make someone fundamentally LESS HUMAN or a different kind of human being . . . that's a trope that goes back centuries (millennia?) and feeds into the kind of racism where even doctors were taught that Black people had \"thicker skin\" and \"didn't feel pain the same way\".\n\nPut bluntly: your son's friend's mother was racist AF and risked your son's immediate health and well-being because of her fundamentally racist beliefs (he could have ended up in terrible pain if he'd gotten sunburned). She treated him differently (and worse) than all of the other children in her care, when you trusted her to be the adult responsible for him, even after he specifically came out and asked her to treat him the same (BTW, that was her learning moment, if your wife was concerned; your son basically TOLD her . . . this child KNEW that he needed sunscreen and she still refused). \n\nYou are NTA in every way. She deserved to be called out, and being openly racist to a small child in your care does not warrant a response of kindness or gentleness from that child's parents.  She needed her racism to be named for what it was, and if she felt hurt or shaken up by your accusations, then good . . . she should feel bad for what she did.", "NTA. She's ignorant and neglecting your child because of it. He even asked for sunscreen and she ignored him, assuming she knows his body better than she does.

It would have taken so little of kindness to go, \"Here you go honey, let me know if you need help with your back\" like Any. Other. Child. but instead she refused?? That is some next level meanness just for refusing a few drops of protection to one of the kids. That makes her the AH and you the protector, imho.\n\nIt was a teachable moment, but you shouldn't need to be the teacher. Kindness and care for children in your temporary custody is supposed to be a given. Did you need to attack and name-call? Not really, but we see why you were upset. It was like .20cents worth of sunscreen ffs, so even with her stupidity she doesn't really have an excuse.\n\nEDITED to add: It would have been an N A H if that mom had apologized and said she didn't realize but would know for next time, but instead she decided to double down and then blame OP for not being psychic to know her child would need sunscreen for an unplanned beach trip.", "NTA at all, and for the Y T A and E S H votes\u2026\u2026look. I\u2019m white too. I grew up with the assumption that people with darker skin than mine didn\u2019t burn as easily as me, and never really had reason to question it.

She assumed she knew more than your son about his own skincare. \n\nThis all comes back to this parent treating your child differently because of skin color.\n\nWhen faced with that reality this parent didn\u2019t apologize.

Beach isn\u2019t only place sunscreen is needed. If your gonna be outside, you send supplies like water bottle and sunscreen.", "Maybe it\u2019s because I live in south, but when you send kids out. Sunscreen is part of the kit, it\u2019s required for any outdoor activities. Especially at such young age of 8.", "But what did it accomplish. Did anything change ? Don\u2019t spend your emotional capital one situations that you can\u2019t change. Like Michelle says, take the high road", "I meant she was ignorant for assuming that which is what the OP said. Lord, context people.", "I don't believe for a second that you think black people are the only people with dark skin.", "Cheezits man, black people are not the only dark skinned people.  Have you ever met a SE Asian person, Mediterranean person, South Asian, Latin American person or middle eastern person.  I don't believe that for a second.", "> Lol, no. I assumed they were black due to the context of the post\n\nThere's a problem right there.  Why do you assume anybody with dark skin is automatically black?", "> OP said their child is black in other comments.\n\nNo they didn't.", "Stupid but serious question. How do I know it\u2018s a bot wo I can report it?", "I\u2019m not saying the mom wasn\u2019t a butthole, but there are other ways to respond. If OP was so worried about skin cancer, maybe when beach invite was tendered did OP offer. \u201c hey do I need to run anything over like swim trunks, water or sunscreen \u201c", "Nothing said they were planning to go outside in the first place. Just that the beach was a last minute plan otherwise they would have packed sunscreen.", "Still missing the part where the beach wasn't part of the original plan, huh?", "I think it ensured that the mother won\u2019t fuck with OP\u2019s kid like that again.", "That doesn\u2019t make sense\u2026 I can\u2019t decipher from the \u201ccontext\u201d that you meant something different, than what you wrote down.", "You\u2019re so fucking dense. This racist rhetoric has been thrown at people of color for ages, the OP already said their son was black.\n\nWhat fucking racist point are you trying to highlight before we all get the right idea and assume you\u2019re the racist here", "I don't assume evrrybody with dark skin is black, nor do I think it's a problem in this case. For the intents and purposes of understanding this issue it makes no difference. The assumption of them having dark skin is all that is necessary, had nothing to do with OP being an angry parent as you stated. Stop moving your goalposts. \n\nThere is nothing inherently racist about assuming that OP and their kid are dark skinned and associating that with them being black. There is nothing negative or discriminatory about that. Of course it is possible that they are of a different ethnicity that also has dark skin but that doesn't really matter as the issue here is discriminating against this child and not allowing them sunscreen. It makes no difference if the kid is Hispanic, native, middle eastern, African or of any other dark skinned ethnicity, the problem remains the same.", "\"Some people think dark skin can't burn.\"\n\nI misread, OP said dark skin. However, it changes nothing. That parent was still in the wrong.", "It was an impromptu beach trip they weren\u2019t planning on going to the beach. OP said they did not know that the kid was going to be taken to the beach. Get some reading comprehension skills.", "Just assumed because it\u2019s middle of summer boys would be boys and be outside. Maybe my pov is skewed because I live 2 miles from coast, but anytime I\u2019m watching nephews who are same age, they come with a yeti for water and sunscreen. When leaving the house, sunscreen check is just part of life.", "And that kid just lost a friend, so who was really punished here", "You know what the \u201c\u201d\u201d\u201d marks mean, right?", "They put it in quotes as they were repeating what OP said - this wasn\u2019t their view. Bloody hell.", "> I don't assume evrrybody with dark skin is black,\n\n> The assumption of them having dark skin is all that is necessary,", "Are you really saying you would want your kid to go to this person\u2019s house again or be in that woman\u2019s care? Sometimes kids lose friends bc the friend\u2019s parent is racist and harms your child. It sucks, but that\u2019s life.", "You think dark and black mean the same thing?\n\nYoure literally hopeless"]}
