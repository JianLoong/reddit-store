This was an issue of common sense and basic logic, that the colour of human skin does not make someone fundamentally LESS HUMAN or a different kind of human being . . . that's a trope that goes back centuries (millennia?) and feeds into the kind of racism where even doctors were taught that Black people had \"thicker skin\" and \"didn't feel pain the same way\".\n\nPut bluntly: your son's friend's mother was racist AF and risked your son's immediate health and well-being because of her fundamentally racist beliefs (he could have ended up in terrible pain if he'd gotten sunburned). She treated him differently (and worse) than all of the other children in her care, when you trusted her to be the adult responsible for him, even after he specifically came out and asked her to treat him the same (BTW, that was her learning moment, if your wife was concerned; your son basically TOLD her . . . this child KNEW that he needed sunscreen and she still refused). \n\nYou are NTA in every way. She deserved to be called out, and being openly racist to a small child in your care does not warrant a response of kindness or gentleness from that child's parents.  She needed her racism to be named for what it was, and if she felt hurt or shaken up by your accusations, then good . . . she should feel bad for what she did.", "NTA. She's ignorant and neglecting your child because of it. He even asked for sunscreen and she ignored him, assuming she knows his body better than she does.

It would have taken so little of kindness to go, \"Here you go honey, let me know if you need help with your back\" like Any. Other. Child. but instead she refused?? That is some next level meanness just for refusing a few drops of protection to one of the kids. That makes her the AH and you the protector, imho.\n\nIt was a teachable moment, but you shouldn't need to be the teacher. Kindness and care for children in your temporary custody is supposed to be a given. Did you need to attack and name-call? Not really, but we see why you were upset. It was like .20cents worth of sunscreen ffs, so even with her stupidity she doesn't really have an excuse.\n\nEDITED to add: It would have been an N A H if that mom had apologized and said she didn't realize but would know for next time, but instead she decided to double down and then blame OP for not being psychic to know her child would need sunscreen for an unplanned beach trip.", "NTA at all, and for the Y T A and E S H votes\u2026\u2026look. I\u2019m white too. I grew up with the assumption that people with darker skin than mine didn\u2019t burn as easily as me, and never really had reason to question it.

She assumed she knew more than your son about his own skincare. \n\nThis all comes back to this parent treating your child differently because of skin color.\n\nWhen faced with that reality this parent didn\u2019t apologize.

Delayed diagnosis is multi-faceted, and stems from things like a lack of education about the risks to the affected population, a lack of awareness and vigilance among practitioners, and diminished access to preventive healthcare.
