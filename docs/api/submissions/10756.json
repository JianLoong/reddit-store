My guess is she was picturing herself as pregnant and so when she heard \"inherently repulsive\" it felt like a personal insult.\n\n  \nYou probably could have had better emotional awareness of where she was coming from, but she didn't have to take it personally.

My mom\u2019s doc(an older retired army doc) told her none of this, only after she got to the hospital and it was confirmed by x-ray that I was breech did the doc tell her that she\u2019d have a c-section at 5pm after he closed the office. Except at 2:15 pm, I decided I wasn\u2019t going to wait, but the nurses didn\u2019t believe my mom when she said I was coming, ready or not, leading to the nurses screaming to \u201dget Dr Pat here g\\*\\*damn now!\u201d and my mom on a gurney being run down the hall to the OR, lower half uncovered, with a nurse on the gurney kneeling between her legs holding my butt in with one hand and dry shaving mom with the other. They did a fast epidural but when they started the c-section, it hadn\u2019t kicked in so they just held her down, the doc numbing her with local lidocaine as he was cutting, and she was cursing a blue streak while trying to hold still. Then, when I\u2019m taken to the nursery, because my hips were dislocated, I was still folded in half(had to wear diapers and casts to correct this). The nurse unfolds my legs from my face to measure me, can\u2019t reach her pencil, let\u2019s go of my legs momentarily and they flop back up into my face causing me to scream-all while my family is watching.  (My dad was apparently so relieved and tired at this point that he started laughing until he was literally weak in the knees and collapsed in the hallway, laughing until he was in tears) Of course, I\u2019ve been told these stories a million times. Fast forward to the 1990\u2019s, I\u2019m 17 and in nursing school OB clinicals in the exact hospital and the story of my mom/my birth ends up being told as a \u201cwhat not to do\u201d, pay attention to your patient, believe them when they say baby\u2019s coming, even if there are no signs. I say nothing, though I know it\u2019s me. During the same clinical rotation, we go to the newborn nursery and an older nurse starts telling the story of measuring this baby, that she let the legs flop up, and to be careful with babies, especially when family is watching. i Still don\u2019t say anything, but a few minutes later, my old pediatrician (who is a family friend) comes into the nursery, sees me, drags me over to the older nurse saying \u201cremember the baby with the bilateral dislocated hips you always talk about? This is her, she\u2019s all grown up now!\u201d.  Well, apparently my OB nursing instructor had also been one of the nurses who cared for me, and over the 6 weeks of OB clinicals, I met a lot of retired nurses who had taken care of mom and me.
