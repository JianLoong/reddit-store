My guess is she was picturing herself as pregnant and so when she heard \"inherently repulsive\" it felt like a personal insult.\n\n  \nYou probably could have had better emotional awareness of where she was coming from, but she didn't have to take it personally.

Get sterilized it was the best thing I ever did", "NTA . Your sister needs to get her head together. Pregnancy aesthetic is literally one of the dumbest things I\u2019ve ever heard of. Pregnancy last for 9 months. Followed by a life time of self sacrifice, financial difficulty, struggles with mental and physical relationships. Having a child is not about the aesthetic of looking pregnant. Honestly your sister needs a wake up call and grow up. Just get her to buy a fake pregnancy tummy.", "NTA, but maybe she is pregnant, and that's why she is a little upset, maybe she was trying to tell you?", "NTA. Your sister is in for quite the shock. It is a huge mistake to think of pregnancy as an aesthetic. Seriously, wtf. Also, \"serene\"? SERENE? The incredible hormonal odyssey that makes people cry over commercials is not serene. \n\nThe anxiety. The weepiness. The mucus. The nausea. The gas. The leg cramps that literally woke me screaming. The day I ate one cracker and threw up twice. The time my toddler showed my sister that they understood the potty was for barfing in (\"I see you're having some morning sickness,\" she said, as my cherubic underfoot baby made hideous vomity noises, \"and potty training is going pretty much nowhere?\")\n\nI guess I also had some nice maternity sweaters, but SERIOUSLY?", "I don't think your sister was speaking hypothetically.\n\nYou have every right to your opinion but telling your sister who wants to start a family that \"*pregnancy is repulsive\"* this is kinda too far.

I\u2019m a 30 year old woman and I\u2019ve been really repulsed by the idea of pregnancy for as long as I can remember.

I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so grossed out by the process, or even the thought of carrying something alive inside of me, but I am.

You didn\u2019t call her repulsive, just shared your opinion. I\u2019ve been pregnant twice and the majority of the time it was anything but beautiful and serene.

My children are an absolute blessing but pregnancy was just something I had to get through.", "NTA. Pregnancy IS inherently repulsive.", "NTA and same.", "You're NTA. You stated an opinion that she didn't agree with. It happens. But with her overreaction, are you sure she wasn't leading in to a conversation where she announces that she is pregnant? She sure did take it personally.", "YTA, not for how you feel but how you basically told her you think she'd be disgusting if she got pregnant and that you think something she finds beautiful is disgusting. \n\nYou don't have to agree with her but replying to someone that they are wrong is rude.", "INFO: \n\nOP are you a man or women? \n\nHave you been through pregnancy yourself (or has your partner)?", "NTA.

I don\u2019t think hers is wrong. \n\nThis would be n a h except she got mad for you voicing your opinion sooo NTA.", "NTA and I feel similarly.

Bless the mothers who go through pregnancy but it's never been anything that appealed to me.", "NTA you expressed an opinion after hearing hers. That\u2019s how conversations go. Personally I think you might have hit a nerve because she\u2019s either currently trying to get pregnant or she is only a few weeks along and you burst her bubble. I think there are so many young women who think that getting pregnant is going to make their lives better and it\u2019s going to be a walk in the park. And for some that is the case but your take on it is also true. I think you might want to try to causally mention being excited to be an aunt in the future and how amazing it\u2019ll be that she wants to be a mom.", "NTA but I loved my pregnancy. I had gestational diabetes, so I had to be super careful about my diet. It wasn't a perfect pregnancy but I had never in my life felt so beautiful or accepting of my body as I did while pregnant.", "NTA. I have had four kids. Hopefully, whenever your sister has kids, it is everything the aesthetic has hyped it up to be for her. She would not appreciate a conversation with me, lol. You were both giving opinions.", "NTA, you just have a different opinion than her and she\u2019s mad about it lol. I agree with you btw, the whole thing seems gross to me and I never plan on having biological children.", "NTA. I\u2019m 36 weeks right now and your description honestly made me laugh. Don\u2019t see how it\u2019s disrespectful in the slightest.", "NTA. There\u2019s nothing wrong with sharing your thoughts and opinions on pregnancy. I actually completely sympathize with you on this. A lot of people look at pregnancy with rose colored glasses and think it\u2019s just a beautiful miracle. When in reality it\u2019s nasty and hormonal and just not an all-around smooth experience for most women. I think it\u2019s perfectly okay to admit and point out the nitty-gritty aspects of pregnancy. Your sister may have to find out the hard way herself though.", "Pregnancy has a history of being culturally taboo as has menstruation, despite the fact that both are natural and therefore have no inherently shameful qualities as well as the fact that both are utterly essential for the continuation of the human species.\n\nYour sister is trying to embrace pregnancy and the natural beauty that can absolutely be found in pregnant women. And you called pregnancy repulsive. \n\nI hope you are a republican-voting male because at least then your attitude would be expected. YTA", "Ugh. I hated being pregnant. What the heck is \"pregnant mom aesthetic\"?\n\nNTA. You didn't say that pregnant women are repulsive, just the idea of being pregnant is. She might just want someone to mirror her or praise her.", "NTA, your sister is delusional. Mom of 2 here and serene is never the way I'd describe being pregnant lmao", "Yes, YTA.", "NTA. She\u2019s not pregnant as far as you know. If she were, that would have been insensitive, but she\u2019s not. Some people really are out off by pregnancy. You\u2019re allowed your opinion.", "NTA and your sister is in for a very rude awakening. Pregnancy can be a joy, but it\u2019s also dang hard, and there\u2019s not much aesthetically pleasing about it. IG influencers succeed by creating fictional worlds just like fantasy writers do. And really, a herd of unicorns and pegasi would be more realistic than most of the crap influencers peddle.", "She shouldn\u2019t punish you or bully you for having an opinion.\n\nWhat an immature thing for her to do. Pretty ironic and actually worrying for someone who is planning to be a mother \n\nYou are NTA", "NTA. \"Serene and appealing\", my left buttcheek.

In my eyes, this question being appropriate hinges on that. As a woman, I also find pregnancy repulsive - it is such a body horror to me, your body not being fully your own, the physical and hormonal changes over such a short period - it horrifies me a little bit. I do want kids today, which means I will probably suffer through it eventually, but I always joke that if I were a man I\u2019d want biological kids fire sure but as a woman the idea isn\u2019t quite as appealing. But, I would be somewhat perturbed if a man were to say this to me. Maybe that\u2019s just personal to me, but I\u2019d be really thrown off at implying he thinks pregnant women are disgusting, because while pregnancy disgusts me for the changes my body would undergo, to him it would read as he just finds pregnant women disgusting. \n\nI think maybe the comment wasn\u2019t malicious, but I could see why your sister is upset by it.", "If your sister wants an echo chamber she can find it in mom groups on facebook, but in a discussion about life goals she's going to get wildly distinct interests and pursuits.

I wouldn\u2019t go as far as repulsive... however I don\u2019t recall ever achieving the serene & appealing stage LOL. \n\nI do recall our oldest (4 & 2 at the time) helping me get my shoes on when I was pregnant for our twins... because I couldn\u2019t see or reach my feet after 30 weeks.
