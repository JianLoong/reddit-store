My guess is she was picturing herself as pregnant and so when she heard \"inherently repulsive\" it felt like a personal insult.\n\n  \nYou probably could have had better emotional awareness of where she was coming from, but she didn't have to take it personally.

Is thinking pregnancy is an aesthetic weird. Yes. \n\nThere's still nothing wrong with not being interested in pregnancy.", "Person studying medicine in this current moment there is nothing serene about pregnancy. It looks like a shit show. First trimester is  fatigue, Nausea and vomiting, bloating, Breast tenderness.\n\nThe second trimester is nausea vomiting, pelvic pain, round ligament pain, Quickening, itchy vagina, restless leg syndrome, Breast enlargement\uff0cchanges in bowel habits, emotional lability and Braxton Hicks.\n\nThe third trimester is Extreme fatigue, heat intolerance, difficulty breathing due to the position off the uterus, urinary frequency, inability to get comfortable at night, restless legs, Edema, leg cramps, constipation, etc.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget birth, postpartum mastitis, postpartum depression, postpartum psychosis, postpartum contractions, fatigue, emotional ability, etc\n\nThere is nothing serene about Christmas.

She was on bed rest for most of it due to the fluid.", "NTA. As a woman I am TERRIFIED of being pregnant. It sounds terrible. And I like kids and I love the idea of having a family. But the process? It is so punk rock and absolutely crazy human bodies can do that, but it certainly doesn\u2019t sound comfy. where did she get the idea it is a \u201cserene\u201d aesthetic? Also my mom loved being pregnant so it\u2019s not like I grew up hearing it\u2019s a bad time.  It\u2019s almost weirder to me that she is talking about pregnancy as an \u201caesthetic\u201d", "NTA babies are parasites growing inside u no thank u", "The heartburn that hasn't gone away in 20+ yrs?

I don\u2019t even get serenity in my sleep. I\u2019ve had quite an uneventful pregnancy at that. I\u2019ve had one aesthetically appealing experience in my whole past 9 months & it was dressing up for my baby shower which literally took the life out of me to get dolled up for.

Lol, I\u2019m with you - I find it both repulsive and barbaric. And I say this as someone trying to have a child!", "NTA, and I agree with you. I always wanted to adopt, and one of the many reasons for that is that pregnancy sounds truly awful. As it happened, I couldn't be pregnant even if I wanted to be, so it was a good thing that I never wanted to be pregnant in the first place.", "NTA.  You are entitled to your opinion, even if it conflicts with your sister idealized take on pregnancy.", "NTA - your sister has no idea what being pregnant is really like. The influencers make it look glamorous but the reality is your bladder will have the Mexican hat dance done on it all the time. Sciatic nerve pains. And at the end the non stop heart burn.

I\u2019m currently pregnant and last weekend while driving to my in laws I threw up and peed myself twice in a 60 minute time period. Pregnancy can be repulsive. And it certainly isn\u2019t serene.", "NTA-you were really just stating your opinion, it's not wrong to think of pregnancy as something that can be repulsive, it's really just the truth when you look at it from a point of view that's not fogged with lies and deception and over-sugared views on it from outside opinions because people have demonized NOT thinking pregnancy is this beautiful, easy, serene, perfect miracle.", "NTA.

Hell, you even did the exact opposite of minimizing others' struggles, so even if you're wrong you're not being a dick to anyone. NTA.", "NAH. Pregnancy honestly seems repulsive and miserable. I say this as someone who is actively trying to get pregnant. I\u2019m sure there will be good parts (and who knows, maybe I\u2019ll be lucky and LOVE pregnancy like my grandmother did), but so much of it seems very much about hormones and bodily fluids. \n\nThat said, don\u2019t say anything like that to your sister once she is actually pregnant.

My sister needed vaginal stiches.", "NTA. And tell your sister thanks for the laughs. Like many other Mom's, my legs were crossed. But damn, those prego photo Instagram pics are leaving a false ideal of pregnancy on people like your sister.

Maybe that will bring her back to reality.", "NTA and you're absolutely right. It's repulsive and uncomfortable and hilariously awkward. I don't recall serenity crossing my mind as a way to describe how I felt at any point in my pregnancies.", "I've never been pregnant but OPs sisters idea of pregnancy reminded me when my office mate was pregnant and it was a hot day. I was minding my own business working when she jumped up and started screeching about the heat and how she could not take it anymore. \n\nThen she grabbed some scissors and made me cut her pants into shorts.", "I\u2019m laughing way too hard too! The \u201caesthetic\u201d combined with the chastising \u201cdon\u2019t talk about things you don\u2019t understand\u201d. The girl is clueless. Pregnancy is beautiful and amazing - but you basically become a mutant and it\u2019s painful and definitely a humility inducing experience.

I didn\u2019t find pregnancy so \u201cserene\u201d either when I was puking my guts out into a travel mug because it was the only thing I had in the car.

I, on the other hand, did not--at all.  I love my kids, though.\n\nJust one note: there is such a thing as Pelvic PT/pelvic floor rehabilitation.

Yup! I found Vomiting while peeing yourself incredibly serene.", "Serene... HAHAHA HAHA HAHA HA!!!!!!", "Girl, deep core exercises. I used to pee when I sneezed and then saw a specialist.
