We get to see most women survive pregnancy. We also get to raise most of our children to adulthood. These are unimaginable luxuries in many parts of the world. I have lived in those places.

It was celebrated, and survival of mother and child was even more so.\n\nHow fortunate are we?\n\nOP, I can't really say NTA, because I think you were insensitive and betrayed a gross lack of curiosity, respect and education.

She needs to accept not everyone thinks it\u2019s some special thing.", "nta \n\nSo it's okay for her to express her opinion but you can't express yours?", "NTA. My guess is she was picturing herself as pregnant and so when she heard \"inherently repulsive\" it felt like a personal insult.\n\n  \nYou probably could have had better emotional awareness of where she was coming from, but she didn't have to take it personally. The only asshole move here is her still harping on the event ***after you apologized***. Shit happens.

Not even a little. \n\nI\u2019m a mom of two (soon to be three) and I was a surrogate. Bringing life into the world is very rewarding, it can also really really really suck.

Sure. But it was nothing horrible or wrong. I hate pregnancy, the concept, the visual, all of it.

Just because \u201cphobia\u201d happens to be in the word? It doesn\u2019t mean \u201cphobia\u201d is always just a fear (see homophobia).

No. \n\nIt is absolutely fine to be repulsed by something even if a mental health condition isn\u2019t involved and isn\u2019t anything to do with being a jerk.\n\nPeople are allowed personal opinions about something. What is a jerk move is to shame them for having a personal opinion that you personally don\u2019t think should be said when their disgust of pregnancy literally doesn\u2019t affect anyone. \n\nIt is not a jerk move at all, ever, to voice discomfort about something unless your discomfort is based on preconceived bias in regards to someone. The OP quite clearly thinks that being pregnant is repulsive and he is glad he will never have to feel what it is like to be pregnant. He has said nothing wrong by stating he is relieved he won\u2019t have to ever go through pregnancy."]}
