They carpooled in my car and I bought and packed a lunch that we all shared. We each bought our own ticket; my 2 year old daughter's was free. While we were there, we visited the jousting tournament. One of the friends asked my daughter (not me) if she wanted a flag to wave. DD said yes and she asked her which one. I suggested she take DD over the the aisle to meet the flag vendor and pick her flag. After DD selected her flag, the friend, without any hesitation, turned to me and asked if I was going to pay for it. I was a bit taken back and only answered a stunned \"no.\" I had planned to buy DD a nice keepsake, but something nicer than a cheap, overpriced flag. As a financially struggling, single mother, I can't afford to buy her everything and if I wanted to buy her a flag, I would have broached the subject myself. I felt that her offering the flag to my daughter without saying anything to me about it beforehand, was her offering to buy it for her.

It was definitely implied that your friend was treating your daughter to the flag. Otherwise, she should have told you how much they were and made sure that was okay by you first.", "Also - I'd have said, \"Just go ahead and take it out of your share of the gas money you are going to pay me for driving your cheap ass here.\"", "NTA\n\nWhy did she ask if she wasn't going to pay it herself? If you wanted to buy it for your daughter, you would have told the daughter yourself.\n\nWhat an unnecessary thing to do!", "NTA - nobody should volunteer another person buy something when they have no idea of their financial situation.\n\n*edited because I put \u2018but\u2019 instead of \u2018buy\u2019", "Your friend put you in a shitty position and should have bought it for the kid. I\u2019ll never understand why people pull moves like that. NTA.", "NTA! If you offer something to a child without consulting the parent first, you are also offering to pay for it. Your friend is an adult and should know these things.", "It's okay to decline an offer for something you didn't plan to purchase in the first place, especially if you have financial obligations to consider. You handled the situation the best way you could in the moment, and there's no need to feel guilty or wrong for your actions.", "NTA. \n\nNo, you weren\u2019t wrong. That is extremely rude and peculiar behavior on your friend\u2019s part. She basically said that she was going to pay for the flag, despite not being explicit. That\u2019s what\u2019s implied when you ask someone if they want something.", "I'm going with NTA on this one. I mean, I can kind of see the friend's point since you did suggest she take your daughter over to see them, but still - she is the one who suggested it - to your daughter, none the less, not you.", "NTA - with kids I always ask parents or guardians first before buying or offering them anything. It\u2019s a holdover from my childcare days I suppose.", "NTA. If friend offered, friend should have paid instead of volunteering your money.", "NTA. She offered the flag - she needs to pay for it. It doesn't make sense any other way. Why would she think YOU wanted to pay for something SHE offered?", "Your freind is a giant asshole.  Its like toddler 101... you do not dangle something shiny in front of them and then take it away like that.  It clearly sounded like she was planning on buying the flag for your kiddo and when she expected you too, thats when she became the asshole", "NTA\n\nAnd just to add I have seen similar posts like this where a generous purchase is made and \u2018gifted\u2019 then the buyer asks for reimbursement AFTERWARDS having not made their expectations clear prior to purchasing! \n\nAlso, you drove (so picked up all the transportation costs) and packed a lunch for everyone too? Yeah, definitely NTA. It is ridiculous to me that the purchaser expects to get all the \u2018glory/thanks/appreciation from your daughter as the person that \u2018bought\u2019 her the flag, and then expects you to foot the bill!", "NTA, You were forcefully put in a spotlight by that friend and that's unfair to you especially while you are taking care of a child by yourself. That's just uncalled for to put you in that position. Also very rude to expect someone to just pay for something when they have no idea how you're doing money wise", "NTA your friend sure made that awkward.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
