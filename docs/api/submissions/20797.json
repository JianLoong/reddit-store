{"id": 20797, "submission_id": "14l5hrg", "title": "WIBTA for declining my GF's brother's request to sleep over in our apartment?", "selftext": "I live with my girlfriend in a 530 square feet (50 sqm) apartment consisting of a small bedroom, a tiny bathroom, a small kitchen and one big living room.\n\nFor the past few years or so, my girlfriend's brother has been visiting the city, and has been asking if he can sleep on our couch. To begin with, it happened very infrequently and was usually one night during the weekend. Lately it has become more and more frequent and he stays over for multiple days, and often during the weekdays.\n\nIt's an apartment that I own, so my girlfriend always asks if I'm okay with him sleeping over, which I have been okay with up to now.\n\nThe thing is, the apartment is so small, that when he is sleeping in the living room, he is basically using up our entire living space. We usually spend most of our time in the living room, since it's the only room in the apartment that has the space. We watch TV in the living room, play computer games in the living room, work in the living room and eat in the living room. \n\nBefore going to sleep at night, I bring a lot of stuff from the living room into the bedroom, to ensure that I won't have to use the living room before he gets up the next day. I usually work from home and I wake up super early and he sleeps until late. This means I have been eating my breakfast standing up in the kitchen, and sitting in my bed with my laptop working. If I forget something in the living room, I have to walk on toes while trying to find it, while he's sleeping on the couch. Once he gets up, I move into the living room to my desktop, but I can never work in privacy because he's in there the entire day.\n\nIt's important to note, that I like my brother in law, and it's not him being annoying, but it's just the fact that the apartment is so small that I have to sacrifice so much of my personal space for him to stay over. I could probably just bust into the living room at 5 AM and begin working, and he wouldn't complain, but I don't feel comfortable doing that. If we had a spare room I would have no problem with him staying over.\n\nWIBTA for declining his request to stay over during the weekdays, simply for the reasons stated above? I can't think of any reason to give him, other than the fact that I think it's bothersome to be 3 people in such a small apartment while having to juggle in work.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1687947002, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14l5hrg/wibta_for_declining_my_gfs_brothers_request_to/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I hope your BIL understands id not, oh well. You need that space.", "NTA \n\nc'mon it is small, been on both ends of the deal (guest in a tiny apartment and host in a tiny apartment ) and it can get positively cramped very quickly, so you have every right to refuse the inconvenience. You can also make a rule of sorts - just on out of work days , just 1night maximum etc...", "YWNBTA and I get your reasons. I am curious as to why he is there so much.", "NTA \nAs you've said its a small apartment and it's an inconvenience to you while he stays overnight. \n\nNext time he asks tell him that seeing as he's staying over on a regular basis it's time for him to contribute to the water and electricity bills,or a general flat rate for overnight stays. \n\nHopefully that should stop him from wanting to stay over.", "NTA. \n\nBased on what you said, both your gf and her brother sound like nice people, why not just have an honest conversation about this? The reasons you listed aren't unreasonable at all. If they don't understand it, then I guess that increases your motivation to decline their requests.\n\nYou're also not completely preventing him from coming, just not when the stay is going to be a couple of days and not just a day or two, based on what I understand.", "NTA\n\nOnce or twice a year, more than that it's pretty rude of him tbh.", "NTA. \n\nIs there a reason he's staying over so frequently? \n\nThe negative impact its having on your ability to work is reason enough to decline requests that arent weekends although I wonder if you'll then end up losing your living room Friday through Sunday more often.\n\nI hope he's mature enough to understand its not him specifically thats an issue, its losing the majority of your usuable living space whenever he visits. \n\nShould this turn into an issue... I would just start busting into the living room at 5AM regardless of him sleeping there and make yourself some nice loud breakfast and type some long emails. Might change his mind about future visits.", "NTA.", "My apartment is the exact same size! \n\nI wouldn\u2019t even want to add a significant other to this space. It\u2019s *perfect* for me but not big enough for 2 people, never mind 3, in my mind.\n\nNTA.", "NTA having your work/relax day interupted and having to work in a small room sucks.  Have you thought about talking to your gf so both of you sit down with the brother and tell him he is welcome, but your day starts at x time and you need the space?", ">It's an apartment that I own, so my girlfriend always asks if I'm okay with him sleeping over, which I have been okay with up to now.\n\nY T A for this. Your GF asks cause you both live there and you should ask her if any of your family wants to crash on your couch.\n\nHowever, NTA in this particular scenario. It's perfectly fine to ask her brother to rent a place if he is going to be in your city so often", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

His name may be on the lease, but she lives there full time too, and doesn't deserve to have her family time reduced to such a little amount of time. I agree he may be staying too often AND too long, but having sparse long visits or frequent short visits is not only acceptable, but expected imo."]}
