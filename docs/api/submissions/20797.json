To begin with, it happened very infrequently and was usually one night during the weekend. Lately it has become more and more frequent and he stays over for multiple days, and often during the weekdays.\n\nIt's an apartment that I own, so my girlfriend always asks if I'm okay with him sleeping over, which I have been okay with up to now.\n\nThe thing is, the apartment is so small, that when he is sleeping in the living room, he is basically using up our entire living space. We usually spend most of our time in the living room, since it's the only room in the apartment that has the space. We watch TV in the living room, play computer games in the living room, work in the living room and eat in the living room. \n\nBefore going to sleep at night, I bring a lot of stuff from the living room into the bedroom, to ensure that I won't have to use the living room before he gets up the next day. I usually work from home and I wake up super early and he sleeps until late. This means I have been eating my breakfast standing up in the kitchen, and sitting in my bed with my laptop working. If I forget something in the living room, I have to walk on toes while trying to find it, while he's sleeping on the couch. Once he gets up, I move into the living room to my desktop, but I can never work in privacy because he's in there the entire day.\n\nIt's important to note, that I like my brother in law, and it's not him being annoying, but it's just the fact that the apartment is so small that I have to sacrifice so much of my personal space for him to stay over. I could probably just bust into the living room at 5 AM and begin working, and he wouldn't complain, but I don't feel comfortable doing that. If we had a spare room I would have no problem with him staying over.\n\nWIBTA for declining his request to stay over during the weekdays, simply for the reasons stated above? I can't think of any reason to give him, other than the fact that I think it's bothersome to be 3 people in such a small apartment while having to juggle in work.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1687947002, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14l5hrg/wibta_for_declining_my_gfs_brothers_request_to/", "score": 176, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think saying 1 night max, weekends only is fine.", "You're NTA for not wanting him over so much.\n\nBut how you approach these situations needs work. Agreeing on having guests shouldn't be a matter of who owns the apartment, it should be a question of respect for everyone who lives in the apartment.

I think based on the replies to this post, I will probably just lay it out like it is, and tell him that it creates too much of a conflict with my working schedule. I was just wondering whether I would come off as rude for not letting him stay over, since we are the only family he has in this city, and his only other option is to pay for a hotel.\n\nSome people are like do or die when it comes to family, but I've never really been a family type of person, so I didn't know what the norm was in these types of situations.", "Thanks for your response.

It's not that it is a particularly big issue if I decline, but I was just wondering whether it would be considered rude not to let him stay over. \n\n> Is there a reason he's staying over so frequently?\n\nIt's just mainly to visit some friends.

Reading my post again, I can see why you say that. I have been together with my girlfriend for 5 years, and we have lived together for 3 years.

Also,\n\n>Big difference between visiting and staying with.\n\nNot really when it's just one night's sleep and one or two days of hanging out imo.

Whenever he came on weekends he had a place to stay because his friends didn\u2019t mind hosting him on the weekends. \n\nBut during the week? Most didn\u2019t want to fully host him since they had work the next morning or their GF/wife had to work (or they lived at home and their parents wouldn\u2019t allow it).

This is AITA, not \"Am I legally in the right\" I don't give a damn about his justifications, unless the brother makes a clear cause for removing, OP WBTA if he acted like a dictator. He needs to sit down and talk with her, and stop asking reddit if he should actively participate in the most healthy thing you can do in a relationship, fucking communicate.
