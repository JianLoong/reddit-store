All I did was bring the view point that her sister is probably just doing it out of instinct. If you don't wanna give her any type of consideration for that, that is your right.\n\nI feel like every time I say NAH everyone thinks it immediately conflicts with their N TA. Like I agree with almost everyone, but I don't think the other person should be blamed for something that is most likely just natural for them.", "Point taken and I thank you for your reply."]}
