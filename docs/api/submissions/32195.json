I then told her all about it, all the new things I\u2019m learning, how much fun I\u2019m having, and so many other exciting things, when she told me that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand why I didn\u2019t pick pilates instead of yoga, given that it doesn\u2019t align with our spiritual beliefs\u201d I was quite frankly caught of guard as I did not ask for her opinion nor have I asked her for a single dime to help pay for the training ( which is surprisingly expensive) I just told her that ever since I started doing yoga, I\u2019ve learned so much about my nervous system and how to regulate it. She was about to argue with me when my phone rang (THANK GOD!) \nThis wouldn\u2019t really bother me if it was an isolated incident. My sister has a very long history of trying to impose her belief systems on the rest of us. \n\nI first broke the news to my parents about my new job offer, my dad was beyond excited and my mom soon asked me when am I going to tell my sister. I told her the above \u201cpilates\u201d situation. My mom agreed that she was wrong but still urged me to be the bigger person and just tell her the exciting news. I refused. \n\nI\u2019m guessing my mom told her because just yesterday my sister said \u201cI heard you got a new job\u201d I replied \u201cYes, I did\u201d. \nShe then says \u201cBIL and I were quite hurt when you didn\u2019t share the news with us\u201d \nI then responded with \u201cI did not want you to breathe sanctimony and doubt all over my happy moment\u201d \nShe asked me what I meant, and I referred to the same situation I told my mom about. I told her that her advice wasn\u2019t helpful at all and all she was trying to do was make me feel guilty and doubtful about what I was doing. \nShe said \u201cI\u2019m you sister, it is my duty to guide you and advise you when i fear you are going down the wrong path\u201d \nI told her that \u201cno one asked for your unsolicited advice, you are not my parent, my pastor nor someone who\u2019s opinions I actually value. So keep your nasty opinions to yourself.\u201d \nShe then told me that it is \u201cher right to voice her opinion and boundaries about what she feels is right and wrong\u201d \nI told her that she has every right to her opinion and to live her life as she sees fit but she has no right to tell me how to live my life. \nShe walked away quite angry and left shortly after. \nMy mom thinks I\u2019m an asshole because she believes I blew the situation way out of proportion and accused me of being vindictive and punitive. She agrees that my sister was initially wrong but I\u2019m being far too sensitive and making it a bigger issue than what it was. \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701530989, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18963jk/aita_for_not_telling_my_entitled_sister_that_i/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Besides that, Yoga goes against your spiritual belief? Is that even a proper statement? Stand your ground and keep improving, congratulation for your job btw.", "NTA. You handled this swimmingly. Your sister needs to keep her unsolicited opinions about your life choices to herself, especially when they\u2019re negative.
