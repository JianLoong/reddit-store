I then told her all about it, all the new things I\u2019m learning, how much fun I\u2019m having, and so many other exciting things, when she told me that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand why I didn\u2019t pick pilates instead of yoga, given that it doesn\u2019t align with our spiritual beliefs\u201d I was quite frankly caught of guard as I did not ask for her opinion nor have I asked her for a single dime to help pay for the training ( which is surprisingly expensive) I just told her that ever since I started doing yoga, I\u2019ve learned so much about my nervous system and how to regulate it. She was about to argue with me when my phone rang (THANK GOD!) \nThis wouldn\u2019t really bother me if it was an isolated incident. My sister has a very long history of trying to impose her belief systems on the rest of us. \n\nI first broke the news to my parents about my new job offer, my dad was beyond excited and my mom soon asked me when am I going to tell my sister.

I refused. \n\nI\u2019m guessing my mom told her because just yesterday my sister said \u201cI heard you got a new job\u201d I replied \u201cYes, I did\u201d. \nShe then says \u201cBIL and I were quite hurt when you didn\u2019t share the news with us\u201d \nI then responded with \u201cI did not want you to breathe sanctimony and doubt all over my happy moment\u201d \nShe asked me what I meant, and I referred to the same situation I told my mom about.

So keep your nasty opinions to yourself.\u201d \nShe then told me that it is \u201cher right to voice her opinion and boundaries about what she feels is right and wrong\u201d \nI told her that she has every right to her opinion and to live her life as she sees fit but she has no right to tell me how to live my life. \nShe walked away quite angry and left shortly after. \nMy mom thinks I\u2019m an asshole because she believes I blew the situation way out of proportion and accused me of being vindictive and punitive.

Mom needs to grow a backbone.", "NTA... but I don't know why you even pretend to listen to a word she says or give her any credence. If she starts spewing stuff at you just give her a \"uh huh\"  and walk away.", "As there's 12 years between your ages, I cannot imagine you are too close.\n\nYNTA, but I wouldn't engage much if I could avoid it.\n\nCongrats on your new job!", "NTA\n\nAnd congratulations on the new job.", "\nNTA.

You were excited about yoga and your sister decided to try and harsh your buzz.", "NTA. This is not just about this one situation, it is about a toxic pattern of behavior. You made a boundary with your sister, you made it clear what you expect from her. She can voice her opinions, but you do not have to listen, you do not have to even talk to her if she decides her opinions are more important than a relationship with you.\n\nMy sister was much like this even though there is only a year and a half difference in our ages. In her mind I will perpetually be a stupid young kid despite evidence to the contrary. For context, she just turned 60. I don't talk to her anymore, and my life is pretty damn good because of it.", "I like your mum, she's a sensible person. Yes your sister should have kept her opinions to herself, but omg why do you need to be a drama llama about the issue. As a practitioner on Yoga myself when I was younger (and had free time) I know this is not the behaviour yoga condones. This is the definition of mountain out of a mile hill.", "Not you but your sister is a complete and total A-Hole !  Forget her and live your life the best you can, who needs a black hole like her around ?", "NTA.  If anything, you should firmly tell your sister that she is really crossing your boundaries.  She was misusing boundaries, as boundaries are not forcing your input on others or forcing them to make decisions you want them to.", "I believe some of the whack-a-doo strains of Evangelical Christianity think that yoga is devil worship or something else ridiculous like that.", "I think yoga is Hindu and some evangelical Christians consider it \"pagan\"", "Did you read the same post I did??", "Holly crap! That's crazy as hell.", "Yes, but why does OP care if her sister doesn't support her Yoga. Why would that bother anyone it's such a minor non event. Caring or allowing such trivial things to effect you is not aligned with the practice of yoga at all. Drama over nothing."]}
