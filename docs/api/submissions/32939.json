Big red flags here.", "INFO\n\nI'm a little confused because at the start of your post you said \"I don't care about presents **or cards**\" and then later you said you were really looking forward to the card from your husband because they are always so sweet. So apparently you do care about cards at least if they are from your husband. Have you made it clear to him (before this incident) that while you don't care about gifts, a thoughtful card is in fact important to you? It might seem obvious that \"he should just know that\" especially since his cards are usually more thoughtful, but since you said earlier you don't care about cards, I'm confused about whether he actually knew how important his usual cards are to you. Do you get him nice cards with a well-thought out message written inside for his birthday? \n\nIt's also confusing because you said he followed you upstairs and said he knew you'd be depressed which makes it seem like he at least suspected that you might not like the card. Honestly, I don't know how to judge this. The whole situation is confusing to me. It sounds like some kind of communication issue between the two of you.", "INFO\n\nIf I asked him how you treat him, what do you think he'd say?", "NTA. Seems clear to me he did this specifically to make you upset, or else he wouldn't tell you he knew in advance and give you a \"so??\" when you told him the problem. So the question is why is he hurting you on purpose? What's he trying to achieve? If you're giving him a pass because his dad died three years ago, sorry to say, but that sounds a bit naive. You can't keep explaining his actions with his dad's death - even if he's still grieving, hurting his spouse on purpose and/or removing all effort from your relationship isn't part of that process. And I say that as someone who was crushed when my dad died.", "YTA\n\nYou don't \"do\" the gifts and card giving thing because you don't like to go to any trouble for others, and you're having a fit because your husband didn't give you the sort of card you've come to expect from him.

Although his message and his reaction to your reaction, could point to things not been great between the two of you right now. \n\nSo this year he tried a humorous card for a change. And while that didn't work for you, your reaction of going upstairs and crying sounds way over the top and points to things been far from perfect in your relationship", "He sounds depressed. Make his ass go to therapy. He can't sleep all day, do no chores, and just half-ass everything in life.\nI'm sure losing a parent is super hard (I have both of mine still, dread the day they pass). With that said, everybody loses their parents eventually, and people can't just quit life because of it. Been 3 years, time for him to get his shit in order.\n\nAlso no more kids for now, atleast until he is back on track.", "NTA but I feel for husband.  He probably just ran out of ideas.  I have done some very romantic things for my wife. (Eg.  Bowl with 100 love notes etc) but eventually you just run out of ideas.", "NTA\n\nHe was being thoughtless. He knows the gift isn't important and in any case the gift was from your little boy and him and mainly for the benefit of your little boy to be able to give you something, but what he says in a card is important to you. What concerns me he put \"Love your husband\" no sentiment not even his own name. That is just cold.\n\nEither he is having issues of his own he won't talk to you about, Issues at work, Debt problems, alcohol or drugs dependency, or he is just not interested in you or the marriage anymore.\n\nWhatever it is you both need to talk, maybe even couples therapy.", "I had a large bday last month.

It isn\u2019t fair to weigh others down with your problems. Have you communicated to him what this is doing to you instead of locking yourself away in a room? Sometimes men are very reluctant to admit they have a mental health problem. You might even have to be firm with him that his behavior is not acceptable and give an ultimatum.
