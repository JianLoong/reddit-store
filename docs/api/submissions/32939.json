My husband and I are not into giving eachother gifts, mostly because we hate to shop so it's never been a big deal to not get anything on special occasions like birthdays etc. \n\nMy husband and his family however are hugely into card giving, they take the time to pick the right one for the receiver. They also write thoughtful and lovely messages, honestly it's so great! \n\nMy husband gave me a gift today from him and the kids - I knew it would be something simple but I was really looking forward to the card from my husband because they are always so sweet. However what I got was nothing like this. My card read as follows:\n\n   The front of the card reads \"Ever get a card. . with fifty bucks inside? Well, get ready...\"\n\n   Inside it reads \" cause here they are\" and there are literally 50 bucks (the animal). \n\nI grinned but I was surprised that it wasn't his usual thoughtful card. This is something that he would pick for a buddy.  \n\nNow this is where my heart sank. He wrote \"Love your husband\" that's it. Reddit I have seen this man write paragraphs on cards where he writes meaningful things not just random every day things like \"best wishes\" or \"have a great one\" \n\nIn the gift bag was a box of chocolates and under that thrown in there was $70 bucks. \n\nI smiled gave my little guy a chocolate and went up to our room to cry. He came in after and said \"I knew you would be up here all depressed\" I lied and said \"No\" and he left. Later when I was ready to talk I said \"honey, I'm just upset because usually your cards are thoughtful and you write something nice but this time you didn't\" his response was \"so?!?\" \n\nHe later blamed me for not giving him any gift ideas, to which I responded \"I don't give a shit about gifts and you know that, this is about the card\" \n\nSo....I ordered them pizza for dinner and left to go and have dinner with my mama instead.

Going by your comments, he really does sound like he has pretty severe depression.\n\nThat thought in mind, it really puts the words he said to you, when he came to see you, in a new light.\n\nHe knew the card was bad. He knew you would likely hate it. He knew he should write something heartfelt on it.\n\nBut he couldn't, not with his level of mental energy. Considering he got that defensive over it, it must be sore spot for him.\n\nIt sounds lien you are going through a really rough patch now. I hope he gets help for his condition, and he can become more like the man you fell so in love with.\n\nBest of luck.", "NTA. \u201cI knew you\u2019d be depressed.\u201d WTH? if he knew you weren\u2019t going to like it, why did he do it? Why the sudden change from years past?", "NTA. Ok so he said he knew you would be upset, well why didn\u2019t he write something more meaningful then?! Sounds like he was trying to pick a fight.", "NTA. Notice how you shared your feelings and he blames you? Also notice the silent treatment. Big red flags here.", "INFO\n\nI'm a little confused because at the start of your post you said \"I don't care about presents **or cards**\" and then later you said you were really looking forward to the card from your husband because they are always so sweet. So apparently you do care about cards at least if they are from your husband. Have you made it clear to him (before this incident) that while you don't care about gifts, a thoughtful card is in fact important to you? It might seem obvious that \"he should just know that\" especially since his cards are usually more thoughtful, but since you said earlier you don't care about cards, I'm confused about whether he actually knew how important his usual cards are to you. Do you get him nice cards with a well-thought out message written inside for his birthday? \n\nIt's also confusing because you said he followed you upstairs and said he knew you'd be depressed which makes it seem like he at least suspected that you might not like the card. Honestly, I don't know how to judge this. The whole situation is confusing to me. It sounds like some kind of communication issue between the two of you.", "INFO\n\nIf I asked him how you treat him, what do you think he'd say?", "NTA. Seems clear to me he did this specifically to make you upset, or else he wouldn't tell you he knew in advance and give you a \"so??\" when you told him the problem. So the question is why is he hurting you on purpose? What's he trying to achieve? If you're giving him a pass because his dad died three years ago, sorry to say, but that sounds a bit naive. You can't keep explaining his actions with his dad's death - even if he's still grieving, hurting his spouse on purpose and/or removing all effort from your relationship isn't part of that process. And I say that as someone who was crushed when my dad died.", "YTA\n\nYou don't \"do\" the gifts and card giving thing because you don't like to go to any trouble for others, and you're having a fit because your husband didn't give you the sort of card you've come to expect from him. You're a self-centered A.", "So he's had an off year regards the thoughtful card, I think your reaction to this is way over the top. Although his message and his reaction to your reaction, could point to things not been great between the two of you right now. \n\nSo this year he tried a humorous card for a change. And while that didn't work for you, your reaction of going upstairs and crying sounds way over the top and points to things been far from perfect in your relationship", "He sounds depressed. Make his ass go to therapy. He can't sleep all day, do no chores, and just half-ass everything in life.\nI'm sure losing a parent is super hard (I have both of mine still, dread the day they pass). With that said, everybody loses their parents eventually, and people can't just quit life because of it. Been 3 years, time for him to get his shit in order.\n\nAlso no more kids for now, atleast until he is back on track.", "NTA but I feel for husband.  He probably just ran out of ideas.  I have done some very romantic things for my wife. (Eg.  Bowl with 100 love notes etc) but eventually you just run out of ideas.", "NTA\n\nHe was being thoughtless. He knows the gift isn't important and in any case the gift was from your little boy and him and mainly for the benefit of your little boy to be able to give you something, but what he says in a card is important to you. What concerns me he put \"Love your husband\" no sentiment not even his own name. That is just cold.\n\nEither he is having issues of his own he won't talk to you about, Issues at work, Debt problems, alcohol or drugs dependency, or he is just not interested in you or the marriage anymore.\n\nWhatever it is you both need to talk, maybe even couples therapy.", "I had a large bday last month. I got a nice card with lovely words and a packet of chocolate.   I eat chocolate about 3 times a year .  Except he'd picked an anniversary card by mistake, wrong glasses apparently,  and wrote birthday over the top.  He chose his fav restaurant to take me to because he had a craving.  \n\nToday on his bday he got a generic card,  at least it was a  birthday one ,  and is having  homemade spag bog with no garlic bread.", "NTA.

How nice for him - now, what exactly does he contribute? \n\nIf he's depressed he needs a therapist, and if he's not depressed he needs to man up and actually take on some responsibility for what is supposedly his family. \n\nI'm gonna guess that a lot of people on here will be assuming this behavior change is because he's having an affair. My guess is that it's depression, but either way he's pulling back from your relationship, and he needs to commit to working on himself, and prioritizing his family, for the good of everyone.\n\nIf he's not interested in doing any of that, well, then, he may be the love of your life, but you aren't his.

But some people have entitlement issues where they treat their partner like crap but still expect their partner to want to be romantic towards them anyway.\n\nHis opinion of you and the condition of your marriage matters a lot.
