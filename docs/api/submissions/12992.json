I can absolutely understand that your wife is depressed, but there\u2019s only so much leeway you can give in terms of responsibility.\n\nI don\u2019t blame you for snapping if you\u2019ve bottled it up for so long. We\u2019re all human.

If not make sure she does because this will only get worse otherwise.\n\nI have family/friends who have/had depression and professional help is the only thing that helps.", "NTA snapping after 6 months is not outrageous.

Well I'm pretty sure you don't want to clean her mess neither... \n\nI'm my last relationship, my ex expected me to be 100% dedicated, she was basically erasing my possibility of having a bad day, disagreeing with her or being remotely negative.\n\nI kept a lot inside, by fear of starting a fight by talking about how I was feeling. \n\nIt was very hurtful to be called unsupportive when I was putting aside my well being for her 90% of the time.

I have rebuilt my life and am in a good place.\n\nBUT - after dealing with all the hard, difficult, and just exhausting aftermath, I went into a depression.

I have actually started exercising again!", "It sounds like your wife might have ADHD in addition to depression. Might be worthwhile to look into", "NTA\n\nI'm currently also on sick leave for depression and can sympathise with your wife. However, although the illness can explain a lack of energy to tidy up or forgetting to take the rubbish out, it's not an excuse to never doing it. Her saying that you're `pushing her to do stuff she doesn't want to and that you don't understand her feelings` says more about her willingness to tidy up after herself and that she's then using the illness as an excuse instead of trying to make an effort.\n\nIt's usually encouraged to set small easy goals for yourself (every day) to feel accomplishment, and doing something as simple as taking the rubbish out one day up could easily be that.", "YTA for screaming at your wife. I understand that you are frustrated but screaming does not help the situation and just causes further breakdown of a relationship and communication. \n\nIf you're wife is on sick leave for depression and burnout, it must be pretty bad. I have bipolar disorder and was on a medical leave for 2 years due to a severe depressive and mixed episode. What is your wife doing to help herself? Is she working with a doctor on medications and a therapist for therapy? I struggled with keeping the house clean as well and felt like a burden on my husband which only fueled my suicidal thoughts. Luckily my husband was extremely supportive. I worked with a psychiatrist on medications and a psychologist for cognitive behavioural therapy. We set small, achievable goals but also practiced self compassion when I wasn't able to achieve those goals. I couldn't manage cleaning the whole house in 1 go. I had a to do list of small tasks. I would practice self care tasks like taking a shower and brushing my teeth, but would also pick up the laundry and put it in the basket (my husband would do the laundry). If I had the energy, I would also collect the dishes and put them in the kitchen. I took bigger tasks and broke them down into smaller tasks. To clean the bathroom, one day I would clean the sink, the next day I would clean the toilet, if I had the energy I would also sweep the floor, or I would do that the following day. \n\nYour wife is going through something very difficult. Screaming at her is not going to help her come out of her depression any faster and is only going to make her feel worse. I understand that you are dealing with your own stresses, but you need to find a healthier way to communicate. I suggest you both go to therapy. As a couple but also individually if you can afford it.", "Is she in therapy because its time for therapy. She does have to return to life eventually and it sounds like she is at a standstill. Yes no one wants to do those things and oh boy depression is no joke! Living life feeling no accomplishments ever like she is will not help!", "YTA for screaming. \n\nAlso 35 hours a week is less than a full work week. Lots of people go to school while working full time too.", "YTA, but just for screaming at her. It's hard to do basic things (even getting out of bed) when you're suffering from depression. It's also really hard to be there and care for a depressed person. Both of your feelings and sides are valid, and you have to try and manage it together, with communication (and professional help). Screaming and blowing up will not solve anything. I do hope you two can overcome this.", "Not an asrehole question but a relationship one.\n\nYou have been together since you were 18.\n\nIt's not working, I would jump.

She made him go to therapy which took another 8 month to get back to A functioning household. It took a toll on her mental state. SHE ALMOST NEEDED THERAPY! NTA your wife needs to understand there are 2 people working at this relationship.", "NTA. The whole world doesn't stop for one persons mental health. If I were in your shoes next free time I would start de-cluttering. Live more minimalistic, and cull everything you don't use.

It was hard to get up, take a shower, go to the store, EVERYTHING seems like a monumental task that you simply are incapable of completing.  Is she taking medication?  Because it sounds like she is having an MDD episode and MOST of the time, that will drastically improve with antidepressants.  Once the medicine has done the work of resetting the brain, some people (NOT ALL) can actually discontinue the medication.\n\nAt any rate, I know how hard it can be to be on the other side of the partnership as well, and watching your partner keep sinking is REALLY heartbreaking.  YOU may want to go see a therapist just to have someone to talk to and vent your frustrations with, as well as they may give you tools to be a PARTNER in your wife's HEALING.  I am certain she is not doing it on purpose, AND her not doing things already MAKES HER FEEL LIKE A COMPLETE FAILURE, so you feeling upset about it doesn't help.  If she doesn't manage to tidy up by the time you get home, maybe you could ask her to come help you in the kitchen while you prepare dinner, and then she can tidy up WITH you and you can have quality time WHILE you are both busy with domestic chores.  Be supportive and see if you can coax her gently to do a task here or there, even though she feels awful, actually getting UP and moving around can actually help her feel better. \n\nSee if you can get her to just sit outside for a few minutes everyday as well.   Sunlight, even if it's cloudy outside, can have a remarkable effect on people who suffer from depression.  Also, I know you are in an intense training period for your new career right now, but see if you can educate yourself with a book or even youtube videos on ways to help a family member suffering from MDD (Major Depressive Disorder).  \n\nHOWEVER, you ALSO need to care for yourself and your own mental and emotional health as well.  The thing right now is to BE GENTLE TO BOTH OF YOU and allow things to slide for a minute.  There IS AN END TO THIS ROCKY ROAD you are on, medication, therapy and sunshine can ALL contribute to healing.  \n\nNAH  Because you are BOTH doing the BEST YOU CAN RIGHT NOW and it is REALLY HARD right now, and that's okay.  Grace and patience are what is needed the most right now.

So 35h of school without counting on the extra work on weekend and every evening. \n\nIm not saying I'm super super busy. But yeah, shit is hard.", "Thank you for this heartwarming message. I'll definitely show it to wife.\nThanks a lot, it means a lot", "I had the same idea .", "She doesn't tidy the place. She cleans it. If there is cloth all around the place and dirty dishes,  then she won't have time to do it all", "NTA, should you have yelled? Of course not but you care and are frustrated. I think the big thing is to try to turn this into a more productive conversation, which I know after an extended period of time can be difficult.\n\nI have had similar issues with depression, and while I am not saying, this is necessarily the case I used to have a really hard time doing anything at certain points. I was fully capable of getting up and doing it. I knew it would make my life ultimately better And I knew that it wouldn\u2019t really take that much time but for some reason it was like I couldn\u2019t get up and just do it. Even something stupidly quick and easy like taking out the trash. It was incredibly difficult to explain to people so I would say I forgot things.\n\nFor me, the solution was creating a more structured day but again, I would assume that\u2019s very individual. I don\u2019t really know how you would go about bringing that up gently but I think asking if it\u2019s really forgetfulness or if she needs more help addressing that specific problem.", "Ah the way it was worded sounded that you finished and are now working 35hr a week. Both at the same time is a lot.", "Oh ofc that totally justifies yelling at someone so unwell they're on medical leave!", "Depression and Alzheimer's disease are not in the same ballpark. I deal with depression. I've had two grandparents die from late-stage Alzheimer's. Sometimes it slips my mind to pick up something because I'm to focused on what's going on in my head. My grandparents both couldn't speak in sentences toward the end, and the only thing Grandpa remembered was one of his brothers and the hymnals.", "I was just throwing it out there as a possibility so OP could consider everything. I wasn\u2019t diagnosing anyone.", "Considering she's in therapy, I think she's probably gotten a medical diagnosis.", "I don't think assumptions can be made about how hard someone works just based off their hours. I mean, the whole point of these 4-Day work studies was to find out if the same productivity levels or higher could be achieved compared to a 5-Day working week (they could). It's like comparing a sprinter to a longer distance runner; both work hard but at different intensities.", "People are often in therapy for depression and don\u2019t get diagnosed with ADHD until later. Anything is possible"]}
