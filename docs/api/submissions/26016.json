He's cute, nerdy, and lives pretty close to me! I asked him if he wanted to meet up which he agreed to so I brought him over to my house. We had a great time, honestly, and I thought to myself that I'd really be interested in getting to know the guy and spending more time with him. Important to note is that while we were having sexual relations that night, he asked if he could take pictures of my feet and private areas, which I consented to. He did not tell me what he had planned to use them for.\n\nWe talked a bit throughout the next week, and then he more or less ghosted me. I don't know why, though I don't really need to know why. Fast forward to last night. I checked his Twitter (X? Whatever it's called now) profile, and find that it's entirely filled with photos and videos of him having sex with other men. It hit me then that my photos are probably there, and sure enough they were.\n\nHe had posted pictures of my body, genitals, and feet, as well as a video that I was unaware of that depicted us having sex. To say that I was furious was an understatement! I immediately messaged him, told him that he posted pornographic content of me without my consent, and that he needed to take it down immediately.\n\nHis response? \"Okay, go ahead and block and delete\" followed by some laughing emojis. Fortunately for me, the content did get taken down. However, his complete lack of remorse at my rage, and his willingness to post MY body on social media, still has me irate.\n\nI made a police report with the sheriff's office, and they said that because my face was not in the content, the best they can do is to call him and speak with him. About what, I don't know, but it's a paper trail.\n\nI cannot be the only person that he has done this to. His social media is filled with other mens's genitals! And he shows no remorse for it. Unfortunately for him, he told me where he works. I want to call his manager, and inform them that their employee just had a police report made against him for posting nonconsentual nudity of others on his social media, and that if he told me where he works, then he's told other people that he's posted nudes of where he works. Plus, one of the videos on his page is him being \"visited at work\", and shows him clearly doing sexual acts.\n\nI am mortified and embarrassed, people. Never again will I EVER allow someone to take or receive nude photos/videos of me, but I want this fucker to learn a lesson. WIBTA if I called this guy's job and let them know EXACTLY what kind of person is working for them?\n\nEdit: If I were to contact his job, I would do so anonymously. I don't intend to reveal who I am when I do it. I don't know what the law says about revealing something about an employee that is, quite honestly, already information available to the public via social media, but I highly doubt that telling his boss that he posts nudes of others without consent and tells them where he works would be criminal in and of itself.

Regardless of whether or not I consented to the TAKING of the photos, he did something that I did not consent to which was to post them online for the public to see. I am not responsible for that, and to think otherwise is simply wrong.", "No you are responsible for your choice. Guess what, if you never let them take the pictures, there would be no pictures to post. You can keep ignoring that fact if you want but that is the truth of the matter.", "Here's what you don't seem to get: I understand that I shouldn't have let him take the photos, AND I am not responsible for him posting them online. The two things are not mutually exclusive. You're right that if I hadn't let him take the photos, then they wouldn't be online, but it was HIS choice to post them online, and I cannot and will not be responsible for his choice.", "You keep harping on about his choice and ignoring that if you hadn\u2019t made your choice first, he wouldn\u2019t have had the option to make his choice to post the pictures.", "Pretty sure that I owned up to that several times while speaking with you. Enjoy your victim blaming mentality. I can see that you're not open to reflecting on it."]}
