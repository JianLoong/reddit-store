The bigger risk with headlice in babies is that they tend to attack the eyelashes which results in inflammation (also risk of corneal damage from the baby's scratching. Honestly, scabies can also look a bit like a lice infestation early on and is (unfortunately) common amongst people living on the street and in low-barrier shelters.\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22360386/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22360386/)\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/lice/head/epi.html#:\\~:text=Head%20lice%20are%20not%20known,occur%20with%20any%20lice%20infestation](https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/lice/head/epi.html#:~:text=Head%20lice%20are%20not%20known,occur%20with%20any%20lice%20infestation).", "Just in case anyone replies to you to say that it's only the saliva - that's not the case. Depending on the size of the lice you can actually feel them moving around and they can make you itch.", "Yes, she visited you a few times, and weeks passed, and the lice that got on your head laid eggs and 1-2 weeks later the eggs hatched and the processed continued. \n\nIt doesn't happen in FIVE days.", "Head lice is different from body/clothing lice. \n\nWe don't yet know if OP has it too, because she assumes it's from the brother in law and she is therefore \"safe.\"  But she's not.  Because it can't have come from the brother in law. Her kids had it already.", "Itching can occur faster than that if the person has live lice and feels them moving around. Unfortunately I know from experience when I was younger... \n\nThe brother was homeless so it's easily possible that he had an extreme infestation. I'd encourage OP to get checked out, obviously, but I don't find this hard to believe.", "Yup, you don\u2019t get itchy after only a few days, the kids might have had it for a while & no one realized.  It\u2019s actually easy to miss the signs, I did, you get complacent & life is insane then before you know it , lice party.\u2639\ufe0f", "It happens immediately! Didn't passed more than a week!", "? I didn't say they were the same? Head lice nits can still end up on clothing etc depending on the scenario. That's why you have to clean all your bedding and clothing in order to be sure that you're rid of them. \n\nIt's still possible that it came from the brother. Like I said, if he had a severe infestation they can move pretty fast. OP should get checked out, obviously, but acting as though it's impossible isn't right either.", "Dude, quit being the unreliable lice police. It doesn't take weeks.", "That's when you get it secondhand from school, or from shared hats or something. People living in close quarters pass the whole infestation very readily.", "They\u2019ve previously been exposed due to child bringing it home from school: not a stretch to start itching as soon as they get their stupid fuckin faces on you. In fact it\u2019s pretty common"]}
