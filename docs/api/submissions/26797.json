There was plenty of time.", "Yeah her husband would make kid number 5, since he bahaves like a child, hence the 5 children (4 + husband)", "The two times I got lice as a kid I felt them within two days. I could feel them crawling around on my head and it made it tickle and kind of itch.", "Yeah, I think people are incredibly misinformed about how to treat lice. \n\nThey aren't like bedbugs. Lice need a host to feed off of and a warm place to stay, so they aren't going to live very long without that. \n\nThey're disgusting and tedious to get rid of, but that's about it. \n\nGod, just writing this comment is making me head itch.", "Knowledge is power.", "My family used vinager to remove the eggs, so I smelled like a salad every time I had live as a kid. They also used other things that should never go into anybody's head, especially a kid \ud83d\ude05", "So does conditioner... and it's a lot less gross\n\nOP you are NTA.", "Lice are totally common and safe for kids, very low/no risk situations. However, they do break the skin and cause itching. Anything that breaks the skin should be avoided as much as possible with a newborn. Not only do they have almost no immune system, but risks of bacterial infection are much much higher. Newborns pre-inoculation have very few natural defences to pathogens.", "Wow, that's crazy. I don't remember the specifics of the conversation I had with my teacher (literally 25 years ago), but if I remember correctly she said it was bad if it got in your pubes. Weird.", "There is no safe lice treatment for babies under 2 months old. While the lice on their own may be safe, the treatment that everyone and everything else in the home needed is not safe for a newborn.", "She said he had to clean the furniture. It isn\u2019t fear mongering to avoid infestations that involve breaking the skin away from a newborn with no immune system.", "*We do not have endemic typhus in the US.*\n\nYou do not know whether OP is in the US. She could be posting from anywhere in the world.\n\nI wouldn't mind a dollar / pound / euro for every Redditor who has assumed I am in the US and has responded with a US-based suggestion totally inappropriate for my country.", "Bacterial conjunctivitis secondary to head lice is actually pretty common (at least in the EU). MRSA is at an elevated risk for newborns even without an infestation that causes severe itching. If you think a course of antibiotics for a newborn is easy, you\u2019ve def never dealt with it. Babies that young can\u2019t take antibiotics orally and need to receive them through an IV (usually at a hospital). MRSA also can\u2019t typically be treated with wide spectrum antibiotics so there is some trial and error. It\u2019s even been shown to slow growth when given very early on.", "Do we know OP is in the US?", "Epidemic not endemic and it just means \"typhus from lice\" - rare but does exist in the US.", "I'm sorry \ud83d\ude2d Tbh thinking about it makes me itchy too, lol.", "Exactly. Anybody who looks at updated current recommendations will see that. \n\nMost places don't even recommend or require that kids be kept out of school for lice- and a lot of school districts no longer inform parents if there is an exposure at school. That is how differently lice is seen by experts now. I am not saying I fully agree with that- when my kids had lice I posted it on the school Facebook page so their classmates parents would know to check their kids heads. It's nothing to be ashamed of- after I posted that a LOT of people found lice on their kids! It was a silent outbreak. We had no idea.\n\nMy head is itching.", "Lol the kerosene treatment?", "Maternal antibodies circulate in the blood of newborns for several months after birth. Antibodies are also transmitted through breast milk. We recommend newborn vaccinations around the time that they are no longer protected by the mother\u2019s immune system.", "There are several treatments that do not involve using the medicated shampoo, I always found the special lice comb and nit-picking worked the best, and I didn't need the shampoo very often. The mayonnaise under a plastic bag didn't work very well though. Haha, never doing that again. Also, you can always shave the hair off.", "Combing out the lice is safe. I wouldn't wish it on anyone, but it's a totally reasonable treatment. I got rid of lice on my kids that way. Took a week,  but most of it was gone within 24 hours.", "Avoiding infestations of lice isn't the part that is the fear mongering. \n\nExaggerating risks of lice is.", "It's standard to clean furniture and wash everything when there's head lice. I've done it too many times with my kids. Avoiding infestations is good! One hundred percent agree with that. The fear-mongering part is the exaggeration of the risk.", "Depending on where you live, you could end up very rich.", "How often does a case of head lice lead to MRSA in a healthy infant who is not in the nicu? Not very often is my guess, but I'm open to seeing the research.\n\nEdit: Or even a case study. I'd read that.", "Endemic means commonly found/occurring and is perfectly fine to use in their context.", "Schools don't even require parents to disclose exposure? Yeesh. I could understand for middle school aged and older, but kids in primary school are pretty gross as it is and don't have the same understanding of hygiene. We shared hats, sweatshirts, helmets, and brushes all the time in primary school. \n\nThe only time I've had lice was as an adult, on a business trip overseas. Honestly wasn't terrible. The hotel had a giant steam shower so I spent hours in there combing and had housekeeping change my sheets daily. Not terrible but not an experience I ever wish to repeat.", "Yeah no one is going to take advice from the guy who thinks it's perfectly safe for newborns to get lice of any kind. Stop being a weirdo.", "That is one of the myths. It turns out you do not have to go crazy cleaning out every nook and washing sheets daily. (Save that for bedbugs- that's what I would be worried about getting!) With lice just treat the head. Keep going as new nits will hatch. They can't live anywhere without a host- so don't worry. If a lice is on your bed or somewhere and it reattaches then you will comb it out the next day. As long as you keep treating the scalp until the infestation is gone and then keep checking/treating extra for new nits you will get rid of the infestation.", "I think it has to do with a few things- preventing shame and stigma, plus if they aren't making kids stay home then they think why should they do the work of keeping track of who has lice and sending out notes.and dealing with dramatic parents calling. \n\nI do think they should share the info, typically, in elementary school. A friend had randomly said to a bunch of us \"hey I am like a lice removal expert now after I hired this person to help me when my kids had lice. so if your kids ever get it then call me. I will tell you the very specific comb to buy - the ones at the drugstore don't work, and I will teach you how to use it\". so she helped me and then I helped neighbors during our school outbreak. We can't help each other if nobody will talk about it! We need to know when there is an outbreak!", "> I think it has to do with a few things- preventing shame and stigma, plus if they aren't making kids stay home then they think why should they do the work of keeping track of who has lice and sending out notes.and dealing with dramatic parents calling.\n\nThey don't need to identify which child has lice, but a heads up that lice is going around at school would help me to catch it before it spreads to everyone else in the house."]}
