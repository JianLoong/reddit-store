I've been diagnosed with HG and I've been hospitalized once already. We don't live close to either of our families (we live abroad and both families live in different countries, so there are three countries at play here). \n\nA couple of weeks ago, my MIL called to check in on me and said that if I felt up to the travel, she'd be delighted to host me at their home until I felt better. No strings attached. They have a large estate and a private chef who had already agreed to work with whatever my doctors suggested or I craved. I could rest as much as I wanted and would hardly need to lift a finger. It was her hope that I would consider it and come for a visit that would let me rest. \n\nMy own mother also offered to let me come visit her for as long as I need to. (Sidenote: my husand and I have a very nice place and it's safe and comfortable but my husband also travels a LOT for work so staying elsewhere would be really nice while he's traveling.) My parents also have a large and nice estate but it's closer to a tourist type location. While I could spend my morning in the gardens at my in-laws, I'd be quite a bit warmer and feeling \"on display\" by my family if I were to stay with them. I just know that they'd be wanting to go out all the time and I'd be expected to go with them. I can barely turn my head or sip water without getting sick on my worst days, though. \n\nIn the end, I chose to go to my MIL's home and it has so far been so restorative. Very calm and easy and quiet. MIL checks in on me and I feel so cared for here that it's been very relaxing. I'm very grateful for the opportunity. Baby and I are doing so much better since we got here. My mother and sisters, though, are angry and saying that I spit in their faces by declining their offer to host me in my home country. They say that a pregnant woman should always choose her family to cling to during pregnancy because only they know how it's like \"for the women in our family\" and can offer specialized advice and care. \n\nAITA for prefering the peace and quiet of my in-law's more rural estate?", "created_utc": 1697763976, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17byx8i/aita_for_accepting_my_mils_offer_during_my_first/", "score": 201, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What you needed was to relax, stay calm, and not be expected to do a ton of family stuff when you can barely keep food down. You did what was best for you and the tiny human you are growing, and I get that your family feels slighted, but it wasn't about them, it's about what you and baby needed. Perhaps you can visit them sometime during your pregnancy if you feel more up to it or have them visit. But you know them, and if it'll stress you out more, best to ere on the side of caution.", "NTA.  \n\nYou have to do what makes YOU feel right.\n\nI had terrible pregnancies where I threw up all the time and honestly just whatever situation you feel best in is the one to be in.", "NTA\n\nYour family is jealous you didn't pick them. There's really nothing wrong with being jealous that your own child didn't \"pick mom to make her feel better\", where they turn into ah's is accusing you of \"spitting in their face\" and attempting to make you feel bad for your decisions. \n\nTell your family that if they can't accept your choice and drop it, then they won't be speaking to you until their attitude changes.", "Nta you picked the best option for you, it also sounds like your family puts their needs above yours. MILs offer was the best option. \n\nI would use this situation to realize how they will be when the baby is here. They will expect to be the priority over MIL", "NTA, if they knew what was it for women in your family during pregnancy they wouldn't be cussing you and putting extra stress on you.", "I survived (barely the last one) two HG pregnancies. I lost teeth the last one from vomiting so much. I had a 24/7 IV line and a continuous zofran pump. It was HELL! You do what ever you need to do to survive and don\u2019t feel guilty about it for one minute. No one unless they have been there can understand. Definitely NTA!", "NTA. Your priority is keeping you and your baby safe and healthy. You are doing what you felt is best. They should be supportive either way.", "NTA\n\nYour in-laws are family too.", "NTA;  If your MIL is offering you comfort in your pregnancy, sounds like a great thing.\n\nThis is the family you married into... it is not always a problem.  Your family can pound sand especially if you feel comfort and safety for you and your baby.", "NTA.  You are choosing your family.  Your MIL is your family too.", "NTA! Pregnancy is a marathon, not a sprint. Your MIL (probably with advice from your husband) was able to offer you a restorative setting for this first trimester. There will be more time for you to stay with your immediate family later in the pregnancy when you\u2019re up to it \u2014 especially when it comes to showers/celebrations and seeing friends in your home country.\n\nYou can\u2019t do that then if you don\u2019t take care you and your growing baby now.", "Finally, a thread in which the MIL is a rockstar.", "NTA just by you families reaction you made the right choice.", "NTA. \n\nYou did what was best for you and your growing family.

So refreshing to see a kind MIL! This is amazing! My friends nearing the end of her pregnancy and has suffered from HG the entire time. She isn\u2019t able to not work.. if she had an opportunity like you had I would 1000000% encourage her to take it! HG is horrendous", "NTA!!! With my first it was EXACTLY the same way. All I could some days was attempt to nibble on a pedialyte popsicle and hope I might get something in my body that day. The last thing I needed was anyone guilting me for taking care of me and my LO. Your in-laws is EXACTLY where you need to be right now. Being loved but from a distance certain days is exactly what you need. Don\u2019t let them guilt you. Your mother should be thankful that someone loves her baby so much that they want to take care of her.", "NTA. No one gets to dictate to you about what is best for you. You needed the calm,  quiet time your in-laws could offer you. Take care and I wish you and your baby good health!", "NTA. Exactly what a woman with HG needs in her hour of need, the stress of worrying about other women\u2019s needs and wants. The women in your family need to take several seats. Your pregnancy is not about them. Time to stop engaging with them if they can\u2019t behave rationally. Additionally, you did choose your family. MIL is also your family and unlike your mother and sisters she is giving you exactly the kind of care you require.", "NTA I wonder what specialized advice and care they think they can offer. But you wanted to relax and recover and not stress for your own health and your child's health. You did the smart thing, and you know that because it's working.", "NTA. \n\nI had HG with both pregnancies and it is literal hell. I spent the majority of both pregnancies in the hospital. Trying to do anything except sleep was pure torture. \n\nBeing around anyone who doesn\u2019t understand how bad HG is requires energy that you don\u2019t have. When you are that sick you do whatever you need to feel better or even to just get through it.\n\nI preferred being in the hospital to being at home with my family because I didn\u2019t feel like I was dying in the hospital. My mother had HG and knew exactly how I was feeling and did everything she could for me \u2014 and I still preferred the hospital. I wanted to be somewhere I could find ANY relief from how badly I felt. \n\nIf that\u2019s what you need and if that is not with your family, then it doesn\u2019t matter where else you go as long as it helps you feel better and doesn\u2019t make you feel worse.", "NTA. You did what was best for you and the baby. And it sounds like your MIL is MIL of the year. There's so many horror stories here about MILs regarding pregnancy but is sounds like you were blessed with a loving and caring one who put you and your needs and baby's needs first. If your family cannot see that, then that's their problem.  \n\nDo not ever feel bad about this. You chose what was best for you and baby. And THAT is the most important detail. \n\nCongratulations, OP, and I wish you and baby and your loved ones a happy and healthy future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I can understand why your side of the extended family wasn\u2019t thrilled, but that doesn\u2019t give them the right to attack you for making the right choice for you and your child. If they keep attacking you or guilting you, let them know that their current behavior is going to be the reason they get zero contact with you or your child for the foreseeable future. They are testing a boundary: can they manipulate you into doing what they demand or not and how much do they have to throw at you before you relent. Do NOT give them the chance. They either knock off the guilt trip and aggressive behavior or they never meet your child.", "In your place, I'd put off visiting your mother and sisters for a while.

You need some extra TLC. \n\nMaybe later in your pregnancy when your symptoms aren\u2019t so severe you can visit them for a bit so it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re favoring one over the other (you aren\u2019t, but they seem to feel that way).
