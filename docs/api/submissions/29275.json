I'm trying to be vague in case my family runs across this. I'm in my first trimester and it's very early on. I'm so sick all the time. I've been diagnosed with HG and I've been hospitalized once already. We don't live close to either of our families (we live abroad and both families live in different countries, so there are three countries at play here).\n\nA couple of weeks ago, my MIL called to check in on me and said that if I felt up to the travel, she'd be delighted to host me at their home until I felt better. No strings attached. They have a large estate and a private chef who had already agreed to work with whatever my doctors suggested or I craved. I could rest as much as I wanted and would hardly need to lift a finger. It was her hope that I would consider it and come for a visit that would let me rest.\n\nMy own mother also offered to let me come visit her for as long as I need to. (Sidenote: my husand and I have a very nice place and it's safe and comfortable but my husband also travels a LOT for work so staying elsewhere would be really nice while he's traveling.) My parents also have a large and nice estate but it's closer to a tourist type location. While I could spend my morning in the gardens at my in-laws, I'd be quite a bit warmer and feeling \"on display\" by my family if I were to stay with them. I just know that they'd be wanting to go out all the time and I'd be expected to go with them. I can barely turn my head or sip water without getting sick on my worst days, though.\n\nIn the end, I chose to go to my MIL's home and it has so far been so restorative. Very calm and easy and quiet. MIL checks in on me and I feel so cared for here that it's been very relaxing. I'm very grateful for the opportunity. Baby and I are doing so much better since we got here. My mother and sisters, though, are angry and saying that I spit in their faces by declining their offer to host me in my home country. They say that a pregnant woman should always choose her family to cling to during pregnancy because only they know how it's like \"for the women in our family\" and can offer specialized advice and care.\n\nAITA for prefering the peace and quiet of my in-law's more rural estate?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who chimed in and messaged me with more personal advice. I took the advice of some here and spoke to my mother and sisters today. All is well. The really rude \"spit in our faces\" comment was made by my much younger sister who apparently had been planning a very nice low-key getogether for us and our other sisters. She was especially disappointed in hearing that I wouldn't be going home to see them at this time. My mother and other sisters did confirm that they'd planned to have dinners and small parties and breakfasts and all sorts of gatherings to celebrate the pregnancy and baby and they understand that I'm in no condition for it. My MIL has graciously suggested that I invite them all here when I'm feeling up to it and we can have gatherings here at whatever level I feel up to. For now, I'm doing so much better on a new medication. Some of you were totally on the nose when mentioning those nutritious soups. Thank heavens for soup weather! I've been sipping on some of the best stuff I've ever had for the last two days and feeling stronger and more like a human for it. Thank you again for all of the advice and suggestions on finding comfort. You're all a very lovely community and have set my mind at ease.

Insist to the IL's that you have no preference on what their decision will be, and you are not asking for anything that would make them uncomfortable, as that would make you uncomfortable and totally counter to their intended offer and graciousness. Their comfort in providing you this great comfort in your life is all that matters and again greatly appreciated, and you want nothing to do with anything that would make them regret having you there.\n\nYou seem to have done as well as I did in marriage in not only finding a great mate; but also by getting wonderful ILs. My inlaws are the most welcoming people I could ever ask for. They are always gracious hosts that are peaceful and loving while making no demands on me. I always try to return the pleasure by not being demanding and offering help they may need if I see a possible need, that they often turn down as unnecessary.\n\nWhile my wife did not fare as well as me as my mom is also a demanding person who's only thoughts are what she wants, and the world should just give it to her when she wants it as many times as she wants it.\n\nThere is no need to get involved in an argument with your family but to just tell your mom that this place is such a sanctuary for you that tourist town can't give you. And you just know your sisters are too demanding and would make your visit all about themselves, and you not only would get no peace, but you also would have extra demands made on you, which you don't need if you want any calm in your life. \n\nThis might just get your mom on your side a bit and she can place the blame on your siblings.
