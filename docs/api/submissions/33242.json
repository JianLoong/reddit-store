You asked about allergies. I can completely understand those who requested food that would accommodate their allergies. And it is very gracious of you to follow through with that.\n\nI personally draw the line with food accommodations that are PREFERENCES. You are preparing a whole damn Christmas dinner. Those that do not have an allergy and simply a preference should be grateful for that. Shame on them for the backlash. For them to complain is just in poor taste. If they don't like it, they don't need to come. Period.", "NTA \n\nMake a really big (vegan, no salt added) salad with cheese, and dressing on the side. Don't include any carbs (like crutons) or any added salt in the salad. Provide a couple of dressings that accommodate the low sodium, low carb, vegan requirements (when in doubt balsamic vingar and olive oil can be provided for people to mix in their preferred ratio). And then tell the people who put up a stink that there will be sufficient salad for their meal, and they are welcome to bring additional safe foods to supplement it.\n\nThen, you are \"accommodating\" their needs which meets the host \"requirement.\" You shouldn't feel obligated to go all out on a multicourse meal with dietary restrictions you're unfamiliar with. And you aren't required to take individual orders. You aren't running a restaurant. \n\nFWIW, I'd assume that the people who offered to bring their own food have actual medical needs and the others likely have preferences. They may be hoping that you'll put in the work to make a special, holiday meal so that they don't have to, but the reality is that large group holiday meals usually end up being kinda boring for people who have dietary restrictions. That's just the way it is.", "NTA but the folks who sent nasty messages need to be uninvited right now. Their audacious behavior needs to be eliminated from the event. They do not belong there.", "NTA some of these requests e.g low carb, high protein are not allergies but lifestyle choices. Frankly it\u2019s quite obnoxious and entitled to respond with preferences rather than allergies. I feel Todd should respond to the people being nasty that their responses are uncalled for and not inline with the spirit of the season and because they have insulted you their attendance is no longer required. \n\nIf this is going to cause blowback for him at work you can just have the AH\u2019s bring their own stuff but the sheer gall. Please sit them at the kiddy table.", "NTA. Technically, the host is supposed to accommodate their guests and make them comfortable, but within reason. A lot of these sound like preferences, not allergies. Accommodating someone\u2019s peanut allergy because they\u2019d otherwise go into anaphylactic shock is one thing. Making 12 dishes to accommodate conflicting preferences is another. \n\nI have food allergies and, though I appreciate it when hosts actively accommodate, I recognize it can be a lot and never show up empty handed. It\u2019s only polite to come with something in hand. A potluck approach sounds like a great idea and those who aren\u2019t willing to contribute anything more than complaints don\u2019t seem like the type of guest you\u2019d want to have.", "NTA\n\nYou said they were welcome to bring their own food. \n\nBut next time, don't send out an email question about their needs  -- that sets up an expectation. Instead, plan some diverse dishes and send out an email of the menu, noting guests are free to bring dishes if desired to accommodate dietary needs.\n\nedit: Do this with the original invitation so they can easily turn down the whole invitation if it doesn't work for them.", "NTA - LMAO your list just made me laugh. Understandable if they had allergies or even religious reasons and even vegetarian but high protein low sodium etc is just obnoxious. Honestly get rid of the guests who are acting up. \n\nLOL wtf is low potassium low histamine in food?", "Low carb: they can eat the meat and skip the potatoes, sorted\nGluten free: eat the meat and veg, skip the bread\nLow potassium?! What even is that? Skip the traditional Christmas banana and eat the turkey\n\nPeople these days are mad..\n\nNta", "NTA. Are all these people actually allergic to these things? Sometimes I feel when you ask people this they think it\u2019s ok to tell you about their preferences, it\u2019s a bit rude when you\u2019re hosting a large amount of people basically if it\u2019s not going to kill them why should you need to cater to it, for 1 day they can deviate from their preferred diet or not come, I would no way do this Christmas is stressful enough with a large amount of people even when everyone is eating the same thing.

I would advise in the future, telling the guests what you are going to cook, and if it doesnt fit their dietary needs to please bring in a dish they can eat, or that you'll order their food of choice once they get there. Never give them a choice. It's your house, and you're the host. You call the shots.", "NTA. You're being more thoughtful than a lot of hosts! As someone with life-threatening food allergies, I appreciate your concern on allergic people's behalf. And I know it's also thoughtful for you to offer vegan/veg options. \n\nBut all the rest? That's on the eater. When I've been on restrictive diets, the onus has been on ME to make sure I eat within whatever those guidelines are. Plus: it's ONE MEAL. Either navigate the menu as best you can, or enjoy the water and company. Goodness. \n\nYour encouragement to bring a \"safe\" dish or meal  is also a reasonable suggestion. \n\nThe good news is, vegetarians and non-dairy can handle what vegans eat. And there's probably overlap in the other categories too. \n\nMy one suggestion is, that if you host again, you specify \"illness-inducing or life-threatening allergies,\" and frame it for your and the guests' awareness vs an ability to accommodate everything.", "NTA,\nYou asked for allergies. Tbh, I think you and Todd should have ignored all their BS and just made what you wanted with vegan options. People are wild.", "NTA. There is a difference between needs and wants. You needn't provide for wants. But if someone has a nut allergy, you could kill him if you made anything with nuts. You specifically asked for allergies, not preferences. People can have their preferences in private, but there is no need to impose them on your host. Especially not when you are allowed to bring a dish of your own. Not all hosts will allow that.", "Allergies, vegan and veg - yes, would be good to cover. \n\nAnything else: BYODF (bring your own damn food)\n\nNTA.

Prawns have been off the menu at the big Christmas dinner for years with no complaints. I have a medical condition managed in part by diet. I have never asked for accommodation, just pick from what is offered that suits. The complainers are the AH not you.", "Those preferences are absolute rediculous. I bet 10$ the actual allergy folks had no issues bringing thier own dishes to enjoy but the stupid \"preferences\"  people are the ones being so difficult and self absorbed. Lol. \n\nCook what you can and tell them to eat or don't. \ud83e\udd37 Expecting you act like their own personal chef is super entitled.", "NTA -- it's reasonable to be asked to accommodate allergies and intolerances but not other dietary preferences for a single meal. \n\nWith so many people coming, supplying a detailed menu of what you're doing and asking each person to bring a dish is very reasonable.\n\nBut think about this in future, because if you are vegan for example then being invited to dinner and not having food provided you can eat does kind of suck.", "NTA between me and my son we have to have but free, dairy free, carb free (IBS) so we eat different but I don\u2019t expect others to cater send out the menu and if they don\u2019t like it dis-invite them and they can cook their own!!", "NTA\n\nHigh protein? Low carb? \n\nReally lol\n\nA lot of the others can be rolled in, pescatarian can eat vegan, gluten free/dairy free/fodmap can be catered with the same dishes pretty easily too. \n\nI've never heard of low histamine, potassium or alkaline being a dietary request.", "As someone with food allergies, I think this is a great way to handle this. \n\nWhen I\u2019m hosting, I like to say my menu beforehand for this reason. \n\nI do suggest always making one side or salad vegan and gluten free. It\u2019s easy and cheap to do and it can accommodate a lot of people\u2019s crossover diets\n\nThen at least someone has something to eat, and they can bring their main dish too. \n\nGrilled or oven roasted veggies with some olive oil is one of my go-tos. If you do it on skewers, it makes it easy to grab. Or make a salad with dressing on the side and no cheese or croutons (lettuce, cut up peppers, broccoli, veggies, etc.)", "NTA.  Time to uninvite some.", "NTA\n\nCook a Turkey, unseasoned, stuffing separate. Steam all the vegetables - provide gravy (meat juices and cornflour). Prepare a vegan dish that can also be used as a side (cauliflower and spinach made with vegan cheese?).\n\nRoasted vegetables in a pan - use olive oil and no seasoning. Potatoes, carrots, parsnips.\n\nSeasonings can be added at the table - salt, pepper, Seasoning-All, celery salt, chilli flakes, smoked paprika, garlic salt (you could roast some garlic in olive oil). I also have plenty of jellies - Rowan, cranberry, tayberry, quince, gooseberry, blackcurrant, sloe - all homemade, just fruit and sugar with quince for pectin.\n\nSorry, but I have had to cater for Coeliacs, nut allergy, lactose intolerant, vegetarian, tomato allergy, low salt and potassium, at Christmas before so I have got used to catering for mixed diets. Luckily there were no diabetics or vegans so my cauliflower cheese worked with normal cheddar. By steaming the vegetables, having boiled and roasted (in olive oil) potatoes, gf and normal yorkshires and having two ovens plus a halogen oven and an air fryer I coped. Luckily the nut allergy didn\u2019t eat gravy, and the meat juice and cornflour gravy could be split into some with Bovril added so the low salt and potassium still had some he could use (Bovril is high salt).\n\nFor pudding I had a frozen cream roulade, with mince pies, ice creams, sorbets and fresh fruit. No  Christmas pudding because I couldn\u2019t be arsed to do custard.\n\nBuffet tea was help yourself to cold Turkey, a variety of cheeses, a pate and cooked ham with a green salad, celery and carrot sticks, assorted pickles, mayonnaise and salad dressings. Bread rolls and gluten-free bread also available with two separate butters (one unopened next to the gf bread). I did provide fresh tomato\u2019s for those who could eat them. Oh, and there was homemade gooseberry chutney and quince jelly (membrillo).\n\nPotatoes - boiled in salted water - low salt can have roasted.", "NTA; we have vegan and kosher folks in my family, and that is hard enough. So we do potluck; not everything can be eaten by everyone, but that way we make sure everyone can have a plate.", "NTA\n\nI think it\u2019s very poor taste for a guest to *insist* that you accommodate their dietary preferences. You asked, which was polite and appropriate, and your communication of your inability to accommodate despite your earnest effort and desire was also gracious. The couple of colleagues who snapped back are completely out of line, and I wouldn\u2019t ever invite those two over again.", "NTA.\n\nAllergic, Doctors order and  vegans are what we accommodates, all the other ones are just  fads.  So the pescatarian can eat vegan food .  \n\nWe used to make Vegan Zucchini Lasagna Roll Ups for the people  who cant have meat and   that is gluten free too.  You could make this, do 2 pans , one salted and one not salted.\n\nAnd lasagna roll ups for the  rest and the dairy free can eat vegan if they want. \n\nReason,  my friends have real allergy to meat, fish, dairy, grain allergy  ( rare as heck)   poultry and beans.   The person who cant eat beans can eat  meat thanks God. \n\nI'm used to finding something every one can eat.   Pinto bean fudge was a hit last time, well the bean allergic got whisky.", "NTA\n\nI have food restrictions myself (sugar) and I would NEVER expect a host to be forced to accommodate.  I don't even expect that at my own mothers for holidays.  \n\nI know relatively what the menu will be and then I bring something to add on for me and something for everyone.", "NTA. People have gone wild with their dietary preferences and expecting everyone to accommodate them. You sent out the menu, which was super helpful. Maybe if someone said something like, \u201cHey can you leave this ingredient out of this dish so I can eat it?\u201d But Mr. \u201cLow Carb\u201d needs to chill out.", "Nta as long as you're planning vegan options, don't make things non vegan where possible ie roast potatoes in oil, not animal fat . Have a detailed menu available. Serve it up buffet style with all items labelled with ingredients. Ensure you have individual tongs/spoons so there isn't cross contamination. Use minimal salt and include it on labels.\n\nI think if you make something like a roast with all the sides, you'd be able to have food for everyone and make more portions than you would usually. \n\nAlong with fancy desserts, have cut fruit, etc, available, again buffet style.\n\nThen everyone is responsible for what they put on their plates.", "There's a balance usually. \"Can we please have some vegetarian options?\" Sure. \n\n\"Everything has to be vegetarian!\" Don't even come to my house...\n\nThere isn't balance when you're having panic attacks...\n\nThere are minimal issues since we started, \"These are all dishes with all ingredients, please bring something else if it's not to your liking\" is emailed with the invite. Not sure if that's an option here/at this stage.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nTheoretically it could be managed by having different subsets -- foods A, B, C are vegan, B D E are low carb, A E F are low sodium, etc -- but that's headache inducing with a lot of restrictions, plus if something gets mislabeled that could be a problem.", "I'm not going to say you're an AH, but inviting a vegan and then refusing to make vegan food definitely sends a message.\n\nI'm vegetarian. One year my dad invited me for Christmas and didn't think to get a vegetarian main. That hurt. My family has been the hard to accommodate one. My doctor told me to avoid aspartame. My kids' allergies have, at various times, included: sweet potatoes, mangoes, tomatoes, dairy, egg, tree nuts, soy and oily fish. I know how hard it is to cater for this, I lived it every blooming day. When someone made the effort for us, it was appreciated.\n\nI don't think this problem was insoluble. You could have eliminated diets that could be solved by making choices on the day (low carb, high protein, etc). Then got in touch with the ones that are genuinely difficult or obvious quackery (low potassium and FODMAP, alkaline and low histamine, for me) and said you didn't feel able to tackle those, and were very sorry but could they bring a dish. The people doing things like FODMAP would understand that it's a huge endeavour and appreciate you being honest about your capabilities rather than attempting it and poisoning them, the alkaline people weren't going to be happy no matter what you do. That leaves the vegan/pescatarian/dairy free, which can all be rolled into one vegan dish (something with beans in it, vegans need protein just like you do). You could make or buy that one. The only remaining category is the gluten free, I'd probably call them up and check whether they would be ok with what you are serving anyway, because they probably would, but to go above and beyond, make one more dish. \n\nYou've done the whole thing with a maximum of two extra dishes. I don't think many people expect to get away with catering for a crowd and not offering a vegan dish, in any case. Ask everybody to bring a dessert.\n\nYou're not the AH for getting overwhelmed, or for deciding you've bitten off more than you can chew and aren't up to hosting. But providing something people can eat is kind of the bare minimum, at a meal.\n\nOne final thing: it's kind of Reddit lore that anyone with a dietary restriction should be ecstatic about bringing their own food. I've done a fair amount of that, when my kids' allergies were hard to cater for. But where I'm from (the UK) it's also seen as quite rude to turn up with a tupperware. It kind of makes the statement you don't think they are adequate hosts. I once properly offended someone with my bag of hummus, pitta and cucumber.

It sounds like to address all of them, you would need to cook at least 4 meals worth of food, with most of it still being unacceptable to more than 1 or 2 people! Sending out your menu beforehand was a good move. \n\nIt also sounds like some guests wanted their own preferences catered to, rather than eating food that does meet their requirements but goes further? For example, most recipes that are gluten and dairy free are often fairly easy to tweak into being vegan as well. If they are dairy/gluten free and vegan, then it should fit the pescatarian and usually the low sodium eaters. If the pescatarian is asking for an alternative protein dish, then they should bring their own. \n\nNot sure you can reconcile the high-protein and low carb people, but those are usually very much *preferences* rather than medical or ethical issues. (I know they can be, but it's unusual) In the case of preferences, they can eat more turkey for protein or skip the potatoes to lower the carb count. Or they can have a free cheat meal. \n\nA traditional Christmas meal looks like it (at a very quick look) contains many things that are fine on a FODMAP diet, especially if you offer dairy free options or alternatives, like having regular mashed potatoes and clearly marked dairy free mashed potatoes. That's just with a quick look, though. \n\nSome of those are medically relevant but more difficult. The low potassium is harder, because I wouldn't know what is safe or not.  I thought histamine was what your body produces in response to allergens, so again I would need more research before I could safely prepare food. \n\nGood job for cutting through all that in a still respectful way.
