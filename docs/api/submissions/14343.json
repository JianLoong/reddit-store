I\u2019m visiting her for Easter with my parents, and I was excited to see her.\n\nI love my sister, but she makes me do things for her and isn\u2019t ever grateful. It\u2019s things like getting her a glass of water and getting her laptop charger from upstairs. Sometimes making her food or cocktails and bringing them to where she sits. Sometimes I feel like a butler. She is completely mentally and physically able, mind you. I don\u2019t really have a problem with it usually because I think it\u2019s just the way she likes to receive love (she hates physical affection). But this service is unreciprocated, and when she asks me to do these things she never says please or thank you unless I prompt her to do so. It\u2019s been like this for about four years, which is when we grew close. She\u2019s my mother\u2019s favourite, yet even Mum has laughed and commented on how my sister demands things from me, telling me I can say no.\n\nThis Easter, I came to visit her and her new puppy (Patch) for my mid-semester university break. Puppies obviously need lots of attention, and she will be a good dog mum\u2014she is very responsible. But over this trip she has pushed the responsibility onto me. My butler duties continue on vacation and expand to dog-sitting.\n\n I\u2019ve fed Patch, filled his water, taken him out to the bathroom more than anybody so far and was the only one stopping him from eating things he shouldn\u2019t. If I called her attention to him eating something bad, she would say \u2018go stop him!\u2019 When he woke up from a nap she would say \u2018take him out for a wee.\u2019 She leaves him with me and expects me to look after him without even asking sometimes.\n\nMy sister and I got in the car to go grocery shopping today. She was getting ready to drive and said \u2018I forgot my phone, can you go get it?\u2019 I sighed but I was smiling and clearly just playing when I told her I didn\u2019t want to. She said \u2018go get it.\u2019 I told her I can\u2019t cave to her my whole life, but I was still being playful about it. She was very serious when she said \u2018We aren\u2019t going anywhere until you get it.\u2019 I am sick of her ordering me around like her chore machine. So I told her I\u2019d get her phone, but she could go by herself. She agreed to this, but was shocked when I gave her the phone and went back inside. My parents are mad at me too now.\n\nAITA for refusing to go with her to the grocery store? Maybe I\u2019m TA because I should have just done it and not jokingly complained.\n\nTLDR; my older sister treats me like a butler and takes advantage of my love so I refused to go to the grocery store with her\n\nEdit: sorry for my title typo I can\u2019t edit it\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I should mention it\u2019s not me who created this problem, but my mum and dad. She has zero respect for Dad and he acts like her slave in a similar way, getting whatever she wants whenever she asked for it her entire life. But he will never change, though I\u2019ve told him he should. My mum never stood up for him either or told her to stop. \n\nI\u2019ve actually stood up for myself several times but my mum gets mad at me for it. Even though she told me I can say no. I\u2019ve told my sister \u201cNo, I\u2019m not your slave, do it yourself\u201d and the family is torn in two until mum tells me to apologise. I used to fight my sister and mum against this until I submitted like my dad four years ago to make life easier.\n\nUpdate: She is palming Patch off to me and my parents. They\u2019ve booked him in for shots and I have to take him because nobody else can. He could die if he doesn\u2019t get them so I have no choice. It isn\u2019t right for an innocent dog to suffer for her choices", "created_utc": 1681011837, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12g7t1r/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_out_with_my_sister/", "score": 117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What happened today in the car is utterly ridiculous and shows she has 0 respect for you. She is rude and entitled", "NTA. Practice saying No. As many times as you need to, get to to where you can look her in the eyes and just say No. You don't need to argue or explain.

NTA", "NTA First you said it\u2019s very obvious she\u2019s the favorite child. So naturally parents will take her side. Secondly, your sister sounds like your parents never told her no. Or even taught her. Thirdly, even if she was bothered by you not coming to grocery trip it should not result in you ruining an entire Easter. Lasty, your parents literally said you have free will and can say no, you said no and no means no. If your parents and and sister say you ruined an entire holiday because you said no and stood firm on that no. Then their entitled, and I\u2019m sorry you had to put up with that.

This dynamic will take a toll on you and your parents if you don't start setting boundaries now.  Unfortunately your parents have enabled her demanding behavior for far too long already.  I know from experience that you'll never be able to force them to set boundaries, but that doesn't mean you can't do it for yourself.  \n\nSit her down and tell her that while you love her, she is not entitled to treat you like her slave or demand your service.  Say that you're saying something now because you would hate for your relationship to deteriorate beyond repair, which is what will happen if she can't be bothered to treat you with respect.  Tell her that if she can do that for the rest of your trip, you'll come see her the next time you're invited (or you'd be happy for her to come visit you).  If she can't, then the next time she wants to get together, you decline.  The time after that, you get her buy-in that she'll treat you not as an inferior but as an equal.  If she doesn't do that, you leave.  Following through is important, and if you do it consistently, she'll see that you're not going to let her walk all over you like she does your parents.  \n\nTBH, she sounds like an overgrown toddler.  My nephew struggles with please/thank you and having whining fits, so when he's demanding, I \"don't hear him\" until he says please.  Probably also works on adults.", "Stop going to visit. Always be busy at school or have an exam or similar and do your own thing. When you do go back, make lots of plans with others so you are out a lot.

It\u2019s great you went to therapy and have started standing up for yourself. When you change expected behaviours people who don\u2019t respect you will try to push you back into the behaviour that suits them. The \u2018we are not going anywhere until you get my phone\u2019 is an example of this. I would say talk to her if you haven\u2019t that this is how you feel and not the sister relationship you want, keep refusing to do anything she can do herself and start to restrict visits if she won\u2019t respect you. Same with your mom, if she says you can say no, tell your mom no when she asks you to apologise. If they don\u2019t get it it might have to be limited contact relationship to protect yourself sadly. Good luck", "Sorry but you created this monster by bowing to her every want. You're mum even told you you didn't have to do everything for her yet you still would allow her to push you over. This is why most people have bullies for so long, they don't stand up for themselves. \n\nNta but who can you blame other than your self?", "YTA for enabling her behavior.

My advice, for what it\u2019s worth: you have two options to help her (& your parents) notice this behavior of hers. \n\n1) ACTIVE: stop doing things for her. Just say no and leave it at that. No is a complete sentence and you don\u2019t have to justify it. If she does like she did today, agree to go get it, then walk so die and sit at the table.

I can't believe what I just read... super fucked up that your mom encourages this dynamic, and that your dad just goes along with it...", "I'm sorry your sister has treated you that way. I have three sisters and I get that when we are teenagers, we sometimes don't exactly treat our siblings with care and love at all times.\n\nBut she is way beyond that age, and is still acting in a really manipulative and unkind way. You don't deserve that.", "I hate to break it to you but you didn't \"get close\". She just switched to a different punishment/reward system for manipulating you.", "She might want to spend time with you because you are her Butler. Also, a free Butler.", "Man, if I made her pay fees four years ago I\u2019d be rich!", "Thank you. I do think she\u2019s a good person and I love her, she just doesn\u2019t have that empathy, for whatever reason. I don\u2019t want to cut her out like people are saying I should, but my contact with her will be a little bit lower simply because she moved away", "I think so. People love to give her stuff and do stuff for her! She\u2019s very skinny like a barbie, good with makeup and hair. Boys chase after her like a dog with a ball, so when she asks for favours they fall at her feet", "Thank you for being considerate. I saw a psychiatrist from age 16-19 and she put me on medication and helped me come to terms with it all. It also eliminated my fear that I would end up like her. I spent age 12-15 hopping between psychologists and they didn\u2019t help as much\u2026what kind of therapy do you do?", "Dude be a bit more gentle. If you read all my comments you\u2019ll know I\u2019m not a doormat, I\u2019ve stood up for myself several times only for the family to split in two. I know she\u2019s taking advantage of me but it\u2019s difficult to break free of conditioning lasting from when I was a toddler, plus physical and emotional abuse. I\u2019ve gone to therapy and I\u2019m medicated. I am outspoken and stand up for myself in every other relationship except with my family because it got me hit by my mother until I was 16 and decided to cave to commands so I wouldn\u2019t be hit anymore. Since then our relationships drastically improved from what they once were. I could only afford to move out part time, so I\u2019m currently away from home half of the month with my partner. We are saving to move out permanently", "Thanks so much for your kind words, I appreciate your empathy. I\u2019ve tried to stand up for myself to no avail, so hopefully she will learn the lesson elsewhere in life if I cannot show her", "That seems to be the response to everything with people these days. Just cut them out. I am not for that unless everything has been done possible to try and fix the problem, and they are still toxic. No one seems to want to put in the work to make things better.  I think if you sit down with her and have a heart to heart, things will change. If they don't, you just need to really stand up for yourself and say no. Over time of you not doing as she asks, she will stop asking.", "Ahh that makes sense then. Ugh. Please continue to stand up for yourself and don\u2019t get anything for her from here on out", "She won't look like a Barbie forever and guys won't put up with her ridiculousness forever.", "Overtime sounds like the best option for me. She\u2019s not really a person for heart to hearts, she\u2019s very closed off. I will definitely work on standing up for myself though, it seems to be a skill I\u2019ve lost when it comes to my family", "I\u2019ll do my best. Thanks for your support!", "Yes, I suppose when looks fall away there won\u2019t be the same appeal. I hope she eventually learns how to love better and finds someone. I\u2019m lucky enough to have a partner who loves me for me, so I don\u2019t have to worry!", "You know your family better than anyone, so do what's best for you and what you think will help. Take back your power, though. You can do it. It's just going to take time. Like you said in your post, enforce the manners with please and thank you. There is nothing wrong with doing things for people every now and then as long as they are being polite about it. You got this! I wish you the best of luck. Have yourself a great night!", "\u2764\ufe0f", "Thank you again! Happy Easter!", "Tell the mistress to ask her mother. Mummy won't be caving in so quickly", "NTA but stop enabling her. Yes, even with her dog she is manipulative. It's her dog so either she or your parents can take the puppy to the vet. It will cause arguments and tension but you have to stop enabling her. Her puppy is her responsibility. Stop serving her as well. She can make her own snacks and get her own drinks.", "NTA but stick to your guns, don't take patch, he isn't your responsibility, they can work it out without you and go low or no contact with family for a bit.", "NTA. And I wouldn't bother going to stay with her again, either.", "NTA and I want to add that from now on you should remember context. It isn't you causing problems by saying no, it is her causing problems with unreasonable demands.\nIt doesn't sound like she is a responsible person, she just makes people around her accept responsibility in her place.", "NTA - Go no contact.", "You should have gone inside, called your sister and left a message that you weren't going....", "YTA but everyone else in your family sure are.  Tell your sister you are not her slave or butler and you are done doing things for her and if she doesn't like it to bad.\n\nAlso, tell your parents you are sick of their favoritism for your sister and you are done with being a servant to a self-centered spoiled brat.", "Of course you're NTA but the problem isn't with your sister,  it's with yourself.  Until you can learn to tell her no, you can't complain that she sees you as a servant.  We teach people how to treat us by what we allow.  Ignore your parents and let mom get mad. You're 20 years old.", "I did this 10 minutes ago and it worked! Dog peed on the carpet and mum told me to clean it. I simply didn\u2019t do it and changed the topic. Sister got up and complained I hadn\u2019t done it, but did it. Unfortunately I have no say in the dog as my parents are going to bring it home, then leave it at home and go away again. So I\u2019ll be the only one there able to look after him. They booked the shots in and said I have to \u2018parent\u2019 him while they are away, and I asked if I was going to be paid for that and they changed topics", "Lol maybe I\u2019ll give that a go", "That\u2019s true, she would not cave lol. I think that\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t ask her. Mum is the only person my sister *sometimes* respects", "I have started strong! Tonight she asked me to clean the dogs wee and I didn\u2019t do it. She asked me to get up and close a door and I didn\u2019t do it. She\u2019s not happy but I\u2019m not a slave this evening!", "I feel bad for poor Patch but I\u2019m not going to take responsibility for him. He\u2019ll be living with my parents but unfortunately I still live with them part-time. I\u2019m saving up for a place of my own though! Tonight I\u2019ve stuck to my guns, I\u2019ll try to keep it up", "I told my partner never to let me come visit her again. I doubt I\u2019ll need to be convinced after this though\u2026almost got into a screaming match tonight over a board game", "I think I\u2019ve been raised to think she\u2019s responsible because she likes to work multiple jobs and worked from 14, went to uni straight away and got a good job right after. My mum always praised her for being responsible and on top of her life, but maybe she\u2019s actually not and I\u2019m just now discovering it\u2026this weekend and your comment are blowing my perception of her out of the water", "I\u2019ve told her several times over the years that I\u2019m not her slave and she gets so bitter, gets mum on her side and tears the family in two. I\u2019ve told my parents I\u2019m sick of their favoritism many times since I was 7 and they refute it angrily which also tears the family apart", "If you read my post you\u2019ll see it\u2019s my parents that taught her this behaviour, not me. My sister older than me, she is 22 years old and should have sorted out this behaviour herself, it\u2019s not my job to teach her how to behave, man. I\u2019ve told her repeatedly over the last few years and she just drags it out and makes my life hell. I can\u2019t ignore my mother because I live with her part time until I finish saving for my own place. I was physically and emotionally abused by the two of them for a long time and when I stand up for myself the shitty treatment gets worse and worse", "The problem is you think by smiling and joking while saying no you can get her to accept your no while also not getting upset. But what you're actually doing is saying \"haha, I'm saying no as a joke, aren't I funny, I obviously don't really mean it\" You're also waiting for a moment of conflict to say no as well. \n\nYou need to sit down with your sister, not in the moment she's making a demand on you, and tell her it's spoiling the time you have together, it makes you feel [insert here] and that you won't be doing it any more. And then you have to stick to that. When she asks you say \"remember what we discussed?\" and then \"no\".", "I completely understand this but do you think your sister is worrying about upsetting you? Do you think your parents are worried about upsetting you? \n\nI completely understand wanting to avoid unnecessary conflict but this is clearly having an impact on you so it\u2019s not unnecessary. It\u2019s not your fault if people are angry because you\u2019re standing up for yourself it\u2019s theirs.", "I'm a recovered people pleaser myself. I know it's hard, but I think you should work on being comfortable with other people being uncomfortable. Let them be upset. In fact, turn around and be pissed at your parents for raising your sister to be such an entitled and demanding brat. Be pissed that they have conditioned you to feel like you can never say no or put yourself first. The first time you say no will feel really hard, but after that it becomes the easiest word to say. No is a very powerful word. It's a complete sentence. It becomes very freeing to simply just say no and walk away. You're not responsible for anybody's feelings but your own, and you deserve to feel valued and respected. I was in a similar situation with my own sister a few months ago. She's used to her wants being prioritized over my needs, but due to a health condition, I was forced to finally put my foot down and enforce strict boundaries with her and my parents. For years, I wanted nothing more than a good relationship with her. I finally had to go no contact with her, and at first it was really hard. Now, I just feel a little sad to realize she's a terrible person and how much more peaceful my life is without her. My mom even went as far as to apologize to me for all the things she allowed my sister to put me through. You're allowed to do what's best for you, regardless of how it may impact others. Life's too short to settle for anything less than what you deserve.", "Best of luck to you", "It's a pity she doesn't ask her cos mum might be the only one who could get her to stop. You need to stop it though seriously cos if it doesn't, one day you will be babysitting, feeding, doing nappies and feeds, etc, for a baby that's not yours. Or looking after hubby, etc. Can you ask her to do stuff for you like I'll get your charger if you make me a sandwich, for example. If she says no, just turn around and say \"well there you go.\"", "Yeah I think you\u2019re right that I need to be more assertive. Ten minutes ago the dog peed on the carpet and I just refused to clean it when asked. Worked like a charm, though she\u2019s pissed off still! I didn\u2019t have to do it at least", "You make a good point, they certainly aren\u2019t worried about me. I\u2019ll take this on, thank you for your help", "That\u2019s a good trick, to ask her to do something for me. She\u2019d definitely say no but it would be good lol. I made a start tonight and refused to do two things for her already simply by not doing it and saying nothing about it", "See! It works. \n\nIt's really tempting to try and soften our message when having a difficult conversation. But if your message is \"this is a joke, ha ha\" or \"it's really not a big deal\" how are they supposed to know you're serious and that it is a big deal?", "Your sister and your mum sound like a very toxic people. I hope you can out of there soon and have the chance of some therapy to sort out of what you went through. I'm sure you are a great person and your sister doesn't deserve you. There are people out there you will love unconditionally, I hope you find plenty of them.", "Good work. She obviously needs to learn how to be a big girl and do her own thing. I would continue ignoring her when she asks you to do something. You could also be overly enthusiastic when she does it herself like clap really loud and say, \"good girl. Well done. Good job,\" like she's a toddler.  You are doing good already. Good luck sweet", "So true. I\u2019m very guilty for softening my speech, but no longer!", "Thank you so much for your kind words. I\u2019ve seen psychologists and psychiatrists (also medicated) but it\u2019s hard to heal when I\u2019m still in that environment. When I move out full-time I might try therapy again", "Ouch, but this rings true... my sister is similar to OPs. She was a real bully to me when we were kids. We managed to get a little closer when we were older, but she loves bossing me around.  Once I stepped out of line and stopped trying to placate her, she turned nasty. Now we're not close again.", "Thank you so much! I\u2019ll keep it up <3", "A good person has empathy, she in your own words does not.", "We all do it - especially in situations where we've been programmed to accept bad behaviour as normal. It's a hard thing to learn, but I've realised over the years if you can stay calm in a discussion and not let the emotions take over the brain (very, very hard, particularly with family) then it's amazing what you can say and it not have the entire scorched earth, go nuclear effect you were expecting! I'm much better at it at work than I am with my family - that's more of a work in progress!!", "What if she\u2019s like, autistic though? She\u2019s not diagnosed but with this lack of empathy and hate for physical touch what if she is? Would I be TA?", "It\u2019s good to know I\u2019m not alone on the journey. Thanks so much for your help", "No. She doesn't have the right to treat you like a servant regardless of whether or not she's autistic.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"telling me I can say no.\" .. THIS is it. Start to say NO. \n\nStop comoing home for the holidays. YOur family are abusive AHs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"He could die if he doesn\u2019t get them so I have no choice. It isn\u2019t right for an innocent dog to suffer for her choices\" .. you are willing to let her manipulate you.", "Both of you will have a very hard time in life if you don't change your attitude...\n\nFor you... I recommend finding courses to help saying NO.\n\nNTA... This is a first good step. From now on say NO to *everything*!", "NTA. You need to stand up for yourself more, say no   ignore her the next time she asks, I know it's easier said than done but you need to set some boundaries one way or another.", "Info : why have you been ok with to for so long ? Wtf, if my brother asked me to go get a glass of water he would've been ignored. You've let this go for 20 years ????", "NTA\n\nOP you need to throw the mother of all tantrums. I've never told someone that, but for your situation, it's perfect. You're the younger child. You're the one who's \"supposed to be taken care of by everyone else\". Use that position. Be a brat to your sister. Order her and your mom around. It'll at least show them a glimpse of what you experience. And don't raise a single finger for her dog. If not you, your parents will suck it ip and take care of him. That's on them.", "NTA - I would have given the phone to the puppy !\n\nIts time for you to find other people to spend time with. if your father can't find his back bone, you must find yours.  NO is a great word - let your mother and sister have each other.  \n\nYour mother may neve wise up and when they need somebody in their old age, your sister ins't the person who will help them", "I'd have gone one better. I'd have gone back in, collected my belongings and left telling her I was her sister not her servant/butler or dogs body. OP's parents are just as bad by not setting boundaries themselves.", "I just want to say, you shouldn't feel obligated to love your sister just because she is your sister. She has spent your whole life abusing you. Not loving her would not make you a bad person in any way. Same with your parents. If you love them, fine, but don't feel like you have to convince yourself that you do, or that you're obligated to act like you do. The best thing to do with toxic people is to not have them in your life, blood relation or not.", "Go to the vet, ask about training resources. The puppy is a helpless baby who will look to you to be her leader. With training, she will have a better life. As a bonus, it will irk the family that she listens to you best. \n\nI agree with others here that you should have an honest discussion with your sister. Does she actually listen to you? If she is the type to listen only to refute your statements and \"win\" the discussion, then write out what you want her to know, and give it to her just before she leaves. That forces her to sit with the information for a bit. It's possible that this could get past her initial defensiveness to an actual realization that you need her to be more kind and balanced. If nothing changes, then it wasn't the relationship you thought it was.\n\nIt sounds like she has made some effort to have a relationship with you. You need to let her know what you need going forward to continue and improve the relationship so that it works for both of you.", "Keep up those boundaries!", "Obviously you haven't meant it since you still do it.  Let her divide the family, when you don't do it for her she'll eventually have to do it for herself.  Better yet, let your mother start doing it and see how sick she gets of it and starts making her do it herself.  \n\nGrow up and put your foot down.", "I don't mean to sound mean, but you aren't close at all. You gave in, started following her demands and she got effectively a slave. If she cared for you or was close to you she would not treat you like this. She's using 'love' as a tool to get you to do anything she wants and you're falling for it.\n\nShe still hates you, she treats you like you treat someone you hate. She's emotionally abusive and well, showing traits of serious psychological problems.\n\nDO not give in, do not take the dog anywhere for shots. She booked some times to get shots that she can't do deliberately, it's more manipulation. She can rebook them any time she can take them, you know this deep down, it's another attempt to force you into the roll she wants.\n\nYou need to move out of your parents and cut contact. Hell it even seems like your parents realise your sister is more abusive than they were and think she's in the wrong. \n\nYour relationship being a one sided business transaction has NOTHING to do with her being a businesswoman, at all. \n\nI would immediately stop doing anything for your sister, go no contact when you get home and consider moving on from your parents depending on the current relationship. If they still hit you or are abusive, and you may need to speak to a third party and explain how they treat you and ask because you seem a little too inside the situation to understand what is right or wrong, to know if that relationship is relatively okay or not.", "Because you consider the relationship you have now sister like ? You're just a doormat here", ">  If you read all my comments you\u2019ll know I\u2019m not a doormat, I\u2019ve stood up for myself several times only for the family to split in two.\n\nI'm sorry that you see it as that, but you got out of the car, got her phone then didn't go. YOu still got her phone, she wanted you to get the phone. You didn't stand up to her, you gave in again. You're talking about giving in to take the dog to the vets. The dog is in zero danger, you're being manipulated and you're talking about givin in again.\n\nYou need to go no contact with your sister, you parents went to visit, that's fine, let them. You say you stood up to her last year and told her you wouldn't be her slave, then you visited and started doing things for her again. \n\nIf she or your parents you know you will give in again eventually after every time you stand up for yourself, then you're not really standing up for yourself. Stopping doing it permanently and not giving in again is standing up for yourself.", "Frankly, she just sounds very spoiled. And as long as everyone's jumping when she tells them to, she has no reason to stop."]}
