I\u2019m visiting her for Easter with my parents, and I was excited to see her.\n\nI love my sister, but she makes me do things for her and isn\u2019t ever grateful. It\u2019s things like getting her a glass of water and getting her laptop charger from upstairs. Sometimes making her food or cocktails and bringing them to where she sits. Sometimes I feel like a butler. She is completely mentally and physically able, mind you. I don\u2019t really have a problem with it usually because I think it\u2019s just the way she likes to receive love (she hates physical affection). But this service is unreciprocated, and when she asks me to do these things she never says please or thank you unless I prompt her to do so. It\u2019s been like this for about four years, which is when we grew close. She\u2019s my mother\u2019s favourite, yet even Mum has laughed and commented on how my sister demands things from me, telling me I can say no.\n\nThis Easter, I came to visit her and her new puppy (Patch) for my mid-semester university break. Puppies obviously need lots of attention, and she will be a good dog mum\u2014she is very responsible. But over this trip she has pushed the responsibility onto me. My butler duties continue on vacation and expand to dog-sitting.\n\n I\u2019ve fed Patch, filled his water, taken him out to the bathroom more than anybody so far and was the only one stopping him from eating things he shouldn\u2019t. If I called her attention to him eating something bad, she would say \u2018go stop him!\u2019 When he woke up from a nap she would say \u2018take him out for a wee.\u2019 She leaves him with me and expects me to look after him without even asking sometimes.\n\nMy sister and I got in the car to go grocery shopping today. She was getting ready to drive and said \u2018I forgot my phone, can you go get it?\u2019 I sighed but I was smiling and clearly just playing when I told her I didn\u2019t want to. She said \u2018go get it.\u2019 I told her I can\u2019t cave to her my whole life, but I was still being playful about it. She was very serious when she said \u2018We aren\u2019t going anywhere until you get it.\u2019 I am sick of her ordering me around like her chore machine. So I told her I\u2019d get her phone, but she could go by herself. She agreed to this, but was shocked when I gave her the phone and went back inside. My parents are mad at me too now.\n\nAITA for refusing to go with her to the grocery store? Maybe I\u2019m TA because I should have just done it and not jokingly complained.\n\nTLDR; my older sister treats me like a butler and takes advantage of my love so I refused to go to the grocery store with her\n\nEdit: sorry for my title typo I can\u2019t edit it\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I should mention it\u2019s not me who created this problem, but my mum and dad. She has zero respect for Dad and he acts like her slave in a similar way, getting whatever she wants whenever she asked for it her entire life. But he will never change, though I\u2019ve told him he should. My mum never stood up for him either or told her to stop. \n\nI\u2019ve actually stood up for myself several times but my mum gets mad at me for it. Even though she told me I can say no. I\u2019ve told my sister \u201cNo, I\u2019m not your slave, do it yourself\u201d and the family is torn in two until mum tells me to apologise. I used to fight my sister and mum against this until I submitted like my dad four years ago to make life easier.\n\nUpdate: She is palming Patch off to me and my parents. They\u2019ve booked him in for shots and I have to take him because nobody else can. He could die if he doesn\u2019t get them so I have no choice.

What happened today in the car is utterly ridiculous and shows she has 0 respect for you. She is rude and entitled", "NTA. Practice saying No. As many times as you need to, get to to where you can look her in the eyes and just say No. You don't need to argue or explain.

NTA", "NTA First you said it\u2019s very obvious she\u2019s the favorite child. So naturally parents will take her side. Secondly, your sister sounds like your parents never told her no. Or even taught her. Thirdly, even if she was bothered by you not coming to grocery trip it should not result in you ruining an entire Easter. Lasty, your parents literally said you have free will and can say no, you said no and no means no. If your parents and and sister say you ruined an entire holiday because you said no and stood firm on that no. Then their entitled, and I\u2019m sorry you had to put up with that.

This dynamic will take a toll on you and your parents if you don't start setting boundaries now.  Unfortunately your parents have enabled her demanding behavior for far too long already.  I know from experience that you'll never be able to force them to set boundaries, but that doesn't mean you can't do it for yourself.  \n\nSit her down and tell her that while you love her, she is not entitled to treat you like her slave or demand your service.  Say that you're saying something now because you would hate for your relationship to deteriorate beyond repair, which is what will happen if she can't be bothered to treat you with respect.  Tell her that if she can do that for the rest of your trip, you'll come see her the next time you're invited (or you'd be happy for her to come visit you).  If she can't, then the next time she wants to get together, you decline.  The time after that, you get her buy-in that she'll treat you not as an inferior but as an equal.  If she doesn't do that, you leave.  Following through is important, and if you do it consistently, she'll see that you're not going to let her walk all over you like she does your parents.  \n\nTBH, she sounds like an overgrown toddler.  My nephew struggles with please/thank you and having whining fits, so when he's demanding, I \"don't hear him\" until he says please.  Probably also works on adults.", "Stop going to visit. Always be busy at school or have an exam or similar and do your own thing. When you do go back, make lots of plans with others so you are out a lot.

It\u2019s great you went to therapy and have started standing up for yourself. When you change expected behaviours people who don\u2019t respect you will try to push you back into the behaviour that suits them. The \u2018we are not going anywhere until you get my phone\u2019 is an example of this. I would say talk to her if you haven\u2019t that this is how you feel and not the sister relationship you want, keep refusing to do anything she can do herself and start to restrict visits if she won\u2019t respect you. Same with your mom, if she says you can say no, tell your mom no when she asks you to apologise. If they don\u2019t get it it might have to be limited contact relationship to protect yourself sadly. Good luck", "Sorry but you created this monster by bowing to her every want. You're mum even told you you didn't have to do everything for her yet you still would allow her to push you over. This is why most people have bullies for so long, they don't stand up for themselves. \n\nNta but who can you blame other than your self?", "YTA for enabling her behavior.

My advice, for what it\u2019s worth: you have two options to help her (& your parents) notice this behavior of hers. \n\n1) ACTIVE: stop doing things for her. Just say no and leave it at that. No is a complete sentence and you don\u2019t have to justify it. If she does like she did today, agree to go get it, then walk so die and sit at the table.

I can't believe what I just read... super fucked up that your mom encourages this dynamic, and that your dad just goes along with it...", "I'm sorry your sister has treated you that way. I have three sisters and I get that when we are teenagers, we sometimes don't exactly treat our siblings with care and love at all times.\n\nBut she is way beyond that age, and is still acting in a really manipulative and unkind way. You don't deserve that.", "I hate to break it to you but you didn't \"get close\". She just switched to a different punishment/reward system for manipulating you.", "She might want to spend time with you because you are her Butler. Also, a free Butler.", "Man, if I made her pay fees four years ago I\u2019d be rich!", "Thank you. I do think she\u2019s a good person and I love her, she just doesn\u2019t have that empathy, for whatever reason. I don\u2019t want to cut her out like people are saying I should, but my contact with her will be a little bit lower simply because she moved away", "I think so. People love to give her stuff and do stuff for her! She\u2019s very skinny like a barbie, good with makeup and hair. Boys chase after her like a dog with a ball, so when she asks for favours they fall at her feet", "Thank you for being considerate. I saw a psychiatrist from age 16-19 and she put me on medication and helped me come to terms with it all. It also eliminated my fear that I would end up like her. I spent age 12-15 hopping between psychologists and they didn\u2019t help as much\u2026what kind of therapy do you do?", "Dude be a bit more gentle. If you read all my comments you\u2019ll know I\u2019m not a doormat, I\u2019ve stood up for myself several times only for the family to split in two. I know she\u2019s taking advantage of me but it\u2019s difficult to break free of conditioning lasting from when I was a toddler, plus physical and emotional abuse. I\u2019ve gone to therapy and I\u2019m medicated. I am outspoken and stand up for myself in every other relationship except with my family because it got me hit by my mother until I was 16 and decided to cave to commands so I wouldn\u2019t be hit anymore. Since then our relationships drastically improved from what they once were. I could only afford to move out part time, so I\u2019m currently away from home half of the month with my partner. We are saving to move out permanently", "Thanks so much for your kind words, I appreciate your empathy. I\u2019ve tried to stand up for myself to no avail, so hopefully she will learn the lesson elsewhere in life if I cannot show her", "That seems to be the response to everything with people these days. Just cut them out. I am not for that unless everything has been done possible to try and fix the problem, and they are still toxic. No one seems to want to put in the work to make things better.  I think if you sit down with her and have a heart to heart, things will change. If they don't, you just need to really stand up for yourself and say no. Over time of you not doing as she asks, she will stop asking.", "Ahh that makes sense then. Ugh. Please continue to stand up for yourself and don\u2019t get anything for her from here on out", "She won't look like a Barbie forever and guys won't put up with her ridiculousness forever.", "Overtime sounds like the best option for me. She\u2019s not really a person for heart to hearts, she\u2019s very closed off. I will definitely work on standing up for myself though, it seems to be a skill I\u2019ve lost when it comes to my family", "I\u2019ll do my best. Thanks for your support!", "Yes, I suppose when looks fall away there won\u2019t be the same appeal. I hope she eventually learns how to love better and finds someone. I\u2019m lucky enough to have a partner who loves me for me, so I don\u2019t have to worry!", "You know your family better than anyone, so do what's best for you and what you think will help. Take back your power, though. You can do it. It's just going to take time. Like you said in your post, enforce the manners with please and thank you. There is nothing wrong with doing things for people every now and then as long as they are being polite about it. You got this! I wish you the best of luck. Have yourself a great night!", "\u2764\ufe0f", "Thank you again! Happy Easter!"]}
