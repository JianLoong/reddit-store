We were in contact with our dad.\n\nBack when my parents were together, we lived on a ranch. I was and still am very close with my dad. When they were divorcing, the OG plan was for mom to keep my sister \u201cBelle\u201d while I had to stay with my dad, but it didn\u2019t work out because in a few years my dad went to prison for a few years.\n\nFast forward to a few years ago, I finished school and started searching for a job. Belle had no plans to study after high school.\n\nOur dad is in his late 50s, he has a lifelong injury that seriously affects his life to the point he can\u2019t work on the ranch without damaging himself any further anymore. He asked me and Belle to move in and help around. \n\nBelle obviously refused, saying that she\u2019d prefer her big city life, but I said yes. I have a vet tech degree, so it\u2019s not really a huge issue for me to work with livestock. Ranch life is pretty quiet and not that stressful. As a bonus, I started breeding herding dogs, which was my dream for a long time.\n\nFast forward to today, I\u2019m successfully running the ranch and the herding dog business. For those of y\u2019all who don\u2019t know, a good ABCS dog can easily be over $5k, and as I have good bloodlines and thoroughly tested parents, it provides an additional source of income. I managed to save up enough to afford dad\u2019s surgery that really improved his quality of life. \n\nBelle is living with our mom. She\u2019s NEET and she doesn\u2019t plan to do anything with her life. Mom doesn\u2019t want to cover her lavish lifestyle, and so she only pays for the essentials, which is a source for all the beef between her and Belle.\n\nRecently, Belle wanted to go on a vacation to Europe with her friends. Mom said that she won\u2019t pay for it, and so Belle asked me for money. Normally, I would easily help her as she\u2019s my sister and we\u2019re very close, but since I had to pay for dad\u2019s surgery, I had no spare money. \n\nThe thing is, I was planning to breed a bitch of mine with a very good stud. The whole thing costed me about $8k. I planned it long ago as said dog goes into heat only once a year, and the pups will be much more worthy.\n\nNaturally, when Belle found out, she was very pissed. She said that I\u2019m an AH for investing in stupid dogs and refusing to help her out. I told her she\u2019s an AH for not wanting to work and pay for her expenses herself.", "created_utc": 1701017199, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184euub/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_for_my_sisters_vacay/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
