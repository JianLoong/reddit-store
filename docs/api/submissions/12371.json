To clarify, he does not pee in the shower in lieu of the toilet, but if he's getting in the shower he will pee in the shower instead of using the toilet before getting into the shower. I know this is a pretty normal thing to do, but I HATE this. It's a huge pet peeve of mine when people pee anywhere that is not a toilet. I just find it really disgusting. \n\nIn addition to thinking this is really gross, I am the one who cleans the bathroom. I scrub the shower biweekly, clean the toilet and rest of the bathroom weekly, wipe the floors regularly, etc. Given that, and because I find it so disgusting to pee in the shower, I think it's fair to ask him to pee in the toilet before getting into the shower. How hard is that?\n\nHe will even go so far as to laugh and let me know that he's actively peeing in the shower while I'm in the bathroom brushing my teeth. He thinks it's hilarious and that I'm being ridiculous by being so bothered by this. Recently I told him he can start cleaning the shower himself if he's going to insist on peeing in there. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678897170, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11s16l6/aita_for_hating_when_my_husband_pees_in_the_shower/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

IMO, a good partner is willing to do small things to make their partner comfortable, even if the thing seems silly to them. The fact that he is rubbing it in your face when he knows it bothers you is just mean.", "NTA. I don't think you're an asshole for thinking it's disgusting. Technically I personally don't see anything wrong with it, but that doesn't mean you don't. Your husband should respect how you feel about it even if he disagrees with you. I find his behaviour in taunting you about it and making a point of telling you insensitive and uncaring. If he insists on ignoring how you feel about it, then he should clean the shower afterwards.", "NTA for what you feel or think about this. The point is: Your husband knows you hate that he does it, and he laughs and taunts you when he continues to do it rather than just not doing it.

Other than those two reasons, I see zero reasons that you know this, which means reality is not doing anything to you, but the idea of it is the problem.\n\nBesides the toilet/urinal being a purpose-built device, why do think there's an emotional difference to you?

You could always say nothing more and spray some bleach in the shower after you both are done showering for the day.", "NTA. This is gross. Bare minimum he needs to be the one scrubbing the shower.

At this point it's not about the shower, but it's about respect for each other in the marriage.  He may find you too controlling, and you may find him not validating/supportive. He may think you don't listen when he just wants to relax; you may think you do everything and can never relax.  \n\nIt's not about the peeing in the shower, it's about what you want to do with your future and how to find a way to validate each other again.", "ESH because he should clean the bathroom too but also pee is absolutely clean.

This is the kind of small, meaningless thing we adjust to live harmoniously with people.\n\nI especially wouldn't do it if they are the one cleaning the bathroom.
