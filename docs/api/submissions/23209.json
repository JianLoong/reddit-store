We got engaged in January and couldn't be more excited.\n\nIt's a very small wedding and we're only inviting close family and friends.\n\nThe problem is with my sister Lisa [F30]. Lisa has a 2 year old son with her husband. I don't have a super affectionate relationship with Lisa for multiple reasons that I can't fit into this post.\n\nWe sent out the wedding invites last month. Our wedding ceremony starts at 1:30pm and we asked our guests to please arrive at the venue by 1:00. The venue is in our hometown so is close by to the majority of the people in our guest list including Lisa.\n\nLisa told me that the time 'wouldn't work' because of her 2 year old's nap schedule. She said he takes a nap at 12 and that she's not forcing him to be awake so she can get him ready for the event or he will be a terror. I don't have kids but I thought this was a silly reason? I asked Lisa if she could find a babysitter and she said she can't because everyone she trusts will be at the wedding. I suggested that they at least attend the reception but she said she won't if she can't be at the wedding.\n\nShe told me she won't attend the wedding unless we change the time. I told her we can't do that. Lisa said she's not going then. I was quite hurt by this. I wasn't sure how to react in the moment so I just abruptly ended the conversation with an excuse.\n\nA few days later Lisa asked me if I thought about her suggestion. I reminded her there's no way we can change the time. She told me she hopes I'm happy that they aren't attending and said that everyone is going to ask why she's not there and it's all because I can't accomodate my nephew. I snapped at her and told her the world doesn't revolve around her and her son. She called me a bridezilla and has blocked me.\n\nMy mom is pestering me to make ammends with Lisa but I just don't think I'm in the wrong.", "created_utc": 1690403903, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ah2ap/aita_for_telling_my_sister_the_world_doesnt/", "score": 4929, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m assuming they wouldn\u2019t be at the wedding. \nHer asking to change the time is ridiculous.

Is there no one on her husband's side of the family (presumably not invited to the wedding) that can watch her son?\n\nI do have a suggestion that might help, if your sister were reasonable. When I got married, I had a 3 month old nephew, so I asked the venue if there is a quiet room that could be used as a nap room for babies. There is almost always some kind of space, like an office, or the bridal dressing room, that can be used for this, and is not a big deal for most venues to accommodate. \n\nThis would also solve the problem of finding a babysitter, because as your sister mentioned, all her trustworthy childcare options are already at the wedding. Anyone can step in and watch the baby nap while your sister enjoys herself.\n\nI also invited my SIL's parents for this purpose - they were able to watch the baby, and didn't feel like they were missing out on my wedding, since they weren't really expecting an invite anyway.

Your sister is deranged!", "\"I'm sorry I snapped at you. I was feeling frustrated because I felt like you weren't hearing me, but I should have taken a breath before I said anything. So, let me try again: I am unable to change the time of my ceremony. I'm sorry that it doesn't seem to work for you, but I want you to know that you are still invited to the wedding. If you are able to get a babysitter or if Nephew's nap schedule changes, I hope you are able to come to the ceremony and regardless of the ceremony, you are both still invited to the reception.\"\n\nNTA, but obviously snapping at someone is not ideal. In your shoes, I would apologize for that (even if you only do it to maintain the moral high ground since you know she's going to try to paint you in a bad light), but be politely firm that you are not changing the timing.\n\nIf she decides to double down on her AH-ish-ness by telling others about the dispute, you can easily say to anyone who asks, \"Yes, it is unfortunate that she feels attending the wedding would be too disruptive to Nephew's schedule.

I do hope she changes her mind and at least decides to come to the reception -- I think people would appreciate seeing both of them -- but again, that's up to her\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Both had a great day.", "NTA, as a parent, I would wake the child a little earlier that morning and offset the nap time by the same amount.   \nIt's not that difficult.   \nA small short-term adjustment in the kids schedule won't affect their day to day plans.", "NTA. It's a fucking nap time. You can't make him go to sleep earlier or have him take a nap *after* the wedding?", "NTA - That request is ridiculous. I have an (almost) 2 year old and would never dream of asking someone to change any planned event to accommodate my daughter, much less a wedding. I would just have my daughter nap in the stroller that day. As parents, flexibility is key.", "NTA for not changing the time, that's absolutely up to you but you can't get angry if someone chooses not to attend for a good reason.", "NTA- I hate disrupting my 1.5 year olds nap time and while that routine is very important for him, a lot of why I don't disrupt it is honestly for me, the time he sleeps is me time lol \n\nWhen I have an event or appointment scheduled I just alter his routine for a few days. I actually wake him up earlier so that he will be ready for his nap earlier or whatever, we make it work, we don't make others work around us.", "NTA.  Obviously your sister does think that the world revolves around her and now she is making it that it has to revolve around her child.\n\nTell your Mum that you cannot change all the arrangements just to suit one child and does she really have to disrupt all the others who will now have that time and date in their diaries and have made arrangements to be there.  Suggest she talks to your sister and explains that, but right now, you have offered suggestions and if she isn't prepared to sort her own life out to accommodate this one event then you are sorry that she will not be there!  Be kind but firm.  This is your day and do not let your sister take that away from you.\n\nTake some consolation that if your sister really is letting this child rule her life rather than getting it used to occasional changes to routine, then she is going to be in for hell as he grows up and is incapable of adjusting to change.\n\nHave your lovely, special day and enjoy it to the full.", "NTA. The sister is acting like an entitled brat. Block and go no contact with her for a long time.", "Oh, yeah just set it to a different time, like 10 in the morning. No wait than i have to wake him up too early and he will be grumpy, and wont be able to get his 12hour nappy. Maybe 4 in the afternoon? Hell no, thats too close to his dinnertime. \nYou know what, why dont you just set the wedding to a date when he's old enough not to nap?\n\nNTA, your sister sometimes just has to play with naptimes.", "NTA. Lisa is the arsehole. \n\nI have two kids, yea there is a nap schedule, for babies, not two year olds, and even if there was, it won't kill her to break it for a day, or get a sitter. I can't stand mums who think the world has to stop for their babies nap time. \n\nI know that some kids are a sleep nightmare, but the world still has to turn. \n\nEnjoy your wedding.", "If you acquiesce, she'll want more concessions. Don't back down. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nGuest : \"Why is Lisa note here?\"  \nBride : \"Her son needed a nap.\"  \nGuest : \"All day?\"  \nBride : \"No but during the ceremony, so she decided she couldn't attend the reception either.\"\n\nYeah, it sounds dumb.", "The only question that makes the answer obvious, can you really not change it to an hour later, if it just doesn't work you are nta, if it's just hassle for you.. YtA", "Ok, hear me out: I have two toddlers and I get Lisas problem. Tired toddlers are an absolute HORROR for everyone around them but even more so for the over tired parents who also get the benefit of recieving the hate and annoyed looks of other adults. Lisa could have been a bit more diplomatic but in her place I also wouldn't attend. Just off the most answers here I can tell you she made the right choice because if people can't even be empathetic enough to cut parents some slack for trying to prevent disaster on other peoples' wedding, imagine how they would have treated her when the toddler shit *really* hit the fan. YTA.", "I have the feeling she'd show up in a huge white dress if she did anyway.", "The in laws helping is a great idea. They\u2019d be able to enjoy the reception after the naps were over.", "Are you suggesting that Lisa is too shy/embarrassed to state her real feelings, and OP lacks the emotional intelligence to take the hint!? \n\nThat... seems unlikely.", "It's probably not even about the nap schedule,  but convincing someone else to do what LISA wants.  It's a power play. \nThat poor kid will have naps until he hits high school outta spite. \n\nI hope the wedding is fantastic.", "My sister suggested a venue for my wedding and fought with me to have it there because SHE wanted it there. And I obliged. Changed a couple of things, but still fit within HER parameters (she\u2019s the only family I used to talk to and that I had left). I asked my sister (a year in advance) if my wedding date was good with her and rearranged it by a few months to fit her schedule until she finally said yes, it was perfect. A couple of days later she tells me that she\u2019s three months pregnant and won\u2019t be able to attend. I tell her I totally get it and can still move the wedding to the following year so she could go and my future niece/nephew could attend as well (my wedding only has 15 people so a baby would be fine - it wouldn\u2019t be loud or noisy, we preferred small and intimate). Then she says it doesn\u2019t matter if I move my wedding because there\u2019s no way she\u2019s going\u2026and she wonders why I\u2019m upset.", "So curious what sort of decision she was trying to dictate lol", "My wife's almost step-father (they were together for 10 years and engaged but ended up splitting before tying the knot) didn't come to our wedding because \"It's my niece's birthday and I can't miss that!\"  He did show up to the reception partway through in a stained Nascar shirt and holey blue jeans.\n\nI'm eternally grateful to him for prioritizing that girls birthday because it means he is in ZERO of my wedding photos, and just a single picture from the reception where he isn't the focus of the picture.", "Absolutely, a few minutes at a time.", "What's my nap schedule several years from now? Sorry, I don't think I can make your Mars wedding in 2027.", "Mine wouldn't have, but both girls would have been fine not having a nap for 1 day.", "My husband and I wanted to start a family soon after we married, since I was almost 30yo and he was closer to 40 than 30. We decided that I would stay at home while he worked, since his job was way above mine in pay. I never told this coworker how much he made, or even offered any discussion. I just let her talk, since nothing was going to change her mind anyway.", "Or you know, do like OP suggested and come when the nap is over. So what if they miss the ceremony?", "I could understand no interruption to a set schedule but compromise to go to the reception, I don\u2019t get.", "'All the people she trusts will be at the wedding\", maybe she doesn't trust her own husband to look after the kid?", "That\u2019s what I did for my cousins wedding. Husband started with toddler for nap during the ceremony and they joined for reception.  My 2 year was happy and all 3 of us enjoyed the reception.", "Phone set to \"world correct time\" aka daylight savings and EVERY SINGLE clock inside the house is set to \"house time\" aka non daylight time. Just put a sign on your front door along the lines of \"this door is a time portal, upon entry you will be transported 'x' hours into the future/past\" what ever is relevant for your time zone. \n\nWhy not have fun with it, you get to keep your day schedule and visitors are warned before entry so can't complain if they are late/earlier to something.", "I was attending a funeral service where the tiniest, quietest, most chill baby ever suddenly cut loose with a gas explosion with all the sound and fury of a grown man in a Taco Bell restroom-- then yawned and fell asleep in his dad's arms.\n\nThe parents were horrified, everyone was silent and like *wtf, how do we react*\\-- until the minister reminded all of us that the deceased LOVED humor like that and surely he was splitting his sides laughing in heaven.\n\nThe atmosphere following that moment was still quite somber, but felt a lot lighter, like we were still allowed to remember all the \"pull my finger\" jokes alongside our heartbreak.", "i rather think that Lisa enjoys the kind of attention it brings to her how \"her sister, her own flesh and blood, purposely excludes her from her wedding by not respecting her toddler's nap\". some people love to complain and play the victim.", "Yup, in the carrier or in the stroller for the nap.", "NTA.\n\nSome people wouldn't allow a two-year-old at their wedding **at all**. At least you did include him in the invitation. Can you imagine the fuss Lisa would have kicked up if you'd decided to have a childfree wedding?\n\nYou mentioned a couple of very reasonable compromises, and Lisa rejected them. She could also use a professional babysitting service if she really wanted, if all her usual babysitters were attending the wedding.\n\n*\\[She\\] said that everyone is going to ask why she's not there*\n\nIf Lisa is anything like one of my sisters, they'll probably be relieved she's not there.\n\n*I snapped at her and told her the world doesn't revolve around her and her son.*\n\nDamn right.\n\n*My mom is pestering me to make ammends with Lisa but I just don't think I'm in the wrong.*\n\nYou're not. Lisa is a narcissist.\n\nI suspect part of the reason why Lisa thinks the whole world should accommodate her demands is that your mother has always enabled her narcissism, to keep the peace.", "Op, PLEASE send this link to your sister!

For belittling her reasoning and refusing to see her point of you you are TA.\n\nHowever, for being unwilling to even compromise a little to your suggestions makes her TA.

She said she couldn't, if she can't it's her point", "It\u2019s not even the nap, it\u2019s not having time to get him ready AFTER the nap. So they could pack his nice clothes and stick him in the car in his pjs and I\u2019m sure the venue could find a bathroom or other space where dad could change the kid while mom watches the ceremony.
