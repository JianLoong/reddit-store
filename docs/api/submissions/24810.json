I find it pretty rich that ur dad wants you to set \u201can example\u201d of behavior when he cheated on your mom and divorced her. You are free to establish whatever type of relationship you want with your bio-bro, to the exclusion of dad, stepmom, etc. You\u2019re GROWN. It\u2019s totally ok to have boundaries with family.

If your stepmom is already upset that you arent spending as much money  on her precious child as on your brother, i wouldnt put it past your stepmom to destroy it or to insist her son gets to play whenever he wants, to the exclusion of your brother.\n\nJust out of curiosity,  does your stepmom ever buy you gifts?

He's the kid of a friend of the family as far as your interactions with him go, and that's it. You are under no obligation to do anything for him. Your brother is your family. \n\nTo expect you to invest as much time/effort/money on your stepmother's son is completely ridiculous. \n\nYour brother's interactions with your stepbrother will be, and should be, different, since they live together part time.", "NTA.

There\u2019d have been less drama if you gave your brother his gift at your mom\u2019s house  no matter where his party was.

Sort of sucks that you decided unilaterally that your brother can't have his PS5 at his dad's house because you don't like that they'll force him to share, but if he's fine with it, whatever", "NAH. I don't think you're an asshole but you could learn how to be more tactful. \n\nA $25 Amazon card is about as low effort that you can go, you can do better than that without even spending more money. You could have also given your brother the PlayStation in private instead of in front of your other brother that just got a $25 gift card.
