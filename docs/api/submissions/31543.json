Thank you for standing up for your wife. It is apparent that no one in her family does. Side note, who TF asks 22 year olds about kids?!", "ESH but your MIL is the far bigger AH.  Good for your for sticking up for your wife. But what you\u2019re seeing is that by yelling and pounding on the table, everyone is focusing on the delivery and not the message.   It would have been more effective to deliver the same message in a calmer way.  \nYour MIL will now only focus on your behavior, but she probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten the message anyway!!", "NTA, however you could have politely put forth your point of view instead of yelling", "how can it be subtle, passive aggressive comments while being constant barrage of belittling questions?\n\nwhy is she concerned about fertility problems when she's barely old enough to drink legally?", "Where is this the norm to get married and have kids so young?", "NTA for standing up for your wife, ESH everywhere else. Your 1 aggressive support is not going to mend their relationship, and you definitely don\u2019t want to make their relationship worse. I think hitting the table was unnecessary. Continue supporting your wife", "NTA - good luck though. The whole family sounds toxic and maybe low contact would be good for a while. Suggest she apologize to your wife first.", "NTA\n\nBut a better way to have handled it would have been to leave before your wife got to the point of tearing up. You should have gotten up from the table, helped your wife with her chair and said, \"We'll be leaving now as I cannot let you treat my wife like that.\"", "NTA. Who cares about the delivery - you would have been accused of the same thing regardless of how you said it. They weren\u2019t in a space to receive that message, and would\u2019ve found any reason to pick it apart, rather than focus on what you said. I\u2019m so glad to hear you stuck up for your wife, and I hope you all are going low/no contact with her family moving forward.

The bigger issue is that you both need to seek out some professional help to learn how to better deal with her actions, since apparently your wife's dad just let her steamroll over him as well as the rest of the family.  In the end it needs to come from your wife in dealing with her and it's great that you're defending her, but she needs to learn to build up her own confidence to do it herself as well.", "NTA I understand your reaction might have been intense, and if it's important to your wife, you should be willing to apologize for the outburst. However, stand by the fact that the way your mother-in-law treats her daughter is unacceptable. It hurts to see your wife upset, and state that if anyone owes an apology for hurtful comments, it's her.", "ESH (you only for your physical outburst which may have been scary to others who hadn't been participating in the BS), but your MIL ITA.  \n\n\nYou're young, but as others have said - it's not very productive what you said.  Things that can be more productive include -   \n\"Mind your own business\"  \n\"If we decide to have kids you'll find out because we'll tell you\"  \n\"I'd appreciate if you not ever open your mouth again about my wife's weight or body because it's none of your business about how anybody looks but yourself.\"  \n\"I don't know about your daughter, but the way you act makes me not want to come back here, so you might want to factor that in to what you say from now on.\"  \n\n\nUsing firm no nonsense statements that can't be responded to in a way that requires you to engage further about it sounds like a skill you can cultivate. People who act like that can be shut down, and you don't have to do anything other than ignore anything they say after that if it's not an apology or acknowledgement that they were out of line.", "ESH\n\n\u201cI hit the table \u2026\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when you joined your MIL as a co-asshole.\n\n\u201c \u2026 and screamed at my MIL \u2026 \u201c\n\nAnd that\u2019s when you solidified it.\n\nYou both need to apologise.\n\nAnd if apologies are accepted and dinner invitations recommence, you need to make a plan with your wife about what you will do next time she starts in like that. A plan that does not include violent displays and screaming.", "NTA. Hindsight is 20/20 and next time you might be able to come up with a more calm response and even stop it way sooner. However, no need to apologize for this time because it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve ever acted this way and without any practice or forethought, you just reacted instinctively in order to defend your wife. So never doubt defending/protecting someone you love. \n\nI would however, insist to mil and any family member that if she doesn\u2019t apologize and make things right you both may go low or no contact. And if the family members don\u2019t support that, then they need to be called out for supporting an abuser and not protecting their own daughter/sister/family", "Who cares about the delivery - he would have been accused of the same thing regardless of how he said it. They weren\u2019t in a space to receive his message, and would\u2019ve found any reason to pick it apart, rather than focus on what he said.", "Came here to say the same thing. I can appreciate the build up and that resulting in yelling, I\u2019m of the mindset that I cannot lose control of myself in that way otherwise it feels like I\u2019ve placed the control of my emotions in the hands of the person I\u2019m angry at. \n\nWhich makes me wonder, do you apologize for raising your voice but not for your words. Is there a way for you to share with them what you felt, and the boundaries you want to establish in a manner they\u2019re able to listen to. \n\nAlso, good for you for standing by your spouse! We need to do that sometimes for our partners. Too often they\u2019re used to taking a verbal attack, or just want to keep the peace at their expense. We all need an advocate", "Should have clarified. I meant to say that the passive-aggressive remarks consistently undermined and belittled, with my MIL showing no signs of stopping. Sorry for any confusion. \n\nMIL strongly believes in starting a family before careers. We've been married for a little more than year and a half, and she has said that we're \"behind\" and shit."]}
