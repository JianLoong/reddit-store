Good for your for sticking up for your wife. But what you\u2019re seeing is that by yelling and pounding on the table, everyone is focusing on the delivery and not the message.

Continue supporting your wife", "NTA - good luck though. The whole family sounds toxic and maybe low contact would be good for a while. Suggest she apologize to your wife first.", "NTA\n\nBut a better way to have handled it would have been to leave before your wife got to the point of tearing up. You should have gotten up from the table, helped your wife with her chair and said, \"We'll be leaving now as I cannot let you treat my wife like that.\"", "NTA. Who cares about the delivery - you would have been accused of the same thing regardless of how you said it. They weren\u2019t in a space to receive that message, and would\u2019ve found any reason to pick it apart, rather than focus on what you said. I\u2019m so glad to hear you stuck up for your wife, and I hope you all are going low/no contact with her family moving forward.

The bigger issue is that you both need to seek out some professional help to learn how to better deal with her actions, since apparently your wife's dad just let her steamroll over him as well as the rest of the family.  In the end it needs to come from your wife in dealing with her and it's great that you're defending her, but she needs to learn to build up her own confidence to do it herself as well.", "NTA I understand your reaction might have been intense, and if it's important to your wife, you should be willing to apologize for the outburst. However, stand by the fact that the way your mother-in-law treats her daughter is unacceptable. It hurts to see your wife upset, and state that if anyone owes an apology for hurtful comments, it's her.", "ESH (you only for your physical outburst which may have been scary to others who hadn't been participating in the BS), but your MIL ITA.  \n\n\nYou're young, but as others have said - it's not very productive what you said.  Things that can be more productive include -   \n\"Mind your own business\"  \n\"If we decide to have kids you'll find out because we'll tell you\"  \n\"I'd appreciate if you not ever open your mouth again about my wife's weight or body because it's none of your business about how anybody looks but yourself.\"  \n\"I don't know about your daughter, but the way you act makes me not want to come back here, so you might want to factor that in to what you say from now on.\"  \n\n\nUsing firm no nonsense statements that can't be responded to in a way that requires you to engage further about it sounds like a skill you can cultivate. People who act like that can be shut down, and you don't have to do anything other than ignore anything they say after that if it's not an apology or acknowledgement that they were out of line.", "ESH\n\n\u201cI hit the table \u2026\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when you joined your MIL as a co-asshole.\n\n\u201c \u2026 and screamed at my MIL \u2026 \u201c\n\nAnd that\u2019s when you solidified it.\n\nYou both need to apologise.\n\nAnd if apologies are accepted and dinner invitations recommence, you need to make a plan with your wife about what you will do next time she starts in like that. A plan that does not include violent displays and screaming.", "NTA. Hindsight is 20/20 and next time you might be able to come up with a more calm response and even stop it way sooner. However, no need to apologize for this time because it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve ever acted this way and without any practice or forethought, you just reacted instinctively in order to defend your wife. So never doubt defending/protecting someone you love. \n\nI would however, insist to mil and any family member that if she doesn\u2019t apologize and make things right you both may go low or no contact. And if the family members don\u2019t support that, then they need to be called out for supporting an abuser and not protecting their own daughter/sister/family", "Who cares about the delivery - he would have been accused of the same thing regardless of how he said it. They weren\u2019t in a space to receive his message, and would\u2019ve found any reason to pick it apart, rather than focus on what he said.", "Came here to say the same thing. I can appreciate the build up and that resulting in yelling, I\u2019m of the mindset that I cannot lose control of myself in that way otherwise it feels like I\u2019ve placed the control of my emotions in the hands of the person I\u2019m angry at. \n\nWhich makes me wonder, do you apologize for raising your voice but not for your words. Is there a way for you to share with them what you felt, and the boundaries you want to establish in a manner they\u2019re able to listen to. \n\nAlso, good for you for standing by your spouse! We need to do that sometimes for our partners. Too often they\u2019re used to taking a verbal attack, or just want to keep the peace at their expense. We all need an advocate", "Should have clarified. I meant to say that the passive-aggressive remarks consistently undermined and belittled, with my MIL showing no signs of stopping. Sorry for any confusion. \n\nMIL strongly believes in starting a family before careers. We've been married for a little more than year and a half, and she has said that we're \"behind\" and shit.", "Wrong way to do it, but your intent was good. NTA - and you are right to defend your wife from this bullying", "No apology necessary stick to what you said she never gets contact with any future kids", "NTA but you have chosen the wrong way. People who act that way are not beaten by aggression, they just retreat with their tail between their legs and plot their next attack. Yes state your position but there is a lot of subtle undermining and passive aggression that you need to do to get her to the point where SHE kicks off in an inexplicable and inexcusable way and then you've won because she can't walk it back. You need to create leverage for yourself here.", "NTA, your poor wife!! Thank goodness she has you to stand up for her. Don\u2019t apologise, her mother should be the only one apologising", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA, because while your delivery was about as subtle as a lead pipe, it sounded pretty justified.", "It\u2019s preferable to format well placed cruel and vindictive comments, thinly veiled, to guilt trip her. Smile next time and hit her in her weak spots. Take a Master Class in acting if necessary. Inflict psychological damage. Revenge passive aggression is a dinner still warm for everyone else. They will appreciate your new role: successful villain.", "ESH.\n\nMIL is clearly a problem and you're right to stick up for your partner. However, the way you did this wasn't helpful. Slamming on the table and screaming? You need to get some self control.", "NTA. You are a great husband", "While your anger is understandable and it's commendable you stood up for your wife...your outburst was still inappropriate.  The better course of action would have been for you to simply stand up, explain to your wife that you're leaving, and tell MIL that neither of you will be seeing/speaking to her until she becomes more civil.", "NTA. Good for you! Your wife probably does not feel she has enough power in their relationship to say it herself or has been conditioned to back down. I\u2019m proud of you for sticking up for her, because no one deserves to be talked to like that by anyone especially family.", "ESH", "NTA your wife\u2019s family are AH protect your wife she\u2019s your family now", "the same people who get mad when a 22 year old gets pregnant/has kids because they're \"too young\"", "I was 21 when I got married. 2/3 of my graduating class had already gotten married, and half of those had starting having kids. I honestly thought I would never find a husband,  and felt like I waited FOREVER to find love. Ugh, so ridiculous! It was the culture in small town Idaho, though. Big Mormon community.", "Yea I'm amazed that few comments are picking up on this. Losing control like that is not ok.", "You still married?", "NTA your wife isn't either. Tell Mil she made the decision for herself she needs to keep her nose out of your business period", "ESH. When people show themselves unworthy of our company, we deprive them of the said company. Not descend to their level.", "*<Most of my wife\u2019s side of the family is accusing me of overreacting and demanding I apologize. Should I?>*\n\nYour MIL has a history of treating your wife this way. Her side of the family MUST know that. They just choose to \"not rock the boat\", becoming enablers.

MIL is the one to appologize, as do the enablers for letting your wife being treated that way.\n\nAnd yes, in the current situation, do keep MIL and enablers AWAY from future children.\n\nNTA", "Generally speaking: NTA. \n\nYou were 100% correct in defending your wife from being bullied this way. Because even if it was \"low-key\" side remarks, they apparently went on the entire evening to the point where your wife was close to tears. Having to deal with something like this from her own mother is just unforgiveable. You are right for calling her out in front of everyone. \n\nHowever, maybe it could be argued somewhat that you did overreact a little bit in telling her that she will never be able to see her own grandchildren. (Even though I can understand where you're coming from.)", "NTA... I dont agree with the aggresive displays and yelling, but standing up for your wife and calling out your mom is appropriate.  \n\nA Quiet deliberate rebuke at the table would have been appropriate.  If she didnt get it, walking out is the next step.", "Well I can 100% understand your feelings, perhaps don't go back and if you do don't bang on the table, just get up and leave with your wife. NTA", "NTA. Your wife has needed someone in her corner her whole life and good on you for being her hero! The rest of the family are enabling your MIL\u2019s abusive behavior.", "Fuck them.", "NTA, your MIL chose to treat her daughter horribly in front of everyone. You politely tried to redirect the conversation, but she wouldn\u2019t let you. She persisted and got a response accordingly. Honestly, it\u2019s time to go NC. This woman sounds horrible. The rest of the family can be reminded that they did nothing while they witnessed your wife being verbally abused and that says more about their character than yours. \n\nYou are a hero!", "NTA of course they would say apologize and ignore mils actions. Speak to your wife about setting boundaries with her family. You definitely don't want people like that around if you do plan on children. Just with life in general you don't want people like that around.", "Tell them the same thing every time they do it. Don't back down from their bullying.", "DO NOT APOLOGIZE TO THAT TROLL!  Tell those defending her that they are disgusting human beings as well and will not be seeing any child you produce.  Don't bother with them either.", "NTA.  Good for you OP for defending your wife.  She's been treated like this all of her life and someone finally stood up for her.  I would apologize to anyone else at the dinner for raising your voice and screaming at someone.  Then I would ask each of them why they did nothing to defend or stand up for your wife.  \n\nAs for apologizing to your MIL, I'd tell them that will NEVER happen.  The only apology needs to come from your MIL and she needs to grovel at your wife's feet and beg for forgiveness.  Do not ever let her around any children you two have.  She's proven she'll treat their mother horribly, she'll probably treat them just as poorly.  Plus she'll run down their mother in front of them.  Nope, being an involved grandparent must be earned.  It is not a right conferred on your MIL by blood.  She has earned nothing but no contact.", "NTA.  You finally said what your wife has wanted to be able to say her entire life.  And if you DO have kids, DON'T let MIL near them, EVER.  She will do this to your wife in front of your kids and teach them to behave that way toward her, and toward others.", "Whatever you do, don't apologize! The witch needed to be taken down, and you're too be commended for protecting your wife. \n\nNTA", "I got married at 18. My friends averaged about 26/27 when they got married. It wasn't the norm but I was happy \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "\"Starting family before careers\" is so ass backwards, how are you supposed to pay to raise the kids without a halfway decent career??? Your MIL sucks and I'm happy you stood up for your wife"]}
