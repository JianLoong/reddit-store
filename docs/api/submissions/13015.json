IDK.\n\nEither way, NTA.", "NTA, I kinda understood (but not really) people of MY grandparents generation freaking out about stuff like that cause they were adults in the 50s (I'm now 40) and it was super conservative back then, but I call bullshit on this one. Women with shaved heads have been in popular culture/fashion for a REAL long time now (thinking GI Jane, Sinead O'Connor, some girl I knew in the late 90s) so freaking out about it, to me, is like someone freaking out about women showing their ankles in public. And that's not even considering the fact that it's to support a friend with cancer, which has ALSO been very common for a very long time. What is wrong with people?! Get with the times (and by the times I mean 25 years ago)", "NTA\n\nThe other thing dumber than people stressing out over big weddings would be people stressing out about vow renewals.  People need to get over themselves.  It's hair.", "They called you a brat but seem to expect you to live around them and their party. I wouldn\u2019t even go and call them out for being so self absorbed and having a closed minded idea of how people should look! What if you had the cancer or if your grandma did, would it matter then? Life shouldn\u2019t be about others standards and if you do go make sure you tell others that your lack of hair was for a cancer patient, see how many elder people there who went through or live with it applaud you\u2026NTA", "NTA, supporting your friend is more important than trying to impress your grandma's friends. That's not selfish that's very nice of you. Plus, if someone's criticizing you, I feel like your grandma should maybe...defend her grandkid? Idk\n\nI wish your friend all the best.", "NTA but grandma sure is. If she's so worried about what her friends think, she can buy you a nice wig for the day. Or explain to her friends how you're supporting someone you care about, which would be the better option.", "We have those posed photos from my grandparent's 40th, so I know what you're talking about.\n\nYou can tell her that you hope she'll look back at those photos in 20 or 30 years and see your head and be really proud of you.\n\nYou doing that is a testament to their marriage after all - they raised special kids, who raised special kids. You can tell her that your confidence comes from your family, and you are grateful for it. And hope she will be proud of you like this, and be excited to look back on this memory.\n\nI would be.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYikes. I\u2019m sorry she said those things to you. You sound like a great kid and they should be proud to have a grandchild who supports their friend any way they can.", "NTA you are a good friend.... if theu worried about their friends then i wouldn't go...", "NTA. Your grandparents are being selfish brats for caring what their friends will think. When their friends ask and you tell them, I'm sure they'll think the same thing I do, that you're a very sweet and supportive friend.", "Nta. If your grandmother keeps making a big deal out of if the just get a wig. Make it a loud color just to mess with her.", "NTA.\r  \n\r  \nYou shaved your head to show support for your best friend who is going through a difficult time with cancer. That is an incredibly kind and selfless gesture that shows your love and support for her. Your grandma's reaction was insensitive and selfish. It's not about what her friends will think, but about showing compassion and solidarity with someone you care about.\r  \n\r  \nIt's also great to hear that your dad was supportive of your decision. Ultimately, it was your choice to shave your head, and you had good intentions behind it. You are not being a brat or selfish, you are showing empathy and love towards your best friend.", "Your grandparents should be thankful that they have a healthy granddaughter.", "NTA.\n\nRespect for you and good luck to your friend!", "NTA.   Imagine being so childish and sensitive that you actually think your friends will negatively judge you because somebody else is bald. Your grandparents are beyond ridiculous.", "Anyone who thinks you are something other than a kind, empathetic person who cares about their friend is a person who is not worth thinking about. NTA.", "HEHE vowel renewal... Can't even blame that on autocorrect", "Thank you", "That's what I think...", "My dad is very chill but I mostly wanted to make sure he was aware and cool with it... He knows my hair will eventually grow back", "This. Don't support \"family\" who treat you like this. Hopefully your dad understands.", "Thank you", "My grandparents are very very traditional... They don't like tattoos piercings, girls with shaved heads, certain styles of clothing (ripped jeans, lounge clothes, crop tops, even graphic tees)  and so much more... They're my material grandparents my mom passed away when I was only 2... They've always hated my dad because he has tattoos and doesn't have a respectable job in there eyes and thought he was a bad influence on my mom as well as me now", "My dad told them that", "I feel so stupid for doing that \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
