IDK.\n\nEither way, NTA.", "NTA, I kinda understood (but not really) people of MY grandparents generation freaking out about stuff like that cause they were adults in the 50s (I'm now 40) and it was super conservative back then, but I call bullshit on this one. Women with shaved heads have been in popular culture/fashion for a REAL long time now (thinking GI Jane, Sinead O'Connor, some girl I knew in the late 90s) so freaking out about it, to me, is like someone freaking out about women showing their ankles in public. And that's not even considering the fact that it's to support a friend with cancer, which has ALSO been very common for a very long time. What is wrong with people?! Get with the times (and by the times I mean 25 years ago)", "NTA\n\nThe other thing dumber than people stressing out over big weddings would be people stressing out about vow renewals.  People need to get over themselves.  It's hair.", "They called you a brat but seem to expect you to live around them and their party. I wouldn\u2019t even go and call them out for being so self absorbed and having a closed minded idea of how people should look!

And I think it\u2019s pretty bold of your grandma to assume this was some sort of act of rebellion, specifically to sabotage their wedding vow renewals? Good on you for being such a supportive friend, I did something similar when my niece was diagnosed and the outpouring of support after was amazing! I\u2019m sure it was/will be for you too :)", "NTA. The family \"events\" that people make up to draw attention to themselves and bully everyone are ridiculous.

They don't have to drag you into it.\n\nPersonally I think vow renewals are silly because wedding vows don't need renewing.", "NTA you did the right thing.
