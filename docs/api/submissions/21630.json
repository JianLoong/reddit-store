NTA I think she was looking for an easy bailout.", "NTA\n\nShe told you eating meat was ok, so you ate your usual meal with her family.\n\nShe's either clueless or not a nice person and set you up.\n\nNeither of those is an admirable quality in a long term partner.\n\nHugs and Good Luck", "NTA, pack up the rest of her stuff and send it to her.  Never speak with her again.", "NTA - You asked her.", "NTA\n\nYou asked.   \n\nAnd even if you didn't they can't expect you to share their dietary restrictions.", "NTA. You were thoughtful enough to ask. She was thoughtless enough to lie to you. You dodged a bullet. Move on from her - she's quite the manipulator.", "NTA\n\nHonestly it really sounds like she set you up. You literally asked her, and she said it was fine, and then used her family's reaction as an excuse to bail.", "NTA she played you like a damn fiddle.", "NTA\n\nThe way I see it there are three possibilities. \n\n1 she\u2019s an idiot. \n\n2 She was looking for an easy out. \n\n3 she likes to play mind games. \n\nNone of these qualities are a good sign.", "NTA it sounds clear to me one of two things happened:\n\n1. She was already looking for an out\n\n2. She didn\u2019t think just you eating it would be an issue, but it made her parents question her religious values and belief system and have enough power over her that she is scared she has to choose if she loses you or them and is getting manipulated a bit to choose them", "NTA. Your gf told you it was fine and then immediately pivoted? Don't feel bad about it.", "NTA, just hope you got that in writing in case rumors start about you being an doing that. Overall not a huge deal rumor wise, but it would be a good clap back in case anyone like mutual friends gives you shit.", "NTA. I don't necessarily think you got played. Maybe. But possibly she's cool with you eating beef, but her family wasn't and pressured her into ending it. In a lot of cultures, the family holds a lot of cards. \n\nI'd probably reach out one time to ask what the deal was, and that's it. Don't beg. Simply ask.", "NTA she baited you bro, im so sorry that sucks even if you have thick skin", "NTA I think she underestimated how hostile the family would be to it. And I guarantee that after you left, her family was coming at her hard because they\u2019ll take it as a sign of her losing her values and religious beliefs that she\u2019d date you when you so openly eat meat. On her own, I bet she didn\u2019t care. But the family pressure can be unbearable.", "Info: was it the meat or was it because the meat was beef?", "NTA- You did your part. Hate to say it but you got played. Move on bro.", "NTA I feel like she set you up.  You asked and she gave you the ok, but she was pretty quick to leave afterwards.  I think she was just looking for a reason.", "NTA wow she really set you up. I\u2019m so sorry. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA - she set you up for an out.. or did this methodically for some real weird reason", "NTA. Even if you didn't ask her and had meat at the restaurant, you wouldn't be an asshole. If they were so bothered by other people eating beef, they should have gone to a vegan restaurant instead. The only way you might have been an AH is if you deliberately took beef into their home or something.", "Nta break up w her and move on.", "NTA. You asked if it was OK, she said yes, so you did it. Either she lied, or misjudged what their response would be herself, but even then that wouldn't explain the sudden need for a break.", "NTA. You go aren\u2019t compatible. Break up and go your separate ways. Sorry dude.", "NTA. Definitely not worth the stress.", "NTA, you shouldn\u2019t have to change diet based on someone\u2019s feelings.", "NTA\n\nYou asked her beforehand if that would be an issue, and she told you it won't be.", "Who tf imposes their diet on other people?  So weird.", "NTA regardless of communication before the meal.  People can choose not to eat ham, beef, meat, etc.  They can choose to be a vegan.  Their choices should be respected.  They can't tell others, in a public place, what they can or can't eat.  The family in this case were the intolerant ones, OP was in the right.", "Bro as a Indian i would tell you that you are absolutely not the ah here. We consider cow as sacred and hence don't eat it. It was not not about meat, it was about beef. \nYour girlfriend was probably cheating and wanted a easy way out by not tarnishing her reputation, thats why she played you.", "If your GF is an Indian Hindu, the beef may have been the point of conflict, not so much the concept of meat itself. That being said, she's rubbish at communicating clearly and you may have actually dodged a bullet. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nShe's a liar.  Pack the rest of her shit up for her and then order a bucket of chicken to eat when she arrives to get her stuff.", "Don\u2019t take it!! That culture crap is f*n off the chain!! They are demented!", "NTA\n\nYou asked her opinion, it was unfortunately wrong. Now she's bowing to family pressure. Bro, you dodged a bullet.

Also, many South Indians eat beef too regardless of being Hindu.\n\nSo going forward, if you end up with another Indian, you might wanna confirm her dietary background beforehand.", "Indian woman here! \n\nYou\u2019re obviously NTA here. I\u2019m assuming the girlfriend is Hindu since her parents seem to have a problem with beef. Some Hindus get offended if someone consumes meet as the religion treats cows at par with a goddess. \n\nBut that\u2019s their problem and no reason to impose their dietary preferences on you. You can obviously eat what you want and did nothing wrong in ordering a beef burger (and you checked with your girlfriend before hand??). \n\nSeems like it\u2019s a family issue they need to sort out and are using you to pin it on, don\u2019t get involved in that and enjoy your food.", "And ...what? She decided to get her family, acting troupe style, to pretend that they were aggrieved that he was eating meat, being upset and asking him to leave. Just so she could later bail out of the relationship without the drama .\n\nIt sounds pretty dramatic to me", "Beef fs, I am Indian and if their family follows Hinduism then beef is a big No No", "It\u2019s not about how much meat, it\u2019s about beef. Hindus don\u2019t eat cow. (Not everyone in India is a Hindu).", "I doubt she had to get her family to do anything - they were likely genuinely upset. \n\nCows are sacred in much of India. While it isn't a secret that others eat cows still, eating beef in front of a family that holds that belief while meeting that family for the first time because you're dating their kid...yeah, that would result in a less than stellar first impression. Since they didn't know he had been told it was okay, OP's behaviour could have been perceived as a lack of consideration or even outright disrespect for their culture.\n\nAnd obviously OP's ex would have known that this would upset her family.

Jesus..... what a leap you took there.", "I'm an Indian here but if I would have been at your place and got shamed for ordering meat i would have stayed seated eating the food asking them to leave or eat elsewhere or I go to other table and eat non veg within their eyesight because -\n1. You were not wrong\n2. They were disrespectful(could have sincerely asked you to order veg food)\n3. Their daughter and probably they too are assholes.", "NTA. She was probably looking for an out and knew her family would start bitching if you ordered meat", "Clearly NTA\n\nYou asked and she said it is okay. And now she turned. \nI am from India, brahmin family where eating meat is blasphemous and beef is like super sin kind of thing for us. But I have never bothered about it if my husband eats it. He enjoys all type of non veg and I am total vegetarian. \n\nMy family does not like it one bit if he eats meat but well that is their problem. He of course does not eat meat in their house nor does he eat during religious festivals. But apart from that they cannot dictate what he eats and doesn't especially in our house. They initially insisted that our house be meat free so that they can come and eat freely without any issues. That was just not acceptable to me and I told my parents they are free to not visit us ever if they are going to dictate our life.", "Red Flag", "Who goes to an all you can eat and just gets a salad?", "NAH, i say go ahead & celebrate the breakup with a big juicy porterhouse steak", "Not compatible", "Was the confusion here that you asked if you could have meat and she assumed you would pick chicken or lamb or anything non-beef.", "NTA.\n\n>I asked her about when we are going to dinner with her family and if I need to have non-meat but she claims that they don't mind me having meat so I said OK and left for a drive.\r  \n\r\n\nYou did everything right in this story.

It's an a-hole move on her part. \nIf she wanted out. For whatever reason. She should sit down and have a talk. Not invite him to meet the family.\nIf it was a test - seriously.
