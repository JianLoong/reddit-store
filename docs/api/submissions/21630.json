NTA I think she was looking for an easy bailout.", "NTA\n\nShe told you eating meat was ok, so you ate your usual meal with her family.\n\nShe's either clueless or not a nice person and set you up.\n\nNeither of those is an admirable quality in a long term partner.\n\nHugs and Good Luck", "NTA, pack up the rest of her stuff and send it to her.  Never speak with her again.", "NTA - You asked her.", "NTA\n\nYou asked.   \n\nAnd even if you didn't they can't expect you to share their dietary restrictions.", "NTA. You were thoughtful enough to ask. She was thoughtless enough to lie to you. You dodged a bullet. Move on from her - she's quite the manipulator.", "NTA\n\nHonestly it really sounds like she set you up. You literally asked her, and she said it was fine, and then used her family's reaction as an excuse to bail.", "NTA she played you like a damn fiddle.", "NTA\n\nThe way I see it there are three possibilities. \n\n1 she\u2019s an idiot. \n\n2 She was looking for an easy out. \n\n3 she likes to play mind games. \n\nNone of these qualities are a good sign.", "NTA it sounds clear to me one of two things happened:\n\n1. She was already looking for an out\n\n2. She didn\u2019t think just you eating it would be an issue, but it made her parents question her religious values and belief system and have enough power over her that she is scared she has to choose if she loses you or them and is getting manipulated a bit to choose them", "NTA. Your gf told you it was fine and then immediately pivoted? Don't feel bad about it.", "NTA, just hope you got that in writing in case rumors start about you being an doing that. Overall not a huge deal rumor wise, but it would be a good clap back in case anyone like mutual friends gives you shit.", "NTA. I don't necessarily think you got played. Maybe. But possibly she's cool with you eating beef, but her family wasn't and pressured her into ending it. In a lot of cultures, the family holds a lot of cards. \n\nI'd probably reach out one time to ask what the deal was, and that's it. Don't beg. Simply ask.", "NTA she baited you bro, im so sorry that sucks even if you have thick skin", "NTA I think she underestimated how hostile the family would be to it. And I guarantee that after you left, her family was coming at her hard because they\u2019ll take it as a sign of her losing her values and religious beliefs that she\u2019d date you when you so openly eat meat. On her own, I bet she didn\u2019t care. But the family pressure can be unbearable.", "Info: was it the meat or was it because the meat was beef?", "NTA- You did your part. Hate to say it but you got played. Move on bro.", "NTA I feel like she set you up.  You asked and she gave you the ok, but she was pretty quick to leave afterwards.  I think she was just looking for a reason.", "NTA wow she really set you up. I\u2019m so sorry. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA - she set you up for an out.. or did this methodically for some real weird reason", "NTA. Even if you didn't ask her and had meat at the restaurant, you wouldn't be an asshole. If they were so bothered by other people eating beef, they should have gone to a vegan restaurant instead. The only way you might have been an AH is if you deliberately took beef into their home or something.", "Nta break up w her and move on.", "NTA. You asked if it was OK, she said yes, so you did it. Either she lied, or misjudged what their response would be herself, but even then that wouldn't explain the sudden need for a break.", "NTA. You go aren\u2019t compatible. Break up and go your separate ways. Sorry dude.", "NTA. Definitely not worth the stress.", "NTA, you shouldn\u2019t have to change diet based on someone\u2019s feelings.", "NTA\n\nYou asked her beforehand if that would be an issue, and she told you it won't be.", "Who tf imposes their diet on other people?  So weird.", "NTA regardless of communication before the meal.  People can choose not to eat ham, beef, meat, etc.  They can choose to be a vegan.  Their choices should be respected.  They can't tell others, in a public place, what they can or can't eat.  The family in this case were the intolerant ones, OP was in the right.", "Bro as a Indian i would tell you that you are absolutely not the ah here. We consider cow as sacred and hence don't eat it. It was not not about meat, it was about beef. \nYour girlfriend was probably cheating and wanted a easy way out by not tarnishing her reputation, thats why she played you.", "If your GF is an Indian Hindu, the beef may have been the point of conflict, not so much the concept of meat itself. That being said, she's rubbish at communicating clearly and you may have actually dodged a bullet. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nShe's a liar.  Pack the rest of her shit up for her and then order a bucket of chicken to eat when she arrives to get her stuff.", "Don\u2019t take it!! That culture crap is f*n off the chain!! They are demented!", "NTA\n\nYou asked her opinion, it was unfortunately wrong. Now she's bowing to family pressure. Bro, you dodged a bullet. Try again, you'll find the right lady for you.", "YTA\n\nThe problem wasn't \"meat\", it's \"beef\".\n\nThat you don't know that after some months is a shame.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
