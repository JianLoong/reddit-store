I used to work in guest services. So let\u2019s say someone booked the ADA room and wanted to stay an extra night. Unfortunately, I would tell them they would need to switch rooms OR that we can\u2019t accommodate the additional night. Why? Because you don\u2019t know the situation of the person coming in but you have to assume they need the specific features.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s no way to know who made that call, and sometimes things like guest \u201cstatus\u201d (Like, VIP) might mean you have to be extra accommodating to them. It\u2019s a very political and weird place to be with a lot of judgment around which guest you think will be the most flexible. \n\nAlso, guess what - people would lose it on us ALL THE TIME! Generally speaking we would know all those things, that people are tired from traveling, that they aren\u2019t at their best, that someone made a judgement call that may not have been the best one. \n\nSo don\u2019t sweat it. Nobody is crying at night because you yelled at them. Hopefully they got you all sorted out and it ends up working out for you and hubby.", "NTA, it shouldn't be harder for your husband to enjoy life too. But they wouldn't have done anything for you if you hadn't've yelled. You may feel bad, but that just means you aren't entirely crazy, you care. I'm proud of you.", "NTA. That sucks for you, but keep in mind, in most places, it's _very_ hard to get someone out of a hotel room they don't want to leave. You're right to be pissed and tell them exactly how this is affecting you. But it's possible their only option was calling a sheriff to drag someone out at gunpoint.", "NTA, your room should be free and this is BS. You had a confirmed booking. Call Corporate and tag on Insta/Twitter. This is unacceptable.", "NTA for raising the issue. They created a huge issue for you. They messed up and they know it. Potentially stuck in a rock and a hard place if the person who took the room for the extra night was a owner or someone highly influential but the room was already booked. Their hands were tied. \n\nYou maybe the AH for yelling but we don't know if the person on the phone was responsible for the mistake or just the messenger. This also occurred an hour before check in so no wonder you were rightly annoyed.", "NTA. That compensation seems fair for the hassle you are going through. They should have moved the other person.", "NTA. My husband had ALS and couldn\u2019t walk for 6 years. This happened to us twice and it was miserable to adjust for just one night. A wheelchair can\u2019t maneuver properly in regular room, getting to the toilet is impossible, there is no taking a shower which is awesome after a day of traveling, and we only traveled with one bed rail so the risk of falling off the other side was increased. Anyone telling you to get over it is wrong. Disabled travelers deserve to be as safe in their rooms as anyone else", "NTA. They did the wrong thing, you telling them they are wrong is good.", "YTA only in regards that you yelled at a front desk clerk who more than likely didn't even have a hand in the situation.

You don\u2019t know the circumstances as to why the other guest stayed the extra night. Could be medical, could be needing safe refuge, could be they were a regular patron who uses that room periodically. The hotel failed y\u2019all by picking winners and losers without disclosing their actual rationale, and while anyone would understand your annoyance, the front desk staff are HIGHLY UNLIKELY to be responsible for green lighting that decision. You just tore a strip off people who made the mistake of showing up for their shift.", "For going nuclear on the desk clerk, who likely had no hand in altering your room assignment, YTA.\n\nIn regards to being understandably pissed about getting screwed out of the room with the needed ADA accommodations, NTA.  Next time, try to avoid unleashing your fury on those that didn\u2019t have a direct hand in making your life more difficult.", "YTA. Not for the cause--you were totally in the right and deserved that room.\n\nHowever, you admit that you lost your shit on the desk clerk, a person who has literally no power in this moment.

All you accomplished in being nasty to her was making her day suck.", "YTA- there\u2019s never a reason to ever yell at staff.", "This is why I don\u2019t work in customer service", "NTA. They could have moved the other guest since he/she extended their stay.", "NTA.\n\nyou have every right to be annoyed at this as you paid for that room, they owed you the compensation for the room as the mistake was by them and not you. iv worked in the hotel industry and most of the time you will only be comped if you mention your are unhappy with the change of room.", "NTA I did night audit for three years and some nights it's your turn to eat the shit. It was good they comped you, I would've done the same.

Thanks.", "I love how people are down voting you for saying \"don't yell at people\" wtf is wrong with people?", "NTA. As someone who worked several years in hotel guest services, if a guest requests an ADA room, that should 100% be locked down first and foremost upon making the reservation. They should have blocked the room, make the keys, and seal that room away for the guest. There are always more than one ADA room and guests should ONLY be placed in ADA rooms upon request or unless the hotel is about to sell out. For exactly this reason. This is 100% on the staff, completely unprofessional.. So sorry for your troubles.", "NTA you paid for that room they should have made that guest move to a different room.", "Nta\u2026. I\u2019m sorry but sometimes being a career for a disabled person you have to let your inner bitch out because people just don\u2019t understand why we do the things we do like research and find specific hotel rooms to make our trip easier also book those rooms so far in advance it doesn\u2019t seem logical never feel guilty for advocating for your husband because if you don\u2019t who is going to I cared for my gran and still to this day (she passed 13 years ago) I bollock people parking in spots without badges until you\u2019ve had to use them and see the huge benefits they give wheel chair users it\u2019s not just them being closer to the shop", "NTA. My husband is also a paraplegic & we face non Ada rooms all the time. I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve yelled personally but business would\u2019ve been handled & things made right. Especially if the person who didn\u2019t want to check out wasn\u2019t wheelchair bound. They would\u2019ve been moved if I was the worker or straight up told sorry this room is no longer available point blank. That\u2019s what we are told when we try to book the rooms in the first place so applies to people who want to stay more too. The room is booked. Also Ada stuff is a joke in America. Anyone who made the rules & regulations has never spent a day in or with a disabled person especially a wheelchair user.", "My bf and I are seasoned travelers, and we have sometimes been put thru hell by front desk people just because we arrive late (only flights from our city arrive 8 hours before check-in or 4 hrs after). We have politely, but firmly, asserted our expectations when we arrived. On occasion they literally cannot accommodate our requests on the first night, but they almost always have offered some type of compensation and then we change rooms the next day. \n\nIt\u2019s perfectly acceptable to push for the accommodation(s) you need, as long as you\u2019re not, idk, in a screaming fight with the desk clerk.", "YTA.\n\nYou don't get to yell at people for stuff like this. Was it the clerk's fault? No. Was the clerk in any way responsible for this? No. So why are you making this person's life harder?\n\nYou don't get to just \"lose it\" on people because you're angry, especially when that person hasn't done \\*anything\\* wrong.", "I know this goes against what most people are saying but I'm going to say YTA. I only say this because I work in a hotel (albeit a cheap one) and I know what goes on behind the scenes. what this hotel did is ABSOLUTLY WRONG but taking it out on the clerk was an asshole move. she likely had nothing to do with the issue you are having. this is on the manager; it is the manager's job to be aware of the upcoming reservations and to deal with making arrangements in the event any overlap. that poor desk clerk was likely there for the afternoon shift if that's when you arrived and didn't even know the old guest had extended and didn't have the ability to do anything about it. that being said i think they should have awarded you the first night free as well as the second and awarded you whatever kind of points their system uses.", "INFO\n\nWas the clerk who called you the same person who made the decision to allocate you a different room?", "Mild YTA.\n\nNote: I have worked in the hotel industry for 2 decades.\n\nWhat they did is industry standard, extensions have priority over new reservations.   Honestly, the fact they called you ahead of time is admirable, many do not.  The people in the room also need that setup or they wouldn't have been in that room in the first place.  We understand that this situation can be stressful, I have had it more times than I can count, but sometimes shit happens.", "NTA I would be threatening to leave a very bad review if you did not get the room you booked. Why is one guest suddenly more important?", "NTA", "NTA. The ultimate assholes here are the politicians, for pitting disabled people against each other in a competition for artificially scarce resources. Every public accommodation should have been required to be accessible, period, so that disabled people can travel as freely as any other person. As it stands, if the other guest genuinely needs an ADA room too, it's an impossible situation all around, because the politicians were chickenshits. That said, the hotel chose to not build more ADA rooms than the bare minimum. They should have offered you the biggest room in the hotel, comped it, and asked for a list of equipment to rent for that night at hotel expense. Shoehorning you into a patently unsafe room is not acceptable, and charging anything whatsoever for it is galling. So of course you were frustrated. Yelling is of course generally not okay, but here they potentially are endangering the safety of a very vulnerable person. That's a situation that merits raising voice when they have failed to grasp the seriousness of their (in)action.", "NTA  \nif you didn't blow up at her you'd have been paying the full amount and still having to put up with everything else, the person that wanted to stay should have been moved to another room, as that room was already booked", "ESH. The guest who didn't want to leave is an AH, but you shouldn't go all Demon Mode on the receptionist for something not her fault but at least you admitted your mistake", "Extensions have priority over new reservations.  That's the industry standard.\n\nEdit:  wow, so many people that either don't work in hotels or are wrong. For your information, I have worked at and / or managed hotels in pretty much every major chain and this is the issue standard. Yes, if there is a way to accommodate the person that should be done but the extension has priority.\n\nHowever, the thing the hotel should have done was offered to walk them to another property that fits their requirements.", "Exactly. With the other guest it should have been more like \"we have another room available you can move to if you wish to extend your stay, but unfortunately the room you are currently in is already booked\"", "There could be other reasons like the person needing the room because of medical conditions like OPs husband, but can't depart as planned due to extenuating circumstances.\n\nCalling police on him is a bad idea for a lot of reasons. Whatever, someone in the hotel staff decided  and hoped that the new couple might be satisfied with a different room for the night.\nYou'd expect the hotel to immediately compensate them, but that's not how it oftentimes works, unless they are regulars", ">The people in the room also need that setup or they wouldn't have been in that room in the first place.\n\nReally? I only ask this out of naivety. (and out of not being disabled \"enough\" to require these rooms). I've always assumed it's like accessible bathrooms. They're there for those who need them, but available for anyone to use regardless, especially if all the other loos (aka rooms) are in use.", "Really? Not being funny, because I've had to move rooms in instances where I wanted to extend my stay but my particular room is already assigned moving forward. I get it, though, and I've never minded when the move was due to my last minute changes in plans. If the hotel effed up, then I get annoyed.\n\nNTA, op.", ">new reservations\n\nIt's a SIX MONTH OLD reservation dude.  It's not a new reservation in the least.", "No it is not\n\n\nDepebding on the place you are liable for the room to the dame or better standart and for a room like op describes this can be very expensive for the hotel.", "If this is in the US, the ADA takes priority every time and twice on Sunday.  The hotel\u2019s solution wasn\u2019t a reasonable accommodation considering the room was booked.  The other guest needed to be moved.", "No, in Marriott, Hilton, Radisson and some other hotels i stay at (platinum/gold member at these chains) I often do extensions when i\u2019m already there, if I have mood to stay a day or more. They always double-check in the system if there is no confirmed other reservation that would make the specific room unavailable. (I usually am in suites, with bathtub, balcony if possible etc which combination is limited)\n\nOp: NTA they should have denied the extension for that specific room, to honour your reservation. Also now that they could not accomodate these needs, they should have at least walked you to another nearby hotel on their cost where the requested ADA features are available.", "well thats just fucking dumb even if it is policy and you're dumb for sticking up for it bc \"that's just the way things are!\" yeah nothing's gonna get better w that attitude. ppl on this sub are so concerned w logic and precedent.", "Unfortunately, it doesn't matter when the reservation was made. The people that were already in the room extended their stay. As much as people hate it, you're not guaranteed the room you get regardless of how far ahead you make the reservation. I've been doing this for two decades, I know. None of us like dealing with this kind of situation because it sucks.", "Yes, it is. Of course the hotel should try to meet the standard or exceed it if possible but, regardless of that, the extension has priority.", ">The other guest needed to be moved\n\nAnd if the other guest was also an ADA guest and there was no other ADA room available?", "The people that were in the room prior to OP probably needed that room for a reason. Why does one person that need an ADA accessible room take priority over another person that needs a room that's ADA accessible?  They don't, the Ada part is a wash. In that case, the extension takes priority over the new reservation.", "Yes it is. I understand why from my guest perspective this seems ridiculous but as someone has been working in the industry for two decades, I can tell you that extensions take priority over new reservations. We just do absolutely everything we can to not get into this situation to start with. The hotel should have offered to walk them to another hotel that suits their needs.", "Again, as I told other people, I understand why people think that it's ridiculous but the people in that room also needed that type of room, having them move from that room to a different room, which wouldn't be accommodating them either, would piss them off.  No matter what, someone's going to be angry here but it means one less person that's having mobility issues has to move. OPs hotel should have offered to walk them to another hotel that can fit their needs."]}
