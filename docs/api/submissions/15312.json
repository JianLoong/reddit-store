I used to work in guest services. So let\u2019s say someone booked the ADA room and wanted to stay an extra night. Unfortunately, I would tell them they would need to switch rooms OR that we can\u2019t accommodate the additional night. Why? Because you don\u2019t know the situation of the person coming in but you have to assume they need the specific features.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s no way to know who made that call, and sometimes things like guest \u201cstatus\u201d (Like, VIP) might mean you have to be extra accommodating to them. It\u2019s a very political and weird place to be with a lot of judgment around which guest you think will be the most flexible. \n\nAlso, guess what - people would lose it on us ALL THE TIME! Generally speaking we would know all those things, that people are tired from traveling, that they aren\u2019t at their best, that someone made a judgement call that may not have been the best one. \n\nSo don\u2019t sweat it.

That said, the hotel chose to not build more ADA rooms than the bare minimum. They should have offered you the biggest room in the hotel, comped it, and asked for a list of equipment to rent for that night at hotel expense. Shoehorning you into a patently unsafe room is not acceptable, and charging anything whatsoever for it is galling. So of course you were frustrated.

I called them and told them that they WILL give me the ADA room as I had booked it first. \n\nThey also need to not book them to people who don't need them. I have a relative that always books and ADA room because they are bigger.

Did you make it directly through the hotel, like did you call the hotel itself and explain your situation OR did you book through a 3rd party like Expedia or Orbitz or something of that nature?  Why I ask this is often what you put into special requests through a 3rd party do not get transferred to the hotel. The DEFAULT king sized room for Expedia/ OTA rooms is an ADA but if a guest doesn't specify they actually NEED the ADA room, a FDA might think they are upgrading you to a better room, in order to keep this other in house guest happy and to make you happy that you got such a sweet deal on an even bigger room.  \n\n\nIt does sound like they compensated you for a night which is protocol for messing something up. However if the person in the ADA room ALSO NEEDED the room, moving them would also be bad form for the guest who was there before you. And moving you from room to room is also bad shit too. Like it's a giant pain in the ass for you and for housekeeping as well.  \n\n\nIf they called you full on aware that they had messed up, if you didn't make your reservations through expedia or something, they should have offered you a free cancellation and a list of other places that would be able to help you out.", "NTA, and completely justified in feeling angry and upset over the situation, but as others have said, sometimes it might be out of the hotel's control and it is almost certainly not the person on the phone to you who is personally responsible.

I recognize that the situation is definitely shitty and should have been handled differently, but you took it to a whole other level. Yes you need to be your husband\u2019s advocate; yes you had a need for that specific room that the current occupants did not; and yes you made a reservation specifically for *that room*. But the way you treated that poor worker was inexcusable. If I were that person, I would do the absolute bare minimum for you. I wouldn\u2019t deny you anything, obviously, but I would in no way go above and beyond to help you with any other requests. You should be ashamed of yourself for laying into someone just doing their best and trying to make a living at a shitty job. That poor worker was stuck between a rock and a hard place, and was going to be bitched at either way; but instead of considering that and ramping up the intensity if you weren\u2019t taken seriously, you immediately went nuclear. Is this how you handle everything in your life?\n\nFor the record, we would have handled it differently. We would have informed the current occupant that the specific room was required for another guest that pre booked and offer to let them stay in another room, should the hotel allow.
