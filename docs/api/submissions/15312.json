I used to work in guest services. So let\u2019s say someone booked the ADA room and wanted to stay an extra night. Unfortunately, I would tell them they would need to switch rooms OR that we can\u2019t accommodate the additional night. Why? Because you don\u2019t know the situation of the person coming in but you have to assume they need the specific features.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s no way to know who made that call, and sometimes things like guest \u201cstatus\u201d (Like, VIP) might mean you have to be extra accommodating to them. It\u2019s a very political and weird place to be with a lot of judgment around which guest you think will be the most flexible. \n\nAlso, guess what - people would lose it on us ALL THE TIME! Generally speaking we would know all those things, that people are tired from traveling, that they aren\u2019t at their best, that someone made a judgement call that may not have been the best one. \n\nSo don\u2019t sweat it. Nobody is crying at night because you yelled at them. Hopefully they got you all sorted out and it ends up working out for you and hubby.", "NTA, it shouldn't be harder for your husband to enjoy life too.

They should have blocked the room, make the keys, and seal that room away for the guest. There are always more than one ADA room and guests should ONLY be placed in ADA rooms upon request or unless the hotel is about to sell out. For exactly this reason.

The ultimate assholes here are the politicians, for pitting disabled people against each other in a competition for artificially scarce resources. Every public accommodation should have been required to be accessible, period, so that disabled people can travel as freely as any other person. As it stands, if the other guest genuinely needs an ADA room too, it's an impossible situation all around, because the politicians were chickenshits. That said, the hotel chose to not build more ADA rooms than the bare minimum. They should have offered you the biggest room in the hotel, comped it, and asked for a list of equipment to rent for that night at hotel expense. Shoehorning you into a patently unsafe room is not acceptable, and charging anything whatsoever for it is galling. So of course you were frustrated.

Yes, you can stay another night, but due to a prior reservation we will need to move you to another room. And if they argue, they get security called on them, I've already seen it happen.
