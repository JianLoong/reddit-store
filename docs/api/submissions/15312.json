The guest that had been here for 2 days just wanted to stay another day. WTF? I was really pissed. I told her very loudly what I thought of this awful situation. So we are staying the night in the wrong room and moving tomorrow to the right room. Also, a pain because we have to move all our gear between rooms at some point. The lady I lost my shit on spoke with her manager and they are knocking $60 off our bill tonight and comping our room free tomorrow.

I used to work in guest services. So let\u2019s say someone booked the ADA room and wanted to stay an extra night. Unfortunately, I would tell them they would need to switch rooms OR that we can\u2019t accommodate the additional night. Why? Because you don\u2019t know the situation of the person coming in but you have to assume they need the specific features.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s no way to know who made that call, and sometimes things like guest \u201cstatus\u201d (Like, VIP) might mean you have to be extra accommodating to them. It\u2019s a very political and weird place to be with a lot of judgment around which guest you think will be the most flexible. \n\nAlso, guess what - people would lose it on us ALL THE TIME! Generally speaking we would know all those things, that people are tired from traveling, that they aren\u2019t at their best, that someone made a judgement call that may not have been the best one. \n\nSo don\u2019t sweat it. Nobody is crying at night because you yelled at them. Hopefully they got you all sorted out and it ends up working out for you and hubby.", "NTA, it shouldn't be harder for your husband to enjoy life too. But they wouldn't have done anything for you if you hadn't've yelled. You may feel bad, but that just means you aren't entirely crazy, you care. I'm proud of you.", "NTA. That sucks for you, but keep in mind, in most places, it's _very_ hard to get someone out of a hotel room they don't want to leave. You're right to be pissed and tell them exactly how this is affecting you. But it's possible their only option was calling a sheriff to drag someone out at gunpoint.", "NTA, your room should be free and this is BS. You had a confirmed booking. Call Corporate and tag on Insta/Twitter. This is unacceptable.", "NTA for raising the issue. They created a huge issue for you. They messed up and they know it. Potentially stuck in a rock and a hard place if the person who took the room for the extra night was a owner or someone highly influential but the room was already booked. Their hands were tied. \n\nYou maybe the AH for yelling but we don't know if the person on the phone was responsible for the mistake or just the messenger. This also occurred an hour before check in so no wonder you were rightly annoyed.", "NTA. That compensation seems fair for the hassle you are going through. They should have moved the other person.", "NTA. My husband had ALS and couldn\u2019t walk for 6 years. This happened to us twice and it was miserable to adjust for just one night. A wheelchair can\u2019t maneuver properly in regular room, getting to the toilet is impossible, there is no taking a shower which is awesome after a day of traveling, and we only traveled with one bed rail so the risk of falling off the other side was increased. Anyone telling you to get over it is wrong. Disabled travelers deserve to be as safe in their rooms as anyone else", "NTA. They did the wrong thing, you telling them they are wrong is good.", "YTA only in regards that you yelled at a front desk clerk who more than likely didn't even have a hand in the situation. If you had spoken with the manager and not yelled it prob would have been better.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You don\u2019t know the circumstances as to why the other guest stayed the extra night. Could be medical, could be needing safe refuge, could be they were a regular patron who uses that room periodically. The hotel failed y\u2019all by picking winners and losers without disclosing their actual rationale, and while anyone would understand your annoyance, the front desk staff are HIGHLY UNLIKELY to be responsible for green lighting that decision. You just tore a strip off people who made the mistake of showing up for their shift.", "For going nuclear on the desk clerk, who likely had no hand in altering your room assignment, YTA.\n\nIn regards to being understandably pissed about getting screwed out of the room with the needed ADA accommodations, NTA.  Next time, try to avoid unleashing your fury on those that didn\u2019t have a direct hand in making your life more difficult.", "YTA. Not for the cause--you were totally in the right and deserved that room.\n\nHowever, you admit that you lost your shit on the desk clerk, a person who has literally no power in this moment. It wasn't her fault, and she couldn't fix the problem. All you accomplished in being nasty to her was making her day suck.", "YTA- there\u2019s never a reason to ever yell at staff.", "This is why I don\u2019t work in customer service", "NTA. They could have moved the other guest since he/she extended their stay.", "NTA.\n\nyou have every right to be annoyed at this as you paid for that room, they owed you the compensation for the room as the mistake was by them and not you. iv worked in the hotel industry and most of the time you will only be comped if you mention your are unhappy with the change of room.", "NTA I did night audit for three years and some nights it's your turn to eat the shit. It was good they comped you, I would've done the same. If you're a rewards member reach put to the GM, they can give you points in addition to the other compensation if you feel it's neccessary", "You\u2019re right and I hadn\u2019t thought of it that way.
