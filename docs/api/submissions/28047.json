She went on social media and wrote lies about you to her friends and your mother lost employment. Not to mention is also caused you to have your property vandalized. She's the adult who decided to put her irresponsible boyfriend first instead of her family, so you're entitled to put your wedding first before her invitation.", "NTA  Actions have consequences as your sister has now found out.", "your sister needs to start taking accountability and making amends and that starts with apologizing to your mother and writing an open letter on social media that she was wrong and what it cost.", "NTA. Your sister should publicly come clean about the slander and lies and apologize to all of you before reconciliation is even considered. Absolutely she has no right to be at your wedding.", ">She said she was wrong, that she was blinded by love. She told me that her boyfriend had left her, stole her property, and put her in debt (late on rent).\n\nNice sob story, but did she do anything to fix what she did? Doesn't sound like it. It sounds like she's using her poor circumstances to imply she's \"suffered enough\", but all parties suffered and it was entirely due to her poor choices. She needs to actually own her mistakes rather than cry about how unfair everything is.\n\nNTA for not inviting her.", "Why would she approach you about your wedding when she had cut your family off and turned a community against you for being racist?", "NTA\n\nMake stupid choices, get stupid results. \n\nShe has a lot of damage to repair. Too close to the wedding to do it. She's making excuses because she doesn't want to take responsibility. \n\nFirst, she has to correct all the social media issues she caused. Especially a solid attempt to correct your mom's job. She needs therapy.\n\nHer damage, her price. You make the right choice.", "NTA. \n\nShe is an adult who made harmful choices that ruined her life and caused damage to her family.\n\nYou are not obligated to forgive her or invite her. Do whatever brings you peace and happiness. \n\nI don't want to overstep but therapy may help process the harm and disruption that she has caused in your life. \n\nCongratulations on your wedding! I hope things get better for you, your spouse, and your parents", "NTA\n\nShe treated you all horribly and stirred on-line and real-life drama to the point you had vehicles vandalised and your mother lost her job. I don't see how you can come back from that.\n\nYour sister has made her bed, now she needs to lie in it.", "NTA.\n\nShe did this. Her accusations led to some serious harassment and even caused your mother to lose her job. Pretty bold of her to assume she'd still be welcomed at the wedding given everything she did. You can't just cause all this chaos and still expect to be invited to important life events. Actions have consequences, and sometimes, those consequences are burned bridges. Let that be a life lesson for your sister.", "NTA.  It sounds like your sister did a lot of damage to your reputation, not to mention her own parents.  It was very vindictive, and she is lucky that you still speak to her, in my opinion.  Protect your wedding by only having people there who have shown love and support for you.", "NTA.

She forgave her but their relationship is strained to this day. My dad is probably the one who is close to her.\n\nWhen I told my parents about my sister wanted an invite to the wedding, I told them they already paid for the amount of guests that we initially invited, and I didn\u2019t want to go through the process of adding another guest. My mom said it was up to me if I did wanted her there but my dad mentioned she should come at least to the family portraits. \n\nLike I still love her, she\u2019s my younger sister and all but I don\u2019t think I could ever forget everything she did. I can\u2019t even have a proper conversation with her and not think of what happened between us."]}
