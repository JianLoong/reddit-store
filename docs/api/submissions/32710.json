It\u2019s 9pm and suddenly my husband gets up and opens the front door and his friend walks in. I asked why there was a person in the house, and he said his friend had to pee. This wouldn\u2019t be an issue if it weren\u2019t for the fact that my boob was out from nursing our sick son to sleep, and we have FOUR DOGS. They, of course, bark and wake the baby up. I gave my husband a look that would\u2019ve knocked him dead if looks could kill, and when his friend left I said \u201cI think it goes without saying, never do that again\u201d as I\u2019m rocking our, now awake, baby. \nMy husband goes \u201cif someone needs to use the restroom I\u2019m going to let them\u201d \nI responded \u201che literally had to drive farther to get here than he would\u2019ve to stop at a gas station\u201d (based on where we live, no matter where his friend is coming from, this is true) \nHe said \u201cit\u2019s not my fault that the dogs barked\u201d\nI said \u201cbut it is your fault there was someone in the house to bark at or at a minimum, that they weren\u2019t outside when that person got here\u201d\nHe just responded with \u201csounds like a personal problem\u201d and went back to his game. \n\nI was annoyed about my sick baby being woken up, but now I\u2019m sitting here fuming that I couldn\u2019t get even an \u201cyeah I\u2019m sorry, that was a bad idea\u201d but maybe I\u2019m the a-hole for being annoyed it happened in the first place. What do yall think, AITA?\n\nUpdated: this got more attention than I expected \ud83d\ude05 a few things! \nI spoke to my husband again, who clarified the friend was already coming over to pick something up. He asked to use the restroom once here and it put my husband on the spot. Due to this I did apologize for the misunderstanding on my part, thinking my husband gave him permission to come inside in advance without giving me a heads up. I told him I still wish he would\u2019ve put the dogs outside, but I can see how the question took him off guard and he just did the nice thing and said yes without thinking what would happen next all the way through. \nI also told him that all would\u2019ve been only slightly annoying, had it not been for his remark afterwards. He has sort of apologized for that but I think at this moment I think he still feels wrong by my reaction overall and just isn\u2019t quite there yet. He did acknowledge it was disrespectful and that he would be mad if roles were reversed. \nAnd finally, he is not dealing drugs or doing any, good grief, I\u2019m not divorcing him over this and I sure as SHIT am not getting rid of my dogs. They don\u2019t bark at any little thing, just people coming inside, and do generally stop on command.

You can pee outside. I get it, he is a guy so we can dismiss his need to use the washroom and just assume he will go outdoors..but to me, using the restroom is a basic human right, not a privilege.
