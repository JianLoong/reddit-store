Nothing like that has ever happened before, I know the friend and he\u2019s a good dude. If it became a pattern or there were other red flags in our lives I think I would be inclined to do so, but as it stands it was just a weird one off", "I was in our living room on the couch, which is in direct eye line of the door, though at a bit of a distance. My son was in front of the exposed boob though so that\u2019s good at least, but I\u2019m often hanging out fully exposed these days and I don\u2019t even think he looked over before getting up\ud83e\udee3\ud83e\udd23", "When there\u2019s a sick baby, and a breastfeeding mother, their comfort should be his priority, but his mate needing to take a slash. \n\nBeing upset in that moment is completely reasonable. Snapping was reasonable. Having a mate waltz into the place was not at all reasonable.", "Sure, but you also should be self aware enough (and aware of others enough) not to do something like, in my opinion. And have the decency to acknowledge the thoughtless thing you did was thoughtless", "We have a mutual expectation that we run visitors by the other party in advance", "Been together nearly 15 years. Been a lot of work though to get to where we are today with communication\u2026 but worth it.", "We do have the mutual expectation that we don\u2019t have people over without the other person who lives in the home being made aware and also a mutual set expectation not to wake the baby up after his bedtime or times of distress, so yes lol.", "He did text him beforehand which was part of my frustration at my husband. Like sir you had time to prepare and give me a heads up or at least put the dogs out and you just\u2026. Didn\u2019t???", "That\u2019s how I feel.

I read it fine. I\u2019m asking you to elaborate babe.", "For real. I'm a woman and I pee outside, much easier for a dude to do. Really weird that the friend dropped by just to pee. I'm gonna guess he was either hoping to hang out or maybe delivering a bit of weed.", "I don't understand this OP for this reason. Is there some sort of peeing anxiety? \n\nWhat bloke is knocking on a mates door to pee at that time?? Or is it a woman?\n\nEven if it is a woman, I know plenty who would just do the same. \n\nThe whole sick baby etc seems irrelevant to me. I don't get it. \n\nFrom OPs other comments it sounds like they drove past many an appropriate quiet spot to deal with it. \n\nNTA.

OP has clarified this in other comments.", "assuming the baby didn't actually need feeding,  I would have given him the baby and made it HIS personal problem.\n\nIf he made the problem why should you need to be the one to fix it?", "Maybe just a bad moment for him.

Well I can see why she left", "My comment doesn\u2019t mention that at all.\n\n\nI\u2019m just replying to your manipulative actions with the internet", "Ahh ok, yea in that case dumb move.", "Some people can't acknowledge the thoughtless thing they did, in the moment. They need a moment to process all the things they're feeling and thinking.\n\nHe was thoughtless, by not thinking ahead to how to do this more quietly. You were venomous.\n\nYour husband was thinking about his friend, not about the baby. I presume he's smart enough to also know that your house is not the most convenient option, so why did his friend ask to come? Your husband should have told you and you both worked towards this unexpected guest feeling welcome in your house, for any personal emergency they might have. He wasn't wrong to allow his friend to come in. That's what we do for friends especially those willing to go out of their way in order to see one of us.\n\nYou snapped at him, when he was probably still worrying about his friend. His response was uncalled for, but so was yours.", "ah my bad if that was a reading comprehension failure, but imho that like makes it worse? I hope your husband is able to reflect and realize that his buddy's convenience isn't worth the stress this put you and your baby through.", "It sounds like your husband expects you to do everything. Glad you've got your dogs!", "I\u2019m not sure where you live/what time it is, but is the gas station even open?", "so sad :(", "upset, are we? i guess thats what happens when trolls get called out", ">or maybe delivering a bit of weed\n\nbased on absolutely fucking nothing, you pulled this out of your prison pocket", "Exactly this. You think waking my sick, grumpy baby is a \"personal problem\". Welp, you can now consider it YOUR \"personal problem\".", "My comment has to do with the post, and previous commenters comment.\nIf my husband were to have people over when my kids were sleeping and/or talk to me with disrespect while I care for OUR sick kids and be playing video games \u2026 ya no. We won\u2019t have internet here.", "Also in regards to your comment that it\u2019s not that big of a deal but seems like it is right now because he\u2019s sick- I concede that that\u2019s probably true. He was exposed to RSV this week and got sick shortly after, so I have been incredibly anxious and stressed. Everything regarding my son the last few days has felt like a level 10 emergency, even if it really isn\u2019t.", "His friend had to pee, you make it sound like he was gravely injured", "Yes. There are also a plethora of backroads on farmland on one side of us and several fast food places still open on the other side. Also would\u2019ve been fine with a heads up and him putting the dogs outside", "Hahahaha oh my god I love Reddit.", "What's a prison pocket?", "Cool cool\n\nThe fun thing about Reddit is you can reply to multiple people, not just OP", "I hope he gets better soon! \ud83e\udd1e", "I hadn't considered injury a possibility. I do know though that when my friends drop by unexpectedly, whether they say they need my bathroom or not, that there's a higher chance that something is going on for them and they're working up to talking about it with someone. And I'm *not* in an inconvenient location.\n\nYou seem determined to imagine that your husband was plain and simply thoughtless while I'm pointing out that he was thinking of his friend.\n\nI understand that you want him to prioritise the baby first, especially while sick, but this isn't how you get your needs and wants met. You're going to need to talk to each other.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019d be throwing out the game.", "Why didn\u2019t you just say that when you first confronted him about what happened? All you said was: \u201cdon\u2019t do that again\u201d. You didn\u2019t tell him which action you were referring to. You guys aren\u2019t arguing about the same thing. He thinks you\u2019re mad because he allowed his friend to come in and use the bathroom. You\u2019re upset because he didn\u2019t give you a heads up so you can prepare for a guest to enter the house. I think your anger interfered with your ability to communicate effectively. Just to be clear, this isn\u2019t a defense of your husband. I\u2019m just pointing out that it\u2019s possible he misunderstood your stance on this issue.", "me too!", "another way of saying ass, yknow, smuggling stuff into prison by sticking it up there. point is, where the hell did you get that this dude bought weed from the uninvited guest lol.", "lmao, this comment had me cracking up", "He walked in, used the restroom, and left. It was in no way deeper than that. There was nothing going on with his friend to be worried about", "No, he absolutely knows I\u2019m upset because our sick, sleeping baby was woken up. I didn\u2019t react until that happened and the next part of that conversation was \u201cour sick child being woken up is 100% your problem as well\u201d", "Honestly he probably doesn\u2019t realize. Like for real. You would think that he does but guarantee he doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s easy to think that people see things as we do but often we are way off", "You\u2019re misunderstanding my point. He thinks you\u2019re saying that he shouldn\u2019t have let his friend come in at all. What you\u2019re saying is he should have given you a heads up so you could ask him to put the dogs outside. You\u2019re arguing over two different aspects of the same situation."]}
