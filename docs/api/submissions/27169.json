Not for asking him/talking to him but when you did it. Read the room. He was in a shit mood after a long day. He comes home and is explaining that to him and you decide to pile on.

It was a long day, he's just had an awful experience, he was mentally drained.

I don't think anyone is wrong here unless this becomes a pattern.", "Thing is, he did tell you he had to do that. So, it wasn't unexpected so much as you forgot? My husband always wants to know when I'll be back at home and to the best of my ability I gauge that for him. I update him when I'm finding myself pressed too. So, its not wrong to ask. You aren't being controlling. Just don't ask him for something he's giving you - like letting you know he has to do something for his mom.\n\nNAH.", "ESH, once you knew he was busy leave him alone.  When you are living with someone and are going to be late (the place closes at 8:00) be polite and send a text when you will be home.", "NTA. Basic courtesy, he should have let you know what\u2019s going on. They closed at 8? I\u2019d be worried and concerned too.", "NAH - your timing was terrible and his response was as too much but understandable given the day and timing.  Have more grace and pick a better time to discuss a concern like that and only after a pattern of behavior.", "ESH, your boyfriend has the right to go wherever he wants especially since it's to help his mom, having a car would probably change her day to day life as she will be able to move easely\n\nBut he is also not in the right to just get angry when you ask him for something simple like to tell him when he gets off, forgetting to say it is very excusable, not everybody remembers, but getting angry about it when you tell him isn't good.\n\nSit down with him and communicate calmly, it's not that huge a problem", "NTA. Am I the only one thinking it is fishy that the place closed at 8 and he didn\u2019t get home until 10:30?  And then you add to it his overreaction to simply being asked to call if he will be late? Hmmm", "YES\n\nmind your own business, you probably added a TON of stress to his night, and then **again** bringing up when he got home", "At your big age you\u2019re still having this talk?? \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "His being \"infuriated\" at being asked to let you know next time makes me think he was not telling the truth about why he was out so late.", "Nta. Unless he walked in at 8, i dont see them taking until after 10 to wrap up a sale. A lot of places cant/wont do after hrs, cant approve or verify things. I am assuming you work 2nd shift. Not that he was gone all day & all evening. But his reaction is so suspect. Wouldnt trust him", "I think asking was fair.  He's an adult. You're an adult, and on a personal note, I know what it's like to worry about someone.  It's an emotional free fall into very dark places where only the worst-case scenarios happen. Thankfully, that wasn't the case. Doesn't mean that your feelings are not valid.  That being said, we're only human, and sometimes reading the room goes out the window, just like his phone call telling you not to worry that all was well.  It's the little things that, if not addressed, add up to things that can't be ultimately overcome. Then again, maybe  going to bed angry or hurt won't cause any major issues this time...", "I thought he was angry at being questioned like he didn't tell her in the first place? I could be missing something, though?", "When women are used to living alone, knowing when someone is going to be coming into the house is a safety thing. Having someone move in changes that dynamic. That part IS her business. Should she have waited to ask? Maybe. But when you share a home, that\u2019s shared business.", "I read this much the same. \n\nOP is clearly overworking themselves. They finally get off a bit early and have forgotten that their SO has already informed them that they have prior obligations. \n\nOP stews in their own frustration for hours (likely- timeline is missing) and then gets upset about a late arrival home and a lack of response so decides to add to their SO\u2019s growing list of the days frustrations. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to be able to gauge when the nuances of a car contract are going to be hammered out. But clearly there was a perceived lack of communication. Typing a quick message isn\u2019t difficult but I don\u2019t know any of the pertinent details of what was happening. I suspect neither does OP. \n\nClearly it was a frustrating experience for both parties but imo OP is YTA for their lack of empathy. Neither party wanted the SO at a car dealership until 10 at night. We could all use a little less self-preoccupation."]}
