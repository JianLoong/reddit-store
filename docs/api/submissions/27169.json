I don't think anyone is wrong here unless this becomes a pattern.", "Thing is, he did tell you he had to do that. So, it wasn't unexpected so much as you forgot? My husband always wants to know when I'll be back at home and to the best of my ability I gauge that for him. I update him when I'm finding myself pressed too. So, its not wrong to ask. You aren't being controlling. Just don't ask him for something he's giving you - like letting you know he has to do something for his mom.\n\nNAH.", "ESH, once you knew he was busy leave him alone.  When you are living with someone and are going to be late (the place closes at 8:00) be polite and send a text when you will be home.", "NTA. Basic courtesy, he should have let you know what\u2019s going on. They closed at 8? I\u2019d be worried and concerned too.", "NAH - your timing was terrible and his response was as too much but understandable given the day and timing.  Have more grace and pick a better time to discuss a concern like that and only after a pattern of behavior.", "ESH, your boyfriend has the right to go wherever he wants especially since it's to help his mom, having a car would probably change her day to day life as she will be able to move easely\n\nBut he is also not in the right to just get angry when you ask him for something simple like to tell him when he gets off, forgetting to say it is very excusable, not everybody remembers, but getting angry about it when you tell him isn't good.\n\nSit down with him and communicate calmly, it's not that huge a problem", "NTA. Am I the only one thinking it is fishy that the place closed at 8 and he didn\u2019t get home until 10:30?  And then you add to it his overreaction to simply being asked to call if he will be late? Hmmm", "YES\n\nmind your own business, you probably added a TON of stress to his night, and then **again** bringing up when he got home", "At your big age you\u2019re still having this talk?? \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "His being \"infuriated\" at being asked to let you know next time makes me think he was not telling the truth about why he was out so late.", "Nta. Unless he walked in at 8, i dont see them taking until after 10 to wrap up a sale. A lot of places cant/wont do after hrs, cant approve or verify things. I am assuming you work 2nd shift. Not that he was gone all day & all evening. But his reaction is so suspect. Wouldnt trust him", "I think asking was fair.  He's an adult. You're an adult, and on a personal note, I know what it's like to worry about someone.  It's an emotional free fall into very dark places where only the worst-case scenarios happen. Thankfully, that wasn't the case. Doesn't mean that your feelings are not valid.  That being said, we're only human, and sometimes reading the room goes out the window, just like his phone call telling you not to worry that all was well.  It's the little things that, if not addressed, add up to things that can't be ultimately overcome. Then again, maybe  going to bed angry or hurt won't cause any major issues this time...", "I thought he was angry at being questioned like he didn't tell her in the first place? I could be missing something, though?", "When women are used to living alone, knowing when someone is going to be coming into the house is a safety thing. Having someone move in changes that dynamic. That part IS her business. Should she have waited to ask? Maybe. But when you share a home, that\u2019s shared business.", "I read this much the same. \n\nOP is clearly overworking themselves. They finally get off a bit early and have forgotten that their SO has already informed them that they have prior obligations. \n\nOP stews in their own frustration for hours (likely- timeline is missing) and then gets upset about a late arrival home and a lack of response so decides to add to their SO\u2019s growing list of the days frustrations. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to be able to gauge when the nuances of a car contract are going to be hammered out. But clearly there was a perceived lack of communication. Typing a quick message isn\u2019t difficult but I don\u2019t know any of the pertinent details of what was happening. I suspect neither does OP. \n\nClearly it was a frustrating experience for both parties but imo OP is YTA for their lack of empathy. Neither party wanted the SO at a car dealership until 10 at night. We could all use a little less self-preoccupation.", "You were home at an unexpected time since you got off early. You didn\u2019t communicate that and _you\u2019d forgotten_ about his commitment with his mom. \n\nYou are expecting him to communicate when he\u2019s away from home  - whether you\u2019re there or not.  YTA.", "Suggestion: put a calendar on the fridge and you both write in it when something is planned.", "YTA. Could be a E S H, but without a concrete description like he yelled at you or called you names, its hard to tell if your boyfriend was *actually* \"infuriated\" or that's just you projecting like saying he \"probably won't talk\" to you.\n\nBuying a car takes a while and can be a frustrating and drawn out experience even if you're prepped ahead of time. I was in contact with my dealer over the summer, ordered my new vehicle in October and did some preliminary financials to work out monthly payments and the down, and when it arrived in December, I showed up with check in hand, prepped as much ahead of time as I could, and *still* spent half a day negotiating, getting final financing approved, doing inspections and detailing, getting insurance set up (even with a previous quote!), signing contracts, and driving my old vehicle home to pick up a second driver so I could finally, 6+ hours later, drive my new one off the lot. I can't imagine how much longer it would have taken to factor in trade in value if we were doing that. And you said your boyfriend was there because his mom broke her old car, so this was probably not how he expected or wanted to spend his evening either. \n\nI don't blame him for being annoyed with you; he tells you about the awful time he just had and instead of offering sympathy your first thought is \"well you should have let me know the precise second you're going to be home\"? Nah girl, read the fucking room. You can talk about \"hey, I'd appreciate a quick text if plans go sideways\" later, when it *doesn't* sound like criticizing him for being stuck somewhere he didn't want to be in the first place.", "YTA? The question mark is because I'm confused. It sounds like he told you what was happening. When you reached out to him after that, did he respond to any of those messages? And do you know if he was doing most of the negotiations for her, because then he would have had a hard time keeping up a text conversation.", "YTA", "Why would moving in now mean he has to provide a current schedule to you at all times? He can\u2019t go out to *visit his mom*? \n\nYTA", "NTA - people who live together keep each other informed about the time they are going to get back home. Period. All other details are irrelevant.", "I totally agree that thinking the worst case senerios was a problem I had to face and that not everyone has that mechanism to have to cope with. Those were my demons to carry. \n\nNo two individuals are the same, yet in these relationships, we are expected to come together in a modicum of harmony . That can only be achieved by compromise and flexibility on both sides. \n\nDecompressing before they can have an adult conversation is a them issue. He probably needs to address that with a therapist if that is taking him to a place where he is having trouble communicating?\n\n Stress isn't fun for either party. Things that trigger her anxiety or concerns are no less valid than his. \n\nHerein lies the problem.  One party has to or rather is expected to shelve their feelings until a more appropriate time to avoid stressful situations, and all is does is breed discontent. Over a given time that can kill a relationship just as quickly as infidelity. \n\nUnfortunately, saying these things on a forum not in the actual moment is easy while applying this in the moment when the stresses of everyday life are taking place is much more difficult.", "NTA but maybe the time to make the point wasn't when he was frustrated and exhausted.", "yta", "I can understand why you would be frustrated. You work long hours and you obviously enjoy your bf\u2019s company. However, in fairness to your boyfriend, it sounds as though he went on his day as he normally would while you were working and it was your schedule that changed unexpectedly. Would the communication have mattered if you hadn\u2019t finished work early? \n\nAs some others have mentioned, your boyfriend also shared with you he\u2019d had a rough day and rather than acknowledging or supportively communicating back with your bf, you chose to criticise his communication..\n \nYTA unfortunately", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole. But he\u2019s allowed to not want that kind of relationship.", "YTA \n\nread the room", "I probably should have clarified this in this post, but I did communicate to him when I was getting off that morning. It was earlier than most my days -- I didn't get off earlier than scheduled.", "I think she is the AH, a guy got the AH for getting mad that his girlfriend went to a wedding, didn't text him for 11 hours and came home after 1am....so I'm pretty sure that makes her the AH for demanding he tell her anytime he won't be in the house.", "Why does he suck, I remember a recent post hear about a woman who went to a wedding without a boyfriend and didn't get home until 1am and he was annoyed she never texted him for like 11 hours, he got called the AH for being controlling but suddenly its reversed here??? Explain that?", "He did tell her, she forgot. YTA", "You are still the one who forgot. He communicated. You forgot. This is on you.", "That is a you issue. If your mind is going to such places in such situations that isn\u2019t healthy it wasn\u2019t like the guy got home at 8am the next day. It was a couple hours after she expected him home. Could he communicated better? Or sooner? Sure  but sometimes you don\u2019t know shit going to be stressful and drag on and when it does you\u2019re busy dealing with the moment,  trying to keep in check your own stress and anxiety most people won\u2019t have the bandwidth to deal with someone else\u2019s stress and anxiety aswell. Nothing wrong with wanting better communication but the time to talk about is not when they\u2019re still decompressing from the stressful anxious situation that they had to deal with.", "Life is not black and white you know, stop commenting every comment that is not of the same opinion as yours.\n\nAlso, there is a HUGE difference between the 2 stories \n\n1- guy in your story knew where she was, and it's expected not to be on your phone during a wedding, unless you want to pass a message that the event is boring\n\n2- op here, although forgot, knew the car dealer closes at 8. So from 8 to 10:30, there is no contact as to where her bf is, she doesn't know if he is still at the shop, at his mom's, suffered an accident... she is right to get worried. Welcome in adult life, when you communicate with your partner about your whereabouts.\n\nOp is an ah in this situation not because of her request, but because she could have waited the next day when he was calmer to present her demands", "Not really a HUGE difference, most women at weddings are on thier phones constantly at weddings, not even taking 2 secs during 11 hours to say you will be home late is a dick move....in the second, the op was out for a few ours extra, which she already surmised was because they were trying to hash out a deal, 10:30 isn't that late,he's a grown man..1am is a bit late given that most people leave weddings like half 10 or 11.\n\nI agree both need to communicate, however I would appreciate not being told what to comment on, I am free to comment, you are more than welcome to disagree which I fully support. I'm just pointing out glaring hypocrisy, this OP is getting mostly NTA, yet if the genders were reversed, he'd get YTA all day long for demanding his girlfriends notify him of her whereabouts whenever he is not home on his time off.", "Welcome on Reddit, of course there will be hypocrisy, what did you think ? Double standards apply here\n\nThen at a wedding, I'm taking pictures but not on messengers apps, and expect me to be home at 3am minimum. I don't even know the story you are talking about, but seems like you were the guy in the story", "No, it was another AITA story, the OP was the girl, she went to a wedding where he was not invited (fine, no issues) but then didn't message him at all during the 11 hours, no \"hey look at the wedding\"  \"hey its a good wedding, would be better if you were hear\" and I get it, she's allowed to have fun, but if they are a serious couple, wouldn't you want your SO there, if it never crossed her mind to even think of him for a text, does she really care?.\n\nI'm sure if any woman posted that story about a bf going to a wedding without her, not texting all day or night and rocking up at 1am would all back the woman for being pissed.\n\nAnyway,as you said, there is a double standard...was just pointing it out."]}
