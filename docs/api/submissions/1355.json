I go to school for 8 hours a day, Kelly does not work at all. That was really tiring for me as I wake up every day and went to school when Kelly just stays home and sleeps all day. At one point I just let the house get filthy because I was tired of cleaning when it was not my responsibility.\n\nI stayed with my mom that night. I told my mom what had been going on and we decided that I would stay with her for a while just to get a break from Kelly while I was there my dad randomly started texting me saying I need to be more respectful and that if I don\u2019t like the way things are done around his house that I can deal with it. I then told him that if he can\u2019t stand to be around my \u201cdisrespectful mouth\u201d that I would just stay with my mom. He then said that he would pack my stuff for me I told my mom and she was pissed The next day after school I went straight to my dads and noticed he had not packed anything I got my suitcase and started packing all of my clothes  and put it all in the back of my moms car and we left, but before I went I wrote a letter for my SM and Dad to see after I left. And let\u2019s just say the words I used were not very nice such as, b!tch, coc@!n addict, c*nt, etc. my dad got home later that night and was pissed that all of my stuff was gone. I explained to him that I had already told him I was leaving and  if he was that mad Kelly  could\u2019ve stopped me as I walked past her 3 times with all of my stuff including a huge suitcase. Kelly says that she never saw me leave. I eventually told my dad about my feelings on Kelly and he told me that I was  looking for attention and that she did nothing wrong. \n\nI\u2019m still living with my mom after about 2 months me and my dad have somewhat made amends but he knows I won\u2019t be around Kelly for anything. My whole family thinks I\u2019m the asshole for \u201clying\u201d and calling my step mom horrible names.", "created_utc": 1667601659, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymcpyr/aita_for_moving_out_of_my_dads_and_calling_my_sm/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There was no need to resort to name-calling.", "NTA It was rude, but ultimately you decided to move to a place where you can feel safe. That's smart, well done. Your dad was less than impressive in this situation.", "NTA. I feel like the adults In your life have failed you miserably", "I have more stories about her stealing from me and my dad let me know if y\u2019all think I shouldn\u2019t post them !", "I would say E\\_S\\_H if your father and stepmom weren't that much bigger AH than you, so I'll go with NTA.\n\nI still think that you were wrong to stoop to name-calling the way you did, but you were not wrong for removing yourself from that situation. Your father and stepmother, however, were very much in the wrong for creating the situation at your father's home in the first place. After all, it's most definitely not your job as a minor to run your father's household.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
