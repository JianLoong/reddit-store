We began renovations and I began to notice that my neighbors have 4 dogs. They would be outside all day even when it is raining and storming out. I could see over their fence from my deck and saw muddy paw prints all over their house. The one dog would stand at their back door and constantly bark. They will bark for seemingly no reason at any time. \n\nOnce we moved in their barking began to drive me crazy, I will admit that me screaming at their dogs wouldn\u2019taccomplish anything but when I can hear them in my house it drives me insane. Oh and I forgot to mention our houses are like 8 feet apart. My wife is in school and has to record videos of her talking but constantly has to start over because of the barking.\n\nI also believe that they neglect they dogs, they have a small house but a decent sized yard so they have room to run. The reason I believe they are neglected happened when I was watering my yard and I saw them trying to drink the water coming from the sprinkler that was hitting their fence. I have seen them drink from mud puddles in their yard before so I doubt they are given any water. \n\nThis incident just occurred while I was painting my garage door. I had my airpods in and I was listening to a story when the one dog started to bark. I stood on my stool and saw it walking around their deck barking at nothing, I told it to shut up (it didn\u2019t listen). After yelling at it to be quiet again I went back to painting. I was painting when I hear something not from my story. I turn to see the neighbor walking over and I pull out one of my airpods. He said \u201cdo you have a problem\u201d. I answer in the affirmative and say yes your dogs keep barking. He said \u201cits ok\u201d and I say not to me its not. He then gets in that classic I don\u2019t know how to fight but I think I can stance. He said \u201cwell do something about it then\u201d. I ask him what his problem is and he says \u201cyou are my problem\u201d. I told him I just can\u2019t stand your dogs barking and I can hear it when I am in my house. He again says \u201cits ok\u201d. I told him I understand that they are dogs and they will bark but it is excessive. At this point I am convinced he only knows about 3 sentences and he says again that \u201cits ok\u201d. I say no it\u2019s not as he begins to walk away and that they need to be more considerate to their neighbors. He turns around and again says \u201cwell then do something about it\u201d in an aggressive tone. All this while 3 of his kids were watching (father of the year right). He said to call someone and I say \u201cok\u201d. As he walks away he mumbles \u201cf*inf douche bag\u201d. \n\nI know that other neighbors have issues with their dogs as well, I have heard other neighbors telling them to shut up as well. I am not entirely sure what my approach should be to this, wether I should in fact call the cops for the noise disturbance/animal abuse/ or the threatening nature he showed towards me.
