I tried to calm her down and told her it wasn't a big deal. I told her I already had a \"talk\" with him about. She got upset that I didn't tell her about it and they she deserved to know. I told obviously he was embarrassed about it and that he just turned 14 its normal at his age for him ti start \" you know\" and it wasn't my place to tell her about the magizines incase he wasn't out to her.

They were not yours to let him keep. You didn't have to tell your ex where you got them, just that you found them in a bag/box somewhere. At no point would you have risked outing your son.\n\nLet's not gloss over the sanitary portion of it. I'd be grossed out if I found out someone was pleasuring themselves with my property. That's on top of the embarassment of finding out my child found them *and then used them*. Your ex would be totally entitled to both of those feelings. You could have just as easily allowed your son to buy his own magazines and explain why stealing is wrong and why intruding on someone's sexual privacy like he did was wrong. But instead you got to play the hero single parent at the expense of your ex who is just as much a parent as you. You're early in your divorced parent life and have already made it clear that you're not going to be a good coparent", "I think it's great to try to keep from outing yiur son, but unless his mom is a homophobe, it would have been good to suggest that he talk to her or that you two talk to her together. The kid is 14 and stole dirty magazines. Not a huge crime, but if she knew they were gone and asked you she was going to continue to wonder where they were. And as you found them hidden at your house, there was always a good chance she would find them at her house. Addressing the issue directly while also showing him support and telling the story about you stealing from your dad's stash would have been the best option. Now it seems like you are not a coparenting team, and that you'll keep info from her.", "NTA. Your wife's privacy with her old Playgirls and her feeling that you should have told her that her son took them is ENTIRELY trumped by your 14 year old son accidentally outing himself to you as gay. ENTIRELY became about not shaming him immediately as you realized, because of course he felt he had to sneak\u2014that's how it is for kids in his shoes, and of course you needed to make sure you did not shame him. You did right, and your wife is doing wrong. He is just finding out that he is a member of an oppressed group because of his sexual orientation\u2014 what the hell else should be laid on him? Nope, you did great.", "YTA. Dude, I understand you wanting to protect his privacy, but your son STOLE those magazines. That's a bit of a bigger problem here. He shouldn't have been touching his mother's things. You should have definitely taken the magazines from him and returned them discreetly. Your ex is right to be mad at you, you were enabling a major violation of her trust and stealing", "NAH\n\nYou are co-parenting so you should be making decisions as if you were both still in the same house. Your reaction was appropriate & her reaction was appropriate. I think you are both trying to do the best for your son. BUT ... Your son did take something that wasn\u2019t his so that also needs to be addressed. The entire story is a little confusing though... \n\nYou are getting divorced & have moved out but your ex is concerned about her playgirl magazines. So much concern that she noticed they were gone when you moved out? It was last published almost 10 years ago. Did she keep them displayed on a book shelf as collector items?\n\neta", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't want to out your son to his mom, rightfully. He should do it himself when he sees the time is fit. \n\nHowever, I personally would've taken the mags back and given back to the mom, and just told her I found them while unpacking some stuff.", "NTA. You're very sensible and the kid's mother is out to lunch.", "Slight YTA your heart was in the right place but you were off on the execution. There were two better options here. Either you should have confiscated the magazines and returned them to you ex with \u201cjust found these in a box\u201d and not outed your son or when your ex found out you should have asked to talk to your son first and get your stories straight so you don\u2019t hurt him or further enrage her. Revealing that you knew but didn\u2019t tell her is the issue that is going to cause all of you more problems here.", "ESH. You were right about giving a talk to your 14 year old son, but wrong about your reasoning. There's a reason parental controls exist and a reason good parenting techniques screen for inappropriate and obsene content on your child's devices, if they have devices at all.", "NTA, but remember despite you being divorced, you are both parents and need to communicate.", "NTA - Well done Dad. Your son will appreciate being able to trust you.", "NTA but you are in for a long 8 years of coparenting.", " NTA", "Big NTA, dirty magazines is a right of passage at that age no matter where you get them from, I don\u2019t get all the Y T A s for stealing from the mum, like if he\u2019s developing his own interests he\u2019s not gonna try and go out to buy them from a shop, and at least he\u2019s not using internet pornography given how nasty that can be, if he was able to get an entire stack from his mum, maybe she should\u2019ve hidden them better - I mean you know how teenage boys are at the age, the amount of people I know who stole their dad\u2019s motorcycle nudie mags just because they were easy to find", "NTA you are an awesome Dad", "NTA, and in years from now your son is going to be grateful for how you respected him.", "Ehhhh tiny tiny yta\n\nI'm gonna preface it off by saying you are a considerate parent and I admire your desire to make your son feel safe. You were in a very difficult situation where either way you were gonna upset someone, I might have done the same. \n\nBut\n\nI think as divorced parents this was something that your wife should have been informed about because although you are a family, you're not one household unit anymore, and it makes this a little more tricky cus he stole them from your wife, not you. This has more layers than just your dad covering for you for taking his nudie mags.\n\nI agree that he could see much worse online, but that's not really the issue here. A divorced parental relationship takes more honesty and cooperation than a married parental relationship, and trust is easier to break. \n\nI don't think you could have come out of this without looking like an asshole to someone either way so you did the best you could to protect your kid and the trust he has in you. \n\nBut I think you are not understanding your wife's feelings, because we are human and we are confusing emotionally driven creatures and as much as we are uncomfortable to admit it, gender and sexuality is a hard thing for most of us to process. You and your dad, are the are the same gender, where as this might have an extra level of awkwardness because her son found mom's porn of his gender. I would agree it's more embarrassing. Let's imagine you found out your wife didn't tell you that your daughter had stolen your playboys, I guarantee it would be far more uncomfortable for you than if your boys did it. \n\nThere are some situations where you have to tell your kids, I know this is uncomfortable but this is something we have to tell mom, does she know you're ________? She loves you and me finding out _______ wasn't that bad, trust that she's on your side too. We're a family and even though sometimes things might feel awkward for a bit, but it's a hell of a lot less uncomfortable than betraying each other's trust or living with a secret hanging over your head all the time\"", "NTA, I maybe would have snuck the magazines back to be 'found' again, or at least told your son to hide them better. But reassuring and protecting your son was absolutely the right thing to do, he wasn't in danger having a few playgirls (especially compared to what he can see online as you rightly identify). \n\nHis sexuality is nobody's business but his and that includes his mom, he will decide when he's ready to talk to her about it. You made sure he was safe, talked to him honestly and supported him as a parent, that's really all that matters. \n\nYour ex maybe feels she would have handled it differently, it's a recent split, hopefully you can use this as an opportunity to discuss co-parenting priorities and boundaries etc", "NTA", "NTA. If your son was ready to talk to his mom about something like that, then he would, and I'm sure you would encourage him to do so when he was ready to. It's not exactly an easy conversation for any party to have. Whether you swing one way or the other. I still feel slightly traumatized by my mom's sex talk when I was ten. (BTW, there was a lot of embarrassment and references to Days of Our Lives, the soap she watched. Her parents were super traditional and I'm sure she thought she was being open and informative about everything.)\n\nI think your wife is just hurt that you knew before she did and the two of you didn't have a plan in place. But it's in your son's best interest to have a parent who he can confide in and won't judge him.", "NTA. Your son talked with you in confidence, and you kept that confidence. It probably would have been better to ask him for permission to talk with her, rather than just outright assuming he would say no. But honestly that's a minor quibble, and you erred on the side of safety anyway.\n\nBut you should have confiscated the Playgirls.

By defintion.\n\nIf you don't have a problem with it, that's fine. Raise your kids however you want. But to suggest it isn't theft is objectively wrong. All children will typically steal *something* from their parents and it's usually a non-issue, but that doesn't mean you don't still talk to them about it. Everything that the son did is normal for his age, but normal does not mean acceptable", "Listen pal, \n\nProperty is property, and it has a financial value even if it doesn\u2019t have a subjective value to you", "Just from a cursory search, brand new they are like $10-15, but old copies that aren't in print can be very valuable. Playgirl isn't anywhere near as popular as Playboy is/was, so I imagine that makes them harder to find.\n\nThat being said, I believe the real value here lies more in the personal value they had to the mom, and the value of having her privacy/property respected. I know I would be mortified if anyone I knew, especially my child, found by accident something that isn't appropriate to share with them on purpose. Also, who knows what the mother did with them. She could be mortified that her child handled something that was made unsanitary. Magazines for personal use don't always stay clean", "Depends.  Had a relative that sold an entire collection back to day 1 of an extremely popular mag.  No idea, but as a collection, they can be quite valuable.  I used to keep them for quite a while as did SO, talking years.  Now that I think about it, so did my dad.", "Your dad is his own person, as is your ex. Your dad being ok with your theft doesn't mean your wife will be ok with your son's. Besides, if it was your dad who discovered your theft and he didn't do anything then that was *his choice* that made it ok. This is not an equal comparison between the two.\n\nI think you made a well intentioned error of judgement, but it's still an error of judgement at the expense of your ex. While not intentional, it's also an error against your son because if you had taken the magazines his mother would never have found them and he wouldn't have been outed before he was ready", "It is illegal to allow children access to porn. You could literally lose custody and face charges for not taking them away.", "Which is exactly why I am saying that the father should have returned them discreetly, as it's obviously a sensitive situation if he is not out to his mom yet. But he shouldn't have gotten to keep the magazines, that's what she is rightfully mad about.", "Lots of children do lots of things they shouldn't be doing that doesn't mean they should just be allowed to do them.", "I see... well at this point you\u2019re going to need to tell your son his mom already knows because she found them in his room. So you may want to make a plan with ex for that conversation. And he did still take something that wasn\u2019t his... so they should be returned. \n\nHe\u2019s 14 ... sex needs to be discussed by both parents in practical ways like understanding of consent, bodily autonomy, safety, and other social and emotional skills that kids need guidance for. Both parents should be available to answer any & all questions. Keeping Mom out of the loop is not a good healthy choice for your son. Unless she is wildly inappropriate she should be a trusted adult for your son to turn to.

To ensure your kids win & you have the opportunity to do the absolute best for them, communication has to be open & inclusive. I could talk about sex with my sons just as well I my husband could.
