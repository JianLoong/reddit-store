Anyway, I'm hearing that being with you isn't enough fun for her and neither is having a dinner that includes you and some friends.

The day was well done on your part.", "So she wanted you to give her the reservation, presumably to use it without you being there too?

It sounds like you have some pretty fundamental communication/understanding issues. \n\nYou told her that you wanted to spend the night with her, so she definitely shouldn\u2019t have blown you off.

You knew she wanted to try that specific restaurant and it was hard to get into. Yes you wanted it to be a surprise, but when she told you she didn't wanna sit in a restaurant and wanted to go out with friends, knowing that you has reservations for that specific place could have made the situation different. I think at that moment you should've foregone the surprise and asked if she was sure she didn't want to make good on that reservation, and if she said no then let her know you're gonna take your sister while she's out with friends.\n\nI can see why she might feel a bit hurt if this place was somewhere she was excited to go to. Going out to a restaurant and going out to *this restaurant* might be different cases for her.", "NTA, and fucking *yikes* at the  Y T As in here.", "Gentle YTAH, because you seem to be flaunting that you went to the restaurant without her. When she asked to rearrange the birthday plans you should have confessed your reservation to that particular restaurant for dinner. Once she understood your intentions then she could decide if she really wanted to go to that restaurant with you or spend the time with her friends. \n\nSounds like she had no faith you\u2019d do something nice for her so she made other plans. Your statement about not buying a gift due to financial security is ridiculous. I\u2019d wager you don\u2019t usually do nice things for her/gifts/taking her out where she likes/acknowledge her birthday and she made a contingency plan to offset your usual thoughtlessness.

Starting at the  \u201cAesthetic Picnic\u201d wtf Is that.  She\u2019s obviously more concerned with aesthetics than spending time w/ you.

She knew months in advance you wanted to spend the night with her, and she could have hung out with her friends during the day or another evening.

I\u2019m sorry but the reservation of two needs to be cut in half because she said she didn\u2019t want to spend her birthday with you just her friends.

You gave her exactly what she said she wanted (day with you, night with her friends.) You planned fun activities, including going all out for an aesthetic picnic (that's bonus points in my book). \n\nInstead of being grateful for what you did, she's mad because you did something cool without her. Also, for the record, giving an experience such as an aesthetic picnic IS a gift. I would argue it has far more value than a physical thing, as time is the only resource that that can never be given back.\n\nShe's telling you who she is, OP. Please re-read what you wrote and listen to her.", "NTA\n\nSoo\u2026 she\u2019s guilt tripping and gaslighting you because you had a good time with your sister.\n\nThat\u2019s soo weird to see, what the hell", "There seems to be a disconnect. You two should communicate. You say you don\u2019t buy gifts because you\u2019re both financially secure, and she can buy her own things. For many that\u2019s not what giftgiving is about. \n\nI question whether it was entitlement that made her ask about the reservation or if there\u2019s something deeper she\u2019s looking for some type of grand gesture. She did mention that she knew you weren\u2019t gonna give her a real gift.   I wonder if gift giving is part of her \u201clove language\u201d and yours is actions.", "NTA.

Once she turned down the gift it was no longer a gift and thus not her business", "In defense of \"aesthetic\" things, it is absolutely okay, and even wonderful sometimes to enjoy things for beauty's sake. If that is not something artistic you personally appreciate, that's okay. But someone is not unworthy simply because that is what they enjoy.", "He gifted her experiences. He went carting with her and to this picknick he prepared everything for and would have taken her out to dinner at a fancy restaurant if she didn't think hanging out with her friends would be more fun. In my book that is showing that he's thinking about her and trying to make her smile. A lot of people I know actually prefer experiences over material things for a gift.", "Man, it doesn\u2019t even sound like she likes you\u2026 to say she wants the restaurant reservation to go with *her friends* at a later date and not you???", "Let's say you'll live through similar situations over and over again in your relationship, with similar outcomes to the current one. What would you do?", "A simple \u201cbut we\u2019re going to the restaurant you\u2019re really excited about\u201d would have went a long way.", "It would have been interesting to give her the reservation, for 2 I assume, and then the gf shows up with a bunch of her friends. I wonder what the restaurant would do?", "The exit is clearly marked. \"Sitting in a restaurant with you would be boring but with my friends would be fun\" is DEFINITELY a door with a green running person signposted above it.", "That\u2019s okay. I found your explanation helpful even if it was r/whoosh. Not only does this woman not want to spend time with her boyfriend, when she does spend time with him, it\u2019s for influencer pics.
