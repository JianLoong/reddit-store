Now she thinks you should have given her the reservation so she could go to a restaurant with her friends?  (Were you supposed to pay for this dinner too or just give her the reservation?)   Anyway, I'm hearing that being with you isn't enough fun for her and neither is having a dinner that includes you and some friends.  But she's happy to use you to get a reservation she didn't think to get herself.   \n\nNot getting \"long term relationship\" vibes here.", "NTA. \n\nShe\u2019s upset because you got to experience something without her when she was out AND that she didn\u2019t get to have the chance to experience it *without you* by having you give *her* the reservation. \n\nYou everything she asked for her birthday (daytime hang, picnic), plus you sound like a great brother for taking your sis to dinner instead of staying home alone while your girlfriend went out.\n\nYour girlfriend has main character syndrome.", "NTA, she wanted you to go together but I\u2019m the same breath give her the reservation so she could have taken her friends and not you, she\u2019s deff TA", "Your girlfriend is a spoiled brat.  She made her choice to hang with friends without you because it sounded like the better deal.    Then when she finds out you actually had the better plans she wanted it for her and her friends without you.    You need a better girlfriend and you should always get something for a girlfriend on her birthday.  The day was well done on your part.", "So she wanted you to give her the reservation, presumably to use it without you being there too? NTA, your girlfriend didn't want to spend the evening with you & is just annoyed that you dared do something with your sister instead.", "NTA.\n\nWhile she's sleeping on the couch, put a lock on the bedroom door and tell her she can get back in when she grows tf up.", "NTA. Your girlfriend sabotaged this all by herself, and now she's trying to blame you. She doesn't sound very invested in your relationship.", "NTA and you should probably find a better GF.", "So she wished you could have done this together (you *could* have\u2014you INVITED her) but thinks you should have \u201cgifted\u201d her the reservation so she could go with her friends (in other words, *still* not with you). And now she\u2019s pouting on the couch? Why are you with this person? NTA", "INFO: Why didnt you tell her? Surely it would have beeb a different case, if she knew where you\u2019d be going?", "NTA\n\nShe stated \"no restaurants\" so you made other plans for her birthday.\n\nNow she's upset because you took your sister but SHE wanted to take her friends. \n\nShe wanted a picnic and go carting. You gaver her exactly what she asked for. That was an excellent gift.", "NTA. She sounds like too much trouble.", "Nta. But this girl sounds like a brat.", "INFO why didn't you like tell her, though?", "NTA but when she mentioned not wanting to do dinner, did you mention you got the reservations for the day or just shrug it off? I know you wanted to surprise her, but missing the surprise is better than missing the special dinner you had planned.", "ESH. How old are you guys? It sounds like you have some pretty fundamental communication/understanding issues. \n\nYou told her that you wanted to spend the night with her, so she definitely shouldn\u2019t have blown you off. That being said, you should\u2019ve told her that you literally *planned* something, to make her aware that you had taken steps to do something for her. Saying that you want to spend the night with her doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you planned anything. \n\nEven if it\u2019s small, always get your partner a little gift on their birthday. Come on now. \n\nYour gf sounds super ungrateful, so I\u2019m sorry. She said she wanted to spend time with her friends instead of you, and then got mad that you had fun anyway.", "She's TA, but I can see from her perspective that you went to the restaurant she wanted to go with you with your sister instead on her birthday.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
