After a while when she was taking a nap i got into the kitchen and starting doing my own food. Later on she found out and told me that she will take my phone for 2 months for doing that not only, but i have to do the dishes in that whole period.\n\nTL;DR my mom is forcing me to eat her food even though i don't want to.", "created_utc": 1694345753, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ey1u1/aita_for_wanting_to_cook_my_own_meal/", "score": 11, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mother cooks, and your job is to eat what she dishes up. In saying this, a diplomatic option in the future is to offer to cook for the family.  I have to admit, I let my kids make their own, but I was never allowed to. My mother had a food and shopping budget and my job was to be grateful for what she provided.

But not a 16 year old, whom in many places would be considered near adult. She should be commending his independence instead of chopping him down to size. Its absolutely about control."]}
