Young children, however, with their filthy fucking hands, touch every damn thing in site. Hell, a lot adults in grocery stores are less sanitary than my dog, because again, all she touches is the floor, but grown-ass adults take poops without washing their hands and then go touch produce.

If my dog is well-behaved, and she is, any young child, and many adults, are a far less sanitary presence in the grocery store than my dog, because the only thing my dog touches is the floor. Yeah, that doesn't help the people who have severe allergies, but I kinda think the onus is on them to stay away from places that are dog-friendly, and in Seattle, LOTS OF PLACES are very dog-friendly. A lot of the places I take my dog have dog treats for her next to the register. And yes, I'm talking about grocery stores, and it's management who give her the treats and take a brief break from their work to say hi to her. If anyone thinks that makes me \"entitled\" I would argue that you don't know the meaning of that word. I live in poverty. My dog is an emotional support animal, which I am very aware is not even slightly the same thing as a service animal, and so I ask permission to bring her with me, and she is very well-behaved, and all of the places I bring her LIKE having me and her there. If anybody doesn't like that, they can find someplace else to live, because this city is known to be dog-friendly.

I keep her on a leash, and I don't let her approach anyone unless I can see that they want me to let her approach them, but she doesn't stay right by my side all the time, and that is scary to some people. The people who are scared of that have a phobia. 22lb is a small dog, and when she sees people, she smiles. Only someone with a phobia could be scared of her. I have empathy for those people, because I know that phobias typically are a result of trauma. I, too, have suffered trauma, and there are things I deal with because of that. So I'm not making fun of people who have a phobia of dogs, nor am I blaming them for having a phobia. That said, a phobia is an unreasonable fear, so if you have one, it's up to you to figure out how to manage that. The entire world can't change all the things that we take for granted as being normal because a few people have unreasonable fears of them.  \n\n\nI'm sorry, but it is unreasonable to be afraid of ALL dogs. That is a phobia. I have a very difficult time believing that dogs ALWAYS go aggressively after you. You think they are, and to you that is very real, but the only reason you think that is because you have a phobia. Just because the owner of the labradoodle had to grab them by the collar doesn't necessarily mean the dog was trying to hurt you. It very well may have been the case that the owner saw the look on your face and did the decent thing of leaping to action to keep their dog away from you, but for all we know that dog probably just wanted to play or maybe get petted.   \n\n\nDo you seriously not recognize that your view on this is skewed? Thinking that ALL dogs come at you aggressively is like thinking ALL humans come at you aggressively, except humans are actually far more aggressive than dogs as a whole.
