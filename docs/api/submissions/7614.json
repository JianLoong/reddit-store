I don't invite people over to my home (It's very small) and I don't even have a boyfriend so I have no idea where he got the idea from.

Do not feel any guilt.\n\nA word of advice, I would not tell anybody you were the one who called the police. Do not engage in discussion about it and do not confide this to anybody, if he finds out he is likely to be extremely angry and angry people are beyond unreasonable don't trust anybody with this", "NTA, sounds like your neighbor fucked around and found out. He got his Karma all at once.", "Not only NTA, but hell to the NO.\n\nWhen you are engaged in anything \"nefarious\", common sense would dictate that you ignore anything nefarious going on around you to avoid bringing any attention to yourself.\n\nIn this particular case, there is something about YOU that triggered him.  Are you too pretty?  Too confident?  Didn't smile enough?  Seriously, our \"smiles\" make grown men lose sleep!  So, he thought he would show you a little something, about who was in charge.  Problem was, ol' boy wasn't the choir boy he thought he was.\n\nDon't lose a moments sleep over the misogynist who will no longer be living below you.", "I can see why you feel guilty, because you never intended it to go this way. But consider the fact that if your neighbor had not repeatedly harassed you in MULTIPLE ways, you probably would not have even considered calling the cops on him. Ultimately, even though you made the call, he brought it on himself with his own A-Holery and hopefully this means you can take a deep breath and live in peace. You are definitely NOT THE AH. (NTA) and it's pretty clear that he is.", "NTA. I am not one to generally advocate calling the cops; however, I think you were justified. This person was repeatedly and aggressively harassing you with no evident reason. You are not responsible for his actions - and this sounds a lot like karma.", "NTA. You didn't intend for it to go that far and you seem to feel bad about it. I think he got what he deserved. It's not your fault he was breaking several laws and you didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA.  He is getting all that should be coming to him. \n\nAlso the drugs might explain him making all that shit up against you.", "NTA. Fuck that guy. I don\u2019t like calling the cops on people (and as a matter of policy, do not). But since he\u2019s done that for you without good reason, turnabout is fair play.", "NTA - If he hadn't been an AH on top of doing illegal things he wouldn't have a problem now. He made his choices, not you.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't build his house of cards. It's not your fault that it fell.", "NTA. I wouldn't feel too bad. On a basic level, he was massively interfering with your enjoyment of your own home. All you did was direct the attention of the authorities to his activities. They handled the rest. Consider the harm he's been doing to other people -- he was arrested for a reason. And now, hopefully, he won't hurt anyone else. And you can have your peace and quiet.\n\nJust don't let him find out it was you who tattled.", "NTA. Your neighbor had accused you falsely for many things and called the police. Now, he got caught red handed and doing things illegally, which you on the other hand, aren't. This is called karma, and he got to taste his own medicine. He messed around with you for no reason. I would celebrate for having that shitty neighbor out and for being able to finally live peacefully in your own place", "NTA\n\nGuy got karma'd. Don't feel bad. He got what was coming.", "It's not your fault he was doing illegal things, was unstable, and a horrible neighbor.\n\nNTA", "If he is trying to harass you out of the place, idk, maybe to better pursue his illegal activities, he'd do that to anyone who lived there. Odds on, someone would have called the police. He's also likely to blame you regardless of who called the police.  Seriously, don't tell anyone though.", "NTA - he was harassing you. It sounds like he got what he deserved in the long run.", "NTA, seems like a win for you. Nice work.", "NTA. This is a tough call, since I would normally side against calling the police. However, this guy has been harassing you with false reports for ages, and he had it coming. I think it was appropriate in the circumstances.", "Nta. You didn\u2019t make up his crimes.", "NTA", "NTA, he got what he deserved for operating an illegal gambling ring, and causing you other problems. The building is probably safer with him gone.", "NTA. Karma bit him where he deserved it.", "NTA\nScrew that guy. If you can't do the time, don't do the crime. \nAlso, naner naner, naner. He should've minded his own bisnitch.", "Honestly, I would call it self preservation. I mean, I don't know many stories of illegal gambling and drug dealing ending well?", "NTA.

Everything that's happened to him is a result of his own willing, knowing actions.", "NTA Don\u2019t feel guilty about what you did. Your neighbour did this to himself. \n\nIt\u2019s quite unbelievable what you had to go through.

If he loses his house maybe you\u2019ll get a better neighbor that actually respects you.", "NTA - karma can be a bitch and he got what was due. Don\u2019t feel guilty, he was the one participating in illegal activities and harassing you on top of it.", "NTA. He ruined his own life!  You did exactly the right thing!

You didn't make him break the law. He did that all on his own. You just brought it to the police department's attention.", "NTA You didn't ruin his life, he did. He made your area unsafe.

To be clear, he made the choice to engage in illegal activity.  You did not cause any of this.  You had every right to do what you did. But do protect yourself. Since he already has a grudge toward you, he could try to take his anger out on you - whether he knew you actually called or not. There\u2019s a good chance he\u2019s going to assume you did. Do not tell anyone you called. If you can, maybe put a camera outside your door or something. Just to be safe.", "NTA. He pushed you too far, and you pushed back.

I completely understand your feelings on the matter. \n\nI dont think you could predict that he'd get busted like that and turnabout is fair play. \n\nHe shouldn't have been such a ruthless AH.

I wasn't there when they arrested him but heard the noise from my apartment.

How can I be happy when I may have ruined his life.", "Look, if I was up to sketchy business, I would be the best neighbor. I would go out of my way to not bother them. I'd bring cookies on the regular and butter them up so that they would think I'm a nice person with lots of friends that come to socialize regularly. \n\nIf OP's neighbor hadn't been a complete ass, the worst that would have happened is that they would have asked to keep the noise down without getting the cops involved.", "I have never had so many issues with my neighbors before.

Our \"kindness\" as women should not be used against as, as a vulnerability.  The fact that you are second-guessing yourself shows you ARE a kind person.  But this person has reaped what he's sown; that is on HIM.\n\nAnd Sister, we are ALL pretty.

I understand the conflict of feelings, because you are a good person, but you aren't responsible for his actions; or the consequences of those (illegal) actions. \n\nIf it wasn't you, someone else, sometime in the future would have been fed up with your neighbors BS. Criminals tend to get what they deserve eventually. \n\nTake solace knowing he can't actively harass you anymore, at least for the time being.", "Because justice was done. He did evil things to you and deserved to be punished. He's going to prison, not an alternate dimension of eternal torture.", "You did not ruin his life.\n\nHe made his own choices, including making you miserable enough that you were ready to move away. He brought this on himself.", "You are not responsible for the decisions of other people.\n\nHe chose to run a gambling ring out of his apartment.\n\nHe chose to keep illegal drugs in his apartment.\n\nHe chose to sublet public housing in contravention of the law.\n\nHe chose to be *such a scary, creepy, scary creep* to you that you chose an entirely legal, justifiable way to get him away from you.\n\nHe also chose to be a *stupid* law-breaking scary creep by lying about you to the police instead of doing everything in his power to be completely innocuous.\n\nHon.  If he had been the nice downstairs neighbor who said hello and talked about the weather?  Or the standoffish downstairs neighbor who never said anything more than \"Excuse me\" to you and avoided eye contact?  You wouldn't be posting here, because you most likely would have seen the gambling and said to yourself, \"Not my circus, not my monkeys,\" and moved on.\n\nHe made himself your problem.
