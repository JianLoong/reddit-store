Tell them you love spending time with them, but feel like you're hired help (and getting paid nothing- good event photogs can make bank) at these events. Would they be willing to back you up and be united as a family unit to ensure you all enjoy the family parties. \n\nI know it can be difficult with kids, even if they're grown, and I don't know the dynamic, but I'm always honored when my family asks for help or advice (and we don't do it willy-nilly, we ask out of respect for the other person's abilities,) and would gladly go to bat to keep them safe and happy.", "Excellent -revenge \n\ntruly candid shots are all the rage now. all the best photographers take them  And One couldn\u2019t possibly go back to posed shots having learned what authenticity as a photographer really is. Lol.", "They\u2019re awesome at running interference. My kids are the best ever and I would fight wild boar for them if needed.", "Make sure they\u2019re blurry! Oh, and my personal favorite is the shot that cuts of their feet and leaves 10 feet of space over their heads, Lol \ud83e\udd23", "Scalper fees if anyone tries to prise the camera out of my hands. Although, I have all original Asahi lenses. If anyone tried it, they would probably hear me down the street, screaming to keep their hands to themselves.", "Stupendous!! I love to see it. Let them fight the wild boar alongside you in this instance- safety in numbers. \n\nIf the in-laws are still worming in, double fist legit anything. A drinks glass and slice of cake. A small child on your hip and a whole bouquet of flowers in the other. Grab 2 sticks off the ground, say your hands are full. Don't take your camera, firm no to all phones, eat all their food, and just enjoy the time with your kids and cool family members. \n\nBetween that and your kids keeping an eye out for the most entitled troublemakers, I think you'll be able to reclaim your respected family member and guest of the party status. \n\nYou've got this!", "That mass text to the inlaws thats been suggested... consider asking one of your kids to send it on your behalf.\n\nInstead of \"I'm tired of...\", it could be \"We're tired of this being foisted on our mom. We want her to be able to relax, catch up with family, get a bite to eat, etc. Y'all have phones. If you want pictures, take your own pictures. If you don't know how, ask [insert name of 8 - 10 year old realative or two], they can show you.\"\n\nAlong with getting the point across, it will let everyone know upfront that if they try to do it again, you will have defenders.", "I would also include photos of the dog going poo or marking tires, just because.", "Two dogs humping would be a bonus! \ud83e\udd23", "That would be hilarious!", "\"I am so very sorry you're not satisfied by my work. Of course, under these circumstances, I'll be making good on my 'Triple Your Money Back Guarantee'.\"  - and then pull out your wallet and mime counting out imaginary banknotes until she walks away. NTA", "NTA.  Photos are required?  That\u2019s nonsense.\n\nFor the next event, tell them that they will need to find someone else to meet any photography needs because you are done with it.   That situation sounds ridiculous.", ">Almost all of the family gatherings, photos are required to document said gatherings. <\n\nI had an enlightenment earlier this year when a long time friend passed away.  He was an avid photographer and \"documented\" his own and his family's lives.  He left boxes and boxes of photos, slides and, more recently, .jpgs'.  The family had a lakeside vacation cottage that they visited every year, and every year, they took the same photos.  They traveled a lot, and recorded their travels in pictures.  Unfortunately, there is nobody left who is interested in all those images.  He and his wife's parents and siblings are all gone, and it is sad, as executor, to have to discard all those memories.\n\nSo, the question to pose to those people is, \"Why?\" Does anybody really look at all that \"documentation\". There will come a time when time will run short.  There won't be time to ever look at it all.  There may not even be anybody left who is even interested in it.\n\nLife is too interesting to always have to look at it through a viewfinder.  Just say that if they need documentation, they will have to do it themselves, and that you can no longer afford to view life through a half inch hole. NTA", "NTA. You don't need to live up to family expectations. However let's stop pretending that you alone do all the work. This is just your contribution. Someone is cooking, cleaning, doing laundry, organizing and paying for all these family events, and wants something to show for all the hard work. If you dont want to do it, don't; BUT Contribute in another way.", "Ha ha ha ha ha!", "Technically, other people being unreasonably demanding is beyond OP's control. All that OP can do is set a boundary and stick with it.", "Photos from Iphone cameras are pretty good!  You can also edit.  Time for your family to learn how to use their own phones.", "Completely NTA.      \nNext family gathering, if you want, take pictures.      \n**SELFIE** pictures.      \nALL of them need to be selfie pictures.       \nJust saying.", "So then, why keep going? Your husband and his parents are gone. It sounds like you're only hurting yourself by going.", "Please remember to give them the \"friends and family price\" which is always double or triple the normal rate."]}
