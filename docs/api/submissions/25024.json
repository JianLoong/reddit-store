You were willing to do this work for him which he assumed you would do.  He is not considering what is best for you in order to help him.   He insulted you, by choosing his helper.  Divorced 5 years?  You owe him nothing.  You respected his presumption and would do this selflessly.   You are a good ex wife.  Attend the wedding and enjoy yourself.

The bride should be finding someone appropriate to do this task if he is somehow incapable of doing so himself. There are other family members going, no? Buses or planes with staff that can help him.

There's no reason he couldn't take his helper along before since he's suddenly able to now. \n\nGo to the wedding, be supportive for the step daughter.

Reading his responses I get some idea of why your relationship did not work out\u2026..", "NTA \u2014 taking his helper is exactly what he should have done in the first place. Absolutely go separately from him, the bride will be pleased to see you.", "Sounds like his daughter knew what was up and gave you your own invitation for reason- so you could come on your own and enjoy yourself seeing her get married. \n\nNTA. He\u2019s got a helper person for a reason, and it ain\u2019t you!", "NTA\n\nIf the bride invited you as your own person, then go and enjoy.", "NTA. You are divorced and you are no longer officially responsible for him. Go to the wedding and enjoy it! Let him cope as an independent adult.", "You have an invitation. You're 40. Do what you want. He's your ex. He has no say in your actions unless they directly hurt him.", "Not only are you NTA, it seems like you go above and beyond for your ex husband. That fact that you are willing to assist at this level of commitment speaks to your character as well as your level of empathy and maturity. I have close to 10 friends who are divorced and every single one of them legitimately hates their respective exes. This is like divorce goals status.", "NTA.\n\nYou're divorced, and not his helper which he has one already.  As for the wedding, if you have a good relationship with the daughter and were invited due to that, go and enjoy with her - just do your best to avoid your ex if you can for your own sake.\n\nOh and if it turns out you're somehow uninvited, they should pay for any thing you invested to go (clothes, hotel deposit, etc.) at this stage.", "That is exactly what I would do. You're divorced.  You don't owe him anything anymore. Nta", "NTA- That is the beauty of divorce. You are no longer responsible for the other person.", "NTA. Why on earth would you be the one assumed to be taking care of him?? It would be odd enough to room together, much less put him to bed.

It is not your responsibility to care for him. The only responsibility you might have is to be civil with him for the sake of your kids or something.\n\nIf he's been living without you for 5 years, he can do so for another 2-3 days during the wedding. That is an entirely reasonable expectation of him.\n\nHe may have been looking for convenient transportation and carpooling, in which case, fair enough for him asking, but he has no grounds to expect it of you, let alone to rely on you for any additional assistance he needs once you've arrived.\n\nNTA. Go enjoy the wedding!", "NTA \n\nYou have your own invitation. It has nothing to do with your ex. \n\nGo, enjoy yourself, be in the photos, drink, be hungover the next day, register for breakfast in bed and a late checkout.", "If you were invited in your own right you are free to attend.", "NTA - he's your ex - let him work this stuff out as an adult, this is absolutely not your role and anyone who would judge you isn't worth the time. God he sounds like he hasn't changed and you made the right call. Enjoy the day and spoil your step daughter on her day - that's all you owe anyone.", "NTA. He has a caretaker for a reason. If you were invited separately, then you should go.", "You are not related to the bride and divorced FIVE years from him.   Circus and monkeys comes to mind.  Don't explain and don't do it.", "NTA. Don't feel guilty or be guilt-tripped into helping him. You are divorced so you're not obligated to help him. He is an adult who can arrange his own assistance.", "If you have your own invitation then you were never actually obligated to go with or help him in the first place. So go on your own and enjoy yourself. Good luck op.", "NTA. He has a helper but is trying to make you fully responsible for his well being. That ship sailed when you two got divorced, so it's a mystery why he thinks this would be a natural turn of events. Go by yourself, enjoy the wedding, and don't be guilted into being your ex's caretaker.", "I don\u2019t think she should ever be expected to help her ex. He\u2019s living without her now and either is able to do some things himself or has a nurse helping why should her presence change things.", "The audacity right! Ty for your support!", "That's wonderful that you have a strong relationship with your former stepdaughter. Given that the situation with your ex is apparently rather fraught, it's even *more* wonderful that she's a grown adult and you two can have an relationship independent of him.\n\nI think what you really needed to hear from objective third parties is that it's really, really out of pocket for your ex to try to revoke your invitation \u2014 which you received from her, independently \u2014 because you would not act as his unpaid caregiver. And it is, it's truly unacceptable of him to do that. I hope he doesn't continue to try to use your relationship with his grown daughter to control or pressure you. If he does, you would be within your rights to discuss the situation with your former stepdaughter, because, again, she is a grown adult with whom you have a separate, positive relationship. (Although I would not do this until after her wedding if it can possibly be helped.)\n\nEDIT Ah shit looks like you have kids you still co-parent, which changes the cost-benefit calculation of trying to sidestep his interference in your relationship with his kid. But the point that he's behaving poorly still stands.", "Please go to the wedding and have a wonderful time. Enjoy yourself", "I need assistance for ADL's and would never ask an ex partner to do something like this. I don't know anyone who would, other than in an emergency. \n\nHe has an aide, this is literally what he pays them for. He will likely have to pay more for them to travel etc even if he already has 24h support, and of course the cost of a hotel room, which may be why he is unhappy about the idea. But that's an unfortunate cost of disability.", "What? How would you attending a wedding to which you are invited cause a scene or stress the bride out? Don\u2019t call and bother her with this. Your ex is will be fine with his helper, and you should attend the wedding by yourself, worrying about only your own needs and requirements.", ">she\u2019s rather have her father there happy and enjoying her day\n\nThis really depends on the relationship -- not all stepparent-stepchild ones are created equal, and it sounds like OP was a longtime co-parent with a teen dad. That's a very specific dynamic, even without the impact of ex's disability on a family dynamic.\n\nCertainly run it by her, but if one of my parents was trying to prevent a beloved family member of mine from attending my wedding, and generally leveraging me to make demands of them, I would want the opportunity to express my feelings about that.", "Or he could have been an adult when she was in HS", "NTA. I'm confused why he would even consider this option.  How important is this wedding to you. Ex will start drama. It's a guarantee.  I would consider not going at all. Maybe talk to bride and except her answer", "NTA\n\nJust be clear to your stepdaughter that you wanted to be there for her day, and confirm it\u2019s ok cause he Dad is upset you won\u2019t have the energy to be his helper also. Let her hear it from you.\n\nWhat others said \u2018she\u2019s not even your daughter be helpful around your kids\u2019 is very short sighted cause I doubt you\u2019d go if you didn\u2019t raise her a bit or see her as a daughter/person you care for. I\u2019d never think that way in such a situation, and can\u2019t imagine your stepdaughter would appreciate that logic at all.", "NTA, but talk about what happened with the bride first, explain your side and how he reacted. It would suck to go there and suddenly find yourself unwelcome. Better to know how she feels about the situation.", "NTA. He was clearly trying to use you for free help. Since you have your own invite, he can't forbid you to attend the wedding; only his daughter can.", "NTA ask the person who sent you and invitation if you can come. Not the jilted ex who nows realizes they have to pay to go and not use you.", "If you have your own invite, I'm not even sure what the question is.\n\nYou're both invited. Separately.\n\nNTA", "As someone who has a step parent and a great relationship with them after they got divorced from my mum, I would want them at my wedding and they would be missed if they weren\u2019t.

Tell her what happened, that it sounded like he tried to uninvite you but he may have just meant to go with him and you want clarification because you'd love to go for her but don't want to intrude.\n\nShe'll tell you one way or the other, he doesn't get to chose who she cares about and wants at her wedding.", "NTA\n\nThough puzzled. You've been together since high school and his daughter is from a previous relationship?\n\nAny rate, sounds like it should either be his family or his daughter's family who helps him out (as he's the father of the bride).\n\nYou are neither. Go. Enjoy the wedding. And if he asks why you're there when he said you couldn't come, smile sweetly and show him your very own invitation.", "NTA, you have no obligation to him. Hope he can get it together to attend with help HE arranges..", "NTA. Divorced when means he is no longer your husband. It's no longer your job to be his caretaker.", ">together since high school  \n>  \n>His daughter from a previous relationship\n\nYou were together since high school and he had a daughter from a *previous* relationship??", "NTA.

Firm no.", "NTA go separate it\u2019s not your job to accommodate your EX HUSBAND", "Your step daughter invited you to her wedding, so dad can suck rocks lol  nta", "NTA. If you guys have been together since high school I\u2019m going to assume it was a high school pregnancy and you were in your step daughters life since she was a baby. Since it sounds like she wants you there and you have a relationship you absolutely should go. If you think your ex is one to make a scene maybe discuss it with the bride", "Attend, and if ex says anything when he sees you call it a misunderstanding. He said you were no longer welcome to attend the ceremony with him. You respected that, but since you had an invite separate from him and you\u2019d already RSVPd, the couple was expecting you either way.", "NTA. You've been divorced for 5 years? Why on earth would you be his personal support worker?", "NTA\n\nYou were invited to the wedding in your own right, and as you're divorced there's absolutely no reason whatsoever to give him assistance. He has a support worker so they can support him!", "NTA. He an ex, you don\u2019t owe him any help. Go on your own and have a great time.", "NTA. He can't uninvite you, he didn't invite you in the first place. You are not his maid, you are his ex. Basically, a stranger with some shared history.", "NTA \n\nOf course it should be his assigned helper! Why on earth would it be you?!  You\u2019re his ex.", "NTA. Just because you two are.going to the same place at the same time doesn't mean you're obligated to assist him with his disability.  He has had 5 yrs to figure this out all on his own.\n\nOne thing I've learned about sharing a child with an ex is that they think just because we still talk is that we're friends and help them in their time in need. When in reality the only reason we do talk is because we share a child together. I've had to remind my ex of this a few times already and to not reach out to me unless it's regarding our kid. Looks like you need to give the same reminder to your ex.", "Entitled much?  Some, a very few, disabled people think the world owes them everything...and it doesn't.  Yeah the situation sucks but it is what it is.  He has no say about whether you go to the wedding or not since you have a separate invite so ignore that.  Go, enjoy yourself, dance your heart out with everyone, eat cake and get a little tipsy if you want...  It's a celebration!  NTAH.", "NTA and my goodness, does he think you're still married?  And if this was how he treated you while you were married, *yikes.*\n\nAsking you to provide personal physical care was an overreach.  You are not his wife.  You are not close to him anymore.  You are not his paid caregiver either.\n\nForbidding you to go to the wedding was a hilarious overreach.  Who does he think he is?

May help to give the bride a gentle heads up so she can shut it down without causing a scene.", "NTA. Your divorced? You have a super invitation, just go and ignore him. Why are you stuck being his carer when he can bring someone for support if needed.?", "NTA. My dad was in a wheelchair for years and he accepted what he could or couldn't do. So if we wanted to travel, at first we accommodate his needs but he realised it wasn't worth it because everyone got exhausted and he was in way worst pain. We had to hire someone to assist him. If he had events or something we'd ask the helper to do so paying her more. Him not wanting to bring his assistant and make you take the toll is selfish as heck. Don't even give it a thought.

Don't talk to him about it at all anymore correspond to him if he contacts you about it, and don't even mention it to his daughter unless she brings it up to you. Since you really want to go, just go, show up and have fun. If he says anything about the fact that he said you weren't allowed to come anymore, you can either just walk away from him or remind him that you had your own invitation, you were not his plus-one.

Your invitation is not contingent on being his caregiver. If you want, you can double check with the bride and groom, but the fact is that they knew you were divorced and they sent you the invitation.", "NTA, and we see why you divorced this idiot.", "NTA. He is your ex and you two divorced for a reason. It's good that you are still amicable, but there is a difference between basic decency and having outrageous demands. \n\nAsking you to hold a door open so he can pass through, is simple decency, as is picking up his keys or wallet, if they drop to the floor.
