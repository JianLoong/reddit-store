You don't need to be his caretaker any more. Obviously be kind and helpful for your own kids, which may include helping their dad out at events for your kids. \n\nBut this isn't even your daughter- you clearly care about her which is awesome of you. What your ex is asking from you is too much. He can bring his own assistance.", "Nta. He is your ex - you are under no obligation to help him. You are invited to the wedding in your own right - not as his plus one. Enjoy the wedding.", "NTA. Your ex was being unreasonable and can take his aide. You have your own invitation that's nothing to do with him.", "NTA. The fact she gave you a separate invitation, means she wants you there. You are his ex! The in sickness and in health part doesn\u2019t count anymore if you don\u2019t want to.", "NTA but call her and ask, her opinion is the one that counts", "I don't think you an asshole but do you want to be responsible for potentially causing a scene at your former stepdaughter's wedding? Obviously you have a cordial relationship with the bride, she invited you to the wedding. Perhaps you can call her and explain what transpired between you and your ex-husband and get her input.", "NTA everything you\u2019ve said makes sense. You offered reasonable options and he chose to decline. That\u2019s not on you. (I think you are super kind to offer to caretake your ex if you could go a bit early)", "NTA.\n\nIt all worked out it seems.  Go.  Have fun.  Enjoy yourself.", "NTA\u2026but I think you should double check with step-daughter. Your invitation may be more tied to your ex than you think. They may have only invited you with the expectation that you\u2019ll care for him.", "NTA He is *not* your problem anymore. Go and have fun.", "I\u2019d reach out to the daughter", "NTA.  Go to the wedding and have as little contact as possible with your ex.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nYou weren't invited as his +1 why should you feel bad about going with your own invite? He didn't invite you with him out of kindness in the first place he intended you to be his aide since he wasn't going to bring one. The gall of that man trying to treat his ex wife as a maid no wonder he's an ex.", "NTA. He\u2019s being quite unreasonable. That said, and without knowing the family dynamics, fair warning: if you decide to go and not help him (which is totally your right) he (as the bride\u2019s father) could find ways to make things unpleasant or have you feel uncomfortably unwelcome. And since he\u2019s acting like an AH, I wouldn\u2019t put it past him.", "NTA. You don't owe him a thing.  I assume he doesn't know you have your own invite and is blackmailing you.  Let him deal with his helpers and enjoy the look on his face when you arrive at the wedding.", "Nta. You are no longer required to help him out. He has helpers for that. You don\u2019t get to cry \u201cmy ex isn\u2019t helping me to my child (not hers) wedding\u201d. You are no longer responsible for that aspect of his life because you are the EX. Be diplomatic. \u201cI\u2019m sorry ex but I\u2019m not able to help you. You will have to find someone else to help you. If your helper can\u2019t come\u2026hire someone else for the trip.\u201d Then, if possible, stay at a different place from him.", "NTA\n\nHis daughter invited you, not him.

Is he just saving money on their T&E?\n\nScrew that shit.\n\nThat being said, my ex-wife's mother and father divorced when she was young. He basically left because of his mental illness and not wanting to be a burden to them  (among other issues). When he was dying in the hospital though, her mother, his ex-wife who had remarried 2 other times (1 divorce and the 2nd one passed away), came and took care of him for his last days.
