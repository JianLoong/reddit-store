He has assistance from someone else and isn't your responsibility anyway!", "NTA\n\nHe was being very entitled, just assuming you would do everything without asking you first.", "NTA. He is your ex, he has no right to ask this if you. How does he manage on a normal\nDay to day basis? This is how he needs to manage at the wedding. Go and enjoy yourself as a guest.

No one who is reasonable expects you to go out of your way to accommodate his needs, and no one who expects you to accommodate his needs is reasonable enough to be concerned with.\n\nAnd since your invite isn't connected to him, anyway (because, again, you've been divorced for 5 years) your attending has absolutely nothing to do with him or what he's doing.", "No.  You gave him options.  You were willing to do this work for him which he assumed you would do.  He is not considering what is best for you in order to help him.   He insulted you, by choosing his helper.  Divorced 5 years?  You owe him nothing.  You respected his presumption and would do this selflessly.   You are a good ex wife.  Attend the wedding and enjoy yourself.  Hopefully he has enough finesse to not speak badly of you to other guests.  There would be no need for that.  It's apparent you had an amicable divorce and remain friends.  That is the way things should be at the wedding.", "\u201cEx husband, I am unable to adequately care for your needs. You will need to make other arrangements.\u201d\n\nSimple. To the point.

I remember my parents inviting an idiot relative to parties because he had a pretty big car and ge would drive my aunt and grandmother.", "NTA but as he's the father of the bride, you should check with the bride that when he says you can't come, he isn't speaking for the happy couple.\n\nIf your refusal to care for him has caused you to be disinvited, you shouldn't go. If he's just saying he doesn't want you as his guest, that's fine, but do check you're not crashing a wedding", "Go to the wedding.\n\nNTA", "Why would this fall on you? The bride should be finding someone appropriate to do this task if he is somehow incapable of doing so himself. There are other family members going, no? Buses or planes with staff that can help him. People he can hire to come with him to get him ready.\n\nNTA. He is sounding petty and a bit lazy. Use your invitiation and have a good time.", "NTA it will cost money but he needs to bring his helper not depend on you. \n\nYou\u2019ve been together since high school but he has a daughter from a previous relationship?", "NTA. This is your ex husband. You owe him nothing.", "NTA. You're not his caretaker. It's not fair he demand you act like it. There's no reason he couldn't take his helper along before since he's suddenly able to now. \n\nGo to the wedding, be supportive for the step daughter. Let the ex be his own miserable self without dragging you down. One of the best lines I've ever heard was from the movie Clueless,  \"We divorce wives, not children. \"", "NTA. It\u2019s one thing to get along and help someone, but as a divorced couple his personal care is no longer appropriate or reasonable. Reading his responses I get some idea of why your relationship did not work out\u2026..", "NTA \u2014 taking his helper is exactly what he should have done in the first place. Absolutely go separately from him, the bride will be pleased to see you.", "Sounds like his daughter knew what was up and gave you your own invitation for reason- so you could come on your own and enjoy yourself seeing her get married. \n\nNTA. He\u2019s got a helper person for a reason, and it ain\u2019t you!", "NTA\n\nIf the bride invited you as your own person, then go and enjoy.", "NTA. You are divorced and you are no longer officially responsible for him. Go to the wedding and enjoy it! Let him cope as an independent adult.", "You have an invitation. You're 40. Do what you want. He's your ex. He has no say in your actions unless they directly hurt him.", "Not only are you NTA, it seems like you go above and beyond for your ex husband. That fact that you are willing to assist at this level of commitment speaks to your character as well as your level of empathy and maturity. I have close to 10 friends who are divorced and every single one of them legitimately hates their respective exes. This is like divorce goals status.", "NTA.\n\nYou're divorced, and not his helper which he has one already.  As for the wedding, if you have a good relationship with the daughter and were invited due to that, go and enjoy with her - just do your best to avoid your ex if you can for your own sake.\n\nOh and if it turns out you're somehow uninvited, they should pay for any thing you invested to go (clothes, hotel deposit, etc.) at this stage.", "That is exactly what I would do. You're divorced.  You don't owe him anything anymore. Nta", "NTA- That is the beauty of divorce. You are no longer responsible for the other person.", "NTA. Why on earth would you be the one assumed to be taking care of him?? It would be odd enough to room together, much less put him to bed. You\u2019ve been divorced for 5 years!", "You say you were together since high school. \n\nHis daughter is from a previous relationship. \n\nHow old was he when he had here?", "You are not his wife nor his caretaker. It is not your responsibility to care for him. The only responsibility you might have is to be civil with him for the sake of your kids or something.\n\nIf he's been living without you for 5 years, he can do so for another 2-3 days during the wedding. That is an entirely reasonable expectation of him.\n\nHe may have been looking for convenient transportation and carpooling, in which case, fair enough for him asking, but he has no grounds to expect it of you, let alone to rely on you for any additional assistance he needs once you've arrived.\n\nNTA. Go enjoy the wedding!", "NTA \n\nYou have your own invitation. It has nothing to do with your ex. \n\nGo, enjoy yourself, be in the photos, drink, be hungover the next day, register for breakfast in bed and a late checkout.", "If you were invited in your own right you are free to attend.", "NTA - he's your ex - let him work this stuff out as an adult, this is absolutely not your role and anyone who would judge you isn't worth the time. God he sounds like he hasn't changed and you made the right call. Enjoy the day and spoil your step daughter on her day - that's all you owe anyone.", "NTA. He has a caretaker for a reason. If you were invited separately, then you should go.", "You are not related to the bride and divorced FIVE years from him.   Circus and monkeys comes to mind.  Don't explain and don't do it.", "NTA. Don't feel guilty or be guilt-tripped into helping him. You are divorced so you're not obligated to help him. He is an adult who can arrange his own assistance.", "If you have your own invitation then you were never actually obligated to go with or help him in the first place. So go on your own and enjoy yourself. Good luck op.", "NTA. He has a helper but is trying to make you fully responsible for his well being. That ship sailed when you two got divorced, so it's a mystery why he thinks this would be a natural turn of events. Go by yourself, enjoy the wedding, and don't be guilted into being your ex's caretaker.", "I don\u2019t think she should ever be expected to help her ex. He\u2019s living without her now and either is able to do some things himself or has a nurse helping why should her presence change things.", "The audacity right! Ty for your support!", "That's wonderful that you have a strong relationship with your former stepdaughter. Given that the situation with your ex is apparently rather fraught, it's even *more* wonderful that she's a grown adult and you two can have an relationship independent of him.\n\nI think what you really needed to hear from objective third parties is that it's really, really out of pocket for your ex to try to revoke your invitation \u2014 which you received from her, independently \u2014 because you would not act as his unpaid caregiver. And it is, it's truly unacceptable of him to do that. I hope he doesn't continue to try to use your relationship with his grown daughter to control or pressure you. If he does, you would be within your rights to discuss the situation with your former stepdaughter, because, again, she is a grown adult with whom you have a separate, positive relationship. (Although I would not do this until after her wedding if it can possibly be helped.)\n\nEDIT Ah shit looks like you have kids you still co-parent, which changes the cost-benefit calculation of trying to sidestep his interference in your relationship with his kid. But the point that he's behaving poorly still stands.", "Please go to the wedding and have a wonderful time. Enjoy yourself", "I need assistance for ADL's and would never ask an ex partner to do something like this. I don't know anyone who would, other than in an emergency. \n\nHe has an aide, this is literally what he pays them for. He will likely have to pay more for them to travel etc even if he already has 24h support, and of course the cost of a hotel room, which may be why he is unhappy about the idea. But that's an unfortunate cost of disability.", "What? How would you attending a wedding to which you are invited cause a scene or stress the bride out? Don\u2019t call and bother her with this. Your ex is will be fine with his helper, and you should attend the wedding by yourself, worrying about only your own needs and requirements.", ">she\u2019s rather have her father there happy and enjoying her day\n\nThis really depends on the relationship -- not all stepparent-stepchild ones are created equal, and it sounds like OP was a longtime co-parent with a teen dad. That's a very specific dynamic, even without the impact of ex's disability on a family dynamic.\n\nCertainly run it by her, but if one of my parents was trying to prevent a beloved family member of mine from attending my wedding, and generally leveraging me to make demands of them, I would want the opportunity to express my feelings about that.", "Or he could have been an adult when she was in HS"]}
