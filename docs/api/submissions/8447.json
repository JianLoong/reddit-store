You'll have absolutely no way of getting your investment out of it without legal protection, and I guarantee you he knows that. Think real hard, just think. What other little things has he done that are off, cruel, disrespectful, using only your money, etc. It's probably been building up, hasn't it?

You could do a loan with him signing a promissory note, granting you a lien on the property for security and repayment that includes interest or a share of the profits, to be completed by a specific date.

I don't see from anything you wrote that you committed yourself to helping.  In fact, you told him you wouldn't do it.  I also don't see anything he offered to you in return, such as a percentage of ownership, title to his ride, etc.\n\nBut be kind: Give him the phone numbers for several of those \"We buy your house in any condition\" companies to help him bail out of his apparently bad decision.", "NTA.  Seems like he thought you would buy the materials and he would rake in the profiits, maybe paying you back what you spent.", "NTA,  may a propose an idea I haven\u2019t seen anywhere? An explanation for why he may want your help with materials.\n\nThink of this as the chance to design and build your dream house. Is the an opportunity to renovate this house and the two of you move in there together?  That is the only reason I can see for him asking your for money", "NTA You told him not to do it because it would take a lot of work and materials. Then he does the opposite of what you suggested and wants YOU to pay? Uh no. The first thing you do when buying a house to flip is to do estimates on each room. Poor planning on his part and trying to take advantage of you monetarily only makes him look even more foolish.", "NTA. Probably going to end up ruining your relationship though. Not because of you, but because of his poor judgement and planning.", "NTA. If he doesn't have the capital to start a house flipping business, then he shouldn't start a house flipping business. It would be like if he started a food truck and wanted you to pay for the truck's gas and new tires.", "NTA You told him you didn't want anything to do with it before he bought it.", "NTA\n\nYou told him you wouldn't do it. He bought it. He owns it. It's up to him.

Nice", "NTA as long as you don't expect anything from the sale of it.", "NTA. OP, only help him if he's willing to sign a contract or to put your name on the house. As things are, he has everything to gain and you have everything to lose. Don't get sucked in.", "Maybe or maybe he just wanted my opinion. If he can\u2019t afford to buy the materials, then he can try getting a loan from a bank.", "No I don\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want to be apart of his project. I do hope he can flip it so he doesn\u2019t get screwed.", "Or, OP could create a legal contract with the help of an attorney whereby her purchases contribute to percentage ownership of the house. I'm sure a real estate attorney could draft something.", "mmmmmmmaybe she should consult with an attorney before signing anything", "His plan: ask OP to pitch in. \n\nHis budget: mostly OP\u2019s money probably", "This is what I was thinking - he can take a loan from the bank, or if OP is willing he can set up a binding contract with her to pay it back with some minor interest after the sale of the house.", "Agree because a real estate attorney will know what to include what should not be and will know things others may not (for instance, construction loans often have an assignment of rents included) but they would know the possible pitfalls", "For something high risk like that. You\u2019d want a percentage ownership. With a clause that they have to sell the house by x date or buy back your share at the fair market value. Either by getting a loan to pay you or being compelled to sell the property.", "NTA, even if you get a promissary note for an unsecured loan or go as far as making him take a second mortgage on the property for you to loan him money, he is still just a boyfriend and this is going to put a big wedge between you. I think it was OK for him to ask but more OK for you to decline. And if he keeps asking, them this is a huge red flag of worse things to come. If he has never done this before he is not going to be seeing you much because of all the work on the house - it will be his new girlfriend and he is less likely to succeed so you will be out a boyfirend and your money.", "Agree plus an equity sharing agreement may not be a good solution either because if the place isn\u2019t finished he may have to sell it at a loss", "yup, when you see someone waving a knife then stabbing people. The \"waving the knife\" was the red flag."]}
