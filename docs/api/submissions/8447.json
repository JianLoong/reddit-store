Nobody currently lives there.  He\u2019ll live in it as he remodels it if he does buy it. We went there and peaked in the windows. It seems like it needs a lot of work done. The whole house seems like it needs to be updated. I told him I wouldn\u2019t do it because it\u2019s going to take a lot to update it. He told me he can do a lot of the work by himself. I said, I know you can because you\u2019ve been a contractor, but it\u2019s going to take lots and lots of materials. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll spend several thousands of dollars on the materials. \n\nHe thought about what I said and bought the house. I don\u2019t own it and my name isn\u2019t on anything. About a week after buying the house, he asked for my help with buying the materials. I told him NOPE! You wanted to buy a fixer upper and flip it. That was your decision that you made on your own. I never held a gun to your head and made you do anything. If you couldn\u2019t afford the materials that\u2019s your own fault. You\u2019ll have to figure out how to purchase the materials or just live in it as is!  I do NOT own the house and I\u2019m NOT living in it.

You clearly have no benefit here whereas he does, and you only lose. That\u2018s exploitive and a red flag.", "NTA. he made his bed, now he's gotta get it up to code.", "NTA. You have zero to gain here and everything to lose. He gets the equity and you get nothing! You have no way to get your money back from him if the relationship goes south. You advised him against it and he went ahead with it. Not your problem.", "NTA. He should have had a clear plan and budget going into this project.", "NTA.  It's *his* house, so it's *his* responsibility.", "NTA - The price of building materials is triple what it was pre-pandemic. Not an exaggeration. Purchasing materials without your name on the house is an enormous risk at best.", "NTA - if you broke up, and even if you stay together, you'd likely never see that money back.  And he bought a place to flip in a falling market after the peak of a bubble?  Don't walk, ***run*** from giving him money for this.", "NTA. It would be a bit different if you were on the deed/any part of it, but if you don't have a claim to it you shouldn't be giving monetary assistance in flipping it.", "NTA - He heard you but is not listening to you; there is a difference. \n\nHe did what he wanted then had the gall to ask you to buy materials.", "NTA. He should have made a plan with you before buying the house if he wanted your help or for you to pitch in. You voiced your concerns, and he bought it anyway and it\u2019s crazy if he thinks you should buy the materials.", "NTA, bless, if he pushes, he\u2019s not your person. Do not, do NOT, put anything into it, who knows how much he will need.", "NTA\n\nHowever no one likes a 'I told you so' you're nope could have been a lot better if you intend to carry this relationship on.", "NTA, def don't shell out thousands on a boyfriend's passion project.", "NTA. Because, what's in it for you? Is he going to pay you back plus some, with the profit he makes when he sells it? I would have said the same thing. you did this, not me, I have no part in it, so I am not going to help you by buying supplies.", "NTA. IF he wants your help make a contract up that states he owes you for material cost if you break up/sell the house. Take him to judge judy if you wont pay.", "NTA\nIf you trust his work, write up a little contract that guarantees you 50% of the house, regardless of the outcome, then buy some materials WITH him.\nWin-win.", "NTA. And I think it is very telling he expected you to help buy materials for something only he bought.", "NTA Did he say why he thinks you should pay for materials? I'm just wondering how convoluted his logic is.", "Of course you're NTA. You made your views clear before he bought even. Even if he offers you a cut of the resale, if you're not interested, you're not interested.", "NTA, be careful he might want to take advantage of you", "NTA; it's his house, not yours.\n\nIf he's offering to split the proceeds with you, and if you're into it, that's another thing. But he shouldn't just expect you to lend him money because you're his girlfriend.", "NTA - He is a major A H for not knowing how he was going to afford to flip it BEFORE he bought it.  Hold your ground!", "NTA. It sounds like bought the house knowing he would need someone to finance and tried to drop it on you. That's a red flag for me. Making huge financial decisions and expecting someone else to help pay.", "NTA\n\nCommunity property is one of the MAJOR differences between cohabitating and marriage. You have no reason to invest in something you have no stake in. \n\nFeel free to ask for loan rate or equity in the house if you do, but no reason to invest significant money in any friend's business without a payout for you. Boyfriend, best friend, freind-of-friend, you owe them nothing, and don't necessarily want them owing you.", "NTA\n\nIt might be fine to buy some stuff if you were going to get a cut of the profits but it doesn't sound like you really wanted to get into flipping houses as an investment anyway.", "NTA\n\nYou have no ownership stake in the home.  Why should you pay for materials for a home you do not live in nor have any ownership of?", "NTA\n\nHe made a choice, now he's not enjoying the consequences of that choice.", "NTA and honestly I\u2019d be thinking long and hard about if I wanted to spend the rest of my life with a dude who expects me to be responsible for fixing his \\*expensive\\* poor decisions especially when I was the one who told him it was a bad idea in the first place!!!", "NTA. Sounds like his mouth wrote a check his ass can't cash. Major red flags around financial irresponsibility.", "NTA - Its his responsability", "NTA\n\nbut just say no.  Just say you don't have the \"extra\" cash for it,  that you aren't spending your money on that, and firmly say no.  I agree with you, you shouldn't fund his project if you are not a part of it. \n\nThe rest of it is going into AH mode, with the intense blaming, the \"I told you so\",  \"it's not mine\", etc.  \n\n\"You wanted to ...\"\n\n\"That was your decision that you ...\"\n\n\"that\u2019s your own fault ... \"\n\n\"You\u2019ll have to figure out ...\"\n\nFYI: You can just say \"no\".", "Info- How did the conversation actually go?

This isn\u2019t your present or future home.  You get 0 financial benefit from selling.  Is he asking for a loan or gift?  What interest is he offering?  What guarantees?  There is no reason for you to spend a penny on this house.  Don\u2019t lend to friends and don\u2019t invest in projects with no return.", "But like, what is his logic for thinking that was an appropriate thing to ask? Why would he think you would agree?", "I feel like you keep mentioning its not your house To maybe get some sympathy or because you\u2019re salty about it. If your finances aren\u2019t combined and he put the money towards the house then of course only his name is going to be on the house. A relationship is a partnership and you should try to help each other out if you can. That being said NAH you don\u2019t have to pay for anything you don\u2019t want to but he is free to ask. I would say if I was in your shoes I would offer to loan him money if I had the extra that wouldn\u2019t hurt me at all but if I did I would have him sign a contract of repayment so if something happens you have proof.", "I\u2019m not loaning him money to buy the materials. If he pushes, that\u2019s a red flag like someone else said.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t want to take the risk. If things went south, I\u2019d have to spend more money on court costs. I know a relationship is a partnership, but I don\u2019t have to pay for his house. If he wants to make me pay, then we should go our separate ways, and he can take me to court if he wants. I\u2019m sorry this is how I feel. I\u2019m not mad at your comment, thank you for replying \ud83d\ude42", "Couple of things. Why would he take you to court? Don\u2019t feel sorry about how you feel. Also I saw another of your comments about if he pushes then you will just ghost him which seems to be a weird thing to do in a three year relationship. You might want to review your relationship because it seems like maybe you are just looking for a way out of the relationship. If you aren\u2019t happy with the relationship either talk to the person about fixing it or break up. You don\u2019t want to be one of those people hat are together for someone for years while unhappy you deserve better", "Idk, why he would take me to court lol. He should not take me to court. If He wants push it, then I\u2019ll probably ghost him because it\u2019s a red flag like someone else said. I didn\u2019t say I was unhappy with him. I just don\u2019t want to be taken advantage of. If he pushes me about loaning him the money, then he might be trying to take advantage of me. That\u2019s all. \ud83d\ude42"]}
