I asked where he was going and he said he & family were going to eat out but I wasn't invited because his mom \"assumed\" that since I wouldn't be familiar with the food and \"how to eat it\" it there at the restsurant, then it's better for me to stay-in and eat at the hotel. I didn't argue I just let him go then I packed and took the first flight home. He freaked out and called many times and when he found out that I went home, he blew up snd called me ridiculous and irrational to do this. Even said that I acted in an ungrateful manner and embarrassed him infront of his family after he literally begged to have me go on the trip. We argued and he started giving md silent treatment after he came home. Moreover, his family are indirectly criticizing me on facebook about what I did.\n\n\n\nDid I overeact?\n\n\nEdit1 he didn't even mention what type of food they ordered.\n\nEdit2 the family didn't plan on having me come along but my husband, like he said \"begged them\" to invite me.

When it comes to world class rudeness, this one is right up there.\n\nDoes your husband even **like** you???", "NTA - It's offensive for your husband and his family to exclude you from this dinner.

He should have shut down that garbage the moment it started spewing from their mouths.", "It sounds like you have a husband problem.  He went along with you not being included to go to dinner? That is incredibly rude and disrespectful.  He didn\u2019t defend you.  He could have declined the dinner invitation and gone out with you instead.\n\nIf you want this relationship to last, you both need to go to counseling to learn communication and boundaries.

If you stay married to him, you'll be treated like this forever and I mean even after in-laws are gone. Run!!!!", "No you are underreacting, the correct response in this situation is to serve your husband with divorce papers.

But then you stood up for yourself in epic style. \n\n\"Class\" does not matter because their behavior was freaking trashy af, but your response was classy af. \n\nGood on you!", "NTA - I don't believe I've ever heard anything more bourgeois than deliberately excluding your own wife from dinner during a trip and telling her to eat room service. It's one thing if the MIL doesn't want OP there....but for husband to go along with it and not refuse to go if she wasn't invited is unconscionable. It's 2023. A wife isn't subservient to the husband anymore that they should be happy with table scraps if they 'married up'. The family embarrassed themselves and if I were OP, I wouldn't just be booking a ticket home but calling the sharkiest divorce attorney I could find.", "NTA\n\nBut this isn\u2019t just about your in-laws.

That was an extreme response but their behavior was so far out of line, I don\u2019t blame you.", "NTA - There's ignorance and being backward in this post but none of it is yours.

Your husband embarrassed himself and your MIL is the ignorant and backwards one.", "NTA but your inlaws and unfortunately also husband are major ones.", "NTA.

Beg you or his family? \n\nOP I\u2019m so sorry but you two need to sit down and talk.

Cuz otherwise you wouldn't have been invited?? No. None of this is ok.", "NTA. Your inlaws didn't exclude you because they think you are low class. Your husband did.  He is ashamed of you.
