We have 2 children aged 3 and 18 month. I am currently 3 months pregnant with our 3rd child.  \n\nMy mum \"Sandra\"(48f) has recently had a baby with my bio dad, the baby is 2 months old. I don't have any sort of relationship with my bio dad as he left my mum when I was born leaving her alone with me and my older sister. We have a step dad Mark who i call my father, he has divorced my mum after finding out she is having an affair with my bio dad.  \n\nTo the events: I have always dreamed of a romantic proposal which is something Luke was aware of. He has prepared and booked in a room in a high end restaurant, had it decorated for the event and also had his friend to take and edit a video of the whole thing (his friend is a professional and does fantastic videos). Luke also invited people close to us, so my friends, my sister and her wife, Mark and my mum. As this is a high end restaurant it doesn't accept kids under the age of 12 and has a warning about it on the website. Luke has also asked people invited to keep their children at home (the booking was made a good few months in advance). We have hired a trusted babysitter for ours. It is also important to note that he knew we won't be able to get married soon until our kids are older as I wanted them in our wedding and somewhat to remember it.  \n\nAt the event we found out my mum took her baby with her instead of leaving him with my bio dad. When I have asked her about it, she said the baby is quiet and it is not her first child so she knows how to look after them.  \n\nWell, when the music started playing (it started rather quiet) and my fiance was ready to give a speech, the baby started crying. Luke has tried to carry on but nobody could hear him due to the screeching sounds the baby started to make, and I was feeling overwhelmed with it as my romantic proposal was getting ruined by my own mother being selfish. So I have asked her to leave.  \n\nMy mum has tried to argue to stay and was creating a scene, but I ended up asking security to escort her out. The rest of the day went without issues but after the event was finished I have received dozens of messages from my mum and bio dad calling me an asshole for what I did.\n\nEdit: paragraphs.\n\nAlso wanted to add, the child in question is not my mother's biological child. The child biological mother is one of my bio dad's girlfriends who wanted nothing to do with him, so my bio dad and my mum adopted the kid. My mother is also insisting her grandchildren to call the kid uncle, which is something me and my sister are against of (one of my sister's kids is 8 and therefore are older then the child).", "created_utc": 1687853377, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14k7fbr/aita_for_kicking_my_mother_and_her_baby_from_my/", "score": 866, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Leaving", "Well, a respectful parent will step out if the baby starts to make noise/be an issue.  I've been to many wedding where people brought babies and it was a complete nonissue since the parents are just responsible about it. If the kid starts to fuss or make any noises (even happy ones) during a time that is supposed to be quiet they parent just quickly exits with them. (Or sticks a boob/bottle in their mouth maybe? Possible but the point is I've never noticed and been bothered by noise.) \n\nI see posts on reddit about people who bring their babies to events or restaurants and then just let them cry and disrupt things, but I've never personally experienced that in real life. (Crying baby on a plane, yes, but I understand parent can't step out of a flying plane.) It's always an older child, teen, or adult (often but not always drunk adult) who is too loud for an event in my personal experience. And adults don't have any parents to whisk them outside or shush them when they are being too noisy. Actually,  I work at a school that has weekly spirit assemblies in the morning parents can attend. The kids all sit there in their class lines rather quietly and we all have trouble hearing the principal with the microphone beacuse a bunch of parents are choosing to hang out and chat through it. (I get it's not very interesting probably, but there is zero requirement of any kind the parents stay. They could literally just go stand outside the school and chat with their parent friends.) \n\nObviously, if the venue says not to bring little kids then don't bring little kids beacuse you follow the rules. But the problem person in this story is the adult OP's Mom. She's an entitled cheater with a bad attitude who badgers people with texts when wrong, can't follow the rules of the places she goes, and makes a scene when asked to leave so has to be removed by security.
