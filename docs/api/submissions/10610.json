She Isn't the most intelligent (it is impossible to hold an interesting conversation with her, because she has no interests and mostly nothing interesting to say but she is very beautiful so men just adore her). I decided to not invite her to my birthday party, because I don't want to lose the guy I am dating. If he sees her beauty, he might lose interest in me, like other guys in the past. However she wished me happy birthday and said she has a gift for me and asked if I will celebrate. I lied and told her I won't but I feel a bit bad about it. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit : you are all right. I will tell her the truth, that I am doing bday party and I will invite her.

Ditching your friend due to something she has no control over, and based on something that might happen is an AH move.  Doubling down by lying makes it worse.

Part of growing older is the realization that you will not be the prettiest person in the room (or the smartest, or the most interesting) and you simply need to get over it.", "If your boyfriend runs off and chases her you didn't want him anyways.

If your boyfriend is willing to trade you for your friend, he will trade you for any beautiful girl that isn't your friend. It would actually be better if they met. So you can see if this man has any self-control. Being afraid to lose him means you're too emotionally codependent to be dating. Being that scared will only make you some one who drops your standards and tolerates. They could probably flirt in front of you and you'd get rid of the friend before you get rid of the man. \n\n1 more thing. Is he officially your bf or are you just calling him that?

If boyfriend ditched you for friend due to that, good riddance to boyfriend! More beautiful women will always come along, a relationship can\u2019t be based on being the most beautiful in the room.\n\nHowever, you mentioned  friend is flirty. This is where I would need to know more about friend before making a call here. You could feel this way simply due to insecurity, but you could also be picking up on legitimate flirtation where friend truly seeks male attention from all men - even friends\u2019 guys. And if the latter is true, then that is a legitimate problem that is feeding your discomfort. It\u2019s one thing to have a beautiful friend, quite different to have a friend who flirts and wants attention from every guy in the room. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about protecting your boyfriend though - even if she is flirty he should absolutely be loyal to you. This is about whether this is a good friend who honors boundaries and acts respectfully and trustworthy. If friend crosses boundaries and truly does flirt and seek attention from friends\u2019 men, then that is an unhealthy friendship and I say back off that friendship. No true, good friend would do that.\n\nBut this is where you have to be careful, is she truly flirting or is this just jealousy?
