Wife said it was okay for me to stay over. \n\nWe then found out that she booked in a spa trip, which I apparently said was okay, on the same day I'm supposed to to leave for Manchester. We have kids, so regardless of whether I stay over or not, she couldn't go to the spa. \n\nOnce this was realised, she got upset and said I can't stay over and should instead make my way back home. If all goes to plan, earliest I'll be home is around 11:30pm. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi all\n\nFor context, we live in London. My work has an event next week in Manchester which is all day. The actual work part of the event finishes at 7pm and then it's on to dinner and drinks. I usually don't like staying over at places as I don't sleep well in hotels and it means my wife is by herself to get the kids ready for school etc. Most of the time I either decline the event or come back the same day. \n\nI initially told my wife that I would just come back home. Yesterday, she booked a 1 night hotel stay in Birmingham to attend a distance, relatives graduation. \n\nShe'll go up the day before in the morning.\n\nNext day, the event starts at 2pm and finishes at 4pm \n\nDinner booked at 5pm \n\nTheir train back to London (she's going with a friend) is at at 7pm. \n\nShe'll the spend the night at this friend's house before coming back home. So, leaves Tuesday morning and comes back Thursday evening. \n\n\nBirmingham isn't far, and there is no reason why she needs to go the day before the event and stay over, leaving me with the kids to get ready for school. I don't mind but the hypocrisy just fell on me.\n\nAnyway, I made a joke pointing out how she could stay in Birmingham but I couldn't go to Manchester. Nothing more, and didn't say anything about staying over. Out of the blue, she said she was okay with me going. I said thanks and booked the tickets and hotel. She then asked me what day it was and it fell on the same day she had booked off to go to a spa. Now, we share a diary and this (my trip to Manchester) was in the diary months ago. I messed up by not checking the dates properly, maybe, before I apparently confirmed she was good to go to the spa. \n\nOnce I told her, she then said I can't stay over at Manchester and needed to come home. Keep in mind that the spa day is the day I leave for Manchester so she can't do the spa (we have kids) regardless if I stay over or not. It was like she was refusing to me staying over out of spite. \n\nIn short, I put my foot down about it.

It's for work and who needs to commute at 11pm. Period.", "Sorry, I may have to write this again as I've done it in a confusing way. My wife said I can't stay, AFTER saying I could. She pulled back on it when we realised she has to cancel her spa trip (she has to do this anyway as I HAVE to be in Manchester for work. Ideally I would want to come home but that means coming back at 12am earliest. \n\nThe overnight trip and her spa day are two separate things. I only booked the Manchester trip because SHE told me I could stay (and I didn't even ask).", "This is how I\u2019m understanding it also and I would love to know OPs thoughts because I\u2019m toggling between Y T A/E S H", "No, that's no the reason I'm staying over. I was planning to come back home and SHE said I could stay over but pulled back when she realised it was the same day as her spa. Regardless, spa has to be cancelled as I'll travelling that day.\n\nONLY reason I thought it would be wise to stay is because the earliest I could get back home would be 23:30pm or so. Last thing I want to be doing is walking home late, whilst it's raining, dark etc.", "There\u2019s no hypocrisy here. OP made the decision & \u201ctold wife\u201d they would come back on the same day of the event. Then changed their mind after wife made her plan to stay over. \n\nSpa day has zero to do with anything.", "Yes. She didn't check the diary. Neither did I when I said it was okay. Just thought work day, I'm usually at home so fine. Forgot to check the Manchester trip.", "She did check, read at the end when admits to messing up when he agreed. He doesn't like sleeping away from home, so I am assuming she thought he would be back home.", "Yeah that\u2019s a really annoying trip to do round trip in a day. Their point-tallying is annoying and poor communication, but for practical reasons I\u2019d stay over too and just get back in the morning.", "The wife didn't check either. OP had his trip in their calendar.", "Work trip in the shared diary. Spa day can easily be moved and will have to be moved regardless as I'll be travelling to Manchester in the morning.", "I'm still confused.\n\nAt the start you say: \"I initially told my wife that I would just come back home.\"\n\nWhich I took to mean you *were* planning to go to your work event, and come back home after (presumably because you don't like staying in hotels.)\n\nThen, you say: \"I made a joke pointing out how she could **stay** in Birmingham but I couldn't **go** to Manchester... I didn't say anything about staying over.\"\n\nThat makes it sound like you weren't planning to go to Manchester *at all*.\n\nThen your later conversations all seem to centre around *staying overnight* and don't address the obvious fact that you **must** attend the work event and therefore she **cannot** go to her spa day without hiring a sitter.\n\nLastly, why do you want to stay overnight if you don't want to stay overnight?", "I\u2019m pretty primed for Y T A regardless but trying to keep an open mind. I don\u2019t like that OP is playing these mind games and coming here to bitch instead of just talking to his wife. She had to interpret her passive-aggressive comment to mean he wanted to go to Manchester overnight.", "I am guessing you\u2019re a perfectly capable & fine person \u2026 you are an adult. If you need to stay over for a work event then you manage your travel accordingly. You seem to want to point your fingers at your wife for not managing your schedule. She \u201csaid I could stay over\u201d what does that even mean? Were you not allowed to stay over before she said that? Or were you just trying to be thoughtful & then decided if wife can do it than so can I?\n\nIf you changed your mind about staying at a hotel then just say that. I changed my mind dear\u2026 I have decided to stay. Your wife is also an adult. She will have to react accordingly. If it\u2019s now a pain in the ass because you just decided to change your mind don\u2019t expect people to be understanding if it messes up their schedule.\n\nThe spa day is completely irrelevant to this entire thing because that\u2019s your wife\u2019s mistake & problem to solve. Has nothing to do with you staying over. \n\neta", "No, nothing changed from me. I made a comment in jest and she then said I could stay over. She then pulled it when we realised the day I travel to Manchester is the same day she was supposed to go to the spa. However, it's important to realise she can't go to the spa regardless.\n\nI'm struggling to agree with her reason why she changed her mind as it makes no difference to her spa. Just seemed to be out of spite", "I have to go to the event, but the plan was to come back the same day. When I initially told her about Manchester, she said she didn't want me to stay over (this small fact may be what's confusing you, sorry) and I agreed.\n\nForward a few weeks, I then made a comment about her hotel stay. All in jest, but she said I could stay in Manchester. Thinking of the time I was originally due to come home, weather etc. I accepted and booked.\n\nRealised it was on the same day of her spa, me traveling, so then she told me to come back straight away.", "You knew about this work event. You had all the details & information. I am assuming they haven\u2019t changed the schedule. If you knew it would be better to stay over when you found out about this event then why did you tell your wife you would be home? Did it just suddenly occur to you that it would be better if you stay over? I\u2019m guessing no. Your wife scheduled a trip & decided to stay over. You thought well \u2026 I think I need a night off as well.\n\nY\u2019all are adults \u2026. Just figure it out. Stop trying to prove that one of you are right & the other is wrong.\n\neta \u2014 I have been married for 32 years we have 4 kids. It\u2019s totally fine to say I\u2019m taking the night off. You don\u2019t have to justify your decision by making this about each other. Well you did this, so I\u2019m doing that. Nope. Everyone gets to do what they need to do & take a break from each other & kids. It\u2019s absolutely fine. Your job gets an automatic win over spa day. (Which has nothing to do with this)", "Why do you think it was out of spite? It\u2019s a weird thing to assume your spouse feels towards you. \n\nIt sounds more like she was trying to make the schedule work. I assume she knows you prefer not to stay in hotels overnight, and assumed that if you\u2019d be able to make it home earlier, she could go to the spa day and you could sleep in your own bed. Win win, no?\n\nThen you told her you have to go to the work event which is the same day as the spa. And that\u2019s that.\n\nI do not see the conflict you\u2019re seeing in this situation.", "Forget about the spa/schedule stuff for a minute. What's with the \"joke\" you made about not being able to stay over in Manchester? You've said a few times you don't even want to stay over.\n\nI understand the practicality of staying over even if you'd rather be home, but then what is the relevance of her own overnight trip? Why is hypocritical for her to do something she wants to do and for you not to do something you *don't* want to do?\n\nAnd if you did *want* to stay over this time, why didn't you just say that instead of making the passive-aggressive \"joke\" that your wife had to interpret to mean you wanted to stay over?\n\nYou are N T A for the schedule mishap, or for attending your work trip over her spa day, but YTA for your frankly abysmal communication and passive-aggressive nonsense."]}
