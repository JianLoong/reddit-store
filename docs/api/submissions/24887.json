You lied to the father of your child. \n\nYou are depriving your daughter of her father.\n\nAnd I find it really dishonest, why claim that you cheated?\n\nWas he abusive in any way? Is he a danger and/or harmful to you and your daughter?\n\nIf yes, I can understand.\n\nIf not, you're just a liar, who only thinks of herself. You are selfish.\n\nYou might not want him in your life, but your daughter has the right to know the truth and, if she wishes, to know her father.\n\n\"Me, me, me,\" but have you thought about your daughter's well-being?", "Yeah, YTA.

He still deserved to know. He could have been given the opportunity to choose to leave or raise a kid. \n\nAnd on top of that, you lied again and said you cheated? As if that scenario would make anything more acceptable\u2026? \n\nAs for your daughter, lying about how she was conceived and hiding her real father is going to backfire hard on you one day. That\u2019s going to cause her emotional trauma when she finds out you lied, and it\u2019ll only be worse the more you try and keep it up. You\u2019ll be lucky if you won\u2019t have a strained relationship with her if she were to find this out now.\n\nETA: he wants to meet her too? You\u2019re about to be in some real deep shit here. Your daughter should know who her real father is before she hears something through the grapevine. They also deserve to see each other if that\u2019s something your daughter wants too.", "YTA\n\nYou took the decision from him to be involved or not.

Plenty of people don't want kids but when it happens that all changes. Hopefully he gets a lawyer and you are forced to let him see her. Lieng to your daughter is another big AH move.", "YTA\n\n\nI've known more than one man who swore they never wanted kids only to have that tiny little bundle completely rule their world from the moment they were born.  You never even gave him that chance. \n\nYou also have lied to your daughter. A lie that you will most likely get caught in at some point and it will probably cause her some issues psychologically.  \n\nI'd stop doubling down at this point and at least be honest with your daughter.  I also think that the bio dad has a right to know as well", "YTA\n\nSaying he does not want kids can easily change when there is actually a child.  You never gave him a chance.  Plus he should be paying child support.  \n\nYou lied to your daughter.  You lied to your ex sister-in-law.  \n\nHe is around.  That is his daughter.", "YTA, both your daughter and your ex have right to know this situation, you dont give much information here, if your ex is really bad person then maybe you would be right but if not, they should know.", "YTA. Your question was disingenuous from the start. You didn't not tell an ex about your child. You didn't tell an ex about HIS child. He couldn't have forced you not to have the child and you've said he wasn't abusive so ultimately you've created this horrible situation where he has missed out on her childhood, she has missed out on having a secure attachment with her father, and she is going to have to live her life knowing her mother's lies kept her from having a normal relationship with her father. Don't be surprised when she grows up to resent you (rightfully) and see you for the villain you are. \n\nWhy didn't you tell him? He didn't want kids... So? Lots of people don't want kids and then life happens and they step up and become brilliant parents. You didn't even give him the opportunity to think about whether he wanted to step up or not. And legally he has every right to have access to his daughter and I hope for her sake he pursues this in the courts to get part custody.", "YTA. He had the right to know, you could have cut contact with him if he were to pressure you into having an abortion. And he has a right to meet his daughter as she has to meet her father.", "YTA. It takes 2 to make a baby, and your daughter has a father. You were worried the time, I get that, but she was born and he has a right to that kid as much a you do, the very least to know that she exists! \n\nHe is her father, she is growing without that figure, that can mess someone up. Also she is going to be raging when she is older and finds out (SHE WILL) that she had a dad that wanted her all along. People have the right to change their minds, and also to decide if they want to be present for their children. You took something huge from him and from your daughter, but you still have time to make it right...", "YTA, you made a choice for him and your shared child without consulting him at all. He has the right to know his child, his child has the right to know him.", "YTA\n\nYou treat him like a donor. \nHe wants to have contact to his daughter and you refuse, without giving him a chance. Without saying something negative about him beside that 8-9 years ago, he \"maybe\" did not want to keep the baby. That's nearly a decade ago.", "YTA.\n\nIn short, there were multiple points at which you were faced with a decision (telling ex about the pregnancy, telling your daughter how she was conceived, telling SIL about the daughter, telling your ex again about the situation) and each time, without fail, you decided to lie and be deceptive, and now you're surprised that things aren't going smoothly.\n\n>I'm an AH for not wanting to have him involved in my daughter's life. I don't think they're right.\n\nThey are. She's not *only* your daughter, she's also his. You denied him his parental rights, *and* you denied your daughter a father. You unilaterally made a decision on behalf of two other humans that what's best for them, both as individuals and as family, doesn't matter. That clearly makes you an AH.\n\nNot to mention the potential legal ramifications of this.", "YTA:  I'm not even talking about taking this man's opportunity away to be a father but the fact you lied to your daughter about who her father was.  You did that because you know if you told her the truth at a young age she would not be happy to know you purposely hid her existence from her father.  \n\nWorst part is she's now old enough  to resent you for this", "YTA what gives you the right to keep his child away from him?  I love how it takes 2 to have a child and in a lot of cases like this, women make the arbitrary decision what's right for \"their\" child.", "YTA. He had the right to decide by himself what to do", "YTA. Your daughter has the right to know her father.", "YTA, you could have still kept the baby even if Mario asked you to abort it. You did not even ask him and instead had his child in secret and denied him the opportunity to know his child. No matter is opinion on children, he deserved to know that she exisited.", "YTA. You straight out lied. \n\nHe might not have wanted kids, but he might have changed that when faced with a different reality, and grown up. And your daughter might have had an involved dad for 8 years now, you are taking that from your daughter. If you had died accidentally in the meanwhile, she could have had a parent she was familiar with, more family, more resources. Literally you could have had more resources for HER OWN SAKE by asking for child support or him spending time with her.\n\nYour mental health does not trump the rights of your daughter, for sure, nor, though less clearly, his rights to actually grown up and be a dad.", "Yta. You had no right to keep him from her. I hope lose custody and get jail time...", "YTA, you didn't even give him a chance,for all you know he could have been an amazing dad.", "I know both women and men who said they didn\u2019t want kids than had oops pregnancies and turned out to be great parents but I\u2019m guessing by your attitude on the post he probably just didn\u2019t want kids with you YTA", "YTA.\n\nListen, your past actions are a mess and you were wrong for telling so many lies but you\u2019re mainly an AH toward your daughter. Not because she needs a father in her life, or that she needs this particular father. She may have been doing as totally fine as you say. And he may prove to be an awful man not up to the job at all. We have no way of knowing.\n\nBut he can take this to court. The court can order a paternity test and then he has every right to go after shared custody. The fact you lied and kept his child from him will be used against you. It could be very messy and very drawn out and that is the very very last thing your 8 year old needs in her life. I\u2019d suggest finding a child therapist who can help guide the conversation, and telling your daughter the truth and helping her through this really hard and confusing time. And letting him meet her on your terms.", "This kinda behaviour should really be criminalised imo YTA", "YTA and he has legal rights to his daughter. It really doesn't matter what you want. And you lying to so many people about it could hurt you legally if he pushes for any kind of custody.", "YTA. I'm willing to bet you'd be PISSED if someone did the reverse to you. (yes, ignoring temporarily that the woman obviously always knows she's the mother.)\n\nYou say you did this because you \"thought\" he didn't want kids. But that turned out not to be the case, so even the orignal reason falls apart. Whatever reason your relationship didn't work out, this goes beyond that and involves other people whether you like it or not. A judge will probably say that too, so it's probably in your best interest to work out a solution before it comes to that.", "YTA with out having a conversation with your childs father you lied to and manipulated 2 people because how you think things might have gone. Its incredibly selfish of you to decide these things on your own and fuck up two peoples lives because you think your some sort of perfect person who really knew what was best for them with out even telling them the truth. Pretty disgusting.", "YTA and I hope he takes you to court for it and you just accept it or risk losing that relationship you have with your daughter permanently", "I mean, he supposedly didn\u2019t want children so I get that part. But you could have told him you were pregnant and then if he didn\u2019t want to pursue the relationship further you could have left and lived your life without him like you did. I\u2019m not sure why you lied to him about cheating. He clearly had an interest in knowing if this was his kid, someone who didn\u2019t absolutely want kids wouldn\u2019t go out of his way to reach out and ask why he wasn\u2019t told. I was ready to say NTA when I first started reading (where you said he didn\u2019t want children), but then it kind of spiraled from there. YTA from keeping it from him, he should\u2019ve been given the chance to know his kid when you found out you were pregnant. You didn\u2019t give us any idea specifically how we\u2019re supposed to know for sure that he didn\u2019t want kids, so that part is truly iffy to me.", "YTA\n\nYou made horrifically selfish choices, and your daughter is going to resent you for them. She's 8 right now, and she isn't missing something she didn't know was an option. That's not going to last forever. The older she gets, the more she understands relationships and families, the more questions she's going to have.\n\nAnd when she meets Mario - not if, when - and he tells her that you lied to him, you tricked him, and you kept away a father who wanted to be involved, she will hate you for it.\n\nJust because it's better for you does not mean it's better for her. What you want isn't the only thing that matters here. Bad parents put themselves first. Good parents put their children first. Don't be surprised if Mario contacts a lawyer, as is his right. Stop making decisions for other people, and think about what's best for your daughter. The best time to do that would have been right at the start, but the second best time to do it is right now.", "I am going to say this for all the women in the back that can't hear...IF YOU KNOW WHO THE FATHER IS AND YOU DON'T TELL THEM THEN YOU ARE THE AH EVERY. DAMN. TIME. I don't care if the genius that got pregnant by them in the first place says that they are not fit. You slept with them, obviously they weren't all bad right?\n\nNow the Redditors of the world will say, \"what if he was abusive? what if..blah blah blah\". No, you are not a good person. Even trying to go as far as saying that your child is now an affair baby?? Shameful.", "YTA\n\nYou didn't give him a chance to step up. A lot of people don't think they're ready for kids until it happens. If you had tried like a decent person he could have been there for her, and if he choose not to at that point it puts the bad choices on him but instead they're on you now. \n\nThis not only hurts him but your daughter as well.", "You should have given him the option to decide, no matter what he said before when it was just a scare. No matter how you felt and what you thought he would do, it was his decision to make when he heard about the baby. You decided for him and took away all his options. YTA and you are still deciding for him and your daughter, who you lied to blatantly.", "YTA. When she's old enough to understand, your daughter will not forgive you for denying her a relationship with her father. I get that you were in a tough situation, but the choice you made was vile and it will come back to haunt you.", "YTA. You may be the biggest asshole I have read about on here.\n\nWithout talking to someone, you \"thought\" you knew what he wanted and decided that he does not get to even know about his own child.\n\nI am really happy that I do not have someone like you in my life.", "You are a GIANT YTA lady! Like, I honestly can't even believe someone can be this evil and selfish. I really hope Mario sues you for joint custody, 'cause ur daughter obviously needs a good parent and role model in her life.", "YTA your post makes it clear you are only thinking about yourself and what you want. If your daughter is able to have an involved father, she deserves that. And he deserved a chance to either step up or step out when you got pregnant.\n\nYou could have done this above the board and given him options to sign his rights away but instead you lied and probably traumatized your kid from finding out in this way.\n\nBe a parent. Facilitate a meeting. Let your daughter decide what she wants. Give him a chance to have visitation. Grow the fuck up", "Eh, I kinda see your POV. He said he never wanted a kid and you didn't want him to cause drama. \n\nMeet with him and ask why now is different than before when he wanted you to abort? If he really wants to be involved, get a lawyer and get that back child support before he can see her.", "YTA. \n\nThe entitlement displayed never ceases to shock me. What gives you the right to deprive a father of a daughter? A daughter to her father? You admitted there was no abuse, but because it\u2019s \u201cyour\u201d daughter (and not his, right?) then you get to make that decision\u2026for the three of you. \n\nI hope he takes you to family court.", "Your daughter may hate you in the future you took away the chance of having a father you must let him into her life you should have told.", "I'll go out on a limb here and say NTA. You had a pregnancy scare and he made his views clear. \nIf he wants to know her just to appease his family not because he wants to be in her life for real, then he is just a donor for your daughter.

Get a clue, lady.", "If she doesn\u2019t want a father, it\u2019s because you indoctrinated her to not want one. She wasn\u2019t born not wanting a father.
