Important to note: I was the first person there. \n\nWithin 5 minutes, the class was pretty much full with only 2 bikes left at the very back near a speaker. I normally avoid bikes in that general area because I find the speakers way too loud. \n\nAbout 2 minutes before the class started, Some guy I've never seen before came up to me and said \"Hey, that's my bike, I always use that one\"\n\nI looked up at the person and just said \"Sorry, I want to use this one and I was here first, there are two free bikes over there.\"\n\nThe person got quite antsy with me and started spouting off about how he \"hates all these new people coming to the gym and ruining his time. And that he didn't want to sit near the speaker blah blah\" However, he was forced to take one of the free ones because the instructor came in and started the class.

To make matters worse, the instructor even said \"Mike, why are you at the back this week!?\" on the PA system before shrugging and then just continuing on.\n\nOnce it was over, I could hear him talking to people about how annoying it is that people are \"ruining the gym\" and \"no one here has manners anymore\" etc etc and they were all agreeing with him. \n\nSo, AITA for not moving for this guy?

You said twice in your posts you are a frequent gym goer and you\u2019ve never seen him before. \u201cAs a reminder, I've been coming here for ages and never heard of or seen this dude in my life.\u201d So you are going back to your normal schedule anyways, and you won\u2019t see him (and he won\u2019t have to see you lol) because you haven\u2019t before.", "People may hate me but NAH. \n\n\nYea, he tried to get \"his\" bike you refused and he walked away. He didn't argue he just mumbled some things to himself.  He then complained to his friends about the situation.  That's normal for people to do even of they're in the wrong. \n\nBut he didn't do anything particularly assholish to you. Sounds like you had a 5 sec interaction of give me my bike...no....ok (sit on another bike)", "INFO: during your regular class do you use the same bike every time?", "NTA. This is giving sour old lady stinkeye at the new family visiting at church for sitting in \"her\" pew. \n\nDon't let Mike get you down.

Back when I was doing classes in the gym, I had **my spots** but I was usually early **and** if someone else took \"my spot\" I would take a different spot. There was even one class where people had offered to move so I could have my spot back but I refused and took a different spot. i **get it** that he wanted that spot, but tough luck.  \n\n\nIgnore the mean people. I've heard people being all snooty about \"the january people\" or the \"new year's resolution\" people. Like they had dibs on the gym.\n\nNTA", "What exactly would you say to management?  \n\nSome guy told me to move off my bike, and when I said no, he got on another bike.  Than he said he doesnt like new people in the gym.", "Honestly, normally I would just comply but I can not cope taking the bike near the speaker so I spoke up. I think he's someone that's just been going to this gym for so long that he's made lots of friends. Or he's got some sordid past that I need to find out lol", ">\"Hey, that's my bike, I always use that one\"\n\nThat's entitlement, I'd call that acting like an AH for sure. The gall for him to act like it is his *right* to ride it, or even having *priority* over someone else that claimed it already, is awfully ridiculous.  \n\n>The person got quite antsy with me\n\nHe also directed his mumbling at her, and if it sounds like he's speaking to himself but it is actually audible by those around, it's a virtual guarantee he's only doing so with the purpose that it is overheard by other parties, including probably OP. That's AH behaviour. \n\n>hates all these new people coming to the gym and ruining his time.\n\nHis time is more valuable than other peoples'? New people shouldn't visit the gym? That's AH behaviour. \n\nYou're far too generous in your twisting/interpretation of OP's words.", "Nah, him spouting off at her after she politely told him no was totally wrong. No is a complete sentence. Him whining to her face about her new customers show his entitlement and dickishness.\n\nBut yeah I agree complaining to his friends is fine", "I don't necessarily disagree. But the big issue for me is how he was loudly discussing it with people and made me feel really uncomfortable over something that was super trivial.", "Yes, mostly. But if someone takes it I'll just choose a different one. I wont do the class if the only bike is near the speaker - but that's only happened once.", "this is awesome \ud83d\ude0e", "That he is creating a hostile environment. Calling people rude and cursing under breath and talking to other members saying that \"new members have no respect\" and a \"ruining the gym\" is not acceptablle.\n\nTalking to managment can nip that childish behavior in the bud before it gets out of hand.", "Double check with management that bikes aren't assigned?\n\nAnd ask in the future if you she is harassed for using gym equipment, what should she do?", "To me sounds like he was saying that to himself as he was walking towards the bike. I can be wrong but that's how I interpreted it", "Yea it sucks that he was loud but is he not allowed to complain to his friends? If he was doing it pointedly and like pointing you out and making about you in particular that's different but you say he was just saying \"new people at the gym suck\" which is a common attitude at gyms :/", "If it\u2019s that trivial then why didn\u2019t you move bikes? It\u2019s because it wasn\u2019t really that trivial and you know it. He was complaining to his friends, which he\u2019s allowed to do.", "The point of my question was to prove the point you have a routine and prefer the same bike every class. You also just pointed out in your response you skip class because of the seats near the speakers which were also the only ones left in your story. I\u2019d say ESH, you painting the picture over someone acting irrational over a preference you have yourself while they overreacted to someone not willing to give up their usual bike.", "The only thing I would agree with what you said is if he was cursing but OP never said he said that. \n\nBut saying it's not acceptable for him to complain I don't.  I'm a manager in a gym lol. All long term members complain about new people. That's their opinion. People complain about new instructors.  It's their opinion.  A gym can't tell people hey you must not say anything negative about our gym when you're in here", "Bikes are 100% **not** assigned. I regularly attend classes and know for a fact they're not.", "And he's still an AH. No one is entitled to a specific bike unless there's a reservation system. First come first served. I'm guessing if there was an alternative bike that wasn't right in front of the speaker she would have moved. Another example of this is on a plane if someone asks you to move from the window or aisle to a middle seat so their family can sit next to each other. F-off with that BS.", "I totally see where you're coming from. But I wouldn't then give someone shit for being on my preferred bike, nor would I complain about it to my gym friends in an obnoxious way. He also chose to stay in the class on the bikes near the speaker.", "well a gym can ask people not to be childish and make others feel uncomfortable. Opinions are fine, childish behavior ,especially at a gym needs to be watched. Heck trying to call dibs and force someone out of \"thier bike\" should be enough for a manager to say .\"hey mike, chill\""]}
