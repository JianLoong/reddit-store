I'm a manager in a gym lol. All long term members complain about new people. That's their opinion. People complain about new instructors.  It's their opinion.

Legends don't whine.", "NTA! That\u2019s really crappy of the instructor to say that too. \n\nI go to a class routinely and have had someone sit on the bike I *usually* go for. For a second I was like Owh in my head, and then because I\u2019m an adult I just used a different one no problem. \n\nPeople get mad though if you \u2018take\u2019 their spot, a lot of entitlement out there", "Indeed, they don't seem to have much in the way of manners.\n\nMike doesn't own the bike.

In our one spin class a retired married couple comes, separately every time, she\u2019s always late, and he \u201csaves\u201d her a bike. I personally think this is bullshit but he is a regular member and an ex-colleague of my husband\u2019s so I never say anything. But one day the class was full and she arrived late as usual. I know this is petty but I was kind of pleased to tell her there were no more bikes. However, the instructor\u2019s wife was taking spin that day and she got off so \u201cJen\u201d could use her bike. People like this really irritate me.

The instructor is an AH, shouldn\u2019t of mentioned Mike being on a different bike. Unless you can reserve the equipment when you register, in this case a bike, it isn\u2019t his to claim. And let me tell you, scheduling software definitely has the ability to reserve equipment when you sign up for class. If the gym doesn\u2019t have the option when you register and this is an issue then the gym is an AH also. Or gym should tell Mike it doesn\u2019t work like that. Stand your ground OP. And next time tell Mike just bc he doesn\u2019t see you in his class every single day/week doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not a regular. Mike sucks! Take his bike every time you get the chance.

I have ocd so I would love to have \"my bike\" in a spin class lol. What a luxury. But I wouldn't imagine telling someone to get off \"my bike\" when in fact it's the gym bike. That kinda behavior should get an unofficial warning at least."]}
