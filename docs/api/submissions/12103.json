I told that if not, i would be able to bring my lunch and eat amongst everyone without any problem. It\u2019s something I do sometimes at big family gathering, because I don't expect everyone to be extra careful everytime for me. Vic told me that everything should be fine. 4 days before de the wedding, I texted again to be sure, and she said that the menu does not contain any of my allergens.\n\nWedding day; on the family brunch, I started to feel bad in my tummy. I privately asked to the chef if anything contained any nut/coconut and hold and behold: the sauce for the egg contained coconut. I excused myself and went back home (20 minutes away from the venue).

I texted my brother to excuse myself, that i won\u2019t be able to come to the ceremony and i would try to come to the celebration.\n\nSo around 8 hours after the brunch, I was capable to go back to the celebration. I did my wedding toast to my brother and after, Vic came to me and ask why I was absent from the ceremony. I told her that the brunch did contain coconut and I passed the whole day on the toilet, that i\u2019m glad i was able to come back to the ceremony and did not needed to go to the hospital. She then left back to my brother and spend the rest of the evening talking to guests.\n\nNext day, I\u2019ve received many many text from my brother, saying i was an \\*ssh\\*le to told her during her wedding day that she was responsible of me being sick and that I\u2019ve should told her some lies to make her happy. He told me she cried the whole wedding night about this. Since then, I've received texts from family members, friends, bridesmaids, who called me an \\*ss for ruining her wedding night.
