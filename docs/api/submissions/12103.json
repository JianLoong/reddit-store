That is, if they were truly told \u2026 don\u2019t know why wouldn\u2019t be but maybe bc she knew you weren\u2019t anaphylactic that it \u201cmight be okay\u201d \nIt sucks you missed their wedding but it was no error to you and you showed back up when you could!", "she asked you told her.....  your NTA    just call your new SIL and explain that you don't blame her for anything it was an honest mistake, things happen sometimes.  you are just disappointed you couldn't support her and your brother during the ceremony.   sure you could of said you just felt ill and needed to lay down but you weren't really thinking it would hurt her feelings.   just try talking to her.  I am sure everyone else is hyping her up and making this so much bigger then it really was.", "NTA\n\nThey should be apologising to you AND going to ham against the caterers\n\nWe had this at an upscale restaurant - they bent over backwards for the affected guest (apologies, champagne, free dinner etc)", "NTA. My brother has a lot of food allergies, and the kind where his throat will close if he eats them. When I got married, I told the venue (they had on-site kitchens) about him, and they actually offered to straight-up make him a separate meal if they couldn't find something he could have off the menu. So either your allergies weren't mentioned, or someone really messed up with disclosing what was in the food. That is serious no matter which one it was, and certainly no reason for you to be put on low contact, UNLESS your new SIL didn't actually believe you about the allergies, and brother didn't bother checking to make sure you would be accommodated.", "nta", "NTA. You had been adamant about what you couldn't eat, and she swore there were no foods you were allergic/sensitive to, but there was. I took have a good I have an allergy/sensitivity to (banana), and will ask if I suspect something contains it. My reaction is nothing like yours in that if I ingest a little banana I just wind up feeling like I have a cold or something coming on in my throat for the next 2 or 3 days. By letting her know WHY you had to skip out it lets her know exactly how serious your allergy/sensitivity is so that in the future she can be a little more thorough in making sure there's none in unexpected places (I honestly would have never thought of a sauce for eggs having nuts or coconut in it). You should sit and talk to her to let her know you don't hold her responsible since it was in something most people wouldn't expect it to be, but that she can use it as a lesson in checking out specific ingredients used in dishes in the future. Will say your brother is a light AH, and other guests are totally AHs simply because it's really none of their business. If you'd lied, she wouldn't know how bad it is for you, and might end up getting more foods with nuts or coconut for future catered meals.", "NTA\nIf you had lied Vic would have been mad at you for not showing up because your reason wasn't \"good enough\". I want to know what lie she would have accepted and what your brother \"wanted\"  you to have said??\n\n\"Sorry I missed the ceremony, I had to go home because I was allergic to some of the food at the brunch and had to spend the rest of the day on the toilet\" means she can't be mad at you for not coming but she IS mad so now she's had to be mad at you for.... Telling the truth..??", "I get that she was a bit flustered about the news but she shouldn\u2019t have acted out at you. It\u2019s either her fault or the catheter but in no way yours. NTA", "NTA. Tell them that the caterer ignored their requests regarding allergens and that you could have been poisoned to death by their mistake.\n\nI'm assuming your sister-in-law is not a child, so she should be able to cope with the fact that you were the person harmed, not her. If her wedding night was ruined because you got poisoned, then that's on the caterers, not on you.", "NTA unless you personally blamed her. By what you've posted, it sounds like you simply explained that you had an allergic reaction and had to stay away.  If that's the case, then your brother is in for one hell of a marriage with her and her drama\n\nMake sure your other family member know that you only meant to explain what happened. It was probably an honest mistake and that you're NOT blaming her. Otherwise I worry she'll go to them for more sympathy", "Nta but I do think your SIL feels like shit and didn't know what to say to you in that moment. Give her time to calm down and I bet she will reach out to you.", "2 options I can see \n1. Stay home like you did until the allergen is out of your system ( like you did)\n2.  Go to the wedding and shit yourself in public. Well that would have made the wedding memorable for all the guests. \n\nHer reaction is her choice not yours. Let her know that you don\u2019t make it a habit of lying to her and did not want to start this new chapter with her as you sister with a lie.", "NTA.  Your new SIL and brother are massive assholes though.  And anyone who agrees with them is an asshole too.", "YNTA-I have basic rules for my life: 1. Always tell the truth even when it will cost you everything. 2. Always act ethically even when others will not. 3. Always behave morally even when you will never be seen.  Telling the truth is never wrong.  EVER.  The fact that she decided to take it as an accusation says more about her than you.  YNTA here in my opinion.  I know that many people see \u201cwhite lies\u201d as no problem.  But I cannot agree.  When lies become tools of social acceptance who will draw the line?  Who decides what is the acceptable lie and what is not?", "NTA\n\nShe asked and you answered", "NTA. She asked. What other excuse could you give? Oh sorry, there was a new episode of Rupaul on, couldn\u2019t miss it\u2026. Anything but the truth would have been feeble.", "NTA!", "NTA \n\nas someone with a peanut/tree nuts allergy myself let me just say, I am so sorry you had to go through this experience. For future reference, I unfortunately learned the hard way that you should always ask the people preparing the food about allergens. Its really sad but some people just don\u2019t bother to ask, or just figure since it\u2019s not a a walnut salad, there\u2019s nothing to worry about. \n\nChefs will understand the proper protocol for handling food for people with allergies. They\u2019re who you need to ask before eating any food, not family members. I wish we lived in a world where we could trust family with our health and safety but we just can\u2019t. The stakes are too high", "NTA.  You told her of your allergies and she said it would be ok. It wasn't and you had to leave and she asked you why.\n\nShe shouldn't have asked if she didn't want to know the truth.", "NTA, what a headache Vic is", "NTA Vic didn't forget she didn't pass on the information to the caterers she did it on purpose. I can't believe that your brother knowing what happens is mad at you. He should try getting to the bottom of this.", "NTA - What the heck else did they expect you to say? Also, I\u2019ve got a few stomach issues similar to what you described and for that reason I always have anti-diarrhea medication on me. Just for future reference they make Pepto Bismol in chewable tablets that are individually wrapped.", "You have a legitimate allergy, she brushed it off, then gets mad at YOU because you had a reaction and were honest about it???\n\nYour SIL is a self absorbed B. NTA. Clearly she couldn't care less about you, I'm sorry she is now married into your family lol", "NTA", "NTA. Someone seriously failed at keeping you safe and the cause should be determined and addressed. People can die from being exposed to their allergens.", "If I had to guess, either Bro or SiL was in charge of double checking for allergies and just didn't or didn't think it was a big deal, and now that it has caused a serious problem they're blaming OP rather than taking responsibility. \n\nThey poisoned you, they should be falling over themselves apologising to you.", "I can\u2019t think of a single reason you would be TA. Your SIL had an insanely disproportionate reaction \nNTA", "So my question is if this was an allergy that would have required an Epipen would they still call YOU TA here? No! So that means NTA. They should blame the chef for not communicating that your allergies was in one of the ingredients so you wouldn't have touched that item.", "NTA did she just totally flip the script with OPs brother, is he nuts, excuse the pun, but seriously OP didn't make a big deal about it and sorted herself out and was there for the ceremony. SIL is very sneaky.", "\"...saying i was an *ssh*le to told her during her wedding day that she was responsible of me being sick...\"\n\nWell she was responsible. You asked he twice and she said no. So either she didn't check, or she decided you weren't really sensitive to those foods and it didn't matter.\n\nNTA.", "I\u2019m so sorry that this happened to you and that Vic and your brother are blaming you for \u201cruining\u201d their wedding night.  They should be very grateful that your allergy didn\u2019t send you to the hospital.  And, they should be reading that caterer the riot act; messing with specifically stated allergens is no joke.  \n\nIn your position, I would have been very angry.  But, you behaved with grace and diplomacy.  NTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s not really her fault, it\u2019s the caterers. I can see why she was upset, but it sounds like her family is the ones making a big deal out of it", "NTA. You didn\u2019t purposefully spend the day on the toilet. You warned them about your allergies multiple times. It sounds pretty obvious that Vic didn\u2019t reach out to the caterers about what would be in the food. IF she did, then she needed to know the caterers messed up royally. Why is she so upset about what you said? Sounds like she is upset because she messed up. And if it was really the caterers fault, she should take it up with them. You did nothing wrong.", "from what I've heard with any kind of nut allergy its also important that the pots and other kitchen gear haven't been used for any nut containing meal\n\nfrom what happened i assume your SIL didn't ask the catering if you're fine but instead took a look at the menu and didn't see anything with nut/coconut in it\n\nNTA", "Nta, she probably didn't know and wasn't told about the coconut in the egg sauce (and may have made the mistake of assuming that nothing was named coconut so it wouldn't have it), so yes, she feels awful. And I'm sure you feel awful that she feels awful. But she asked. And you answered. That's really on her.", "YTA - It isn't the brides job to police your allergy.  You should never had asked her months before.  You should have asked the chef, the day of.  Like any other time you've gone out to a meal.", "I would say that you were a bit passive-aggressive here. I agree, you should have just made some excuse. I'm sure you had no real malice but maybe you do this kind of thing once too often. The wedding isn't about you, it's about them. Also, if a  minor ingredient in a dish can fell you like that, I think you need to be more proactive about your medical condition.", "If she told the caterers and they dropped the ball, that still doesn't require her to shoulder the blame.  Allergic reaction to coconut is extremely rare BTW. It may well have been something else.", "Jesus, I'm sorry, but could you please proof read what you write?

Because it sounds like she\u2019s upset/blaming herself and your brother is the angry one? If she was doing all the planning she\u2019s probably been stressed out for a while and that would make her reaction more likely- I would talk to her after the honeymoon (not your brother!) and see what she says.", "reminds me of another story i found on this subreddit\n\nsomeone was learning some decent cooking skills and wanted to show off at a dinnerparty they hosted, one of the guests brought along his new gf; noone knew she was severely allergic to seafood but something in the meal contained exactly that - but processed so well, you couldn't tell\n\nend of the story: the mysterious, uninvited gf ended up in a hospital and is now severely damaged for life, something about her brain, she's not able to live by herself anymore - and the guest that brought her along blamed the host for not giving a list of ingredients in the beginning", "Sounds likely. Besides, she was the one who asked. I hate to see how bad she would\u2019ve gone off if OP ended up needing an ambulance.", "This.

I have decided it\u2019s actually a benefit to be low or no contact with entitled narcissists who refuse to respect my life-threatening allergies, especially when they show their true colors by instigating it after poisoning me.", "yup this is my guess. either didn't realize that she had to talk to the caterer or forgot to do it in time and thought it would be fine. the appropriate thing to do if you forgot is to talk to the caterer immediately and if the menu isn't safe, tell your guest you screwed up\n\nbecause the embarrassment of you having forgotten is nothing to yanno, not fucking poisoning the person\n\nlots of people on this post jumped to \"doesn't believe in allergies\" or \"intentional poisoning\" but the reality is lots of people aren't *trying* to poison their friends and do understand allergies are real. and they still fuck up because they just don't take them as seriously as they need to. even if it's not an issue of cross-contamination, you need to be thorough\n\ncooking for someone with allergies means not only avoiding those specific ingredients but also checking the ingredients of any kind of prepared item that you use. when your catering or getting food from a restaurant you have to specifically make sure that those ingredients are not used anywhere in the dish  \n\nmost dishes only have a couple core ingredients listed on menus. you absolutely have to ask and you have to be specific then it is an allergy issue\n\nhonestly OP should have simply not trusted the bride and asked the caterer on her own anyway. it sucks but the unfortunate reality is that you cannot trust most people to handle allergies properly, even if they care", "u/VisiblePurchashj is a bot.

Maybe not did it on purpose, but definitely lied about checking, otherwise they\u2019d be mad at the caterers not the allergy sufferer. Too many people think allergy sufferers make it up and exaggerate, especially when the reaction is gut-based - they think \u2018boohoo you had a runny shit instead of a solid one, no big deal, don\u2019t care\u2019 instead of realising that some reactions will do what OP had.", "Given that I have heard people trying to deflect blame by saying \"But peanut oil isn\u2019t peanuts, it's *oil!*\" I wonder if there wasn't something of that sort going on with the caterer.", "He might forget thooo", "There is no roof that the bride intentionally tried to harm OP.

Add to that, most people will only react to the fruit but not the oil, and even then most won't react to derivatives.
