Second, throwaway for privacy\n\nI (24F) have a brother who is getting married to \u00abVictoria\u00bb (25F). Vic and I have a very good relationship.\n\nLast year, my brother proposed ! Vic took the lead for all the wedding preparation because she is taking a gap year between jobs. My brother support easily both of them and the wedding. So whenever we have questions about the wedding, She is the person we need to talk to.\n\nImportant background info: i\u2019m allergic to nuts and coconuts. I don't need an epipen, but I have massive d\\*\\*rrhea. Last time I had a reaction, I was so dehydrated I needed to go to the hospital.\n\nFor the wedding day, we have a caterer planned for an only-family brunch, then it\u2019s the ceremony, and then we have a celebration with all the guests.\n\nSo for the meals at the wedding, I texted 2 months in advance to Vic to ask if I would be able to eat (and told her my specific food allergies, in case she forgot). I told that if not, i would be able to bring my lunch and eat amongst everyone without any problem. It\u2019s something I do sometimes at big family gathering, because I don't expect everyone to be extra careful everytime for me. Vic told me that everything should be fine. 4 days before de the wedding, I texted again to be sure, and she said that the menu does not contain any of my allergens.\n\nWedding day; on the family brunch, I started to feel bad in my tummy. I privately asked to the chef if anything contained any nut/coconut and hold and behold: the sauce for the egg contained coconut. I excused myself and went back home (20 minutes away from the venue). After this\u2026 well you can imagine the toilet became my best friend. I passed the next 5 hours on the toilet. I texted my brother to excuse myself, that i won\u2019t be able to come to the ceremony and i would try to come to the celebration.\n\nSo around 8 hours after the brunch, I was capable to go back to the celebration. I did my wedding toast to my brother and after, Vic came to me and ask why I was absent from the ceremony. I told her that the brunch did contain coconut and I passed the whole day on the toilet, that i\u2019m glad i was able to come back to the ceremony and did not needed to go to the hospital. She then left back to my brother and spend the rest of the evening talking to guests.\n\nNext day, I\u2019ve received many many text from my brother, saying i was an \\*ssh\\*le to told her during her wedding day that she was responsible of me being sick and that I\u2019ve should told her some lies to make her happy. He told me she cried the whole wedding night about this. Since then, I've received texts from family members, friends, bridesmaids, who called me an \\*ss for ruining her wedding night. I'm starting to believe was an \\*ss and should have said to her a false reason explaining my absence during the ceremony because it ruined her evening. So.. AITA?

She couldn't be bothered to find out what was in the brunch foods, or to pass your food sensitivity information on to the caterers.

NTA.", "NTA\n\nWhat lie were you supposed to tell about why you missed the ceremony that wouldn't have made you seem like an AH? \n\nYou didn't blame her for it and you made it back for the celebration. Making it all about her seems rather extreme, she did nothing, the caterers did. Your family all jumping on your back is also rather extreme and unfair.", "Vic sounds dramatic. NTA.", "NTA. You told the truth and her reaction is hers to own. You can't control that. If she allowed your honest, yet kind, conversation to ruin her wedding night, that was her choice.", "NTA. You told the truth. Their neglected your allergies and made you sick. They should feel bad. What would have happened and you had an anaphylactic reaction?", "NTA I don't believe for a minute that she was crying and distraught. I think she's trying to turn it on you and make you the bad guy, like you ran off to avoid the ceremony for whatever reason.", "NTA. There\u2019s no evidence your SIL had not done her part to ensure an allergen free meal. These kinds of mistakes unfortunately just happen. \n\nIn hindsight, yeah just saying you were sick instead of pointing out the fuck up could have been graceful so the bride would not be troubled by feeling accountable. But acting imperfectly does not make you an asshole.\n\nBrother, family and friends are assholes for guilting you. I mean come on, it was your hardship and the truth of what happened.

They are just trying to put the blame on you so they don't look so bad themselves. \n\nYou did absolutely nothing wrong.", "NTA. It's not your fault she reacted the way she did, although personally, I would've asked the chef beforehand, not after eating, if nuts/coconuts were included in any of the food. Then, the whole situation would've been avoided.", "I'm going against the grain and saying NAH. It seems like your friend genuinely tried to accommodate your diet I made mistake, for which she feels very guilty. Her reaction is not your fault, you didn't do anything wrong by telling the truth, and you certainly are not an asshole. However I do not believe she is an asshole either, it seems like she tried to do right by you, and she hasn't reached out herself to blame you, just her jerk family.", "NTA.

You did nothing wrong.", "INFO have you confirmed that Vic told the caterers and asked them to cater to your allergy?\n\nThis sounds like both you and her did everything right and it was a mixup with the caterer\n\nI have a severe allergy and carry multiple epipens for easy access,  at my best friends wedding the caterers were told about the allergy and assured us there would be no cross contamination.

You *could* have come up with a quick white lie, or a more tactful way to say that the sauce had coconut. It seems like Vic did really take your allergies seriously and you both got tripped up by a sauce. The caterer's fault, rather than yours or Vic's.\n\nObviously you can't help your body's reactions. But your sister in law was super stressed on this huge day. There's a MASSIVE difference in approached between \"Well, actually, the food did have coconut\" (accusatory: you fucked up, you deliberately fucked up, you neglected my food allergies, this is your fault) and \"Hey, not to worry you at all, but I think the caterer made a mistake with the sauce. I'm totally fine though. You look amazing!\"", "This is a really good point.   \nRight now, SIL and my brother are low contact with me, but it is something i'm going to investigated further.", "But it doesn't sound to me like SIL was mad at OP? I think she might have felt guilty and that's why she cried, especially if they have a good relationship, which is fair. It's everyone else now being douchebags at OP.", "She may easily blamed herself for it... Because she was the one organizing the whole event and therefore, chose the menue... \n\nBut I didn't say explicitly that it was her fault or her mistake", "Because I've asked her 2 times beforehand and she assured me it was okay, I didn't asked the chef. Normally I do, but I've trusted her. The meals where chosen in advance, and the coconut allergen was not stated in the pamphlet we've received.", "Are you serious? She needed to know the truth. Mind you OP is allergic to nuts. Better be glad OP wasn\u2019t severely allergic, otherwise ambulances would have made a special appearance. Literally OP\u2019s family are the AH, SIL is slightly one too. She couldn\u2019t be bothered to make sure the caterers don\u2019t use nuts? Or make a special course for OP?", "Yes, but her reaction is not your responsibility. \n\nIn your shoes I would reach out to her and tell her you don\u2019t blame her at all. It sounds like she didn\u2019t ask for a list of ingredients and didn\u2019t realize the sauce had coconut. Or she only focused on the dinner menu. \n\nBTW, it\u2019s ridiculous your brother and family are blaming you. You shouldn\u2019t have to lie.", "I'm sorry, but why would you take her word for it and skip what you would normally do...? She wasn't the one making the food. \n\nAnd I don't know what the pamphlet is about, but sometimes super specific allergens aren't included on menus like peanut allergies would be. I have a blueberry allergy, I never get a warning for that and have to be vigilante on my own."]}
