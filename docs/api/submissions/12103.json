Thank you for those words", "I think you are right on the money.", "that is actually a good response... wish I could've think about that!", "Vic 100% fucked up and what kind of stupid bridesmaids send angry texts to the groom's sister for having the shits because the bride poisoned them?!?", "Ty fact that they are LC with OP with now does gone come across like she didn't actually take his allergies seriously. I don't believe at all she spend the night crying about it but are lying about it so no one in the family blames them for making a guest sick.", "Look how easily Vic isolated her groom from his sister, getting him to cut off a close and beloved family relationship. That is some deft manipulation right there. \n\nI sadly suspect Vic is an abuser, and she will continue to isolate him, until he alone bears her wrath.", "This could be the case, but allergies should be taken with utmost seriousness. I told my caterer about every POSSIBLE allergen of my guests. I even said \u201cI know this one sounds weird, but can you guarantee there isn\u2019t X ingredient in any of the food?\u201d Every and all allergies should be communicated to the caterer!", "100% Fairytale weddings do not exist. It\u2019s just show business with a big price tag.", "Yeah as far as \u201crelationship ruiners\u201d go, I would put \u201caccusing someone of intentionally poisoning you\u201d on that list.", "I would agree.", "As a person who also has the \u201cstuck on the toilet\u201d and not the \u201cairway closing going to die immediately\u201d kind of food allergies, I agree that people tend to take them less seriously. I\u2019m not sure that that\u2019s what happened here, but perhaps it is.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what else you could have done except possibly not taken the chance of eating anything catered at all\u2014but then you might have been seen as rude anyway. \n\nHoping everyone calms down and sees the light soon. You\u2019re definitely NTA", "I agree that knowing WHAT the mistake was is important. \n\nBased on her reaction and my gut I\u2019d place my bet that she didn\u2019t mention your allergies to the caterer. That she either didn\u2019t know the egg dish had coconut or just forgot and never put two and two together. Which would make it her fault, not the caterers, and mean she was crying because she realized she fucked up.", "You\u2019re mental, dude. Get off your computer or phone, go outside, and touch some grass. The Bride is TA because her reaction, but I doubt she was trying to poison OP. Not every situation is an episode of Game of Thrones. Odds are it was a honest mistake either by the Bride or the Catering company and that\u2019s all.", "Families with flying monkeys. I personally would block every single one of them. Admittedly, Vic could have told them you literally accused her of deliberately causing the problem, so they may not have the whole story. \n\nIf there is even one family member that you trust, give them your side of the story and ask them to distribute it to the jerks who are harassing you.", "I understand that and agree, but it\u2019s possible that her SIL didn\u2019t understand that it meant more than just not picking foods with the allergens. Regardless I think OP is NTA, but the assumption that this was deliberate on the SIL\u2019s part seemed absurd to me.", "Also:   Wtf kind of brunch has eggs with coconut \u201csauce\u201d?", "\"Not every situation is an episode of Game of Thrones\"\n\nWe need this as a banner here", "People react to things in lots of different ways.", "From OP's own comments it sounds like Vic might have had some kind of stress induced breakdown here. Plenty of other things could have precipitated her reaction, not the least of being taking on the lion's share of wedding planning in what sounds like a short time frame.\n\nI'm capable of many things, but large event planning is not one of them. I'm a huge introvert and I can see how the whole process could cause at least one or two inconsolable \"crying in the closet\" evenings.", "Have you been around adults with a lot on their plate? My friend broke down three times on her wedding day over the silly things that she'd never normally get upset over.  It's stressful. People aren't characters and they are complicated and imperfect. I could see both the bride and groom being stressed leading up to the wedding, the bride having a meltdown about this amidst the stress, and the groom being mad at the thing that caused his wife to stress. I'm not saying that that makes OP ta at all, or that this is a reasonable response, but it's not abnormal and doesn't imply guilt.", "OP should send gifs of the diarrhea scene in Bridesmaids.", "I imagine some weird Benedict.", "Do recall, English is not OPs first language. They could easily be in a location that has vastly different cuisine that what you're thinking of for a Brunch.", "Some people like to put coconut in everything!", "Yep, at least it was good"]}
