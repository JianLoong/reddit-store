No, why should you?", "NTA: but I\u2019m wondering if maybe it came off accusatory or like you blamed her? Even if you didn\u2019t mean for it to. Or maybe you were a little too graphic about spending 5 hours on the toilet? (As opposed to just saying, \u201cthe eggs had coconut and I was feeling sick\u2026\u201d)", "I can't think of any sauce for eggs that contains coconut. Even egg sauce that has nuts. Unless it was coconut ot nut oil- which is rare but not unheard of. \n\nUpshot, this caterer is horrible and with nut allergies being common- they should change their practices.\n\nNta", "NTA. You did nothing wrong by answering a direct question - openly and honestly.  SHE asked YOU. I think she felt guilty (which affirms she isn't a psycho) but it's not your responsibility to manage an adult woman's reaction to her own mistake. \n\nI think your brother feels bad that his bride was upset and is looking for someone to blame other than the bride. His anger is misdirected.", "NTA Every time you have a reaction it can become life threatening.", "NTA.  \n1. She is responsible.  \n2. She did hurt you, both physically and betraying your trust. \n3. You are the victim, not her.\n4. She should be apologizing to YOU. \n5. She is wrong to get others to harass you.. this is only hurting you more.\n6. They all owe you a massive apology.\n7. You checked in with her multiple times. She should feel bad.  It was her fault.", "NTA She had a very strong emotional reaction, she seems more upset than you. You could not have predicted her strange reaction.", "No, because what if you lied to her, and she got mad at you over said lie and caused an even bigger problem within your family?", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02wtf. What a fucking weirdo. \n\nNTA.", ">maybe the chef thought a little coconut in the egg dish wasn't that bad...\n\nThere is a good chance a caterer would lose any of their food safety certs if they did that, unless the caterer was the brides aunt and not an actual business it's very unlikely they would endanger their business like that.", "The fact that the rest of the family is turning on OP makes me think SIL told them a slightly altered version of the story to make herself the victim.", "They are really blaming you for getting sick? It\u2019s a really weird reaction. Sil then went around and told others you blamed her for your illness. I\u2019m in agreement with another commenter that she overreacted as a form of damage control. She is willing to ruin your relationships with various family members to keep from facing blame.", "Do you think it was a catering error or that she lied to you?", "They are doing you a favor to go low contact with you. You thought you got along with SIL, but obviously, she didn't think well of you (or at all).", "Honestly, I\u2019m horrified by your family\u2019s reaction.  They should be worried about you. They should be supporting you.  This is SIL\u2019s mistake.  To go no contact over their own mistake, makes no sense.", "Don't you know allergies aren't real? /s", "You were very kind and considerate in the way you've conducted yourself about the whole thing. \n\nThem going LC with you is inappropriate. If anything they should be furious at the caterers, not you. You can't control their reactions: you did your best to manage it respectfully and that's the most you can do.", "Whether she did it on purpose or by accident, you\u2019re still not at fault.  She still owes you an apology and needs to get everyone else to apologize for harassing you.  You\u2019ve done nothing wrong.  If anything, I\u2019m impressed you still went back.", " \n\nHe's an ass for not making sure the allergic person didn't have the allergen when he asked too many times.", "\"She didn't tell me she was allergic and then yelled at me until I cried because they used coconut\"", "This scenario needs to be considered.  A normal person would seriously be somewhat  contrite.  And yes, consult with the caterer on what went wrong where a family member could have ended up in the hospital.\n\nThe bride and everyone else are The Ones who have gone nuclear, way too defensive.  They know they f\u00ae^ked up.", "I think what the most likely is that someone (either it was the SIL or caterers) didn't realize that there was coconut in the egg. Whether it is due to your SIL or caterers forgetting is unknown. Sometimes what happens is that if the caterer gets too busy, they outsource things and did not tell the outside vendor about the allergy. SIL is upset because either she forgot to tell the caterer or the caterer screwed up and ruined her perfect day because you were noticeably absent. Or she could just really care about you and is feeling guilty that this has happened and doesn't know how to apologize.", "Redditors live in a strange, strange world.", "I was a bridesmaid at my friend's wedding and the bride absolutely told the venue I was coeliac. There was a bread roll on everyone's assigned seat at the venue and when I asked if it was gf (I didn't eat it, but assumed it was and wanted to double check) the staff told me \"no.\" Caterers mess up sometimes. Depending upon finding out if the bride did contact the caterers about your allergy, NAH (except the caterers). If she didn't than NTA.", "This is NOT how you take responsibility - the bride was the AH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe had TWO reasonable options:\n\n* Either to make SURE\n* Or to tell OP: sorry, I could not ensure that there would be no coconut etc. in it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe chose to be an AH, and that hurt OP.", "If SIL had told the caterer \"one of the guests is allergic to coconut, do not use any coconut\" then:\n\n1) why is she mad at OP when it would be the caterer's error\n\n2) why did the chef immediately say oh yes, there's coconut in the sauce - if they had explicitly been told no coconut?\n\nNo, SIL either didn't inform them or else the caterer's screwed up and didn't inform the chef.", "Well, hour upon hour in the bathroom because someone lied about allergens is quite nuclear.", "The bride is angry because now all know that HER BEHAVIOR made someone who made the error of trusting her get hurt.", "Innocent people don\u2019t react like she did.", "I agree. The bride should have apologized and then figured out what happened. I just don't think that it was deliberate if they truly had a good relationship."]}
