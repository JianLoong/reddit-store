As a 300 lb guy I would never get a massage simply due to the fact that I wouldn't want to subject someone - paid or not - to have to massage me. It's disgusting, no one wants to massage a fat human.

This person most likely was seeking relief and relaxation above all else, and you probably could\u2019ve provided that without a table.", "I would say yes. She was under the weight limit no matter what and it is quite dehumanizing and embarrassing to weigh somebody before they get something non-medical done. Being fat does not mean she didn\u2019t deserve the same treatment as her friends, and if you don\u2019t have the accommodations for bigger people, make it written somewhere so bigger people can take their business elsewhere to somebody more accommodating.", "NTA.

Whether or not you are the AH comes down to HOW you communicated it, I would say (ETA: the way you phrased the question here suggests you probably were an AH about it, though) \n\nThat said, if she was under the table's capacity, why couldn't you give her a massage?

Client could have been very seriously injured.", "she was only 13kg under the limit bro like I wouldn\u2019t risk that either", "Why do you assume she did this in an embarassing way? OP said she was polite. She wasn't being cruel, she was being cautios over a fact (that she also checked to be sure) that the client was simply too heavy.\n\nAlso, tables are always going to have a weight limit, no material is indestructible or completely resistant to weight, and if it's meant to have humans on top of it, 400+ pounds is a very reasonable limit, not a lot of people weight that much. It's unfortunate, but it isn't OP's fault. If the table had broken or the client had gotten injured, it would be on her. Nothing wrong with being careful.", "Yeah, but that's not how weight and a pressure of massage works...", "A full 30+ lbs of pressure? For a massage? I doubt it. \n\nOP also didn\u2019t have to weigh the customer like that and then deny her *because of her weight in front of her group of friends*. She KNOWS she\u2019s the fat friend. to go with a group of friends somewhere and to more or less be told \u201cyou\u2019re the only one who can\u2019t do this, because you\u2019re fat, let me see just how fat you are please step on the scale, see you\u2019re too fat, all your friends who are here watching this happen can do this, but you? No you can\u2019t. Because you\u2019re fat\u201d. It\u2019s dehumanizing.", "How so? What could be wrong that they would get up to that number?", "Info: does your table not list static weight and working weight separately?\n\nEdit sorry this was meant to be a top-level comment to OP, not a reply", "As Don Draper said  \"THAT'S WHAT THE MONEY'S FOR!\"", "I think you should add info in an edit so people don\u2019t just go \u201cBut SHe WaS unDer tHe weIghT caPAciTy\u201d\u201d", "I would seek clarification. There should be nothing case by case about it. It should just be a clear blanket policy with a specific number. \n\nIn fact, your boss hasn't done their job if you haven't been given a weight limit, especially now that the issue has actually come up, and that limit has to be made known to customers when they're making an appointment. \n\nLook at it this way: With no policy, you're always at fault for the outcome. The company has pushed that onto you. This time it was fine, but what if this person wrote a scathing review about feeling fat shamed? What if that review went viral? Management probably would not have taken your side. You'd be fired so they looked like they handled it, and that is incredibly unfair to you.", "So she wasn\u2019t under the weight limit no matter what.", "I get that but the lady didn\u2019t even have bad intent she said it nicely and didn\u2019t have the intention of humiliating her", "The weight capacity was 495lbs, and the masseuse has to apply pressure onto the client as part of the massage. It\u2019s a safety issue. \n\nPeople who are >400lbs exist, but are still not common. There\u2019s no way the masseuse would\u2019ve known ahead of time that one of their prospective clients was over 400lbs. \n\nIMO, if you know that there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll need specific accommodations for whatever you\u2019re doing or wherever you\u2019re going, then it\u2019s your responsibility to seek out the information on whether you can be accommodated. It\u2019s unfair to expect that everyone can meet your specific needs all the time. \n\nThis person tried to offer other services to this person but they refused.\n\nWhat if they did do the massage and the table broke from underneath them? Then they both risk injury, wouldn\u2019t that be a dehumanizing situation as well?\n\nIt\u2019s a lose-lose situation, you\u2019re damn if you do and damned if you don\u2019t. The masseuse didn\u2019t want to endanger their client and offered alternatives. Sure it\u2019s not ideal but sometimes all they can offer is the best that can be done.", "Unfortunately no as we don't offer that as the spa's main focus is cosmetic related treatments.", "They account for a weight limit, they state the weight limit. They couldn't possibly guess how much pressure an individual masseuse would apply. Common sense.", "Have you not ever gave or received a massage? What do you do exactly just caress the skin?", "Nowhere in the post did it say he weighed her in front of her friends. You are making an assumption and putting words in his mouth.", "i\u2019m a fat person, and the fat friend. although op shouldn\u2019t have done any of this publicly at all, she was in her rights to let go of this customer. this was a safety risk for her and the customer and nothing more.", "I put a heck-of-a-lot more than 30 lbs of pressure on people during a massage. Not only pressure from my weight, but from rocking motions as well. \n\nDo you know those tables fold in the center so as to be portable? Thin metal cables hold the table open while in use. If the table buckled under a heavy weight during use, the client would be in great danger of severe injury. I have insurance, but don't really want to go through the process of being sued by a client. I don't want to know I hurt or paralyzed someone, or have the reputation of having hurt someone. \n\nI have my business to protect. I have the right to refuse to take on any client if I deem it unsafe for either of us. OP offered this client other services, so they tried their best. (I assume they tried a floor-style massage like in Thai Massage technique, or something similar.) He remained professional and polite. It's an unfortunate situation, but nothing can be done about it.", "I understand that as well for sure. It\u2019s just something that is generally not comfortable for many individuals and it needs to be tread on lightly. It\u2019s validly embarrassing and humiliating to people who suffer from eating disorders as well as just being bigger.", "Damn. Did you ask her how much she weighed or just right on the scale? Bc pulling her off to the side and saying hey I don\u2019t want to offend but for your safety I need to ask how much you weigh our tables have a limit, they aren\u2019t the best, and the last thing either of want today is a table malfunction. She tells you a number and you make your best judgement relative to that. Unless everyone gets weighed. Honestly should probably be a disclaimer on the check in forms after this.", "This is a great response"]}
