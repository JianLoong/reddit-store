It fucked up my arms and I had to quit. It was a bummer esp cause it was good money and helping people fell better is always a good feeling. And it was also before mom or wife got sick, and I was in my 20s so I could handle a full time job and full time school then.\n\nI\u2019ve also been a Family Preservationist, and a few other cool/unique jobs. Part of being an artist is finding the weird jobs that pay enough and also give you enough time to make art, so you end up following some unexpected paths. I\u2019m actually really lucky right now that art is paying most the bills, but some day I\u2019ll probably need to get another weird rando job to plug up the holes. \n\nPlus (sorry I am rambling now haha) you\u2019d be surprised how often those jobs lead into each other.

Her genetics are quite different from mine, whereas I can eat 4 doughnuts and still want another one, her brain tells her half a doughnut is plenty and won't allow her to eat more than that. Semaglutide peptide is currently my savior and helping my brain to stop demanding excessive amounts.", "100% this.  Personal injury attorneys would be all over it.", "\u201cShe tells you a number and you make your nest judgment.\u201d  \n\nWe\u2019re talking about literally 465 pounds of weight, potentially falling onto the body of someone who can\u2019t work if they\u2019re physically injured.  \n\nHe was supposed to take that risk based on someone who is probably extremely embarrassed, telling him her weight when she weighs too much to be weird buy a standard bathroom scale, or even a standard doctors office scale?  \n\nYea, fuck no.  It\u2019s a shitty situation, I feel really badly for that woman, but he doesn\u2019t need to risk his physical health or his livelihood so that she can get a massage.", "If there's anything I learned while going through my weightloss several years ago, people in general are horrible at estimating weight once a certain level of obesity is reached. Very few people can tell the difference between 275lbs and 325lbs. And as the weight increases, the visual estimate gets even more inaccurate. I would postulate that most people couldn't eyeball 400lbs and 500lbs without side by side comparisons.\n\nIt wasn't until I got down to about 225lbs when every 10lbs lost was noticeable. But that first 50lbs lost, nobody really noticed.", "Horrifying. So sorry for that patient and for everyone who was in the room.", "You are not counting the weight of the pressure from the massage. When I go in for a massage, I come out with bruises due to the person giving it releasing tense points. You have to consider their weight on you as well. Plus you have the consider then force of the person moving on top of the bed. This isn't an exact science.", "I think the static weight limit basically says that it can handle being under 2000lbs when stored or during moving. But these tables have a bunch of mechanisms in them to move up and down so the mechanisms can't hold over 500lbs when extended in any way.", "So basically you are telling us the ' fat people go to the vet for a medical check' thing is an urban myth!\n\nFrankly your comment makes a lot of sense the moment I read it. I saw a TV docu about a zoo, where they simply did not do certain checks on the bigger animals because of size restrictions.\n\nSadly I had not yet put 2 and 2 together and still thought the probable myth was true.", ">I have put a dolphin in a CT. And a Lion.\n\nTechnically wouldn't any diagnostic of a lion be considered a CAT scan?\n\nThanks folks, I'll be here all week. Don't forget to tip your waitress!!"]}
