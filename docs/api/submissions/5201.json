For the sake of ethics and morality, seriously, do it.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t think that this is necessarily an AITA situation we have going on here: no one would know that it was you, and if they do, there\u2019s not much they could do about it.\n\nObviously, you should tell. Yeah, they might see you as TA, but who cares what they think? It is the consequence of their actions. If you\u2019re worried about how much grief you\u2019ll cause them, just try to think about the good things that will come from you informing the school:\n\n1. The professor will lose their job, which directly results in them no longer being able to prey on students (at least at this school, unless they\u2019re completely blacklisted, which would be ideal)\n\n2. The professor\u2019s spouse would find out the truth and *hopefully* leave them to find someone who will treat them better. It saves from many many more years to come of lies and secrets since everything will come to the surface.\n\n3. The scholarship might go to someone who *actually* deserves it. Though I am curious as to why you say they would be unable to ever further their education again.\n\n4. An investigation would be started on the professor and the school would find out about any past relations they\u2019ve had with other students, and maybe even start to investigate other professors that they deem suspicious.\n\nSo I say go for it, but again, I don\u2019t think this is an AITA situation. Yes, you are worried about ruining their lives, it\u2019s very sweet of you, but you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about doing the right thing because it is the consequence of their own actions.

NTA for doing so. I don't understand why some people are so afraid of being silent, but I would let them know you want protections for retaliation. The scholarship thing is BS. The infidelity is BS.

Just by accusing these people can ruin their lives as in our world now, facts don\u2019t matter.\n\nIs this situation hurting you in anyway or are you just morally outraged?  Not that I am saying that either is invalid if there really is misconduct, but examine your motives first as they could be skewing the way you are reading what you see.\n\nAlso, I am not sure what country you are in, but make sure you understand the rules of what you are accusing.

Professors take care of each other and chances are your roommate will get eaten up and spit out of the system.

Most especially for your room mate. \n\nIt is wrong for the professor to be having a sexual relationship with a student. Period. You can report this anonymously, and you can do so without using your roommate\u2019s name. Hopefully, this will be enough to open an investigation, and scare the living shit out of the professor. The goal here would be for him to stop dating students. \n\nAs for the scholarship, are you aware of how this is awarded? What the criteria is? Who actually awards the scholarship and if the prof does anything other than provide a recommendation? Are you saying your roommate would not get this scholarship at all otherwise?\n\nThis is a tricky situation. I don\u2019t have any issues with this prof being called out and punished etc. I am terribly concerned about your room mate. \n\nThink about your own motivations. What reporting would serve. Figure out all possible options first. \n\nIf you have a student union, this would be a good time to head over and get some advice.", "Well you can report her and the professor for having an affair and how the professor broke the rules by extending submission time for her and etc. But as for scholarship it's better not to report about it because you don't have any substantial proof for it but if you have then you can go ahead. \n\nAnd as for how your report may ruin her and professor life it depends. But first make sure whether she knows that the professor is married or not because he may have lied to her ( a possibility) but be careful about it. You don't have to carry the burden of ruining someone's life because this is all the result of their own actions. If they had not done what they did then I would also have no reason or need to report their actions.", "Go for it. \n\nThe improper relationship is none of your business, imho.

However, a student brought into a program of study generally needs more support than that and that additional $ is collectively doled out. Some depts are poor enough that no prof can afford to pull someone in unilaterally at all, though this is more common in humanities and behavioral/applied science than biotech/engineering. There may be some way that people can pull students in on FTEs but it\u2019s not something I\u2019m aware of.", "that\u2019s what i\u2019m saying- it makes more sense to report them for the relationship than academic misconduct because if they\u2019re in a relationship then the school can see the academic effects.

Professor is exhibiting predatory behavior, and will likely continue this behavior with the next young thing after your roommate moves on. While your roommate is a consenting adult, there are extremely unbalanced power dynamics at play\u2026which is why there are rules against this kind of thing!! But let me clarify\u2026.the rules can be murky. Depending on the university, relationships between faculty and students aren\u2019t always expressly forbidden, but if there is any supervisory role involved, they can be required to disclose the relationship to avoid blatant conflict of interest (supervisory role = student is in their class or their direct employee). Since professor is married, I doubt they\u2019ve disclosed anything! Someone commented to report  it to the Title IX office, and it\u2019s the professor you\u2019re reporting for improper relationship with a student, not the roommate for academic misconduct\u2026and that is correct. Again, this is predatory behavior by the professor and it won\u2019t stop unless he is stopped. For those going on about \u2018don\u2019t ruin lives\u2019\u2026that\u2019s how predatory behavior festers in academia, everyone turning a blind eye to the bullshit.

Accusations, even when based up by decades of proof and hundreds of witnesses, only seem to ruin the lives of the accusers.", "Something very wrong is happening here, and OP has the chance to do something about it", "If the professor threatened to ruin her career or fail her unless she slept with him that would be one thing but we have no indication that that happened here. Merely having the possibility to do something bad is not the same as actually threatening to do it, if it were basically all interactions ever would be considered coercion because anyone you meet could secretly be concealing a weapon that they might use against you if you don't do what they want. But that's an absurd standard, it doesn't become Coercion until there's an actual threat.\n\n\nPlus, in this situation, we don't even know if the professor started it. Maybe the student came on to him.", "If she ends the relationship she might lose her scholarship, but she never deserved the scholarship in the first place and it was her decision to sleep with someone to get it unfairly. She is in no way a victim.", "My university, at least when I finished grad school a few years ago, had no rules against this type of relationship between professors and graduate students, whereas the professor would be fired for a relationship with an undergraduate. It\u2019s possible not much will happen to either of them", "I guess recording her talking about the relationship is unethical, but then so is the relationship", "She doesn\u2019t fucking know. It\u2019s not her job to know, it\u2019s his. \n\nHow many times have young women feared rejecting inappropriate advances because they don\u2019t want to suffer career or social consequences? How much of work place misconduct between a superior man and a junior woman is because someone in a position that could be coerced couldn\u2019t say no? \n\nWhen is it ever the fault of a teenage girl when an older man in the position of not only influencing but directly deciding their grades, their recommendations letters, their academic future makes sexual advances and they didn\u2019t want a refusal to affect their future?", "Nope. Universities don't blame students who are in relationships with professors. The ethical (and in some cases, legal) violation is on the professor, who is older, more powerful, and should fucking know better.", "Think of it this way. You pull $20 out of the ATM, it's dark and you're alone. A very large and imposing dude taps you on the shoulder and nicely suggests it would be a great idea if you handed over that $20. You have the sense to recognize this could potentially go very badly for you if you tell him to piss off. You hand over the $20. Is it robbery? Nope, you voluntarily handed over the money, you weren't directly threatened. He asked nicely, you gave him the money. But did you really feel you had the option to safely say no? Probably not. \n\nThis is exactly why there are rules against professors having relationships with their students at most universities. The implied built in threat of tanking their career is enough to make consent questionable at best. It happens, but that doesn't make it ok.", "When there\u2019s a clear power dynamic issue like teacher student a teacher didn\u2019t even have to threaten them. It\u2019s fair that a student would think: If I say no what will they do to me? I need this class. \n\nThat alone is enough for it to be coercive and it\u2019s why schools don\u2019t (generally) allow student/teacher relationships, it\u2019s a tricky legal loophole.", "You don't know they didn't deserve the scholarship though, the professor/mentor manipulated the situation to withhold it if they didn't give the professor sex but that's not proof the student couldn't have gotten the scholarship if the professor had been professional from the start.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe student is being victimized and is at risk of losing their career if they withhold sex from a mentor.", "But are you talking about professors and graduate students all being allowed to fuck, or only professors and graduate students who aren't in (for lack of a better term) direct report lines? There's a difference between Prof. Jane Doe from the English department dating graduate student from the maths department John Smith, and Professor Jane Doe who is the PhD advisor of John Smith dating graduate student John Smith.", "You don\u2019t end victimization by removing autonomy from the victim. You victimize them again, in a different way. \n\nIf they were honestly concerned about their roommate being a victim, they would have had a conversation. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that professor X is over here a lot. I\u2019m concerned that you\u2019re being taken advantage of. Is there anything you want to talk about?\u201d You don\u2019t go directly to admin and claim \u201cacademic misconduct\u201d. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s sexual misconduct on the part of the professor.", "Genuine question: assuming that the student would not get penalized for this affair by the university due to the power imbalance, wouldn't it still come back to hurt them to get some sort of license, depending on the graduate level program they're in? I know that several programs that offer a license to be able to do whatever job it is with their graduate level credentials has a \"character and fitness\" portion of the process. Wouldn't their involvement in this scenario question their credibility or their reputation in some way?", "Ok, first of all, you people need to keep in mind that I'm neither OP nor OP's roommate...\n\nSecond of all, populism aside, you should keep in mind that I'm just a girl in a big world (meaning, I can only tell you how rules are in my country, and in most of EU countries).\n\nI believe teenagers years go from 13 up to 19.. But I happen to be way over 19 yo..\n\nThat way of thinking keeps me wondering: Do young adults know what they're up to, or are they too young when being prosecuted as adults when there's a mass shooting involved..?? Also, at what time do you people consider it is OK to go ahead a blame a teenager for an adult crime but not taking the parents accountable..?  Don't get me wrong, but they're the ones in charge of the kids education at home (big news!! ). \n\nYou guys really need to reflect on what 'the land of the free' really means, cause over the years you've become something nobody wants to talk about, but everybody dislikes.", "I believe those must be the rules in your county, sweetheart.. Not at everybody else's..\n\nAt what point do we agree that cultural/educational differences do make a difference??\n\nPeriod.", "This is such a wonderful analogy for coerced consent!", "Bums ask me for money all the time, I just say no and move on.", "This line of reasoning pretty quickly leads you to concluding that all or almost sex is nonconsensual. Most sex is initiated when a man and a woman are alone and most men are much physically stronger than most women. The man could easily hurt the woman if she refuses so by your logic she is being forced even if he never threatens anything. This is clearly an absurd conclusion. A threat that is never made is not a threat.", "Where I was (and again as of 7 years ago), the professor could be in a relationship and still advise the student doing the PhD. If the professor is the one who awarded the scholarship to the student (or even played a role in choosing the winner) without disclosing the relationship, that would be enough for termination anywhere. For the record, I do not disagree with you at all and  not trying to imply that the professor is not an AH who should be fired.", "Your last sentence is exactly right and all that matters. It needs to be reported immediately and the roommate does not need to be consulted about it, because it\u2019s sexual misconduct regardless of her feelings about it", "Being the victim of sexual harassment shouldn't have an impact on the student officially unless their work wasn't up to par in some material way. That said, people are horrid and the stink of this likely would follow the student. At least the student would be the last one. Professors who do this don't do it just once in my experience (worked in academia most of my career).", "How does it change the story? Student sleeping with professor for favors: that\u2019s the story no matter what the sex or gender of anyone involved.", " literally *made up* pronouns would be better (edit: lol \"pronounds\")\n\nuse \"shplim\" and \"splher\" for all I care just make that shit READABLE", "Gotcha! Thank you for clarifying this!!", "I agree, but that doesn't change the fact that people will view this differently. \n\nLike how any time a male teacher has sex with a student it's called rape in the news, but when it's a female teacher having sex with a student it's never referred to as such.", "The only actual facts we have that aren\u2019t colored by OP\u2019s perception are the fact that a sexual relationship exists and that the student has gotten extensions on their assignments. We know nothing else that isn\u2019t implied by the messenger, I think those are really shitty reasons to wade into this potential shit show.", "There is one fact that won't get \"coloured by OP's perception\" regardless of academic background - professor is cheating on his wife.\n\nYou were talking about destroying 2 lives before while forgeting that this relationship is already destroying another life. His wife's. If professor has kids - even more than one life is being destroyed. \n\nHis wife deserves better."]}
