For the sake of ethics and morality, seriously, do it.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t think that this is necessarily an AITA situation we have going on here: no one would know that it was you, and if they do, there\u2019s not much they could do about it.\n\nObviously, you should tell. Yeah, they might see you as TA, but who cares what they think? It is the consequence of their actions. If you\u2019re worried about how much grief you\u2019ll cause them, just try to think about the good things that will come from you informing the school:\n\n1. The professor will lose their job, which directly results in them no longer being able to prey on students (at least at this school, unless they\u2019re completely blacklisted, which would be ideal)\n\n2. The professor\u2019s spouse would find out the truth and *hopefully* leave them to find someone who will treat them better. It saves from many many more years to come of lies and secrets since everything will come to the surface.\n\n3. The scholarship might go to someone who *actually* deserves it. Though I am curious as to why you say they would be unable to ever further their education again.\n\n4. An investigation would be started on the professor and the school would find out about any past relations they\u2019ve had with other students, and maybe even start to investigate other professors that they deem suspicious.\n\nSo I say go for it, but again, I don\u2019t think this is an AITA situation. Yes, you are worried about ruining their lives, it\u2019s very sweet of you, but you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about doing the right thing because it is the consequence of their own actions.

NTA for doing so. I don't understand why some people are so afraid of being silent, but I would let them know you want protections for retaliation. The scholarship thing is BS. The infidelity is BS.

Just by accusing these people can ruin their lives as in our world now, facts don\u2019t matter.\n\nIs this situation hurting you in anyway or are you just morally outraged?  Not that I am saying that either is invalid if there really is misconduct, but examine your motives first as they could be skewing the way you are reading what you see.\n\nAlso, I am not sure what country you are in, but make sure you understand the rules of what you are accusing.

Professors take care of each other and chances are your roommate will get eaten up and spit out of the system.

Most especially for your room mate. \n\nIt is wrong for the professor to be having a sexual relationship with a student. Period. You can report this anonymously, and you can do so without using your roommate\u2019s name. Hopefully, this will be enough to open an investigation, and scare the living shit out of the professor. The goal here would be for him to stop dating students. \n\nAs for the scholarship, are you aware of how this is awarded? What the criteria is? Who actually awards the scholarship and if the prof does anything other than provide a recommendation? Are you saying your roommate would not get this scholarship at all otherwise?\n\nThis is a tricky situation. I don\u2019t have any issues with this prof being called out and punished etc. I am terribly concerned about your room mate. \n\nThink about your own motivations. What reporting would serve. Figure out all possible options first. \n\nIf you have a student union, this would be a good time to head over and get some advice.", "Well you can report her and the professor for having an affair and how the professor broke the rules by extending submission time for her and etc. But as for scholarship it's better not to report about it because you don't have any substantial proof for it but if you have then you can go ahead. \n\nAnd as for how your report may ruin her and professor life it depends. But first make sure whether she knows that the professor is married or not because he may have lied to her ( a possibility) but be careful about it. You don't have to carry the burden of ruining someone's life because this is all the result of their own actions. If they had not done what they did then I would also have no reason or need to report their actions.", "Go for it. \n\nThe improper relationship is none of your business, imho.

However, a student brought into a program of study generally needs more support than that and that additional $ is collectively doled out. Some depts are poor enough that no prof can afford to pull someone in unilaterally at all, though this is more common in humanities and behavioral/applied science than biotech/engineering.

Professor is exhibiting predatory behavior, and will likely continue this behavior with the next young thing after your roommate moves on. While your roommate is a consenting adult, there are extremely unbalanced power dynamics at play\u2026which is why there are rules against this kind of thing!! But let me clarify\u2026.the rules can be murky. Depending on the university, relationships between faculty and students aren\u2019t always expressly forbidden, but if there is any supervisory role involved, they can be required to disclose the relationship to avoid blatant conflict of interest (supervisory role = student is in their class or their direct employee). Since professor is married, I doubt they\u2019ve disclosed anything! Someone commented to report  it to the Title IX office, and it\u2019s the professor you\u2019re reporting for improper relationship with a student, not the roommate for academic misconduct\u2026and that is correct. Again, this is predatory behavior by the professor and it won\u2019t stop unless he is stopped. For those going on about \u2018don\u2019t ruin lives\u2019\u2026that\u2019s how predatory behavior festers in academia, everyone turning a blind eye to the bullshit.

State dates and time and location.", "We also do not know the \"proof\" that OP claims to have.\nHearsay and gossip is not proof.

Which is well kind of pointed out by Grey's Anatomy. A mid-20s girl meets a mid-30s guy in a bar. They hook up. Nothing untoward, but then he's her attending. College is not as old as residency but everyone is at least an adult and so the relationship passes the legal test unless a pattern of abuse of power can be shown. Even then, not much would get done.\n\nThe fellowship OP is talking about seems like a pretty normal thing for a grad student. There's the hard to prove thing about if she deserved it or if there was someone more deserving. There's a conflict of interest in his recommendation to the fellowship and admissions committee. But that isn't unequivocal evidence that the fellowship isn't deserved. There is usually a committee too so he would have had to make a case to the committee.\n\nProbably should file a complaint still, if only to get people to steer away from him.

Sorry I wouldn't believe you based on just this.", "I agree. She has enough proof to report that an inappropriate relationship is happening. Leave the suspicions of academic privileges out of it.

If there is any fall out, it's because of his decision. You (the general you- in this case the professor) don't just wind up in bed with a student- it's a result of little decisions that you made along the way. You made decisions with out thinking of the possible consequences. You made the decision to meet with the office door closed- you could have met with the door open when other people were there. You made the decision to kiss her- you could have not gotten to close. At any point along the way, you could have made a different choice.", "Funny, because I live in Baltimore, lol. \n\nAlso.

I guessed given the username. :) I\u2019m here too. \n\nYeah I don\u2019t really know what inspires downvotes on this sub.

Can you cite a policy that would blame the student?", "I work in academia and this kind of response is usually a mixture of jealousy, immaturity and good old misogyny. Jealous they aren't getting similar favours, immaturity meaning they don't understand the power imbalance and highly inappropriate dynamics, and misogyny because women still get blamed for having sex (even by other women). \n\nOP should report this. Interestingly while she see potentially severe consequences for her housemate (some of which are more realistic than others) she sees that as a just punishment for her friend rather than those outcomes being the exact reason a relationship of this nature is so exploitative.

You do not want to anger your thesis advisor. What does that mean when they're pushing your boundaries while having sex? What does that mean if you want to break up with them? A relationship may feel consensual but with that kind of power dynamic consent is near impossible. Do not ever put yourself in that situation.
