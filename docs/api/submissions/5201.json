For the sake of ethics and morality, seriously, do it.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t think that this is necessarily an AITA situation we have going on here: no one would know that it was you, and if they do, there\u2019s not much they could do about it.\n\nObviously, you should tell. Yeah, they might see you as TA, but who cares what they think? It is the consequence of their actions. If you\u2019re worried about how much grief you\u2019ll cause them, just try to think about the good things that will come from you informing the school:\n\n1. The professor will lose their job, which directly results in them no longer being able to prey on students (at least at this school, unless they\u2019re completely blacklisted, which would be ideal)\n\n2. The professor\u2019s spouse would find out the truth and *hopefully* leave them to find someone who will treat them better. It saves from many many more years to come of lies and secrets since everything will come to the surface.\n\n3. The scholarship might go to someone who *actually* deserves it. Though I am curious as to why you say they would be unable to ever further their education again.\n\n4. An investigation would be started on the professor and the school would find out about any past relations they\u2019ve had with other students, and maybe even start to investigate other professors that they deem suspicious.\n\nSo I say go for it, but again, I don\u2019t think this is an AITA situation. Yes, you are worried about ruining their lives, it\u2019s very sweet of you, but you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about doing the right thing because it is the consequence of their own actions.

NTA for doing so. I don't understand why some people are so afraid of being silent, but I would let them know you want protections for retaliation. The scholarship thing is BS. The infidelity is BS.

Just by accusing these people can ruin their lives as in our world now, facts don\u2019t matter.\n\nIs this situation hurting you in anyway or are you just morally outraged?  Not that I am saying that either is invalid if there really is misconduct, but examine your motives first as they could be skewing the way you are reading what you see.\n\nAlso, I am not sure what country you are in, but make sure you understand the rules of what you are accusing.

You can report this anonymously, and you can do so without using your roommate\u2019s name. Hopefully, this will be enough to open an investigation, and scare the living shit out of the professor. The goal here would be for him to stop dating students. \n\nAs for the scholarship, are you aware of how this is awarded? What the criteria is? Who actually awards the scholarship and if the prof does anything other than provide a recommendation? Are you saying your roommate would not get this scholarship at all otherwise?\n\nThis is a tricky situation. I don\u2019t have any issues with this prof being called out and punished etc. I am terribly concerned about your room mate. \n\nThink about your own motivations. What reporting would serve. Figure out all possible options first. \n\nIf you have a student union, this would be a good time to head over and get some advice.", "Well you can report her and the professor for having an affair and how the professor broke the rules by extending submission time for her and etc. But as for scholarship it's better not to report about it because you don't have any substantial proof for it but if you have then you can go ahead. \n\nAnd as for how your report may ruin her and professor life it depends. But first make sure whether she knows that the professor is married or not because he may have lied to her ( a possibility) but be careful about it. You don't have to carry the burden of ruining someone's life because this is all the result of their own actions.

However, a student brought into a program of study generally needs more support than that and that additional $ is collectively doled out. Some depts are poor enough that no prof can afford to pull someone in unilaterally at all, though this is more common in humanities and behavioral/applied science than biotech/engineering.

Professor is exhibiting predatory behavior, and will likely continue this behavior with the next young thing after your roommate moves on. While your roommate is a consenting adult, there are extremely unbalanced power dynamics at play\u2026which is why there are rules against this kind of thing!! But let me clarify\u2026.the rules can be murky. Depending on the university, relationships between faculty and students aren\u2019t always expressly forbidden, but if there is any supervisory role involved, they can be required to disclose the relationship to avoid blatant conflict of interest (supervisory role = student is in their class or their direct employee). Since professor is married, I doubt they\u2019ve disclosed anything! Someone commented to report  it to the Title IX office, and it\u2019s the professor you\u2019re reporting for improper relationship with a student, not the roommate for academic misconduct\u2026and that is correct. Again, this is predatory behavior by the professor and it won\u2019t stop unless he is stopped. For those going on about \u2018don\u2019t ruin lives\u2019\u2026that\u2019s how predatory behavior festers in academia, everyone turning a blind eye to the bullshit.

That\u2019s impressive\u2026there must be some merit there, you don\u2019t end up on that trajectory solely by sleeping with one guy for a few months. \n\nYou could also go to the Title IX office and ask about the situation without making an official report.

I think you are making some assumptions about the \"academic misconduct\" portions without thinking about the fact that this is a professor sleeping with his direct subordinate and how trapped this entire scenario makes your roommate if it goes forward -- can't dump a guy controlling your phd.", "NTA - this should be reported. The school can conduct an investigation to determine if she should maintain the scholarship, if she should keep his job, etc. You're right to find this morally unjust. It is. What about a candidate that didn't get the scholarship because your roommate and professor want to go on a romantic vacation in exotic places on the scholarships dime? It's not fair to the other students that were penalized for late papers while she wasn't. It's a clear rule that students and professors cannot enter into relationships. They chose to anyway, so they can deal with the fallout.", "Whether you are the asshole or not you will only get backlash on yourself. Are you prepared for that?

You cannot be expected to just shrug at this. I really hope more people know of this affair and have thus far kept their mouths shut. That way, you're in the clear.\n\nAnd even if not, how much do you like and get along with your roommate, apart from this affair business?

However, I don't want to be pessimistic, but I would bet the university will need concrete evidence before they will even touch it.

Unfortunately things like this get ignored often in that environment.", "you WNBTA for reporting this, so much so in fact that you WOULD be if you DIDN'T report it.\n\nWhen someone is cheating in this manner, even if they aren't directly cheating you, they are cheating someone that would have otherwise won, deserved it, and needed it. If you let this slide, you let whoever that person is that is being cheated, fall through the cracks because not one single person who saw this happening did anything about it.", "Definitely would not be TA for reporting the professor for sexual harassment. The professor is in the wrong here, while the student is being used by someone with power over them.\n\nBut imo you would be TA if you pointedly try to get the student to suffer consequences.

It's none of your business and has nothing to do with you. Why do you want to ruin their lives? Unless you think your roommate is being taken advantage of by the professor.

You could argue there are students out there being treated unfairly because your roommate is getting special favors but they're not being seriously hurt. And you don't actually know for a fact that that's the case. I would ask yourself what is your motivation for crusading for these strangers that may or may not exist. It sounds like you have a problem with your roommate. Sure, cheating is wrong but it's really none of your business and you should stay out of it. YTA.", "NTA, submit your evidence. It's very unfair for those who actually work hard to get their degrees. The professor knew the consequences of getting caught, i.e. his career and marriage.

She should not get an unfair advantage", "The roommate may not have as severe consequences if it comes out the professor was using his position to force her to have sex.", "NTA. Feel free to tell the school, but they might not do anything. My PhD advisor (M50s) had a relationship with his master's student (F20s). Cheated on his wife of 30 years. Master's student was unqualified to work on his grant but given the position anyway. She was also the weakest student to ever be admitted into the PhD program. (Advisor was responsible for both decisions.)\n\nWhen the affair came to light there were no consequences from the university. None.

This isn't \"academic misconduct\" by the student, it's sexual misconduct by the professor. Textbook quid pro quo sexual harassment. If you're in the US report it to the Title IX office.

Your housemate is being sexually exploited by her professor. She may feel she is willingly in this relationship but as a student whose funding and future is dependent on this guy he's the one entirely in the wrong. The power imbalance here makes the relationship totally inappropriate, with the wrong doing on his side. The academic misconduct is on his part not hers and many universities now explicitly forbid this kind of relationship for exactly these reasons. \n\nBased on your post although you seem to be angry at her all I see is wrong doing by him. He is sleeping with a student. He is extended favours to her in return for sex. He has procured funding for her based on receiving sex. He's the one in the wrong here. \n\nNext, if this is the extent of your \"proof\" you need to tread very carefully throwing allegations around. You made a significant number of serious allegations in your post - misappropriation of funding (this could be as serious as a federal offence, if he's misused federal funds) and various abuses of power alongside the affair. Right now all you have is proof of an inappropriate relationship. \n\nReport it to the university - this guy is a sleeze - but only report what you can substantiate, and personally I'd make the complaint about him not her.", "This is very important. Your roommate may think they're making unbiased decisions, but the fact is, it's the professor who has decided that a student's academic opportunities should be influenced by the presence or absence of a sexual relationship. The professor has the power in every meaningful way. \n\nThink of this too: what would happen to your roommate's scholarship, phd candidature, travel opportunities etc if they decided to end the relationship on their own? If someone can't walk out of a relationship without losing their ability to support themself, or without losing significant career opportunities, they are not in a relationship where agency between partners is equal. \n\nPlease understand that your roommate is being preyed upon here. I know it's galling to see them given opportunities they might not otherwise have, but consider too that they're also being prevented from coming across different opportunities that they would otherwise encounter through hard work, skill and learning. A truly secure professional life is being denied them by someone who has a responsibility to look out for their best interests. They're a victim.", "Yeah you\u2019re being a complete asshole in your framing of the situation.
