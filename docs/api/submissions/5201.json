It's unfair, disgusting, and overall nasty and any punishment that would come out of you telling on them would be due to their own disgusting behavior.\n\nDo it. For the sake of ethics and morality, seriously, do it.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t think that this is necessarily an AITA situation we have going on here: no one would know that it was you, and if they do, there\u2019s not much they could do about it.\n\nObviously, you should tell. Yeah, they might see you as TA, but who cares what they think? It is the consequence of their actions. If you\u2019re worried about how much grief you\u2019ll cause them, just try to think about the good things that will come from you informing the school:\n\n1. The professor will lose their job, which directly results in them no longer being able to prey on students (at least at this school, unless they\u2019re completely blacklisted, which would be ideal)\n\n2. The professor\u2019s spouse would find out the truth and *hopefully* leave them to find someone who will treat them better. It saves from many many more years to come of lies and secrets since everything will come to the surface.\n\n3. The scholarship might go to someone who *actually* deserves it. Though I am curious as to why you say they would be unable to ever further their education again.\n\n4. An investigation would be started on the professor and the school would find out about any past relations they\u2019ve had with other students, and maybe even start to investigate other professors that they deem suspicious.\n\nSo I say go for it, but again, I don\u2019t think this is an AITA situation. Yes, you are worried about ruining their lives, it\u2019s very sweet of you, but you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about doing the right thing because it is the consequence of their own actions.

I wouldn't feel too concerned with the outcome. They both chose to enter the relationship knowing full well the possible outcome.

NTA for doing so. I don't understand why some people are so afraid of being silent, but I would let them know you want protections for retaliation. The scholarship thing is BS. The infidelity is BS.

And I mean documented proof that what you \u201cthink\u201d is happening (no penalties for late work if others are held to that standard, photographic or other proof of an affair).  Just by accusing these people can ruin their lives as in our world now, facts don\u2019t matter.\n\nIs this situation hurting you in anyway or are you just morally outraged?  Not that I am saying that either is invalid if there really is misconduct, but examine your motives first as they could be skewing the way you are reading what you see.\n\nAlso, I am not sure what country you are in, but make sure you understand the rules of what you are accusing.  Relations between professor and student are frowned upon in the US, but unless you can prove that there really is a more than platonic relationship then you need to gather more evidence.  \n\nHave you thought about asking your roommate what is going on?", "NTA, that is super unfair.", "If people working very hard are stripped from any academic opportunity because someone decided to trade sex for them, you should say something.

That being said, I'm not sure it's a good idea either. You'd essentially be the one potentially ruining multiple lives regardless of it being deserved or not.\n\n\nIf it were me, I'd just look the other way in this case and let someone else catch on and report it. Personally, I wouldn't want that on my mind that I potentially ruined 2 careers and a family.", "I think morally it's correct to report them but I don't see what good will come of it.

No judgement here", "It is reasonably unlikely that any consequences will fall upon these people simply based on your word/hunch.

You can say whatever you want if you feel that you would be doing so in good faith, but I\u2019d think really hard about whether that\u2019s true and what objective evidence you really can provide. NTA if you\u2019re acting in good faith based on concrete evidence. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right, but when my parents were in grad school and when I was, faculty carrying on with grad students was pretty common.

Report it if you like, but don\u2019t be surprised if it doesn\u2019t go the way you want it to. Professors take care of each other and chances are your roommate will get eaten up and spit out of the system. Most likely, everyone will know it was you who blew the whistle and no professor will make your life easy after that, forcing you to transfer at some point. I\u2019ve seen all of this happen before.", "What is your motivation for reporting this? \nWhat do you hope to gain?\n\nReporting this could be life ruining for both parties and that is huge. Most especially for your room mate. \n\nIt is wrong for the professor to be having a sexual relationship with a student. Period. You can report this anonymously, and you can do so without using your roommate\u2019s name. Hopefully, this will be enough to open an investigation, and scare the living shit out of the professor. The goal here would be for him to stop dating students. \n\nAs for the scholarship, are you aware of how this is awarded? What the criteria is? Who actually awards the scholarship and if the prof does anything other than provide a recommendation? Are you saying your roommate would not get this scholarship at all otherwise?\n\nThis is a tricky situation. I don\u2019t have any issues with this prof being called out and punished etc. I am terribly concerned about your room mate. \n\nThink about your own motivations. What reporting would serve. Figure out all possible options first. \n\nIf you have a student union, this would be a good time to head over and get some advice.", "Well you can report her and the professor for having an affair and how the professor broke the rules by extending submission time for her and etc. But as for scholarship it's better not to report about it because you don't have any substantial proof for it but if you have then you can go ahead. \n\nAnd as for how your report may ruin her and professor life it depends. But first make sure whether she knows that the professor is married or not because he may have lied to her ( a possibility) but be careful about it. You don't have to carry the burden of ruining someone's life because this is all the result of their own actions. If they had not done what they did then I would also have no reason or need to report their actions.", "Go for it. \n\nThe improper relationship is none of your business, imho.

Professor is the one who gave different treatment, and may have influenced the scholarship.\n\nIt bugs me when such stories are presented as though the student is the one who made all this happen and the professor is a helpless bystander, as though it isn't the professor in a position of power, who is the one who is supposed to know better, and who is the only one with the ability to make any unfair treatment happen.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In a perfect world every academic degree, funding and subsequent job opportunity would be based 100% on merit. But that\u2019s not how it plays out in a lot of situations. And I don\u2019t think the harm (from an academic perspective, the professor\u2019s marriage is none of your business/concern) warrants your involvement.

I\u2019ll be honest other committee members probably could sniff this out.", "This makes even less sense, actually, at least in the US. Faculty do not have \u201csole decision making\u201d in any sense over research dollars. Dollars from NIH/NSF are held by the university and administered on the professor\u2019s behalf and the only thing they can hire are the unnamed staff slots (ie FTEs) they\u2019ve been awarded. However, a student brought into a program of study generally needs more support than that and that additional $ is collectively doled out. Some depts are poor enough that no prof can afford to pull someone in unilaterally at all, though this is more common in humanities and behavioral/applied science than biotech/engineering. There may be some way that people can pull students in on FTEs but it\u2019s not something I\u2019m aware of.", "that\u2019s what i\u2019m saying- it makes more sense to report them for the relationship than academic misconduct because if they\u2019re in a relationship then the school can see the academic effects.
