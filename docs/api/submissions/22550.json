That isn\u2019t nice regardless of reasons.  You knew he likes to cook for his family and now you have taken that away from him.\n\nYou should have spoken with the father and declined to cook at some of the gatherings instead of horading them all.", "ESH. I think your gf's father is wrong for sure. He should not have spoken to your gf that way. But you shouldn't have blown up at him. It think he's jealous and intimidated. He used to being top dog when it comes to cooking, and he obviously took a lot of pride in doing it. Now he probably feels second rate. While you  and your gf didn't put him in that position purpose, it can be hard for a parent to let go. He probably feels like chopped liver, and that he's taken a low rung position in his daughter's life when they may have been a lot closer. Now he could certainly communicate that a lot better! So he's still a jerk  for not explaining his feelings. But you and your gf could probably make the situation a lot better if you can find a way to include him, and let him know that he is still important to her. Have you guys never gone fishing? Hunting? Worked on a project together? If this woman is important to you, then you should try to hang out with her Dad. I mean, you said it's been four years. And in that time you have never really talked to him or spent time with him?", "ESH leaning YTA.  Can't defend her father's actions at all but saying you stole his thunder is a massive understatement.  YTA especially for being a trained chef and calling a backyard cook's food garbage.", "Why does it have to be an all or nothing?  You both are acting like the stereotype of \"egotistical\" chefs.  Can't his food be appreciated as well as yours?  A little mutual respect could go a long way.  \n\nESH", "How seriously should Mike Tyson take a challenge if it's given by a kid? You're a trained chef working at an upscale restaurant. You obviously don't need to prove yourself. Dad's feeling replaced, and men aren't good when they're emasculated. I'm not excusing his behavior, but he's lashing out because he's hurt. Maybe your GF and her family could let her dad host every once in a while or find another way for him to contribute, so he's not feeling \"kicked out.\" But he's def being a jerk. You're not really helping the situation either. It was kind of a low blow, and you're really only lowering yourself to his level. It's Meet the Fockers but less funny. The way her dad blew up at her at the end is an indication of his pain, but his inferiority complex is not her fault, and he shouldn't be taking it out on her. It's not technically your fault either, but you are the source of it. It's hard for some parents to be replaced, and it sounds like he was man of the house for a long time with a bunch of girls who needed their dad. Now, his oldest doesn't. It's a rough blow. Again, I'm not saying it's excusable, but maybe have a little compassion and put yourself in his shoes. Maybe see if he's willing to have a heart to heart. If you love this girl as you say you do and you want to marry her some day, she will need her dad there and he'll never forgive himself if he's not there because he's being petty.", "ESH", "Eh\u2026ESH but with the arrow pointing mostly at FIL\n\nSounds like FIL is being a jerk about it and being petty.\n\nHowever I put a little bit of AH blame on you too - by snapping insults at him you just fanned the flames more.  I get being upset and wanting to stand up for your GF who was upset but that wasn\u2019t the way to deal with it.  Next time just walk away.", "ESH because of the \"garbage\" comment. I know you wanted to hit him where it hurt the most, but you sound kind of a snob calling his cooking \"garbage\". He is an AH because cooking would have been a perfect bonding opportunity between FIL and son in law, but he let his ego get in the way.", "ESH and ffs, what is it with men and their egos??? especially in the most useless and stupid situations...  why ruin a family dynamic because their huge ego got hurt? i just don't understand..", "esh", "ESH but you also sound like a pompous kid lol. You\u2019re only 27 you still have a ton to learn yourself, all I saw was boast boast boast.", "YTA. Tbh you sound like an egotistical jerk.", "NTA but I am leaning towards ESH. \n\nI think the father may feel intimidated by you. I know my own dad is scared of me not needing him, and even though my fianc\u00e9 knows how to do plenty of things my dad does, I still call on my dad every once in awhile to make him feel like he\u2019s apart of my life and can help me, acts of service is how he shows his love for us. I don\u2019t think it was right of him to say what he did to your lady. However, I think a conversation between you and him should at least be attempted. Conversation doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be confrontation. You understandably have a great knowledge of cooking procedure, techniques and obviously have a lot of skill. Maybe once you talk you can work on a meal to make together. You should be able to break things down into a simpler manner for him and perhaps the two of you can create something beautiful together. I think it\u2019s about respecting both of your feelings.", "NTA. \n\nDude. You defended your girlfriend from abuse and gave that man some cold hard truth. Only reason you were disrespectful to him was because of the disgusting way he treated his daughter - whose own mother sadly doesn't give a shit about.\n\nYou didn't steal his thunder. You didn't turn up to his house one day with a kickass turkey at Thanksgiving and let his own offering go untouched. You had an event you cooked for, everyone liked it, nothing you did with any arrogance or malice. He's just being a spiteful, jealous, childish old man. The fact his other daughters also are on your side speaks for itself.", "NTA. Gf is right that maybe you could be a little more restrained, but fuck that dude anyway. Anyone so consumed by resentment that he can\"t appreciate having a chef in the family is honestly complete trash. Got a good friend who is a chef, and when he does a meal, everyone is always excited to come and enjoy the food.", "NTA FIL let his frustration build for years. He could have said something or asked for tips. He could have helped out in the kitchen or simply said how he felt earlier. It\u2019s clearly a communication issue and one his daughter didn\u2019t deserve to have thrown in her face", "I would say ultimately NTA, but your parting words to him was a bit A H-ish, but I get it, tensions were high. Ideally you didn't double down on the situation, especially it's on a topic your gf's dad has a complex over.\n\nThat being said, your GF's dad is insecure and made his own daughter cry... because you cook good? He should apologize to you and your gf, then you should apologize for what you said. \n\nMy dad would be so happy to have a son in law who can cook me good food because then he can take care of me. Your GF's dad might be hurt that she's no longer depending on him and that sucks but your gf's almost 30 fucking years old... GF's dad needs to let it go.", "NTA  Defending your girlfriend is never wrong, but do agree you went overboard. Is there some reason that both of you can't cook something? There must be one dish of that the family likes. Understand his position, since you took over doing something for his family that he has always done he is probably feeling unappreciated and unwanted in his own house. H ou w would you feel if the roles were reversed?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Dad's inferiority complex is really unfortunate and he was wrong to take it out on you but you certainly didn't help matters with your showboating.

And I'm saying this as a pastry chef with nearly as many years in the kitchen as you've been alive, who's dealt with the same in my own very food oriented family. I eat every meal with a smile and compliments especially the desserts even when I know I could've done better. Family meals aren't about the quality of the food, it's about the quality of the time spent together and you're ruining that for your girlfriend's family, not just her dad, with your arrogant bullshit.
