I think your gf's father is wrong for sure. He should not have spoken to your gf that way. But you shouldn't have blown up at him. It think he's jealous and intimidated. He used to being top dog when it comes to cooking, and he obviously took a lot of pride in doing it. Now he probably feels second rate. While you  and your gf didn't put him in that position purpose, it can be hard for a parent to let go. He probably feels like chopped liver, and that he's taken a low rung position in his daughter's life when they may have been a lot closer. Now he could certainly communicate that a lot better! So he's still a jerk  for not explaining his feelings. But you and your gf could probably make the situation a lot better if you can find a way to include him, and let him know that he is still important to her. Have you guys never gone fishing? Hunting? Worked on a project together? If this woman is important to you, then you should try to hang out with her Dad. I mean, you said it's been four years. And in that time you have never really talked to him or spent time with him?", "ESH leaning YTA.

YTA especially for being a trained chef and calling a backyard cook's food garbage.", "Why does it have to be an all or nothing?  You both are acting like the stereotype of \"egotistical\" chefs.

Maybe your GF and her family could let her dad host every once in a while or find another way for him to contribute, so he's not feeling \"kicked out.\" But he's def being a jerk. You're not really helping the situation either. It was kind of a low blow, and you're really only lowering yourself to his level. It's Meet the Fockers but less funny. The way her dad blew up at her at the end is an indication of his pain, but his inferiority complex is not her fault, and he shouldn't be taking it out on her. It's not technically your fault either, but you are the source of it. It's hard for some parents to be replaced, and it sounds like he was man of the house for a long time with a bunch of girls who needed their dad. Now, his oldest doesn't. It's a rough blow. Again, I'm not saying it's excusable, but maybe have a little compassion and put yourself in his shoes. Maybe see if he's willing to have a heart to heart.

I don\u2019t think it was right of him to say what he did to your lady. However, I think a conversation between you and him should at least be attempted.

The fact his other daughters also are on your side speaks for itself.", "NTA. Gf is right that maybe you could be a little more restrained, but fuck that dude anyway.

Ideally you didn't double down on the situation, especially it's on a topic your gf's dad has a complex over.\n\nThat being said, your GF's dad is insecure and made his own daughter cry... because you cook good? He should apologize to you and your gf, then you should apologize for what you said. \n\nMy dad would be so happy to have a son in law who can cook me good food because then he can take care of me.

GF's dad needs to let it go.", "NTA  Defending your girlfriend is never wrong, but do agree you went overboard. Is there some reason that both of you can't cook something?

Anyway, last winter we went to her father's place, and i thought i'd make some for him. So i did, spent over an hour cooking it and served it.   \n\n\nHe took one bite, got up, went to the frige, got a bottle of heinz ketchup, got back to his seat, and splattered an ungodly ammount of it on his plate as i watched in horror, completelly destroying the balance of flavors of the dish. Girlfriend glanced at me with an expression of dread and guilt, i could hear her thoughts *\"i'm so sorry, we're viking barbarians we're not used to civilized food, please don't guillotine my father!\"* well at least i'm pretty sure that's what she was thinking...   \n\n\nI'm still unsure wether he hates me deeply and was making a power move, or if decades of eating surstr\u00f6mming have given him the palate of a covid-ridden chainsmoking dung-beetle. But we've been laughing about it behind his back a whole lot ever since.", "NTA", ">  I enjoy cooking for others, seeing people happy while because of something I cooked is the kind of feeling I live for.\n\nPerhaps he felt that way about cooking for his family and now that feeling is gone.", "You have a mouth, you can politely decline occasionally. You could have also talked to him and saw how he felt about you cooking at functions sometimes. This is not a good start if you want to join this family without resentment.", "Read the room dude ! Would you have done this to a grandma?", ">> Dad's feeling replaced\n\n> After reading a few other comments it really does look that way.\n\nAnd you're just realizing that NOW? LOL.. come on...", "Offer to alternate cooking at family get togethers and occasionally maybe both of you can collaborate on a big feast. You both share a passion but egos and pride are getting in the way. \n\n\u201cFIL, things have gotten unnecessarily heated due to a lack of communication. I\u2019d like us to start building a friendship based on our mutual love of (daughter/gf) and cooking for loved ones. Hopefully we can agree that apologies need to be made on both sides and move on. I\u2019m open to planning a fishing/hunting \u201cguys trip\u201d so we can talk man to man and get to know each other.\u201d", "I mean...at this point you guys have a burnt bridge that needs repairing. He said he wouldn't walk her down the aisle to you lol. Total missed opportunity to have cooking be something you do together as boys.\n\nI don't think he's going to want to go fishing and be chill with you.", "A fear is when you think something bad might happen. It's not a \"fear\" when you did in fact replace him as the family special event cook. You literally took over one of his roles in his family.", "So OP has to coddle the feeling of a middle aged grown fucking man because he cant handle that his daughters BF, who is a professionally trained chef, is a better cook than him? \n\nSince when was coddling the feeling of a insecure person EVER the answer? \n\nOP NTA"]}
