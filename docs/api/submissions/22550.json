I think your gf's father is wrong for sure. He should not have spoken to your gf that way. But you shouldn't have blown up at him. It think he's jealous and intimidated. He used to being top dog when it comes to cooking, and he obviously took a lot of pride in doing it. Now he probably feels second rate. While you  and your gf didn't put him in that position purpose, it can be hard for a parent to let go. He probably feels like chopped liver, and that he's taken a low rung position in his daughter's life when they may have been a lot closer. Now he could certainly communicate that a lot better! So he's still a jerk  for not explaining his feelings. But you and your gf could probably make the situation a lot better if you can find a way to include him, and let him know that he is still important to her. Have you guys never gone fishing? Hunting? Worked on a project together? If this woman is important to you, then you should try to hang out with her Dad. I mean, you said it's been four years. And in that time you have never really talked to him or spent time with him?", "ESH leaning YTA.

YTA especially for being a trained chef and calling a backyard cook's food garbage.", "Why does it have to be an all or nothing?  You both are acting like the stereotype of \"egotistical\" chefs.

You're a trained chef working at an upscale restaurant. You obviously don't need to prove yourself. Dad's feeling replaced, and men aren't good when they're emasculated.

Maybe your GF and her family could let her dad host every once in a while or find another way for him to contribute, so he's not feeling \"kicked out.\" But he's def being a jerk. You're not really helping the situation either. It was kind of a low blow, and you're really only lowering yourself to his level. It's Meet the Fockers but less funny. The way her dad blew up at her at the end is an indication of his pain, but his inferiority complex is not her fault, and he shouldn't be taking it out on her. It's not technically your fault either, but you are the source of it. It's hard for some parents to be replaced, and it sounds like he was man of the house for a long time with a bunch of girls who needed their dad. Now, his oldest doesn't. It's a rough blow. Again, I'm not saying it's excusable, but maybe have a little compassion and put yourself in his shoes. Maybe see if he's willing to have a heart to heart.

I don\u2019t think it was right of him to say what he did to your lady. However, I think a conversation between you and him should at least be attempted.

The fact his other daughters also are on your side speaks for itself.", "NTA. Gf is right that maybe you could be a little more restrained, but fuck that dude anyway.

Ideally you didn't double down on the situation, especially it's on a topic your gf's dad has a complex over.\n\nThat being said, your GF's dad is insecure and made his own daughter cry... because you cook good? He should apologize to you and your gf, then you should apologize for what you said. \n\nMy dad would be so happy to have a son in law who can cook me good food because then he can take care of me.

GF's dad needs to let it go.", "NTA  Defending your girlfriend is never wrong, but do agree you went overboard. Is there some reason that both of you can't cook something?
