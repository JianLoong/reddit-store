And she should be happy you\u2019ve spend $700 on the gifts at all! I would be like \ud83d\ude33 if my partner spent that much on 2 gifts. The fact she pouted even though you made her aware that her gifts would be late makes her a bit spoiled really. And the fact that she expected another expensive gift in place until her other presents got there is unreasonable as well. \n\nI\u2019d love squishmallows.

You ALSO got her some cute small gifts to open on her actual birthday and she still somehow was disappointed anyway. \n\nOP, you've done nothing wrong here. And I think your girlfriend has some seriously unrealistic expectations that are probably fueled by the way that her family treats her birthdays and holidays. \n\nIt would be a really good idea to sit her down and talk through this with her. You don't have the same means as her father and you already made a big investment into her birthday. I know we all have our different love languages, but your relationship shouldn't revolve around how many expensive things you're able to buy for her.

If I were you, I'd be upset with my girlfriend for acting the way she did. You warned her ahead of time that her presents were delayed, she knew the situation but made you look bad anyway. I think she acted disappointed in front of her family because she knew they would misunderstand the situation and offer you money, and she wanted extra presents.", "NTA, and all these people sound absolutely awful.

But that is not what happened, you gave her her favorite candy which is very thoughtful along with generous gifts coming in a day or two. Your girlfriend is spoiled and greedy. I would tell her and her dad that you are not her daddy, and if she wants a sugar daddy she should sign up for seeking arraignment", "Are you really ok with a relationship based entirely on how extravagant your gifts are? You already worked extra and went without to get this gift. How much extra could you work and how much more could you live without in order to sustain this relationship, knowing that the relationship will be over as soon as you burn out?", "Omg just stop. That\u2019s the worst of materialistic, capitalistic culture coming out, and if you can\u2019t meet it then you\u2019re always going to be judged as not good enough.\n\nThis is literally the stuff all those Xmas stories warn about being against. If your girlfriend can\u2019t tolerate a day or two of waiting and she has to have the super expensive gifts as *placeholders*, then you need to rethink your relationship if it\u2019s based on what you can buy her.", "ew", "I know right! I have the big raccoon Rocky and the big cow Connor and I\u2019m pretty sure my bf is going to get me the pigeon/duck for Christmas and I\u2019m super excited about it \ud83d\ude01", "I wouldn't, but I also wouldn't want chocolates or fancy shoes lol. Get me a $30 pack of flower bulbs and I'm set, no placeholder needed.", "Yeah that's definitely more of a family culture thing and it sounds like the way your family does it is entirely reasonable and normal. In my case I was raised not to expect or ask for presents so when I read about spoilt behaviour it really bothers me. There's a way to go about having a wish list and OP's gf's way defo ain't it.", "Poshmark, she does a lot of her clothes shopping through that to get things cheaper since most of it is used. The belt came from someplace else since it's custom-made and engraved.", "They\u2019re a status symbol. Think of it like having an Audi is nicer than having a Honda even if the two aren\u2019t super different. They both drive and you can get similar models, but the Honda just doesn\u2019t look as nice and other people won\u2019t be impressed that you spent so much money on a car. \n\nBut she\u2019s way too materialistic about this. You\u2019re NTA", "I've rarely seen new Louboutins for less than $700. So good for you for getting a deal on them. I have a pair that I got for fairly cheap because they were a size 12. I wear an 11. They run small, but aren't really that comfortable even if you get them to fit. I haven't worn my pair in a decade because I get temporary nerve injury from wearing them. They are, honestly, chauffeur shoes-- you can walk from the door to the car (but someone else is driving) and then walk from the car back to the door. You'll spend less than 10 minutes standing in them. \n\nHas your girlfriend ever worn a pair?", "A big part of why they are a status symbol is because if you walk outside in them, or walk in them much at all the red wears off. So you wear them to show off that a) you are not a pleb that needs to walk anywhere and b) you can afford a lot of expensive shoes so that none of them wear out at all.", "Got it. Yes - Poshmark would make a huge difference! I assumed new.", "She was upset over that yes but she and her dad wound up more upset i didn't take her dad's money offering to get her something else. im asking more if i was wrong to not just take his money to get her something off her list.", "Gifts are my love language too. Ex got me a crappy fridge magnet of a favourite character once just because. Still love it. Its the thought the counts. I'd rather have the thought than empty money.\n\nSome people are just spoiled. OP needs to be careful about what he's getting into.", "Yeah, no joke. Poor dude is going to work himself to death to keep her happy.  This isn't going to be a one-time instance. It's going to play itself out over and over and over again.", "My daughter has a deer squishmallow (named Dawn) that she takes to every single one of her vaccinations as a comfort friend.  Dawn is like FAMILY now. LOL", "Wait you got her used louboutins? Did you ask her if that ok though?? I have some and the shoes are meant to conform to the fit of your feet after wear and it\u2019s kinda hard to do that if it\u2019s preloved.", "No you\u2019re not wrong. She should be grateful for what she gets and she\u2019s being a spoiled brat. \n\nYou might want to seriously consider if this is the life you want to have in the future. Constantly working hard to spend loads of money on expensive items, and then still have her upset with what she gets. I\u2019d be telling my partner where the door is. Like, all your hard work to earn the money to buy her these things means nothing to her. You took extra shifts and left yourself without stuff to get her those presents and she doesn\u2019t give a crap, and wants you to get her more expensive stuff rather than some little things so she had something to open. Only selfish one here is her.", "It doesn\u2019t make sense that your girlfriend would be upset when she already knows you got her gifts from her wish list. Same thing for your dad. It makes even less sense that he would want to drop an additional $700, knowing that the real gifts are coming in a few days.  I\u2019m saying I don\u2019t believe that people act like this in real life.", "My son has a dragon one and he loves it, sleeps with it every night", "My squishmallow (gifted by my nephew) was my hospital buddy for a week this year (neurosurgery all good now). I also have a small version from him as well that was for my kitties at the time. :)", "LOL people DO act like this in real life. It\u2019s sad but true.", "This makes total sense to me for people who are used to everything revolving around them.  \n\nI'd be willing to be she wanted to go home and post those great gifts on social media for everyone to see.  She didn't get the thrill of opening them in front of an audience, so it means less to her."]}
