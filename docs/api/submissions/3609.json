And she should be happy you\u2019ve spend $700 on the gifts at all! I would be like \ud83d\ude33 if my partner spent that much on 2 gifts. The fact she pouted even though you made her aware that her gifts would be late makes her a bit spoiled really. And the fact that she expected another expensive gift in place until her other presents got there is unreasonable as well. \n\nI\u2019d love squishmallows.

Working extra hours, cutting back on your own personal spending, ordering the gifts earlier in hopes that they would arrive on time. You've gone above and beyond to show her that you love and appreciate her and want her to feel special on her birthday.

You ALSO got her some cute small gifts to open on her actual birthday and she still somehow was disappointed anyway. \n\nOP, you've done nothing wrong here. And I think your girlfriend has some seriously unrealistic expectations that are probably fueled by the way that her family treats her birthdays and holidays. \n\nIt would be a really good idea to sit her down and talk through this with her. You don't have the same means as her father and you already made a big investment into her birthday. I know we all have our different love languages, but your relationship shouldn't revolve around how many expensive things you're able to buy for her.

If I were you, I'd be upset with my girlfriend for acting the way she did. You warned her ahead of time that her presents were delayed, she knew the situation but made you look bad anyway. I think she acted disappointed in front of her family because she knew they would misunderstand the situation and offer you money, and she wanted extra presents.", "NTA, and all these people sound absolutely awful.

You already worked extra and went without to get this gift. How much extra could you work and how much more could you live without in order to sustain this relationship, knowing that the relationship will be over as soon as you burn out?", "Omg just stop. That\u2019s the worst of materialistic, capitalistic culture coming out, and if you can\u2019t meet it then you\u2019re always going to be judged as not good enough.\n\nThis is literally the stuff all those Xmas stories warn about being against. If your girlfriend can\u2019t tolerate a day or two of waiting and she has to have the super expensive gifts as *placeholders*, then you need to rethink your relationship if it\u2019s based on what you can buy her.", "ew", "I know right! I have the big raccoon Rocky and the big cow Connor and I\u2019m pretty sure my bf is going to get me the pigeon/duck for Christmas and I\u2019m super excited about it \ud83d\ude01", "I wouldn't, but I also wouldn't want chocolates or fancy shoes lol. Get me a $30 pack of flower bulbs and I'm set, no placeholder needed.", "Yeah that's definitely more of a family culture thing and it sounds like the way your family does it is entirely reasonable and normal. In my case I was raised not to expect or ask for presents so when I read about spoilt behaviour it really bothers me. There's a way to go about having a wish list and OP's gf's way defo ain't it.", "Poshmark, she does a lot of her clothes shopping through that to get things cheaper since most of it is used. The belt came from someplace else since it's custom-made and engraved.", "They\u2019re a status symbol. Think of it like having an Audi is nicer than having a Honda even if the two aren\u2019t super different. They both drive and you can get similar models, but the Honda just doesn\u2019t look as nice and other people won\u2019t be impressed that you spent so much money on a car. \n\nBut she\u2019s way too materialistic about this. You\u2019re NTA", "I've rarely seen new Louboutins for less than $700. So good for you for getting a deal on them. I have a pair that I got for fairly cheap because they were a size 12. I wear an 11. They run small, but aren't really that comfortable even if you get them to fit. I haven't worn my pair in a decade because I get temporary nerve injury from wearing them. They are, honestly, chauffeur shoes-- you can walk from the door to the car (but someone else is driving) and then walk from the car back to the door. You'll spend less than 10 minutes standing in them. \n\nHas your girlfriend ever worn a pair?", "A big part of why they are a status symbol is because if you walk outside in them, or walk in them much at all the red wears off. So you wear them to show off that a) you are not a pleb that needs to walk anywhere and b) you can afford a lot of expensive shoes so that none of them wear out at all.", "Got it. Yes - Poshmark would make a huge difference! I assumed new.", "She was upset over that yes but she and her dad wound up more upset i didn't take her dad's money offering to get her something else. im asking more if i was wrong to not just take his money to get her something off her list.", "Gifts are my love language too. Ex got me a crappy fridge magnet of a favourite character once just because. Still love it. Its the thought the counts. I'd rather have the thought than empty money.\n\nSome people are just spoiled. OP needs to be careful about what he's getting into.", "Yeah, no joke. Poor dude is going to work himself to death to keep her happy.  This isn't going to be a one-time instance. It's going to play itself out over and over and over again.", "My daughter has a deer squishmallow (named Dawn) that she takes to every single one of her vaccinations as a comfort friend.  Dawn is like FAMILY now. LOL", "Wait you got her used louboutins? Did you ask her if that ok though?? I have some and the shoes are meant to conform to the fit of your feet after wear and it\u2019s kinda hard to do that if it\u2019s preloved.", "No you\u2019re not wrong. She should be grateful for what she gets and she\u2019s being a spoiled brat. \n\nYou might want to seriously consider if this is the life you want to have in the future. Constantly working hard to spend loads of money on expensive items, and then still have her upset with what she gets. I\u2019d be telling my partner where the door is. Like, all your hard work to earn the money to buy her these things means nothing to her. You took extra shifts and left yourself without stuff to get her those presents and she doesn\u2019t give a crap, and wants you to get her more expensive stuff rather than some little things so she had something to open. Only selfish one here is her.", "It doesn\u2019t make sense that your girlfriend would be upset when she already knows you got her gifts from her wish list. Same thing for your dad. It makes even less sense that he would want to drop an additional $700, knowing that the real gifts are coming in a few days.  I\u2019m saying I don\u2019t believe that people act like this in real life.", "My son has a dragon one and he loves it, sleeps with it every night", "My squishmallow (gifted by my nephew) was my hospital buddy for a week this year (neurosurgery all good now). I also have a small version from him as well that was for my kitties at the time. :)", "LOL people DO act like this in real life. It\u2019s sad but true.", "This makes total sense to me for people who are used to everything revolving around them.  \n\nI'd be willing to be she wanted to go home and post those great gifts on social media for everyone to see.  She didn't get the thrill of opening them in front of an audience, so it means less to her.", "NTA her dad is an insecure brat. Like father, like daughter. This kind of ungrateful drama after your warned her ahead of time ought to make your reconsider the relationship.  \n\nNot sure how he believed you were going to respond to him trying to weirdly insert his money where it hadn't been asked to be. \n\n\"No thanks, Kevin. I'm not interested in cash I didn't earn.  Right now I just need a little respect and patience, if you don't mind. I'm just an ordinary kid, not a night deposit box. You could just give your daughter some cash if you're really looking for something to spend.\" \n\nI may be biased. I have a certain loathing for people who believe throwing money at a situation is the default answer no matter what. Or who think money is the same as being liked and appreciated.  You can buy toadies. You van definitely buy politicians, You can't buy real friends who will drop by the hospital when you're deathly ill.", "NTA.... run dude", "I'm concerned you got scammed on the shoes but, definitely NTA. She knew her \"real\" gift was coming later, she chose to act ungrateful. I would have been ecstatic with squishies and chocolate for my bday. The father & uncle enabling her may be the reason for the spoiled brat behaviour but it does not excuse it.", "NTA so you have spent 700 on her and they r saying your not serious about her because they were a little delayed?", "NTA\n\nI would never ever ask a gift of anyone that required them to work extra hours to obtain. \n\nThis will be every birthday/holiday/anniversary for the rest of your life if you stay with this girl and her family. Is that what you want?", "NTA, and that family sounds awful.", "NTA\n\nBut you're naively walking into a den of red flags.\n\nYour gf asked you for extremely expensive gifts that you had to work very hard to get.  Then, when she opened the placeholder full well knowing the big gifts were delayed, she got petulant and said you should have gotten her even more expensive gifts to tide her over.  Then daddy gets involved and tries to throw his money at princess, despite the fact that the gifts were coming, and she got mad at you for not filling her grabby hands with whatever she could get, which was the reason she was openly pouty.  She knew daddy would rush to pacify her and now they've banded together to bully you into agreeing that real love = money spent.\n\nThis level of spoiled behavior isn't normal.  It doesn't matter if her father normalized it, you should mean more to her than whatever expensive gifts she can wring out of you if she really cared about you.  If you stay with her despite this extremely clear vision of what your future together will be and where her values actually lie, you won't really have anyone to blame when every anniversary, holiday and birthday turns into a fight because she has no appreciation for what you spend on her because it will never be enough to match daddy, and daddy will be waiting in the wings to use these moments to say that you must not really love his daughter while he then uses his own money to compete with you for her affection.  And since his daughter values money and toys over feelings, that's a fight daddy will always win.", "NTA You are dating someone whose family clearly values money more than good intentions. That\u2019s a :redflag: right there.", "NTA. \n\nRun. Run for the hills. This woman and her family will break you. You\u2019ll drain your finances or run yourself ragged trying to keep up with her demands.", "NTA.  What a materialistic girlfriend.    And her dad?  Kind of a jerk thing to do.  Why on earth would you work extra hours for expensive gifts?  It\u2019s excessive.", "NTA run", "NTA but info: where the heck did you get Louboutin shoes for under $700? Don't they usually retail for north of 1K?", "NTA. But your gf is incredibly materialistic, think about if you really want to go through this every Christmas and birthday. 700 bucks for a birthday present is absolutely insane.", "Not only did you get her the belt, you also got her the shoes when she only wanted one or the other. And it took a lot of extra work for you to save up the money. You are a great boyfriend. She, on the other hand, is spoiled and ungrateful. I would have expected flowers as a place holder and nothing more, knowing that the other gifts were on their way. Waiting a day or a week is truly not a big deal. The dad\u2019s demands were ridiculous and it sounds like he raised his daughter to be greedy. Also, giving you money was so insulting when you are a hard working man who went above and beyond already. \n\nI love designer shoes. I only wear designer shoes, because it\u2019s my thing. I would never ask my boyfriend to work extra hours or to cut back on stuff to buy me a pair. And if he did, I would be so freaking grateful I\u2019d cry. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. This personally would be the end of the relationship for me.", "I suggest you reevaluate this relationship.  Unless you want to be valued according to the price of your gifts.  This is not just your girlfriend either.   The father shows you that this is a big part of the family culture.  NTA.", "NTA, you've spent a crapton of money for her birthday and even got her a little something to open on the day itself and she's complaining. Spoiled brat!", "NTA.\n\n\nRun from this girlfriend. Now because this girl might be a gold digger in training.\n\nI'm assuming you mean Christian Louboutin shoes, designer shoes famous for their red soles. You brought them, they were later but that isn't your fault, and she is upset that you got her a sweet placeholder so she had something to open. Her dad's actions make me think that this girl is entitled and this is only the beginning.", "Hate people who advice break up out of nowhere for the smallest of things.\n\n\nThis isnt a small thing. This is a snippet of your future. Do you want it ? \n\nAssuming this isnt fake : Bro. RUN.\n\n\nNta", "NTA and run. You will never be good enough for this family or this girl. She's spoiled and materialistic, and it's giving golddigger red flags. You sound young, as well... it's outrageous to expect Louboutins, used or no, from your boyfriend. As a gift, period. Normal people don't feel entitled to these things? (oh, to be rich) That you had to plan and save (and work overtime!) to spend $700 on her for her birthday tells me you make decent money but are not wealthy. Would she be with you/happy with you if you made half what you do? A quarter? Ask yourself those soul-searching questions. I'd get TF out of this relationship if I were you.", "NTA, but that woman is awfully materialistic and entitled.  she only cares about gifts and stuff and money, not about you, and your sacrifices to please her.  you would be better off without her", "NTA!!!!\n\nYou explained there were more gifts coming, I am assuming she knows your approximate finances and still had a hissy fit when you bought her more to placate her.  And then after hearing how much you spent on the soon to arrive gifts her and her family think you aren't committed to her...run and run fast.  \n\nI would never expect my partner to give up so much or work that much more to get me a gift, and then still be ungrateful about it all.  She sounds like she was raised entitled and spoiled and needs to grow up and stop being a selfish child.", "NTA  \nWhat??  \nYou've already spent a huge amount on her, she knew it was coming, only late, and when you thought of how she'd feel if she was left empty-handed and solved that concern, she was disappointed when the expensive gift being delayed turned out to be true?   \nYou're thoughtful. Wayyyy more than her father is, because this feels like he thinks money solves everything.   \nAw no, the baby didn't get her expensive gift ON her Birthday, that can't be! Quick, hurry to the story & give her something else! And you'd better make it expensive!  \nLike what???  \nAnyway. I'll never understand why women want shoes to be gifted to them. Especially the red soled ones. If you want a luxury item, buy it yourself, or dream on. She sure does put a lot of importance on your ability to spend spend spend on exactly what she's listed, it's almost like she's got a shopping basket and you get to pay, you ingrateful squeak, you should be happy you can make her happy by spending big! Yay!  \nDon't know whether you live together or not, but I wonder whether the pressure to spend big bucks on gifts would still be on when you've got expenses of your own to cover. Would a car repair need to be delayed because she expects you to spend big on her? If at some point you're saving for a downpayment or idk, a car, will you be expected to take on ever more hours just to be able to buy her expensive gifts? Will she do the same or will she just ask her parents for the money and go shopping why you work you beep off? Does she work anywhere near as many hours as you do? Does she ever buy you expensive gifts, or is she relieved that you might not ask for $$ gifts, so she can spoil herself instead and cheap out (in comparison) with you? One thing is for sure: you shouldn't have to exhaust yourself taking on extra hours, nor should you be denying yourself things, just to please her. At the rate you're going, you're spending over a month's wage on her, how much play money do you have for yourself.  \nAt the rate you're going, you're spending over a month's wage on her, how much play money do you have for yourself.  \nSeriously, alll dem questions!  \nHope she's at least grateful when the presents arrive. Seriously. I sure hope she is. But if not... Well... Do they accept returns?", "NTA\n\nThis relationship has a lot of red flags. Id reconsider", "Yta if you stay with her. Do yourself a hugefavour and leave. She does not deserve you at all.", "Run away from these people. Do not look back.", "More info - How long have you been dating her?  I don't think the Louboutin's are the real issue here,  her sense of entitlement and her father being willing to indulge that attitude are huge marinara flags.   \n\nPlease reevaluate your relationship with this person, she has expectations that seem really hard to meet.", "NTA.  You did spend big for her birthday but the items are delayed in shipping.  Instead of coming and just handing her a paper with the tracking numbers you went and bought more items and are being ostracized for getting extra things that were not expensive.  This screams of a spoiled and ungrateful person.  I am thinking that you could buy them a new car as a gift and end up hearing that you should have paid for upgraded wheels, etc.  I feel that nothing will ever be enough for them and it is better to know that now and decide how to proceed with any future there.", "Not only are you NTA, you need to run from that entire family, fast.

Really think if this is the type of family dynamics you want to chain yourself to.", "I tend towards either quirky gifts, or make them myself. Think \"handmade from Italian leather purse\", \"handforged bread knife\" or \"pen made from wood from the White House or Golden Gate Bridge\". Even stuff like custom jewelry, the amount of work is more valuable to me than the cost of the material. \n\nIf they don't appreciate the work put into it, well, it says volumes and you learn real quick who is worth the effort. If someone acts disappointed after you put in a mountain of work, move on. \n\nYour girlfriend is basing your relationship based on the cost of your gift.

I was already stunned when I read the lengths that OP went through to get gf's real presents. But then OP went further and got her favorite candies and plushies to open in front of other people as well. And she knew her real presents were coming, so these were extra presents.
