{"id": 6003, "submission_id": "zz11xg", "title": "AITA For Telling My Daughter That She's The Reason Why Nobody Likes Her?", "selftext": "I, a 40 year old, had my first daughter, I'll call her Sandra, she's 20 years old, with my boyfriend George, who is now 50 years old. When Sandra was 5, I realized that George was abusive so I broke up with him. He didn't have an interest in maintaining a relationship with Sandra or I so I effectively became a single mother and raised Sandra on my own for the next 6 years.\n\nThen, when Sandra was 11 and I was 31, I met a man I'll call Frank, who was 33. We got married a year later and started having children, Sandra's step-siblings, the year after that. Now I am 40, Frank is 42, Sandra's 20, I have a son who I'll call Francis who's 7 years old, twins named Philip and Julia who are 5 years old, and a daughter named Stacey who's 3 years old.\n\nSince Francis was born, Sandra's been complaining to me about how she feels pushed to the side. For the first few months of his life, I can admit that she was somewhat pushed to the side, but that was because he was a baby with health complications and she was a 13 year old who required a lot less intensive attention. Then, when Francis's health got better, I was able to split my time more evenly between the two, but it was never enough for Sandra.\n\nWe've tried family therapy, but Sandra refused to talk. I've tried doing things alone with Sandra but she says she's jealous of her half-siblings who have two parents while she only has one, and, even then, my time is divided. I told her I'm sorry about her jealousy but Frank's a nice man, and the only reason why she feels disconnected from him is because she's being bratty about the changes.\n\nSandra has done nothing but complain about how the younger children are getting more attention than her, and I'm not entertaining that dialogue anymore. Since Philip and Julia were born, I've been telling her that it's her own fault she's not agreeable enough for anybody to spend any time with her, and she's had 6 years alone with me--that should be enough. Sandra responded by getting more and more withdrawn. She was awarded a full scholarship to college and is now two years into it. Since she's started college she's barely come home and, when she does interact with the family, she's been sullen and rude.\n\nI did my best as a mother. I'm sorry she didn't like it. I've still got a family who appreciates me, after all, so I told her that she's the problem because everybody else can get along just fine.\n\nBut I figured that I would check with all of you, to maybe understand her perspective better. She's told me about this part of Reddit and how it's good for questions. So AITA?\n\nEdit: When I say that Sandra had 6 years with me, I meant from the ages of 6 to 11. I was not including the ages of 0 to 5 when she was alone with George and I.\n\nEdit II: Half-siblings I know!

This is something you NEVER SAY to your child. 6 years is enough? What? Sounds like you truly pushed your daughter to the side and when she (rightly) got upset you just blamed it on her being upset. Have fun being no or low contact with your daughter.", "YTA. \n\nYou have to be a parent her whole life not until something new comes along or until she is 13. \n\nI\u2019m going to be upfront and tell you that you will affect her relationships for the rest of her life. She was abandoned by her father and then effectively abandoned by her mother. \n\nDon\u2019t be surprised when she runs into the arms of any one that shows her care or attention, no matter how toxic, because you denied her that during formative years. Beyond that I\u2019d wager that abandonment issues will be very strong. Imagine a romantic partner or friend tries to go separate ways from her, how she will deal with that knowing that her parents abandoned her and now seemingly everyone does. \n\nYou have failed your daughter. \u201cShe had six years alone with me\u2014that should be enough\u201d. \n\nYou are the asshole dude.

How on earth could you say that to your own daughter? The callousness involved in saying something like to your own flesh and blood, and one who has had to suffer a lot of change beggars belief. You need to go think long and hard about things and try to be a nicer human.", "YTA This is your daughter, and even from this post, it's clear you favor the other kids. \"Six years is enough\"? What does that mean? She's desperately trying to communicate emotional needs to her one and only mother, and all you do is insult and demean her.\n\nYou need counseling yourself so you can get over whatever feelings you have here. If you don't change, she is probably better off cutting you off and finding people who actually treat her with love. I hope you fix things before it comes to that.", "YTA. Calling Sandra a brat won't help solve the conflict.", "YTA. She was the only child for 13 years and had all the attention so for it to suddenly switch would\u2019ve  been hard for her.

I've still got a family who appreciates me, after all, so I told her that she's the problem because everybody else can get along just fine.\n\nThis right here is exactly why YTA, OP. This attitude of \"it is what it is\"  is what your daughter has seen growing up with you. She needed you to be there for her when she was going through a lot, and you didn't even attempt to go the extra mile, let alone the extra centimeter. You basically told her to deal with what you were willing to offer in terms of being a mother, and it's no wonder that she has rejected it.", "Yeah, I think YTA, but we would need to know more about how, exactly, you prepared Sandra for the rush of changes that you forced into her life. Reading your second paragraph, I knew this was going to be about Sandra (rightfully!) feeling tossed to the side.\n\nShe had already been abandoned by her father, who had been abusive prior to the abandonment. You were all she had for 11 years, then suddenly you met a new partner and within two years already had another child with him. At the beginning of her teen years, when she's already going through the changes and challenges of puberty, she suddenly found herself backburnered in her only parent's new life.\n\nHonestly, at some point she's going to have to get her head on straight and move forward with her own life. If she doesn't that's on her. Healing ourselves is part of becoming an adult. BUT, you own the mistakes you made during her formative years and I don't see any regret or taking ownership in your post at all. Without you taking responsibility for your mistakes, I'm afraid she's unlikely to warm back up to you.\n\n*Since she's been 15 you have been telling her that its her own fault she's not agreeable enough for anyone to want to spend time with her*?? How is that a thing any mother says to a 15 year old to feels pushed aside within her own home??\n\nThe way I see it, you made poor choices throughout her life, and you've done very little to mitigate the effects those choices have had on her. You chose a terrible father for her, then you bubbled with her for 6 years creating codependency, then you got married and pregnant within about a year of meeting someone new (presumably without engaging with any family counselling prior to that change, since you don't mention it until later), then you call her bratty and blame her for acting exactly like the sullen teenager one would expect in this situation.\n\nYou really skunked it with her.", "Found another future complainer about being abandoned by her adult children.", "YTA- you were your daughter\u2019s only reliable parent in an abusive household and you were all she had when you left him. It\u2019s natural for first born children to feel sidelined because of siblings, but it sounds like both you and your husband are so focused on your own little family that you forgot she was part of it. A full scholarship is a huge accomplishment and the fact that she is distant is because you have made her feel like an outcast in her home. Look at your actions and realize that she is your family. You may feel appreciated by the rest of your family, but who appreciates her. Also the fact that you told her that no one likes her is so messed up. She deserves so much more than that.", "YTA.\n\nI'm sorry OP, but that's just the case.\n\nYour daughter has told you that she's feeling pushed to the side, and jealous, because she only had 1 parent.\n\nAnd your only reaction, in the end, towards your daughter whom was left behind by her father, is to... Leave her behind.\n\nAnd you wonder *why* she's bitter?\n\nDo everyone a favor and apologize to your daughter. However, I'm not sure this relationship can be saved. If it can, it'll take a lot of efforts from all parties involved.", "YTA. You've been telling your daughter she's the problem since she was a kid. Your \"best\" is not good enough. Hopefully you have learned from your mistakes and your poor choices, and do not repeat this horrible behaviour with your other children, because no child deserves to hear their parents say the things you've said to Sandra.", "YTA\n\nEven though there is a lot of information missing, I've made the determination because this comment speaks volumes.\n\n>I've been telling her that it's her own fault she's not agreeable enough for anybody to spend any time with her, and she's had 6 years alone with me--that should be enough.\n\nIf this is your response to your own child who was abused by her father and her mother cast her aside for a new child with health issues, then I think she has a point and you're twisting this story to make her seem bad. I get it, not every parent is perfect, but you don't say that you spent her first 6 years alone with her and that's \"enough\". What a stupid and heartless thing to say. It all but confirms to your daughter that you are more the issue with her ostracization than her behavior. \n\nHer behavior is a reaction to **you** and **your behavior** raising her. You even admit that you did \"somewhat\" cast her aside when Francis was born and she complained about it. You admit that, and you pretend that going back to splitting that time more evenly afterwards is suddenly a fix to that issue. By your own admission, she was abused by her father and her mother cast her aside for a new family. That's bound to affect her in profound ways, because she grew up with that knowledge and your callousness, lack of awareness, and quite frankly, selfishness doesn't help mend that bond to make it functional.", "YTA. unbelievable. Your own daughter told you point blank what the issu was (which is rare).. vulnerably honest. and your reaction is \"psh she had six years with me already whats the big deal\". I feel bad for her.", "YTA for this: *\"Since Philip and Julia were born, I've been telling her that it's her own fault she's not agreeable enough for anybody to spend any time with her, and she's had 6 years alone with me--that should be enough.\"*\n\nSo you told a 15 year old that she is not agreeable enough for anybody to want to spend time with her. That is a major dick move. I was told that all the time by my mother because was very introverted and neurodivergent. Guess who only sees me very sporadically? \n\nAlso that fact that you think that 6 years being an only child (with 5 of those years being in a household with an abusive adult in it, regardless whether or not he was only abusive to you, children pick up on that shit) is enough and that she should be able to handle the transition to a blended family seamlessly. Even adult children have difficulties becoming a part of a blended family, let alone a child.", "YTA for the way you said things to your daughter. You are clearly not seeing her point of view & dismissing it.", ">I've been telling her that it's her own fault she's not agreeable enough for anybody to spend any time with her, and she's had 6 years alone with me--that should be enough.\n\n>I did my best as a mother.

I've still got a family who appreciates me, after all, so I told her that she's the problem because everybody else can get along just fine.\n\nJust when i was thinking that its just a normal mom not understanding her YA child you had to pull this shit.\n\nYTA \n\nShe must feel that you are forgetting her for your nice new family who gets along perfectly with each other and she is right. She is your child, you are her mother; it was your duty to make sure she adjusts to the changes and feels loved and included instead of telling her that she's the reason nobody likes her.\n\nWell you should wonder the reason why she doesn't like you and your family.", "YTA. I understand your daughter\u2019s point of view but you don\u2019t seem to.\n\nHer bio dad rejected her but that was OK because mom loved her and took care of her.  Then some guy starts taking up mom\u2019s time, then a year later they are getting married and before she has time to adjust to that pop-pop-pop come the new kids.  There\u2019s no way your daughter had a fair share of attention after you met your now husband.  New romances take attention and dedicated time to nurture, planning weddings takes a lot of time, preparing for babies takes time and once those babies are here it is all about them.\n\nIs it that hard to see why she feels you abandoned her like her dad did?  The teenage years are important and when she needed a mother\u2019s guidance you (by your own admission) were focused on your new family.  \n\nWhen you say family therapy do you mean just you and your daughter or have you dragged your husband into it too?  If he\u2019s there that is likely why she\u2019s not engaging.  You shifting your priorities away from her all started with his arrival.  This is something only you and she can mend.  After that, the rest should start falling into place.", ">she's had 6 years alone with me--that should be enough\n\nI'm sorry, what?\n\nRegardless of the circumstances of their birth, if you accept your role as a parent to a child, then it is for LIFE. You don't get to just throw them to one side once you get a perfect \"do over\" family and say \"well we had our fun but my new family is more important\".\n\nWas she acting bratty? Maybe, but she was a teenager! All teens are moody and hormonal and a little selfish. More importantly, she was a traumatised teen. She was abandoned by an abusive father. That will always cut deep. And once her siblings were born, she clearly felt abandoned all over again. Like she didn't matter anymore. \n\nLook, I am sorry you were trapped in an abusive relationship, and I'm sorry if your son was born with health complications, but your daughter was clearly going through a lot of trauma as a teen and you're acting like she deserved it because she wouldn't play happy families. Even now you're basically saying \"Well I'm happy and appreciated, so who cares how she feels?\"\n\nBeing a parent means sacrifice, it means support, it means always being there even if your kid is lashing out.

You have tossed the inconvenient first kid aside in order to have your picture perfect new do-over family. \n\nYTA", "So you've been telling her it's her fault nobody likes her when she's not \"agreeable\" enough when she was 15 after pushing ger to the side for mist of the rest of her puberty..

Accept that responsibility and you may yet be able to salvage your relationship with your eldest\u2026.assuming, of course, you\u2019re not simply looking for an excuse to write her off.\n\nYTA and I cannot help but wonder if the reason Sandra never spoke during therapy was because she knew you weren\u2019t actually listening.", "Okay.\n\nWow.\n\nSo when she was 11, which is already a tumultuous enough age, you met your husband. Cool, it's entirely reasonable that you find someone to love and have some kids with. That's fine. But in the space of only two years, she loses the only person she's had all her life. At 13, due to reasons beyond your control, she loses you even more to her little brother.  He's a poorly baby, so he gets 99% of your attention, which is honestly understandable. But he gets better and soon you can split your time, which was most likely 30-70 in the baby's favour because of the fact he's a baby and you probably didn't want to leave him alone, even with his father for too long. But the 30% you gave your daughter was not often spent just the two of you, was it? She probably had about 2% of your undivided attention before the other three were born.\n\nYou set time aside for her and it was shared with her little brother. That is on you. You lied to your daughter repeatedly about giving her quality time. After a period of time in which she was seeing her mom stressed out, was probably feeling scared herself because 13 is plenty old enough to know what's going on, and was still trying to adjust to her new life. She was on her own at 13 years old. It wasn't entirely your fault, you can't help that your son was ill and it was awful for you, I get it. But I don't think you thought for a second how everything affected your daughter. And you call her bratty for effectively losing her mother? For trying to tell you how she feels? That is so sad. Your poor kid. Did you never consider her once?\n\nAnd to make matters worse, you told her no one in the family liked her. How painful to hear. From the one person who is supposed to love you, the one person who is supposed to be there for you.

I now have a demanding 2 year old, and yes my eldest does not require the same quantity of time as my youngest, she does need quality time with me. My partner makes every effort to ensure she is included in everything too. I schedule 1:1 time with her - she loves musical theatre so we go to shows on the west end together regularly (we live just outside London so is easy to both embrace her passion). We plan weekends around her when she is with us. When I am doing something with her younger sister I always ask if she wants to come (50% of the time she comes to the park with us).

Sandra needs therapeutic help to work through some of her resentment and jealousy. You are not in the wrong for remarrying and having more kids, but the way you dismiss Sandra\u2019s feelings about it is awful.", "They are her half siblings. Step siblings don\u2019t have any  biological parents in common.", "INFO: what is Frank doing to help this relationship with Sandra?\n\nEdit: decided to just add more to this. I think we should analyze exactly what Sandra is saying. She wishes she had two parents and more attention. Is Frank giving her any?\n\nEven if you are giving equal to the kids it\u2019s still unequal in that way if Frank gives all this love to his kids but not to her.\n\nI\u2019m guessing that it\u2019s because you guys are waiting for Sandra to be happy during it, to deserve it? She deserves it just by being the child.\n\nThis is how parenting works. We don\u2019t wait for our child to be nice to us or respond well to us for us to show them love and attention (this is of course within reason as they get older but this is the sentiment to always hold. Sometimes we still have to set rules for our teenagers and that\u2019s love, too, but we shouldn\u2019t silent treatment them or take away all the love when they disobey that stuff is supposed to always be intact (and in tact!)).\n\nSome people parent that way and it\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s conditional love.\n\nI hesitate to say this, because she\u2019s not throwing a tantrum and I don\u2019t want you to run with that as language against her, but I want to lay out that example. When your child is crying and can\u2019t speak, do you say well until you can tell me what\u2019s wrong no love for you? If you do, that\u2019s wrong. You love them first because they don\u2019t know how to soothe this pain and you help them through it even though it\u2019s hard for you. It\u2019s hard to deal with unintelligible crying but that\u2019s part of parenthood. We are raising and training humans so we can\u2019t expect the reactions of trained humans from them.\n\nYou need to love your child out of this pain and that includes Frank. Of course, he can only become her dad so much as she lets him but to just be a good male figure in her life who loves her and pays attention to her is enough.\n\nShe\u2019s felt deprived for years now. Shes trained to feel love is conditional it sounds like so she has to be \u201ctrained\u201d out of it through experience. She\u2019s bitter and it\u2019s understandable. You two need to hug her until the screaming stops in this scenario like you would if she couldn\u2019t speak. That love isn\u2019t supposed to go away. She\u2019s an adult but she\u2019s going through pain and needs grace.\n\nShe also doesn\u2019t trust either of you it sounds like to me. One or likely both need to actually prove the love first and then she\u2019ll be more cheerful about it. You want the result before giving the work that provides that result. That\u2019s just what being a parent is - work with no reward lol.\n\nIt isn\u2019t true, there is a reward if you stick with it, but I understand how that feels outside of parenting so I get why it\u2019s hard.\n\nWe don\u2019t typically go places we feel unwanted. But she feels unwanted, too, and who\u2019s unwantedness matters more to be catered to? Hers. Her wantedness will provide yours, naturally.\n\nShe needs to see that you really love her and aren\u2019t doing it to get anything. Even though in a way you would be; to get a better relationship with her. But if it feels to just get her to shut up about her pain she will not be receptive. She needs proof that you\u2019ll play through this pain like a parent is supposed to and build that trust.\n\nAfter that you all can have a much more even relationship but you let it become unbalanced first. You\u2019re the parent and this is your responsibility. You did not do your best as a mom if you relinquish any responsibility.\n\nWe all make mistakes. But parenthood is for life. Good parents don\u2019t let go of the reigns and say I did all I can. I mean maybe with some things but never with Love!\n\nIf she refuses to talk sit there with her. Hug her if she\u2019ll let you. Enjoy the silence or even get her to go somewhere pretty where you can look at art or flowers, or some thing more specific relating to your daughter and her interests, and sit in silence. If she speaks don\u2019t give her any lip or excuses. Stop defending yourself and really hear her.\n\nShe\u2019ll start to see. Cause why do we hang around people who don\u2019t want to talk to us? Selfish people don\u2019t do that. They say whatever to it usually. I need to be wanted otherwise I\u2019m out. If you act out of selflessness and are always present it\u2019s going to confuse her but in a good way.\n\nShe might think, this is confusing and strange\u2026 why would someone hang out with me to not have fun, to not get to talk to me, and even let me be a little mean to them\u2026 people don\u2019t act like that unless they\u2026 love someone?\n\nIt\u2019s like those scenes in movies where the hysterical person is grieving over the loss of a loved one and their death, is throwing swings and people hug them until they melt into tears and holds them. I\u2019m not saying let people hit you, it\u2019s just a familiar trope you might have seen before that I think demonstrates exactly what I mean. Hurt people hurt people, as they say.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it can be that simple but maybe it can. Give it a try OP", "And I thought my mother was a monster. YTA.", "YTA", "YTA.

But it always means being present and trying to understand what our kids might be feeling.\n\nYour daughter is feeling replaced because you replaced her.", "YTA\n\nYour job as a parent was first and foremost to care for your child... Sandra. You failed. \n\nInstead you chose to date, have a romance, get married, and have four more children.\n\nYes, being a single parent is difficult. Yes it sucks to have to \"put your life on hold\" until your children are grown. But that is what you do. After my divorce, I didn't consider a serious relationship until after the kids were out of the house - they were my top priority. \n\nYou are, by your own words, abusive (emotionally and mentally) towards Sandra.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI, a 40 year old, had my first daughter, I'll call her Sandra, she's 20 years old, with my boyfriend George, who is now 50 years old. When Sandra was 5, I realized that George was abusive so I broke up with him. He didn't have an interest in maintaining a relationship with Sandra or I so I effectively became a single mother and raised Sandra on my own for the next 6 years.\n\nThen, when Sandra was 11 and I was 31, I met a man I'll call Frank, who was 33. We got married a year later and started having children, Sandra's step-siblings, the year after that. Now I am 40, Frank is 42, Sandra's 20, I have a son who I'll call Francis who's 7 years old, twins named Philip and Julia who are 5 years old, and a daughter named Stacey who's 3 years old.\n\nSince Francis was born, Sandra's been complaining to me about how she feels pushed to the side. For the first few months of his life, I can admit that she was somewhat pushed to the side, but that was because he was a baby with health complications and she was a 13 year old who required a lot less intensive attention. Then, when Francis's health got better, I was able to split my time more evenly between the two, but it was never enough for Sandra.\n\nWe've tried family therapy, but Sandra refused to talk. I've tried doing things alone with Sandra but she says she's jealous of her step-siblings who have two parents while she only has one, and, even then, my time is divided. I told her I'm sorry about her jealousy but Frank's a nice man, and the only reason why she feels disconnected from him is because she's being bratty about the changes.\n\nSandra has done nothing but complain about how the younger children are getting more attention than her, and I'm not entertaining that dialogue anymore. Since Philip and Julia were born, I've been telling her that it's her own fault she's not agreeable enough for anybody to spend any time with her, and she's had 6 years alone with me--that should be enough. Sandra responded by getting more and more withdrawn. She was awarded a full scholarship to college and is now two years into it. Since she's started college she's barely come home and, when she does interact with the family, she's been sullen and rude.\n\nI did my best as a mother. I'm sorry she didn't like it. I've still got a family who appreciates me, after all, so I told her that she's the problem because everybody else can get along just fine.\n\nBut I figured that I would check with all of you, to maybe understand her perspective better. She's told me about this part of Reddit and how it's good for questions. So AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Don\u2019t be surprised when she just stops coming \u201chome\u201d and I use the term home loosely because a home should be somewhere a child feels loved, wanted and safe and it\u2019s clear you didn\u2019t provide that for your eldest child!", "YTA\u2026 she was mature and self aware enough to share her legitimate feelings with you of feeling replaced and instead of reassuring her that she wasn\u2019t, you double down. You are incredibly lucky she maintained her self awareness, did well in high school, and is now in college. Your basic foundation had been good or she could be on a much different path right now. You can fix this! Be earnest, honest, realize where you went wrong and admit it to her.", "Mild YTA for the you had 6 years and that's enough comment to your daughter, ages 0-6 barely count as we can't remember most of those times. However it seems what your daughter wants is a time machine to go back and be raised as an only child, so she isn't blameless in this either. I'm sorry therapy didn't work, maybe time away or apart can help her let go of some of the anger she has, but at this point she has to want to change and it would appear she isn't ready to yet.\n\nInfo: you mentioned she said she only had one parent, did her step-father treat her very differently than his bio kids, or did she just not consider him dad because he wasn't her bio dad?", "Not enough information. Parenting is hard, being a child is hard. Does she have friends and a social life at school and away from home?", "YTA", "ESH. You sound fairly dismissive of your daughter, OP. But perhaps you're just tired of the whining. Your dismissiveness sounds like it's coming from you being exhausted about her attitude and the situation. She sounds resentful of her \"new\" family and her siblings and while her feelings are valid because those are her feelings, she is also an adult now and can choose whether she continues to whine about only having 1 parent or whether she wants to just enjoy what she does indeed have. I get it - it sucks when your parent bails on you like her dad did. But she doesn't have to wallow in it.", "You're a fucking weirdo.", "NAH George was abusive to one or both of you which effected her and then she had a single mom for the next six years. George skipped out and I would imagine financial assistance from him for your daughter was nothing.  I'm guessing like most single parent households you ad to work, there were financial struggles, and you had to make sacrifices to support your daughter which probably took time away from her. I would imagine when you got home from work, you were tired after a long day and had to do housework, etc.... Which means less time spent with your daughter.   \n\n\nYears later, you have Frank. Someone who is around to share the load. Your daughter sees this and she sees a different version of the mother she wished she had. She envies her siblings because they get a different version of you, less stressed, someone who has more time to spend with them and dote on them. Something she probably understands why it was different from her, but it still hurts because that little girl still exists in her and she can never change the past and get that back with her mom or a dad who basically rejected her.  \n\n\nPut yourself in her shoes for a moment. Live her life in your mind and imagine it through her eyes and how it felt, and what she sees. Try to be more compassionate and understanding. Maybe try to spend more one on one time with her.... build that mother daughter bond. Set aside some time for her and nurture that little girl inside her. She needs you.", "ESH\n\nYou all sound super bitter at each other and you need to be the more mature one and figure out how to spread your love and time evenly.", "YTA", "You failed Sandra, and you deserve all the hate from her. YTA.", "NTA, a lot of these responses are too harsh based off of the information we have. It\u2019s unreasonable to expect someone not to remarry and have more children after leaving their first born\u2019s other parent. If OP truly does everything to include her and daughter is just mad over jealousy of other siblings being born and then having two parents, how do you fix that? OP says she has tried to include her, has done therapy, and she doesn\u2019t seem interested. It seems the only thing that would have helped daughter was for OP to stay single or not have anymore children which is unreasonable.", "NTA.   Your daughter sounds immature.  I can understand your frustration.  Obviously you should still work to put the relationship back together but only if she is willing to participate.  My sister and I are 9 years apart in age.   My parents (especially my dad) favored her as a young child and spoiled her rotten.  I felt unloved most of my teen age years but you know what?  I got over it and when I was in my twenties my dad made it clear how much he loved me.  He has issues due to his upbringing and had problems with showing affection.  I forgave him.  Plus I also looked back over the years and thought about the other ways he showed me he loved me.  \nHopefully your daughter will also grow up or get some therapy to realize she\u2019s looking at it all wrong.  Just because you have little children that need you more right now doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t love her.   I wish you both the best.  Don\u2019t let your heart harden towards her too much.", "NTA - she was a 13 yo when you had another baby with health complications, even that was old enough to understand her role in the family was to welcome the new addition.  Having silent treatment at 20 means this behavior seems well entrenched. She should learn to be a part of a family dynamic or risk her half siblings going no contact at some point.  It's not to late to learn to build connections with them. You can be upset and angry your mother married at 11 during a challenging time, but it was your life choice to make, not hers. As long as he doesn't treat her badly and it doesn't seem that's the issue here,  it's on her to end this years long tantrum.

I can recognize that creating a blended family can be difficult, but you basically told your own daughter that it\u2019s her own fault that no one likes her.  And you say you\u2019ve been doing that since the twins were born, so you\u2019ve been saying that to your daughter for 5 years, since she was 15?  She started out with an abusive Dad, then no Dad, and now she\u2019s been having to deal with new siblings, who WILL divide your attention despite your best efforts.  She\u2019s much older than her siblings, so it might be more difficult for her to bond with them.  And I\u2019m curious - as the oldest child, did she have to look after her siblings?  Did family outings revolve around the younger kids?  Was Sandra expected to always give in to what her siblings wanted because she is older and more mature?  I\u2019m not saying this is necessarily the case, but it sometimes happens with much older siblings and can be a source of resentment.\n\nYou haven\u2019t really given us any solid info about anything Sandra had actually done to make you so fed up.  You say she complains, and lately she\u2019s withdrawn from the family and been sullen and rude - well, of course she\u2019s withdrawn, you told her all the family problems are her own fault!

Instead, you are getting defensive about her feelings.", "YTA. I can see why she barely spends time with you. You probably don't have to worry about this much longer because when she is financially secure with her own job and place, she will most likely go NC with you, especially if she finds a partner with a family who loves her.", "NTA. Your kid has big time resentment issues due to her not having 2 parents it sounds like and is blaming you for it in a way.\n\nShe probably needs therapy. Actual therapy. Not go for a session or two and then quit.", "So since the twins were born 5 years ago, when Sandra was 15, you\u2019ve been telling her it\u2019s her own fault no one wants to spend time with her? And you say that \u201csix years is enough\u201d time with you? How incredibly selfish. She had the courage to express to you how she felt, that she needed her mother and instead of finding more time to spend with her, perhaps spending a weekend with her doing things she likes and telling her you will always love her no matter what and maybe apologizing that there aren\u2019t enough hours in the day but that you will do your best and ask that she continue to be honest and open with you about how she feels, you just push her to the side? \n\nHave you ever considered she might have some lingering feelings about Frank? You seem to leave a lot of information out here, like what is Frank and Sandra\u2019s relationship like? How was she feeling with you getting married when she was still young and having a bunch of kids right away? Did you ask her anything about her feelings in the years between meeting Frank and now? Did you make space for her in your new family? Or was she pushed aside then, too? Did you ever talk to her or make space for her to talk about any memories she might have of her father? \n\nYTA. You had a kid under difficult circumstances at a young age and now that you have your happy second chance, you\u2019re pushing your first kid to the side. She will likely go no contact soon.", "YTA because it sounds like you've washed your hands of making an effort with your relationship because she's older and you've got little ones to focus on now. That shouldn't be the case. If anything your two's relationship should be the strongest of the lot as you've had more time together. Mother and child bond doesn't end once they've grown up. She obviously doesn't feel that way but you don't wish to address why that may be. If it started when she was 13, an important time in a girls life as she goes through puberty, hormones, school stress, boys etc. then she probably still feels resentful and insecure that you weren't there for her.", "YTA Are you gonna measure the time with your other children as well and one day say \"You've had enough. Now leave me alone with your feelings.\" \n\nBut honestly, do you love your child? I was sympathetic with you cause you two have a difficult past, but in order to heal you need to check your attitude first. That \"6 years\" sentence alone tells me your daughter probably had a reason to feel like she didn't get the unconditional love a mother is supposed to give. Now you're even considering to abandon her and you still struggle to understand your daughter's perspective? And the part with \"Well I have my other family, so whatever.\"... Is it normal to you that parents abandon their children without an ounce of guilt? You seem so emotionally distant while you're talking about losing your child.", "YTA. You\u2019re mad about how she turned out, but you\u2019re the one who raised her and she is still your kid. This is on YOU to fix, not on your adult child who is very much still trying to find her way in the world. She doesn\u2019t talk in therapy because you clearly do not listen to her and can\u2019t admit to your mistakes as a parent.", "Your other children arent sandra's *step-siblings,* they are her half siblings. I went through this same situation with my mother, and it never changed. I was not a difficult child, But it ended with me having a personality disorder and cPTSD because of my mother. Maybe it is Sandra being difficult, but maybe it IS you. Honestly, there is not enough here for me to make a decision on, but the way you tell the story makes me feel like there is just more to it and that you ignored your daughter more than you want to admit because she isnt the child of your new husband.\n\nETA: If sandra ends up with PTSD or some other trauma related disorder, it is all on YOU, and YOU are the one who made her this way. You do not get to call her difficult and tell her that no one likes her and it is HER fault, when in fact, it is all YOUR fault. You are the one who traumatized her and molded her into the person she is today.", "YTA. So much here to unpack. Years of abuse, years of trauma and neglect. I hope your daughter finds a supportive community of friends to form a family of choice and that she utilizes her school's wellness services. To be clear,  YTA because you have been a terrible mother to her, not just because of what you said this one time.", "YTA. Poor Sarah. At 13, she really needed you, but you failed her.

The issue is your words to your daughter. Granted the words were truthful but hurtful. And perhaps that makes you the AH. Wording may have been better.\n\nHowever people are quick to dismiss what the daughter had done. Idk how you integrated the family and what not, but your daughter made her own choice to be excluded from the family. You can say she was a child but at 13 you have a good idea what you are doing. You said you tried multiple things to try and connect but she refuses. There's a point where people need see that perhaps it's the other side is the issue. If you are calling someone and the other person refuses to pick up the phone, the person calling can't be too blamed for not communicating if the other person chooses not to answer.\n\nEdit: grammer", "YTA reading posts like this reminds me of my own mother and how she continues to disappoint me.", "As an older child with much younger half siblings, you were completely awful to your daughter. If I had to guess she was also treated completely different than the her half siblings, I bet there\u2019s a lot of double standards in place. Things that they can get away with she never could? I bet your husband has also never treated her like she was a daughter and was probably quick to discipline her in the name of respect! I bet you also dropped anything you were doing with her when one of your new family called for something. I bet you also missed out in any activities she was in that would require you to come out and watch because that would mean you would either have to get a sitter or bring the little ones and that\u2019s way to much work. But you don\u2019t remember these things now because she stopped asking since she knew you wouldn\u2019t go. Funny enough my mom thought just like you that it didn\u2019t matter because she had her younger kid who still wanted her around after my older and I stopped telling her things, we\u2019ll jokes on her my 3 younger siblings can\u2019t stand her 98% of the time also.

I don't like to think about it and I have acted really defensively and said a lot of cruel things.\"  You did push her to the side by your own admission and it sounds like you stabbed her in the heart during a very very very vulnerable time as a teenager, when they are by development pretty unlikable for a variety of reasons but desperately craving love and attention.

It sucks because I still want my own mother to want to make those changes for me too, but I cannot acknowledge them without risking what the kid has now.

My 2 cents is that your biggest mistake was choosing to have a child with George.  But I can't even really blame you for that.

There is no way a man can enter the life of an 11-year old young woman who has been, until then, an only child with a single mother, and effectively become a step-father for her.  He can be a friend, a helpful and supportive adult presence, etc., but there isn't a path for him to become a father.\n\nSo that means that, by default, Sandra will be somewhat of an outcast step-sister, as she describes.  And since this began just as she entered into puberty and adolescence, this will essentially define her self-image.  I can understand why she is resentful, sullen, and rude.  Anybody in Sandra's position would be.\n\nYou aren't at fault for that.  You made what sound like good choices, and probably tried your best.  You probably feel hurt and belittled by Sandra's anger and resentment.\n\nHowever, end of the day, it is the role of the adult to be the bigger person.  To turn the other cheek.  Suck it up.  Remind Sandra every day that she is loved, that she is lovable, and that your arms are open and ready to embrace her if/when she wants this.  She is and always will be your daughter.  \n\n\nTo that end, you were wrong to tell Sandra that she is the problem.  That was a fail as a mother.  Each of us is to a great degree the product of our circumstances.  Your poor choices in a mate resulted in Sandra being born into very difficult circumstances.  In fact, it is your fault, not Sandra's, that Sandra feels the way she feels.  You need to own that.  You can't change it, but you can and should offer unconditional love to your daughter.\n\nBottom line, I don't think either of you is an asshole.  Rather, you're two humans, imperfect and flawed like all humans, trying to find a path forward through difficult circumstances.

Unless OP introduced Sandra and Frank dangerously early in the relationship, it's very possible Sandra had only met him once or twice before they were engaged.\n* When Sandra was 13, Francis was born with health complications that meant he got (and possibly needed) more attention.\n* OP says that once Francis was getting better, OP was more able to divide the time between both children more equally.\n* OP was pregnant again less than 2 years later, and had twins by the time Francis was 2 and Sandra was 15.\n* From the moment the twins were born, OP began telling Sandra that it's her own fault no one wants to spend time with her\".\n\n\nWhat we don't know:\n\n* If Sandra ever got given any kind of solo therapy to deal with an abusive parent, or any therapy at all prior to becoming disagreeable in OP's eyes.\n* How long it took before Francis was well enough that OP was able to \"divide attention more equally\".\n* Just how severe the difference in attention was.  We've seen posts on here about parental alienation due to sibling health that vary from \"we were at hospital a lot but tried to make sure our other kids got solo time with us when possible\" to \"the healthy sibling was dumped with grandparents for a decade with near-zero visitation from parents\" and the difference between those two covers a lot of ground on TA judgements.\n* Who exactly the \"everyone\" OP refers to is when saying that \"everybody else gets along fine\".  Because if OP means that her new husband and the 3 kids who are a, very young and b, have never known *any other family norm* then that's pretty telling on it's own.\n* Exactly what kind of relationship Sandra has with OP's new husband, or how/if he tried to bond with her, which will all absolutely impact a teenager's feelings of abandonment and need for more secure attention.\n\nEither way, we know that at most OP had 2 years of Sandra being unhappy with a new situation before basically telling her that she's unlikeable and that's why OP doesn't want to spend any time with her.  Sandra had all these changes happen - new man in the house, then THREE new siblings including one with health issues - right in the peak years of puberty and hormones and sullen teen emotions.  OP had one brief period of difficulty right at the peak of all of this and, when Sandra was 15, had basically already written her off.\n\nAnd then is surprised that Sandra, now a legal adult, is choosing not to maintain a close relationship to a household of 5 people, only 1 of which it sounds like she ever wanted to be close to.\n\nI'm not going to deny that it must have been really hard for OP to go through an abusive relationship, or to deal with an infant with health complications.

It's so hard to look at yourself, and all I can do is try to guide her to make good decisions.  Her and I went to counseling together and separately so that she was free to talk without me there. There are certainly days she is not my favorite person, but I would never tell her that. We include all the kids in our day to day lives. We also try to have alone time with them.

They didn't have a parent who was able to do that for them. They likely have a history of childhood trauma. This is how they are protecting themselves emotionally, by turning inward. They are emotionally stuck. Children need a caregiver to co-regulate their emotions and to feel safe. Mom is still an emotional child who can't see her child's experience and needs. Mom blames her child for the discord and a very normal teen reaction to having a history of abuse and being forced to adjust to a new family.

What's his role as a father and a stepfather? Why didn't he step up when OP didn't?", "That\u2019s a good point, but I think where OP went wrong wasn\u2019t in being busy with a child when they were a newborn to the detriment of an older child, the wrong is how she handled the problems that arose from the hurt that brought to OP\u2019s daughter", "I'm not saying op isn't being abusive to her daughter. Absolutely she is. \n\nI don't hear intentional cruelty from OP's post, though.

Absolutely yes. Unfortunately not all adults are capable of it. My parents certainly were not and I am getting the impression OP isn't either. \n\nSomeone doesn't have to be cartoonishly evil to be an abusive parent. OP is certainly abusive to Sandra. And, I think, it's a byproduct of immaturity as opposed to intentionality on OP's part. OP actually reminds me a lot of my father and my sister - neither of whom are intentionally harmful. Both of them are unwilling to take into account the other person's perspective in a disagreement, are incapable of being accountable for anything, and are extremely volatile when they get threatened. \n\nAs for whether OP is loving, I'm not making a judgement on that, I'm speculating about whether they're acting intentionally cruel or reacting emotionally - and I stand by my read that OP is reacting instead of acting.", "Dude- the \u201cI did my best\u201d line made me see red- after A LOT of therapy I finally got the courage & the language to tell my father how his actions had deeply hurt me (I was about 30 at the time of this convo) all I wanted was for him to consider what I was saying & apologize.
