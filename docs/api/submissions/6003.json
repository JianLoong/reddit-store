{"id": 6003, "submission_id": "zz11xg", "title": "AITA For Telling My Daughter That She's The Reason Why Nobody Likes Her?", "selftext": "I, a 40 year old, had my first daughter, I'll call her Sandra, she's 20 years old, with my boyfriend George, who is now 50 years old. When Sandra was 5, I realized that George was abusive so I broke up with him. He didn't have an interest in maintaining a relationship with Sandra or I so I effectively became a single mother and raised Sandra on my own for the next 6 years.\n\nThen, when Sandra was 11 and I was 31, I met a man I'll call Frank, who was 33. We got married a year later and started having children, Sandra's step-siblings, the year after that. Now I am 40, Frank is 42, Sandra's 20, I have a son who I'll call Francis who's 7 years old, twins named Philip and Julia who are 5 years old, and a daughter named Stacey who's 3 years old.\n\nSince Francis was born, Sandra's been complaining to me about how she feels pushed to the side. For the first few months of his life, I can admit that she was somewhat pushed to the side, but that was because he was a baby with health complications and she was a 13 year old who required a lot less intensive attention. Then, when Francis's health got better, I was able to split my time more evenly between the two, but it was never enough for Sandra.\n\nWe've tried family therapy, but Sandra refused to talk. I've tried doing things alone with Sandra but she says she's jealous of her half-siblings who have two parents while she only has one, and, even then, my time is divided. I told her I'm sorry about her jealousy but Frank's a nice man, and the only reason why she feels disconnected from him is because she's being bratty about the changes.\n\nSandra has done nothing but complain about how the younger children are getting more attention than her, and I'm not entertaining that dialogue anymore. Since Philip and Julia were born, I've been telling her that it's her own fault she's not agreeable enough for anybody to spend any time with her, and she's had 6 years alone with me--that should be enough. Sandra responded by getting more and more withdrawn. She was awarded a full scholarship to college and is now two years into it. Since she's started college she's barely come home and, when she does interact with the family, she's been sullen and rude.\n\nI did my best as a mother. I'm sorry she didn't like it. I've still got a family who appreciates me, after all, so I told her that she's the problem because everybody else can get along just fine.\n\nBut I figured that I would check with all of you, to maybe understand her perspective better. She's told me about this part of Reddit and how it's good for questions. So AITA?\n\nEdit: When I say that Sandra had 6 years with me, I meant from the ages of 6 to 11. I was not including the ages of 0 to 5 when she was alone with George and I.\n\nEdit II: Half-siblings I know!

This is something you NEVER SAY to your child. 6 years is enough? What? Sounds like you truly pushed your daughter to the side and when she (rightly) got upset you just blamed it on her being upset. Have fun being no or low contact with your daughter.", "YTA. \n\nYou have to be a parent her whole life not until something new comes along or until she is 13. \n\nI\u2019m going to be upfront and tell you that you will affect her relationships for the rest of her life. She was abandoned by her father and then effectively abandoned by her mother. \n\nDon\u2019t be surprised when she runs into the arms of any one that shows her care or attention, no matter how toxic, because you denied her that during formative years. Beyond that I\u2019d wager that abandonment issues will be very strong. Imagine a romantic partner or friend tries to go separate ways from her, how she will deal with that knowing that her parents abandoned her and now seemingly everyone does. \n\nYou have failed your daughter. \u201cShe had six years alone with me\u2014that should be enough\u201d. \n\nYou are the asshole dude.

How on earth could you say that to your own daughter? The callousness involved in saying something like to your own flesh and blood, and one who has had to suffer a lot of change beggars belief. You need to go think long and hard about things and try to be a nicer human.", "YTA This is your daughter, and even from this post, it's clear you favor the other kids. \"Six years is enough\"? What does that mean? She's desperately trying to communicate emotional needs to her one and only mother, and all you do is insult and demean her.\n\nYou need counseling yourself so you can get over whatever feelings you have here. If you don't change, she is probably better off cutting you off and finding people who actually treat her with love. I hope you fix things before it comes to that.", "YTA. Calling Sandra a brat won't help solve the conflict.", "YTA. She was the only child for 13 years and had all the attention so for it to suddenly switch would\u2019ve  been hard for her.

I've still got a family who appreciates me, after all, so I told her that she's the problem because everybody else can get along just fine.\n\nThis right here is exactly why YTA, OP. This attitude of \"it is what it is\"  is what your daughter has seen growing up with you. She needed you to be there for her when she was going through a lot, and you didn't even attempt to go the extra mile, let alone the extra centimeter. You basically told her to deal with what you were willing to offer in terms of being a mother, and it's no wonder that she has rejected it.", "Yeah, I think YTA, but we would need to know more about how, exactly, you prepared Sandra for the rush of changes that you forced into her life. Reading your second paragraph, I knew this was going to be about Sandra (rightfully!) feeling tossed to the side.\n\nShe had already been abandoned by her father, who had been abusive prior to the abandonment. You were all she had for 11 years, then suddenly you met a new partner and within two years already had another child with him. At the beginning of her teen years, when she's already going through the changes and challenges of puberty, she suddenly found herself backburnered in her only parent's new life.\n\nHonestly, at some point she's going to have to get her head on straight and move forward with her own life. If she doesn't that's on her. Healing ourselves is part of becoming an adult. BUT, you own the mistakes you made during her formative years and I don't see any regret or taking ownership in your post at all. Without you taking responsibility for your mistakes, I'm afraid she's unlikely to warm back up to you.\n\n*Since she's been 15 you have been telling her that its her own fault she's not agreeable enough for anyone to want to spend time with her*?? How is that a thing any mother says to a 15 year old to feels pushed aside within her own home??\n\nThe way I see it, you made poor choices throughout her life, and you've done very little to mitigate the effects those choices have had on her. You chose a terrible father for her, then you bubbled with her for 6 years creating codependency, then you got married and pregnant within about a year of meeting someone new (presumably without engaging with any family counselling prior to that change, since you don't mention it until later), then you call her bratty and blame her for acting exactly like the sullen teenager one would expect in this situation.\n\nYou really skunked it with her.", "Found another future complainer about being abandoned by her adult children.", "YTA- you were your daughter\u2019s only reliable parent in an abusive household and you were all she had when you left him. It\u2019s natural for first born children to feel sidelined because of siblings, but it sounds like both you and your husband are so focused on your own little family that you forgot she was part of it. A full scholarship is a huge accomplishment and the fact that she is distant is because you have made her feel like an outcast in her home. Look at your actions and realize that she is your family. You may feel appreciated by the rest of your family, but who appreciates her. Also the fact that you told her that no one likes her is so messed up. She deserves so much more than that.", "YTA.\n\nI'm sorry OP, but that's just the case.\n\nYour daughter has told you that she's feeling pushed to the side, and jealous, because she only had 1 parent.\n\nAnd your only reaction, in the end, towards your daughter whom was left behind by her father, is to... Leave her behind.\n\nAnd you wonder *why* she's bitter?\n\nDo everyone a favor and apologize to your daughter. However, I'm not sure this relationship can be saved. If it can, it'll take a lot of efforts from all parties involved.", "YTA. You've been telling your daughter she's the problem since she was a kid. Your \"best\" is not good enough. Hopefully you have learned from your mistakes and your poor choices, and do not repeat this horrible behaviour with your other children, because no child deserves to hear their parents say the things you've said to Sandra.", "YTA\n\nEven though there is a lot of information missing, I've made the determination because this comment speaks volumes.\n\n>I've been telling her that it's her own fault she's not agreeable enough for anybody to spend any time with her, and she's had 6 years alone with me--that should be enough.\n\nIf this is your response to your own child who was abused by her father and her mother cast her aside for a new child with health issues, then I think she has a point and you're twisting this story to make her seem bad. I get it, not every parent is perfect, but you don't say that you spent her first 6 years alone with her and that's \"enough\". What a stupid and heartless thing to say. It all but confirms to your daughter that you are more the issue with her ostracization than her behavior. \n\nHer behavior is a reaction to **you** and **your behavior** raising her. You even admit that you did \"somewhat\" cast her aside when Francis was born and she complained about it. You admit that, and you pretend that going back to splitting that time more evenly afterwards is suddenly a fix to that issue. By your own admission, she was abused by her father and her mother cast her aside for a new family. That's bound to affect her in profound ways, because she grew up with that knowledge and your callousness, lack of awareness, and quite frankly, selfishness doesn't help mend that bond to make it functional.", "YTA. unbelievable. Your own daughter told you point blank what the issu was (which is rare).. vulnerably honest. and your reaction is \"psh she had six years with me already whats the big deal\". I feel bad for her.", "YTA for this: *\"Since Philip and Julia were born, I've been telling her that it's her own fault she's not agreeable enough for anybody to spend any time with her, and she's had 6 years alone with me--that should be enough.\"*\n\nSo you told a 15 year old that she is not agreeable enough for anybody to want to spend time with her. That is a major dick move. I was told that all the time by my mother because was very introverted and neurodivergent. Guess who only sees me very sporadically? \n\nAlso that fact that you think that 6 years being an only child (with 5 of those years being in a household with an abusive adult in it, regardless whether or not he was only abusive to you, children pick up on that shit) is enough and that she should be able to handle the transition to a blended family seamlessly. Even adult children have difficulties becoming a part of a blended family, let alone a child.", "YTA for the way you said things to your daughter. You are clearly not seeing her point of view & dismissing it.", ">I've been telling her that it's her own fault she's not agreeable enough for anybody to spend any time with her, and she's had 6 years alone with me--that should be enough.\n\n>I did my best as a mother.

I've still got a family who appreciates me, after all, so I told her that she's the problem because everybody else can get along just fine.\n\nJust when i was thinking that its just a normal mom not understanding her YA child you had to pull this shit.\n\nYTA \n\nShe must feel that you are forgetting her for your nice new family who gets along perfectly with each other and she is right. She is your child, you are her mother; it was your duty to make sure she adjusts to the changes and feels loved and included instead of telling her that she's the reason nobody likes her.\n\nWell you should wonder the reason why she doesn't like you and your family.", "YTA. I understand your daughter\u2019s point of view but you don\u2019t seem to.\n\nHer bio dad rejected her but that was OK because mom loved her and took care of her.  Then some guy starts taking up mom\u2019s time, then a year later they are getting married and before she has time to adjust to that pop-pop-pop come the new kids.  There\u2019s no way your daughter had a fair share of attention after you met your now husband.  New romances take attention and dedicated time to nurture, planning weddings takes a lot of time, preparing for babies takes time and once those babies are here it is all about them.\n\nIs it that hard to see why she feels you abandoned her like her dad did?  The teenage years are important and when she needed a mother\u2019s guidance you (by your own admission) were focused on your new family.  \n\nWhen you say family therapy do you mean just you and your daughter or have you dragged your husband into it too?  If he\u2019s there that is likely why she\u2019s not engaging.  You shifting your priorities away from her all started with his arrival.  This is something only you and she can mend.  After that, the rest should start falling into place.", ">she's had 6 years alone with me--that should be enough\n\nI'm sorry, what?\n\nRegardless of the circumstances of their birth, if you accept your role as a parent to a child, then it is for LIFE. You don't get to just throw them to one side once you get a perfect \"do over\" family and say \"well we had our fun but my new family is more important\".\n\nWas she acting bratty? Maybe, but she was a teenager! All teens are moody and hormonal and a little selfish. More importantly, she was a traumatised teen. She was abandoned by an abusive father. That will always cut deep. And once her siblings were born, she clearly felt abandoned all over again. Like she didn't matter anymore. \n\nLook, I am sorry you were trapped in an abusive relationship, and I'm sorry if your son was born with health complications, but your daughter was clearly going through a lot of trauma as a teen and you're acting like she deserved it because she wouldn't play happy families. Even now you're basically saying \"Well I'm happy and appreciated, so who cares how she feels?\"\n\nBeing a parent means sacrifice, it means support, it means always being there even if your kid is lashing out.

You have tossed the inconvenient first kid aside in order to have your picture perfect new do-over family. \n\nYTA", "So you've been telling her it's her fault nobody likes her when she's not \"agreeable\" enough when she was 15 after pushing ger to the side for mist of the rest of her puberty..

Accept that responsibility and you may yet be able to salvage your relationship with your eldest\u2026.assuming, of course, you\u2019re not simply looking for an excuse to write her off.\n\nYTA and I cannot help but wonder if the reason Sandra never spoke during therapy was because she knew you weren\u2019t actually listening.", "Okay.\n\nWow.\n\nSo when she was 11, which is already a tumultuous enough age, you met your husband. Cool, it's entirely reasonable that you find someone to love and have some kids with. That's fine. But in the space of only two years, she loses the only person she's had all her life. At 13, due to reasons beyond your control, she loses you even more to her little brother.  He's a poorly baby, so he gets 99% of your attention, which is honestly understandable. But he gets better and soon you can split your time, which was most likely 30-70 in the baby's favour because of the fact he's a baby and you probably didn't want to leave him alone, even with his father for too long. But the 30% you gave your daughter was not often spent just the two of you, was it? She probably had about 2% of your undivided attention before the other three were born.\n\nYou set time aside for her and it was shared with her little brother. That is on you. You lied to your daughter repeatedly about giving her quality time. After a period of time in which she was seeing her mom stressed out, was probably feeling scared herself because 13 is plenty old enough to know what's going on, and was still trying to adjust to her new life. She was on her own at 13 years old. It wasn't entirely your fault, you can't help that your son was ill and it was awful for you, I get it. But I don't think you thought for a second how everything affected your daughter. And you call her bratty for effectively losing her mother? For trying to tell you how she feels? That is so sad. Your poor kid. Did you never consider her once?\n\nAnd to make matters worse, you told her no one in the family liked her. How painful to hear. From the one person who is supposed to love you, the one person who is supposed to be there for you.

I now have a demanding 2 year old, and yes my eldest does not require the same quantity of time as my youngest, she does need quality time with me. My partner makes every effort to ensure she is included in everything too. I schedule 1:1 time with her - she loves musical theatre so we go to shows on the west end together regularly (we live just outside London so is easy to both embrace her passion). We plan weekends around her when she is with us. When I am doing something with her younger sister I always ask if she wants to come (50% of the time she comes to the park with us).

She was a child and had no part in your failed relationship or your decision to build a new family around her. You are human, and humans are pretty selfish. You are not really owning the fact that you've done harm to her. Instead, you are telling her to \"get over it\" without fully acknowledging the validity of her perspective. \n\nShe's going to be ultimately responsible for repairing the damage you've done because we are each responsible to own our own health and happiness. That includes healing after people have hurt us. Her pain is not invalid, and she's not the cause of this problem because she's suffering. \n\nI wish you were not compounding the problem by telling her she's to blame.

When Sandra was 5, I realized that George was abusive so I broke up with him. He didn't have an interest in maintaining a relationship with Sandra or I so I effectively became a single mother and raised Sandra on my own for the next 6 years.\n\nThen, when Sandra was 11 and I was 31, I met a man I'll call Frank, who was 33. We got married a year later and started having children, Sandra's step-siblings, the year after that. Now I am 40, Frank is 42, Sandra's 20, I have a son who I'll call Francis who's 7 years old, twins named Philip and Julia who are 5 years old, and a daughter named Stacey who's 3 years old.\n\nSince Francis was born, Sandra's been complaining to me about how she feels pushed to the side. For the first few months of his life, I can admit that she was somewhat pushed to the side, but that was because he was a baby with health complications and she was a 13 year old who required a lot less intensive attention. Then, when Francis's health got better, I was able to split my time more evenly between the two, but it was never enough for Sandra.\n\nWe've tried family therapy, but Sandra refused to talk. I've tried doing things alone with Sandra but she says she's jealous of her step-siblings who have two parents while she only has one, and, even then, my time is divided. I told her I'm sorry about her jealousy but Frank's a nice man, and the only reason why she feels disconnected from him is because she's being bratty about the changes.\n\nSandra has done nothing but complain about how the younger children are getting more attention than her, and I'm not entertaining that dialogue anymore. Since Philip and Julia were born, I've been telling her that it's her own fault she's not agreeable enough for anybody to spend any time with her, and she's had 6 years alone with me--that should be enough. Sandra responded by getting more and more withdrawn. She was awarded a full scholarship to college and is now two years into it. Since she's started college she's barely come home and, when she does interact with the family, she's been sullen and rude.\n\nI did my best as a mother. I'm sorry she didn't like it. I've still got a family who appreciates me, after all, so I told her that she's the problem because everybody else can get along just fine.\n\nBut I figured that I would check with all of you, to maybe understand her perspective better. She's told me about this part of Reddit and how it's good for questions. So AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

However it seems what your daughter wants is a time machine to go back and be raised as an only child, so she isn't blameless in this either. I'm sorry therapy didn't work, maybe time away or apart can help her let go of some of the anger she has, but at this point she has to want to change and it would appear she isn't ready to yet.\n\nInfo: you mentioned she said she only had one parent, did her step-father treat her very differently than his bio kids, or did she just not consider him dad because he wasn't her bio dad?", "Not enough information.

George skipped out and I would imagine financial assistance from him for your daughter was nothing.

I would imagine when you got home from work, you were tired after a long day and had to do housework, etc.... Which means less time spent with your daughter.   \n\n\nYears later, you have Frank. Someone who is around to share the load. Your daughter sees this and she sees a different version of the mother she wished she had. She envies her siblings because they get a different version of you, less stressed, someone who has more time to spend with them and dote on them. Something she probably understands why it was different from her, but it still hurts because that little girl still exists in her and she can never change the past and get that back with her mom or a dad who basically rejected her.  \n\n\nPut yourself in her shoes for a moment. Live her life in your mind and imagine it through her eyes and how it felt, and what she sees. Try to be more compassionate and understanding.

I got over it and when I was in my twenties my dad made it clear how much he loved me.  He has issues due to his upbringing and had problems with showing affection.  I forgave him.  Plus I also looked back over the years and thought about the other ways he showed me he loved me.  \nHopefully your daughter will also grow up or get some therapy to realize she\u2019s looking at it all wrong.

I bet your husband has also never treated her like she was a daughter and was probably quick to discipline her in the name of respect! I bet you also dropped anything you were doing with her when one of your new family called for something. I bet you also missed out in any activities she was in that would require you to come out and watch because that would mean you would either have to get a sitter or bring the little ones and that\u2019s way to much work.

Even says Sandra refuses to talk during the sessions they tried. The mother did nothing wrong and, from what's said, has actively tried to fix the relationship.\n\nThe daughter is 100% being a brat and holding a grudge for no reason other than because she can't figure out how to deal with her issues.", "HARD Y T A you mean? telling your 15 year old that she is at fault for her mother having too many children to be able to spend any time with her and that noone likes her. That is what is called a dick move and she has prob lost contact with her daughter for the foreseeable future. I sure as hell would have gone no contact", "She basically meant that I'm her only parent because George didn't want to be in her life and she didn't consider Frank a parent because he's not related to her. That was part of me stating that it's her fault she's so isolated--Frank has spent time with her and is willing to be part of her life, but she repeatedly pushes him and our children away.", "See but even without that information\u2026 she started telling her daughter at only 15 years old that no one wanted to be around her because she wasn\u2019t good enough\u2026 a child that was feeling abandoned and alone already", "I agree, but perception is reality. Sandra could be experiencing some pretty significant depression due to all these life changes that were brushed aside. Individual therapy should have been done moreso than family therapy.", "As far as she's told me she does. She loves college.", "I was leaning towards maybe a N A H or soft Y TA until she started telling her daughter she was essentially a burden and unwanted at only 15 all the way till now. She has spent 5 years telling her that no one wants to be around her and it\u2019s all her fault\u2026 I can imagine that she has internalized that at this point and might even think that she drove her bio dad to not want her", "This is a really bad take. \n\nHer child was likely traumatised from her previous relationship, and then ignored as soon as OP had another kid. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault that her second child has complex medical needs, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can just ignore your existing child - a 13 year old has significant emotional needs which, as OP noted, went unmet. \n\nIn addition to having a child with medical issues and a teenager from a previous abusive relationship, and not enough time or energy to parent both children, OP then chooses to get pregnant, add twins to the mix (not her fault admittedly), and then get pregnant *again*. \n\nOP is hugely irresponsible, emotionally neglectful toward her daughter, open about not considering her first child her \u2018family\u2019, blames her child for her own failure as a parent and is then\u2026 Surprised when her child decides to distance herself? I mean, at this point OP isn\u2019t simply an AH, she\u2019s delusional.", "How?", "Fruedian slip maybe...but not an outright error on your part.  You come across as viewing your younger children as seperate from your oldest...which led to this mess.  Pretty sure Sarah is going to go NC first chance she gets....you should be thrilled.", "To be clear, it was an error in perspective not a typo.\n\nYTA", "I agree that Sandra is probably as level headed as anyone in this situation could be, but this sort of parenting leaves its scars. I think what I meant by that is that eventually she will have to deal with those scars in some manner.", "I know, it was wild reading that. I don't fault her daughter at all for how she feels. The mother is a monster honestly, and Sandra is completely justified in how she feels. The OOP needs therapy and a big fucking dose of reality that she is, in fact, not a good mother and likely shouldn't have had that many kids if she can't reasonably give them the attention they need growing up.", "Let alone, the daughter actually *telling her flat out what the problem is/was.* I mean, that\u2019s like the easiest thing to combat when you have a kid who is openly sharing their feelings. All OP had to do was **actually listen**", "Maybe it's because you told her your new family doesn't like her?? Wtf.", "Well, you\u2019ve been telling her she\u2019s unpleasant to be around and no one likes her for\u2026.how many years now? How else to you expect her to react?\n\nCareful, OP, it almost sounds like you\u2019ve been trying to push Sandra out if your family. If we can see that after a single post, Sandra has most definitely picked up on it. Perhaps the other children have as well. You are not as subtle as you think you are.", "That\u2019s good. Have you visited her at college at all? Did you have much time together just the 2 of you once her half siblings started to arrive? She was a child who was used to having your undivided attention so would have been important to her to still have some of that. Appreciate it\u2019s really difficult sometimes, but she probably feels like her stepdad and siblings stole that time (and you) from her and still needs that reassurance.\n\n(Good that he makes the effort, not that she pushes him away btw)", "Well technically OP has 4 more tries at being a good parent. Hopefully she can figure it out by the time the last one runs away.", "When I wrote this judgment, I thought it might be criticized for being too harsh. I was somewhat relieved about the state of humanity to look back and see the number of similar judgments.", "That's what you choose to respond to?\n\nYikes\n\nWhen your eldest cuts all contact with you, you will only have yourself to blame.\n\nYou consistently failed her as a mother, and still continue to do so.\n\nYTA", "Lol have a reread of your post I think you'll find a few more errors you should be apologising for", "Yep four you love and one you tolerate. Great example of parental love right here. YTA in case the others comment haven't been clear.", "Well as long as you're happy OP /s", "How is that the only thing you took away from that comment???", "You neglected her daughter and now blame her for you pointing out the neglect.  You showed your daughter you didn't care enough about her.  Somehow my Dad and stepmom always found time to spend with me and my three younger half siblings, through serious medical emergencies with siblings, dad working long hours, and young toddlers running around the house.  You straight up admitted you emotionally neglected your daughter when she was 13.  She'd already been abused and abandoned by her dad and now while going through puberty and middle/high school at a time when kids often need their parents the most, you neglected her.  Then after spending months or years neglecting her you went on to have three more kids while she was in high school so you had very little to no time for her.  You DID push her aside and you continue to do so.  Mom of the year you are not", "Well yeah after you made the first miserable, I\u2019m sure you are happy", "I bet you are satisfied with Sandra\u2019s replacements. You need psychiatric help", "4, right? Your oldest doesn\u2019t count", "Which is TOO MANY", "Stop being obtuse. You know exactly what they mean.", "i think its clear enough to op why the comment is worded as it is considering how op has tried to spin the content in her favor. Speaking of that YTA op you seem to have become less of a good mother the more children you had. Then you continued having more.", "Will you accept the verdict or you will only argue with people?", "Frank is your husband. Not her new father. It\u2019s so weird to me that people think they can simply replace parents, because they picked a crap on the first time around. That is not how that works. \n\nAny relationship that your daughter wanted to have a Frank should\u2019ve develop organically, and should have been which she felt most comfortable with. \n\nNot twoAdults determining the terms of the relationship, and the child falling in line. That is irrational, cruel, and just bad parenting. **So no, it doesn\u2019t seem like your daughter intentionally isolated herself, it seems like your lack of respect for the boundary of not wanting Frank to be her father is the reason that you are so perturbed and are fine essentially kicking her out of your family.**\n\nAnd I\u2019m no expert, but that sounds like absolutely terrible parenting.", "Yeah your daughter is the AH for doing that, she wants a reality that can never be (just you and her) and until she adjusts her expectations she is going to be unhappy. Sadly if she doesn't see this is really a her issue and not a you issue she may go NC with you at some point.", "The OP's dislike and lack of concern transpires quite well throughout her post.", "Because there are people there who actually love and care about her there", "Ah ok. Yes, Sandra may want to do individual therapy at some point, but OP should NOT be the one to suggest it. I think her way to deal with those scars is to prevent new ones by going no contact and then finding her people who see her for her and not whatever warped fantasy OP had envisioned for her.", "Responds to that because fakery called out", "Nobody has to accept the parent's new partner as their parent. Just because OP chose this guy, it doesn't mean her daughter has to treat him like a father figure. He's not her dad.\n\nI didn't hear that the daughter wanted it to be just the two of them, only that she feels abandoned and that OP has a preference for her 'new' family. OP doesn't exactly dispell this notion in the comments.", "Exactly right.  \n\n(and I love your username! I've been saying that for YEARS! haha)", "Omg you\u2019re right with the user name.  He\u2019s off his rocker man!"]}
