I'm living and working in Germany for a fixed period on secondment. While here, I became quite friendly with a colleague, 60F, and she invited me to her daughter's wedding. I was excited as I've never been to a white wedding. I asked if there was a dress code/colour scheme to adhere to since it wasn't specified on the invite. I was told the code is \"dress to impress\". Bet. \n\nDay of the wedding, I understand the assignment. I wear my traditional wear, which is really beautiful and obviously not German. The garment is green, so np problem there. Or so I thought. I get a lot of questions and compliments at the wedding, which I genuinely downplay because its not my day. \n\nMy colleague seems colder than usual but I pay it no mind since she's mother of bride and could be preoccupied. The bride is downright rude to me, but again i give her grace. I congratulate her and thank her for including me and I get a tight \ud83d\ude10 in response. \n\nI keep to the edges of the room as the music isn't really my vibe, and I'm just observing how European weddings work. I leave around 8 (after 5 hours) and go home before the wedding finishes. \n\nMonday I walked into whispers in the office, people actually strangely and more reserved than usual. An office friend pulls me aside and fills me in: brides mother is fuming. My outfit was too extravagant, OTT and inappropriate. I drew attention from the bride and commandeered the room: I was rude and disrespectful. She's told people all about it, apparently. \n\nI approach MOB and ask to speak but she says she has nothing to say to me. I ask her why she has sth tk say everyone else about me but not to me, and she calls me an insolent child. I explain to anyone who scolds me that this was my first white people wedding: I specifically asked what to do wear and followed the guidelines. Where I'm from, there's no such thing as outshines g the bride - weddings are a fashion show and a chance to wear your best and brightest clothes. They told me this isn't africa (which was racially coded) nd people here have manners. I laughed and told that person to go to hell, so she's telling people I lack remorse for my behaviour. \n\nI'm wondering if I really am the asshole though?", "created_utc": 1698233153, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17g2iv7/aita_for_outshining_the_bride/", "score": 270, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not gonna touch the Africa comment (as a fellow Black woman with African family, I REALLY want to fixate in that).

Malaysian) weddings I've been to. \n\nI can't speak for Germany but neither could you, that's why you asked.\n\nI don't usually jump to jealously, but they were *clearly* jealous and they're being wildly immature about it. And racist.", "NTA. That said, I am from Germany and you probably would have \"stolen the show\" in a much simpler dress, just for being a black person. Look, I am from rural south Germany. I went to Florida at the age 32 and that was when I saw a black person face to face for the first time in my life. Could have been the same for some people in that wedding. Of COURSE that is no excuse, just more of an explanation that you probably would have not won this either way.", "NTA\n\n>I was told the code is \"dress to impress\".

I was so focused on my excitement about getting married that I couldn\u2019t tell you what literally anyone at my wedding was wearing without consulting pictures. Even if a bride notices someone wearing something truly over the top, I can\u2019t imagine it being deeper than a flicker of annoyance. Literally no one is focused on anyone other than the people getting married; it\u2019s all about them, for gods sake. I\u2019ve been at weddings where someone was wearing what can only be described as a wedding dress. Was side eye present? Were jokes made, including after the fact? Yes. Did it ruin the couple\u2019s day? No, because they were otherwise occupied (obviously). They were focused on being happy to get married, not focused on EVERYONE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT MEEEEE. \n\nAnyway. I digress. I\u2019m going with NTA considering that what you were wearing was culturally appropriate for a wedding. \n\nAgain, it\u2019s just so weird that the MOB is carrying this bitterness and anger like this.", "NTA. Sounds like the bride was just jealous because you looked great!", "NTA. To be honest, I suspect that with OP saying \"traditional wear\", it will be slightly different to European dull wedding attire (OP even says that where she's from, it's about wearing your best and brightest). She probably drew attention due to it being different and they're calling *that* outshining the bride. Well, in my book, outshining is something else entirely.  \n\n\nI am curious about OP's dress though, mostly because I love seeing non-western(ized) stuff. I don't give a hoot about westernized weddings nor their style, but I saw some pictures of a (rich people) Tanzanian wedding once and that was gorgeous. Hell, some photographer should make a coffee table book about wedding attire across the world.", "NTA at all, there is a strong scent of racism behind this whole incident.

What type of dress was it?", "INFO: Could we get a pic of the dress?", "NTA\n\nThis completely on the mother. She told you dress to impress and you did! Plus, she knows you are from a different culture, she could have spent 5 mins asking you what is normal for a wedding for you and asked to see your outfit. I suppose you could have sent her a pic beforehand, but as she didn't ask she didn't get.\n\nThe only 'rule' in white weddings is don't wear white! Sounds like you have a few gossips at work, and people LOVE a wedding with drama, even if they have to invent drama themselves.", "It feels weird that you were even invited.\n\nBut once you were invited, there should have been more communication about the outfit, especially given the cultural difference: You can't expect or be expected to adhere to cultural expectations when you aren't integral part of the culture.", "Nta.

What you describe and reactions don\u2019t match so perhaps what you consider dress to impress means something different than they expected.  I\u2019m guessing by a \u201cwhite\u201c wedding you found something traditional and while nice, a bit boring. \n\nI\u2019ve seen impressive wedding attire from several areas (India, Africa, Asia) and they would be much brighter and more flamboyant than traditional European or American wedding attire.

Very odd! Not surprised the bride was pissed.", "NTA\n\nI'll tell you why she has nothing to say to you: she is too much of a coward to address the problem directly and she perfectly knows that she would make a fool of herself for coming out about the real reason why she's angry, so she prefers to play the stupid little backstabbing games she's used to, which allow her to just deliver whatever story she wants to her peers and never be accountable for what she says. \n\nJust ignore her. I think she has shown enough about herself at this point. No need to risk to let her pull you on her level. Moreover, did her daughter say something?

You asked for the dress code, and you did nothing wrong but be your beautiful self, show up and dress for the occasion. \n\n**NTA.**", "NTA, Im assuming she knows youre from Africa? African weddings or even Indian weddings are all about being in your best from what Ive seen, a chance for everyone to be beautiful. However, I doubt you were actually competing with her, is there any chance you were the only person who wasnt white?

If you are stupid enough to set the dresscode as \u201ddress to impress\u201d you deserve guests that are absolutely smashing it. Real dresscodes exist for a reason. Use them to avoid uncomfortable situations for both hosts and guests.", "Info - this one is too subjective. If you truly did wear an outfit that was over the top, can kind of make you an AH. Without seeing the outfit, I dont know if this can truly be judged, but its likely you\u2019re not the AH.", "NTA you adhered to everything you needed to adhere to! You dressed to impress, you didn't wear white, you didn't draw unnecessary attention to yourself at the wedding. How is it your fault that you are beautiful and a fashionista? The bride and MOB are jealous and ruined the day for themselves - what does it matter if some people at the wedding commented on your outfit?\n\n There is no outshining the bride - you could disrespect the bride by wearing white/a wedding dress but there is no outshining the bride. Her happiness should depend on her spending time with people who want to make her feel special because of the union she is creating with her spouse.", "NTA. Germany is not a country that's known for its fashionate citizens and even a more formal dresscode is often very modest. But how would you know that? Also, 'dress to impress' literally asks for an outfit like yours. Only because Germans, especially older generations, hardly dress up, the dress code cannot be understood any different from what you understood. It sounds like the motto from a family with a sense for style, and you dressed up as suggested. It's completely MOB's fault. 'We have manners' is the most stupid response one could give regarding the situation. Wtf. So sorry you were in that situation. I often wish Germans would be more open to more outgoing fashion, they are so boring in that respect.\n\nP.S.: I went to a wedding in Germany, we were told to dress nicely, but casual. Wore a jumpsuit I would wear for a dinner in one of my favorite, casual restaurants. Partner had a button shirt and we both took care of our hair / my makeup. It's how we go to dinner. Turns out, that was overdressed... traditional German parties are very very casual. A jumpsuit or nice pants with a plain blouse, or a summer dress usually work perfectly fine. I tend to send pictures of my outfits in advance, though, then I can be sure.", "NTA - traditional dress is always acceptable at a wedding especially if told to \u201cdress to impress\u201d it\u2019s not your fault the bride was a plain Jane!", "I\u2019ve been to a few white (ie European) weddings with one or two people in traditional \u201cAfrican\u201d garb, and yes it does stand out, looks amazing, and no it\u2019s not a problem. \n\nNTA. Your German friend and her mother are insecure.", "NTA We had a Japanese guest at our wedding and she wore the most beautiful traditional kimono.

No such thing as outshining the bride.", "NTA - You followed the rules.", "NTA. You didn't wear white or black. You followed the rules. It's not your fault that the bride or her mother had expectations on the wedding attire. The way that your coworker scolded you was very uncalled for and racist.", "NTA. Only rule is you don't wear white. Dress sounds cool from your description.", "This one is sort of hard to judge without seeing your garment but I am still going to go with NTA. You've never been to a European wedding and it sounds like your colleague knew that. She could have said \"wear a formal dress that doesn't attract attention\" but she said \"dress to impress\" so you did. Traditional African formal wear is stunning. You looked good and the bride was insecure that someone she doesn't know looked amazing at her wedding. Your colleague is probably catching heat from her daughter for inviting you.

You don't get to be rude to others and try to paint them as the bad guy.", "You asked Al the right questions. Just because there is a break in how the two different cultures dress at weddings isn't your fault. You were told to dress for the occasion by the brides mother no less.

Next time you know to ask more questions to cater to their likes.", "Absolutely NTA and the weddings from your culture sound absolutely fabulous. Just think, no one worried about someone else upstaging them because everyone is confidently in their best and brightest. That just sounds beautiful.", "NTA.

Good for you for sticking up for yourself.", "NTA\n\nI do think this could have been avoided if you did more research into German weddings, that way it's less likely you would have misunderstood what \"dress to impress\" means in this context. HOWEVER. I fully understand why you wore what you wore and of course it's easy to say in hindsight that more communication should have happened.\n\nThey should have been more transparent and given an example of what to wear since they know you aren't used to German wedding customs. They also shouldn't have reacted all pissy and still being mad after the fact is also an overreaction.\nEVEN IF your clothes were more extravagant than what the bride was wearing, it's everybody's choice if they let you outshine her or not. They should've focused on her and either ignore your clothes or be happy that someone is sharing their culture with them.\n\nEven if what you did had been rude and inappropriate your co-worker has no right to react in this rude and frankly racist manner", "NTA because you were trying to follow the dress code. The problem is that \"dress to impress\" obviously had a different meaning to them. I'm guessing you aren't clueless, so you likely saw everyone else's outfits and likely new you were making a much bigger impression than anyone else. That's not your fault. I'm just pointing out that I can see why they probably didn't like it. I would say there were no assholes here, but they kind of took away that option because of how they treated you afterwards. If it was such a problem, your coworker should have come up to you and let you know it was an issue.\n\nI will say that I don't think \"this isn't Africa\" was coded. In this case, I think they were literally saying that they could see that it was normal attire for formal dress in your country, but it was not in Germany. I may be cutting them too much slack, but I've dealt with a lot of bigotry in my life and this, for some reason, doesn't feel like they were being prejudiced.", "NTA. They're all AHs.", "My fellow african woman.....\n\nNTA\n\nThey are just jelous because you look beautiful.....", "YTA would need to see the dress to really be sure, but honestly I wouldve probed deeper into what \"dress to impress\" meant since you have never gone to a \"white\" wedding, or maybe wouldve looked up what is polite or customary or expected in \"white\" weddings in order to not step on any toes. Weddings are universally very important and ceremonial so customs are always important to research when it comes to going to them especially for the first time.\n      Like when I look up what to wear for an african wedding it gives advice online, and based on that advice I would imagine I would get some judgmental stares if I showed up in what I would consider regular or formal wedding attire from my culture.", "ESH\n\nThem for being racist and not being clear in their instructions.

Also they could have been more gracious. \n\nYou - You could have looked up what \"white people weddings\" are like online - google, tv shows etc to find something that could still be \"dress to impress\" but not outshining the bride. Like, I get it, I'm indian - no such thing as outshining a bride in my culture too, it's a fashion show and everyone and their mother dresses in their fanciest clothes BUT if I'm going to a wedding that's not from my culture, I wouldn't wear a cultural dress unless specifically approved. You could have looked it up or asked a local friend if your outfit was appropriate. Hell, there's even a reddit community specifically for guest attire approval.

Should you have shown your friend/colleague a picture first? Perhaps but hindsight is 20/20 and not a fair way to evaluate actions\n\nBut I'll give the vote ESH cause it seems like you don't have actual regret of your mistaking the dress code.

Yes, it is extravagant compared to Western dress, but you meant no disrespect, in fact you were respecting the bride by wearing your best outfit.  NTA", "NTA\n\nNo one can outshine the bride. However, if you walk in fully naked you may get more attention. \n\nThe bride & her mother chose to be offended. They sound like miserable people & they ruined the party for themselves.", "NTA.

And you didn\u2019t actually outshine the bride\u2026 receiving compliments is one thing, but the bride is still the bride and presumably invited guests who love and support her.", "NTA \n\nI dislike this mentality of \u201coutshining the bride\u201d. No matter clothes, or accessories or whatever, the bride will never be outshined because everyone knows who\u2019s day it is! You can\u2019t say to guests to wear their best clothes and then be insulted when they do. I come from Eastern Europe but married in another European country and I told my guests and bridesmaids to dress to impress, and they did and it was fabulous. Had people wear traditional clothes as well, which made it even more amazing. People looked good, felt good and had a good time! Which meant even more to me and my husband.  \n\nNot to mention the racially changed comment was completely disgusting and disrespectful.", "Unless you wore a white wedding gown, you are NTA!", "ESH not every culture is like yours, you could have easily looked up what is appropriate to wear to a European wedding. It\u2019s also weird that you even went to a wedding of a person you did not know just because a coworker invited you. The mother was weird in inviting you I\u2019m guessing her daughter didn\u2019t even know. Co-workers are being dramatic this in no way affects them whatsoever", "NTA \n\nYou did absolutely nothing wrong, if the bride was jealous of you and that is her problem, obviously her mother is going to be on her side, but they are in the wrong. You probably just looked beautiful and she couldn\u2019t stand it.", "NTA.

I'm living and working in Germany for a fixed period on secondment. While here, I became quite friendly with a colleague, 60F, and she invited me to her daughter's wedding. I was excited as I've never been to a white wedding. I asked if there was a dress code/colour scheme to adhere to since it wasn't specified on the invite. I was told the code is \"dress to impress\". Bet. \n\nDay of the wedding, I understand the assignment. I wear my traditional wear, which is really beautiful and obviously not German. The garment is green, so np problem there. Or so I thought. I get a lot of questions and compliments at the wedding, which I genuinely downplay because its not my day. \n\nMy colleague seems colder than usual but I pay it no mind since she's mother of bride and could be preoccupied. The bride is downright rude to me, but again i give her grace. I congratulate her and thank her for including me and I get a tight \ud83d\ude10 in response. \n\nI keep to the edges of the room as the music isn't really my vibe, and I'm just observing how European weddings work. I leave around 8 (after 5 hours) and go home before the wedding finishes. \n\nMonday I walked into whispers in the office, people actually strangely and more reserved than usual. An office friend pulls me aside and fills me in: brides mother is fuming. My outfit was too extravagant, OTT and inappropriate. I drew attention from the bride and commandeered the room: I was rude and disrespectful. She's told people all about it, apparently. \n\nI approach MOB and ask to speak but she says she has nothing to say to me. I ask her why she has sth tk say everyone else about me but not to me, and she calls me an insolent child. I explain to anyone who scolds me that this was my first white people wedding: I specifically asked what to do wear and followed the guidelines. Where I'm from, there's no such thing as outshines g the bride - weddings are a fashion show and a chance to wear your best and brightest clothes. They told me this isn't africa (which was racially coded) nd people here have manners. I laughed and told that person to go to hell, so she's telling people I lack remorse for my behaviour. \n\nI'm wondering if I really am the asshole though?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
