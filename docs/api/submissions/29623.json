I'm living and working in Germany for a fixed period on secondment. While here, I became quite friendly with a colleague, 60F, and she invited me to her daughter's wedding. I was excited as I've never been to a white wedding. I asked if there was a dress code/colour scheme to adhere to since it wasn't specified on the invite. I was told the code is \"dress to impress\". Bet. \n\nDay of the wedding, I understand the assignment. I wear my traditional wear, which is really beautiful and obviously not German. The garment is green, so np problem there. Or so I thought. I get a lot of questions and compliments at the wedding, which I genuinely downplay because its not my day. \n\nMy colleague seems colder than usual but I pay it no mind since she's mother of bride and could be preoccupied. The bride is downright rude to me, but again i give her grace. I congratulate her and thank her for including me and I get a tight \ud83d\ude10 in response. \n\nI keep to the edges of the room as the music isn't really my vibe, and I'm just observing how European weddings work. I leave around 8 (after 5 hours) and go home before the wedding finishes. \n\nMonday I walked into whispers in the office, people actually strangely and more reserved than usual. An office friend pulls me aside and fills me in: brides mother is fuming. My outfit was too extravagant, OTT and inappropriate. I drew attention from the bride and commandeered the room: I was rude and disrespectful. She's told people all about it, apparently. \n\nI approach MOB and ask to speak but she says she has nothing to say to me. I ask her why she has sth tk say everyone else about me but not to me, and she calls me an insolent child. I explain to anyone who scolds me that this was my first white people wedding: I specifically asked what to do wear and followed the guidelines. Where I'm from, there's no such thing as outshines g the bride - weddings are a fashion show and a chance to wear your best and brightest clothes. They told me this isn't africa (which was racially coded) nd people here have manners. I laughed and told that person to go to hell, so she's telling people I lack remorse for my behaviour. \n\nI'm wondering if I really am the asshole though?\n\nEdit: the dress inspo I showed to my tailor is now on my profile to help you.

Not gonna touch the Africa comment (as a fellow Black woman with African family, I REALLY want to fixate in that).

I went to Florida at the age 32 and that was when I saw a black person face to face for the first time in my life. Could have been the same for some people in that wedding.

I was so focused on my excitement about getting married that I couldn\u2019t tell you what literally anyone at my wedding was wearing without consulting pictures. Even if a bride notices someone wearing something truly over the top, I can\u2019t imagine it being deeper than a flicker of annoyance. Literally no one is focused on anyone other than the people getting married; it\u2019s all about them, for gods sake. I\u2019ve been at weddings where someone was wearing what can only be described as a wedding dress. Was side eye present? Were jokes made, including after the fact? Yes. Did it ruin the couple\u2019s day? No, because they were otherwise occupied (obviously). They were focused on being happy to get married, not focused on EVERYONE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT MEEEEE. \n\nAnyway. I digress. I\u2019m going with NTA considering that what you were wearing was culturally appropriate for a wedding. \n\nAgain, it\u2019s just so weird that the MOB is carrying this bitterness and anger like this.", "NTA. Sounds like the bride was just jealous because you looked great!", "NTA. To be honest, I suspect that with OP saying \"traditional wear\", it will be slightly different to European dull wedding attire (OP even says that where she's from, it's about wearing your best and brightest). She probably drew attention due to it being different and they're calling *that* outshining the bride. Well, in my book, outshining is something else entirely.  \n\n\nI am curious about OP's dress though, mostly because I love seeing non-western(ized) stuff. I don't give a hoot about westernized weddings nor their style, but I saw some pictures of a (rich people) Tanzanian wedding once and that was gorgeous. Hell, some photographer should make a coffee table book about wedding attire across the world.", "NTA at all, there is a strong scent of racism behind this whole incident. Your co-worker is 100% the AH.", "I N F O: what type of dress was it? You mentioned the colour, but was it for instance a ball gown or something like that?

I suppose you could have sent her a pic beforehand, but as she didn't ask she didn't get.\n\nThe only 'rule' in white weddings is don't wear white! Sounds like you have a few gossips at work, and people LOVE a wedding with drama, even if they have to invent drama themselves.", "It feels weird that you were even invited.\n\nBut once you were invited, there should have been more communication about the outfit, especially given the cultural difference: You can't expect or be expected to adhere to cultural expectations when you aren't integral part of the culture.", "Nta.

What you describe and reactions don\u2019t match so perhaps what you consider dress to impress means something different than they expected.  I\u2019m guessing by a \u201cwhite\u201c wedding you found something traditional and while nice, a bit boring. \n\nI\u2019ve seen impressive wedding attire from several areas (India, Africa, Asia) and they would be much brighter and more flamboyant than traditional European or American wedding attire.

Very odd! Not surprised the bride was pissed.", "NTA\n\nI'll tell you why she has nothing to say to you: she is too much of a coward to address the problem directly and she perfectly knows that she would make a fool of herself for coming out about the real reason why she's angry, so she prefers to play the stupid little backstabbing games she's used to, which allow her to just deliver whatever story she wants to her peers and never be accountable for what she says. \n\nJust ignore her. I think she has shown enough about herself at this point. No need to risk to let her pull you on her level. Moreover, did her daughter say something?

African weddings or even Indian weddings are all about being in your best from what Ive seen, a chance for everyone to be beautiful. However, I doubt you were actually competing with her, is there any chance you were the only person who wasnt white?

Use them to avoid uncomfortable situations for both hosts and guests.", "NTA - love the dress (inspo)\n\n*Info - this one is too subjective.

Adding judgment!", "NTA you adhered to everything you needed to adhere to! You dressed to impress, you didn't wear white, you didn't draw unnecessary attention to yourself at the wedding. How is it your fault that you are beautiful and a fashionista? The bride and MOB are jealous and ruined the day for themselves - what does it matter if some people at the wedding commented on your outfit?\n\n There is no outshining the bride - you could disrespect the bride by wearing white/a wedding dress but there is no outshining the bride.

Germany is not a country that's known for its fashionate citizens and even a more formal dresscode is often very modest. But how would you know that? Also, 'dress to impress' literally asks for an outfit like yours. Only because Germans, especially older generations, hardly dress up, the dress code cannot be understood any different from what you understood. It sounds like the motto from a family with a sense for style, and you dressed up as suggested. It's completely MOB's fault. 'We have manners' is the most stupid response one could give regarding the situation. Wtf. So sorry you were in that situation. I often wish Germans would be more open to more outgoing fashion, they are so boring in that respect.\n\nP.S.: I went to a wedding in Germany, we were told to dress nicely, but casual. Wore a jumpsuit I would wear for a dinner in one of my favorite, casual restaurants. Partner had a button shirt and we both took care of our hair / my makeup. It's how we go to dinner. Turns out, that was overdressed... traditional German parties are very very casual. A jumpsuit or nice pants with a plain blouse, or a summer dress usually work perfectly fine. I tend to send pictures of my outfits in advance, though, then I can be sure.", "NTA - traditional dress is always acceptable at a wedding especially if told to \u201cdress to impress\u201d it\u2019s not your fault the bride was a plain Jane!", "I\u2019ve been to a few white (ie European) weddings with one or two people in traditional \u201cAfrican\u201d garb, and yes it does stand out, looks amazing, and no it\u2019s not a problem. \n\nNTA.

Only rule is you don't wear white. Dress sounds cool from your description.", "This one is sort of hard to judge without seeing your garment but I am still going to go with NTA. You've never been to a European wedding and it sounds like your colleague knew that. She could have said \"wear a formal dress that doesn't attract attention\" but she said \"dress to impress\" so you did. Traditional African formal wear is stunning.

Just because there is a break in how the two different cultures dress at weddings isn't your fault. You were told to dress for the occasion by the brides mother no less.

Next time you know to ask more questions to cater to their likes.", "Absolutely NTA and the weddings from your culture sound absolutely fabulous. Just think, no one worried about someone else upstaging them because everyone is confidently in their best and brightest. That just sounds beautiful.", "NTA.

Good for you for sticking up for yourself.", "NTA\n\nI do think this could have been avoided if you did more research into German weddings, that way it's less likely you would have misunderstood what \"dress to impress\" means in this context. HOWEVER. I fully understand why you wore what you wore and of course it's easy to say in hindsight that more communication should have happened.\n\nThey should have been more transparent and given an example of what to wear since they know you aren't used to German wedding customs. They also shouldn't have reacted all pissy and still being mad after the fact is also an overreaction.\nEVEN IF your clothes were more extravagant than what the bride was wearing, it's everybody's choice if they let you outshine her or not. They should've focused on her and either ignore your clothes or be happy that someone is sharing their culture with them.\n\nEven if what you did had been rude and inappropriate your co-worker has no right to react in this rude and frankly racist manner", "NTA because you were trying to follow the dress code. The problem is that \"dress to impress\" obviously had a different meaning to them. I'm guessing you aren't clueless, so you likely saw everyone else's outfits and likely new you were making a much bigger impression than anyone else. That's not your fault. I'm just pointing out that I can see why they probably didn't like it. I would say there were no assholes here, but they kind of took away that option because of how they treated you afterwards. If it was such a problem, your coworker should have come up to you and let you know it was an issue.\n\nI will say that I don't think \"this isn't Africa\" was coded. In this case, I think they were literally saying that they could see that it was normal attire for formal dress in your country, but it was not in Germany. I may be cutting them too much slack, but I've dealt with a lot of bigotry in my life and this, for some reason, doesn't feel like they were being prejudiced.", "NTA. They're all AHs.", "My fellow african woman.....\n\nNTA\n\nThey are just jelous because you look beautiful.....", "YTA would need to see the dress to really be sure, but honestly I wouldve probed deeper into what \"dress to impress\" meant since you have never gone to a \"white\" wedding, or maybe wouldve looked up what is polite or customary or expected in \"white\" weddings in order to not step on any toes. Weddings are universally very important and ceremonial so customs are always important to research when it comes to going to them especially for the first time.\n      Like when I look up what to wear for an african wedding it gives advice online, and based on that advice I would imagine I would get some judgmental stares if I showed up in what I would consider regular or formal wedding attire from my culture.", "ESH\n\nThem for being racist and not being clear in their instructions.

Like, I get it, I'm indian - no such thing as outshining a bride in my culture too, it's a fashion show and everyone and their mother dresses in their fanciest clothes BUT if I'm going to a wedding that's not from my culture, I wouldn't wear a cultural dress unless specifically approved. You could have looked it up or asked a local friend if your outfit was appropriate. Hell, there's even a reddit community specifically for guest attire approval.

No matter clothes, or accessories or whatever, the bride will never be outshined because everyone knows who\u2019s day it is!

I come from Eastern Europe but married in another European country and I told my guests and bridesmaids to dress to impress, and they did and it was fabulous.

I'm living and working in Germany for a fixed period on secondment. While here, I became quite friendly with a colleague, 60F, and she invited me to her daughter's wedding. I was excited as I've never been to a white wedding. I asked if there was a dress code/colour scheme to adhere to since it wasn't specified on the invite. I was told the code is \"dress to impress\". Bet. \n\nDay of the wedding, I understand the assignment. I wear my traditional wear, which is really beautiful and obviously not German. The garment is green, so np problem there. Or so I thought. I get a lot of questions and compliments at the wedding, which I genuinely downplay because its not my day. \n\nMy colleague seems colder than usual but I pay it no mind since she's mother of bride and could be preoccupied. The bride is downright rude to me, but again i give her grace. I congratulate her and thank her for including me and I get a tight \ud83d\ude10 in response. \n\nI keep to the edges of the room as the music isn't really my vibe, and I'm just observing how European weddings work. I leave around 8 (after 5 hours) and go home before the wedding finishes. \n\nMonday I walked into whispers in the office, people actually strangely and more reserved than usual. An office friend pulls me aside and fills me in: brides mother is fuming. My outfit was too extravagant, OTT and inappropriate. I drew attention from the bride and commandeered the room: I was rude and disrespectful. She's told people all about it, apparently. \n\nI approach MOB and ask to speak but she says she has nothing to say to me. I ask her why she has sth tk say everyone else about me but not to me, and she calls me an insolent child. I explain to anyone who scolds me that this was my first white people wedding: I specifically asked what to do wear and followed the guidelines. Where I'm from, there's no such thing as outshines g the bride - weddings are a fashion show and a chance to wear your best and brightest clothes. They told me this isn't africa (which was racially coded) nd people here have manners. I laughed and told that person to go to hell, so she's telling people I lack remorse for my behaviour. \n\nI'm wondering if I really am the asshole though?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The only rule is pretty much don't wear white or whatever color the bride will be wearing, other than that it's an opportunity for everyone to put on their absolute best clothes and have fun and no one cares what you're wearing because it's not your day, it's the brides. The bride can show up in jeans and a baggy t-shirt and it will still be her day and all the attention will still be on her (and the groom of course), so the concept of outshining the bride is just weird.

It seems nuts to me, but people on reddit act like it\u2019s totally normal to care (a lot) about how wedding guests dress. I don\u2019t get it, and I just hope people realize it\u2019s a relatively new thing they\u2019re going nuts over.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s also the blatant racism and xenophobia in this specific case, which OP recognized right away.", "NTA.

It looks like a gown a Western woman would wear to a big, formal, occasion like the Oscars. Given the benefit of the doubt, the bride and MOB may have perceived it as an attempt to overshine everyone which I've no doubt you did, you're incredibly beautiful. A quick explanation of it being your traditional wear should have made them instantly understand. Not your fault Africans dress more gloriously than westerners.\n\nWithout the benefit of the doubt, I'd say she wanted a pet black friend but only if they behave white.

They're missing out on the purpose of the day - which is for everyone to come together and celebrate the union of two people and two families.  It doesn't need to look like the perfect Disney fairy princess wedding.", "NTA. For what it's worth every wedding is different. I'm from the States and that dress would be right at home at a black tie wedding but a bit over dressed for a backyard ceremony. It's on them to convey the expectations.

Because I can't fathom this reaction at all.", "NTA because you quite literally asked her for guidance on the dress code and informed her clearly you haven\u2019t been to their style of wedding before. It\u2019s so absurd that she invited you, failed to prepare you, then gossiped about you to everyone as if it was solely your fault. \n\nWedding culture is so strange too.\n\nPlease go to HR or your company\u2019s equivalent to record the workplace discrimination she\u2019s causing for you as well as the racially coded comments.", "Nta. That is a very lovely dress. Not sure if it's a German thing, but by my US standards, you were in line with a dress code provided.", "That dress isn\u2019t even over the top. German sensitivities must be very fragile.", "NTA, they shouldn't say \"dress to impress\" and then get upset when somebody does, it's not like you wore white there. You tried apologizing but got shut down, that's on them. The mom should be ashamed of herself for being such a gossip and a racist one at that!", "NTA. They should have been clearer, and I think the MOB kinda sucks.", "Girl, that dress is fire. If I had a formal wedding in a luxury ballroom at the Ritz, and you arrived in that I would have loved it.

NTA", "Ok I just looked at the dress.  Absolutely stunning!  I would 100% wear this to a wedding! (from NYC, predominantly Irish American and Italian American neighborhoods).  Completely appropriate. I'm so curious now, as to what the other guests were wearing that would make this seem over the top???", "NTA! Co-worker was at fault here. She should have been more clear about dress code. As someone planning a wedding, I\u2019ve come to realize that the more details you provide about the overall vibe the better off you\u2019ll be. Also not worried about being \u201coutshined\u201d because I\u2019ll be in a fancy dress with my hair and makeup done and at a table for just the two of us so it\u2019s quite obvious who the bride is at 98% of weddings.", "I absolutely do not understand why the bride - ANY BRIDE - for that matter, would even feel they are being \"outshone\" by a guest.  The entire focus of the evening on the newly married couple.\n\nSo, you wore a fabulous outfit.  I think the best response from the MOB and bride could have been along the lines of:\n\nWow!  What a gorgeous outfit.  I take it this is a traditional dress?  Can you tell me more about it?  Then, I would have danced with you to celebrate the wonder of diversity and THANKED you for sharing the spirit of joy with my family and friends.\n\nIt is not like you wore a wedding dress - which is massively passive-aggressive, or made any major life announcement, pregnancy , engagement ...etc. \n\nHonestly, these people are massive jerks.  You asked for guidance, were told to dress to impress.  You did exactly that.  It was up to the bride and her family to understand, accept, embrace and celebrate the difference.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry but \"Dress to Impress\" was a terrible thing to tell you since you asked for a dress code. What they should have said was \"formal\". You did exactly as told, you dressed to impress. There is a code at white weddings that the bride is the star and you don't outshine her. (To the point you don't wear a white dress to compete with her).   \nBut tell you dress to impress implies the goal is to impress people, to get them to look at you.   \nI'm sorry, but they failed you in helping you understand the dress code. That's on them not you.", "NTA, but Take it as a compliment. Envy is is the most honest form of flattery", "NTA. If they wanted something specific, they should\u2019ve stated it.

It\u2019s beautiful yet far too extravagant by these wedding expectations. But that said, I don\u2019t know how you could prevented the initial situation: you\u2019re unfamiliar with the expectations of a German wedding, you stated as much to your coworker, and specifically asked her how extravagantly to dress. With the differing cultural contexts you were both working under, her answer is the equivalent of a person who can\u2019t handle more than a dab of sriracha telling a waiter at an Indian/Thai/[insert preferred cuisine here] restaurant \u201cI\u2019m great with spice, give me the hottest food you have!\u201d.\n\nThe misunderstanding could have been N A H, if your coworker had been an adult and simply talked to you at the wedding or afterwards.

At minimum, implying your lack of understanding is a moral failing or intentional insult to the bride is rude and beyond unfair. You showed up and dressed up like you thought you were expected to - by your intentions, you were showing respect to the bride and the wedding itself. \n\nNTA, you didn\u2019t mean to commit this faux pas and tried to avoid it, your coworker is now creating a hostile work environment instead of just talking with you.

My wedding was colorful because I love the vibrancy, joy and life colors bring. Because my family is the same way. It\u2019s the perfect time and place to wear an extravagant and vibrant dress.

I would have been delighted to have someone rocking a beautiful look from outside my own culture at my wedding!", "Because they probably paid for a set amount of people and then filled in the empty RSVPs. A guy I grew up with, one of my best friends, had his wife-to-be call me to invite me. It was the weirdest thing that ever happened. She straight up said \u201cwe had some nos on the RSVPs, we have an open spot for you if you\u2019d like to attend the wedding.\u201d I said I was busy that weekend and didn\u2019t attend because of how taken aback I was. Just for context, I knew I wasn\u2019t invited originally and could not and still to this day have no idea why. I see them at least 2-3 times per month for 7 years since and we\u2019ve never said a word about it.", "I attended a wedding last year where they had some cancellations which meant they were just under their minimum amount they had to pay the venue for.\n\nSince they could add about a half dozen guests for free they asked me and other friends if our parents wanted to pop buy for some free food and a party.\n\nIt's not completely outlandish.", "Wait wait WHAT a drive thru for BEER?!", "This is how my now husband and his ex girlfriend got invited to my first wedding\ud83d\ude05\nMy ex and I paid for a set amount of people and i got some last minute cancellations so I invited my new coworkers since I had the seats anyways.\nFun story now obviously", "This is a terrible story! I would die of curiosity not knowing why I wasn't initially invited to the wedding of a couple that I STILL see 2-3 times a month! Can I call them and ask? LOL", "No one likes to be someones backup guest or proverbial plan B.", "Yes \ud83e\udd23 VERY common thing here in Ohio. Do you know those self service car wash stations? Kinda like that where you drive your car through it (not like a fast food drive thru where you pull up to a window even though they have those, too) and the walls are lined with coolers of beer, wine, and malt drinks. Stuff you\u2019d find in the grocery store or gas stations, depending on where you live and the alcohol regulations.\n\nETA: Only other place I\u2019ve seen them is in Kentucky.", "You yadda yadda-ed over the best part!", "MAAM", "It truly was weird. We knew each other since we were 15 and for the wedding, we were in our mid-20s and had all been to a few other friends\u2019 weddings. I was 99.99% sure we were gonna get an initial invite and of course I would have been there. Nope. No invite but everyone else in the friend group got one and thought it was weird I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m not the type to get offended over anything and there was no type of any kind of fight or falling out. I was just curious until I got the phone call blatantly telling me I was on the B List so at *that* point I was just in shock and said I couldn\u2019t go (it was 3 weeks before the wedding). Well, they missed out on a gift of $750 because that was my standard gift for friends back then. And again, no mention of it after that phone call. Very very strange.", "We had a drive thru \u201cbeer barn\u201d in my Pop-Pop\u2019s tiny OK town", "We've got them in Florida.", "You just unlocked a childhood memory of driving through the red beer barn as a kid. This was the mid-late 70s in Texas. I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re still around though\u2026", "Jajajja not my intention! Ask away and I'll give you all the details", "One of them loathes you (or their family does).", "I\u2019m not sure why they\u2019re not everywhere. They\u2019re so convenient lol.", "Was the invitation part of the chain of events that led to your future husband becoming your now husband?", "They\u2019ve done a great job faking it, which is ok with me!"]}
