When I logged into the Google doc there was no work completed other than 2 data tables filled out which is just copying and pasting and takes 2 minutes to do, no introduction or conclusion written none of the questions answered.

I would also make sure your prof knows why her name isn't on your project.  You could just send your post because it explains everything.  I'm a prof and I've dealt with this numerous times.  I'm always shocked by the behavior of the person not doing any work.", "Fool me once, shame on thee. Fool me twice, shame on me. \n\nYou didnt let her fool you twice. Good for you. \n\nNTA", "Your NTA, but you are ignoring reality.\n\nLab partners are a requirement. The unfortunate truth is that we can't control our lab partners. We can't wish them into being more capable or more diligent.\n\nI found that I preferred a disinterested lab partner over an incapable one who insisted on contributing.\n\nIf your grades are important to you, then I would recommend changing your mindset and expectations.\n\nExpect to complete the lab report alone. If you happen to have a great lab partner, then you can count yourself as pleasantly surprised.\n\nOtherwise, ignore the bullshit and do what you need to do to get the grade that you want. \n\nPersonally, I didn't give a shit if I had to carry the load as long as I got the grade that I was aiming for. I wasn't interested in punishing my lab partner for failing to contribute because, in most cases, their work wasn't up to my standards.\n\nI much preferred that they just get out of my way and allow me to get us both the grade that I wanted.\n\nBut you do you.", "NTA.  She glommed onto you because you're an ambitious person who wants to do well and she saw an opportunity to slack.\n\nClassic FAFO.", "NTA. \n\nI have a tip for when you talk to your prof. There are three reasons that teachers get students to work in pairs. One is the cost of equipment. The second is the learning process - a good set of partners will help and teach each other. The third reason is that teachers simply want to do less work, by marking 20 lab reports instead of 40. Bear that in mind when you talk to your prof: he/she could be overworked, and you should offer a solution (a different partner), and show gratitude if they allow you to work separately.", "NTA. Notify your professor that your submitting your own lab.", "NTA \n\nTalk to your professors and tell them what is going on. Group projects are horrible and not worth the effort. \n\nOnce I was on holiday with two papers due. I stayed in the hotel room and got them finished. She's just lazy and using you.", "NTA, meet with your professor.  Bring the messages and the proof of what is going on.  It is still early in the term you may be able to get a new lab partner, or you may be able to go solo as you are already doing all of the work.", "NTA. You have to go to the professor and tell them everything. The thing about the uncle, Nashville\u2014all of it. She\u2019s extorting you into doing all the work.", "Her lab partner picked OP to be lazy, not do any work or belew the bare minimum and mooch good grades off of her. I hope OP puts her in her place and karma delivers. Play stupid games win stupid prizes.", "We can't control \"having\" a partner. We can control who they are. If OP has screen shot the snap chat, 99% of professors would allow her to change.", "You are missing the point of my comment.\n\nOP can get a new partner, but will they get a better partner?\n\nOP just might get a person who will struggle to produce C- work but still insists that they write half of the lab report.\n\nIs this better for OP? I would argue that it isn't.\n\nI found that it was easier to do the entire thing than it was to knife fight with a person who produces subpar bullshit.\n\nThis is just my take.", "Tell your professor yesterday. Even if it's just a letting them know you are going to keep at it but this is what's happening in case it gets worse(it will)", "NTA, but get your ducks in a row. She's a known liar at this point, so she will most likely lie to your professor about the quantity of work that she has done. Compile evidence (all correspondences, her text messages, the bar pictures, the google docs) and present these to your prof before she can spread her lies. Then ask to change partners, and if you can't, to do it alone.", "NTA. Why when I was in school I HATED group projects. If I was lucky I could get 1 MAYBE 2 others to help me with the work. Otherwise I would do it all because I wanted the good grade. The others would do nothing or bad work that needed to be redone. I just started asking the teacher if there was any way I could do a group project by myself.", "NTA I'd telling the prof you did the entire last one, too, and why. get her flunked.", "NTA you're nicer than me. I would have gone to the professor/TA", "Tbh, I loved group projects. Id pick the shyest kid in class and offer a trade. Theyd do a bit bigger share of the advance work (60:40, nothing wild here, folks) and Id do the full presentation except for the mandatory one slide or w/e.\n\nI don't mind public speaking, but I'm disorganized. So it'd work out for both of us. And, to prove I'm not T A, those kids would all come to ME for the next assignment happy with the division of labor and the better grade on the presentation portion.", "NTA\n\nBut...inform your professor of your lab partner's behavior and don't let her take credit.", "NTA.  This is the reason why I hated group projects at high school and university and why I never assigned them when I in turn became a teacher.  In my experience, at tertiary level, there's always one person who does the lion's share of the work, one person who helps but isn't as good, two people who do as little as possible and two people that you don't even meet until the project is due.  But be prepared for the fact that the teacher may not be sympathetic and tell you to just deal with it - that's what happened to me.", "There's a reason she insisted you to be her lab partner. So you could do her lab assignments.\n\nShe fooled you once, and that was more than enough.\n\nNTA", "NTA, and I'd bring up the lab work issues in the first incident up with the teacher. Using others to skate by on responsibilities and learning should have consequences.", "Nta", "NTA. Definitely talk to the professor. She will not have a problem screwing you over later. I was in a group project that lasted all semester long and the other 3 people in the group had been long time friends. I was the odd man out. We each had our part to do. We were supposed to show up to the meetings with our completed parts. I was the only one that did. Every meeting, I literally sat there for the 2 hours for them to complete there part before we could progress to the next section. They wasted so much of my time, and on top of that they gave me crappy peer reviews. Had to go talk to my professor and I broke down the parts I did. I showed him the text messages of planned meetings and then I showed him my saved documentation for each part I did on my laptop. I had emailed my part from my personal email to my college email. Because of the email it, my part was time stamped. I almost failed because of those people. So talk to your professor and never be in a group were they are friends before that class.", "NTA, but you need to cover your arse and document her being out drinking etc, and stating you will not do her work for her.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntalk to the professor, and hand in separate reports.", "NTA, and talk to the prof.", "I don\u2019t think group projects in school represent any actual\nCollaborations I have had to do minus one where I was told my idea was bad and then they freaking implemented it three months later.", "As the smart kid in school who could not publicly speak, you are the person I would have wanted to be paired with. In college one of my biggest high school bullies ended up in a class where we had to speak for our final. I had an entire breakdown during my presentation. I hate presenting because of that person, they always made me feel dumb for anything I said. In high school, I would always have my partner do the presentation and I would do the work. You\u2019re like a saving grace to group work and presentations.", "You are NTA. \n\nAs someone who has had terrible lab partners/group partners for projects, you went about it the right way. \n\nTalk/email (preferably email; get everything on paper) the instructor about switching groups, and highlight why you need to do so. \n\nAgain, you're NTA. Your \"lab partner\", or should I say parasite, is.", "NTA, I dunno how it is in your school but in mine they had a specific work around where you could credit yourself for the work you did in a group project so anyone who failed to do the work would get grades to reflect that, without bringing down the rest of the group. Definitely see if you have a similar option or talk to the school and don't agree to partner with this person again.", "Nta", "You should have talked to your teacher after the first time. You need to do it now", "i would talk to the TA about it.  part of the lab experience is working as a team, so any good TA worth their salt would find you a amiable solution (the lazy one will do nothing).  ask the TA if you can merge to another group", "Agreed. I\u2019ve always felt that because not everyone will be good at everything, finding a system or compromise like this that works for everyone and accomplishes the tasks required is one of the life skills that is supposed to be gained from these group projects.", "No, you are certainly not an AH.  /////////Do not allow someone to not participate and get credit for your work.  kt", "NTA.\n\nI was you in school/university. Bugged the hell out of me. Hated group work because of it."]}
