I would also make sure your prof knows why her name isn't on your project.  You could just send your post because it explains everything.  I'm a prof and I've dealt with this numerous times.

Good for you. \n\nNTA", "Your NTA, but you are ignoring reality.\n\nLab partners are a requirement. The unfortunate truth is that we can't control our lab partners. We can't wish them into being more capable or more diligent.\n\nI found that I preferred a disinterested lab partner over an incapable one who insisted on contributing.\n\nIf your grades are important to you, then I would recommend changing your mindset and expectations.\n\nExpect to complete the lab report alone. If you happen to have a great lab partner, then you can count yourself as pleasantly surprised.\n\nOtherwise, ignore the bullshit and do what you need to do to get the grade that you want. \n\nPersonally, I didn't give a shit if I had to carry the load as long as I got the grade that I was aiming for. I wasn't interested in punishing my lab partner for failing to contribute because, in most cases, their work wasn't up to my standards.\n\nI much preferred that they just get out of my way and allow me to get us both the grade that I wanted.\n\nBut you do you.", "NTA.  She glommed onto you because you're an ambitious person who wants to do well and she saw an opportunity to slack.\n\nClassic FAFO.", "NTA. \n\nI have a tip for when you talk to your prof. There are three reasons that teachers get students to work in pairs. One is the cost of equipment. The second is the learning process - a good set of partners will help and teach each other. The third reason is that teachers simply want to do less work, by marking 20 lab reports instead of 40. Bear that in mind when you talk to your prof: he/she could be overworked, and you should offer a solution (a different partner), and show gratitude if they allow you to work separately.", "NTA. Notify your professor that your submitting your own lab.", "NTA \n\nTalk to your professors and tell them what is going on. Group projects are horrible and not worth the effort. \n\nOnce I was on holiday with two papers due. I stayed in the hotel room and got them finished.

It is still early in the term you may be able to get a new lab partner, or you may be able to go solo as you are already doing all of the work.", "NTA. You have to go to the professor and tell them everything. The thing about the uncle, Nashville\u2014all of it.

If OP has screen shot the snap chat, 99% of professors would allow her to change.", "You are missing the point of my comment.\n\nOP can get a new partner, but will they get a better partner?\n\nOP just might get a person who will struggle to produce C- work but still insists that they write half of the lab report.\n\nIs this better for OP? I would argue that it isn't.\n\nI found that it was easier to do the entire thing than it was to knife fight with a person who produces subpar bullshit.\n\nThis is just my take."]}
