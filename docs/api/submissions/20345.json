If you have to give someone something else to do at an event, they should not be at that event.", "ESH\nShe should have said no kids 13 and under. But clearly, the point of the rule was to eliminate kids who would need care and oversight, and your son needs those things.", "I lean to YTA. No kids under 10 implies exactly what your sister said. She only wanted kids that can take care of themselves. She probably assumed you where on the same page.", "You know that your son is developmentally not 10 years old, despite his actual age.

The point of the no kids things is that they don't want disruptions or children that have to be catered to. The fact that she didn't even bring her own children is proof of that.

If someone brought a 35 year old man with the mental capacity of a 2 year old who has tantrums, I'm sure that the no child rule would also apply. \n\nIn the future, she will just make sure to exclude you and your family.

You know your child lacks a maturity level to match his age yet you brought him anyway. \n\nYou should have gotten a sitter and left him at home. If that was impossible you should have worked with your sister on a plan to keep him in another location in the building during the ceremony to avoid the possibility of him causing a disruption. \n\nYou are used to how he acts and it doesn't phase you, but I'm sure his outburst, no matter how brief, was magnified in the quietness of the ceremony. You were very inconsiderate.", "This depends on the invitation and RSVP. Was your child included on the invitation? Did you include him in the RSVP? If his name was on the invitation then your NTA.

You brought entertainment for this very reason. In most circumstances, this would be viewed as good, proactive parenting and you would be commended. However, based on my own tendencies, in this situation, my suspicion is you purposefully disregarded the spirit of your sisters request. Was it malicious or just inconsiderate? Who knows other than you and your sister? Was this revenge from a slight from years ago? Who knows other than you and your sister. \n\nShould she have been more explicit? Sure, but that would force her to be TAH leading up to her wedding day. Was it really necessary?

That's why he planned ahead. Op is the asshole.\n\n\nSidenote: there are two main reasons why adults will exclude kids from important events. #1 they don't want the disruptions that kids inevitably bring. Anyone who has spent time with children knows that you are driving a hard bargain to get them to sit quietly and listen to speeches they give 0 fucks about for 30+ minutes. #2 people are planning to cut loose, get drunk,  and don't want kids around while they are getting their party on.

It was about the bride and groom and they deserved to have their ceremony without interruptions.

And while our Chinese friends only invited family for the ceremony, they never excluded small relatives. \n\nSo yeah, for you to not want your kids on your very special day is...puzzling (I would hire a babysitter to help for the day, just for them to be there.

We got married at a winery that had lots of irreplaceable antiques as decorations and we would be up for costs if they were damaged or broken so we didn't want to risk it with 20 odd kids there too", "Because most kids age 11 and up are capable of sitting through a wedding, and there might be a number of guests between age 11-14 who she wanted to invite including nieces, nephews, cousins, and children of close friends. It\u2019s her wedding. OP should have been more considerate and actually thought about the purpose for the restriction.", "Maybe there were 13 year olds she wanted there? Maybe she realized that there's a considerable difference between a 6 year old and a 12 year old?\n\n>What do you even mean \u201cwhat was she supposed to do\u201d\n\nThe other commentor mentioned that the bride should have set \"better rules.\"  What better rules would they want to see? Even if the bride called OP up to specifically tell him not to bring his son, we'd just be reading an \"AITA\" for not going to a wedding after my son was not invited.\"", "Parent of disabled teen. Yup. I haven't been to family events in years for this very reason. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "She didn\u2019t want her own children there. I find it hard to believe there was a 12 year old who was a vital guest as this wedding.", "The bride\u2019s options were A) set an age limit excluding OP\u2019s kid, or B) talk to OP about not bringing their kid. There is no secret third option C where she gets to be mad that people took her at her word and don\u2019t read minds. Sometimes things in life are uncomfortable, but that doesn\u2019t mean she gets to shame OP just because she didn\u2019t want to have an uncomfortable conversation.", "It\u2019s not just about her though, she might be trying to balance her own interests with those who might want to attend. My brothers wedding was 18+, but he made an exception for a 17 yr old cousin because she was the only first cousin still below 18 did not want to hurt her feelings by singling her out.", ">A) set an age limit excluding OP\u2019s kid\n\nCompletely ignores if she wanted someone there that was 13....\n\n>B) talk to OP about not bringing their kid.\n\nOP is well aware that their child has a mental state of a young child, the very group specifically omitted from the invite. It's pretty obvious to anyone with a lick of sense what is trying to be achieved by someone who says \"no one under 10 at this gathering.\" You don't have to read her mind to have a little bit of awareness."]}
