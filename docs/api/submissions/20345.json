You knew that, that\u2019s why you brought something else for him to do.  If you have to give someone something else to do at an event, they should not be at that event.", "ESH\nShe should have said no kids 13 and under. But clearly, the point of the rule was to eliminate kids who would need care and oversight, and your son needs those things.", "I lean to YTA. No kids under 10 implies exactly what your sister said. She only wanted kids that can take care of themselves. She probably assumed you where on the same page.", "You know that your son is developmentally not 10 years old, despite his actual age.

The point of the no kids things is that they don't want disruptions or children that have to be catered to. The fact that she didn't even bring her own children is proof of that.

If someone brought a 35 year old man with the mental capacity of a 2 year old who has tantrums, I'm sure that the no child rule would also apply. \n\nIn the future, she will just make sure to exclude you and your family.

You knew the rule was no children under 13 and as a parent you were well aware of why she made that rule. Yes, your child is 13 but even you admits that his mentally he\u2019s much younger.

YOU were NOT THE GUEST OF HONOR!  You should have had someone look after your special needs child.  That was very selfish and entitled of you to do that.

You know your child lacks a maturity level to match his age yet you brought him anyway. \n\nYou should have gotten a sitter and left him at home. If that was impossible you should have worked with your sister on a plan to keep him in another location in the building during the ceremony to avoid the possibility of him causing a disruption. \n\nYou are used to how he acts and it doesn't phase you, but I'm sure his outburst, no matter how brief, was magnified in the quietness of the ceremony. You were very inconsiderate.", "This depends on the invitation and RSVP. Was your child included on the invitation? Did you include him in the RSVP? If his name was on the invitation then your NTA.

You brought entertainment for this very reason. In most circumstances, this would be viewed as good, proactive parenting and you would be commended. However, based on my own tendencies, in this situation, my suspicion is you purposefully disregarded the spirit of your sisters request. Was it malicious or just inconsiderate? Who knows other than you and your sister? Was this revenge from a slight from years ago? Who knows other than you and your sister. \n\nShould she have been more explicit? Sure, but that would force her to be TAH leading up to her wedding day. Was it really necessary?

He quickly started being restless and then wasn't paying attention at all since he was on his iPad and listening to music... He wasn't interested in the wedding, he probably just didn't want to feel left out. Yta, your sister probably didn't want to single your kid out and expected you would take the hint with the no kids under 10 (aka no kids that will not be able to sit still or would cause disruptions). I would apologize to her instead of arguing. If she pulled you aside afterwards, that means the whole room probably noticed the distraction your son was causing... you're downplaying the episode in your post.

You have a responsibility as a parent to know your child\u2019s limits and know whether something is appropriate to bring him to.  This wedding was not the right event.

Even older toddlers get excited about things and have opinions.

That means he was disruptive. I don\u2019t know why you think it would have been ableist if she had said OP\u2019s son couldn\u2019t come.

So how is it ableist to say a special needs child can\u2019t come for the same reason?", "They brought an iPad to be ready for when he was disruptive.

I would be so angry with my mom. It's such an important day and she don't want her children be part of it? The ceremony I understand (I would handle it different but it's fine if she wants it like this) but this don't make sense for me. Again I know this has nothing to do with the question but for me that's the worst part of it.\n\nI don't think you're the asshole, your sone wanted to be at the weeding of his aunt, want to support her, even if he can't show it the way other kids his age could.\nIf she wanted the ceremony without him because of interruptions, she could have sayed that and ask if it's ok if he comes after that.", "Yes as a 3 and 6 year old, I too would be angry with my mom /s. I get to stay home and play instead of dressing up. You have no idea what those kids want. Stop projecting. As a 6 year old, I wanted to watch cartoons and eat, not dress up in stuffy clothes and watch adults talk about stuff. \n\nIn the end his kid played on his iPad anyways lol. So what was the point of bringing him? I'm on the spectrum, being brought to new places was actually terrible. There's the lights, the people, the smells, the loud sounds. I guarantee you he would've been happier in a quiet FAMILIAR place playing on his iPad. \n\nNot only that, but maybe it's about the bride and groom and not the kids on a wedding day?", "You are right I never considered that the kids maybe wanted to stay elsewhere. If that's so forcing them wouldn't be right. I personally didn't though that would be a possibility.\nMaybe I'm the one being 'not normal' about that, being excluded of such an event is the worst punishment I could imagine in a family, but I see there much people seeing it a different way."]}
