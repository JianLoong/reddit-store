He kicked off about how much he hates doing them because it hurts his nose, refusing and arguing with me. I told him if he has it and my grandparents got it because of him I'd never forgive him. I always take a test before I go to my grandparents.\n\nThis week, I had spent 10hrs setting up the venue and once done I wanted to go to the store for snacks. When we got there he just bullied me out the shop because I was taking too long \"looking at peanuts\". I asked him why is he rushing me and he said because he wants to get back. He arrived several hours after me and we already finished all the setup, so I replied saying we were only in the store 5 minutes but we left without getting everything because he made me feel uncomfortable, by huffing and walking away/infront of me (he does this alot as he says i'm slow at walking, I have back problems). I said on the drive back that I've been there all day setting up the wedding venue without him being there while my only family are at home dying and he couldnt let me spend 5 minutes to get some fucking peanuts or say thanks.\n\nThe final straw was after the ceremony the pictures were being taken and it came to the \"family of the groom photos\" my partner, his parents and I were all instructed to have pictures taken and my partner said \"no, sorry not you\". His parents didn't hear this interaction but noticed I hadn't moved and asked why I wasn't coming along and I said he told me I'm not included in this bit, they were annoyed by this and said I am family so I've to come.\n\nWhat he said broke my heart, we've been together for 4 years.\n\nI continued the evening as if nothing happened and the remainder of the wedding and reception was amazing for the family.\n\nNext day at home I told him I want a break from the relationship, he was being verbally abusive to me and saying how unfair as he thought it was only \"actual family\". I told him that only he had a problem with me being there and it was his family who were offended on my behalf and that even if they did want to exclude me he could have atleast defended me for the sake of one photo or asked the bride/groom if I was to be included, he just assumed I wasn't wanted or was considered actual family, this hurt especially given my circumstance.\n\nSo AITA for being upset about his recent behaviour?", "created_utc": 1667172894, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhtzfj/aita_for_my_reaction_to_being_excluded_by_my/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He literally walks away from you because you walk slower from back problems. His family seems great but he seems like an ass (from the limited info we got on him). Hopefully, his good characteristics outweigh the bad but in this case he's the ass. I can understand he may have misunderstood or took it too literally about family only but something about the snippets you gave about his past behavior (even his attitude in the store that very day) leads me to believe he understood.", "NTA. He was willing to potentially give your grandparents a life threatening illness because his nose \u201churt\u201d.

The second he said \"no, not you\" and didn't want you in the family pictures says it all I feel. He doesn't see you as a part of his future. It's also clear he hasn't talked to his family about it, either. My heart goes out to you for your situation. It's not fun and it's rough. A relationship should be helping you feel supported and loved, not like what you've described.", "NTA. He's already disconnected from the relationship. The only reason why he wouldn't want you in family photos is because he doesn't see your 4 year as permanent and he doesn't see you as family.\n\nYou rightfully need his support right now and it sounds like he can't be bothered. I'm sorry for your situation, I'm sorry about your grandparents, and I hope things get better soon.", "How old are you because at 4 years you are either going to be married or just know this is your person.

If he can't change his ways, it might be time to let go.", "NTA- make this a permanent break. He sounds like a huge jerk!", "NAH.  It was a miscommunication and this is obviously a tender spot for you.  Your bf was being too literal about who was supposed to be in the picture.  \n\nHow he reacted when you said you wanted to take a break is more concerning than the photo business.  You've been together 4 years.  Is he frequently verbally abusive?  What you say here sounds like a conversation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The lack of getting married is more on my end due to the family issue, but he isn't particularly fussed by it either. \n\nI've only recently been conflicted by how he feels based on what was in my post.", "I was also wondering this too with taking the comment \"only family\" literally, he does have a history of this. \n\nWe typically have a very stable relationship, we do not argue very much and neither I nor him are verbally or physically abusive.

OP has a right to feel they\u2019re on a permanent track. It\u2019s not her fault he\u2019s a child who can\u2019t verbalize his feelings and instead lashes out at her. You\u2019re saying the bf would drop her if she asked for a break\u2026so what? OP is saying that the relationship isn\u2019t working now, she\u2019d be fine with a permanent break if he doesn\u2019t want to change/treat her like a partner. In fact, are YOU the bf? No OP, do not suck up this behavior out of fear you won\u2019t have it in your life forever (eyeroll).", "Aha. Got it. Thanks for clarifying.", "I don't think you were wrong to get offended. The interactions you described makes it seem like he doesn't like you.  I don't think anyone who loves you would behave like this unless something else is going on?  I think you need to take some time and really ask yourself if he is the one you want beside you through the next difficult period in your life. Will he support you or be a drain? Only you know the answers to those questions.", "Maybe you can chat with him about it. If you haven't gone through it, your situation is tough to understand.  Some people are saying he is awful.  Is he awful deliberately (with bad intentions)?  Or is he clueless?  Is this relationship worth the effort to work on?  Only you know these things.  Do what is right for you.", "Aw cute. I\u2019m not a dude though lol. \n\nIt\u2019s also true that OP isn\u2019t related to them\u2026.", "Sounds like he does too.", "This reminds me of a post I saw once where a woman complained that her husband (a stay at home dad) didn't do anything and she worked full time and still took care of the kid when home. And some joker in the comments was like \"if you leave him say bye to all those expensive gifts women love\" like. Why do so many people act like you're going to be missing a huge jerk like that??? Friend, I hope OP takes the break, makes it permanent and finds someone who would marry her in her grandparents living room just to make it happen for her. We don't miss men like that and we don't care if the bridge is burned.", "Lol, just letting her know. I think she should really. Better for her and him. Doesn't really affect me either way.", "Yeah and???? Not being blood related doesn't mean people can't call you family", "Lol, I don't necessarily wish for that. That'd be rushing it, and then she'd be stuck with a stranger lol.\n\nDoesn't affect me either way whether she stays with current bf or leaves, just letting her know that a \"break\" probably won't be temporary, since she was acting like it would be.\n\nThey'd both be better off with other people from the sounds of it."]}
