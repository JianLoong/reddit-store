We don't have live TV and my wife has a news program that she watches everyday but it's a day after the original airing. She watches it on Hulu in the early evening. I'm usually in the room during the show but not really interested as I already read the news online earlier in the day.\n\nYesterday we were watching her news program together but as I mentioned it's a day late. Normally this doesn't really matter as there's nothing that urgent on that program. During the show they started reporting on the missing submarine. I thought I would just let her know that they confirmed the sub had in fact imploded. I normally don't interject but I thought she might want to know.\n\nHer response was \"Thanks a lot for ruining it for me!\" She says I'm an asshole for ruining the story. I started to cry/laugh.\n\nSo tell me, am I the asshole for \"ruining the story\" for her?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: No one is laughing at the tragedy. After her comment and my laughing (at the comment) she also started laughing at herself for even saying what she said. She works a lot and doesn't spend any time online. This is the only news she consume other than our conversations about current events/news that I've read or watched. She's not actually mad at me and doesn't really believe I'm  an asshole. \n\nWe were both laughing because we both new how wrong her comment was. She did call me an asshole and I'm always reading this sub so I thought I would post this for a laugh.", "created_utc": 1687551091, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14h8fgu/aita_for_telling_my_wife_the_lost_submarine_had/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

These were the days before you really used your phone for news, and my Dad was out. So everytime something significant happened (new planes crashing, towers collapsing, etc.), I'd ring him to tell him. \n\nIt was the bizarrest day. We all know in hindsight what happened, but as it was actually happening - it was even more dramatic, and adrenaline-driven (even if you weren't personally involved). In addition to the planes, collapsing towers, the USA apparently powerless to defend itself militarily against massive attack, etc. - there were also (incorrect) rumours of bomb explosions in various places, hostage situations, attacks in other countries, etc. \n\nAnd all sorts of evacuations took place around the world, including many buildings in London. People were even fleeing to the countryside in cars. Basically, we all knew immediately there was going to be war. The only question was how widespread such a war would be.\n\nSo I'd ring my Dad regularly, to update him. Since this was the biggest news story of our lives, and would probably have serious repercussions for many countries. Well, my Dad finally lost his patience with the updates.
