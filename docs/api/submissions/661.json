{"id": 661, "submission_id": "yfskz3", "title": "AITA for reporting my sons 'good' teacher for taking his confiscated phone home with her where it got damaged?", "selftext": "Last week Friday my son (10) got his phone confiscated at school. He was mucking around with it during class and the school rules are clear about phone usage during class without permission so I totally understood. The normal protocol is that the phone would go to the office where it would be returned to the student at the end of the day or the next day.\n\nHis teacher however apparently forgot to stop by the office before going home after school so she accidentally took it home with her and hrough some negligence, the phone broke in the hands of her toddler. Admittedly she was very upfront about it and even came to our house personally to tell us what happened and apologise which I respect. She suggested the repayment plan for the phone and offered an old phone of hers for him in the meantime but it was essentially a brick with a screen. After she left I sent an email to the school about everything simply because I think it something the school should also be involved in since she's a teacher and easily took home a confiscated device albeit by mistake. Received a response Monday morning apologising for what happened and promising to address the issue.\n\nSo my SIL works at the high school but smokes with the teachers at the junior school which is where she bumped into this teacher who was pissed and said that we were being assholes reporting it since she already promised to pay for the phone, offered an alternative and is a good teacher so we're messing with her career unnecessarily. So yeah, am I the assholes?", "created_utc": 1666973504, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yfskz3/aita_for_reporting_my_sons_good_teacher_for/", "score": 9173, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There\u2019s zero reasons why it should have been within her toddler\u2019s reach.", "NTA - The teacher did not follow guidelines. Albeit your son was in the wrong. However phones prices scale and she had no reason to take it home with her. How her toddler then got a hold of it and broke it is a complete different issue. Teacher is upset she got in trouble for not following the rules, just like your son was upset his phone was taken for not following the rules.", "Hmmm\u2026the toddler broke it? So did she give the phone to the child or did the child go into her bag? \n\nRegardless, NTA. Your son was wrong to muck around with his phone when he knew not to and had it taken away. But her negligence in taking the phone home and breaking it is much worse. \n\nWhy did she have it on her person? 10 yo kids are in elementary school and teachers don\u2019t really switch classrooms during the day. She failed to stow the phone in her desk or elsewhere. She is fully culpable for this.", "NTA - She should have reported it to the school first. By going directly to you she was hoping to keep it unofficial. She made an honest mistake and if she had reported it the school probably would have paid for the phone and figured out a policy for dropping off confiscated phones after hours. Now she is in much hotter water. Her fault. You were in the right keeping things official.", "NTA, mistakes happen. But responsible adults own up to them. Plus, this was not a single mistake. This was multiple acts of irresponsibility.", "NTA- Why her toddler got a hold of your sons phone is indefensible. If she had accidentally brought it home, she should have dropped it off at your home before the chance of that happening even came into play. \n\nShe should have dropped it back off at the office and various other things that should have happened. \n\nYou calling the school doesn\u2019t make you an AH because she did this while under the employ of the school, and they are responsible for their employees actions. The school should be buying a new phone and they can work out repayment between the teacher and themselves. \n\nI was close to a NAH but the fact that she took it home and her toddler damaged it is what pushed me to the NTA.", "NTA. Reaching out to the school left a paper trail of the incident in case she doesn\u2019t follow through with the payment plan and in case there\u2019s no documentation of said plan.", "NTA, and I would guess that at least part of what she\u2019s got into trouble for is approaching you to make a financial agreement privately without making the school aware.  If an incident occurs where a teacher is in a position of obligation/debt to a student her management need to know about it so there\u2019s no opportunity for accusations or misunderstandings. You making the school aware is protecting both your kid and the teacher involved. It was really unwise of her to put herself into this position - mistakes happen but if I were her manager I\u2019d be having a conversation about the importance of making sure the school know about them.", "NTA\n\nHer story just doesn't make sense\n\nFor the life of me I can't see why she would confiscate a phone and then put it in her purse or her bag.\n\nI would have done the same thing...but I would have explained the teacher is making restitution and you do not want her to get in trouble, but at the same time, parents deserve a more rigid phone policy.  If a teacher confiscates a phone, there should be a dedicated secure place in her classroom where the phone is kept.  That way if they forget to take it to the office, it stays secure in a locked drawer...not in a teachers purse", "NTA. You only have the teacher\u2019s word that she is going to pay you. If she doesn\u2019t and then you tell the school, you wouldn\u2019t have any evidence of the teacher breaking the phone. I don\u2019t fault you for notifying her employer (responsible for her actions) and leaving written proof of the agreement.", "NTA she just didn\u2019t want her fuck-up made aware to her boss, she essentially stole your sons phone and then broke it.", "NTA even accidents have consequences. You would think a teacher would know that.", "They sometimes keep the confiscated phones overnight at the school?! When I was in school I NEEDED my phone to communicate with parents about after school pickup and transportation to sports practice, etc. That\u2019s actually wild.", "NTA with money involved, paper trails are important. It sucks that teachers are broke though.", "INFO:\nWhat exactly did you tell the school?\nDid you mention she apologised and is paying the phone back.\nOr did you just mention she broke the phone by taking it home?", "NTA teacher never should\u2019ve had it on her person. When you confiscate a phone you put it somewhere safe, like a teachers desk. This was complete negligence on her part", "Soft NTA.\n\nThere are always situations where one party faults on a verbal agreement, then the harmed party can\u2019t do anything because they never signed a contract or told anyone.\nMost newer phones are upwards of $1k, which I\u2019ll assume is true for your son\u2019s phone since the teacher requires a payment plan. \nI will say that it would have been better for the teacher to inform the school of her negligence, so that they could have helped address this issue (Some schools would legally be responsible for this, which is likely why they\u2019re upset with her). \n\nI do think it\u2019s necessary for kids to have phones nowadays if they are in America. I don\u2019t know why people are being weird about this in the comments as if there haven\u2019t been 40 school shootings this year, one of the larger ones happening only 4 months ago. \nEven if you\u2019re not in America, bad things and emergencies happen. It\u2019s okay for 10 year olds to have phones. \n\nI will say you should have informed the teacher that you planned on emailing the school regarding the situation so they weren\u2019t caught off-guard and you could determine the best course of action. Going behind the teacher\u2019s back after you\u2019ve seemingly come to an agreement is as asshole move. I only excuse it because of my first point.\n\nIn general, you definitely should talk to your child about being attentive in class to avoid this situation all together.", "NTA its best to keep it through the school instead of becoming a legal \"he said she said\". The court would probably ask if you contacted the school about this if she does refuse to pay.", "NTA clearly she needs retraining in protocol, because there was no reason for the phone to end up in her personal possessions. If she couldn't take it to the office right that moment, it should have gone in her desk. At no point should it have gone in her purse/school bag/whatever. \n\nAlso in no way do I believe her toddler somehow got it and broke it.", "Nta,   The teacher broke protocol. She should have reported to school. You need the school in case a problem arose.   It is great she fessed up and wants to pay but.  I will also say, how did her toddler get the phone . My son when he was a toddler never ended up with mine..   but thats not the point.  Teachers should be held to rules like kids.", "Why does a 10 yr old have a phone at school anyhow? The teacher came to the home to apologize and offer to pay for the phone. I see no reason to call the school. Accidents happen. You obviously planned on calling the school so why not tell the teacher that although you appreciate her honesty you still felt you needed to report the incident. The teacher was up front and honest. You were not.", "And people wonder why there is such a big teacher shortage in the US!!!  I'm sure over the next 20 years, children will be taught by computers since more and more teachers will slowly but surely exit the industry.  So often you hear about these school shootings, and you also hear about the teachers who throw themsves between the gunnan and the children.  It's a completely different world now than how I remember it.\nYou should have never made an agreement with her if you knew that you were going to email the school.  You should have said, I appreciate the apology but I am going to be contacting the school on Monday to let them know so they are aware.  Instead, you made her feel like all is ok in the world.  Backhanded.  That's all that was.  \nGood luck to your son who has to be with her the rest of the year.  His days of fiddling with phones and not focusing are DEFINITELY over.  Lol!!!", "YTA - You looked that teacher right in their face, accepted their apology, then turned around and shot of an email to their boss. That\u2019s horrible role modeling. If you had a problem with that teacher you should have said so instead of going behind their back. All you did was kick someone when they were down. \n\nIt was petty at that point and only served to let other teachers know not to trust or confide in you. When you accepted her apology then sent that email you violated a trust.", "YTA not every issue needs to be addressed by \"the manager\".  If there is nothing sketchy and you both agree on a compensation - keep it under the radar.", "You all are so terribly cynical and reporting it to the school is such an AH move. What is wrong with everyone? 10 yr old with a phone in class? YTA", "NTA she basically stole and destroyed the phone and now she\u2019s trying to cover her own ass", "I don't get the Y. T. A\n\nSchool needed to know she wasn't following protocol.\n\nThey also need to know she didn't go through proper channels of communication.\n\nShe could have done all that(apologize/payment) at school on schools time \n\nWhere it should have been handled and meditated by a third party.\n\nThe fact that she went straight to youeans she knew she messed up and the school would not like that because you know rules are rules after all!\n\nNTA op good on you for going to the school. You did everything right, her not following the rules of the school wether through negligence or otherwise should not have happened.\n\nI'm also curious as to how her kid got a hold of it.", "NTA. It's good that she took responsibility,  but looping the school in asked them to set protocol and rules for teachers.  It also provides documentation that she agreed to pay and that it's her fault.", "So many people in this thread clearly don't understand how toddlers work. They get into everything. That's the least questionable or strange part of this entire situation.", "I'm going with NTA. \nReason 1. It should never have been mixed with her personal belongings to begin with.\nReason 2. If she could drop it by after it was broken then she certainly could have before it was.\nReason 3. Even after owning up to it with you, she needed to inform the school. This could cause them potential legal issues as she was acting under their employment. She just wanted the easy way out with no ramifications at work.\nWhen I was in school we had these same rules, and I'll tell you now, your child can say no. I would tell my teacher \"I'll take it to the office myself to be sure it gets there.\" I had my phone stolen from a teachers desk in 6th grade so after that I was pretty uptight about it. They would get mad but they'd call the office and let them know I was coming with my phone. Then I would pick it up at the end of the day.", "NTA and what is this crap about repayment plans. Cash right now is what they owe you.", "NTA she acted in the name of the school so they should be aware of it", "NTA.  The only way I would not have reported this is if she would have immediately given me the money to replace the phone.  \n\nFunny how she expects your son to follow the rules or suffer the consequences but doesn't want the same to apply to her own actions.", "Nta. There's something weird about it. And there's potential for it to be a safeguarding issue, if teachers are taking electrons hone and giving them back to children. Particularly if the parents don't check the device afterwards. School needs to be aware of the 'mishap'.", "NTA.\n\nSince the phone was confiscated at the school, it's a school policy, and she's a teacher there, it is a school issue. It sounds, and understandably so, that she wanted to avoid the standard repercussions that would come with her actions. You were going through the proper channels, especially as she tried to give you a different phone as a replacement. If you were doing it maliciously though, the you'd kinda be a bit of an AH, but it was still the right thing to do, regardless of the motivations.", "NTA. She shouldn\u2019t have taken it home in the first place. \n\nAnd even if we excuse that with forgetting it. Then No one and especially not a toddler should have had the opportunity to so much as look at it from a distance, let alone fondle it and ruin it.", "NTA\n\nWhy would she even let it near her toddler???", "ESH. I\u2019m a teacher with a toddler. It\u2019s a stressful life. Mistakes happen. There\u2019s tons of plausible scenarios why she just put the phone into her bag, meaning to drop it off, and forgot about it, not realising she still had the phone with her until she got home. She should\u2019ve put it out of reach of her toddler. It should\u2019ve been kept safe. That\u2019s where she was wrong.\n\nBut reporting her when she obviously tried to make amends was a shit move. \n\nAnd people accusing her of actually STEALING the phone baffle me. Do your ten year-olds have $1000 phones? All pre-teen kids I know (many) have cheap or old phones, their parents\u2019 hand-me-downs, etc. Kids that age break and lose their phones all the time and only use them for games. Not very likely that a teacher would risk their job over stealing a kid\u2019s phone.", "NTA, that's a completely egregious mistake and you were well within your rights to report it. You have no idea whether they will pay for the phone or not.", "It\u2019s funny she was able to go to your home to cover up her wrong doing but didn\u2019t drop off your sons phone when she realized she still had it. NTA", "NTA.  You weren't \"reporting it\", like you were trying to get her in trouble, you were just making sure it was on the record, which is always the right thing to do when it comes to property damage.  Twice, I've had someone hit my car with theirs, and then they get out and approach me, \"Oh, please don't call the police!  I can't have this on my insurance!\"  Well, they should have thought of that before they hit me.  Always report damage like this, because you have no idea if she'll follow through on her promises of repayment, or if she'll renege.  Now that it's on the record, she can't back out.  How unprofessional of her to walk around calling you assholes for simply doing what any thinking person should do.", "NTA. He broke the rules and had to face the consequences. She broke the rules and now she does too.", "NTA because what if she decided to not pay.", "NTA - she messed up. She apologized, and offered to fix it (both good for her), but that doesn't automatically mean that she shouldn't be held accountable (and who's to say, a month from now, she decides she shouldn't have to pay, and its your word against hers - and a school wondering why you didn't tell them sooner).", "I am a teacher. I have accidentally walked out of school with things I didn\u2019t need to bring home but never a phone. What I do with that stuff though is leave it in my car so I can bring it back the next day. No real excuse for her to give it to her toddler. NTA", "Seems like your son learned a lesson about messing with his phone during class time. He knew the rules and the teacher had to stop class time and take the phone away. Then accidentally forgot about it and it broke.  Now she has to pay for the phone on her earnings. He has some responsibility here as well. She made a mistake. He was using it purposefully.", "YTA. The teacher agreed to pay for the damage and even offered you a phone to use while she paid off that one. There was nothing the school could have done to provide further closure for you unless you were looking for some kind of punitive measures to be taken against the teacher. The is just my opinion but while what she did was irresponsible, your son is the ultimate cause of what happened. He had no business breaking the school rules and showed he's probably not mature enough for you to give him a phone to take to school", "YTA! Why does your son or any kid for that fact have a phone. She had to be responsible for the phone that your son had when he shouldn't.  She had to be responsible for the phone and not leave it in the class room cause it might get stolen.  Why is your unaccountablilty for you and your childs belongings be her responsibility? And  don't play it off as \"he was just mucking around with it\"  No he wasn't he was on it when he shouldn't be. She shouldn't have to do shit or pay you shit.", "Yeeeeah, YTA. \n\nTo err is human, and she made every effort to make right. Your bringing admin into things was unnecessary. Guaranteed she would never have made that mistake again anyways, so you just kicked someone when they\u2019re down. \n\nVery TA.", "YTA. Why does your ten year old son have a smart phone", "Yes.  You are the AH who allowed your son to take a phone to school and then violate school rules.  Got that?  Your son brought the phone to school and 'mucked around' with it in class.  You're brushing off your child's breaking the rules.  You're brushing off that you permitted that to happen.  And then you feel 'entitled' to report this to the school district?   If I were a board member in the district I would reprimand the teacher for not turning in the phone as per policy AND suspend your child for 3 days for taking out the phone in the first place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. Don't start arguing that a 10 year old needs a phone in elementary or middle school. They don't.", "Bruh, why does a 10 year old have a phone in the first place?", "Sorry, OP: you're the AH here. What did you think the school admin could rectify that hadn't already been settled? Bringing the phone home, the damage, taking responsibility, providing a temporary stopgap phone, or making arrangements to cover the cost of replacement? It sounds like she covered all the bases already. Seriously, what was your motive?", "YTA. She tried to do the right thing, there's no need to ruin her life.", "Definitely YTA. First, your 10yo not only HAS a phone, but you let them BRING IT TO SCHOOL. What does a 10yo need a phone at school for? \n\nYes, the teacher messed up but then handled it 100% professionally. It was an accident because YOU let a 10yo being a phone to SCHOOL. Y.T.A.", "I'd almost always say n t a, but this one I think is maybe a YTA. After it happened, she did everything she could possibly done, and you punished her anyway. People are human, and mistakes happen. She could have left her bag on a chair because her toddler was doing something insane when she got home, and by the time she fixed everything,  she forgot about it and maybe started making dinner. Toddler goes in the bag and whoop, there it is. Yes, she made a mistake, but it was totally in the realm of normal shit happens. \n\nShe obviously makes so little money she needs a repayment plan for a child's phone.", "YTA. Or rather, why did you report her? What are you hoping to achieve apart from what you're already getting directly from the teacher? I'm not trying to be obnoxious, but really want to know what added good can come from reporting? From the outside it looks like petty revenge and that might actually backfire on your son.", "YTA, either decline her offers of payment and report higher up, or stick to the agreement made.", "YTA, teachers make nothing. Life is hard, why are you making it harder?", "It was a mistake and it sounds like the teacher is a good person who did her best to rectify it. Why did you feel it was so necessary to try to damage her personally with a complaint? \n\nMust be nice to go through life having never made a mistake. \n\nI guarantee you whomever received your complaint shared it with the entire facility and they all called you an asshole in the faculty lounge.\n\nYTA", "ESH.  But you contributing to the lose of good teachers in the system as well.  Why does a 10 yo need a phone at school? (he doesn't).", "Yta. She tried to make it right. This is your sons fault.", "YTA. This whole thing happened because you got a 10 year old a phone and they broke the rules and played with it at school. Which, of course, they\u2019re 10 and a fancy phone is way better than paying attention in school. Take SOME responsibility in that at least.", "I don't think you are an AH but I wouldn't have reported her if it was an honest mistake and she went out of the way the way like she did to immediately correct it.", "NTA - how did her toddler manage to grab the phone and break it??", "NAH. Stuff happens. We have all forgotten about something we were supposed to do at the end of the day. We have all had our kids get into things they shouldn\u2019t get into. The teacher immediately owned up to it, said she would pay for the phone, and offered a short term replacement. Getting the school involved doesn\u2019t change anything, except for put her career at risk for something that she has already admitted she was at fault for and is trying to make better. What do you possibly gain from reporting her? I understand you\u2019re frustrated, but given everything teachers go through every day, her brain not operating at 100% at the end of the day is completely understandable. Especially if she has 10-year-olds pulling out cell phones in class. What 10-year-old needs a cell phone?", "NAH I think it was poor judgment on the teachers part to not involve the school to begin with. Something like this needs to be discussed with school officials and the parents to make sure that their aren\u2019t any miscommunication. \n\nWe were all children once, Doing things we are not supposed to do, unfortunately behaviors like this is common, But as a parent, you need to speak with your child to make sure it\u2019s not a repeated occurrence. And properly discipline your child, to avoid future mishaps. \n\nIMO Involving the school was probably right decision, which the teacher should\u2019ve done to begin with. She was willing to admit fault, and to rectify the situation, which I admire, but at the end of the day the school need to facilitate this to protect all parties involved. I will give the benefit of the doubt that it doesn\u2019t seem you wanted to affect the teachers career. But others may not see it that way. Not sure how strict the school is and what kind of consequences the teacher might face. So it\u2019s probably best if everyone sit down and have a talk, so you\u2019re all on the same page.", "I saw someone say that the teacher should have reported it directly to the school herself, and I wholeheartedly agree. Although the school might still hold her liable for replacing the phone, the administration should be aware of the situation because it could change the dynamic in the classroom and/or snowball in a myriad of different ways. \n\nIt\u2019s great that she immediately informed you, accepted fault, and stated she would replace it, although a payment plan isn\u2019t ideal, at least for you. \n\nYou\u2019re not TA for reporting what she should have reported herself. And she needs to pinch whatever pennies necessary to get that phone replaced ASAP.", "NTA if her actions were above board, there wouldn\u2019t be anything for the school administration to criticise. If you confiscate a pupil\u2019s belongings, you don\u2019t take them home. You leave them locked in a drawer or take them to the office. It\u2019s just weird to take it home and then allow your toddler to break it (and most phones are pretty tough these days!).", "NTA.\n\nIt's great that she did what was right and immediately told you, apologized, and offered to pay for it.\n\nHowever, this is still something that the school should be aware happened.", "If she agreed to pay it back and was remorseful then YTA. I see people here saying she should pay it up front\u2026but she\u2019s a teacher so we all know they are underpaid. And if she did offer a brick that is better than nothing (in which case yea bring it up to the school) but why does your 10yo need something more than a brick? This is one of those situations where your complaint prob makes it a lot harder for teachers which is silly considering it was an honest mistake. Who knows how her toddler got it. I doubt she gave it to her kid to play with just like that so seems like an accident that she was willing to fix.", "NTA", "NTA\n\ntake a kids phone for using it in class, fine. Not returning it by the time they are leaving that same day? Not fine", "Everything was settled an handled at that point. \"informing\" the school amounts to tattling. You're NTA, you're just pathetic", "NTA, if she could come to your house to apologize, she could easily have come to your house to return the phone as soon as she realized her mistake.", "I am going against the grain here and saying YTA.  She came to you and told you what happened and is paying for the replacement.  How the toddler got it is beside the point.  She made an honest mistake and admitted fault.  What more did you want?  Seems to me you decided that her apology and paying for a new one wasn't good enough for you.  I don't think she was doing anything untoward with the phone.  She simply forgot she had it.  Have you never done that?  Even though your son is at fault for all of this because he was the one who took it out when he knew he wasn't supposed to, you decided she needed to be punished.  Not fair in my opinion.  I think the old brick phone was a good consequence for your son, though mine would have been no new phone until I have the time to get a replacement.  He needs some kind of consequence for his part in this after all.  His phone would be sitting in his backpack at school right now if he had followed the rules.", "NTA\n\nToddler broke it? Likely story. She\u2019s blaming someone who can\u2019t defend themselves for something she likely did herself.", "YTA. She made a mistake. She\u2019s juggling a hundred kids all doing dumb s&it. She acknowledged her error, apologized, and offered to financially rectify the situation. The Toddler probably got into her belongings as they always do, and that\u2019s when she realized she hadnt dropped it at the office and decided to admit and fix the situation immediately. She even offered a phone in the meantime in replacement. I wish most adults in the world owned up to their mistakes and behaved as honestly as this example. I wouldn\u2019t have had to rewind my cameras to see who crunched the bumper on my car a few weeks ago. If I were you, I would have marched my child right up and pointed. \u201cSee! This is exactly what you do when you make a mistake that may affect someone else negatively take responsibility!\u201d Cause 8 times out of 10 many people wouldn\u2019t. They would blame the child, gaslight , use their authority, etc. I don\u2019t think negatively affecting her career was the appropriate punishment. Think of how many mistakes you yourself have made juggling the kids and running errands\u2026and if you say none you are part of the problem no offense. Lol. Next time she\u2019ll prolly think twice.", "NTA Am I the onlyone who thought about why the Phone was with her toddler?", "NTA\n\nYou'd think a \"good\" teacher would have the foresight not to leave something she knows is expensive enough to need a payment plan to replace where a toddler could get their hands on it.", "NAH. The teacher did the right thing by offering to pay for it, but that doesn't mean you're an asshole for reporting it to the school. It wasn't necessary to do so, but it also wasn't a dick move. Depending on your wording I guess? \n\nShe is understandably upset about getting reported, but you were within your rights to report a somewhat serious issue to the school.", "I don\u2019t really care what everyone says I think you ATA. Teachers are already overworked, underpaid and under a lot of stress. It was an honest mistake and you went out of your way to make sure she gets reprimanded. You all must have a surplus of teachers where you are but we don\u2019t in Michigan. I just think it\u2019s petty that you did that.", "I'm not sure I'd be so quick to call you the asshole here.   \n\n\nI'm a little confused why everyone thinks dude is an asshole?   A two month repayment plan in this situation is just not ok.     Taking the phone home was an accident and a goof, and I would have told my kid, 'well, if you'd followed school rules this never would have happened to begin with' but she should have shown up check/cash in hand, not with a plan promise.     \n\n\nThe only thing I might have done differently is i would have brought it up immediately rather than going directly to the school. \"Thank you for your honesty.   However, the phone needs to be replaced immediately.   Can we find a way to make that happen?\"  And then made a decision based on her response.", "Why report the teacher if she already made arrangements to replace the phone that, had your son not been playing with it, wouldn't have been confiscated in the first place? She offered to make good on it, so you should have left it at that. \nWhen you get his new phone, please make sure you get insurance for it. Accidents happen.", "Yep: YTA.\n\nYour kid broke the rules. The teacher accidentally got the device broke, came to you to make it right, and offered to pay for a new phone as she could. On a teacher's salary!\n\nYou then went over her head after she'd already done the right thing, trying to get her in trouble.\n\nYou ought to be ashamed.", "Minority opinion, YTA. She owned up and took responsibility. Why narc?", "NTA. You should have this incident on file, even if it was a total accident and the teacher is super apologetic about it. Down the line she could stop making the payments towards a new phone and you wouldn\u2019t have anything to prove it. Maybe she has bad intentions and your son isn\u2019t the only kid whose phone went home with her. I think in this instance it makes total sense to make the school aware.", "NTA, you had to protect your interests. There was nothing enforcing this payment plan but her word, but now the incident is documented. The school might even pay you back faster to avoid any legal issues. It was an honest mistake, but honest mistakes have consequences.", "NTA.  The policy should be that the phone is given back at the end of the day.  I would assume most parents get a phone for their children to be able to communicate with them.  What if there was an emergency sometime between getting out of school and getting to the parents and the phone is sitting in a drawer somewhere? I would freak out! \nAlso, how would her toddler have got the phone and destroyed it with no one noticing?\nIt just seems suspicious to me.  Not saying she was trying to steal it, but just a series of poor choices on her part.  Just as kids have to deal with consequences, so do adults. It\u2019s not like you did it to intentionally get her in trouble, but I agree that it should be taken care of with the school involved, if anything so they can take a look and revise their policies. \n\nAnyone else think it\u2019s strange that she went to their house?  She was really trying to keep it off the record.", "As a teacher, I don\u2019t understand how it made it home. Even if I forgot to turn in something I confiscated, it would at least still be in my classroom. Why did it even go home?!!", "NTA. I bet the reason she went to your house to talk about it was specifically to try to avoid having the school find out about it. How could she even \u201caccidentally\u201d bring it home? Like, if she put it in her purse, sure, but why would she put it in her purse cuz that seems like  whered you put something specifically to forget it and bring it home. And then if it was in her purse, how did her toddler get it?  I feel like she chose to bring it home to use it for whatever reason\u2026 and then her toddler got it when she wasn\u2019t looking. \n\nInfo: did you ever get the broken phone back?", "NTA. not sure why she thinks SHE is the one that's supposed to be mad here lmao. she destroyed your sons property so the only one here entitled to being mad are you and your son. yet she acts like she has the right to be mad at you.", "As a teacher, I would absolutely expect this to be reported to my administrator. My administrator has to follow up on incidents with financial repercussions far less significant than this one, and the teacher should have contacted them already. There is no reasonable professional expectation that the administration should not be made aware.", "Absolutely NTA. She made a mistake and like you said, respect to her for owning up to it and offering to pay but, it's a school-related issue so, it needs to be on the books. It almost makes me thing she must be guilty of other things if she got mad about it whereas, if anything, if it was a random mistake, she should only be embarrassed, yah know? I'm cynical though and have no faith in society so I right away think, \"Hmmmm...\" LOL!", "Reporting it to the school is like when you get in a fender bender with your vehicle and you report it to the insurance company. It doesn\u2019t matter how good a driver they are or even if they promise to pay for the damages. It is just better to have reported it.", "NTA\n\nAnd I am also not understanding the sequence of events. \n\nTypically when an item is confiscated for whatever reason, it is put in a teacher's desk until the teacher has a break. Presumably in the same locked compartment or drawer where the teacher keeps her purse or other valuables.\n\nI could understand not remembering to bring it to the office but at some point she had to take the phone out of the drawer and physically walk to the office? Did she forget at that point she had the phone.\n\nSo okay - giving her the benefit of the doubt again, she put the phone in her purse and then went to the bathroom and so forgot that she still had the phone.\n\nBut then how is the purse accessible to the toddler? It is in her purse and most women put their purses on a table - at any rate most women with toddlers zip up their purses or otherwise fasten it because they don't want the contents scattered around.\n\nAlso what kind of case did it have? There are fairly protective cases like Otter and I would \\*hope\\* that a 10 year old had a protective case instead of a decorative one - but that is neither here nor there. I don't understand how the toddler had access to a phone in a purse or backpack and then mentioned to toss it around so that it was demolished.\n\nAlso why the installment plan? Why should OP be out of pocket since the child needs a phone? Why doesn't the teacher charge the phone and then use the \"installment plan\" to pay off the credit card.", "NTA.  Teachers who claim they\u2019re good teachers aren\u2019t necessarily good teachers. \n\nI am a teacher.  We have a very strict device policy.  First time a kid has their phone out, we have to confiscate it until the end of class.  However, I do not touch their phones.  I have them place them on my desk (it\u2019s happened two or three times this year) and that\u2019s it.  I don\u2019t even want to touch them so I can avoid being culpable in case something happens.  Taking a phone home is just beyond the realm of normal behavior.", "NTA it sounds fishy, definitely check the serial number or IMEI to be certain it really is his phone and not just the same model", "NTA- it is against most schools protocol to take or leave any confiscated item anywhere but the office. When I was is middle school my mom was the school nurse. One day I had my phone confiscated and the teacher told me she was going to leave it in her desk overnight because it wasn\u2019t fair that my mom would be able to grab it (which I get but it doesn\u2019t mean I wouldn\u2019t get in trouble, it\u2019s also not different to the students who lived 50 feet from the school. But I digress) anyways when my mom found out she was pissed because obviously it\u2019s my phone that has personal information on it. So she told the principal and the teacher got in trouble (not extreme but just addressed and told it was against the rules). So NTA also it\u2019s dangerous, there is tons of personal stuff on phones that the teacher or anyone else can access.", "NTA. She came to you first because she was trying to hide it from work. You owe her no obligation to keep that information from them. She broke protocol and whatever happens is not on you.", "NTA. She had every right to confiscate  the phone, none to take it home with her.", "NTA \n\nyes she may if took it home by accident but how did her son get it?? Like yeah no I\u2019d be mad", "NTA I would have immediately owned the mistake, let my principal know, run up credit or borrowed money if it didn\u2019t have the cash to replace it and likely tried to throw in an otter box or something.  \n\nBig screw up but not the end of the world.  But trying to be sneaky about it is unprofessional", "Have you tried bringing it to a cel phone repair place? You may be able to get a brand new screen for 200 or 300.  I'm sure the teacher could pay for that if the repair is successful \n\nAlso, NTA. She should never have brought it home, let alone damaged it.  Toddler or otherwise.", "NTA Op she took your child\u2019s phone home. This is not something normal what usually happens is probably the parent being called to pick it up from a front office or something like that. She broke protocol so the consequences are hers to have. Make her or the school pay for your child\u2019s phone as she did something likely as toddlers aren\u2019t usually able to break a phone that badly. Still it is very possible for a phone to fall at just the wrong enough angle to break badly.", "NTA.\n\nFirst of all how in hell does a toddler break a phone that badly? She probably broke it herself. You ought report her to the fucking authorities.", "NTA. The teacher was acting like a child trying to fix the problem so they didn't get in trouble like they know they should.", "NTA  Your child should not be playing with the phone in class, period.  So I hope this is a lesson for him, that it should be kept in his bag or locker and not taken out during class!\n\nSecondly, the teacher made a poor choice and broke the phone while it was in her care.  She should have reported that to the office, herself, and owned up to the mistake.  She shouldn't be going directly to you to resolve the issue.  The school owes a replacement of the phone he lost when it was broken.  No loaners.  No brand new phone.  Whatever the value of his phone (brand and age of item) is what you get back.", "NTA, she\u2019s pissed because she messed up and didn\u2019t want her bosses to know. It most likely was not kindness that brought her to your door - wanting to keep it between you and her is more likely. She should be grateful you aren\u2019t pressing charges ***im not suggesting pressing charge for a mistake but tsome people would take it that far", "NTA\n\nProtocols exist for a reason. She didn\u2019t follow them and look what happened. It\u2019s good that she\u2019s willing to pay for it without a fight but if that\u2019s an issue, perhaps the school needs new protocols.", "NTA...she screwed up, she should take her lumps with some dignity. \n\nIt's not like this is going to be a career-ender. She might get doinked for violating policy...note in her record...but I doubt it will be worse than that. Technically, the moment she left school grounds she was stealing the phone...but let's not go there. She goofed, she should 'fess up. This is like people offering to pay you directly for hitting your car to avoid insurance, then haggling over the price of the fixes.\n\nAnd it's not exactly like she's setting a good example to her students about accepting responsibility for your actions. You MIGHT point that out to her.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t come to you directly to apologize out of respect, she did it to hide her inappropriate actions and their consequences from her employer - which she made abundantly clear when she spread shit about you and the situation immediately afterwards.\n\nI also don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for a phone not to be given back at the end of the school day; you could have needed to contact him urgently about changes to how he was getting home, there could have been an emergency, etc. confiscating it during class is absolutely fine, as is any other reasonable punishment, but leaving your kid without an easy way to contact you or emergency services if needed is not on.", "NTA\n\nWhile taking it home is an honest mistake, the moment she noticed she should have put it in a safe place. Instead, somehow her toddler got ahold of it and cracked the screen to the put the ink was coming through. Even if this is how it happened, she should have told the school herself. It sounds like she is more mad at the school knowing.", "NTA. She should not have taken the phone home.", "NTA but personally if she offered to pay I would have kept it under raps.

School policy issues aside, she did put the phone in her bag. It did end up going home with her, and it did end up breaking, quite badly. Regardless of human error, her kid got into her work bag. The phone broke. It\u2019s awesome that she owned up to it and offered to pay, but the school should also be aware.

Now that you rightfully reported the incident, she's badmouthing you.\n\nShe clearly lacks professionalism.", "NTA\n\nShe messed with her own career by not following protocol and turning the device into the office by the end of the school day **and** by allowing her toddler to get a hold of it.", "NTA. Taking it home is a mistake. The biggest issue is why her toddler broke the phone. She should have kept it in a safe spot.", "NTA it's called theft and should be criminally prosecuted.", "NTA.\n\nIt's understandable that the teacher is upset that you reported her after she tried to settle the matter with you on the quiet, but not for the reason you might think.\n\nTeacher was unprofessional enough to realise she had forgotten to secure the phone and decide that taking it home was an ok solution.\n\nShe knew how to get in contact with you, and still took the phone home instead of to your house.\n\nThis was after she decided not to secure the phone on the premises by calling the principal, the secretary or whoever she needed to call to be able to lock the phone away safely, but to just head on home.\n\nSo the teacher had a couple of ways to deal with the problem of being in possession of unsecured confiscated property on a weekend, but decided to go into the realm of theft or unlawful possession of a students property, depending on the law where you are.\n\nThen, once she got the phone home, the teacher failed to put it somewhere a toddler couldn't reach it - I don't know what the toddlers are like where you live, but around here even the brightest and most agile of them are completely hopeless at stealing small items that are properly secured, especially when they don't know the small item exists.\n\nBy the time the teacher got to your place with the wrecked phone, the explanatory arse-covering disclosure email should already have been sent by her to her school boss so that she wasn't operating in secrecy. Messing up is bad, but messing up and trying to cover your tracks is worse.\n\nA bunch of mistakes compounding on each other to provide an \"ohhhh noooo\" outcome can happen to people - but this wasn't a normal office, this was a teacher who had taken a student's phone away from them according to a confiscation protocol.\n\nThere's trust involved in the position of teacher, as well as legal problems with confiscation of property where the item ends up going missing (that is, not entered into the system but also not in possession of the rightful owner, which is probably you), and this teacher would have been aware of the problems, but still did nothing about it until after the item was broken while being somewhere it wasn't supposed to be (in her personal possession without anyone else's knowledge).\n\nThen the teacher tried to sweep it under the carpet when it was too late, and in any case you only have her word for how it got broken and whether or not she was going through the phone when it was broken.\n\nSo yeh, of course she was upset and mad with you - after her bad decisions and the loss of a valuable item, you went and behaved honestly and reasonably and got the school involved. If she'd already sent an email, your email wouldn't have been a problem for her.\n\nOn top of it all, the good teacher decided that it was ok for her to buttonhole a relative of yours who works at her workplace, whilst at work (so not in a casual social setting, where it still wouldn't have been ok) and accuse you of victimising her, and claimed to have behaved properly herself.\n\nThe teacher should be facing consequences, and that is not your fault at all.\n\nAlso, the item wasn't a valuable souvenir or anything like that - it was a phone with your and your son's information on it. I'd have thought that trying to avoid any situation where she could be accused of mishandling somebody's personal and identifying information would have been one of the things that occurred to her during the debacle.", "NTA - yes she made a mistake taking it home but how did her toddler get hold of it?  She needed to replace immediately. make sure they do not take revenge on your son.", "NTA. I don't see why the teacher put the phone in her handbag during the class rather than leaving it on or next to the bag to take to the office. Next mistake was forgetting it was in the handbag (that bit is kind of understandable as she was probably rushing from class to class). Third mistake (or not) - how did it get into the toddler's hands? Assuming she is watching the toddler all the time, being a toddler quite important since they can clearly do some damage to things as well as to themselves, did she take the phone at to look at and put it down within toddler's reach or did she put the handbag within toddler's reach and not close it, or did she give the phone to the toddler? Final mistake was not reporting it herself. Given she has broken a rule, coming to you first to offer payment and then complaining that you had told the school shows she wanted to hide her misconduct from the school - this is not the action of a \"good\" teacher but of someone who is dishonest.", "NTA- the phone should have been returned to your son by the end of class or the end of the day.

Why her toddler had it in the first place? Why she took it home?

Frankly, I\u2019m not only disturbed that she \u201cforgot\u201d she was not only in possession of someone else\u2019s rather expensive property so easily, but that it was made so easily accessible to her toddler which NEVER should have happened. There are instances where \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll pay for it\u201d are not enough.

In addition, why the hell are phones being kept AFTER school hours? \n\nConfiscating a phone during school hours is fair. A rule is a rule.

How many are home alone for several hours or longer after school? How many students have health conditions they may need the use of a phone for after school? \n\nHome phone are not terribly common anymore. Why is a school making a unilateral parenting choice for children OUTSIDE of their school time? Why was this phone held until the teacher was leaving WORK for the day? Why was there opportunity for it to be taken to her home in the first place? The phone should have been returned as soon as classes were done for the day. \n\nThis child or any other child could experience a real emergency and now have zero access to a phone in order to call for help. Are parent made aware when a phone is confiscated? What if a child is supposed to call their parent when they arrive home and that call never gets made because of this? You have a parent freaking out not knowing if their child made it home. \n\nThe school NEEDED to be made aware and very serious changes need to be made to this confiscation rule. \n\nPhones should be locked in a secure location NOT the personal property of an employee and promptly returned at the end of school hours. Not the day after. Not 48 hours after. The day of.

I have a lot of medical issues and I often accidentally throw my phones. It's not fun but it's been less expensive just smacking a pop socket on the back and not using a case. I also didn't cheap out on cases but got the OtterBox and highly rated for milspec ones. I didn't make for pretty I went for durable. The difference between 2 years with a phone case and 2 without? The new phone I got was a birthday present not a need. It was a nice surprise. The 6 phones in a year before that convinced me to go naked as it were.\n\nAll the same model (until this one which is newer but still a Samsung. Samsung's durability is why I go for them because when they do not forget batteries get hot and expand their good.)", "Why did I hear that in the same pitch as NO WIRE HANGERS.", "As a person that doesn't use a phonecase, there are ways to survive without one.\nI don't use one because i honestly don't like the feeling and it kind of makes it bulkier in my pockets and a bit harder to slide out of the pockets.\n\nThe best solution would be to not drop it, but that's not realistic. The second best solution is buying one with gorilla glass. It's really, really sturdy. You will have to compromise though, since gorilla glass is usually on expensive phones, so i usually buy old-ish expensive phones. Like, at the start of this year i bought a phone that came out in 2019.", "I once went down a slide with my phone in my back pocket in Canadian winter. When I stood up at the bottom the entire screen had shattered inside the case. After that, my mom started us on Otterbox and Lifeproof cases and I\u2019ve had less issues.", "And I had a tempered glass screen protector and dropped it about a foot (fell out of my pocket when I was on the toilet). The glass shattered and the screen did the pretty colors thing. It somehow hit the edge just right. It's really a crapshoot.", "No they were asking where on the actual phone would the IMEI be found. That way they can match it with the IMEI on the receipt/contract given when it was purchased.", "Schools are not liable for personal property damages that occur on school property. \n\nTeachers are 100% liable for damages caused to student property under their care.", "OMG. I didn't know this. Thank you.", "Holy shit!\n\nI was about to post that my S22 doesn't have that. No logo, just the word 'Samsung'. But, then I got out another light and it's there. \n\nNo indication that it exists under normal lighting. Wow!", "She could've just put the sons sim card in the phone", "Unfortunately \ud83d\ude15", ">The teacher has to either leave her elementary school classroom to bring a phone to the office in the middle of the day, or else put it in her bag to bring down on her way home and hope this exact type of inevitable human error never happens?? \n\nOr...just stick it in her desk with the other confiscated stuff, as teachers have done for 200 years", "All well and good but said teacher should have made sure her toddler never had access to a phone that was not her property.", "There are a lot of schools where theft would be an issue. She was supposed to take it to the office. She likely put it in her bag and was planning on dropping it there. But she forgot.", "Yep. For me, we started switching a bit (just for math and science) in 4th and 5th grade, a bit more in 6th grade (still elementary for me), then starting in 7th (junior high) we would switch for every class.", "Actually it was great. We had different chairs so everyone picked had assigned desks and the chair that was right for them. When we did change rooms it was basically the same type of chairs, but we had to look for a desk and hope we got the chairs that were right for us. \n\nOut classroom was also decorated and personalized by us. As in we painted the mural etc.\n\nThe teachers have their own office and pick up what they need in between classes. Laptops are easily connected in each classroom. And all the students have laptops or iPads issued through the school.", "It gets even more fun than that! There are several continental models; the most common point of contention seems to be between splitting North and South America as different continents or not. See also why a lot of Spanish-speaking people from the Americas say USians we are all Americans; we\u2019re taught there\u2019s a single continent called Am\u00e9rica, split in North/Central/South regions. Regardless of the model, though, Central America is either a region in the American continent or a region in the North American continent; as far as my own education goes, pretty much 2/3rds of Mexico are in the North American region.", "There is an absolutely a logical reason she said nothing to admin - who wants to admit to their employer that they made a big fuck up, even accidentally. \n\nHeck, I am in the midst of a continuing ed course related my profession and they dedicated a whole section to saying basically \"if you fuck up, report it to your higher ups for help instead of trying to fix it yourself.\" People are naturally inclined to avoid negative consequences.", "I\u2019m not a teacher yet but every school I\u2019ve student taught at takes confiscated phones straight to the office w/ a note signed by the teacher, time of confiscation, and students\u2019 details. I really don\u2019t understand how she just \u201caccidentally\u201d took it home. Maybe she took it off him in class, but why would she put it in her pocket or in her bag? Idk that\u2019s *weird* to me, it doesn\u2019t need to be on her person, women\u2019s pockets have precious little space, no way in hell could I keep *two* phones in any of my teacher clothes, and if I have a pocket I\u2019m putting my phone in it, not a student\u2019s. \n\nAnd then on top of a mess-up like that, unless I worked for the actual grinch I\u2019d want admin to hear my side of the story *fucking asap*, I\u2019d want to go over why it happened, and I\u2019d probably be right onto them about organising a better confiscation system to prevent something similar happening again. (Not to shift blame, but just so all confiscated phones are tracked. Which again, I don\u2019t understand why the school has a confiscation policy without a system for it. That\u2019s insane. Phones are expensive, parents are angry, accidents happen, *protect your ass*.)\n\n\nNone of this teacher\u2019s behaviour or story is congruent with someone genuinely remorseful, who wants to clear the air over an honest to god fuck up. There\u2019s a lot of holes in her conduct.", "Tbh I don\u2019t even understand taking it for a week depending on the grade. Maybe if it was a younger kid who has a phone with no service and doesn\u2019t actually need the phone to communicate. With older kids who actually use the phone for communication, I think it should be given to them at the end of the day and email/calling the parent. IK teachers don\u2019t want to deal with the hassle, but phones are a vital form of communication now. You can\u2019t just take that from the (parents) kids possession for a week. Phones are no longer a new thing, and ik it sounds harsh, but don\u2019t they know what they\u2019re signing up for (in regards to phones) at this point?", "Dropped a phone and attempted to catch it on the edge of the desk cracked the glass screen protector. It's because I basically pushed the corner of the desk into the screen.", "This is exactly what happened to one of mine.  I always have them in Otterboxes because I accidentally fling my phone around on a regular basis.  But one day it fell face down on a rock.  My phone screen didn't stand a chance.", "This all makes sense. I apologize for my hysteria. \ud83d\udc4c", "If I may make a suggestion, I don't know exactly your medical issues obviously, but when I got out of the hospital with nerve damage in my hands and wasn't able to hold things very well I switched to a ring on the back from a popsocket, it's a lifesaver and the kind I got can still prop my phone up on the table\n\nIf losing control of your hands/fingers is the reason you're flinging your phone about, which it sounds like is the case, it might be worth looking into.", "Yeah, I love me some gorilla glass, for true.", "Oh man, that's awful. I guess it IS a crapshoot!", "Normally I'd say dial *#06#  on the device, but with the screen damaged they might not be able to see the IMEI when it comes up.", "Samsung and most other Androids have it printed in small letters on the back, iPhone will have it n tiny letters on the SIM card tray (with the exception of the new 14 which does not have a SIM tray).", "It can be really hard to make out unless you have a light on it. Even then it's super small.", "How paranoid is this lol", "Or carry it to the office in her hand. There\u2019s no plausible reason to put it in her bag. Also she should have prevented her child from touching it", "Yes, hence the point of *locking* it away. If this were an honest mistake, she'd have informed her boss herself or would have been annoyed, not downright belligerent. Forgetting has cost her, and that happens to everyone. It doesn't change that OP did *nothing wrong.*", "I went to a middle school. Grades 6 through 8. All of my classes were in different rooms starting grade 6.", "I'd like to see a shift towards that. It would help cut down on some of the teachers' worries about kids snooping when they shouldn't in the teacher's stuff for other classes and the like.", "Americans are definitely taught that Mexico is part of North America but the Caribbean and Central America are usually grouped as distinct regions because of culture. Many US Americans view American as referring to the ABSENCE of a country name rather than a claim to both continents (also it's a name Europeans gave us with the use of America as a country name being maybe 100 years old). In other words, it's the denonym because there is no other name. Someone from North America is North American and someone from South America is South American. You'd really only use the term \"the Americas\" when talking about European colonization of the continents.", "Of course no one wants to admit they fucked up- but it\u2019s what adults do. \n\nShe\u2019s putting herself- and the school AND the district- in a vulnerable position by doing this without backup. \u201cDon\u2019t spend large amounts of money on a student\u201d is a pretty basic understanding of boundaries by anyone who has a teaching license. The fallout from that choice has the potential to end her career. \n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have taken it home. She shouldn\u2019t have left it where her toddler could damage it. And once it WAS damaged, she absolutely shouldn\u2019t have tried to handle it under the radar like this. \n\nI get it. No one likes to admit they screwed up. But it\u2019s what adults who want to keep their job and keep their teaching license do!!", "No worries. It's something I didn't actually expect to find but I wondered so took a risk since I had budgeted for a new phone in a few weeks anyway. Surprised me.", "I tried the rings but they dislocated my fingers more. My health issues are numerous but the neurological issues are spinal and brain injury stuff. In my case my hands lock up so I hold onto the pop socket. It hasn't folded back down since the second day I got it but it's otherwise worked really well. I appreciate the suggestion because it's definitely worth considering and I can see how with less crappy connective tissues it would be much better", "TIL. Thats a neat trick!", "Is OP sure that the teacher the actual teacher? No plastic surgery? Did you compare the fingerprints and dna results?", "I mean... If you broke your phone and a student happened to have the exact same model, this would be a clever but really shitty thing to do.", "I have never had a fixed classroom past 1st grade. This is wild to me.", "Perfectly fair. I'm glad you found something that works and if you've tried the other option then even better on ya! Wishing you well in the hopes that things are easier in the future.", "Not when you're offering to pay for the replacement lol. Just buy yourself a new phone why risk the hit to your reputation for no benefit."]}
