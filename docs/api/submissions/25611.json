My wife is a SAHM and I work as a software engineer. I work remotely so it hasn't been that awful to split responsibilities. \n\nWe decided that we would be taking turns this weekend to take time for ourselves. Yesterday, my wife went with her friends for a girls' day out. She said she'd be back by around 8 pm and to not wait for her to eat dinner together. At around 8:30 pm I called her because she still hadn't come home. She told me her friends were planning to have a sleepover as well and she requested me to take care of our baby tonight. Before I could reply, she hung up on me. The thing is our daughter, Rose, is colic so she doesn't sleep well. we usually take turns taking care of her because she cries a lot and it is very hard for one person to watch over her. I had to stay up all night yesterday with Rose. \n\nMy wife came home at 4 am and she was completely drunk. she just blacked out on the bed immediately after coming home. At around 8 am, I got us fries, nuggets, burgers, and drinks for both of us(a strawberry milkshake and cold coffee for myself; a blueberry soda and espresso for her). At around 9 am my wife woke up and said she felt very sick and asked me if I could take care of Rose for a few more hours so that she could eat breakfast and rest for a little bit. I was exhausted at that point because I hadn't slept all night yesterday but agreed. I was really annoyed with her at that point though because today was supposed to be a break for me and her getting drunk wasn't part of the plan. We both had breakfast and she went back to bed. I was scrolling insta while waiting for my wife to wake up. At 1 pm, she hadn't woken up yet and I ended up having to cancel my lunch plan with my friends. I was beyond angry at that point but decided to wait for her to wake up instead of waking her up. \n\nShe finally woke up at 3 pm. I handed Rose to my wife and told her I'm going to the basement to watch a movie and take a nap. I also asked her not to disturb me until I came out on my own unless there was an emergency. \n\nI made myself a few grilled cheese sandwiches and took the strawberry shake with me to the basement. I set up an air mattress and some pillows, then locked the basement door. Then I watched a few episodes of my favorite show. ended up falling asleep midway through the show and woke up around 7 pm to 40 missed calls from my wife. when I went up to check on her and the baby, she said that I was very irresponsible and rude for leaving her alone with the baby for so long. I got mad and told her \"at least I didn't get blackout drunk and leave you to take care of a colic baby for more than a day on your own without any sleep.\" She started crying and told me I was horrible for guilting her like that.  \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693126254, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162l4pw/aita_i_locked_myself_in_the_basement_for_4_hours/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She abandoned the responsibility and didn't even have the decency to communicate her plans properly just repeatedly leave you in positions where you had no choice. You take a rest for a few hours and you're the problem? You communicated that you were hungry, tired and needed a rest. You took very minimal time to satisfy those needs and she's trying to manipulate the situation because she absolutely knows she was so in the wrong every step of the way.", "NTA. I dont get all this people judging OP. They both needed the day off. They had a deal. She broke the deal. He was very nice to her and give her more free hours from HIS own time. And yet she cant deal with her own baby for an afternoon?!\nI get babies are exausting, comes with the territory. Mom is a SAHM, needs a break. But, OP is exausted too!. He was taking care of his baby (who doesnt sleep well) for more than 24H all alone! The mom needs a reality check. She was the one who choose to get drunk when she full knew that the next day she needed to take care of a baby.", "NTA based on the information here. She should have communicated her needs well in advance if she needed more time than she originally said. And you two agreed in advance that you needed time too.", "definitely not the AH.\n\nShe is taking the piss, sorry you have every right to be angry.\n\nShe got blind drunk and stayed out till 4am, ruined your day and has the Gaul to call you irresponsible.", "Your wife is so wrong, really stunningly wrong, first for staying out until four, second for drinking so hard she was still feeling bad at 1 pm, and then for having the chutzpah to yell at you for taking a four hour nap\n\nAND ALSO at the same time it\u2019s just super duper hard to have a tiny baby with colic.  If you can afford a night nanny for a couple nights it might be worth paying for some respite, which will feel even better than the satisfaction of knowing your wife is the AH. \n\nNTA, and hang in there!", "Absolutely NTA, way to break the agreement on her side, and then the nerve to complain you left her alone for 4 hours with the baby, after your marathon the day before.", "NTA.", "I\u2019m surprised your wife stayed out partying till 4am with a child that young! Maybe she needed it but she knew that she\u2019d agreed to have the baby the next day. She needs to give you some more \u2018me time\u2019 on another weekend.", "Definitely NTA.", "NTA. I'm single, no kids, and never have I ever drunkenly gone to an adult sleepover. Yea, drinking sneaks up on you sometimes, but your wife was extremely irresponsible. You have a two month old! It'd be a while different story if you didn't have a newborn, and she kept you posted as she got too drunk to parent that night.", "NTA but you really should have woken her up, told her you have plans and just got on with it.", "NTA but you two need to talk, not argue, this out.", "It sounds like both of you are under a lot of pressure at the moment and you're not communicating as well as you need to be. I suspect that it is not typical for your wife to go out with friends, come home drunk and leave you to look after the baby. It may even be the first time she's been able to have a night out with her friends since the baby was born. Likewise, I assume it's not typical of you to be the one who stays up all night looking after the baby and then needing to continue looking after the baby the next day, whereas that is probably a much more familiar experience for your wife.\n\nYou weren't an AH for taking some time off in the basement. You weren't an AH for reminding her that she changed plans on you without even letting her know. You might have been an AH depending on what precisely you said.\n\nTalk to your wife. It's hard to get downtime when the baby is so young. You both need to be honest about what you need, and you have to have agreements about what the plan is when the plan is changing. If you'd known your wife was going to stay out late and not be around on Sunday, you might not have made lunch plans that you had to cancel. But if she didn't feel safe telling you that that is what she wanted, because you might refuse or otherwise attempt to argue her out of it, then you'll get this kind of end result and it will erode the trust both of you need to have in your relationship.\n\nNAH, if you'll actually be honest with each other.", "NAH, to me this just sounds like two overworked parents that are grasping at straws and trying to get a break, unfortunately at each other's expense. \n\nDo you have any family or friends that could help you out and take care of the baby for a few hours so the two of you can spend some time alone and maybe take a nap together?", "What\u2019s happening.\n\nPoor baby.\n\nTbh I feel like saying both of you are not good parents.\n\nI know you are exhausted but leaving a sick hungover woman with a colicky baby is not good for the baby either.\n\nSo.\n\nESH.\n\nAgain, poor baby.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
