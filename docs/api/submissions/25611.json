My wife is a SAHM and I work as a software engineer. I work remotely so it hasn't been that awful to split responsibilities. \n\nWe decided that we would be taking turns this weekend to take time for ourselves. Yesterday, my wife went with her friends for a girls' day out. She said she'd be back by around 8 pm and to not wait for her to eat dinner together. At around 8:30 pm I called her because she still hadn't come home. She told me her friends were planning to have a sleepover as well and she requested me to take care of our baby tonight. Before I could reply, she hung up on me. The thing is our daughter, Rose, is colic so she doesn't sleep well. we usually take turns taking care of her because she cries a lot and it is very hard for one person to watch over her. I had to stay up all night yesterday with Rose. \n\nMy wife came home at 4 am and she was completely drunk. she just blacked out on the bed immediately after coming home. At around 8 am, I got us fries, nuggets, burgers, and drinks for both of us(a strawberry milkshake and cold coffee for myself; a blueberry soda and espresso for her). At around 9 am my wife woke up and said she felt very sick and asked me if I could take care of Rose for a few more hours so that she could eat breakfast and rest for a little bit. I was exhausted at that point because I hadn't slept all night yesterday but agreed. I was really annoyed with her at that point though because today was supposed to be a break for me and her getting drunk wasn't part of the plan. We both had breakfast and she went back to bed. I was scrolling insta while waiting for my wife to wake up. At 1 pm, she hadn't woken up yet and I ended up having to cancel my lunch plan with my friends. I was beyond angry at that point but decided to wait for her to wake up instead of waking her up. \n\nShe finally woke up at 3 pm. I handed Rose to my wife and told her I'm going to the basement to watch a movie and take a nap. I also asked her not to disturb me until I came out on my own unless there was an emergency. \n\nI made myself a few grilled cheese sandwiches and took the strawberry shake with me to the basement. I set up an air mattress and some pillows, then locked the basement door. Then I watched a few episodes of my favorite show. ended up falling asleep midway through the show and woke up around 7 pm to 40 missed calls from my wife. when I went up to check on her and the baby, she said that I was very irresponsible and rude for leaving her alone with the baby for so long. I got mad and told her \"at least I didn't get blackout drunk and leave you to take care of a colic baby for more than a day on your own without any sleep.\" She started crying and told me I was horrible for guilting her like that.  \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693126254, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162l4pw/aita_i_locked_myself_in_the_basement_for_4_hours/", "score": 569, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I suspect that it is not typical for your wife to go out with friends, come home drunk and leave you to look after the baby. It may even be the first time she's been able to have a night out with her friends since the baby was born. Likewise, I assume it's not typical of you to be the one who stays up all night looking after the baby and then needing to continue looking after the baby the next day, whereas that is probably a much more familiar experience for your wife.\n\nYou weren't an AH for taking some time off in the basement. You weren't an AH for reminding her that she changed plans on you without even letting her know. You might have been an AH depending on what precisely you said.\n\nTalk to your wife.

If you'd known your wife was going to stay out late and not be around on Sunday, you might not have made lunch plans that you had to cancel.

She acted irresponsibly then had the guts to try and guilt you for a few hours nap. \n\nYou have a system setup to care for your baby. She blew that all to hell and you stepped up. But when you then want to rest she pulls the crying \u201cnot fair\u201d crap. \n\nNope.", "Ok i just read until baby 2 months and she came home drunk.No just no.You are still people you need time to yourselves but 2 months?My kid didn\u2019t come off my boob at that time.Having a kid means sacrificing a lot,and getting drunk with an\nInfant is not it,especially with a colicky baby.She needs to grow up and step up", "NTA, but your wife sure is. After you both calm down, maybe discuss getting a babysitter occasionally so you can both have time to yourselves, alone or together, and no one has to worry about the other one being overwhelmed with the baby.", "NTA. From this story, she broke the deal you both agreed to, and put an unfair load on you. Being a SAHM can be very hard and maybe she needed a much longer break, but she went about it the wrong way. You both work hard, and need to work together to make this work.", "NTA, OP you sound like a great parent", "NTA she intentionally put you in a position where you would have to be up all night and she told you on the phone so there was nothing you could do about it. You missed your time out on your own because she was so drunk she didn\u2019t wake up", "NTA!", "Nta your wife is incredibly selfish, good luck in this relationship if she somehow thinks she\u2019s the victim here", "God help you all", "No she is the AITA!!! She is the irresponsible for staying out that late when you have a baby. I understand everyone wants some time away but she should of come home at 8 like she said. \nI have a 2 week old and if my boyfriend did this I'd be fuming!! Not acceptable. You going into the basement is reasonable!!!", ">She was the one who choose to get drunk when she full knew that the next day she needed to take care of a baby.\n\nI\u2019d hazard a guess that, consciously or subconsciously, choosing to get drunk was her way of getting out of taking care of the baby the next day. She could have proposed a free weekend in exchange for the OP having the next weekend free of baby duty, but then she\u2019d have had to fulfil her end of the bargain.", "Chutzpah", "Those damn Gauls. - some Salad guy", "So, I came into this thread pleasantly surprised, then I saw your comment...and scrolled to the bottom.  What, directly the fuck, is wrong with people?", "Sexism, pure and simple.\n\nA bunch of pissed off women will just assume the worst possible context to justify anything. E.g. that she is somehow desparately exhausted but he has been out every weekend for the last 6 months and its finally her \"turn\".", "I wonder how some of the threads would look if original posts in them didn\u2019t mention things like sex/gender.", "Exactly this. OP, you need to set a clear and agreed time for the next possible opportunity to have some time to yourself. It is so important for both parents to get rest and be able to reset whenever possible. She had a great time this weekend, and a nice long sleep, next time, do what you have planned and reinforce the no contact unless it\u2019s an emergency. \n\nSharing responsibility with a colic baby drains both parents, and you both need the opportunity to recover.", "This story doesn\u2019t add up to me. The burgers at 8am is one. The next is wife being gone so long with no mention of baby feeding. Not saying she\u2019s breastfeeding but at 2 months either way she\u2019s lactating and having to deal with the fallout from that. You have to manage that so you don\u2019t get an infection. This seems written by someone with no knowledge of that whole process", "That jumped out at me too! Where I am, you can't get any of that before 10:30-11.", "Jesus Christ she went out and got drunk, was probably just reveling in the bit of freedom and got carried away. Manic episodes? Based on what. Talk about jumping to conclusions", "Wouldn't matter if it was.", "If you honestly believe this is over-the-top then you need to go out and actually interact with people.\n\nThere's a reason we have the phrase \"truth is stranger than fiction\"", "Formula. Also, those are foods good for hangovers. He got hungry, so he got stuff he wanted that would help his wife as well. Just because they weren't \"breakfast\" foods doesn't mean he can't eat them for breakfast.", "If she knew she had to care for her child, she shouldn\u2019t get herself drunk? She\u2019s just irresponsible.", "No, what a terrible partner he has. She made him cancel his plans because she can\u2019t control herself. She is lucky him and her baby were there when she woke up from her stupor.", "If she is Breast feeding she shouldn\u2019t be drinking, did you hit your head or something?", "But equally, they had made an agreement that the following day would be a break for him too and he was forced to cancel plans due to her irresponsibility and moving of goalposts", "So how does all that mean he\u2019s an A for taking 4 hours afterwards so he could recharge a bit?", "So she got black out drunk and is going to breastfeed? Thats abuse.", ">The thing is our daughter, Rose, is colic so she doesn't sleep well. ***we usually take turns taking care of her because she cries a lot*** and it is very hard for one person to watch over her.\n\nIt's right there in the post.\n\nAnd if she's breastfeeding, she shouldn't be drinking.\n\nYou made one hell of an all-mighty stretch to make OP the villain, didn't you?", "I agree. I have 3 kids. Never once did either me or my partner not share parenting our kids. Through hangovers, sickness, tiredness from work - you just do it. Both of you.", "Caesar will capture Vercingetorix any day now...", "Gaul is another word for horse in German, I'm still laughing.", "Scroll to the bottom of any AITA post and there will be some wild takes", "As a pregnant woman, it\u2019s probably true that she hasn\u2019t been out at all throughout her pregnancy. I missed out on 4 weddings and 6 birthdays during my pregnancy, lol, I just felt like hell.\n\nStill, her mistake isn\u2019t that she wanted a night out, it was not communicating it transparently and trapping her husband basically. So she\u2019s TA for sure.", "He also stated be made himself a few grilled cheese sandwiches and a strawberry shake to the basement \ud83d\ude33 what is going on here?!", "No, she went out, got drunk, stayed out without notice til 4 in the morning, staggered in drunk, made unreasonable demands of her spouse, all while having a newborn.  That is bizarre behavior.           OP didn't mention a long term struggle with any kind of alcohol abuse, which suggests it's not typical, either.   I would be very, very concerned about her.", "If she hasn\u2019t been drinking for essentially an entire year, it absolutely can affect her differently than it has in the past. She probably wouldn\u2019t be able to handle as much and the hangover could be worse.", "Bet his name his brick.", "I'll bet the only reason OP is the AH here is the fact he's a man.", "Just build a wa\u2026 make it *two* walls", "Yes, exactly. It's ok and reasonable for her to want some time to herself to have fun and let loose. But she does need to communicate, make plans, and then stick to the agreed upon plans with her husband. Acting like this is the best way to alienate an otherwise (seemingly at least) supportive partner. \n\nI have two children as well so I get it. It's hard for everyone, but you need to compromise and communicate.", "She most likely intended to go for just a short while, got a little tipsy and before you know it, one thing leads to another and it is stupid O'clock and she's drunk as hell.  Then the next day she feels like death from a killer hangover as she's not used to that and was probably way behind on her sleep from the last few weeks.\n\nI'm honestly sympathetic to all of that, its a mistake, but one anyone could find themselves making.  It really sucks for her partner, but he did the right thing by avoiding engaging in an argument about it when she was out, when she got home drunk and then when she was hungover as hell.\n\nAs you say she was already the AH for that chain of events, but that isn't that serious in the grand scheme of things.  The really dangerous part is basically mistreating her partner for huge periods of time, ruining his plans, robbing him of a break and then having the audacity to be upset with him when he tries to recover from the damage she caused.\n\nInstead of 40 calls harassing him to stop sleeping and go bail her out yet again, it should have been 40 apologies, promises that next weekend would be his turn, promises that she knows what she did was wrong and that it won't happen again.  Getting that last bit entirely back to front is a serious problem, as it shows she basically only cares for her wants and needs and takes her partner entirely for granted.", "If a stranger on the internet knows this, all the more she should have been cognisant of her drinking when she knew she had a husband and child counting on her back home. I don't get how this is an excuse for her behaviour.", "Hangover headaches are self inflicted, so they don't get sympathy.", "Sleep deprivation is also hellish (I get dizzy and feel nauseated after just one shitty night of sleep) and a sleep deprived parent is not good for the baby.  Quite dangerous, actually.  At least OP's actions helped alleviate his condition, a condition that was imposed upon him, making it possible for the baby to once again have a \"healthy\" parent.  \n\nOP, your wife was very selfish.  Had she needed, or even just wanted that much time to herself, she should have arranged it with you beforehand so you could plan better, maybe bring a friend or family member over to help while she was taking time for herself.  You are NTA.", ">Hangover headaches can be hellish\n\nIf only there is a prerequisite behaviour to getting a hangover that she could have chosen to avoid.", "I learned this lesson the same way OP\u2019s wife presumably just did.", ">Sleep deprivation is also hellish\n\nI concur, when I get less than 4 hrs it's hell to keep myself awake, plus I get headaches and dizziness.\n\nIt's even worse when I've got work the next day.", "Her decision leading up to this, when she was sober enough to call OP and demand that she stay the night out, as well as her reaction the next day were all unacceptable.", "She was probably well into her cups by that 8:30 phone call. I remember that first time I went out after giving birth and how great it felt to be out and free and have time with my friends. I didn\u2019t realize how much I\u2019d missed it and needed it."]}
