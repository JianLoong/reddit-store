My wife is a SAHM and I work as a software engineer. I work remotely so it hasn't been that awful to split responsibilities. \n\nWe decided that we would be taking turns this weekend to take time for ourselves. Yesterday, my wife went with her friends for a girls' day out. She said she'd be back by around 8 pm and to not wait for her to eat dinner together. At around 8:30 pm I called her because she still hadn't come home. She told me her friends were planning to have a sleepover as well and she requested me to take care of our baby tonight. Before I could reply, she hung up on me. The thing is our daughter, Rose, is colic so she doesn't sleep well. we usually take turns taking care of her because she cries a lot and it is very hard for one person to watch over her. I had to stay up all night yesterday with Rose. \n\nMy wife came home at 4 am and she was completely drunk. she just blacked out on the bed immediately after coming home. At around 8 am, I got us fries, nuggets, burgers, and drinks for both of us(a strawberry milkshake and cold coffee for myself; a blueberry soda and espresso for her). At around 9 am my wife woke up and said she felt very sick and asked me if I could take care of Rose for a few more hours so that she could eat breakfast and rest for a little bit. I was exhausted at that point because I hadn't slept all night yesterday but agreed. I was really annoyed with her at that point though because today was supposed to be a break for me and her getting drunk wasn't part of the plan. We both had breakfast and she went back to bed. I was scrolling insta while waiting for my wife to wake up. At 1 pm, she hadn't woken up yet and I ended up having to cancel my lunch plan with my friends. I was beyond angry at that point but decided to wait for her to wake up instead of waking her up. \n\nShe finally woke up at 3 pm. I handed Rose to my wife and told her I'm going to the basement to watch a movie and take a nap. I also asked her not to disturb me until I came out on my own unless there was an emergency. \n\nI made myself a few grilled cheese sandwiches and took the strawberry shake with me to the basement. I set up an air mattress and some pillows, then locked the basement door. Then I watched a few episodes of my favorite show. ended up falling asleep midway through the show and woke up around 7 pm to 40 missed calls from my wife. when I went up to check on her and the baby, she said that I was very irresponsible and rude for leaving her alone with the baby for so long. I got mad and told her \"at least I didn't get blackout drunk and leave you to take care of a colic baby for more than a day on your own without any sleep.\" She started crying and told me I was horrible for guilting her like that.  \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693126254, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162l4pw/aita_i_locked_myself_in_the_basement_for_4_hours/", "score": 5729, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
