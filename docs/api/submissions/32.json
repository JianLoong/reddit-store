Everyone in the situation needs to start acting their age\u2026 14 or 44. Neither age should be cursing each other or making fun of someone else. She\u2019s paying the rent, if not cleaning more often than kids and doing yard or other house chores, so having the kids do chores like sometimes cooking is fair. Parents/stepparents have the right to ask reasonable requests, like cooking, of their kids or stepkids.", "Gran is Scottish. Sounds like a perfect time for her to dust off her favorite haggis recipe.", "Brain touches bones....", "Her fondness for organ meat is why the dad puts up with her.", "my guess is its not about literally whether meat has ever touched a bone - its a food sensitivity/food aversion thing. I can't eat meat on the bone and cant just shred meat off a bone to eat - even thinking about it right now makes me literally gag. it feels like my throat is closing over and also the though of the bones in my hands makes me want to chop them off \n\ngiven the food not being able to touch etc it sounds like stepmother has diagnosable food disorder type issues - however obvs like.. taking that out on a child and being rude af about other peoples food isnt appropriate/makes stepmother an ah", "i think the snake does the talking for him.", "She knows how to cook does it for my half sister a lot of the time.", "Tbh I don\u2019t know what he sees in her lol", "I know this post just makes me so sad for OPs grandma. One, because she seems to have convinced herself she is in the wrong for not making something additional but especially because what an incredible and authentic meal she probably grew up with it sounds like that she put hours of work in just to have it essentially called gross and not worth stepmoms time. I don\u2019t even like Yorkshire Pudding but I wanna come over and eat it and tell her it\u2019s incredible", "She isn\u2019t paying rent my dad pays for everything and she just sits around saying I could have done better. I\u2019m not going to let her walk over me. I deserve respect too.", "Having a higher score in consecutive days not dead earns you nothing", "My grandma loved haggis,  head cheese and blood pudding.", "That is EXACTLY what crossed my mind.", "Haggis for the win!", "I guess I get this hypothetically and don\u2019t wanna knock on a potential disorder but the way it is described is what throws me. I have never ever able to eat meat off the bone either, and for many many years could never could have any of my food on a plate have touched other food on the plate, be cooked together, etc. (Though now for some reason I\u2019m the opposite and love most of my food mixing idk lol)\n\nBut here she never saw the meat touch the bone, she was enjoying the meat and had eaten plenty of it. Just knowing it was against the bone while raw they then couldn\u2019t eat it anymore. Maybe I\u2019m being judgmental but that just seems more unreasonable to me.", "Oh, so she's lazy and an asshole.  Enough said.  NTA", "You don\u2019t earn respect by calling someone a bitch and she didn\u2019t walk all over you, she declined your granny\u2019s food here. Your stepmom, dad, and granny need to have a serious chat and get some family counseling\u2014 yourself included. No one in the family is acting right.  If she regularly insults you,\u2026 she shouldn\u2019t. But you shouldn\u2019t be insulting her either. Your family, all of you, seriously need family counseling and to learn how to respect each other.", "And no bones involved in any of those, afaik.", "the thing is that disorders are not rational and dont make sense - it doesnt *matter* that the bones weren't seen  once they're mentioned and therefore thought about they cant be unthought about and even the person knowing its irrational doesnt stop it (and actually sometimes makes it worse? or feels like it does??). \n\nlike again not defending the stepmother re her rudeness/treatment of a child in her care, but the food thing (even bones being elsewhere) is a thing that actually makes loads of sense \n\nnot saying you're judgemental or anything at all - just explaining i guess?", "Okay first don\u2019t want her respect. Also she all ways leaves me out of family events. She treats me like trash threatened to put a fucking camera in my room. I have bells on my door because she wants to know when I come in and out. She be littles me mocks me I have to ask if I can eat.", "Also stop saying we are family she isn\u2019t my parent and I will never see her as one", "Yeah that is fair. I have a pretty bad panic disorder so I have mental and physical things that make me unable to even move or speak that I know aren\u2019t rational. So yeah while I don\u2019t really  understand it I can accept the bone thing.\n\nBut yeah the way she behaved was still cruel and unfair in this particular case at least. She\u2019s cruel to a child and an elderly woman for not cooking a separate meal for her when she is perfectly capable of making her own and was told she would need to do so.", "Ignore them. Fuck your step mum. If she doesn\u2019t want to be called a bitch, don\u2019t behave like a bitch !\n\nWhy is your dad still with her ?", "You have to ask if you can eat\u2014 but she doesn\u2019t mind you calling her bitch without any repercussions of that? I find your post incredibly hard to believe.", "You\u2019re family because she\u2019s married to your dad. You don\u2019t have to see her as a parent, but she is your step parent\u2026 like it or not. All of you need serious family counseling because none of you are acting mature in any way, granny excluded.", "She called me names and tried to ground me I got things taken away and shit.", "They are engaged not married still have to call her step mom", "Engaged\u2026 so soon to be wife, so stepmom is a fair name and about to be the legal status. Still family, even if you hate her\u2026 if/until they divorce. Like I said your entire family needs serious family counseling. You should have a respectful conversation about all of it to your dad\u2026but don\u2019t call him bitch.", "That woman is not OP\u2019s stepmom, that\u2019s just her dad\u2019s fianc\u00e9/wife and that\u2019s it. Stepmom is a title that\u2019s earned, not given just because you got married.\n\nedit: sorry, his not hers", "NTA- she better settle the fk down and learn to be respectful. Yorkshire pudding is AMAZING AND WITH SOUP? Bruh it\u2019s not all about her. Good on you and your dad for saying something", "NTA. She is an adult who can make her own food to her own preferences.", "NTA. Your stepmum is behaving like a 5 year old. Actually that\u2019s an insult to 5 years old, they\u2019re still learning, she\u2019s an adult who should know better.", "How do you eat meat AT ALL if your n 1 request is that it never touches the bone?\nHas she basic knowledge of anatomy?", "Make sure SM eats it all before revealing the recipe\u2026.only 1 have I ever told someone who wasn\u2019t Scottish how REAL haggis is made (since the shop bough stuff in the south of Scotland doesn\u2019t include the brains or stomach lining) and hasn\u2019t gagged or went green\u2026."]}
