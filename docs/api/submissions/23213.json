Maybe that is why Katie is fighting so much...even your post shows you blame Katie and Bella was just along for the ride. This is the way to eff with your kids mind.

Something we didn't allow for Bella.", "NTA\n\nHowever, I think you should have explained things to Kate in more concrete terms. If your teens have never had to pay for things before, then the value of money is still pretty abstract. They don't realize just how expensive things are. I think throwing in an \"okay, you officially don't have money for \\_\\_\\_ now,\" or \"looks like you're down to \\_\\_\\_ guests\" would have been more effective than simply telling her the dollar amount she lost. That said, Kate is old enough to have looked up the cost of things if she was so invested, so I don't think you're TA for not taking this extra step. \n\nThe more important question though is whether you've looked into what is causing your girls to fight? Have you looked into mental health resources? Fighting this much sounds like more than just teen rebellion.", "YTA\n\nI have long maintained that I hate birthdays being used to punish children.

Instead she continues to get punished. Not saying her actions shouldn't have consequences, they absolutely should so OP wasn't wrong in that regard, but Bella and Kate are not the same person. Bella was able to pull herself out of it relatively easily. Sounds more like she just had her sisters back.

But OP is TA for ignoring the huge red flags that her daughters, particularly Kate, need help! Either she is picking these fights which indicates underlying trauma or issues that cause anger, or she is being bullied and defending herself. Either way, punishing her won't change it in anyway until OP gets to the root of it all and gets some appropriate help for daughter(s)", "No, but there also needs to be an effort to understand the 'why' as well as changing the 'what'. \n\nWe often know what we should be doing, but when we have trouble doing that even when it's very clearly in our best interest there's usually something deeper going on. Even as adults, we generally can't effectively address an issue like that without understanding the drivers of the behaviour. \n\nIt's not really fair to think it would be different for a teenager just because rationally they should know better. It would be nice if rationally knowing what we should do was enough to just do it but sometimes there are other factors at play. \n\nIt sounds like there is something else going on, which means that either the incentive wasn't right for her or that there is a driver behind the behaviour that was stronger than the incentive. You can't know which one it is without curiosity and understanding the 'why'.", "How did you conclude that Kate never had consequences in her life?", "You know, instead of just saying shit why don't you get to the root cause of issues? Why are they getting into fights? Why are the grades bad? Why are they focusing on romance and having shitty friends? Do you all even care to make your children better or be petty with rules and other bullshit. Good grades, good behavior, and having a healthy social life don't deserve rewards. Also, are you dumb as rocks? Giving unequal treatment to milestones in life regardless of rationale will breed resentment and anger. I swear the ability to have empathy and perspective has not progressed past the age of five for you all, and the only dominating feeling is the need to dish out punitive punishments in the name of \"fairness and boundaries.\"\nYTA", "Nta", "NTA your were upfront the whole time. As Kate was losing money from her budget you told her. At any point she could have changed her act.", "For this moment? NTA. But holy did you raise those girls poorly. Even if at 16 teenagers tend to be more rebelious, the fact that not one, but both of them were picking fights left and right at school(that were dramatic enough to the point you were informed) shows an underlying issue in parenting.\n\nIf anything, it's good thar you finally did something to change things for the better.", "Personally, I think you would have had a very different outcome if you'd framed your system differently. You started them both off at X amount and deducted for every infraction. It's a very negative parenting style, there's no way for the child to feel good in that system, and when someone already feels like they're losing they have far less incentive to win. If you had said to both your party budget is zero, and you now have so many months to top up the pot, I think you would have seen different results. Each good grade, each week of not fighting could be immediately rewarded with X amount of dollars. An instant mental connection for a teenager of 'doing a good thing equals getting closer to my goal'. It builds up momentum and positive feeling, and a desire to keep doing better. Crucially, it also opens a feeling of trust and warmth towards you which allows you to then support and guide them while they try and make the changes. You can scoff and say' they're nearly adults' but really that's just you trying to get wriggle out of your responsibilities. You still have to parent them at 16.

Apparently you don\u2019t know how to parent your children and actions have consequences. You can either take down the post or I\u2019m going to report you you\u2019re teaching your children actions have consequences if you\u2019re going to bully and fight. This is what happens.", "YTA- I don't think you've accomplished anything here that's really gonna make the next school year better.  You have one kid who only made an effort to do better because there was an incentive to have a spectacular birthday party, but what's gonna happen now that her birthday has passed?  Is she gonna go back to not caring unless you threaten her next birthday, or Christmas, or something else she'll care about?  That's not teaching her anything except 'only care about being a decent person when there's a reward attached to it.'\n\nYour other kid didn't care at all, and she found out you weren't bullshitting the deal.  But again, now that her birthday has passed, will that actually change anything?  And if Kate was still getting into fights and getting into trouble despite the incentive, then there's got to be bigger issues going on that can't be fixed with a party.  I think you should've looked into getting them into some kind of counseling instead of doing all this.", "NTA but you need to reply to let the parent know Bella earned the money for her party - you didn\u2019t just give it to her - because she did - and acknowledge the time and effort she spent time planning to make it happen, while the other sister made different choices. Point out that chalking it up to favoritism is an insult to Bella\u2019s hard work, and note that she started working on and planning her party an entire year ago. Emphasize that effort made a difference - but not your effort! \n\nGood on Bella for making better choices!", "Adverse to what everything else thinks, YTA  \n\n\nWhen you're at that age, any punishments/consequences need to have an immediate effect. Having one several months down the line, does not work as a deterrent.  \n\n\nIt also seems like instead of looking for what was actually causing the problem, you jumped straight to punishment. There's no mention in this of what was actually causing them to act out, let alone any other attempts to stop it besides just threatening them.", "Is a \"priviledge\" something that is at the top of an ivory tower?", ">Not everyone has such an easy time with academics, and sometimes fights are hard to avoid. Did she start the fights? Why? Was she being harassed or bullied? I\u2019m gonna go against the grain with this one and say YTA\n\nOf course. Whenever the subreddit mascots are an AH (basically a wife, gf, daughter, tenant service staff), the invented scenarios with excuses for the AH behaviour come rolling out like clockwork.\n\nThis doesn't even seem like its about grades but more about not getting suspended and into fights, which is expected.", "Did you not read the post?", "What do you expect from Kate here? She's is nearly sixteen and more than old enough to know actions have consequences. Babying her and giving in would mean she'll never change. Now she knows her parents follow through with what they say.", "Teenagers can be irrational but even they can understand basic maths. This is squarely on Kate.", "yeah, i did. never got suspended, or cheated or fought at school. I drunk occasionally and only ever with a trusted adult and permission\u2026. so yeah a lot of people had their acts together at 16", "stop trying to excuse shitty behavior. a 16 year old knows better.", "I wouldn\u2019t bother unless Kate actually expresses interest in another explanation. \n\nRight now, OP has no reason to believe that Kate doesn\u2019t understand *why* she had a smaller party. Just that she\u2019s upset about the fact that OP actually followed through on that threat.", "Yeah you def 100% had your act together so much so that you broke the law and thought it was okay because an adult said so. Also why is an adult drinking with a minor. Excuse me though you had your act together", "it\u2019s actually not illegal in australia (where i live) to drink underage. it is illegal to purchase and consume alcohol under the age of 18 on a public or licensed venue. however, drinking on private property with parental permission is completely ok. just fyi."]}
