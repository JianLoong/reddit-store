Do it quietly and don't give enough warning for the exodus to get sabotaged. Also know that any problem she tries to make about you has absolutely nothing to do with you. If she really has these tendencies, 100% of any nasty comments or criticism is a coping mechanism to deal with some internal upset that has nothing to do with you in reality. Instead of dealing with the problem feelings inside, she just makes you a target to pretend that the problem is someone else. \n\nNot a doctor, certainly not medical advice.

My daughter comes home with a spiderweb tattooed on her face?\n\nLet's not pretend like facial piercings are anywhere near comparable to a face tattoo. They're two totally different leagues. Facial piercings are widely more acceptable in more industries than facial tattoos are. There's a reason why most artists won't tattoo people's faces/necks/hands unless they're heavily tattooed. I am tattooed and pierced, I'd be totally fine with my kid coming home with a facial piercing but not a face tattoo. \n\nPlus, who knows what these facial piercings are. They could be something as common as nostril piercings, or easily hidden like a septum. \n\nBut OP is an unreliable narrator because mum also has piercings so mum can't not approve of piercings? Like the mum can't just be a hypocrite? And by OP not specifically saying what other comments her mum has made about her boobs, she's somehow trying to paint her mum out as worse than she really is? That's a weird conclusion to come to. \n\nAre we just going to ignore the whole \"I'm your mother\" comment when asked to stop looking at her boobs? Or the fact nipple piercings aren't facial ones yet mum is still mad (mad enough to say only whores have nipple piercings, aka, calling your own daughter a whore)?", "Nah, the whole \"I am your mother\" thing as a response to being asked not to comment on your daughter's body 100% checks out. Sounds like OP's mom is the kind of person who sees her daughter as a physical extension of herself and doesn't respect her as her own person.

That\u2019s why people will pierce babies\u2019 ears, but no tattoo artist is tattooing a baby no matter how much the mother pleas and begs them to.

I have proof - I came home with a face tattoo and they made it clear they hated it,\" I'm 100% certain that would be misrepresenting you, and I'd catch that immediately. Once that kid tried to get me to believe false stuff like that, I'm not going to trust the rest of what they assess, unless I get independent verification. Either they aren't astute enough to know that there's a difference there - and like it or not, there is, even though facial piercings are WAY more acceptable now - or they are intentionally misleading me about you.

A lot of people/businesses don't like facial tattoos or piercings, and parents do get concerned about their kids pigeon-holing themselves before they've had some experience.  While Post Malone has a great gig as a musician because he's good at it, and he's in a field where face tattoos are okay,, he'd have a hard time making it as, say, a real estate agent or something where a company wants him to \"interface with the customers.\" Facial piercings are much more normalized now, and most can be removed, but it's hard to remove some, and mom might be a bit concerned about that. Or maybe she just doesn't like facial piercings. Doesn't mean she sees her daughter as an extension of her. \n\nAnd while OPs initial misrepresentation doesn't guarantee the rest of what she says is a lie or slanted all to hell, she has already proven that either (1) she's not astute enough to realize there's a difference between piercings and tattoos on the face and piercings and tattoos elsewhere, and disliking face ones doesn't at all mean someone dislikes them writ large, or (2) she IS astute enough to tell the difference and deliberately tried to mislead the readers. Either option is bad.  Either dumb or deliberate, her assessments can longer be trusted since she started off stating\"wrong\" as a fact.  Had she just stuck with \"Mom hates my multiple facial piercings\" rather than \"mom's a hypocrite because she hates piercings even though she has them,\" I'd believe her about the rest, because she hasn't given me a reason not to. The fact that she started off by clearly misrepresenting her mother causes me to not trust anything she has to say about her mom without independent verification, which isn't going to happen on Reddit. \n\nOnce someone proves themselves to you as a liar, you shouldn't trust anything they have to say without independent verification, until they have proven over time to not do that anymore.

(See description for grey rock below) But key to this is you MUST stay calm. If you yell/cuss/call her names back it wont work. Remember the calm person wins. \n\nWhat you want is for  her to come to you with her concerns in a calm nice way. For her to say \"I'm worried about how you look to men\" instead of calling you a whore. WHEN she is nice, make a sincere effort to indulge her and listen until she stops talking. (It might be a pain in the ass but just do it). Afterwards tell her: \" I've listened & heard you out. I will think about what you said OR I'm sorry that we dont share the same views.  We dont agree but thats ok.We can still accept and love eachother.) Thank you for caring about me\" \n\nAfter that if she gets mad/tries to lecture you about  it again say NICELY CAMLY in 2 sentances \" we've already discussed this. I'm done talking about it\" and be silent again. \n\nThe silent trestment/grey rocking will eventually wear her out and she will stop. And if you have to set another boundary, it will go faster next time because she already knows you wont give in. \n\nB) You are 18 and your mom still thinks of you as her child, whereas you are at a point where you need support as an adult, not a child. When you are in your late teens early/twenties this is a really common problem. Unfirtunately alot of parents dont really start acting like you are an adult, until you move out of the house. Try to find some roomates/save for an apartnent or do a long term airbnb where the host is a superhost and a female.\n\nGrey Rocking https://www.betterup.com/blog/grey-rocking", "Wtf is wrong with everyone saying YTA.

Nipple piercings are sexualized culturally and have been demonized morally for years so there is a lot of shaming and a lack of empathy for anyone who gets harassed for them (newsflash for everyone else who reads this: nipple piercings aren\u2019t inherently sexual and even if they were gotten with sexual intentions in mind it is still not any of your business to comment on them EVEN IF YOU SEE THEM you think it\u2019s socially acceptable to point out when everyone\u2019s nipples are cold too?

Abuse can always be validated and excused by an abusive individual. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s actually excusable or worth validation. \n\nRegardless of the circumstances the act of looking for your piercings is invasive and sexual harassment (her being your mother does not give her special circumstances or boundaries even if she believes that) and the passive aggressive way of calling you a whore \u201cbecause you acted like one\u201d is insanely abusive and completely in line with narcissistic parental abuse.
