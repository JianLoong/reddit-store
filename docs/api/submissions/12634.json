Do it quietly and don't give enough warning for the exodus to get sabotaged. Also know that any problem she tries to make about you has absolutely nothing to do with you. If she really has these tendencies, 100% of any nasty comments or criticism is a coping mechanism to deal with some internal upset that has nothing to do with you in reality. Instead of dealing with the problem feelings inside, she just makes you a target to pretend that the problem is someone else. \n\nNot a doctor, certainly not medical advice.

For me it's the context that makes it shitty.", ">Its two tiny bumps on your chest. It aint that noticeable, and they dont make your nipples permanently hard\n\nWell yea this is all down to the individual, a lot of girls nipples do in fact stay hard or mostly hard for as long as the piercings are there. Also everyone is wearing different piercings and some are smaller than others obviously.\n\nMy only point was that it's not always the case that you'd have to be staring and perving too notice either.", "I acknowledge that and even agreed with it in a seperate comment. Obviously this case is different for literally every girl on the planet. My only point was that you don't HAVE to be staring to notice piercings EVERY time.\n\nI'm not a boob guy at all I've never been interested in boobs it's literally just mounds of fat I get zero stimulation from seeing boobs, yet I've noticed tons of nipple piercings. I guarantee you that they're not from staring(in my case) . Only time I stare at a chest is when it's bare and hanging over my face \ud83d\ude02", "I don't know know why I\u2019m getting downvoted. I\u2019m simply stating the mother might have raised her daughter to dress more modestly and pointing her nipple rings out was a way of correction. I never said I did or didn't agree with that.

That makes zero sense. \n\nI also don't care about your opinion because you have made repeat misogynistic claims all over this thread. \n\nStop staring at your kid's tits. Women don't need to wear bras. Gross.", "18 year old daughter vs middle aged mother\n\nDaughter dislikes being made uncomfortable in her own skin, so she just makes it up to cry to the internet for likes? \n\nIs that really how you see children? \n\nWho *wouldnt* get mad at being put into a perverse light? Please think really hard about *why* you feel the need to hide breasts at all.

You can't tell that OP is an unreliable narrator and lied to you already about Mom's perspective?

Which, idk. Everyone is different but that alone feels incredibly weird to me", "So there\u2019s only one type of nipple piercing? And I just have to ask this. Since you\u2019re an expert pls tell us comparing your wife breast size and OPs who\u2019s are more noticeable? \n\n\n\n\nCLEARLY YOU HAVEN\u2019T SEEN OP BEFORE SO HOW THE HELL ARE YOU GOING TO COMPARE ALL THE TITTIES IN THE WORLD WITH NIPPLE PIERCINGS TO YOUR WIFES?", "You're delusional.", "No, it isn't how I see children. At all. It's how I see THIS child.

Same goes with piercings. \n\nMy parents don't like tattoos. I wanted a tattoo. So i waited until I was no longer under their roof to get a tattoo.
