But again, don\u2019t be shocked to find out many of our families would notice these things and comfortably raise it with us without us caring even in the slightest.\n\nEdit: oh, and not just my family - but many others like mine - the mothers will consider every part of their daughters body as something worth discussing as they care about their daughters mental and physical health. Nothings really \u2018out of bounds\u2019 until it\u2019s expressly stated that we don\u2019t want to discuss these things.", "Quit being hard-headed and listen to good advice.", "Not to mention her mom literally called her a whore because of her Piercings, I'm so disgusted and confused by everyone being so mean to OP, so much misogyny too in these comments, I don't like nipple Piercings, but I'm not going to shame anyone who gets them, I'm not going to call them horrible names and tell them to \"cover up\" because someone who's supposed to love them are saying horrible things about them and being creepy, while they rightfully complain about it OP is NTA", "You got a judgment you didn\u2019t like but stop adding additional information to make yourself seem like a victim. I agree with top comment calling you out for making it seem like she sexually assaulted yoh", "You really need to learn how to spell. Every one of your comments is ridiculous. YTA.", "Not really any different than when my aunt or mom told me my fly was down imo", "Well if you don't want her to notice them, put more clothes on. Pierced nipples ate pretty bloody obvious", "Your not the asswhole your mom shouldn't be looking at your fucking tits period idaf what these creeps say there creeps just like yr mom people shouldn't be looking at your tits unless you want them to especially your fucking mom and these old pervs on here trying to justify your mom looking at your tifs", "Then cover up.", "I don\u2019t know why you keep getting downvoted with your responses. I have a very, hate to say it but it\u2019s true, disrespectful mother who\u2019s always been mean and critical among other things. I understand that at times it\u2019s hard to not throw back the attitude that\u2019s given to you when you\u2019re dealing with someone like that on a regular basis. You\u2019re of legal age to have the piercing and it\u2019s on your body , not hers. If she has a problem with it then she can simply redirect her attention to your face while talking to you as it should have been in the first place. I never have and never Will understand why people find it necessary to critique something that has absolutely nothing to do with them.", "Let your friends know this, it might push one or two to rush a bit to help you out.  I mean, ask if there's anyway y'all can do it any sooner, given the circumstances it can't hurt\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I don't think...", "Yeah it absolutely does. I definitely don't think it was appropriate (especially after reading some other comments XD) its altogether very rude, hope she will stop", "you've ignored about 20 YTA/ESH judgements telling you it's not sexual harassment to notice a nipple piercing when someone isn't wearing a bra just to respond to this one person who is making it into as big a deal as you are...", "No one agrees with this take except you who is trying to be a victim", "Oh *HELL NO* to this!\n\nIt's not for \"drawing more attention.\" That's absurd. This person already dresses in oversized clothes and doesn't draw attention. \n\nShe adorned her insecurity area and took control of how she gets to see it, decorate it, or appreciate it. \n\nThe idea that nipple piercings are for drawing attention is ABSOLUTELY out of pocket.", "How could it draw more attention? She\u2019s not topless. It\u2019s about doing something for yourself, not so other people can see it. NTA", "You're right! She should wear a burka so no one talks about her boobs.", "Hey hey hey why are you trying to use logic here.  Obviously the piercings make her feel better about herself and not wearing a bra around\u2026\u2026..I mean why are we to argue that she is now gaslighting people on the piercings.  Of course this all makes perfect sense because we are through the looking glass/s", "Wrong or right The mother seems more modest, her way of telling her she could see her nipple rings may have been her way of teaching her to be more modest.", "Do they also frequently talk about your dick like op's mom does?", "bro is equating dick to boob?", "Bruh, people notice things. We have eyes. Even in 100% platonic and respectful relationships people are going to notice if you have your nipples pierced and wear a thin pajama top. \n\nNoticing things is human. \n\nUsually people keep it to themselves, unless it's a situation that might warrant pointing it out. (Like, \"hey Jim, your fly's down,\" or, \"Janet you've tucked your skirt into your tights.\")\n\nIt's not sexual and it's weird that you're making it that way.", "i was clothed, re-read the post.", "I had nipple piercings, you can see them through the right fabric without a bra.  Just saying, they can be hard to hide.  It\u2019s no one\u2019s business what she pierces but it\u2019s a weird, over-the-top reaction to the whole situation.", "Or don\u2019t be surprised when you get a piercing that\u2019s visible and people notice.  \ud83d\ude44", "and what is modesty based around again?", "If he has non-dick things sticking out the tip and walks around in a speedo? Yeah, people might talk about his dick. In boxers where it shows but less? Yes.", "Internet is weird bro\n\nHalf the time people saying don\u2019t sexualize boobs\u2026 next minute noticing the boob piercings is sexual harassment or some shit idk", "Her mom called her a whore.", "Your a fucking creep for looking at people's tits I never look at my sister's or mom's tits I look at there face (my sister has her nipples pierced and I didn't notice until she told me bc I'm not a fucking creep stop trying to excuse your rapeyness", "*\"obviously i wasn't wearing a bra\"*\n\nCLEARLY you weren't wearing enough because she saw your piercings. You can be as mad as you want at your mother while you live free under her roof, but own your shit.", "Yikes @ you", "Yeah, if someone notices anything about your private bits, they should comment on it! That's not weird at all or inappropriate.", "Traditional", "Op says mom commented on her breasts repeatedly before the piercing *and* the material was thick enough you'd have to be really looking to notice. \n\nSo, no. It wouldn't be like that.", "People keep ignoring this part and it\u2019s making me enraged", "I didn't say that was right. I only said noticing nipple piercings doesn't make one a creep.", "\ud83e\udd23 what are you, 13? You ARE a creep if you think an accidental glance is always sexual. Until you get over your mental equation of \"tits are always sexual\" then YOU are the one being creepy and weird. \n\nBodies are natural. We all have them. And noticing them is NBD.", "Cool. Enjoy being the minority. In healthy relationships with your family, it\u2019s not a weird/gross thing. Again, people notice shit and your family is supposed to be the kinda people that CAN talk to you about these things.\n\nAnd Jesus Christ.. it\u2019s your mom/sis relationship.. they can\u2019t look at your boobs? My sis and her friends - actually, all my girlfriends constantly look at each others boobs and talk about each others books. Lol \u2018rapeyness\u2019 is the biggest bloody stretch I\u2019ve ever heard in my life - actually made me chuckle.\n\nI think you\u2019d be surprised by a lot of other women agreeing on that as well.. I\u2019ve never been around women who didn\u2019t care about looking / discussing each others boobs.\n\nAnd finally, it\u2019s a nipple piercing. Something that the mother clearly finds abhorring (different times, right)? It\u2019s like seeing anything that grosses you out or irritates you. For some reason your eyes are just drawn to it even more. Humans are fucking weird like that.", "Did you read anything??\n\nHer mom called her a WHORE. What do you think WHORE means???", "Friend, please notice that the comment I was replying to never brought that issue up. They only said\n\n>Your not the asswhole your mom shouldn't be looking at your fucking tits period idaf what these creeps say there creeps just like yr mom people shouldn't be looking at your tits unless you want them to especially your fucking mom and these old pervs on here trying to justify your mom looking at your tifs\n\nNothing about the name calling. \n\nYou're mad about something I never defended, and will never defend.", "My mistake. Still given OPs moms history, it's hard to say that an accidental glance from her wouldnt mean a sexualised undertone. It seems that OPs mom instilled her own internalized misogyny/sexism into her own daughter hence OPs struggle to be comfy in her own skin. Mom appears to hold the tits are sexual view and OP has probably had to defend herself from it since she grew breasts."]}
