{"id": 14203, "submission_id": "12eglgb", "title": "AITA for leaving when my BIL wouldn\u2019t let me in the hot tub?", "selftext": "My BIL just bought a new house. He lives about 4 hours from us. Last weekend my husband and I went to visit him for a few days and see the house for the first time. \n\nLong story short, I got my period while I was sleeping and the guest room sheets had a small bloodstain (about the size of a quarter). My husband helped me strip the bed and I went down to the laundry room to pretreat and then wash the sheets. When they were done, the bloodstain was 100% gone but when we told BIL he looked completely disgusted. He inspected the sheets super closely for a very long time and finally I was like \u201cJesus, BIL, if you\u2019re looking that closely and can\u2019t find a stain, can\u2019t you trust me that I got it out?\u201d He seemed really put out by the whole thing. \n\nThat night, we had plans to hang out in BIL\u2019s hot tub in the backyard, but after dinner, he told me that I wasn\u2019t allowed in the hot tub because of my period. \n\nI was shocked and explained that the nighttime leak was because I hadn\u2019t been expecting my period and had been fast asleep all night, but that it was perfectly safe and sanitary for me to put in a tampon and sit in the hot tub for an hour. But he wouldn\u2019t budge. \n\nMy husband had my back and told him that he was being ridiculous, and it ended up turning into a big argument. Eventually my husband and I decided to pack our stuff and stay at a nearby hotel, and then we drove home the next morning. \n\nNow BIL is pissed at us for leaving and for not respecting his home. He also Venmo requested my husband $100 for new sheets, which he is refusing to pay (but trust that if the stain hadn\u2019t come out, we would\u2019ve been happy to replace them). He told his whole side of the family, who\u2019ve decided to fully stay out of it (I wish they had our backs more but at least they\u2019re not piling onto us). \n\nSo are husband and I AH for leaving and not paying for the sheets?\n\nEDIT: I swore I\u2019d never be one of those people who did this but to all the people who say ESH or YTA because of a certain risk (that I won\u2019t mention here bc this isn\u2019t a medical sub) I\u2019ll just say that if BIL was worried about that risk for me, it would be a different story. He didn\u2019t want me in the hot tub because \u201cperiod blood is gross.\u201d\n\nEDIT #2: for everyone asking why I even told him, it\u2019s because my period isn\u2019t a dirty little secret, it\u2019s a natural thing that happens to half of the adult population. And because I\u2019m not going to sneak around like a cat burglar to do laundry. He heard the dryer buzz and asked about it and I told him.\n\nEDIT #3: some more FAQs:\nBIL has a GF who doesn\u2019t live with him. She hung out with us the first night (that was the first time I\u2019d met her) but had to work the night of the argument so she wasn\u2019t around. IDK what she thinks of the whole situation and I\u2019m not going to reach out about it.  And BIL isn\u2019t on the spectrum, he doesn\u2019t have OCD, and he\u2019s not a germophobe. He just thinks it\u2019s gross.\n\nEDIT #4: wow, this really blew up! Anyway, **please trust that I know my body** and my flow and that on the first full day of my period I know that I can wear a tampon for a while without leaking. FWIW we did go to the hotel\nhot tub after we checked on and I stayed in for 90 minutes and when I got out there was nary a speck of evil dirty vagina blood on my bathing suit.", "created_utc": 1680863272, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12eglgb/aita_for_leaving_when_my_bil_wouldnt_let_me_in/", "score": 18298, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When inserted into the vagina, the vaginal muscles hold it in place. When exposed to moisture (such as blood), the tampon expands in width, which further improves the seal and prevents leakage. There was a running joke in a 2000s movie called She's the Man in which tampons were used for bloody noses, and honestly? I think that would work fine. Same concept. As others have said, it's like an absorbent plug. It is perfectly sanitary and very common to swim while using a tampon.\n\nThere is a string on the bottom which is supposed to hang out, so you can just grab it and pull it out when you want to replace it. (Some people cut this string off if they're wearing bikinis or are otherwise scantily clad.) You do have to flex your kegel muscles a certain way for it to come out, so it doesn't generally slip out on its own.\n\nThey come in a few different sizes. The size you use depends on your own anatomy and how heavily you bleed when menstruating. The texture of the dry tampon by itself is pretty uncomfortable on the delicate tissue of the vagina, so most tampons come with \"applicators\" -- plastic tubes you can push the tampon through during insertion so it doesn't rub uncomfortably, then remove and discard the tube and leave the tampon inside. It is usually very uncomfortable or even painful to insert or remove a tampon while not on your period, since there's not usually enough moisture to lubricate it. The process is not at all sexually pleasurable in nature, but it's not meant to hurt. If it hurts a significant amount, something is wrong.\n\nYou shouldn't leave a tampon in for more than 4 hours, or you risk getting an infection, or in a few rare cases, even Toxic Shock Syndrome. TSS has, in a few well publicized cases, led to amputation of the leg(s). So you have to use a pad instead to sleep. Yes, it's possible to accidentally get a tampon stuck up inside you if the string gets tangled up or something. You might use a mirror, an understanding friend, and/or a pair of tweezers to help get it out. If it's really stuck, go to Urgent Care. They've seen it before and won't judge.\n\nGodspeed to everyone learning about tampons for the first time today, whether for themselves or for others in their life.", "there are men that think a woman\u2019s eggs have hard shells, so, yeah.", "Dude I stopped shaving my legs during COVID, and it still blows my mind how many disgusted looks I get when going out in public standing right next to my fianc\u00e9\u2019s much hairier legs.
