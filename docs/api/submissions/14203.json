Last weekend my husband and I went to visit him for a few days and see the house for the first time. \n\nLong story short, I got my period while I was sleeping and the guest room sheets had a small bloodstain (about the size of a quarter). My husband helped me strip the bed and I went down to the laundry room to pretreat and then wash the sheets. When they were done, the bloodstain was 100% gone but when we told BIL he looked completely disgusted. He inspected the sheets super closely for a very long time and finally I was like \u201cJesus, BIL, if you\u2019re looking that closely and can\u2019t find a stain, can\u2019t you trust me that I got it out?\u201d He seemed really put out by the whole thing. \n\nThat night, we had plans to hang out in BIL\u2019s hot tub in the backyard, but after dinner, he told me that I wasn\u2019t allowed in the hot tub because of my period. \n\nI was shocked and explained that the nighttime leak was because I hadn\u2019t been expecting my period and had been fast asleep all night, but that it was perfectly safe and sanitary for me to put in a tampon and sit in the hot tub for an hour. But he wouldn\u2019t budge. \n\nMy husband had my back and told him that he was being ridiculous, and it ended up turning into a big argument. Eventually my husband and I decided to pack our stuff and stay at a nearby hotel, and then we drove home the next morning. \n\nNow BIL is pissed at us for leaving and for not respecting his home. He also Venmo requested my husband $100 for new sheets, which he is refusing to pay (but trust that if the stain hadn\u2019t come out, we would\u2019ve been happy to replace them). He told his whole side of the family, who\u2019ve decided to fully stay out of it (I wish they had our backs more but at least they\u2019re not piling onto us). \n\nSo are husband and I AH for leaving and not paying for the sheets?\n\nEDIT: I swore I\u2019d never be one of those people who did this but to all the people who say ESH or YTA because of a certain risk (that I won\u2019t mention here bc this isn\u2019t a medical sub) I\u2019ll just say that if BIL was worried about that risk for me, it would be a different story.

Also, the warm water can increase dizziness associated with a heavier menstrual flow.\n\nBut along with accidental injuries, there are some other scary-sounding health risks. Because the water is much hotter than in pools, chlorine and other disinfectants break down much faster, which can increase your risk for infection. Here's what to be aware of:\n\n1. Hot Tub Rash\n\nAlso known as Pseudomonas dermatitis or Pseudomonas folliculititis, Hot Tub Rash is an infection caused from the germ Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which results in an itchy, bumpy red rash and pus-filled blisters. The rash generally pops up after a few days and will go away on its own (if not, see the doctor!). The best way to avoid it: Skip soaking for long periods in a tub that you don't clean or maintain yourself. Or, if you do, shower immediately afterwards and clean your swimsuit.\n\n2. Legionnaires' Disease\n\nLegionella is a germ that causes a severe type of pneumonia, which you can contract from inhaling bacteria from the steam of a contaminated hot tub. Symptoms, such as headache, muscle pain, chills, and fever, usually develop a day or so after a dip. According to the Mayo Clinic, by the second or third day, you might get a cough accompanied with mucus or blood, shortness of breath, chest pain, and confusion. Those who are aged 50 and over, smoke, and have chronic lung conditions are most susceptible to Legionnaires.\n\n3. Irritation from bodily fluids\n\nSorry, but this one is going to gross you out. Charles Gerba, Ph.D., a professor of microbiology and environmental studies at The University of Arizona, spoke with The Huffington Post about fecal matter bacteria contamination in hot tubs. \"The average bather has about a tenth of a gram of feces in his gluteal fold, which is a nice way of saying butt crack. \\[With five people soaking,\\] you have a tablespoon of poop in the hot tub,\" he says.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\r  \nYes, hot tubs are chlorinated, but if\r  \nthey aren't properly maintained, the\r  \nchemicals won't kill off all the teeming bacteria that love to call them\r  \nhome. The heat doesn't fry them\r  \neither, says hot-tub expert Brenda\r  \nMurr, member of the American\r  \nPool and Spa Professionals retail\r  \ncouncil. \"Bacteria grow even faster\r  \nin warm water,\" she says.\r  \nThe most common side effect of\r  \nsoaking is pseudomonas folliculitis,\r  \na skin infection that produces itchy,\r  \nbright red bumps. It usually clears\r  \nup on its own in 10 days or less\u2014a\r  \ngood thing considering that it's resistant to many antibiotics, according to Albert Lefkovits, a dermatologist in New York City.\r  \n\r  \nThen there are the bacteria that\r  \ncause toxic shock syndrome (the\r  \nlife-threatening infection tampon\r  \nboxes warn about). They can get in\r  \na tub if another person who has\r  \nsoaked before you carries them and\r  \nenter your body through a small cut\r  \nor scrape. Getting toxic shock syndrome from a tub is rare, says Dr.\r  \nPhillips, but it does happen.", "It's the bacteria rather than heat that causes TSS and many hot tubs harbor bacteria that causes infection on the regular.", "Nope, likely not.

Cannot recommend highly enough", "TERFs make me angry \ud83d\ude20 there are also many reasons for not having periods so that is hardly a qualifier for being a real woman!", "Terfs can suck it, you're a valid woman through and through. There are plenty of cis women who don't get periods so don't even worry about it. Terfs are the worst. I'm sorry you have to deal with them.", "There isn't special bacteria in period blood though. It's just the healthy bacteria that is typically in women's vaginas and cervixes, which would be there if the woman was not menstruating too... TSS comes from bacteria that enters the vagina and is not usually in the vagina (like staph from your hands).

You probably spit and snot more into the tub than any woman with a tampon bleeds into it. \n\nSecondly: unless the woman is gravely ill, her blood does not contain ANY of the bacteria you listed above. \nBlood is one of the cleanest bodily fluids, especially in comparison with snot, spit, sweat, and anything YOU (and everybody else) have on your skin every day. \n\nIf you argue that a hot tub is not a good option for sb on their period, then the reason is, that they are at risk because of everything that already is IN the water. Not that she introduces stuff. \nBasic biology.

You just need to change your tampon when you get out and be careful to wash your hands very thoroughly before putting the next one in. It's not nearly enough concern to not use a hot tub (not any more than using a hot tub is typically a concern because of their bacteria counts).", "Oh wow I\u2019ve literally never used sheets other than budget ones.
