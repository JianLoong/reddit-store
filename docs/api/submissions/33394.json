You don't owe her equal opportunity with her cousin.\n\nIf it was me? I probably would try and find her a job. But I'd make it a \"real\" job.

Maybe you should have been paying her the going rate to begin with. \n\nThat being said, do you live in a place with a yard? You could get her to do yardwork if so. That needs to be done and if you have the money to pay her for like, weeding, then maybe that\u2019s a job you could offer her. \n\nI do feel bad for her losing both her parents. That would be really rough.", "I think Sally probably knows things don\u2019t always go her way.  Her parents are dead.  \nThat doesn\u2019t obligate you.  I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re an AH but you kinda sound like one the way you talk about your niece.  \nYou asked her what was wrong and she told you she\u2019d like to EARN some money too.  If you don\u2019t want to, don\u2019t.  But you asked and she answered.  \nDon\u2019t ask questions you don\u2019t want the answer to.", "Sally\u2019s parents both died.

I\u2019m not saying you have to give her a job (though I think it would be a kindness to your family if you found something Sally could do to earn money, because it really does otherwise appear you\u2019re favoring Emma), but you need to be kind to her, or else you should stay away from both girls until you can be.", "INFO - are you paying Emma market rate? Or are you overpaying her because she's your niece?  \nIf you are giving Emma a cushy job as a favor to a family member (which is a totally natural thing to do), I understand why Sally is unhappy, and you are being insensitive. You don't owe her a job or anything else, but it's not shocking that a child hopes for fairness from her family.", "Soft YTA. You say you give \"rather generous pay\" for the dogsitting. So it sounds like this is your way of giving money to Emma, but not Sally.\n\nExample: say a pet sitting service (like Rover? I'm not a pet owner, but I'm aware these things exist) would charge $50 a day, but you are paying $100. That is extra money that you are gifting Emma because she is your niece. But you are not gifting Sally anything.  Hence, the imbalance.\n\nI would always pay my sons \"generously\" because it was a way to slide them some extra money but tie it to work/reward when they were kids, and later,  when they were older,  so it didn't feel like a handout to them. Your comment about generous pay sounds to me like you're doing the same thing. \n\nSo the suggestion that you find something for Sally to do is not really off the wall. Yardwork/gardening if she can't be in the house with the dogs? And of course, pay generously.\n\nOr just pay Emma the normal rate for her services.", "NTA, but perhaps if you hear of any work that pays better than average over the holidays you could let her know about it.", "NTA but I don't think Sally runs the risk of being \"coddled\". Her parents are dead, she knows life isn't fair. I don't think it's your responsibility to find Sally a job, but it sure would be a good deed if found something she could help out with, like garden work or such. She wants to earn her money, which is commendable, and has been dealt a shit hand with her allergies. She not asking for hand-outs just a chance to get some money like her cousin. If I were you I would do something for Sally so she doesn't feel completely left out.", "YTA for even offering her the job because of her allergies. Sally never even had a chance to watch the dogs. I don\u2019t blame you for not creating work for Sally, but of course she\u2019s going to be jealous her cousin is getting \u2018generous pay\u2019 for a cushy job that she simply can\u2019t even attempt to do. The generous pay part sounds like you\u2019re paying Emma extra just for being your niece. \n\nAlso, you\u2019re the AH for suggesting an orphan doesn\u2019t already know very well life isn\u2019t fair.", "NTA\n\nYou have one job that MUST be done by someone and Emma can do it. You don't owe Sally anything, especially a made-up job. That's just the way life is. 16 is old enough to learn it.\n\n If Emma happened to qualify for a sports team at school and Sally didn't, would Sally feel she was owed something to be equal?", "What does Sally mean \"get her a job\"? If Sally is truly allergic to dogs, there's really not much of anything you can hire her to do, as being in your home where the dogs live isn't an option.  \n\nBest you can do is offer to recommend Sally if you hear of a friend needing help that Sally's qualified to do.", "Technically YTA - have some empathy.

Big time. It's not your responsibility to find her a job, but she's a young teen who lost both her parents, and obviously she understands she can't have everything her way, based on the hand life has dealt her. It would do you some good to be less judgmental and be more sympathetic to Sally's situation, because in her mind, she is probably overthinking this situation, and imagining that so many things in her life are against her. \n\nYou don't need to coddle her, but be kind to her. Life is not easy, but you don't need to be rude when showing someone that. You're in the right in terms of actions, but not with the way you handled it with her.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s like needing a lifeguard for your pool and then offering the job to the person who can swim. A person who can\u2019t swim then they told you it isn\u2019t fair. No. It\u2019s not on you. They just need to find something they can do within their limit. That\u2019s how the world works. Sally is 16. This is something she needs to accept and understand.", "Nta, not everyone is qualified for every job. Whether it be talent or an allergy. One girl has the ability to do the job you need. The other one doesn't. You are not required to hire everybody just because you hired one. Like you said the world's not fair, and you are doing nothing wrong. She's just jealous because the sister that works for you is probably has an easier job. More fun job and gets better pay because you're helping out a niece.

People with allergies get discriminated against commonly, yes. But you shouldn\u2019t be instilling that it\u2019s what she should expect in general. \n\nThe job can\u2019t be done, fine.

Surely there\u2019s parts of the job that can be done by Sally that are not dependent on interaction. Getting supplies from the shops for the dog or anything, for instance? There are many parts here that can apply to both without causing a medical incident.", "NTA. I probably go overboard trying to make things fair for people, but this one is beyond even me. You don\u2019t owe Sally. You need a job done and you are paying Emma to do it. Unfortunately, Sally can\u2019t do the job. However, Sally can look for other work if she needs money.

She already knows life is unfair and won't always go her way, she lost both her parents. You didn't need to rub it in her face that one more thing in life didn't go her way, i.e. her allergies. You don't have to coddle her but Sally is going to take it as favoritism towards Emma that only she gets a job from their Aunt and that's going to create a rift between them. It's a tough position to be in but maybe you could sit both girls down and tell them you made a mistake you couldn't have foreseen the consequences of and didn't mean to come between them or hurt either of their feelings, but it'd probably be best to have Emma stop dog sitting since you don't have a different job to offer Sally.", "Omg girl dangling participle much.

While Emma is benefitting from an easy job for lots of pay now, Sally is getting real life skills. She's dealing with customers, learning to meet different needs, and making connections with people that might be willing to be a reference for her later. An aunt is not a great reference in comparison. Watching dogs during vacation is not college application material to write about.

And as has been said, the world isn't fair and possibly in the near future, Sally will get a job painting that Emma can't do.

Is her allergy that bad, or does she just not want the gig that badly?\n\nNo one's entitled to a job, even children, but if someone really wants a particular job they find a way to work around their inconveniences. Sounds like the kid just wants to get her hand in your pocket.", "NTA. \n\nSally needs to grow up and get over it. It\u2019s life.", "I would say yes, because life may not be fair? But you're essentially telling her you don't value her for something out of her own control. You're going to cause a rift between the two. But if your own mother has an issue with it?

If you cared at all for her feelings? You'd find something for her to do, trust me. There's always some work needing done. If she wants it? She'll work for it.

I couldn\u2019t do it, because pine trees bordered the land - but my brother could.

If I had the money, you can be sure I\u2019d use it to give my nieces a break (not to mention help teach the value of hard work, give a boost of confidence and self-worth, and provide a cash injection during gift-giving season!).\n\nYTA!", "People have very different ideas of what is \u201cgenerous\u201d.  What OP considers generous isn\u2019t necessarily above market rate.  There are people thinking they are \u201cgenerous\u201d paying babysitters $15/hr when in fact they are quite cheap.  Unless OP answers questions about what they actually pay, we just don\u2019t know.", "When I was a teen I also believed that teens are mature enough to do anything and I definitely didn't feel like a kid hahaha\n\nNow, as a 26yo I can see that that was totally BS lol\n\nTeens are like that, they believe they're grown ups and that they know everything and are right about anything. Thank the gods we grow up from that horrible phase hahahhaha", "I have. Constantly. The answer is always \"just shut up and take allergy meds you asshole\". Even if the person explains that the allergy meds don't work, or make them feel worse.\n\nThen it's always \"BUT WHAT IF YOU MEET A DOG IN PUBLIC!!!!!\".", "People downvoting me are completely out of touch with going rates for pet services, or they pay a neighbor kid $20 and think that\u2019s representative of the market.", "I don\u2019t think we get to decide whose feelings are \u201cworse\u201d\u2026there\u2019s no competition on trauma and sadness\u2026\n\nAlso, I might argue the opposite\u2026Emma\u2019s mom CHOSE to leave her behind\u2026while Sally\u2019s parents didn\u2019t make a choice\u2026\n\nWhen a parent makes a choice to not be there it could be 10x (or even 100x) harder\u2026\n\nYou never know\n\n(PS no where does OP say how LONG, but if the parents passed two years ago and mom is due back in 2024, that\u2019s 3 years and who\u2019s to say the mom will come back)", "Not spoiled entitled is a better word\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \nAgain if she wasn\u2019t allergic to dogs then I\u2019m sure they both can switch off each year. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t sympathize on this that\u2019s just the cards she was dealt which yes it does suck but that\u2019s just the way life is.", "Demand is not a word that appears in the OP. That's a word the commenters here have made up. And if you want to teach a child the polite way to ask for something, then you actually have to teach them. This kid has no parents to teach her. OP could have actually taken the opportunity to mentor her a bit, show her better ways to ask, give her ideas for how to increase her income. Instead she replied that \"sometimes life isn't fair,\" a lesson that a young orphan surely already knows.", "She was sad and upset. OP noticed and asked her what was wrong. Should Sally have lied? Do you really want to teach a child to hide her feelings from the only adult caregivers she has left?", "16 is 100% a child still. And her parents are fucking dead and you're worried thaf she'll be entitled? Learn some compassion and empathy. Damn", "And their chicks for free", "You could be right, as OP is a person who doesn't think an orphan should be \"coddled\" by her dead father's sister, but instead needs to be taught that \"life isn't fair.\" (Pretty confident she's already pieced that one together, what with two dead parents at 14.)\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a lot of actual generosity there.", "Be prepared for your 30s. Its going to happen again. Does not mean you're not mature now. Its just the way it goes. I consider aging kind of like leveling up in game.", "See, teens honestly have it worse than adults, and I say this as an adult. As a kid, you have a kid body and a kid mind. Adults have an adult body and an adult mind. Teens have an adult body with a kid mind. Just because sometimes a teenager can pass for an adult doesn't mean that the teen is in any way an adult. \n\nPeople can mention how years ago teens were expected to do a lot more, but that's common in hard times. Developmentally, teens are much better off now than years ago because they are able to gradually shift into adulthood, which is honestly a transition, not a bam. You're an adult. This is actually a good sign. Despite the insults, Gen z is proving to be a very resilient generation with a bright future ahead of them.", "What if you met MY dog?!", "The only thing I\u2019ve seen that to is people complaining about service dogs, which, yes, I agree it sucks but there\u2019s literally laws in place for it. I have extreme allergies, like, can\u2019t breath around certain animals, head to toe hives around people cutting grass, and sometimes you really do have to suck it up. Just walking past someone cutting their grass makes it hurt for me to breath for hours and I\u2019m covered in hives. People aren\u2019t going to stop cutting their grass, so I had to learn to deal with it, people also aren\u2019t going to stop having service dogs so people have to deal with it.", "No, I mean a worse situation to be in, not her feelings. \n\nI know, I was hoping OP would elaborate because she and her husband kind of sound like selfish jerks. Could she help Emma's mother but doesn't so she feels guilty, and then gives her a sweet gig when she can? \n\nI u derstand that we do not know her feelings for Sally but I cannot find one ounce of empathy for the kid in her initial post. She seems way more angry that anyone dares to tell her what to do with her money.", "If you can\u2019t find some sympathy for an orphan, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re someone I want to continue to talk to.", "she demanded a job and was rude. she isn't entitled to a job or money from her aunt. it sucks that she has an allergy that prevents her from dog sitting, but she is capable of finding another. if OP found her a job or gave her the money, she would be rewarding her attitude, and that's not ok. she's 16, she is old enough to know life isn't fair sometimes and that she won't always have the same opportunities as others. sucks but it's life.", "No but it's a learning moment.  Jealousy and entitlement are a bad look and a successful adult learns to to control that.  \"But kid is 16 and X has happened to them.\"  Right, the time to be learning that is now.\n\nIf she is still acting like that at 26, 36, 46, she will be judged 100% by her actions and attitude, and no one will know or care about her unfortunate past.", "Personally I don't like this attitude of teaching children the harsh lessons in life like this. Now throw in the child lost both parents. OP is an AH and is self righteous about it over a kid that already learned harsher lessons than any child should.", "I still can't get past OP thinking her orphaned niece needs to be taught that life isn't fair.", "I know some 50 year old children", "Stop equating youth with being a tiny helpless baby who doesn't know any better.", "No. Not even a little bit. Stop robbing capable people of their agency. Stop infantilizing adults.\n\n20 is not 40, people are *different* at all stages of life. But 20 is an adult. If you believe a 20 year old is a child then your definition for what constitutes a child is absolutely insane and *detached from reality*.\n\nLiterally no one who researches brain development would call someone who is 20 a **child**. The only salient question on a scientific level is whether they are still adolescents - which in this technical context means they are necessarily *not* children, they are *either* adolescents *or* adults. But no one considers them *children,* and the term adolescents in this context is a very dry clinical term that simply acknowledges that there us still brain development happening.\n\nIt's a very short walk from infantilizing everyone you find *too young* to take seriously to denying them agency and disenfranchising them. I can't help but side eye people who so emphatically want to argue fully capable people are hopelessly dependent children who need guidance, who conflate having a modest amount of development to undergo as being woefully underdeveloped. \n\nIt's like suggesting the only chess players that exist are beginners, and grandmasters, after all everyone who isn't a GM still has *so much development to do* as if that's somehow a more meaningful and informative fact that the wide disparity in *development* between *everyone* who isn't a GM. It's like claiming a medical resident is not a *doctor* because they are still being educated. Surprise though: They *are* a doctor, both practically and professionally, *and* are still being educated.", "Yep. I remember being 28 looking at the decisions I made and things I said and believed when I was 20 and cringing so hard. Now that I\u2019m 34\u2026 the emotional maturity gains are both a blessing and a curse, ha.", "I've seen it about non-service dogs plenty of times. Usually people bringing animals into grocery stores or restaurants.\n\nAlso, allergies are not a matter of just 'dealing' with it but actually considered a disability under the ADA as well. A service dog does not outrank someone with allergies; and if there is an issue, it's required to find a solution for both parties. Not just saying tough luck to allergies, but finding appropriate accommodations for both parties.\n\nIt's great that you can just suck it up. But not everyone can.", "Op didn't create an opportunity for anyone. She needed a dog sitter. It's op's mom who demands op to creatw an opportunity for sally", "\"I'm not cruel,\" neither is OP, but you do sound a bit ridiculous", "The OP doesn\u2019t use the word demand. You made that up.", "Yeah, Sally was reacting like a 16-year-old, but this is where her grandparents should have stepped in with her (instead of with OP) to gently explain to her that, while it's natural she's disappointed, her aunt doesn't \"owe\" her a job, and a much better approach would be to remind her aunt that she's sorry she can't help, but it's because of the allergy, and add that she'd love an opportunity to help her out and earn some money at the same time if possible should a different opportunity come up that she *can* help with.\n\nOP probably would have been more willing to come up with something if Sally had taken that approach...by behaving sulkily and like she was being hard done by, Sally actually pushed OP into a mindset where she felt less inclined to help her. It was a perfect opportunity for someone to show Sally that *how* you approach things can help you get ahead better than acting like you're owed something. Most kids can't be expected to learn that on their own, and if OP does what her parents ask, Sally won't learn it, and later it may prevent her from other opportunities at a time when she really needs them.", "This is not the way to teach her anything. Tough love actually really doesn\u2019t work. And it especially doesn\u2019t work on people with a significant trauma history.", "I was going to comment the same thing. Both need to be considered.", "I'll agree that what OP is doing may not be the best way to teach her how to act right, but rewarding how she has gone about this currently would certainly set her back."]}
