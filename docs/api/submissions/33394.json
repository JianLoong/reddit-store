My parents are there with my two nieces, Sally and Emma (both 16). Sally is my brother's who passed away along with his wife 2 years ago and my parents are now her guardian. Emma is my sister's who is currently working oversea for a few years. She went to stay with my parents about the same time Sally did and her mom is due back in the middle of 2024. Emma's father has never been in her life.\n\nMy husband's family lives a few hours away and we always spend the December holiday with them while my parents get Thanksgiving. Ever since the girls moved in with my parents, I offered them the chance to pet sit my dogs for my husband and me. They would need to take them on walks and feed them and all that. We offered a rather generous pay for the job.\n\nSally is allergic to dogs while Emma is not. Emma took the job and did well and has been our December pet sitter for a couple years now as well as the occasional shorter term sitter other part of the year. Last week I went to visit my parents and to ask Emma if she will take pet sitting again which she happily said yes. I noticed that Sally was a bit sulky and asked her what was wrong. Sally said that Emma was lucky to be working for me at such a great pay and that she's guaranteed a job every December while Sally has to work minimum wage with the occasional baby sitting jobs. Sally said I should get her a job, too, to be fair.\n\nI told her I don't create jobs just to hire people for them. The jobs were just there, needing to be done, and it is unfortunate but not my fault that she's not qualified for a job I am in need of. Sally said an allergy is not something she can control and Emma shouldn't get to reap the benefits and it's not fair. I told her sometimes life isn't fair and suggests she finds what she can do and make the most out of it.\n\nMy mom later called me and said I was being insensitive and maybe I could have Sally help file my documents or something. I told her I would be wasting money and time having Sally do something that doesn't need to be done. My mom said my husband and I are well off enough we can spare a few hundred bucks this holiday to save Sally's feelings. \n\nI don't believe in coddling and I think Sally needs to learn things can't always go her way.

You don't owe her equal opportunity with her cousin.\n\nIf it was me? I probably would try and find her a job. But I'd make it a \"real\" job.

Maybe you should have been paying her the going rate to begin with. \n\nThat being said, do you live in a place with a yard? You could get her to do yardwork if so. That needs to be done and if you have the money to pay her for like, weeding, then maybe that\u2019s a job you could offer her. \n\nI do feel bad for her losing both her parents. That would be really rough.", "I think Sally probably knows things don\u2019t always go her way.  Her parents are dead.  \nThat doesn\u2019t obligate you.

I\u2019m not saying you have to give her a job (though I think it would be a kindness to your family if you found something Sally could do to earn money, because it really does otherwise appear you\u2019re favoring Emma), but you need to be kind to her, or else you should stay away from both girls until you can be.", "INFO - are you paying Emma market rate? Or are you overpaying her because she's your niece?  \nIf you are giving Emma a cushy job as a favor to a family member (which is a totally natural thing to do), I understand why Sally is unhappy, and you are being insensitive. You don't owe her a job or anything else, but it's not shocking that a child hopes for fairness from her family.", "Soft YTA. You say you give \"rather generous pay\" for the dogsitting. So it sounds like this is your way of giving money to Emma, but not Sally.\n\nExample: say a pet sitting service (like Rover? I'm not a pet owner, but I'm aware these things exist) would charge $50 a day, but you are paying $100. That is extra money that you are gifting Emma because she is your niece. But you are not gifting Sally anything.  Hence, the imbalance.\n\nI would always pay my sons \"generously\" because it was a way to slide them some extra money but tie it to work/reward when they were kids, and later,  when they were older,  so it didn't feel like a handout to them. Your comment about generous pay sounds to me like you're doing the same thing. \n\nSo the suggestion that you find something for Sally to do is not really off the wall. Yardwork/gardening if she can't be in the house with the dogs? And of course, pay generously.\n\nOr just pay Emma the normal rate for her services.", "NTA, but perhaps if you hear of any work that pays better than average over the holidays you could let her know about it.", "NTA but I don't think Sally runs the risk of being \"coddled\". Her parents are dead, she knows life isn't fair. I don't think it's your responsibility to find Sally a job, but it sure would be a good deed if found something she could help out with, like garden work or such. She wants to earn her money, which is commendable, and has been dealt a shit hand with her allergies. She not asking for hand-outs just a chance to get some money like her cousin. If I were you I would do something for Sally so she doesn't feel completely left out.", "YTA for even offering her the job because of her allergies. Sally never even had a chance to watch the dogs. I don\u2019t blame you for not creating work for Sally, but of course she\u2019s going to be jealous her cousin is getting \u2018generous pay\u2019 for a cushy job that she simply can\u2019t even attempt to do. The generous pay part sounds like you\u2019re paying Emma extra just for being your niece. \n\nAlso, you\u2019re the AH for suggesting an orphan doesn\u2019t already know very well life isn\u2019t fair.", "NTA\n\nYou have one job that MUST be done by someone and Emma can do it. You don't owe Sally anything, especially a made-up job. That's just the way life is. 16 is old enough to learn it.\n\n If Emma happened to qualify for a sports team at school and Sally didn't, would Sally feel she was owed something to be equal?", "What does Sally mean \"get her a job\"? If Sally is truly allergic to dogs, there's really not much of anything you can hire her to do, as being in your home where the dogs live isn't an option.  \n\nBest you can do is offer to recommend Sally if you hear of a friend needing help that Sally's qualified to do.", "Technically YTA - have some empathy.

Big time. It's not your responsibility to find her a job, but she's a young teen who lost both her parents, and obviously she understands she can't have everything her way, based on the hand life has dealt her. It would do you some good to be less judgmental and be more sympathetic to Sally's situation, because in her mind, she is probably overthinking this situation, and imagining that so many things in her life are against her. \n\nYou don't need to coddle her, but be kind to her. Life is not easy, but you don't need to be rude when showing someone that. You're in the right in terms of actions, but not with the way you handled it with her.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s like needing a lifeguard for your pool and then offering the job to the person who can swim.

Sally is 16. This is something she needs to accept and understand.", "Nta, not everyone is qualified for every job. Whether it be talent or an allergy. One girl has the ability to do the job you need. The other one doesn't. You are not required to hire everybody just because you hired one.

Surely there\u2019s parts of the job that can be done by Sally that are not dependent on interaction. Getting supplies from the shops for the dog or anything, for instance? There are many parts here that can apply to both without causing a medical incident.", "NTA. I probably go overboard trying to make things fair for people, but this one is beyond even me.

She already knows life is unfair and won't always go her way, she lost both her parents. You didn't need to rub it in her face that one more thing in life didn't go her way, i.e. her allergies. You don't have to coddle her but Sally is going to take it as favoritism towards Emma that only she gets a job from their Aunt and that's going to create a rift between them. It's a tough position to be in but maybe you could sit both girls down and tell them you made a mistake you couldn't have foreseen the consequences of and didn't mean to come between them or hurt either of their feelings, but it'd probably be best to have Emma stop dog sitting since you don't have a different job to offer Sally.", "Omg girl dangling participle much.

While Emma is benefitting from an easy job for lots of pay now, Sally is getting real life skills. She's dealing with customers, learning to meet different needs, and making connections with people that might be willing to be a reference for her later. An aunt is not a great reference in comparison. Watching dogs during vacation is not college application material to write about.

But since even a made up job would be where the dogs are, Sally still wouldn't be able to do that. And as has been said, the world isn't fair and possibly in the near future, Sally will get a job painting that Emma can't do.

I couldn\u2019t do it, because pine trees bordered the land - but my brother could. The only reason he even knew about the job was because I babysat the farmer\u2019s kids for way less an hour than his seasonal farm hands made. And my brother made teenage bank.

No. But would it be a kindness to offer work for the allergic orphan niece? Yes. \n\nI don\u2019t think OP is wrong, but I do think the orphaned niece deserves some kindness that OP could give.

My cousins are all older than me. We live very close to each other and our grandparents. When they were little, the cousins were at my grandparent's house a lot. By the time I was born, my grandparents had more health issues (so they naturally would have seen me less), but they were also burnt out and unwilling to have me there as much as the cousins. My family got the short end of the stick because my cousin's family had no boundaries. \n\nWe all get older, and all the cousins get jobs through my grandparents. I didn't, mostly due to age. That's fine, I understand the realities of it fully, but I already didn't grow up around them as much, and was excluded from the extra work, and was just much more disconnected in general. \n\nThen every side of the family was surprised when I was a teenager and young adult that didn't have a relationship with my grandparents, and I didn't go out of my way to build one. It was especially hilarious when my cousins would try to be, 'Remember all this [grandparents] stuff,' and how we were all 'so close.'\n\nNo. No we weren't. \n\nThe reason I'm mentioning this is because OP is in the right, technically. But this is going to backlash on her later in the closeness of her relationship, because a 16 year old orphan is telling her she feels left out or disincluded from the same opportunities and familial help.
