My parents are there with my two nieces, Sally and Emma (both 16). Sally is my brother's who passed away along with his wife 2 years ago and my parents are now her guardian. Emma is my sister's who is currently working oversea for a few years. She went to stay with my parents about the same time Sally did and her mom is due back in the middle of 2024. Emma's father has never been in her life.\n\nMy husband's family lives a few hours away and we always spend the December holiday with them while my parents get Thanksgiving. Ever since the girls moved in with my parents, I offered them the chance to pet sit my dogs for my husband and me. They would need to take them on walks and feed them and all that. We offered a rather generous pay for the job.\n\nSally is allergic to dogs while Emma is not. Emma took the job and did well and has been our December pet sitter for a couple years now as well as the occasional shorter term sitter other part of the year. Last week I went to visit my parents and to ask Emma if she will take pet sitting again which she happily said yes. I noticed that Sally was a bit sulky and asked her what was wrong. Sally said that Emma was lucky to be working for me at such a great pay and that she's guaranteed a job every December while Sally has to work minimum wage with the occasional baby sitting jobs. Sally said I should get her a job, too, to be fair.\n\nI told her I don't create jobs just to hire people for them. The jobs were just there, needing to be done, and it is unfortunate but not my fault that she's not qualified for a job I am in need of. Sally said an allergy is not something she can control and Emma shouldn't get to reap the benefits and it's not fair. I told her sometimes life isn't fair and suggests she finds what she can do and make the most out of it.\n\nMy mom later called me and said I was being insensitive and maybe I could have Sally help file my documents or something. I told her I would be wasting money and time having Sally do something that doesn't need to be done. My mom said my husband and I are well off enough we can spare a few hundred bucks this holiday to save Sally's feelings. \n\nI don't believe in coddling and I think Sally needs to learn things can't always go her way.

You don't owe her equal opportunity with her cousin.\n\nIf it was me? I probably would try and find her a job. But I'd make it a \"real\" job.

Maybe you should have been paying her the going rate to begin with. \n\nThat being said, do you live in a place with a yard? You could get her to do yardwork if so. That needs to be done and if you have the money to pay her for like, weeding, then maybe that\u2019s a job you could offer her. \n\nI do feel bad for her losing both her parents. That would be really rough.", "I think Sally probably knows things don\u2019t always go her way.  Her parents are dead.  \nThat doesn\u2019t obligate you.

I\u2019m not saying you have to give her a job (though I think it would be a kindness to your family if you found something Sally could do to earn money, because it really does otherwise appear you\u2019re favoring Emma), but you need to be kind to her, or else you should stay away from both girls until you can be.", "INFO - are you paying Emma market rate? Or are you overpaying her because she's your niece?  \nIf you are giving Emma a cushy job as a favor to a family member (which is a totally natural thing to do), I understand why Sally is unhappy, and you are being insensitive. You don't owe her a job or anything else, but it's not shocking that a child hopes for fairness from her family.", "Soft YTA. You say you give \"rather generous pay\" for the dogsitting. So it sounds like this is your way of giving money to Emma, but not Sally.\n\nExample: say a pet sitting service (like Rover? I'm not a pet owner, but I'm aware these things exist) would charge $50 a day, but you are paying $100. That is extra money that you are gifting Emma because she is your niece. But you are not gifting Sally anything.  Hence, the imbalance.\n\nI would always pay my sons \"generously\" because it was a way to slide them some extra money but tie it to work/reward when they were kids, and later,  when they were older,  so it didn't feel like a handout to them. Your comment about generous pay sounds to me like you're doing the same thing. \n\nSo the suggestion that you find something for Sally to do is not really off the wall. Yardwork/gardening if she can't be in the house with the dogs? And of course, pay generously.\n\nOr just pay Emma the normal rate for her services.", "NTA, but perhaps if you hear of any work that pays better than average over the holidays you could let her know about it.", "NTA but I don't think Sally runs the risk of being \"coddled\". Her parents are dead, she knows life isn't fair. I don't think it's your responsibility to find Sally a job, but it sure would be a good deed if found something she could help out with, like garden work or such. She wants to earn her money, which is commendable, and has been dealt a shit hand with her allergies. She not asking for hand-outs just a chance to get some money like her cousin. If I were you I would do something for Sally so she doesn't feel completely left out.", "YTA for even offering her the job because of her allergies. Sally never even had a chance to watch the dogs. I don\u2019t blame you for not creating work for Sally, but of course she\u2019s going to be jealous her cousin is getting \u2018generous pay\u2019 for a cushy job that she simply can\u2019t even attempt to do. The generous pay part sounds like you\u2019re paying Emma extra just for being your niece. \n\nAlso, you\u2019re the AH for suggesting an orphan doesn\u2019t already know very well life isn\u2019t fair.", "NTA\n\nYou have one job that MUST be done by someone and Emma can do it. You don't owe Sally anything, especially a made-up job. That's just the way life is. 16 is old enough to learn it.\n\n If Emma happened to qualify for a sports team at school and Sally didn't, would Sally feel she was owed something to be equal?", "What does Sally mean \"get her a job\"? If Sally is truly allergic to dogs, there's really not much of anything you can hire her to do, as being in your home where the dogs live isn't an option.  \n\nBest you can do is offer to recommend Sally if you hear of a friend needing help that Sally's qualified to do.", "Technically YTA - have some empathy.

Big time. It's not your responsibility to find her a job, but she's a young teen who lost both her parents, and obviously she understands she can't have everything her way, based on the hand life has dealt her. It would do you some good to be less judgmental and be more sympathetic to Sally's situation, because in her mind, she is probably overthinking this situation, and imagining that so many things in her life are against her. \n\nYou don't need to coddle her, but be kind to her. Life is not easy, but you don't need to be rude when showing someone that. You're in the right in terms of actions, but not with the way you handled it with her.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s like needing a lifeguard for your pool and then offering the job to the person who can swim.

Sally is 16. This is something she needs to accept and understand.", "Nta, not everyone is qualified for every job. Whether it be talent or an allergy. One girl has the ability to do the job you need. The other one doesn't. You are not required to hire everybody just because you hired one.

Surely there\u2019s parts of the job that can be done by Sally that are not dependent on interaction. Getting supplies from the shops for the dog or anything, for instance? There are many parts here that can apply to both without causing a medical incident.", "NTA. I probably go overboard trying to make things fair for people, but this one is beyond even me.

She already knows life is unfair and won't always go her way, she lost both her parents. You didn't need to rub it in her face that one more thing in life didn't go her way, i.e. her allergies. You don't have to coddle her but Sally is going to take it as favoritism towards Emma that only she gets a job from their Aunt and that's going to create a rift between them. It's a tough position to be in but maybe you could sit both girls down and tell them you made a mistake you couldn't have foreseen the consequences of and didn't mean to come between them or hurt either of their feelings, but it'd probably be best to have Emma stop dog sitting since you don't have a different job to offer Sally.", "Omg girl dangling participle much.

While Emma is benefitting from an easy job for lots of pay now, Sally is getting real life skills. She's dealing with customers, learning to meet different needs, and making connections with people that might be willing to be a reference for her later. An aunt is not a great reference in comparison. Watching dogs during vacation is not college application material to write about.

But since even a made up job would be where the dogs are, Sally still wouldn't be able to do that. And as has been said, the world isn't fair and possibly in the near future, Sally will get a job painting that Emma can't do.

I couldn\u2019t do it, because pine trees bordered the land - but my brother could. The only reason he even knew about the job was because I babysat the farmer\u2019s kids for way less an hour than his seasonal farm hands made. And my brother made teenage bank.

No. But would it be a kindness to offer work for the allergic orphan niece? Yes. \n\nI don\u2019t think OP is wrong, but I do think the orphaned niece deserves some kindness that OP could give.

Tell her mom to pay Sally for extra chores at home the same rate your are for doing the dog sitting.", "Even if op agreed to give Sally job to file paperwork it would be more work to op. As dogs would need to be put away, house deep cleaned of fur etc. Just not cause niece to have allergic reaction.", "You didn't include a judgment here.", "This. Something about the tone of the post is off putting. This is a sixteen year old child who is well aware that life isn\u2019t fair \u2014 her parents are dead. You don\u2019t have to coddle her but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to show her a bit of empathy or understanding. Telling a child who\u2019s lost their parents so young that life isn\u2019t fair screams asshole to me. \n\nYou\u2019ll get tons of people telling you you\u2019re not an asshole because you technically haven\u2019t done anything wrong. You just lack care or consideration for your niece and you sound cold. \n\nI hope she has some supportive adults in her life.", "This. \n\nOP mentions they offer Emma a \"very generous pay\" for the dog sitting, which frames this job more as a favour to a family member. \n\nIf that's the case, I feel OP's response is quite cold and veers towards AH territory, and I personally dislike the whole \"the world is unfair, I don't condone coddling\" mindset. Yes, the world isn't fair, it doesn't mean that you have to keep it this way when you can actually do something about it. \n\nIf OP is overpaying Emma, they should do something for Sally too, not giving her a job necessarily, but maybe offer help finding a better one.", "In the end, it\u2019s not only about owing stuff, right? This is not a legal advice forum.", "This is really fair criticism regarding the pay and I hope it\u2019s not overlooked because you wrote YTA. \n\nAlso agreed with yardwork.", "Holiday rates are more expensive and some areas are just plain more expensive. It's also for 2 dogs, not 1, so more expensive. I didn't see where OP specified the rate of pay by day.", "It depends, if OP is offering a generous pay to Emma as a way to give money to Emma, then you are right. However, if OP is offering generous pay because it is the holidays (higher demand for pet sitting) or just because OP cares about dogs, she shouldn't be expected to create a new job and pay generously just to make it \"even\".", "I wish I could upvote you a thousand times!  I love your Rover example, and it\u2019s exactly what I was thinking, but you explained the imbalance so well!!", "Even if she was paying her the standard $50/day she wouldn't even need to work 3.5 days/week to make the same amount as a teen working a full 25 hrs/week at minimum wage. Not to mention one sister is having taxes deducted from her paycheck on top of that....", "Great analogy. I definitely agree with this. OP, absolutely NTA.", "How is going to the store to buy dog food any different than the make-busy-work file her document job that OP's mom suggest. It would just be creating a job that does unnecessary work so OP can funnel money to Sally.", "I\u2019m sorry, but getting stuff from the store for the dogs isn\u2019t usually part of pet sitting. Usually, you as the pet owner would make sure the animals have everything needed before somebody else takes care of them. \nAnd even if you instructed her to go and get all that stuff before you left, like that\u2019s probably 30min worth of work tops.\n\nWith dogs it\u2019s usually feeding, giving medicine if applicable, making sure they get bathroom breaks as needed, and taking them on walks, possibly even brushing. \n\nI understand the sentiment but when it comes to pet sitting there isn\u2019t really anything that you can do that\u2019s \u201cnot dependent on interaction\u201d. The very nature of the job is pet interaction.", "Okay, I\u2019m making a second comment because there is one \u201clow interaction\u201d job I can think of that does come up with pet care that I didn\u2019t list, dog poop clean up in the yard. \n\nShe could be hired to clean up dog poop. Not glamorous, and she will probably balk at the idea, but yah that\u2019s one thing she could do when it comes to pet care.", "I agree with most of your comment. \n\nWork and family (working with and/or for family that is) is always a tricky thing to navigate and that\u2019s lost on a lot of the judgments.\n\nThat being said, I get wanting to use your niece over a random person for pet sitting, because of the trust factor.", "Pretty sure the orphaned child knows some things about the real world and how it works.", "You don\u2019t think both of her parents dying when she was 14 taught her how unfair life can be?", "Her parents both died. I\u2019d say life is already beating the hell out of her.", "Making up some random job for Sally would just teach her that all she has to do is throw a temper tantrum and she'll get her way. If Sally really actually  had good work ethic she would sat down with her and uncle to discuss what skills she has that might be useful to them. Instead all she did was tattle on her aunt and uncle like a child. \n\nNTA", "On the other hand: the entire part of the pay that is 'generous' (the part that is above market rates) is basically a gift from aunt to one niece and not to the other.", "Any job op could come up with would probably mean inside of the house.  With the dogs.  Unless the kid wants to do outdoor tasks like mowing.", "So your solution is to punish the person who's doing a good and responsible job? How about her mother simply stops meddling, instead?", "Depending on the severity, an allergy med may not do anything or she's already taking one daily.  \n\nI'm allergic to cats and take two allergy medicines daily for \"seasonal\" (year-round for me) allergies and did allergy shots for 5 years. I still can't be around cats long term, especially long-haired or ones that shed a lot. \n\nBenadryl probably wouldn't be realistic because of the significant drowsiness it causes. There's a reason it's the primary ingredient in some over-the-counter sleep aids (Zzyquil for one).", "I don't know if Sally could do any household work since the house is filled with allergens she's allergic to.", "She is allergic to their dogs, what jobs can she do in their home?", "While I agree that the niece could use some kindness, I disagree that her attitude should be rewarded. She felt entitled to OP giving her a job. That kind of victim mindset doesn\u2019t work in the real world and shouldn\u2019t be encouraged. \n\nIf OP does end up finding a job the niece can do, like gardening or spring cleaning, the job offer should only be made at a sufficiently distant time from now. This is so that the niece doesn\u2019t get any ideas that she was right and that it\u2019s only fair that she deserves this job.", "So OP has to find money and a job out of thin air for the other niece?  Which is then not fair to the other niece.    Allergies are not fun but are no excuse for preferential treatment.    If others are so worried they can give her a job and the money.   I bet she won't like housecleaning though.", "Babysitters always made more than the farmhands where I grew up. I lucked into something better than both. But if I was doing the farmhand thing I'd have been very jealous of the girls with babysitting gigs.", "Has she considered stop being poor?", "Oops. Thanks!", "Yeah...reddit seems to have a thing against people with dog allergies. It's worse when you consider one sister is having part of her aleady lower wage taken out for taxes on top of it. I'd be curious to know the income disparity between the sisters. Or if the situation was reversed if op would act the same", "It\u2019ll never be \u201ceven\u201d between Sally and Emma because Emma\u2019s parents aren\u2019t both dead.", "This is true. But I mean day to day life. Jobs won\u2019t be made just for her, because she wants them.", "The difference though? Sally's parents are dead and Emma's isn't. She's being a terrible aunt regardless, because she is essentially providing for the child who has a living parent to take care of her, while she lets her deceased brothers child [and her mothers deceased too,] not work for her because of a simple allergy. There's medications for such things. It would be better to let neither of them do it.", "Are you kidding me?! Sally's parents are dead. Emma has a living parent, albeit overseas. It was their grandmother that contacted the poster and told her she was being insensitive. Sally has already been thrown the life ain't fair bone. The OP is literally telling her deceased brothers child [and her mothers dead too] she is worthless to her for something outside of her control. At least Emma has a parent to provide for her other than the OP's own mother, the childs grandmother.", "Sigh. I wish allergies were better understood. \u201cCan\u2019t you just take a pill?\u201d  Um, no. No I can\u2019t just take a pill and cure an autoimmune response that threatens to kill me via asthma attack or constricted throat.", "Sally is literally an orphan. If the worst she\u2019s doing at 16 is asking for a job and getting a little upset that she makes way less money for way more work than someone who is effectively her sibling, I think she\u2019s handling everything pretty well, and her mindset is just fine.", "Ok but also, she is a CHILD? Like why do you expect a CHILD to respond to horrific circumstances out of her control with aplomb?", "> If others are so worried they can give her a job and the money.  \n\nWhy can't OPs mum aka Sally's grandmother hire her over Xmas. Oh that's right because then the money wouldn't be coming out of OPs bank account. I wouldn't be surprised if OPs mum might have started this.", "You're accusing her of being a terrible aunt because she's not making up unneeded busy work because the kid is a orphan???\n\nSally never offered to take allergy medicine so she would have the same opportunities as Emma.\n\nSorry but life's not going to give her any special treatment.", "No, she's found a dogsitter in the family to take care of her dogs, nothing more nothing less.  If medications work for Sally, then she probably would have brought that option up earlier.", "Quick clarification here: \"her mother\" meant \"Op's mother\".", "I wouldn't consider 16 a \"child\", it's an age where you are starting to run out of time on making sure they don't turn into adults with entitled attitudes", "Yes, I call her a terrible aunt. Because instead of actually hiring someone to do the job? She literally picks  cinderella's sister who doesn't have to work because she has a mother to provide for her.\n\nWhereas poor Cinderella gets to slave away at a minimum wage job, barely affording **** while she gets to watch the non-orphan get money handed to her. Taking care of pets is easy. At least Sally has a work ethic. \n\nBut, if your family has the habit of making all the kids hate each other? That's on you. -_- I side with the OP's mother. She is being insensitive. Especially if she's well off. She could literally consult her husband. I bet he's got 20 chores lined up he's put off for God knows how long. We all do it. They could find her work, she chooses not to.", "I guess I'm just built different then. Because I'd take her feelings into consideration being the child of a deceased sibling. I'd be the AH and let neither of them do it or find a friend who's free.", "Correct. The OP was saying her mother called her to tell her she was being insensitive to Sally. Sally and Emma are her nieces, which are currently living with her mother, their grandmother. Sally, the one with the allergies? The OP stated her mother/father are dead, whereas Emma's are alive. Sally is the child of her deceased brother and Emma is the child of her sister, whom is overseas for work. Sally, the child with dead parents cannot work for her due to her allergy, so she has to work a minimum wage job. Emma doesn't have to work a minimum wage job. So the OP has essentially created a massive wage gap between the two and it literally sounds intentional to me at this point.", "Sally had two parents die at the same time. Pretty sure she learned at a young age that she\u2019s not entitled to things other people have, like parents.", "None of which Sally can do at their house because THE DOGS LIVE THERE AND SALLY IS ALLERGIC!", "Is Sally has not shown worth ethic only that she has the ability to complain.\n\nAnd Emma is not being handed money she actually works for it, pets are a big responsibility... And Sally would rather whine about fairness than take allergy medicine so she could do the same job as Emma. \n\nAnd all of those chores OP could line up is going to be in the house with the dogs that she's allergic to, So how the heck is that supposed to work....\n\nIt's going to be quite a while before any outdoor chores would be necessary and I don't know if Sally operates lawn mowers.", "That assumes that op has someone else around like that."]}
