It's weird to come on reddit and ask for a judgment rather than communicate/listen to your fianc\u00e9s feelings.\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nI would have concerns in your fiance's place  It seems like a pretty big omission that could have been resolved with a text at the time.  Or after.  Your post makes it sound like you didn't tell her at all and she found out through some other means.  The whole thing sounds sketchy TBH.", "How long have you been with your fiance? She hasn't met your ex gf/bestie and is \"nervous\" about your relationship so instead of trying to address the issue and introduce these 2 important people in your life you opt to ignore your pregnant fiance's feelings and spend the day with your ex?  And are justifying it by saying \"it never came up.\" Maybe try to make your fiance feel comfortable and secure instead of inflaming the stress and distrust. YTA", "~~I'm leaning NTA.~~ Nevermind, YTA, See Edit.\n\nI get why your fianc\u00e9 is upset that you missed her texts, and I get why the timing of you missing those texts looked pretty bad on her end, but it doesn't seem to me you actually did anything wrong. Your fianc\u00e9 knew at the beginning of your relationship that you were close friends with your ex and liked spending time with her. She chose to date you anyway, seemingly despite not *actually* being ok with that. You didn't mislead her or spring it on her several months in.\n\nIt frankly comes off as though she *never* trusted you with her and was *never* ok with it and just waited until now for that to finally come to a head. Which I again maintain is not your fault; if she wasn't ok with dating someone who was close friends with his ex she could've not dated you.\n\n---\n\nEdit: Ok actually, just saw this comment\n\n> [They are in two different circles and **my ex lives about 1.5 hours away.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13f2b8t/aita_for_not_being_transparent_with_my_fianc%C3%A9/jjsxvar/)\n\nThat *really* changes things. You wandered off an hour and a half away from home without planning it, without telling your pregnant fianc\u00e9, and then ignored your phone all day while you were there. I don't care who you were visiting, what the fuck? What if she had an emergency, or urgently needed you, and that's the moment she finds out that if you drop everything and leave instantly you'll be there in an hour and a half? I'm sure she's even more upset because she's seemingly not really ok with your friendship anyway, but even setting that aside, nah, that was shitty of you, YTA.\n\nEdit 2: y'know re-reading it? Forget what your fianc\u00e9 thinks, *I* think you're cheating on her. It \"never came up\" that you were going to be an hour and a half away with your ex all day ignoring your phone? That's sketchy as fuck, it's dishonest, and makes it seem like you've got something to hide.", "YTA. Purposeful omission is the same as lying. Honestly even to me you sound too close to your ex. like it or not it\u2019s time to move on emotionally as well as physically. You also have to see how dodgy not answering calls and then not being forthcoming is. If I was dating you I\u2019d dump you.", "Yta. \n\nYes, it's OK to be friends with an ex.

You\u2019re allowed to be friends but the fact you didn\u2019t answer your phone and she found out from others you were with your ex automatically makes you the bad guy, sorry but that\u2019s the way it is. Being pregnant she already feels more emotional and vulnerable and she\u2019s going to feel less attractive to you, you spending time with another woman is only going to worsen her feelings as the pregnancy progresses. If your fianc\u00e9 and your child really are your priority why don\u2019t you treat her like one?

You know your fiance is uncomfortable about the friendship and you have not made efforts to introduce them at all. Different friend groups is nothing if you are the mutual connection.\n\n2.

You spent a whole day not in town while your finace worked an hour and a half away. And she had no clue. She has every right to be upset about your trip as you went far and never told her! \n\nSeriously, do not be this obtuse! You have a serious issue with prioritizing your ex over your pregnant fiance.", "So reading your comments you made plans a week ahead of time travelling over 1.5hours away and you never mentioned this to you fianc\u00e9e \n\nAnd then didn\u2019t think it important enough to talk with the pregnant mother of your child?", "YTA.\n\nI'm just dropping my opinion on this: I would not date, much less **marry** anyone that is besties with their ex. absolutely wild.", "Your fiance has never met your best friend, who is your ex? Suuuuuuuus YTA", "YTA a bit - not for hanging out with your ex, but for your failure of communication. This is a new situation, and your fianc\u00e9 is carrying your child. I think you can stir yourself to be a little more considerate than usual and let her know as soon as you noticed the missed texts that you were sorry you missed them but you were eating and watching a movie with your friend's family. \n\nYou're in the clear if you didn't have plans to meet up with her, but just try to be a little more considerate of her feelings. I don't want to say she's being hormonal with pregnancy, but the fact is that can also contribute and you should be extra respectful of her feelings now.", "YTA.

Missing a few calls, not mentioning it, not introducing your fianc\u00e9. All pretty sketch. \n\nI don\u2019t think you are ready to move on.

You are, essentially, cheating on your fianc\u00e9e but you won\u2019t see it this way.

There\u2019s being friends with an ex and then there\u2019s this. That they\u2019ve never met immediately shows you\u2019re hiding something. And I\u2019m sorry but you\u2019re too close. If you ever want to truly be in a relationship with someone else it\u2019s time to distance yourself.

You sound like an immature teenager.  \n\nAll I hear is I and my ex. Your fianc\u00e9 sounds like a fricking baby incubator and acquaintance to you. \n\nDo you only use her?
