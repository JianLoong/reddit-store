We all grew up together and it's the first time I've seen them since before covid, so they also met my husband for the first time. (We had a courthouse ceremony.) \n\nWe were talking about ordering pizza and having a few drinks together and I was getting our orders together. I LOVE pesto, ricotta, mushrooms, spinach, olives, and artichoke on a flat bread crust. My husband (Rick) is a deep dish meat lovers guy to the core. So I asked Rick if he wants the usual. He made a face and said, no meat lovers disgusts him and I know that and how much he loves the pizza I like. I was confused and reminded Rick that he's said countless times he hates my favorite pizza and that's why we always order two. Rick continued to insist I'm wrong. He looked at my cousins and friends and asked, has she always been this much of a scatterbrain? I swear if her head wasn't attached to her neck she'd be walking around without it. (I'm definitely known as the forgetful/clumsy one in the group.) \n\nThis is also when it dawned on me Rick is trying to be funny by making me look ditzy and forgetful. I didn't feel like dealing with it, so I played a long like, omg baby, you are so right! I forgot, you know how I can be. Of course I remember now, I'm sorry sweetie, let me get that for you. Rick laughed and was like, yep, that's my wife, gotta love her but it's a miracle she remembers her own name.\n\nI put in the orders and when they get here, Rick is looking for his. I hand him a small box that has the identical pizza to mine in it. He pulls me aside to ask what the hell that is? I told him it's his pizza he just told everyone he loves. Rick looked at it with an expression of sheer disgust and asked where is his meat lovers pizza. I told him he said he didn't want that and how he wanted this so I made sure to order it. Rick got huffy and complained he can't eat that pizza, it's gross and thought I'd order him a meat lovers either way because I know it's his favorite and he was just playing around earlier. I told him I am absolutely not ordering anything else since the pizza place was closing soon and if he wants a different meal to figure it out for himself but he got what he asked for so he can explain why he's refusing to eat. Rick said I'm unfair to put him in that position, made an excuse to my cousins and friends about having a stomachache and needing to get up early and went to bed. \n\nWe all wound down about an hour or so later and I got ready for bed. Rick was still awake and asked if there was anything for him to eat and I reminded him that he has a pizza in the fridge. He rolled over and went to sleep but he's upset with me today, saying I forced him to go hungry last night.", "created_utc": 1680536945, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12aofon/aita_for_ordering_the_pizza_my_husband_said_he/", "score": 326, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Jokers are fun, not manipulating.\n\nNTA, but I'd pay more attention to the \"jokes\" and people's reaction to them. Humiliating you for the sake of laugh is bullying. Lying to everyone in the face and making you smaller and degrading you so he can be funny is not a \"jokester\" play. It's an Asshole play. \n\nBe aware, friend.

They're both calling it a joke but it is not a joke.", "If this is a pattern of behaviour, then she should reevaluate if this is even a healthy relationship (the answer there would be no) and whether it's worth it to continue said relationship (also, again, extremely likely no). \n\n**Being passive aggressive instead of assertive is not going to make the husband's behaviour change, and if anything, will actually make it worse.**", "Op should have said that she didn't like/was hurt about how he was mocking her, and maybe tell him to order his own pizza?", "She absolutely should re-evaluate her relationship - he seems awful. And honestly, there was no winning for her here. If she called him out he'd say she \"can't take a joke\". If she orders the meat lovers he makes fun of her again for being ditzy, if she did what she did... we already see the results.\n\nHer husband is a bully, and the best way to deal with a bully is to give as good as you get until their bad behavior becomes so uncomfortable for them that they knock it off.", "Maybe that would\u2019ve worked.
