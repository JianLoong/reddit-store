By that I don't mean we fully cover our bodies, we just don't wear sleeveless tops or pants/shorts that are shorter than knee height. It's just an unwritten rule. No one is forced to adhere to it or criticized if they don't, but everyone (both men and women) do it anyway.\n\nA year ago, my (32m) younger brother (27m) started dating this girl (26f) whose dress sense is completely at odds with my culture. She wears translucent blouses where you can fully see her bra or nipples if she isn't wearing one. She likes to wear ripped jeans where the tears are on her butt so you can literally see her ass cheeks. To top it off, we had a memorial service for one of our relatives who passed away and she showed up in one of those laced up split dresses. I mean why would you dress up like that when you know the people you're going to meet have a modest dress code? But my brother loves her so no one says anything even though a lot of us feel uncomfortable.\n\nMore recently, my wife has been going through a stressful time at work and she's been coping by stress eating so it's not a surprise she's put on a few pounds. We were at my uncle's house for a party when my brother's gf \"jokingly\" passed a comment that my wife needs to get a bigger set of pants for the \"extra pounds\" she's carrying. My wife got teary-eyed because she's been feeling very self-concious about her weight. I told my brother's gf that my wife is fine and to refrain from giving unsolicited comments on her clothes or weight in the future. She then said \"I'm just saying she doesn't look beautiful with such tight clothes.\" That comment pissed me off. I told her my wife is already beautiful and we'll take her opinion into account once she stops dressing like a hooker.\n\nShe went crying to my brother who then got mad and start yelling at me. I told him to fuck off and to teach his gf how to respect other people. Our family is split on this issue. Some have said she had it coming while others believe I shouldn't have stooped down to her level and slut-shaming her.

That's horrible!  \n\nWhat you said was in completely understandable anger and in defense of your wife.  \n\nNTA.  Keep having your wife's back.  I can't even tell you how much she must appreciate you, even if everyone else thinks you were out of line.", "NTA\n\nYou told your brother's GF the truth when she insulted your wife.

Somewhat for her attire at a funeral (ffs) and moreso for how she was rude to your wife in a stupid way. It's one thing (esp in many cultures) to bring up someone's weight, and even that is normally rude. How she worded it is extremely rude, and isn't from a place of care. Also, then she went a step further to double down on it. She was asking to get insulted back. \n\nAlso, people need to learn if they insult your wife, they don't get off scot free.\n\nYou insult my wife?

Even as a child I knew she was being *mad* inappropriate \n\nSecond of all, don\u2019t throw stones from glass houses.

Even if it wasn't see through you would still see her nipples, keep that to your self thank you very much.\nI can see how being anywhere near this girl can make anyone uncomfortable.\nYou told her she dresses up like a hooker because she does!\nAnd who the h*ll goes to a funeral with such a dress? There are dress codes for that kind of event and what she did was absolutely insulting to your family AND to your lost one.", "NTA... Stand by your wife. Personally, I'd have told the bgf that she put on a few pounds, too just to get her worried", "NTA about the comment. That was verbal self defense for all i care.

Clear FAFO to me.", "ESH, and I seriously doubt the way the girlfriend dresses is as extreme as you're trying to paint it. You've made your attitude about her \"immodesty\" abundantly clear, and it seems like you were just waiting for an excuse to say it.", "YTA for the hooker comment. Should have said it in a more tasteful way especially since you were around family. \n\nNTA for standing up for your wife. Standing up for your wife was good, but you should have done it in a more tactful way. Like talking about how you disagree because you think she looks gorgeous in her outfit and how you feel lucky that your wife's personal clothing style matches your family's preferences for modest clothing.

Plus it was pertinent to the insult she gave regarding how someone else dresses.", "Yeah I would\u2019ve said something to her especially if she has her tits out in front of little kids when she has a see through blouse and no bra. That\u2019s so disrespectful", "Well it is one thing to have an opinion (everyone has their own and is fully entitled to one) and another to express it unsolicited.\n\nIMO until OP opened his mouth, he was not the asshole", "Use information only when it has maximum impact.", "[deleted]", "Not that I disagree with you or anything but \n\n\"having her tits out in front of little kids\" made me laugh.
