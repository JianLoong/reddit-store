She needs to accept that there are social norms in place and shouldn't expect to be catered to. Sometimes adults have to do things that make them uncomfortable. Nobody likes wearing \"church clothes\" or the prescribed outfit deemed by the bride at a wedding, but it's what you do. Every adult, barring those with medical reasons, can suck it up for a freaking hour, in support of their loved ones. Adults don't \"whine,\" children do. If she is whining, she is acting like a child and needs to grow TF up. \n\nYou are TAH for being a flying monkey. Stop enabling your mom's admittedly shitty behavior. Your wife takes priority over your mom, and even if you don't agree with her, actively choosing your mom's batshit crazy over her (time and time again, it sounds like) is hurtful. \n\nDo I agree your mom should have been given the option to put on the sweater or go home? Yes. Does your wife get to be pissed that she chose going home over the sweater? Abso-freaking-loutely. \n\nIt seems to me that you've missed the point of your wife's frustration. She's not saying your mom shouldn't have the option to go home - she's pissed your mom won't suck up a basic dress code rule for an HOUR to be present for her grandchild's christening. She views your mom's actions as a CHOICE (which it 100% is) versus something she \"can't\" do. She CAN behave in public, but she WON'T. and that makes your mom the most asshole of the group.\n\nETA for the \"but she sounds autistic, she can't help it!\" Stop. I am on the spectrum, diagnosed in my 30s, with zero childhood support. I have put in the work, purely driven by social ostracism, to learn social norms; she can, too. Autism doesn't change the CHOICE this woman is making to make scenes in public. In any case, I am not convinced she IS diagnosable as anything relevant, and I think it's impossible to armchair diagnose her from a single, secondhand, likely biased account. Narcissists are diagnosable, too, but nobody tries to explain THEIR behavior away \ud83e\udd37", "Good evening MIL troll. \n\nFrom husband perspective so MIL is his mother. \n\n- she has weird habits \n- she whines \n- her 'husband' enables her \n- op is spineless \n- shes hot/dresses sexy \n- op has small kids \n\n\nProbably more I'm too lazy to list but same boring story as usual.", "So I feel conflicted and this might not go well, but NAH. \n\nYou have a great system for dealing with your mom. 10/10, no edits. \n\nUnfortunately, likely because of your mother, you have also I think turned down the emotions on certain things, probably from being let down by your mother so many times. Putting on a sweater or leaving are not two equally valid choices, IF you also want healthy and loving relationships. Your mom puts herself first, and so to survive that you think two decisions are equal, but I mean...not really? Like- will I show up for my mom's birthday or just stay home- is not the same. One means I put myself first no matter the feelings of others, while the other recognizes my mom has feelings and expectations and I value those. \n\nYour wife is mad because your mom is saying she cares more about not wearing a sweater than she does for a major milestone in her grandchild's life. She clearly often makes that decision- her comfort is 100% valued, the feelings and expectations of others do not matter at all- and you are good with that because it is all you know. But, I expect my family to come when they say they will, to be there for the major moments in my life, to sometimes be a little uncomfortable to show up for me. In turn, I do the same for them in big and small ways; big being flying across the country for a wedding or taking a week of work to be there for a new baby, small being I make cookies when I'm tired, or watch a movie I hate because it is his favorite. Sure, my sister didn't come to X because she had to work, and I'm good with that because she shows up other times in other ways. But your mom never does that, and that is why your wife snapped a little. My guess is your wife often has to show up for your mom in ways, but the reverse isn't true. \n\nSo I'm certainly not going to say you are the AH, because I feel bad you had to even create this system to manage your mom, and it is a logical way to deal with it. But I can't call your wife one either, for having to watch this woman embrace her Id at all times while others make themselves uncomfortable for her.", "YTA & so is your mother. One thing that stands out to me is that your mother said she would leave rather than put the sweater on. You said she could leave. But did she leave? No, she hung around whining & soaking up everyone\u2019s attention.  \n\nYour mom did care more about the sweater & having her own way than she cared about participating in a family event, one that appears to have been important to your wife. That\u2019s completely AH behavior. Your way of managing her might be okay if 1) your mom was a stubborn child who was still learning social norms; or 2) you actually followed through in the moment, as in, walking mom to the door and closing it behind her.", "ESH. The christening is a huge deal in your wife\u2019s religion. It was a slap in the face to your wife for your mom to not dress appropriately and then refuse to wear the sweater. With that said people need to stop coddling your mom. You also need to make a rule that you deal with your family and she deals with hers. You also need to give clear instructions to your mom in the future. Also...you ALWAYS stand up for your wife in public. I don\u2019t care if she said the sky is falling and you need to run...you run. When you\u2019ve run to cover and are alone...then address the glaring fact that the sky isn\u2019t falling. I don\u2019t foresee your marriage lasting. You put your mom above your wife. \u201cMom I need you to put a jacket on. This is important for your grandchild and I want you there. I understand you don\u2019t want to wear this but the church won\u2019t let you in without your shoulders covered.\u201d Plain and simple. If your mom isn\u2019t willing to comply then tell her not to come to the reception. Your mom was unreasonable but your wife\u2019s agitation made it worse.", "I'm going to tentatively say ESH.\n\nYou're mom isn't unaware of social norms, she's ignorant of them. You cannot convince me an aging woman found going to any religious event that wasn't her own wedding didn't think bare shoulders would be a bit much if not outright disallowed.  This coupled with the fact that it's part of her personality to the point of wearing down her parents as an adult means she chooses to be difficult. For that, I cannot blame your wife for being annoyed when your mother very intentionally made your child's day about your mother. Your mom stole attention from an actual child, simmer on that for awhile before you get angry at your wife. How many birthdays are we looking at your mom making a commotion going forward? Christmases? Graduations?\n\nYour wife is the AH for exploding at the time she did and the way she did, to be sure, but again I feel for her. You're wife needs to have a conversation about boundaries with you and your MIL, not wait for the last straw to break the camels back however.\n\nAnd you're the AH for thinking you're mom walking away is always acceptable. I see your angle and I'm sure it's saved you a lot of heartbreak, but it's also okay to say \"if you leave, you won't be invited to the next one.\" Give the outcome some permanence.", "ESH.

It\u2019s simple to lay out options and accept the option chosen.", "ESH.\n\nOf course she could leave. Of course your wife made a bigger fight out of this than was needed. Everyone was out of line here. \n\nBut honestly, reading about how your mom reacted (the silly arguing, then the whining, then turning everyone against your wife - INCLUDING you, then that final dig)... I do not actually get autism from this. And I worked in a psychotherapy clinic that did assessments for a long while. While far from an expert, I get the impression of medically defined narcissism, which can have a lot of crossover traits with those on the spectrum. A shallow level reading of it makes people think narcissists have delusions of grandeur and good self esteem, but that's not always or even typically the case; they just as often manifest with the need to generate any attention, good or bad, with an inability to see how their actions impact others and an isolated social circle under their control. For example, a narcissist mother might find opportunities to create conflict where her \"protectors\" step forward and reassert her importance/authority by making sure she gets her way or, conversely, by highlighting her as the \"victim\". This person might also compulsively make choices to emphasize their percieved difficulties. It can get incredibly complex but is inevitably manipulative and exhausting. And these people often create ripples of toxicity that will inevitably rock your family, and your child's, boat.\n\nMaybe it's not that. Could be anything. But either way, your actions don't make you the AH. Letting her leave is entirely appropriate and rational. It's the *framing*. You made it seem like your wife's anger was displaced (it wasn't) in how you extended that solution and didn't validate her feelings in front of people. Saying \"what do you expect me to do, force her?\" misses the point entirely.\n\nYour wife wants to know the next time your mom skips your kid's birthday or makes a scene there, you're not going to shrug it off. She wants you to not force her to accept the passive route of \"this is fine\". She wants the bare minimum of you acknowledging, in front of others who were yelling at and judging HER, \"yeah, this is effed up and not acceptable and you are right to be upset - she's not worth the fight today, but I promise we will talk about this.\" And then! Do that!

Your wife was being overly controlling and escalating the situation.

People wear tasteful strapless dresses to weddings at churches all the time, so she probably didn\u2019t realize she was doing anything taboo.

Giving her the option to leave and come back after the issue that is triggering a meltdown is over gives mom the chance to remove herself from whatever the real problem is, whether it's the sweater being itchy or the confrontation causing anxiety or being in a crowd in a new place being uncomfortable, without making her feel left out or singled out for being overwhelmed by whatever stimulation is causing the problems. \n\nWhy was it so necessary to the wife that the mom be there when it's so clear the wife doesn't like her?

All the kid needed was a referral to a gastroenterologist. \n\nI am sorry this is such a long conversation but I feel people are judging you and your mom and not understanding what your family has gone through and been put up against.
