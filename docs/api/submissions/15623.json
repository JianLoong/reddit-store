We're both in our early thirties and things have been going really well for us - or they were, until about six months ago. My husband had an accident at work that left one of his legs badly broken and he's been struggling ever since.\n\nWe were advised that the road to recovery would be tough and would require surgery and physio. As a result, my husband was forced onto bedrest for several weeks while we waited for his leg to heal. While he was on bedrest, he started snacking more throughout the day and ordering takeout, for convenience sake - he ended up gaining a lot of weight in a relatively short amount of time, because he couldn't exercise or move around at all.\n\nThis genuinely didn't bother me, but I know that he found it very upsetting. His job is quite physically demanding, so he was used to eating whatever he wanted and being able to work it off with no problem. To make matters worse, his family are the kind of people who really look down on those who are overweight - his younger sister especially. She's incredibly superficial.\n\nWe eventually got him into physio, back on his feet, which was a huge win for him. But he still needed a lot of rest and could only move around on crutches, so he continued to put on weight. Then his younger sister announced her engagement and said that she was aiming to get married before the end of 2023. She jokingly teased my husband that he would have to lose the weight before then, to look good for the wedding photos. Quite frankly, I wanted to bawl her out of it there and then but my husband just brushed it off good-naturedly.\n\nOver the last few weeks, though, I've noticed a change in his eating habits. I'm out at work for most of the day while he's been working from home, but the usual food wrappers have been missing from the trash. I started to develop a suspicion that he might be skipping meals, because things weren't adding up - I asked him about it and he admitted that he had been skipping lunch most days. Apparently his sister had actually called him up after announcing her engagement and basically ordered him to \"trim down\" ahead of her wedding or else he'd be left out of the family photos.\n\nI'm not proud of it, but I saw red pretty much immediately. I called her up and gave her a piece of my mind, berating her for essentially putting him on a diet. She gave as good as she got and accused me of enabling unhealthy habits in my husband. After I hung up, my husband was very upset and told me that I didn't need to wade into his family issues like that, and that his sister was right about him needing to lose weight. To make things worse, his mother then called him and bawled him out of it for allowing me to upset his sister.\n\nAm I the AH here? I don't know if I should have involved myself in what was ultimately a matter between him (a grown man) and his sister.", "created_utc": 1682370184, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12xwdx0/aita_for_yelling_at_my_sil_over_her_treatment_of/", "score": 157, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Better course of action is to talk to his medical team and get advice on proper nutrition, along with the PT.  \n\nThe sister and the mother need to lay off him, but you and your husband need to work out how to solve that one. \n\nNTA", "I\u2019m always for people standing up for their partners against family. Seems to be pretty common unfortunately. And it sucks that your husband can\u2019t see that the SIL is horrible. While you may have been hasty, I get it. That doesn\u2019t deserve the title so extreme as \u201casshole.\u201d So NTA from me. But when things cool down, please talk to your husband. He really has to understand that he doesn\u2019t deserve that treatment especially from family and ESPECIALLY after a horrible sudden accident.", "I have mixed feelings about this. I 100% understand why you were upset by this and I probably would've reacted similarly in all honesty.\n\nBut I also agree with your husband, that you shouldn't involve yourself in his family issues if he doesn't ask you to.\n\nI'm going to say NTA because I do think your reaction is justified.", "ESH, he's an adult and if he felt that his sister was out of line he could have said something himself. You come across more as a mother than a partner in the way you speak about him.", "Yeah so gaining weight with a broken leg is bad. Eating unhealthy while your body is healing is bad. YTA.. you should have figured out healthy lunches so he could heal faster and not increase risks. He got fat. He got called out on it. He took it to a extreme and stay out of his family issue", "YTA though I know your heart was in the right place. Let your husband decide how much and when he needs to eat with his reduced activity. If he wants to diet and he's being healthy about it, he can and should diet. Not everyone needs three full meals a day. \n\nIf you're worried that his sister is pushing him towards unhealthy (non)eating, talk to HIM about it and assure him that you have no problem with his size but fully support him.", "YTA. Don\u2019t start an argument with your spouse\u2019s family without consulting your spouse first. Yeah your SIL was being an AH but your husband was actually using that as motivation to lose weight.

YTA.", "YTA, not for trying to support your husband (in your way) but HOW you did it. He clearly wasn't ok with you \"championing\" him, he could've spoken for himself, and he clearly had decided what he was going to do, which is reduce his eating. Whether you agreed or not, it was his choice.", "YTA:  Simply because in that moment instead of talking to your husband you went to defend him...but he didn't want you too and he actually agreed with his sister. \n\nWhat you took as insulting he took as motivation.  That just may be him and his sister relationship", "ESH - It sounds like the SIL was criticizing his weight for purely selfish reasons, but that isn't an invitation for you to jump in, especially without speaking to your husband first.", "NTA - SIL has no idea of the trials, heartaches and joys of marriage. Your husband (and you) had your life turned upside down from medical issues that takes time to progress. Her overbearing comments on his weight and excluding him from family pics crossed the line. She was demeaning to your husband; the man you love. I hope he can center himself and see you were the only person who stuck up for him. Her treatment was not loving. You two hold different opinions on when either can 'step in' on family matters. Clarify this and thrive.", "Mostly NTA. Even calling the sister I think is ok, just what you said sounds a bit too much. She could maybe have been reasoned with you had been calm in your approach, but when you start off with guns blazing people tend to shut down and go into defense mode. It would probably be a good idea for your husband to watch how many calories he's eating and start getting back on the right track. And she should probably be a little kinder in how she addressed it, but siblings often have a different dynamic.", "YTA. That should have been a conversation between you and your husband not you and SIL.", "First of all you should absolutely be proud of it. That's what she deserved to hear. Men shouldn't have to deal with comments about their weight any more than women. Something serious happened to your husband and he's still recovering.

His sister is an AH, you are an AH for causing problems with her.... there's no way you could have possibly that that one phone call was going to make his superficial sister go \"oh ok, I feel horrible for fat shaming\" and then his mommy called him to ball him out for not controlling him? Like what, his dad can control her?  \n\nLord have mercy you all suck so bad.   This poor man is just trying to heal.", "NTA\n\nYou and your husband shouldn\u2019t bother going to the wedding.

He admitted to cutting calories for weight loss. Eating two meals a day is not enough.", "NTA, not at all.\n\nYoure a legend. You step up for people who cant. If he could, he wouldnt be such a coward and follow his little sisters demands, that kinda behaviour only makes her more spoiled than she alr is.\n\nYou can comment on this if you still doubt whether or not youre wrong, but youre not.\nThe family you married just sucks:)", "NTA. You sound like a supportive partner and one not willing to take shit from anyone, especially when it comes to your husband. I understand that, but believe me, his family will try their best to make you out to be the asshole. Speaking from experience. They all sound toxic.", "NTA, I\u2019d be concerned about him skipping meals too. He\u2019d probably benefit from some meal prep on the weekends, so he can have stuff ready made for lunch everyday, that he can just heat up. He can eat healthier overall, and may stick to an occasional takeout on weekends. Once he gets to eating better, he\u2019ll start to feel better too, and this will aid in his recovery. I hope he gets to feeling better soon. His sister is a vapid AH. You\u2019re a great partner to him, I\u2019d be pissed if how he looks is all his family cares about too. He\u2019s going through it right now. Instead of bitching about him losing weight, it\u2019d be nice if they came over to visit him with something good for him to eat. That\u2019s how real family supports someone who\u2019s going through a tough time.", "So, your SIL literally told her injured-and-still-recovering brother that he would be EXCLUDED from family photos at the wedding if he didn't lose weight, even though he's still deep in recovery and can't return to his baseline activity level yet? Wow.\n\nThe fact that she felt so entitled that she demanded your husband *starve* himself lest he be banished from her precious photos is  a very special kind of AHness.\n\nNormally I would say that you were an AH for starting a fight with your SO's family... but his sister literally put her wedding and some photos above his health, wellbeing, and recovery. What next? Will she demand he abandon any assistive devices he need at the door as well? Will she refuse him in the photographs if still needs a brace?\n\nNTA. Your yelling match wasn't a good move, but it was but a tiny speck of AHness compared to SIL's behavior.", "Nta. It's good that you stick up for your husband. I personally can understand what he's going through. I work a labour intensive job and I busted my arm last year and need surgery and had 6 months off work. I went from being really active to nothing and I put on 14kgs as a result. If your husband wants to lose the weight have him talk with his care team and work out a safe and healthy way to shed some kgs. Skipping meals isn't good.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm sure he's glad you have his back even if he has to deal with the fall out.", "If your husband is putting on weight then he is eating more than he needs so eating less and skipping a few meals is not the worse thing to do.

I've worked in the realm of food/diet for several years now and it is definitely possible to lose weight healthily while eating three balanced meals each day.

I understand what you're saying, but he is already motivated to lose weight - it's just a matter of poor timing. He shouldn't really be trying to cut his calories until he has fully recovered.

Why are you so upset at his sister?", "[removed]", "Yes, but deliberately eating in a caloric deficit when you are recovering from a serious injury will do more harm than good - I'm not saying that he couldn't have been eating healthier foods, I'm saying that not eating anything at all is even worse for you than pizza when your body is undergoing strenuous recovery.  \n\n\n>YTA, as you should\u2019ve talked to him about his goals.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by this?", "No but the fact that he\u2019s gaining weight means the food has nutrients! /s", "I'm a dietitian and I have supervised plenty of people's dietary requirements through convalescence, but thanks for your vote of confidence. Eating adequate calories is essential to recovery, and complete bedrest (as is the case here) almost invariably results in some level of weight gain, as the body is suddenly at rest for almost all of the day.\n\nCotton candy contains carbohydrates, which are a nutrient. Is it the healthiest form of carbohydrate? Of course not. Is it slow-releasing? Does it contain gut-healthy fibre? No. But it's still a carbohydrate, which is a nutrient.\n\nFast food generally contains higher levels of saturated fat and processed carbohydrates, which are not typically the healthiest form of these nutrients that we would recommend. But they are nutrients nonetheless.\n\nAny nutrients at all (healthy or otherwise) will always be better for a recovering body than not enough nutrients.", "Sorry, I missed this when it came in!\n\nWe eat breakfast and dinner together, but he has admitted to me that he has deliberately been skipping lunch in order to cut a large number of calories from his diet. This isn't beneficial for someone who is recovering from a serious injury. I have no problem with him eating less fast food - but he is not getting enough calories from his daily intake, because he's skipping an entire meal every day.\n\nI get what you're saying and if I hadn't been there, I might have brushed it off as joking around too - but I've known his sister for almost ten years and I have borne witness to how selfish she can be. He told me himself that she was deadly serious when she called him afterwards and told him to lose weight. I love her, but she unbelievably superficial - to an almost comical degree at times.\n\nI've also seen how hard this entire ordeal has been on my husband. It has been devastating for him, he may never recover the full use of his leg. The last thing he needs in the middle of physio and doctors appointments is someone tapping him on the shoulder and saying, \"I need you to look a very specific way or you won't be in my wedding photos.\"", "He could very well be getting the amount of calories that he needs from his breakfast and dinner. I agree he needs nutrients to recover, but he\u2019s gained a bunch of weight that he needs to lose as well. \n\nYou said in your original post he\u2019s upset about his weight gain and doesn\u2019t feel like himself, etc. You\u2019ve been mad at SIL since she said something to your husband (who brushed it off) and just used his dieting as a way to finally yell at her for it. You didn\u2019t want her to apologize or realize maybe she hurt your husband\u2019s feelings. You just wanted to yell at her bc it was \u201ccathartic\u201d to you. Is there something else going on between you guys?", "He does want to lose the extra weight. But he's a young man in his thirties and he has plenty of time to do that once he's fully recovered, which is the healthiest way for him to go about it. There is a reasonable timeline in which you can expect these things to happen, and it doesn't have to happen overnight or immediately. It is okay to say, \"One step at a time.\"\n\nRegarding my SIL - I feel like no matter what I say, you'll find a way to paint me as petty and vindictive. Including taking my previous comments out of context (yes, I said that it was \"cathartic\" for me to vent my anger at her, but you also conveniently left out the rest of that comment, where I admitted I was wrong for placing my own feelings above my husband's).\n\nWhat I *will* say is this - I love my husband dearly and all I have done over the last six months is support him through his recovery, both physically and mentally. What his sister said to him was deeply unkind, especially given everything he has been through over the past six months. I shouldn't have lost my temper with her or called her before discussing it with my husband, but she should never have placed that kind of pressure on him for the sake of looking good in wedding photos. I feel that if she really cared about him and his recovery, she would be understanding and accept him as he is, regardless of where he is in his journey to recovery.", "YTA - and come off as far more controlling than the sister. In fact, you would prefer your husband eat garbage and be unhealthy and overweight if it means your authority as a diet guru isn\u2019t being challenged. Your notions on health are terrifying really.", "Your husband is wrong you are his family and if someone disrespects him it\u2019s your job to stand up for him when he won\u2019t do it for himself..", "because you care about him, you are his wife, you want to help him, and you're a freaking dietician! are those not enough reasons?\n\nif your husband is skipping one meal a day so that he can continue to eat garbage food for other meals he's doing it wrong and YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT. i think you're having a difficult time separating your SIL's actions with your husband's actions. yes, she is most definitely AH, and a shallow one at that. but that has nothing to do with the fact that your husband is obviously struggling with how/what he should be eating for his own health & recovery. gaining a significant amount of weight in a relatively short time is in no way helpful under any circumstances, and will without a doubt have a negative effect on his ability to do PT to rehabilitate his leg.\n\ni get that you have had to take on additional tasks around your home and i know that being a caregiver can be exhausting, but don't you think you owe it to him to help him figure this out?", "While he shouldn't be losing weight while he is healing, it also isn't healthy for him to be continuing to be gaining weight as that will make it hard to do PT. He should be cutting back some so that he maintains his weight.", ">I meant more in the sense of weight loss, that will have to wait a little while.\n\nWhy?", "Is that what his doctors say, or what you believe? I could be wrong, but it seems like being severely overweight/obese could actually be detrimental to his recovery.", "Because his mobility is still limited due to his injury. Which im inferring from the mention of surgery and ongoing physio.\n\nNot a ton of \"healthy active\" things you can do while recovering and in pain. Pushing things too fast can mean things heal incorrectly, reinjury, and permanent damage. Its well worth it to go at the direction of a professional, like the physio mentioned in OPs post."]}
