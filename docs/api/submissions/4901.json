{"id": 4901, "submission_id": "znomfh", "title": "AITA For telling my wife she was wrong to file a complaint about a teacher with no proof of wrongdoing other than her gut feeling?", "selftext": " My wife (34F) and I (36M) have been married for 8 years and have 2 kids (6M & 3F). Our youngest attends daycare during the day since both my wife and I work. She recently moved into a different preschool room and shortly after she moved, they got a new teacher in that room. Nothing odd about that, there's a lot of turnover in childcare. But it did raise some eyebrows because this new teacher happened to be a man. The only man who worked there.\n\nHe's about our age, maybe a bit older, and seems like a nice guy. I do pretty much all the drop-off and pick-up for our daughter, so I spent some time getting to know him. He used to be a teacher but the school he worked at closed down due to lack of funding. He has 2 kids of his own and his youngest attends the daycare so he figured this would be an easy job while he looks for other teaching options since his son goes there anyway.\n\nMy wife picked our daughter up one day because I was busy and when she got home she immediately told me that something was wrong with our daughter's new teacher. She said that she knew right away that something isn't right about him because of the way he interacts with the kids and her \"mother's intuition\" sent up red flags right away.\n\nI asked her for specifics because I had never seen him interact with the kids any differently than any of the other female employees there. I mean, it's a preschool room, there's going to be tenderness and hugs, that's part of their job. She said she didn't see anything specific, she just got a bad feeling right away and there's always something wrong with a man who wants to be around young kids like that.\n\nShe said she was going to file a complaint with the daycare center to make sure they did a thorough background check on this guy because something seemed fishy to her. I told her not to do that because I hadn't seen him do anything that the other teachers aren't doing. She said that \"moms just know these things and I don't trust him around our daughter.\"\n\nLast week, I went to drop off our daughter and she had a different teacher in her room. I asked her where the previous teacher was and she said he quit unexpectedly. I went to talk to the director to ask her about it and she said he quit when they wanted to put him on leave due to an investigation. I asked her what prompted the investigation and she said they had gotten an complaint. I asked if my wife had filed that complaint and she said she can't tell me that but that I should talk with my wife.\n\nWhen I got home I asked my wife if she filed a complaint and she said she did because something just felt off. I told her she cost the guy his job over her gut feeling with no proof. She said that if he was truly innocent then he wouldn't have quit. I told her that maybe he just didn't want to work at a place where people thought he was evil just because he's a man and that she had no right to file a complaint with no proof.", "created_utc": 1671223514, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znomfh/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_was_wrong_to_file_a/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't think it at all justifies the way your wife handled the situation, and I know lots of preschool teachers do it, but imo it's not appropriate, and teachers (of any gender) should see it as an opportunity to teach kids about boundaries (gently of course).\n\nedit: to be clear, it doesn't change my judgment. your wife is still making wild accusations based on sexist tropes. but still, should definitely include this part.", "In my experiences children always reacted so well with male teachers. I had one situation where a mother refused to let her son be with one of our male teachers because in her words \"only men who have perverted thoughts would become preschool teachers\".

It really can foster quite the sense of paranoia.", "You probably want to find out what she really put.\n\nSee my response to that comment about why the center would have had to investigate. Regardless of things like background checks.\n\nOne thing I didn't put there is that, depending on what she claimed, that teacher may have grounds for a civil defamation suit against her.\n\nEven if he left the job voluntarily, he may still be able to meet the standard for real damage having occured. Especially if the situation results in his ability to secure new employment in the field being impared.\n\nHe might not pursue such action because he just wants to put it all behind him.

Unless he (or others) are forcing the kids to sit in their lap when the child doesn't want to, then I could understand but we don't know if that's the case in this situation. But it's a daycare. A lot of the children are going to need to be picked up and held at one point or another. Why is them sitting on their lap different than being held while the person is standing?

Teachers are taught to squat down to get on eye level with a child whether it be for comfort, instruction, or correction.  By this point, you don't want children thinking it's okay to climb on anyone or everyone's lap.  It's fine with family of course.", "Perhaps I am overreacting, I was under the impression that many teachers would gently place the kid down next to their lap when they crawled onto their lap, but maybe that starts more around kindergarten.", "That's fair. I've been reading up on it in the past few minutes because a lot of people seemed to disagree with me and I've seen very divergent views on this topic, even from early childhood educators themselves. I think maybe I'm conflating day care with, say, kindergarten a little too much, and these kids might be too young to begin to set boundaries vis-a-vis touching the teacher (more than a short, occasional hug). I do think that it does become inappropriate eventually as the child ages, however (by inappropriate, I do not mean sexual, to be clear).", "That is a very unfair way to phrase what I said. I am more concerned about children learning that, as they grow older, it will be considered weird to sit on the laps of adults other than their very close family, and thinking that it's a teacher's place to introduce that lesson. However, I've thought about it, and I think day care is probably too early for that lesson.", "> I will admit that my daughter was at first a bit apprehensive just because she had never seen a man in a role like that before.

Let's just say I've been in OP's shoes.", "Hugs, lap sitting, and cuddling are all appropriate in a preschool setting (depending on situational context obviously). The expectation in my experience is that no contact between a child and a teacher is initiated by the *teacher*, but if it is requested by the child the teacher can choose to allow it or set boundaries (depending on their comfort level, the act, etc).", "Preschool teachers are advised to be loving yet appropriate.

In my experience the teachers that allow kids to climb into their laps are generally more caring teachers. Both of my children have had male preschool teachers with zero issues as well.", "I agree that at some point it does become inappropriate. But in a daycare setting I'd say it's appropriate. Also I wouldn't say these kids might be to young to set boundaries. They'll make it clear if they don't want to be held.", " I'm a PreK teacher and we go through training every year on appropriate conduct.  Sadly, having a child sit on your lap is highly discouraged as some predators use this as a grooming technique and we don't want children to routinely let adults take them on their laps.  A child has to be severely upset or injured before I would even consider doing it.  I usually sit them beside me and put my arm around them.  In those rare instances where a child is on my lap, I make sure I am sitting in an area where a camera is directly on me.  \nOP's wife should have just told the director that, though she had never seen anything inappropriate, she was uncomfortable with a teacher taking a child on their lap.  If the school's state minimum standards don't specify whether or not this is okay, it would then be up to the director to consider if this is a policy she/he should consider.  OP\"s wife was very unfair to that gentleman.", "After reading up on it more, it seems like a lot of preschools and day cares ban it, but more for liability purposes (since a lot of them are private entities) than for any actual child development reasons."]}
