Our youngest attends daycare during the day since both my wife and I work. She recently moved into a different preschool room and shortly after she moved, they got a new teacher in that room. Nothing odd about that, there's a lot of turnover in childcare. But it did raise some eyebrows because this new teacher happened to be a man. The only man who worked there.\n\nHe's about our age, maybe a bit older, and seems like a nice guy. I do pretty much all the drop-off and pick-up for our daughter, so I spent some time getting to know him. He used to be a teacher but the school he worked at closed down due to lack of funding. He has 2 kids of his own and his youngest attends the daycare so he figured this would be an easy job while he looks for other teaching options since his son goes there anyway.\n\nMy wife picked our daughter up one day because I was busy and when she got home she immediately told me that something was wrong with our daughter's new teacher. She said that she knew right away that something isn't right about him because of the way he interacts with the kids and her \"mother's intuition\" sent up red flags right away.\n\nI asked her for specifics because I had never seen him interact with the kids any differently than any of the other female employees there. I mean, it's a preschool room, there's going to be tenderness and hugs, that's part of their job. She said she didn't see anything specific, she just got a bad feeling right away and there's always something wrong with a man who wants to be around young kids like that.\n\nShe said she was going to file a complaint with the daycare center to make sure they did a thorough background check on this guy because something seemed fishy to her. I told her not to do that because I hadn't seen him do anything that the other teachers aren't doing. She said that \"moms just know these things and I don't trust him around our daughter.\"\n\nLast week, I went to drop off our daughter and she had a different teacher in her room. I asked her where the previous teacher was and she said he quit unexpectedly. I went to talk to the director to ask her about it and she said he quit when they wanted to put him on leave due to an investigation. I asked her what prompted the investigation and she said they had gotten an complaint. I asked if my wife had filed that complaint and she said she can't tell me that but that I should talk with my wife.\n\nWhen I got home I asked my wife if she filed a complaint and she said she did because something just felt off. I told her she cost the guy his job over her gut feeling with no proof. She said that if he was truly innocent then he wouldn't have quit. I told her that maybe he just didn't want to work at a place where people thought he was evil just because he's a man and that she had no right to file a complaint with no proof.", "created_utc": 1671223514, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znomfh/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_was_wrong_to_file_a/", "score": 822, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And one day your children could be victims (I pray nothing ever happens to your children, but I'm saying this as worse case scenario) and she is not believed because of her previous allegations.\n\nI think you both as parents need to sit down and discuss this in a calm way.", "NTA, your wife clearly overreacted here. Being extra careful around him or his behaviour, asking the daycare if he has been thoroughly investigated or requiring that everyone at daycare stops allowing kids on their laps would have been an appropriate (still odd to me though) reaction to a simple gut feeling.

She would already be the asshole for that alone, even if she didn\u2019t act on it. That\u2019s serious sexist prejudice. She even has the guts to not even feel guilty or doubt herself when she never even saw anything inappropriate and to insist that he wouldn\u2019t quit if she wasn\u2019t right. He quit because he has a family to provide for and can\u2019t afford not being paid plus being shamed over nothing. Poor man, he was just unlucky enough to encounter your wife. I feel for him.

Your wife caused that man not only to lose his job, she has placed a question mark over how and why he quit a position after having it for less than six months. He had every right to be insulted by having his honor and dedication to helping children questioned by an anonymous self-righteous parent.

That is an absolutely terrible statement to make and your wife needs serious help if she truly thinks that way.
