I (24 F) am soon getting married to my fianc\u00e9 (25 M) We sent out the invited s little over 3 months ago, and invited mostly close friends and family., all except for my aunt, let\u2019s call her Linda. Now, to explain the title, when I was 3 years old I went hiking on a trail with my aunt, uncle, sister, and some friends. We stopped by a ledge with beautiful scenery to take pictures, and when my uncle said it was time to move on with the trail, I refused to leave because, well, I was a stubborn 3 year old. My uncle would have to drag me and right the second he would let go, I would rin back for no damn reason at all. Man I was a dumbass. The last time he pulled me, I ran as fast as I could because I was a 3 year old dumbass and fell 20 feet right into the lake below the ledge. The water was deep for me and I started crying in fear and everybody started panicking and trying to find away to get down, but Linda jumped right into the water. She jumped down to make sure I was okay and helped me get to safety. I adored her ever since, but that soon changed a couple years later. Ever since I came out as bisexual, she hasn\u2019t even looked me in the eyes. She was a huge Christian and would call me slurs, mentally abuse me, guilt-trip me with stuff such as \u201cI saved your life and you do this?\u201d, locked me in my room with no bathroom, water, food, or anything, and tried to send me to a gay conversion camp, but nobody approved. She wouldn\u2019t even take care of me when needed. I was only 13. Fast forward now, I was engaged to my boyfriend of 6 years and was over the moon thrilled. We sent out wedding invitations and the word spread around about my weddings, and Linda overheard and saw that she wasn\u2019t invited. When I tell you this woman went BALLISTIC. I read and listened to each and every one of her texts and voicemails of her going on about how I was a disappointment to the family (even though i got into college and not her), how she dreamed about my wedding since I was a baby, and oh yeah, the guilt-tripping! I couldn\u2019t take this anymore and blocked her on everything. My parents and sister were very upset with her and didn\u2019t approve of her behavior at all. We just had our bachelorette party last week, and this woman somehow \u201cinvited\u201d herself to it and had the AUDACITY to bring a gift. I immediately tried to kick her out but she manipulated everyone into letting her stay and ruined my whole evening. Everyone except for my parents, older sister, and family in law are treating me like I ATA.

Try reframing this question as \"AITA for not inviting my aunt who called me slurs, mentally abused me and imprisoned me when I was a child to my wedding?\" and you may feel less conflicted about it.", "NTA NTA NTA NTA\n\nNope nope nope, didn't even need to finish reading it all after the first couple sentences of you explaining how she has treated you before the recent years.\n\nNice that she saved your life back then, but that doesn't give anyone the right to be abusive and not held accountable.", "Whoa, if you read this back to yourself, you totally know you're NTA. Can you afford security at your wedding? Because you may need it (not only for her, but the other relies you're likely to uninvite soon). Yeah, nice she saved you but you don't owe the rest of your life to her. \n\nHope it goes well!", "TLDR- aunt is homophobic Christian who saved op from drowning as a kid, but since showed true \u201cChristian love\u201d  hard NTA", "NTA she was toxic and wanted to continue to be seen as a saint and a hero even after she treated you poorly. Your wedding, your day, your guests.", "NTA. If someone can\u2019t love your for your entire self, they don\u2019t need to be in your life. Her entitlement is astounding. Be bluntly honest with anyone who asks- \u201cif I were marrying a woman she wouldn\u2019t want anything to do with me, and if she can\u2019t accept my whole self, I don\u2019t want anything to do with her.\u201d", "NTA\n\nI suppose she's already said something to the effect of, \"I should have just let you drown when you were three!\" If she hasn't said it, I'm certain she's thought it. \n\nYou do not owe her anything. She has spent way too much time and energy trying to force you to be someone you are not and bullying and abusing you in an attempt to make that happen. Not sure why the rest of your family let her do those things to you, but that's a different issue.\n\nDo not invite her. Make it explicitly clear to everyone involved at the wedding venue (caterer, officiant, ushers, etc.) that if she shows up, she is to be asked to leave immediately. And send her a note or a text or whatever saying quite clearly that she is not welcome and if she shows up uninvited, the police will be called to escort her off the premises. PERIOD. You can have that message delivered by someone else in your family if you do it in writing, which may be a good idea from a legal standpoint. \n\nThis woman will completely ruin your wedding day if given half a chance. You were wise to block her and it sounds as though your family agrees with that action. Now, since she already crashed and ruined your bachelorette party, you need to take very firm, tangible steps to ensure she does not do the same to your wedding day. Good luck and congratulations! I wish you a long and happy union.", "NTA", "NTA at all. Saving someone's life doesn't give them an excuse to be abusive one they grow up. The whole family should have cut her off after she tried to send you to conversion camp. And if she invited herself to the bachelorette party, you should probably inform the venue staff or security about her and make sure she is not allowed on the premises. She will definitely try to sneak into the wedding.", "NTA - although you used the overused word audacity, you need therapy to talk about this past abuse and trauma. It\u2019s not your responsibility to educate her what she did wrong. Now that you\u2019re in a heterosexual relationship, she\u2019s fine with you, but that trauma and bigotry remains. It might be cathartic to tell her what she did when you were 13 was abusive, and it still hurts you. That she still doesn\u2019t accept you, even though you\u2019re in a heterosexual relationship. That\u2019s up to you and it doesn\u2019t sound like you are. It sounds like you still hurt.", "NTA \n\nShe\u2019s gaslighting you and seems like she\u2019s doing the same to your family. That\u2019s amazing that she saved you as a child, but that doesn\u2019t allow her to be a bigot towards you. She sounds very entitled to your life since she saved it. Who care if anyone thinks you\u2019re an asshole for not inviting her, it\u2019s YOUR wedding. It\u2019s literally all about you and your partner\u2019s commitment.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
