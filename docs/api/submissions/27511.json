Now, to explain the title, when I was 3 years old I went hiking on a trail with my aunt, uncle, sister, and some friends. We stopped by a ledge with beautiful scenery to take pictures, and when my uncle said it was time to move on with the trail, I refused to leave because, well, I was a stubborn 3 year old. My uncle would have to drag me and right the second he would let go, I would rin back for no damn reason at all. Man I was a dumbass. The last time he pulled me, I ran as fast as I could because I was a 3 year old dumbass and fell 20 feet right into the lake below the ledge. The water was deep for me and I started crying in fear and everybody started panicking and trying to find away to get down, but Linda jumped right into the water. She jumped down to make sure I was okay and helped me get to safety. I adored her ever since, but that soon changed a couple years later. Ever since I came out as bisexual, she hasn\u2019t even looked me in the eyes. She was a huge Christian and would call me slurs, mentally abuse me, guilt-trip me with stuff such as \u201cI saved your life and you do this?\u201d, locked me in my room with no bathroom, water, food, or anything, and tried to send me to a gay conversion camp, but nobody approved. She wouldn\u2019t even take care of me when needed. I was only 13. Fast forward now, I was engaged to my boyfriend of 6 years and was over the moon thrilled. We sent out wedding invitations and the word spread around about my weddings, and Linda overheard and saw that she wasn\u2019t invited. When I tell you this woman went BALLISTIC. I read and listened to each and every one of her texts and voicemails of her going on about how I was a disappointment to the family (even though i got into college and not her), how she dreamed about my wedding since I was a baby, and oh yeah, the guilt-tripping! I couldn\u2019t take this anymore and blocked her on everything. My parents and sister were very upset with her and didn\u2019t approve of her behavior at all.

Make it explicitly clear to everyone involved at the wedding venue (caterer, officiant, ushers, etc.) that if she shows up, she is to be asked to leave immediately.

You were a tender age child with no awareness of the dangers on a hike.  Your aunt and uncle were RESPONSIBLE for your safety and well being because they were the adults on this hike.  You did what all 3 year olds do, have a tantrum when they are bored or don\u2019t want to do what everyone else is doing.  \n\nThe appropriate parental response is the de escalate the situation by getting down the child\u2019s level, validate their feelings, use a distraction to get them focus on something else, etc, including having one adult stay with the toddler to de escalate the tantrum while the others move on.\n\nYour Uncle was dragging you against your will, escalating the tantrum.  This is absolutely the worst thing to do in a tantrum because the child can get unpredictable and lash out when you use force.  You lashed out and ended up in a dangerous situation.\n\nYou were put in the dangerous situation because your aunt and uncle PUT YOU THERE by not de escalating the tantrum you were having that all 3 yr olds have.  They put you in danger by dragging you along on the hike when you no longer wanted to participate.\n\n3 year olds don\u2019t have the language to fully explain their feelings which is why they have tantrums.  It\u2019s a frustration because they don\u2019t have the words yet to describe their feelings.  Your aunt and uncle for more concerned about forcing you to do what they want than to safely deal with your tantrum.  The behavior you describe of pulling and running are classic behaviors of a toddler upset but without the vocabulary or emotional intelligence yet to verbalize your feelings and problem.\n\nSo, stop praising your aunt for saving you.  She and your uncle put you in the dangerous situation by their lack of parenting skills.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that your aunt is acting the way she is.  She needs to be the center of attention in everything,  she feels she saved your life and you owe her.  She didn\u2019t save your life, she saved her own a**, because if something tragic had happened, she would have been held accountable for failure to appropriately supervise a 3 yr old.\n\nSo, I think you and your family, need to reframe the incident when you were 3.  All parents make mistakes in parenting. We correct the mistake and move on.  Your aunt and uncle have made their parenting 101 - how to handle a toddler tantrum mistake into the aunt is a hero for saving the child.  It deflects from their failure to parent a tender age child that almost led to a tragedy.\n\nSo, no do not invite her to the wedding, she treated you disrespectfully on more occasions than I can count from this post.

She is jumping for a invite as you are marrying a man but if it was the otherway round, a female fiancee, I gurantee she would have said the opposite and not bothered of getting invited. Its your big day so you have a right to decide who to invite. Why would you want to invite the 'aunt' who caused you trauma and was abusive.", "Does the rest of the family know the 'true' Aunt Linda? The pretend Christian who abused and degraded you? If not, I would tell them.\n\nI would also send her gift back and tell her that although you are grateful to her for saving your life as a 3 year old, her subsequent behavior has shown her true colors. Her abuse of you because you were and still are bisexual is something you can not accept or tolerate and therefore she is not invited to your wedding.  Unlike your Bachelorette, there will be security at your wedding and she will not be allowed to enter the venue.\n If the other guests have a problem with that they can leave as well.", "*<She was a huge Christian and would call me slurs, mentally abuse me, guilt-trip me with stuff such as \u201cI saved your life and you do this?\u201d, locked me in my room with no bathroom, water, food, or anything, and tried to send me to a gay conversion camp>*\n\nNTA AT ALL for not inviting her. \n\nIf she shows up uninvited like at your bachelorette's party, make sure you have security with her picture to keep her away.\n\nDon't forget; she only wants to come because you are marrying a man.\n\nYou are bi-sexual.\n\nWhat if the love of your live had been a woman?\n\nAlso, When she \"saved\" your life, you were a three-year-old under their care.  \n**It was their responsibility to keep you safe**, and if they had done a proper job, they wouldn't have had to save you at all.\n\nKeep this toxic person axway from you.", "NTA\n\nFirst, you don't owe her for saving your life. Your parents do. You were three. Three year olds don't incur debts. Tell her that the next time she brings it up\n\nSecond, why would you invite someone to your wedding who doesn't share your happiness?", "Cool story", "NTA. When someone saves your life, it doesn't actually belong to them. This woman abused you. If your family isn't supporting you protecting yourself from your abuser, then I'm sorry to say that they are part of the problem.", "NTA. Your aunt is actually evil. She only saved you to get brownie points with her shitty god.", "It is a good thing the accident happened before you came out.   NTA and congratulations on your upcoming nuptials.", "NTA. She saved your life as a kid. Unlike in fantasy and action movies, this doesn\u2019t mean you owe her your life.\n\nShe\u2019s treating you like shit, she\u2019s being abusive, so that cancels out any merit she got from saving you from drowning. Doing good deeds doesn\u2019t cancel out bad things you do afterwards. If I save someone\u2019s life then kill them 7 years later I\u2019m still going to jail. If I compliment someone on their outfit then 3 days later call them an ugly slob, I\u2019m still an asshole. If I buy a woman dinner, she doesn\u2019t owe me a relationship of any kind just because I was nicer to her than other people. \n\nYour aunt\u2019s a bitch, and you don\u2019t have to have someone who makes you miserable at your wedding because they have some sort of hero complex, or religious superiority complex.", "It also kind of sounds like uncle was being a jerk to a three year old who reacted. So yes, aunt saved this person but her husband created the problem in the first place.", "Exactly this. OP was in their care and they almost died - they were saving their own asses as much as OP.\n\nA three year old is small enough that you can just pick up and carry away if they are being dangerous or stubborn.", "She did what any adult would do. I would jump in to try and save a three year old I didnt know. Doesnt mean that kid owes me anything.", "oh yes i have a wholee plan on that!", "you think i would accept her apology? she wasn\u2019t even invited and still showed up and brought a gift. the gift was chocolates and a CROSS! to \u201chelp me get closer with the Lord\u201d", "Even more baffled.  Why do people downvote questions?\n\n(OP answered and seems to be okay with it - I couldn't possibly have guessed what that \"present\" was).\n\nNTA again.", "\"I saved your life, once, when you were cute and biddable so now I have the right to abuse you as much as I want and ruin your milestone events.\"\n\nNope! Also, don't let her get away with dismissing it as \"well, you're marrying \\~\\*a man\\*\\~ so clearly you're not gay anymore!\" I know *you* know this, but feel free to remind her that being in a committed relationship with someone of the opposite gender doesn't make you any less bisexual.", "She saved your life. That doesn't mean she has any say in how you live it", "She didn\u2019t \u201csave your life\u201d. Her and your uncle were  incredibly negligent for that to happen in the first place. What she did was rectify a situation that she caused by letting a 3 year play by a cliff. Also, NTA.", "This. Yes. They INVITED op on the trip. They should have known what they were getting into. It was an expectation.", ":) wish i could upvote this a million times in support. all the love and best wishes to you and your SO btw :)", "Fucking hell.  That's in a whole different league of bigoted nastiness.\n\nNTA for sure.", "Yep. If the kid keeps running off, you DON'T LET GO OF THEM.", "I hate that OP was conditioned into thinking their aunt was a hero when she really was just trying to save OP from a tragic situation *the aunt and uncle had caused*. OP (as a 3 year old!) shouldn\u2019t have been in that situation in the first place.\n\nNTA, OP. Keep her uninvited.", "you\u2019re so sweet \ud83d\udc9e", "Jumping in was an instinct, years of abuse is premeditated.", "NTA", "Why in god's name would she know about who you like to have sex with? I don't get you people. I bet you even tell children.", "NTA.  She shouldn't expect an invitation when she doesn't even like the way you live your life.", "NTA. And your description of the \"incident\" is disturbing. All toddlers are suicidal maniacs. It's the responsibility of adults to take care of toddlers even when they're stupid. You owe her nothing.\n\nYou were **three**. Your memories and interpretation of what happened have been instilled in you by your aunt and it's just another way to get attention. She's been manipulating you since you were too young to realize what was happening. Stop listening to it. Next time she tells you she saved your life tell her she shouldn't brag about letting a toddler nearly drown under her care. She was supposed to be responsible for you the whole time.\n\nThink how you would react if a three year old under your care was in danger, and whether you would hammer in to them for the rest of their life how you're a hero and they owe you. If you're a half decent person you wouldn't.", "NTA she saved your life only to abuse you later! Horrible!!!  She may have molested you, but you don\u2019t remember.", "NTA, saving your life once does not actually give her power over your life. She's been calling your slurs most of your life and locked you in your room.\n\nIf she was so committed to being at your wedding she should have tried being nice to you over the last decade.", "So let me get this straight: \n\nShe saved your life but treated you like shit once you shared your were bisexual. She was an evil \u201cbible thumper\u201d and wasn\u2019t interested in you until you were marrying a MAN (gasp) and now has the audacity to be upset for not getting an invite\n\nYeah NOT the asshole 1000% the gall of some family members on here has really stopped shocking me atp", "huh? i don\u2019t get this comment", "Better get bouncers for your wedding so she doesn\u2019t crash it", "Whoever is telling her about the events for the wedding, find out who it is and cut them off. Hire security for your wedding and have them keep her out. She could even mess with your reservations and catering. Have everything password protected and alert the venue to not let her in. NTA"]}
