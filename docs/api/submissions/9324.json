Maybe it is time for a new therapist that will actually have some idea of how a household works. What is the therapist going to suggest if your son starts feeling like he needs his own room after you had to give up your bedroom and move in with him? Is the therapist going to say you need to sleep on the couch? Therapy can be the difference between an unhappy life and a happy one, but they don't get to offer the suggestions at the expense of others, in a situation where there really isn't an option to make the change.\n\nAlso, where I live, you can lose shared custody if a 12-year-old girl needs to share a room with a member of the opposite sex.", "NTA. But next time her psychologist suggests something you know you won't be doing, tell them that. Theres no reason for them to talk through something that won't be happening, and she took your silence as you agreeing to it.", "NTA\n\nYou need a new psych doctor because that was the worst suggestion possible.\n\nDoes make me wonder if your daighter suggested this option to her psych doctor and they brought it up when you came assuming you would just agree to it.", "NTA,  would it be possible to corner off part of the garage and make it an office/art/homework space or maybe a small she-shed in the backyard? This way she can have her space without changing rooms.", "Agreed. I'm a child therapist, and this whole thing is setting off my spidey-senses. I'd get a new one immediately", "And definitely report this one. She wants a father to share a bedroom with his pubescent daughter.", "For sure.  In fact, that might even be cause for someone to call CPS on you.  Children over 6 are also not supposed to share a room with the opposite gender, so the arrangement you have now is the only one that will keep you out of trouble.", "The world where this story is made up? I\u2019m increasingly skeptical of them here.", "Good idea, I was thinking a piece of tape down the middle of the room. Cubes or book shelf is even better!", "Omg, EXACTLY!!! I'm stunned with so many responses suggesting he figure a way to cater to this entitled child.Isn't that part of the problem??? \n\nShe shares a room with her sister.  Deal with it.\n\nEdited for typo", "Exactly. The kid needs to learn coping skills and that she does not always get what she wants.", "super creepy for a girl of any age to be sharing a room with a male of any age? Wow, you must have unlimited space and resources.  Me, my twin sister and  our brother shared one bedroom until he was 8yo and we were 6. There was nothing creepy about it. People try to make issues where there are none. Why is everything sexualized? \n My oldest sister had a closet sized room and my parents had their room, which was small. My parents converted a tiny dining room space for my brother's room once he was 8yo becauseat 8 they felt he was old enough to not change/dress in feont of us (and cice versa for us). (my dad used it for his work until then- he worked 3 jobs to provide for us). Mom was sahm until I was 10 and oldest sister was 17 and could watch us after school safely.", "My sons room is a bit bigger than mine, but the girls room is by far the biggest", "He is the parent  and should not share a room with his kid. Dad should have privacy as well.  This girl needs a dose of reality regarding her living situation. She gets her own room when she moves out.", "That's what I was thinking, get one of those room dividers like in office spaces.", "There are cool bunkbed ideas on Pinterest for providing privacy for kids who need to share a room", "I\u2019ve often wondered myself about some of these\u2026. Internet is full of  alternate realities", "Sometimes therapists just suck at their jobs.", "Ah gotcha.", "Key line:  when you visited.  This dad us the kids full time so he'd spend every night on the couch.   Not s reasonable solution. Neither is moving as he stated.", "NTA. What kind of professional would say something like that? It\u2019s a ridiculous suggestion. Besides being absurd, if I pay the bills I get my own room. Period.", "Bro these therapist are getting fucked lately. Have hear so many dumb and honestly hurtful \u201csuggestions\u201d lately it\u2019s crazy", "NTA.   \nHer psychiatrist has done gone lost her mind.", "My sister was 11 years older and we shared even after she was away at college.  Your daughter will live.  But then, I was a perfect child and everyone wanted to share with me. /s", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t see why anybody should change rooms. \nBut, if you are, you and your son should take the biggest room. Give your daughters a small room each.", "Wow she sounds pretty entitled. What a earth would make her think that you would give up your room to her? That\u2019s one of the most ridiculous things I\u2019ve heard in a while. I also think it would highly inappropriate.", "NTA, don\u2019t do that", "I gotta say, that may be the dumbest suggestion I have seen. NTA, find them a new doctor", "Nta. What is wrong with that therapist?", "NTA, and find a new therapist because that one is... not great.", "NTA. You should NOT be sharing a room with your 12 year old daughter!  What was the psych thinking, to suggest that? You may want to report that to the psych licensing agency in your state. \n\nYou may need a new psych for your daughter\u2019s.", "NTA\n\nThere are however very clever and creative ways to divide a room into 2 bedrooms or at least to giving more privacy to each child. I think you could include your daughters in brainstorming ideas on how you could do that.", "I had a similar problem sharing a room with my big sister when she started to get teenager angsty. She demanded I move into the guesthouse. I did not want to, I countered why don\u2019t you move. She didn\u2019t want to either. We ended up just sharing the room until she left for college. F her therapist", "NTA If she won\u2019t stop demanding her own room, move both girls out into the smaller rooms so you and your son can share the large room instead. You can get a room divider curtain that hangs from the ceiling for privacy.", "NTA, likely should have mentioned it sooner then.  But understandable not wanting to bring it up with the psych who clearly is not good at their gig.   Should be reported for that sort of suggestion.\n\nParent ideally shouldn't be in same room as at their ages and mixed genders shouldnt be in the same room.\n\nSo unless OP has a basement room they could convert to a 3rd room no other option really but report the psych.", "It could be the psychologist threw that out there with the thought that it would be so preposterous that even a 13 year old would see that. Obviously it didn\u2019t work. OP should have spoken up at the session when his daughter appeared to be taking it seriously.\n\nA father and a 12 year old daughter shouldn\u2019t be sharing a bedroom. Their set up with the kids is perfectly reasonable. Not all kids get their own individual bedroom. In fact, that opportunity is a fairly recent development in the context of human history. She needs to accept that her own room isn\u2019t happening until she\u2019s an adult.\n\nThere are other ways for her to have privacy at times. Talk to the counselor for ideas. The bedroom situation isn\u2019t going to happen. The therapist also needs to apologize.\n\nOP is NTA.", "This.  NTA, and a better suggestion would be some kind of hobby that took her out of the house.", "Get a new one.", "Can you imagine when the 12f want her own room in one year? What teenager want to share her room with her dad? This therapist is wack", "I 100% agree with you. This will make her even more entitled than she already is.", "Therapist suggested dad share with the 12 year old girl.  Son is 9.", "Best solution is for the daughter to stop being entitled and accept that she has to share a room with her sister.", "All teens want their own space. You don\u2019t have enough bedrooms for all 3 to have their own room.", "I can just imagine OP having a visit from CPS/the police, with them thinking he\u2019s assaulting the 12 year-old.", "When I was fostering my now adopted kids, they were sharing 1 room. CPS, who had custody of kids and arranged their foster and adoption with me, told me that sharing would be fine until the twins turned 6. The boy twin would have to be moved into his own room at that time.", "No. Siblings of the same gender share bedrooms all of the time. CPS could be called if OP was sharing with the 12 year old\u2026.and maybe even the 9 year old boy. His sharing with his daughters isn\u2019t an option. \n\nThe therapist would know that,which is why I think the suggestion was meant to help the girl come to the realization on her own. Obviously it backfired.", "The daughter just needs to accept her living situation and figure out a way to make it work."]}
