No idea what the therapist was thinking there, but she needa a new one. I wonder if there was some ethics violation there; check with your local governing body for medical ethics, as therapy usually falls under medical care.

I agree it's not appropriate for you and your daughter to share a room as a permanent solution. It's unfortunate that the sisters can't get along and that the oldest is unhappy with their living situation but she and the therapist need to understand that that is the living situation you have to work with and moving is not an option.

What kind of quack suggests that a father share a room with his 12 year old child?

Room dividers and curtains could work. Noise cancelling headphones are great.", "NTA\n\nI seriously question a psychologist who suggests that the solution to a child having emotional issues is to have her sibling move into the parent's room.\n\nThat would be insane even if it were same sex but so completely inappropriate for a teenager girl to share a bedroom with her father.\n\nIt is absolutely appropriate for two teenage girls who are approximately the same age to share a bedroom in these circumstances. Sharing a room isn't a major trauma that needs to be remedied.\n\nWhy not do something in terms of decoration that delineates the spaces more - wall divider - curtain. Letting each one purchase decorating stuff that is to their specific taste.", "I can't even believe this is true.", "NTA but your daughters therapist is crazy.", "NTA. What kind of psychologist would even SUGGEST that a Father share a room with a 12 year old Daughter?! That is messed up. The solution is NOT swapping bedrooms.

Can the room be modified to provide more privacy for each girl?\nAnyway, you sharing with a 12 years old is a big no-no and might end up in a sticky situation for you.\n12f and 9m sharing will be a nightmare as 9m will be to immature and 12f is entering a difficult time and will not be comfortable sharing with a boy.\nMaybe discuss as a family and try to see how it could be solved.", "This.

Really ?  Not only get a new one but report this one..", "Ick no!", "If the girls are in the master bedroom, it'd make more sense to partition it versus suggesting OP share a room with his 12 year old daughter.

Almost everyone has had an annoying sibling the solution is to work on making them closer and giving them more defined personal space (such as putting a divider in the room or making very clear that this is x\u2019s desk and this is y\u2019s desk or something).", "4.  Daughter looks into dorms (unless her rough time at school included leaving school)", "Will CPS really get involved because a 12 year old and 13 year old of the same gender share a room?", "I think your recommendation is highly inappropriate as well.

That is crazy.", "No the father should not be sharing a room with anyone unless it is a child under 5 (and even that's stretching it).", "Yeah I think giving her her own space where possible is the best solution.

The psychologist is the problem here. \n\nAnd share a room with his son?? So just screw the son over and take away his privacy while spoiling the daughter.

Maybe he needed time to gather his thoughts in private, even if only to make sure he wasn't going insane.\n\nNTA", "Not creepy. I\u2019m sick of that word being overused.
