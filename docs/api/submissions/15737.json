That isn\u2019t true - while she was paying her own rent, she was kind of just staying over at my house, but when she formally moved in, I brought up that once we are married she\u2019ll have to kick in. I think she thought it was a joke and we never really \u201chad it out\u201d until now, but it wasn\u2019t sprung on her per se.\n\nEDIT 2: People keep assuming we have a prenup, which we do, but it\u2019s very generous to her. Basically, as long as we don\u2019t have an acrimonious divorce, she gets everything in the event of my death and 40% of all of my wealth if we get amicably divorced and we have children. So yes she would get some of the house even if we are divorced assuming it isn\u2019t acrimonious.\n\nEDIT 3: I would put her on the deed but my parents won\u2019t allow it.
