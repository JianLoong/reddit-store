If you love the name Emily (which I do too!), so be it.  Sounds like your friend may even no longer be attached to that name if neither of her twins got it.  Better to let her know your decision now though than at birth as this is what good friends discuss and that just seems more natural and honest to me.", "NTA.", "Lmao I would definitely not be friends with some one like this.

Did you badger her about the names she picked.", "NTA. People trying to claim names are annoying.", "Right? There are so many of them anymore. All of these parents just seem exhausting. I think that's also why you also get so many ridiculous names now because all of these idiots just have to show that their little angel is the best and so much more special than all other kids.\nEdited: repeated word", "The name isn't actually Emily it's just what I used as an example. On the off chance she sees this (which is extremely unlikely)", "She has 4 kids now, I hope she is done if she has difficulty with conceiving. (Unless she has unlimited funds). Gatekeeping a name is silly, especially if you already have four kids, including at least two girls, and didn't use the name. Use the name you love. If you lose her friendship over it, was she really your friend?", "holy based", "YES!!!! I wouldn't care if she named her kid the same name whatsoever. Especially considering half the time you give your kids nicknames anyway.", "I find it hard to believe that the name is the real problem here but I can\u2019t imagine what her problem is.", "Ok.  But there\u2019s nothing wrong with both your child and the possibility of a future child of hers having the same name.", "People are that petty", "NTA. She had TWIN GIRLS and didn't use it! It's more than fair game now.", "Name your baby what you want, and tell your friend the Name Claiming Department is closed.", "NTA.  More insufferable people.  Claim a baby name\u2026. For the love.", "NTA at all. However, you can be right and still lose a friend. If she\u2019s upset enough that she distances herself from you, are you okay with that?\n\nMany people would be okay losing the friendship, since that says a lot about her and what she values in a friendship. I personally don\u2019t think she\u2019s being a great friend to you here and in your shoes I would have already distanced myself the second she tried to call dibs on a name without compelling reasons (an example of a compelling reason would be if it were her grandmother\u2019s). But you may want to consider whether the name or even the principal of the thing (nobody owns a name) is worth it to you since you are close. If you do use the name, you can\u2019t avoid the argument indefinitely. You already know she\u2019s going to be upset. She already suspects you\u2019re not telling her everything (hence the asking daily). The longer you put this off the bigger chance that this will be the end of the friendship. \n\nThere is another aspect to this too. While you don\u2019t owe her any info, you are already deliberately lying to her when saying you don\u2019t know. Even if she didn\u2019t care about the name at this point, that\u2019s going to impact trust between you and the person you talk to daily. Whether you see it that way or not, you\u2019re currently lying to your friend to try to avoid an unavoidable conflict. So if you do hope to both use the name and attempt to salvage the friendship you should probably either tell her you aren\u2019t sharing the name until birth, tell her you\u2019re waiting until you know the gender to decide, or tell her you plan to use that name and deal with the fallout. She\u2019s going to realize, as soon as you announced the name, just how many times you were lying when you told her you didn\u2019t know. \n\nShe\u2019s not great for trying to claim the name, but if you rob her of the opportunity to talk it out, you should fully expect her to decide you\u2019re untrustworthy. Most people don\u2019t talk to people they can\u2019t trust daily.\n\nIn other words, neither of you are being great friends to each other right now. \n\nAgain, you\u2019re not in the wrong. But you should probably decide if you want to stay friends with her or not and, if you do, what lengths you are and are not willing to go to to try to maintain the friendship. At the very least, if the goal is to stay her friend, you should probably tell her you are considering this name at the point you actually know for sure you\u2019ll be using it (so once you know the gender). If you don\u2019t trust her to react to that appropriately, it\u2019s probably time to consider why you\u2019re even maintaining a close friendship with this person.", "NTA . What is she 4 ? You can't call dibs on baby names . Name your kid whatever you like .", "She had *twins*, both girls after \"claiming\" a girl's name. Then she doesn't use it. Four girl's names, yet not one of them is the one she \"claimed.\" NTA. Even if claiming a name was possible, she forfeited her hypothetical rights to it by taking a pass *four times*! If she makes a fuss, that's your cue the friendship has run its course.", "NTA...there are a MILLION Emily's in the world. Wtf is wrong with that??? Name her Emily! (Edit:fixed typo)", "Aside from the fact that no one owns a damn name, she had her girls, ie her chance to use the name and didn't. She gave up her own ridiculous dibs.  Use the name lol NTA", "NTA. She had two daughters, two chances to use the name. \n\nThat isn't on you.\n\nAlso, I hope she is aware, that more than one person in the world can have the a particular name as part of their name?", "NTA\nBut I wonder if she actually liked the name at all as she didn't use it when she had the chance...\n\nName your baby what you want and tell people after the birth only, if she says anything claim ignorance, I don't remember you saying that, when did you say that, but you didn't use it etc", "I mean if friend gets pissy about it OP can be like \u201cI assumed you were not that attached to it given you didn\u2019t name any of your four children that name\u2026\u201d", "I'll do it when I find out gender, if it's a girl. \ud83d\ude0a No point in having an argument that has no real point.", "Emily was just an example name, but that IS a beautiful name!", "She just is very emotional bc she has a very stressful life and never sleeps or gets a break. I don't need to benefit anything to be a good friend. She needs someone and I love her and want to see her thrive. \nEven if she was done with our friendship over this I'd assume thats just God's plan and keep going. I am blessed with lots of people who love and support me. If she isn't one of them, so be it. \n\nHowever I wanted to sure I wasn't being selfish.", "I love my friend I truly do. But I don't find the loss of friendship, if it happens, to be my fault unless I was in the wrong.", "She is not done. But that is her dream family, all of our ideas of the perfect family are different. To each their own. \ud83d\ude0a", "It actually truly IS the problem. Hence the post. She's a very emotional person. She has a lot going on. She expressed her feelings about this topic to me and I simply was making sure I'm NTA for continuing to use the name despite it. We have great communication. Although I don't understand why a name matters Im glad she could be upfront instead of hiding behind a passhole attitude."]}
