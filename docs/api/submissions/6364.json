Ask them to think of how these \u2018jokes\u2019 made your fianc\u00e9 feel - did he feel welcomed? Valued as a member of the family? No, he probably felt awkward and uncomfortable and wondered who on earth these people were.  Likewise you were likely embarrassed and mortified their behaviour - had they even considered that if your fianc\u00e9 was a weaker man they could have completely undermined your relationship? No. \n\nPersonally I\u2019d write to them and say they left you with no choice but to leave, and that their actions caused this and ruined Christmas. If they mention the children, ask why it was appropriate for kids to be aware of his finances financials. Let them know how disappointed you were after looking forward to coming home for such a long time. Try not to be overly accusatory, or they will play the victim card, and do not get bogged down in the detail or individual circumstances, which can get personal, just express your disappointment and how upset you were by their behaviour. \n\nIt is difficult to argue with someone who is reasonable and \u2018disappointed\u2019 in your behaviour.
