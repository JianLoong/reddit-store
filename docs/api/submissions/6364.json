Was that from you?", "INFO: did your family know your fiance would buy them expensive things? Or did they just assume? Because mentioning (subtly or not-so-subtly) what you want for Christmas in what happens to be the wrong price range isn't inherently bad. Is it possibly they just badly misjudged your fiance's generosity?", "NTA", "I would have done the same.  The nerve of them!  How have you been having a weekly family dinner with your family while you;ve been out of country? Or did I misunderstand your post?", "NTA. The really crossed the limits. Happy you stood out for him.", "NTA. Made the right decision to stick up for your fiance. Good on you!", "NTA. I'm sorry your family acted so horrible.  Seeing that you now live in a different country I'd say just keep your distance for the most part. Acknowledge them on holidays and birthdays with a simple call or card sent but yeah...", "\u2018Jokes\u2019 about peoples financials are never appropriate, full stop.\n\nPlease let your family know that \u2018just joking\u2019 is the excuse that every bully or passive aggressive person has used every time they get called out. Ask them to think of how these \u2018jokes\u2019 made your fianc\u00e9 feel - did he feel welcomed? Valued as a member of the family? No, he probably felt awkward and uncomfortable and wondered who on earth these people were.  Likewise you were likely embarrassed and mortified their behaviour - had they even considered that if your fianc\u00e9 was a weaker man they could have completely undermined your relationship? No. \n\nPersonally I\u2019d write to them and say they left you with no choice but to leave, and that their actions caused this and ruined Christmas. If they mention the children, ask why it was appropriate for kids to be aware of his finances financials. Let them know how disappointed you were after looking forward to coming home for such a long time. Try not to be overly accusatory, or they will play the victim card, and do not get bogged down in the detail or individual circumstances, which can get personal, just express your disappointment and how upset you were by their behaviour. \n\nIt is difficult to argue with someone who is reasonable and \u2018disappointed\u2019 in your behaviour. However, if you start throwing shite, guaranteed they will throw it back. \n\nI would suggest you try to see them all prior to the wedding (perhaps without your fianc\u00e9) if they respond positively, to clear the air. \n\nGood luck x", "Hard NTA. Your family is greedy and entitled, and only sees your fiance as a meal ticket. They were very rude and out of place to keep importuning your fiance to buy them expensive, top-of-the-line things, especially when they just met him. His finances are nobody's business but his own. Block your family who is giving you grief, and move on from them.", "Let's see... of the names they called you,\n\n'Selfish?'\n\nUh...you didn't skip out on the weekly family dinner by making plans with your fianc\u00e9 to go someplace else?\n\n'Entitled?'\n\nYou weren't the one flagrantly putting out there in the open that you expect designer / branded items for Christmas?\n\n'Gold-digger?'\n\nDidn't you say it was your fianc\u00e9 who proposed to you? \n\n\nAn asshole you are not. Your family ruined Christmas for everyone when they realized they aren't getting the perks they expect to get by virtue of having a rich in-law. When you clarified this with them and the revelation started materializing in their heads, that's when things fell apart. And in the midst of the shitstorm, you had the utmost misfortune to endure their endless projecting, incessant gaslighting and infantile name-calling. Even if you put up with them this one time, eventually down the line at some point you're going to have to ask yourself where's your breaking point?\n\nAnd fortunately enough for you, you found out quick enough.\n\n(Edit: How does one joke about calling somebody else a 'gold-digger'? What realm of utter horse shyte could this possibly have emanated from?)", "NTA. You should go low contact with them tbh", "NTA \nYour family came across as grasping and desperate and not as joking at all. I feel second hand shame for them even if they are too shallow to feel it themselves. \n\nYou did nothing wrong. Tell your fianc\u00e9 you need to handle your family. He shouldn\u2019t feel he needs to buy them over.", "Soo...\n\nI'm not trying to get downvoted here but this is a little strange.\n\nFirst off, how does your family know just how rich this guy is? I know rich people but I don't know if they can buy Escalades and houses for Christmas presents. Did you actually tell them he's a multimillionaire over the phone? Was this a major topic of conversation? If you were driving the point home too hard, maybe your family was making a joke at *your* expense. I don't know.\n\nBecause your family's behavior is like nothing I've ever heard. It was obviously a joke because grown  people were talking about Santa. You'd have to be from another planet to think this wasn't super tacky, rude, off-putting, inhospitable... They clearly decided to pull a full-family joke. No one thinks their nephew's fiance is buying them an SUV for Christmas. No matter how rich he is.\n\nYou're NTA for putting your foot down because they're still being disgusting. But to assume they were being \"serious\" is just dumb", "NTA Congratulations on finding love and safety away from that grasping family.", "NTA", "It sounds like YTA unless your fiance is multimillionaire. I wouldn't assume someone talking about their dream home, a new car etc. expected someone to buy it as a Christmas present.\n\nYou know your family more than me so perhaps they really were making not so subtle request. From my point of view, it looks as though you snapped at the opportunity to make the occasion about yourself and drive home the fact that your fiance is loaded.", "NTA; what has his money got to do with your family?  If anything, I\u2019d be a bit embarrassed about what I could get him for a gift, given the apparent disparity in purchase power.", "NTA at ALL, OP. And good for you for having your fianc\u00e9e's back on this. He tried to do something nice for the people in your family and they acted all entitled and selfish, you did not. You shut down from the jump the expectation that he will support your family financially and that is super important for you to do. A gift is a gift. If he wanted to do something nice for them, that's awesome of him. But their expectations and insinuations are ridiculous and I would have done the same thing you did. It's clear from your post that you aren't with him for the money, you love him and protected him even from your own family. That's what a partner is supposed to do. So good for you!", "Who expects Christmas gifts from somebody's fianc\u00e9? Whom they've never met! Including a car!", "Socks vs designer T-shirt; possibly understandable.\n\nSocks vs new car\u2026?", "The family has weekly dinners and OP was at this particular one because she flew in for the holidays.", "Edit: NTA obvs", "I agree on that personally, but we don't know the financial context of these people. Fiance seems to be kind of loaded and to some people, a car isn't that expensive. Although, the whole 'we would like to but this house but couldn't afford it' does seem a *little* strange, to say the least.", "He, not she.", "No, you don't expect to get a car for Christmas from a near stranger. No matter what.", "She says her family grew up less well off. They\u2019re being disgustingly entitled.", "I think that they are both men.", "It doesn\u2019t make a difference to how disgusting the family are."]}
