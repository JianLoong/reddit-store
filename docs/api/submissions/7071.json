{"id": 7071, "submission_id": "1099ps3", "title": "AITA for buying $500 of mismarked Prime Rib?", "selftext": "I was visiting my local grocery store on Sunday, (in Michigan) with the intention of buying a couple of pounds of chicken wings and 2 steaks for my wife and I. As the meat department clerk was weighing and preparing my wings, I looked at the Prime Rib, and the very large (think 12/13 pounds a piece) Prime Rib sections were listed with the dollar amount and then \"/ea\". I thought this was peculiar, because that just seemed off to me- it should have said \"dollar amount/lb\". I snapped a photo of the price tag, and then I took a flyer, and I said \"hey! I have a big party coming up. I need all of your Prime Rib.\" He looked at me like I was crazy, and began the process of packaging up 6 of the whole prime ribs. I cook for a Veterans' group on Saturdays, and this would not only go far, but It would save a ton of money on their budget.\n\nI went up to the register, and the meat rang up for over $140/per package. I scanned each of them, I paid the price, and I walked right over to Customer service. The customer service attendant got very wide eyed, and called over a manager. I walked with the manager over to the meat area, where the price was still displayed as $17.99 EACH, and I let him know that due to the Scanner Law, I just want the difference, with the $5.00 added to each. \n\nThe manager was livid. They completed the refund of the difference, and he said to me \"this could very well lead to someone losing their job\". At that point, I said \"you can't be serious. I'll return the meat. Nobody needs to lose their job\". The manager responded with \"maybe you shouldn't have taken advantage of the fact that somebody made a mistake, because it's already too late\". \n\nSo, am I the asshole here for taking advantage of the incorrect price?", "created_utc": 1673456556, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1099ps3/aita_for_buying_500_of_mismarked_prime_rib/", "score": 778, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That manager however is an asshole if he is going to fire someone over $500, or blame you for their mistake.", "NTA..it's a major grocery chain. \nI imagine the manager was just trying to make you feel bad. Grocery stores throw away tons of food every day and destroy it so it can't even be used to serve the homeless etc. \n\nFuck em. I'm never mad at people for stealing food.", "Lawl at all the y t a\n\nNTA by a huge mile, the manager needs to do their job and not guilt trip you for taking advantage of the law.", "NTA - they should\u2019ve been more careful. Not your problem. Enjoy the ribs!", "YTA", "YTA for sure. You knowingly tried to take advantage of a deal that even was a mistake by your own admission. This wasn't some minor difference of \"oh the bananas said they were 54cents total, not 54cents/lb\". Like imagine a car being listed at $1000 vs $10000. That's a 90% different that I do not think you could make a reasonable argument for other than you were taking advantage of a mistake.\n\nLegally you make it sound like you're fine, but you undoubtedly were the AH here. Some people are okay with how you went about it, but I personally would've tried to ring it up at the registers to see if it rang up on sale. If it did, I'd buy it, if it didn't, it was a mistake. You went through extra effort at customer service to be a dick.", "YTA. Grocery stores especially local ones run on razor thin margins. You knew it was a mistake and did it to enrich yourself. And the fact the register rang it how you thought it should be, but you didn't question it. You pushed the issue to take advantage of a mistake. You wouldn't like it if someone took advantage of you.", "NTA, they fucked up, it's a chain store who no doubt pays employees minimum wage or close to it and if they didn't want you to return it that's on them. So fuck em", "There are two competing issues here:\n\nFirst, it's unethical to snap up a deal when there's an obvious pricing error.  Oftentimes, courts won't enforce contracts with such obvious errors.  That's why, if someone on Amazon puts diamond rings on sale but misses the decimal point, they can cancel the $100.00 sale that was supposed to be 10,000.00. Finding good deals is one thing; taking advantage of blatant errors is another.\n\nSecond, there are HUGE problems with stores with lots of SKUs--particularly grocery and big box stores--advertising sales on products and then not changing the sale price in their computer systems.  It entices people to make a purchase (sometimes an impulse purchase), or it might even entice people to come into a store they otherwise wouldn't go into, purchase the sale product and a bunch of other stuff, when in fact they ended up paying full price.  It's a triple problem because oftentimes the prices are different by only a buck or so, so it's not worth the consumers' time to (a) remember the marked price, (b) record the marked price, (c) review the receipt, (d) hold up a checkout line and/or hassle with a manager to get the right price.  But if a store screws 1,000 people out of $1 five times, they've made an extra $5K in profits.  So, legislatures enacted scanner laws to (a) encourage consumers to hold stores accountable, and (b) **to place the risk of loss on the store.** They screw up on their ticketed pricing--they need to honor it.  It might lead to some unfairness to the store--accidental tagging by employees that the store has to honor--but that's reasonable in light of the goal of the legislation--to stop stores' predatory practices of intentionally or recklessly changing advertised prices without changing the price in their computers.\n\nHow do those two issues play out here?\n\nThis pricing clearly wasn't the type of pricing the scanner laws were intended to protect against.  You've not said that there were big advertisements \"Prime rib--$15 each!\" somewhere.  It was just the deli sign.  Further, the price wasn't an inaccurate discount--let's say prime rib is normally $15 per pound, but someone dropped the \"1\" and it was advertised as \"$5 per pound\"-- it was a mislabeling of quantity--\"ea\" instead of \"lb\". No malicious store would make such an error, and no consumer would actually reasonably believe the error. \n\nIt's even possible that the scanner law might not apply to such a situation.  But even if it does, does the fact that the scanner law places the risk of loss on the store, and the store knows this, relieve you of being TA and taking the advantage of the situation?  I think it's close, but I vote no.  Why? Because this type of error is so far away from the scanner law's purpose, and your decision to take advantage of the known error was so egregious by purchasing their entire stock.  The fact that you're using this for charitable purposes makes you a little less of AH, but that doesn't overcome it.  \n\nAlso, the fact that the store is owned by a multi-billion dollar corporation doesn't overcome it, either.  While a mom and pop grocery would feel such a loss in their commercial bottom line, someone is going to feel this loss too, in the loss of their job for what is at worst negligence and may have actually been ignorance.  And that loss might actually have more negative and far-reaching consequences than a $500 loss in profits.\n\nTL;DR: YTA.", "Wait, you didn\u2019t just buy one; you bought their entire stock? That\u2019s totally an AH move. It sounds like an honest mistake. Your intent was to screw the store over and rub their face in it. YTA big time. And I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re surprised this would cost someone their job. It\u2019s a costly mistake.", "YTA, obviously, and it doesn't matter that this a major grocery chain. Of course billion dollar companies don't need to care about $500, but they still do, and they still frequently fire the minimum wage employees who make those mistakes without a second thought. \n\nWhy do people behave this way? What did you gain from taking advantage of an obvious mistake? You live in a society.", "First, you took advantage of a situation that you knew full well was wrong. It would have been easier for you to just ask the meat dept. worker if that price was correct. But no. You had to be greedy.\n\nThen you capitalized on this error to clean out their entire stock of that cut, leaving none for anyone else. Your selfishness has now ensured no one else can have any until new stock arrives. \n\nAnd to top it off, some poor soul who is just trying to earn a living and support their family is now out of a job. All because of your selfishness and greed. Way to go champ.\n\nYour greed, selfishness, and lack of concern or empathy for all the people you have harmed makes you an evil and wicked person. And also, YTA.", "Yeah my dude you where definitely in the wrong and you added the when veterans thing so you would seem like a less of an asshole. YTA", "YTA \u2014 you clearly know it was wrong by how you wrote your post, but you did it any way. Honesty, integrity, and honor are dying values in this country being replaced with \u201cme-ism\u201d. It\u2019s no wonder we live in such a polarized world these days where everyone is focused on looking out for themselves vs. others and doing the right thing.", "YTA. You're legally on solid ground apparently. If you had gone shopping for Prime Rib and took advantage of the error for the 2 steaks, then maybe.  Not for hundreds of dollars of meat, no.\n\nYou know right from wrong, clearly. Tell all your friend/family/colleagues and see if they celebrate you. It's doubtful.", "NTA. Someone made a mistake, you seen an opportunity and took it. Nobody thought the guy who got a whole parmesan wheel for like $15 was an asshole yet everyone here says you are. Go you, I wish my shops made mistakes like this", "YTA\n\nYou knew something was way way off, and followed through on it anyway. If you somehow had no idea what that should have cost I'd say your off the hook, but that's not the case.\n\nIt's not as big a deal if it's something small (e.g. someone got a price wrong by a dollar or something), but with a financial difference that large we're in a different space. Further, if it was you taking advantage of overlapping coupons and savings, that would be ok too, because the company would have set it up that way, and so would be responsible. Not the case here.\n\nBased on what you said, you paid 17.99 /ea for 6 items, so 107.94, instead of 140 /ea which would have been 840 dollars for a difference of 732.06. That's enough money to pay 6 people 15 dollars an hour for a full work day. That's huge.\n\nWhile I disagree with the manager about someone losing their job, in so far that it was a costly, but small honest mistake; and in my view a consequence of a bad QA/QC process for high value items, and so not on the employee themselves; what you did was problematic for sure.", "This happened to me once. Chicken breast tender packages were marked at $1 each instead of per pound (1980\u2019s). I knew that was wrong so I alerted the clerk (I did have to debate with myself first). He thanked me and told me to take as many as I wanted at the wrong price to thank me, and I took 2 packages so as not to be greedy. So OP is kinda YTA for taking unfair advantage.", "YTA I personally don\u2019t like it when people take advantage of obvious mistakes in pricing. You knew very well they didn\u2019t intend to sell it at that price.", "YTA.\n\nYou knew the price was labelled wrong. You should have simply called attention to the fact. Instead, you intentionally ripped off the store for your own benefit.\n\nSounds like you're legally in the clear, but that doesn't make it right.", "I would go N T A if you bought one or two, but you literally intentionally purchased an excessive amount knowing it was an error.  Especially since this was a small business.  A place like Walmart, who cares. Local small businesses already struggle.  So YTA for the level you took it to and for not letting them know.", "YTA and your aware of that, ok expecting 1 prime rib at the price in err is one thing, but all they had in stock.  Sadly too many people fail to realize human errors like this usually results in someone losing their job or perhaps more than 1.  Who absorbs these losses?  Big business... not on your life, the little guy and those of us purchasing other goods.", "ESH. Buying one would have been N T A but clearing them out makes you an Y T A. Reason for the ESH the manager is also an ah as he could have handled it differently. It's HIS job to make sure the pricing is right.", "YTA for exploiting that shit hardcore; one piece would\u2019ve been one thing.\n\nJust to add context that isn\u2019t part of this:\n\nOP said it is the biggest grocery store chain in the US. That\u2019s Kroger.\n\nKroger and Albertsons are in the process of merging and probably thousands of people are going to get laid off, and store folks are definitely aware and nervous.\n\nSomeone is absolutely going to lose their job over this, because of the level OP felt entitled to go to. This put a target on someone\u2019s back.", "YTA. Scanner law is to prevent shady bait/switch tactics. You exploited an obvious error to the absolute possible extreme. $732 isn't a small error, that's almost 50 hours of wages @ $15/hour so someone is losing their job.", "I\u2019m so torn here. If it scanned at the listed price, I\u2019d say you were just taking advantage of an error, which I honestly can\u2019t say I\u2019ve never done. \n\nWhere I start thinking YMBTA is that you went ahead and made the store enforce the wrong price, even though everyone involved knew it was an error *and* you bought *all* the prime rib. This goes beyond taking advantage and gets into AH territory. \n\nSomeone likely will lose their job over this. When I was a cashier at a grocery store in high school, I was fired for a customer writing a check (yeah this was a long time ago) for $100 less than their order, which meant my till was $100 short. I should have double checked, but I didn\u2019t. Same thing with the employee who put the wrong price up. Should one mistake cost you a job? Probably not, but that\u2019s the way this usually shakes out. \n\nI honestly am not sure which way to go with this one, but if I\u2019m forced to make a judgment:\n\nYTA.", "YTA Trying to capitalize on an obvious mistake. If I dropped my wallet by mistake would you keep it? Where do you draw the line?", "Yes, YTA. Just because you were legally in the clear doesn't make this an a-hole move. And just because it is a big corporation doesn't mean someone from your local community that works there isn't going to lose their job over this.", "YTA.\n\nAssuming you're talking about the Michigan Shopping Reform and Modernization Act, I don't think it even applies, uder 445.317 S7(2)(a).\n\n> The manager responded with \"maybe you shouldn't have taken advantage of the fact that somebody made a mistake, because it's already too late\".\n\nCorrect.  You committed purposeful fraud.\n\nThe purpose of the law is to prevent deceit from the retailer, not to allow you to reap an unearned windfall by noticing an error, then purposefully exploiting it.", "This is why the word community means absolutely nothing anymore. Everyone trying to fuck everyone over for a quick buck. If you trained an AI to read reddit posts, and Reddit posts only, I bet it would take no time at all for the AI to start nuking towns", "YTA- generally a grocery store can\u2019t resell a fresh item like this once you have taken possession of it. You took advantage, you knew you were taking advantage. You should have known a mistake of this magnitude could cost someone their job. Probably someone who is fairly low paid to begin with. If you don\u2019t care, fine. If you do care, you shouldn\u2019t have done it.", "YTA.  I can understand buying one prime rib at the price but to take it all and abuse the scanner law in a clearly simple mistake puts you into AH territory in my book.", "This is tough. While you were well within your right to do that, I think it was the wrong thing to do. You already knew the price was wrong, so you should\u2019ve said something instead of gaming the system. Only when you realized that there are consequences for gaming the system, you wanted out. They\u2019re getting written up either way for a mistake you could\u2019ve helped them with, but instead exploited them for. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. You knew it was an error. Even so, if you just got one or two it\u2019s one thing but you bought every single one they had KNOWING it was marked wrong. That alone makes you the AH. Nice people would point out to the butcher the possible mistake. You, on the other hand, saw the mistake and immediately got selfish and took advantage.  This speaks volumes to the kind of person you are", "You knew it was wrong and went ahead anyway. And you took ALL  of the prime rib.

Profit margins are minuscule at both places (and you're a thief)", "YTA. Because you did it knowingly and because you took all of the prime rib in stock.", "YTA.  \nPricing for the most part is an 'invitation to treat' they are not required to honour a price that is a genuine mistake. If it was intentional, then you may have a case but given it was just a unit mistake and likely just for that product then there's not much to stand on. Many shops will honour a simple or small labelling error as it's good PR but the fact you saw the mistake and then went to exploit it to the max, means YTA. If you had just bought one, then the ball would be in the other court (of opinion).", "YTA. It was obvious a mistake was made.", "YTA\n\nYou really should have said something. I agree you definitely should have gotten listed price on that one, that is on them. But buying them all is pretty awful.\n\nThis is coming from someone who got a bottle of Dom for $9 once because it rung up incorrectly (it was on sale for $99). I tried to tell them that was wrong, he said $9 again (this was while I was stationed in Korea). I didn't go back and grab a case, I was just happy my celebration was going to be a lot cheaper, and I had no guilt because I tried to do the right thing.", "Scanner laws vary by state I think.  It would be interesting to know if this would actually hold up.  The whole rigamoll you went through to pull a gotcha on the manager and customer service person, I don\u2019t know.  \n\nRings a little hollow to me.  Someone expendable probably will lose their job.  I couldn\u2019t do it but if you\u2019re technically right, I guess you\u2019re technically right.  \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is I don\u2019t like it \ud83d\ude02 YTA.", "YTA you knew it was a wrong price and decided to be dishonest.\n\neta: Then you bought ALL of it. Which is a bonus greedy AH move.", "YTA. You knew it was the wrong price it was human error not a system issue with the scanner it scanned at the right price but you decided to take advantage of that. I\u2019m sick of people doing the wrong thing and then trying to excuse it as well anyone would have. No they wouldn\u2019t have. A decent honest person would have said hey mate you might want to check that mistake you made and for sure you defo cost someone their job.", "The second i question whether my choice felt shady, is the second i, already, know the answer.

You could have just pointed out to the manager but you chose not to", "ESH. In Canada the pricing code of conduct only applies to the first item to prevent exactly this kind of outcome. One deeply discounted item due to error is one thing, but if someone might lose their job, it becomes quite another. Ofc, there are other ways of dealing with errors than firing someone, but still.....", "I'm stuck in the middle here. Morally speaking, YTA regardless of posted pricing.

Especially if this is a locally owned grocery store, you're effecting more people than you realize.", "YTA.  You knew it was a pricing mistake when you took the pic.  It's one thing to do it with a single prime rib, but to wipe out their entire inventory is gluttonous.

As the meat department clerk was weighing and preparing my wings, I looked at the Prime Rib, and the very large (think 12/13 pounds a piece) Prime Rib sections were listed with the dollar amount and then \"/ea\". I thought this was peculiar, because that just seemed off to me- it should have said \"dollar amount/lb\". I snapped a photo of the price tag, and then I took a flyer, and I said \"hey! I have a big party coming up. I need all of your Prime Rib.\" He looked at me like I was crazy, and began the process of packaging up 6 of the whole prime ribs. I cook for a Veterans' group on Saturdays, and this would not only go far, but It would save a ton of money on their budget.\n\nI went up to the register, and the meat rang up for over $140/per package. I scanned each of them, I paid the price, and I walked right over to Customer service. The customer service attendant got very wide eyed, and called over a manager. I walked with the manager over to the meat area, where the price was still displayed as $17.99 EACH, and I let him know that due to the Scanner Law, I just want the difference, with the $5.00 added to each. \n\nThe manager was livid. They completed the refund of the difference, and he said to me \"this could very well lead to someone losing their job\". At that point, I said \"you can't be serious. I'll return the meat. Nobody needs to lose their job\". The manager responded with \"maybe you shouldn't have taken advantage of the fact that somebody made a mistake, because it's already too late\". \n\nSo, am I the asshole here for taking advantage of the incorrect price?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
