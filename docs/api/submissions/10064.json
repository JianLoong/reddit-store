She had her sweatshirt on one, her keys on another, her phone on one, and a Gatorade bottle on the last. I needed the last machine for tricep extensions.\n\nI worked around her for about 45 minutes. When I had finished every other exercise, I moved her now empty Gatorade bottle from the tricep machine and started doing a set. Before I'd finished, she stopped what she was doing, came over and said her stuff was there.\n\nI replied that her stuff was everywhere, but she can't just reserve half the gym. She stuttered a little, then stormed off to the front desk and threw a fit. The guy working the desk just shrugged and probably told her more or less the same thing.\n\nSo next thing I know, she retrieved her phone, started filming me and said, \"Y'all aren't going to believe what just happened. I'm working out at the gym, I step away from my machine for a second and this asshole takes it. I tell him nicely that I was using it and he tells me to go fuck myself.\"\n\nBy that point, I was done with my three sets.

I know they have a no filming others policy. Whether they enforce it is another question. Either way, report her.  Others may not be so comfortable with confrontation, or confidence in even going to the gym.", "Lol.  Yeah, I definitely understand what you are saying.  The gym management needs to be made aware of her little scheme so they can help her understand that the gym is a shared property.

I would report her, but I\u2019m petty.", "Maybe, but that doesn't mean this was the best way to handle things.  You have to at least express that you wish to use the machine and give the person the opportunity to move.  She wasn't the AH b/c she didn't read your mind.", "Gym etiquette applies to OP. The fact that there was someone failing to observe it doesn\u2019t turn the situation into a free-for-all.

OP didn\u2019t start the issue, but they share some blame for its escalation.", "And that would\u2019ve been a great thing to explain to this woman instead of just moving her shit and plunking down for three sets.
