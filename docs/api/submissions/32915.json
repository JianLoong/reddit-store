(31 threw the 4th) He told me that they where going to stay in my room and I was going to sleep in a blow up mattress. I told him no, and I don\u2019t want people I don\u2019t know in my room sleeping because I don\u2019t feel comfortable, specially because I don\u2019t like kids messing around with my valuable stuff once I heard that they are coming with them. (I have a 1000$+ gaming setup that I use for my college and gaming purposes) I told him no, and started to get increasingly frustrated with him and eventually went to my room. This morning I receive a text from my dad telling me\n\n \u201cThe room upstairs needs to be used for your mother\u2019s friends. That is the only space that we have.  We are asking you nicely which your mom and I should not have to. When my parents said that we had to do something we did it with out giving problems or fights. So I expect the same from you.\u201d\n\nI did not respond but essentially I feel like they treat me like a kid still which has been ongoing problem for the longest time. I have been trying to find a place so that I can move out closer to my college but don\u2019t have the financial means to do so. Everything is paid for by a grant that I get from the government, so all I would have to worry about is trying to find a job that helps me pay for what I need. \n\nSo AITA?\n\n\nEdit: to clear things up, I do work. I have been looking and making plans to move out for the past 5 months, the issues have been facing is to find a job that has the flexibility for me to be able to take classes in person but if necessary to take them online as well. I do not pay rent, but I do pay for my own food, bills, and utility I do have a part time job but I don\u2019t make as enough because rent in the area near my campus is higher. That is why have not been able to move out.\n\nThe pc setup I have I got a year and a half ago, and have not been buying recently for it and has been investing my time trying to find a way to move out\n\nAlso I will be graduating this coming fall 2024  \n", "created_utc": 1702402637, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18grhs5/aita_for_not_letting_my_parents_friends_and_kids/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
