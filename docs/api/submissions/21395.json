Nothing wrong with that. If he didn't want people to know those things, he shouldn't have done them in the first place.", "ESH. None of this is healthy. You should have just stayed out of their fights instead of egging them on. Instead you helped create an even unhealthier environment for your child just to impress the new girlfriend.", "NTA. Yall are coparenting. And even though most people who coparent don't have a good relationship with their ex or their new girlfriend/wife. It seems like you do. She confided in you about the negative aspects of her relationship. She wasn't rubbing it in your face that she is now dating your ex. She sounds like she needs a friend to confide in. She seems like she trusts you as a true friend. As a true friend and somebody who is going to be in your kids life. You should make her aware of your ex. Relationships always seem good at first, especially with a narcissist. I'd give her the honest truth and she can make her decision from there. But it seems like she is already on the outs with your ex. But hey, if you like her. She may be worth keeping in your life as a friend. She sounds like a solid woman. And it also seems like she needs a friend too. Plus making friends as an adult is hard as it is", "No, you are shit stirring.\n\nThere are other ways to bond with this woman.

YTA", "ESH.  Don't make an already unhealthy relationship worse, your child has to live there as well and y'all are all serving as role models for how relationships should go. New gf should never have to deal with that, but being toxic back doesn't improve the situation at all. \n\nIf you had been trying to give her a warning to skedaddle that might be different but if you are capable of having mature relationships you should know 'ammo' is not something you ever want to 'use' if you're trying to have a healthy one", "ESH. You are no longer a part of his life other than being his coparent. It's on him to share as much of his life with his gf as he feels comfortable doing. Just because he behaved one way with you doesn't mean that will be repeated.\n\nShe shouldn't be discussing her current relationship with his ex-wife. That's a boundary being crossed on her part.\n\nAll that being said, he sounds like a bit of a tool. Everyone needs to get out of this enmeshed behaviour.", "YTA \n\nThe only concern you and your ex have between you now is your child. It's not your place or business to know about their arguments and its not your place to give her ammo against him to essentially try to get a better relationship with her. If they're already arguing then your interference could make it worse or it could blow up in your own face and make things worse for yourself. Stay out if their business and just concentrate on an amicable relationship with him to coparent", "ESH, but you\u2019re the worst. Their relationship is not your business (except as it pertains to the health and safety of your child), and you can never have an unbiased view on it in a way to be any way helpful. All you\u2019re doing is sowing discord in a relationship that occurs in front of your child.  \n\nThe other two adults seem like jerks, but you\u2019re doing something that benefits you in no way except that it pisses off someone you don\u2019t like.  That\u2019s some serious asshole behavior. \n\nWorse, it risks emotional harm to your own six year old child. WTF is wrong with you?", "YTA\n\nWhy should you and his girlfriend have a good relationship? Whilst it\u2019s nice for your child if you do, it\u2019s not the reality for most people. \n\nLeave them to get on with their own relationship. Co-parent well with your husband and all get on with your lives.", "Yes, I'm sure this will help the relationship with his gf, but it certainly won't help the relationship with him (you know, the guy you coparent your child with!)\n\nESH", "ESH. If it does not pertain co-raising your child, then steer clear of their business. If excrement is flying around you want to duck as opposed to sticking your neck out.", "ESH. She shouldn\u2019t be asking for dirt on your ex, if they have problems they need to work through that themselves. You should not be providing dirt since you have to coparent with this man. His gf may not be around for the next 12 years but he will.
