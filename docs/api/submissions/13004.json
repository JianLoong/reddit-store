When we got home, my mom invited us to join a last-minute family trip to Mexico leaving the next morning. This was the first time my wife and I had time off together since our honeymoon last summer. We agreed and very excited, but my wife was worried about how to break the news to her parents, who are very protective and wary of travel to foreign countries due to safety concerns.\n\nWhen we told her parents, they were upset and said that we were being ignorant and endangering ourselves. They also criticized us for not doing more research and accused us of being irresponsible for traveling. We apologized for not giving them a heads up, but they were still angry and said that they'd rather not have known about the trip at all.\n\nI later texted my father-in-law to apologize again and offer updates on our safety during the trip. Then he said \u201cour weekend is going to be hell worrying about you guys\u201d. He oddly offered us a free vacation anywhere in the US, I suggested planning a family trip together for the future which he didn\u2019t respond to. But instead by saying he just wanted us to text him when we were back home safe and then his final statement was \u201cjust to let you know, I\u2019m totally disappointed in your decision to keep my daughter safe\u201c.\n\nI feel like the asshole because I respect and trust my father-in-law and hate to disappoint him, but at the same time, my wife and I are adults and should be able to make our own decisions about travel.

You're definitely NTA. Please don't apologize for something you didn't do wrong. You and your wife are adults, you don't need to clear all your movements with your in-laws and get their permission to go on a trip. Go, have fun, take a ton of pictures, and don't bring them a souvenir.", "NTA You and your wife are adults and don't need \"permission\" from your in-laws to travel anywhere. Do they really expect you and your wife to hold their hands the rest of your lives? While it's okay to apologize for making them worry any other apologies is really unnecessary.", "NTA. It doesn't sound like you and your wife have a healthy relationship with your in laws. It's none of their business whether you both choose to travel abroad and you should in no way feel like you've done something wrong. Your in laws sound like they've got a very misinformed view of the world.", "NTA - your in-laws are being ridiculous.  Their daughter is an adult and can make any decision she wants.  Your in-laws need to cut the damn cord.", "NTA but why even tell them? Just go. Tell them when you get back. Or don't.", "NTA, have your in-laws ever heard about how dangerous the US is and how much gun violence we have here? I\u2019ve felt safer in parts of Mexico than I do in my own major US city. Bottom line is exactly what you said, that you and your wife are adults and can travel wherever you want.", "NTA. If you are old enough to be married you should be old enough to decide on travel plans without the IL input. \n\nAlso this is really racist of them to say only the US is safe while in the eyes of most the country can be dangerous especially with the gun violence rates.", "How old are you? Because I don't think adults should be controlled by their parents any any way and the fact, that you're feeling guilty that you want to travel, says a lot about this relationship with her parents. I think you need to set boundaries. \nNTA, but her parents clearly are.", "NTA\n\n>I feel like the asshole because I respect and trust my father-in-law and hate to disappoint him\n\nYour in-laws are disappointing themselves by infantilising their adult daughter with their ridiculous expectations and paranoid need for control over her (your) life. You are under zero obligation to run any decision you make by them first. Unless, of course, those decisions impact them directly. This is not one of those occasions.\n\nThe only person who can deal with this is your wife. She needs to stand up to her parents and establish boundaries so that you can live your married life without them constantly breathing down your necks. This isn't going to be an easy fix, though; this has been your wife's normal for her entire life and I think she needs counselling/therapy to help her realise her agency as an adult - and cut the cord with her parents.\n\nThis is going to be a long, hard road for your wife and I wish her the best of luck with it.", "NTA, if you're adults then you can choose where and when and with whom you vacation with.", "Nta. Mexico is supposed to be safe enough as long as you stay in the tourist areas and like you said, you\u2019re both adults. Also your wife is an adult and agreed to go, she is in charge of deciding if it\u2019s safe enough for her, not you or her parents.", "NTA. If you knew they were this way, why did you tell them? After you return your wife should be the one who tells her parents this crap has to end. You married your wife worry about disappointing her and only her, the folks can get over it or stay mad.", "NTA. Ignoring the fact that international travel is generally accepted to not be the kind of risk your in-laws frame it as, you\u2019re adults. You\u2019re expected to make choices. Sometimes other adults will disapprove of those choices. That\u2019s okay. \n\nBy trying to shame you and bribe you into making different choices, you in-laws show that they think you\u2019re children to be manipulated, not adults to be reasoned with. Presumably, they have good reasons to think international travel is dangerous. If those reasons are so compelling, they should share them with you. If you agree, you won\u2019t travel. If you don\u2019t agree, you will. That\u2019s how adults get adults to do what they want.\n\nI wonder if your relationship with them is based on carrots (Free Trip!) and sticks (We disapprove of how you keep our daughter safe). \n\nJust to be clear, your wife made the choice to go, right?  If so, the fact that they\u2019re applying pressure to you feels particularly odd - almost as though they know their child will just roll her eyes at them, but they think you\u2019ll treat them with more respect.", "Good lord. You guys need to put up some strict boundaries with her parents. You\u2019re not children anymore.

Ignore him. No other reasonable solution.", "NTA", "NTA. Your inlaws need therapy. Do not apologize because they have irrational fears about travel to other countries. Or are racist.", "Oh honestly.\n\nEdit: why did you have to \u201cbreak the news\u201d anyway? This whole thing is the most middle school teenage drama. Just GO ON VACATION without asking permission from everyone. Christ.", "NTA people are traveling all over the world... why  tell them anything ya are adults and why are you  apologizing....", "Definitely NTA, you shouldn\u2019t care what they think.", "NTA...In-laws need to chill out and be reasonable. Mexico \\*isn't\\* all that safe, but you stay in the touristy areas and you will, generally, be left alone and safe. I would worry more, if I were FIL, if you said you were going to Portland or Chicago! Long as you get her home safe, and show there were no issues and that it's safe to go to Mexico, you should be ok. They need to let you grow up and be adults.", "NTA - your in-laws sound like micromanaging demons\u2026 do they even have passports??? You\u2019ve done nothing wrong, they\u2019re doing everything wrong here \u2026", "NTA.\n\nYour wife's parents' concerns are understandable, but this is entirely your decision. You were never obligated to inform them in advance, to make the same choice they would have made, or to apologize when you made a different choice.\n\nThe very most you owed them was to be polite when they expressed their concerns, but after that they had no business to continue to press them on you. Their behavior would make me look for other occasions to see if there is a pattern of their overstepping their boundaries so you can respond appropriately.", "So let me in tell you a little secret. If you don't act like adults people won't treat you like adults. So if you live with your parents, take your vacation with them, are afraid of your in law reactions and want to up date them like your a teenager then they will all treat you like kids", "ESH. Them for acting like this towards their adult married daughter and you and your wife both for enabling this.
