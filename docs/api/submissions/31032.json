{"id": 31032, "submission_id": "17vwvlb", "title": "AITA for asking my mom and sister to dance with me at my wedding when my mom is married and has a stepdaughter?", "selftext": "I (25f) was raised by a single mom for the majority of my childhood. It was just her, my sister (22f) and me. When I was 15 she started dating a guy called Dave and when I was 17 he moved in with her.   \n He had a 6 year old daughter at the time who ended up moving in with them full time just under 3 years ago. Mom and Dave married a year after that. Dave is an alright guy, his daughter is sweet enough. But I would never say Dave is my dad, my parent or my father figure. My mom is basically everything parental rolled into one. She's it. She's all. She was amazing and still to this day is. My sister and I are so thankful for her and my sister is the best as well.\n\nAfter getting engaged my fiance and I were talking about the traditional father of the bride dance and we both were aware that wasn't happening. At least not a father of the bride dance. I told him it would be really fun and really special if I danced with my mom and sister so he suggested I ask them. This was five months ago. I asked them three months ago, after my fiance and I had some more talking done and figured out if he would dance and if yes, with who.\n\nWhen I did ask, my mom and sister was so happy. Mom said she would love the chance to dance with her girls and to be recognized in that way during the wedding. A lot of people where we lived when I was in elementary school acted like we were doomed because she was a single mom to the two of us. Some old lady neighbors used to talk about how sad our weddings would one day be (they were the really gossipy types who liked to shared their unrequested opinions). My sister was thrilled to be included in the dance because she never expected it. But she has been by my side for so long and I couldn't imagine not including her.\n\nDave was not happy when mom told him about the dance and his daughter was apparently very upset. She and I don't really know each other but she felt left out because my sister was included and not her. Dave said it was a very blatant rejection of the bigger family by choosing to dance with my mom and my sister and leaving him and his daughter out. He said his daughter is 14 and it would have been so easy to include her or to just dance with him as the father figure of our family instead of excluding them entirely and making them seem unimportant.\n\nMy mom and him fought a lot about it because she told him it had been just the three of us for a long time and recognizing that and acknowledging that we will always have a special bond and that she was single handedly responsible for raising the two of us was not an insult to him but an acknowledgement of her and of our relationship. She also told him it would not make sense to include his daughter since there is barely any relationship there with me and her. \n\nHe puts this all on me though and he said I should have reconsidered since I knew my mom was now married and had a stepchild.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700064335, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17vwvlb/aita_for_asking_my_mom_and_sister_to_dance_with/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter is 14, and I understand that may need help understanding that she doesn't always get to be center stage at someone else's event.  You as a grown adult should know better.\"", "Fuck Dave. This isn\u2019t about him. You want to dance with your mom and your sister at your wedding and he better goddamn shut up about it. NTA!", "Omg NTA at all!\n\nIt\u2019s not about her!!  It\u2019s about you!  And perfectly understandable for you to want your mom and sister in this beautiful moment since they are so close to you and for the sentimentality.\n\nCan\u2019t believe Dave is so consumed with his daughter\u2019s inappropriate, immature and completely unreasonable reaction that he isn\u2019t seeing that.\n\nTell Dave and step sis that when she\u2019s getting married, she can have the dance with whomever she wants. \n\nThis is your dance.  She doesn\u2019t even want to be a part of it because she\u2019s supporting you.  How selfish.", "NTA. \n\nOddly enough, your wedding should be about you and your partner, not Dave and his daughter.", "NTA! Honey, do what you want for your wedding! \n\nI had my younger brother give me away because he and I are exceptionally close, he has always looked out for me (including when I was really ill for a while) my dad was hardly ever around and I couldn\u2019t imagine anyone else doing it! It caused a shitstorm with his side of the family but I don\u2019t regret it for one second! \n\nDave needs to get over himself and keep his ego in check. I do hate this whole \u201cI\u2019m the man of the family\u201d thing! \n\nIt might be worth attempting a gentle convo with your step sis though to try and explain it to her as I can\u2019t imagine Dave will be doing a brilliant job of that if he\u2019s so butthurt. \n\nOut of interest, is step sis included in any other way? Is there a role you could give her to feel included? Although you\u2019re not close she may look up to/admire you more than you realise. I was super excited about having older step-siblings when my dad got married and a bit crushed that they weren\u2019t really interested in me. I\u2019m not trying to make you feel guilty, just thinking about it from her perspective.", "NTA. Dave is expecting a lot based if he wants to be treated as a parent based on a relationship that started when you were almost an adult.", "NTA\n\nDave seems a bit self involved. He should be mature enough to understand the situation. Honestly if it was me I would be warning him that if he can't understand the situation and continues to be immature he can stay at home that day.", "NTA\n\nThis is your wedding and you can decide. This is not about Dave and his daughter.", "Nta, your day, your choice.\n\nDave has a right to feel left out, but that's it his feelings then let it drop.  just because he chooses to see it as a negative instead of the positive in which you are actually doing it in, that's his issues.\n\nDon't worry about it how angry he is, it's not going to be a deal breaker and have a great day.", "NTA. You're allowed to dance with those closest to, who you were raised with/by. Instead of Dave getting mad at you, he needs to talk to his daughter about what different families look like and how you including your sister is not a rejection of her.", "If you\u2019d chosen to do a \u201ctraditional\u201d dance with your birth father would Dave still be so fussed? What an awful child he must be. \n\nNTA", "NTA if you don't have any relationship with him or his daughter. Marriage is a piece of paper and that alone doesn't make him or his daughter family. That said, I can see why it can hurt some people's feelings to be left out. In this case though, I think it's more his pride that is hurting, because of how he thinks he'll look to others. I do feel a bit bad for the 14 year old, it probably does hurt her feelings, even if you aren't close. These types of situations are a no-win; either you have to do things in a way that aren't special to you to spare others, or they get their feelings hurt (real or imagined). Sucky situation but you aren't in the wrong.", "NTA. It's your wedding you do whatever you want. Remind him this day is not about him but about you and your soon to be husband. Congratulations!!", "NTA\n\nI love your idea and I hope you have a great wedding.\n\nIf you want (and only IF) you can find a way of including her stepdaughter in the wedding somehow. But that dance is your special moment, enjoy it. You, your sister and your mother deserve it.", "NTA, \n\nAt the end of the day, its your wedding! You get the final say! He didn't raise you at all, it seems like you barely know him, and he barely knows you! So why would he want to dance with you anyways?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The gall people have to try to make weddings about themselves instead of the people getting married. It\u2019s your wedding, your intentions are pure. Who gives a shit what anyone else wants?", "NTA. I think if a father is not there, the bride can choose whoever she wants to do that \"first dance\" with her; I was at a wedding where the bride danced w/her brother, for ex. Her stepfather wasn't upset about it. He'd married her mother when the bride was in her 20s, so he wasn't any kind of father figure to her.", "NTA. Fuck Dave he is just proving he is unworthy.", "NTA and Dave isn't your dad so why does he expect to do this old fashioned dance thing with you? He can do it with his daughter when she gets married. You were practically out of the house when he came along.", "NTA.  This is about your mom being both your mom and your dad.  The stepchild has no place in the dance.", "NTA", "NTA tell Dave to fuck off. You can, he won\u2019t hear you as his head is stuck right up his self-important arse\u2026", "NTA! \n\nI\u2019m not normally a fan of weddings at all, but this is the sweetest thing! Absolutely chills down my spine. Congrats & dance to your hearts\u2019 content.", "NTA - Dave didn't raise you at all so why would you have him in a fatherly role? That just doesn't make sense. You were already basically grown when he came around. There's no reason to include him, unless you just really wanted to. And you were already grown and presumably moved out by the time his daughter moved in so there's really no relationship there, so again doesn't make sense to include her in the dance. \n\nAnd I just want to say Kudos to your mom for standing up to him. A lot of AITA the parent tries to push the step-parent's agenda. So I'm glad that she stood up to him and let him know that this doesn't make sense.", "NTA\n\nYou have no reason to honor him or his daughter. \n\nYou have every reason to honor your mom and your sister. \n\nThis is an HONOR dance. A first dance and a good bye dance to your baby girl. Be it a father, mother, sister, brother. \n\nI was a wedding photographer and saw the Father Daughter dance go in many different directions, including a mirror of yours. A father danced with his son. The wife was by me as I did pictures. As the second song started she joined her husband, and pulled his dad back so the three of them danced for about half the song.", "NTA. Dave is confused this has nothing to do with your mothers relationship with him or his daughter, it is only about your relationship with your mother. He clearly needs to be reminded that he didn\u2019t enter your life until you were nearly an adult, and therefore he and his daughter had nothing to do with raising you or shaping you as a person. His daughter is old enough to recognize that she doesn\u2019t need to be the center of attention at a wedding for someone she barely knows. And if she has a problem with that, Dave needs to parent her, not attempt to manipulate others into giving her to her self-centered attitude. Let Dave know that he doesn\u2019t need to come to the wedding if he can\u2019t figure out who the main character of the day is.", "NTA And to be fair, father of the bride dances suck. I\u2019ve read enough of those posts to know.", "NTA but I hope she's in the family photos lol", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThat your mom is married now and has a stepdaughter has nothing to do with you.

Of course you are in the right to only want to be including YOUR family but on the other hand they also have a right to feel rejected and cut out as a whole.\n\nIt's not like you are wrong but he is not wrong for wanting to be seen as part of the family even when you don't feel that way .\n\nI guess you can go on with it and I assume your mom will always choose you. But it will leave a bad stain in their marriage . maybe it is a better choice to make everyone and use cards and write well wishes for the couple and use this laterns to send it into the sky.\n\nI get your side but I also get their side it never feels good to be unwanted", " Just wondering, is Dave paying for the wedding?  By this I mean fully, not just helping out.", "You can dance with whomever you wish. I think Dave should also dance with his daughter, as she wants to be involved. Customs are not laws.", "Your Mom rocks. Dance with your Mom and sister. It will be beautiful and it will mean the world to you. Step-Dad is an asshole. Do I feel bad for his daughter for having a father that is making her feel worse. He can help her understand but he is just trying to make himself feel better. He is an asshole to all of you. \n\nNTA Have the wedding you want.", "NTA, like at all!! i hate so much when people make something about them when it just has zero to do with them\u2026 this is about your relationship with your mum, NOTHING to do with him!! honestly fuck Dave.", "NTA he is ridiculous.", "Nta tell him that actually it\u2019s all on him,the man who married a woman knowing full well she came with two daughters she raised on her own.\n\n\u201c..since I knew my mom was now married and had a stepchild\u201d and he knew she had two kids before he came into the picture. \nI would understand if he was just upset for his kid and maybe trying to say to just include her cause she is a kid but she\u2019s also a kid who\u2019s old enough to understand that she won\u2019t be included in everything and why this is important to you and probably been the way you\u2019d have your wedding if they hadn\u2019t come into the picture and you\u2019re allowed that.\n\nHis comment about just letting him have the dance as the father figure tells me he\u2019s just slighted by the fact his mere presence in your life doesn\u2019t automatically entitle him to the role of father or father of the bride. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s missing out his own daughter will no doubt have him at her wedding.\nHe didn\u2019t raise you and he needs to understand there\u2019s a difference between your relationship with him and his daughters relationship with your mum.\nYour mum might be taking an active parenting role for his daughter and raising her but that doesn\u2019t mean he had any input with you.\nHe needs to realise that you don\u2019t even need to invite him, yes common courtesy and respect for it being your mums husband but you have no obligation to him, you don\u2019t even need to invite blood relatives for the simplest of reasons, like you don\u2019t want them there.\nYou\u2019ve not excluded them, just like you\u2019re not excluding everyone else at the wedding, it\u2019s just something between you,your mum and sister on your day", "Dave are you asking to dance with me?", "Nta. Say you've reconsidered it and you came to the same conclusion now do one", "Exactly the words I was going to say! FUCK DAVE! You do your wedding how you want.", "She doesn't have to offer anything to the step-sister. Dave needs to deal with his daughter. 14 is old enough for Dave to explain that she is not entitled to a place in her step-sister wedding. Nobody gets to put the responsibility of how Dave's daughter feels about her wedding on OP. OP doesn't need to make this better for anyone as she didn't do anything wrong.", "My though as well.", "People who barely have a relationship with the bride shouldn\u2019t feel entitled to having a special dance.", "He's not paying for the wedding.", "I doubt the dad feels entitled to have a dance but he feels sorry for his daughter his step daughters didn't gave her a chance to get to know them of course the age gab was an issue  but I always wonder what you have to do as a step parents to get this [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ehZ48mCTgtk](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ehZ48mCTgtk)", "Thank you for the response.  \n\nNTA\n\nIt would seem that Dave wants (or seems to want) his marriage to your mother to be as traditional as possible - e.g. him being the fatherly figure, his daughter accepted as a sister to you and your sister, and this may be why he is taking issue with the dance.  He is within his right to feel the way he does but not to try to guilt or manipulate you to change your mind or demand to have his daughter in this special dance.  This wedding is about you and your fianc\u00e9.   \n\nBy simple calculation from your post, you were already 22 when his daughter moved in to live with everyone? (25 - 3) If this is the case, then I don't really see how Dave could think that you and his daughter would have had anytime to really bond.  Dave moved in when you were 17, still not much time for a bonding experience as you are transitioning into a young adult.\n\nCongratulations on your wedding!!  I hope all goes well and everyone acts cordial.  You deserve your dance and choosing your mother and sister for the traditional \"father / daughter\" dance sounds awesome!"]}
