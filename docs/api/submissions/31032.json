It was just her, my sister (22f) and me. When I was 15 she started dating a guy called Dave and when I was 17 he moved in with her.   \n He had a 6 year old daughter at the time who ended up moving in with them full time just under 3 years ago. Mom and Dave married a year after that. Dave is an alright guy, his daughter is sweet enough. But I would never say Dave is my dad, my parent or my father figure. My mom is basically everything parental rolled into one. She's it. She's all. She was amazing and still to this day is. My sister and I are so thankful for her and my sister is the best as well.\n\nAfter getting engaged my fiance and I were talking about the traditional father of the bride dance and we both were aware that wasn't happening. At least not a father of the bride dance. I told him it would be really fun and really special if I danced with my mom and sister so he suggested I ask them. This was five months ago. I asked them three months ago, after my fiance and I had some more talking done and figured out if he would dance and if yes, with who.\n\nWhen I did ask, my mom and sister was so happy. Mom said she would love the chance to dance with her girls and to be recognized in that way during the wedding. A lot of people where we lived when I was in elementary school acted like we were doomed because she was a single mom to the two of us. Some old lady neighbors used to talk about how sad our weddings would one day be (they were the really gossipy types who liked to shared their unrequested opinions). My sister was thrilled to be included in the dance because she never expected it. But she has been by my side for so long and I couldn't imagine not including her.\n\nDave was not happy when mom told him about the dance and his daughter was apparently very upset. She and I don't really know each other but she felt left out because my sister was included and not her. Dave said it was a very blatant rejection of the bigger family by choosing to dance with my mom and my sister and leaving him and his daughter out. He said his daughter is 14 and it would have been so easy to include her or to just dance with him as the father figure of our family instead of excluding them entirely and making them seem unimportant.\n\nMy mom and him fought a lot about it because she told him it had been just the three of us for a long time and recognizing that and acknowledging that we will always have a special bond and that she was single handedly responsible for raising the two of us was not an insult to him but an acknowledgement of her and of our relationship. She also told him it would not make sense to include his daughter since there is barely any relationship there with me and her. \n\nHe puts this all on me though and he said I should have reconsidered since I knew my mom was now married and had a stepchild.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700064335, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17vwvlb/aita_for_asking_my_mom_and_sister_to_dance_with/", "score": 823, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It caused a shitstorm with his side of the family but I don\u2019t regret it for one second! \n\nDave needs to get over himself and keep his ego in check. I do hate this whole \u201cI\u2019m the man of the family\u201d thing! \n\nIt might be worth attempting a gentle convo with your step sis though to try and explain it to her as I can\u2019t imagine Dave will be doing a brilliant job of that if he\u2019s so butthurt. \n\nOut of interest, is step sis included in any other way? Is there a role you could give her to feel included? Although you\u2019re not close she may look up to/admire you more than you realise.

You're allowed to dance with those closest to, who you were raised with/by.

I do feel a bit bad for the 14 year old, it probably does hurt her feelings, even if you aren't close. These types of situations are a no-win; either you have to do things in a way that aren't special to you to spare others, or they get their feelings hurt (real or imagined).

I think if a father is not there, the bride can choose whoever she wants to do that \"first dance\" with her; I was at a wedding where the bride danced w/her brother, for ex. Her stepfather wasn't upset about it. He'd married her mother when the bride was in her 20s, so he wasn't any kind of father figure to her.", "NTA. Fuck Dave he is just proving he is unworthy.", "NTA and Dave isn't your dad so why does he expect to do this old fashioned dance thing with you? He can do it with his daughter when she gets married.

Absolutely chills down my spine. Congrats & dance to your hearts\u2019 content.", "NTA - Dave didn't raise you at all so why would you have him in a fatherly role? That just doesn't make sense. You were already basically grown when he came around. There's no reason to include him, unless you just really wanted to. And you were already grown and presumably moved out by the time his daughter moved in so there's really no relationship there, so again doesn't make sense to include her in the dance. \n\nAnd I just want to say Kudos to your mom for standing up to him.

The wife was by me as I did pictures. As the second song started she joined her husband, and pulled his dad back so the three of them danced for about half the song.", "NTA. Dave is confused this has nothing to do with your mothers relationship with him or his daughter, it is only about your relationship with your mother. He clearly needs to be reminded that he didn\u2019t enter your life until you were nearly an adult, and therefore he and his daughter had nothing to do with raising you or shaping you as a person. His daughter is old enough to recognize that she doesn\u2019t need to be the center of attention at a wedding for someone she barely knows. And if she has a problem with that, Dave needs to parent her, not attempt to manipulate others into giving her to her self-centered attitude.

He is within his right to feel the way he does but not to try to guilt or manipulate you to change your mind or demand to have his daughter in this special dance.  This wedding is about you and your fianc\u00e9.   \n\nBy simple calculation from your post, you were already 22 when his daughter moved in to live with everyone? (25 - 3) If this is the case, then I don't really see how Dave could think that you and his daughter would have had anytime to really bond.  Dave moved in when you were 17, still not much time for a bonding experience as you are transitioning into a young adult.\n\nCongratulations on your wedding!!

It was all about his ego.\nI would have replied.\n\"Dave you may be the father figure in your small family but you were never a father figure to me, I had my mother for that which is why I ask her for that honor.\nThe three of us were so close for such a long time I also included my sister in that.\nI understand you're upset for what could be multiple reasons but It is my wedding and I didn't even need to explain this to you.\nMe and your daughter hardly have a relationship as it is and by you pushing so hard like this on my day you're only pushing us further apart. From where I sit it only looks as if you want to be a part of it even if I don't include her but my relationship with you both is the same. Maybe one day in the future we can work on establishing a relationship but you moved in when I was 17, I was an adult and was no longer looking for a father figure as I had just that in my mother. I hope you can understand that this isn't me making a stand against you or your daughter but giving my mother and sister the honor they so rightly deserve and it would be incredibly selfish to take that from them especially my mother who earned it %100. I would be more than happy to lend a branch and maybe spend some 1 on 1 time getting to know sister better but this dance is for the 3 of us and what we have been through together. I hope you're grown enough to understand where I am coming from because I want no drama at my wedding and if thats all you have to offer then I'd kindly ask you to decide if you should really come and burn bridges you won't ever be able to build again. I hope I can count on having you both there because I do think we should get to know eachother better as you and daughter are so important to my mother but during a big life event is not the time to assert dominance over the family. If you continue to cause more arguments or more stress for me, my sister and mother then I will take that as you will not be attending and revoke the invite. I will speak to daughter on our own about things because I believe shes old enough to have these discussions with me and if things go well I hope you will allow her to come celebrate with us all. This is all I have to say on the matter but please have her text me with a time and date that will be suitable. If you decide you think you should be there then that's fine but I would ask you to give us privacy to speak freely so I ask that you sit at a further table.

Or if your sister has a very significant other, that person can take over dancing with her at that point and your husband can come dance with you. If your sister does not have someone like that in her life, then have your husband be announced and come out to dance with you and your sister together at that point.

Dave wants credit where credit is not due, he wants to be the big hero who is the man of the house when he's not and isn't. \n\nTradition says father daughter dance because it was usually the father that loved, supported and raised the daughter to be the woman that she is (misogynist ideology of she's worthy to be taken by her husband because dad made her respectful and obedient). That clearly has been done not by \"I'm the man respect me dave\" but by her mother and her sister, they have been a trinity of love and support for each other and that I'd what this dance represents OPs husband to be saw this, he agreed with it. I wonder if step sister really has an issue or like many teens felt left out, was hurt by it but actually understood the reasoning behind it and us ok with it but, shock horror still has the right to be upset about it but isn't making it an issue but dave is because HE is butt hurt that he's not included and isn't being made out to be the great hero of the family he thinks he is.", "I was thinking the same thing. Or after the mother daughter sister dance have a secondary full family dance that includes both groom and brides families (even extended/step) so they can feel included in the celebration while not taking away from mother of the bride being honored as she should be.", "You are spot on!  It\u2019s the kind and mature way to move in this instance.  Bride will have the wedding she wants, but her mom that she cares so much about will be hurting her husband, stepdaughter, and marriage.  Mom might end up single again.", "This is what kindness looks like", "I agree with this.  If I were Dave, I would make sure to protect the feelings of my 14 year old daughter and not force her to attend the wedding.", "Have her as a \u201cjunior bridesmaid\u201d or usher or something?", "Just because op doesn't see stepsis as her sister didn't mean stepsister doesn't idolize op.  This might be the first time stepsister misinterpreted the relationship.  I can see that being devastating.", "You make it sound like being a single mom is a communicable disease and we should be in awe of the \u201cheroics\u201d of men willing to put themselves \u201cin harm\u2019s way\u201d (LMAO). Like marrying a single mom is some sort of charity work ffs \ud83d\ude44", "You bring up a good point. While they aren't close it's a good idea to talk to the step-sis and explain that it's to honour her mom for raising them well past the youngn's age, not to dismiss her in any way. Dave's a dick but the kids just bein a kid. It's the talk Dave should be emotionally mature enough to have with her but that's clearly not happening. She doesn't \"deserve\" an explanation but it'd be a good faith gesture", "Its called MAMA BEAR POWER- heightened motherly instincts when dealing with intruders in her den. Very rare and very handy. NTA", "Yes it can be.  \n\n\n... and instead of helping his daughter through it, or trying to mediate the situation like a real parent would, Dave chose to throw a mantrum.", "I would happily date a single mother!  I\u2019m saying there are a lot of asshole men who say they wouldn\u2019t.", "*mantrum*\n\nFirst time seeing this word, I'm dying \ud83d\udc80", "The bar is so low for men. That doesn't make Dave a saint or ANYTHING. \n\n\"Just because you fuck my mom doesn't mean you're any kind of father figure for me\"", "You don\u2019t deserve praise for not shunning single moms. Men who do that deserve every critique they get, but neutrality isn\u2019t special.", "You reek of misandry."]}
