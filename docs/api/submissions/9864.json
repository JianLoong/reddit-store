My mom won't abuse my son, but she will and is abusing me.\n\nShe refuses to give any guidance to my son but will call me at work so I can do it, in his eyes. Mom = bad, she's the rule making although she does play games with me. Grandma = Good, cool Grandma who doesn't know how to hold a controller but she'll let him have control to do whatever he wants.", "I'm not yelling at you. I am pointing out that your mom is an asshole and she was abusive and still is abusive. Her behavior is not better. What exactly do you think letting her near your kid accomplishes? It doesn't fix your childhood. It doesn't honor your dad that you are saying she actively harmed. Is this what you think he would want? \n\nWhat are you trying? I didn't say you were abusing your son. Do you think you owe someone that hurt you and hurt your father? You don't.", "I am confused. You are scared of daycares being unsafe for your child but not your abusive mother that is still abusive. If she says that to you, what do you think she is saying ABOUT you to your son? I think you made a good choice in going to a daycare and that you should cut that woman out of your life. YOU are responsible now for the toxic people you let your son be raised around.", "NTA, and FFS, your mother is such a drama queen. Tell her she's behaving like a silly child, then ignore her.", "NTA", "Tell mom you need reliable care for your grandson because last minute cancellations have caused severe stress.  Mention that your son will benefit from the changes by being around other kids. She will benefit also because now she can have her shoe delivery and other necessities of life lined up for her convenience while seeing her grandson for grandma time.\n\nYour neighbor may have reached a point where he wanted to be free of babysitting responsibilities but knew you needed the help. His cutting out last minute is a symptom of that with him and grandma. \n\nProfessional childcare seems a natural next step at this juncture.  Hopefully, you will get to know some of the other parents over time and become friendly with staff if you make the effort.  That will help you have people who form a network around childcare that may be good when you need a babysitter down the road.", "Why do you even need to ask? Given her record, I'd think the better question is are you the asshole for allowing her unsupervised access to your son in the first place. But NTA regarding the topic in question.", "YTA for putting your child in the hands of a known abuser. Yes, you have cameras, but it is still not an excuse - a camera will show you if abuse occurs, but it won\u2019t ensure it doesn\u2019t happen. Not to mention if she takes him out in public, you have no idea.\n\nAll your comments are showing you deflecting the blame for that terrible decision by wanting to \u2018not fail your dad\u2019. Sorry, but even if he hadn\u2019t passed away, he isn\u2019t as important as your son. You allowed your son to be at risk because you want to make your deceased father - who previously abused you - proud. \n\nPlease keep your mother, who is still abusive, away from your son. Get over the fact she won\u2019t put him in a corner, and her supposed memory loss of raising you. It is manipulation, with the intent of weakening the bond between you and your son, making you out as the bad guy and her as the saint. \n\nOr, flip side, she is overdoing the \u2018too kind to be mean\u2019 act to cover for any abuse already being done by her, so if your son complains she has an excuse ready: \u2018I can\u2019t even send him to the corner, of course I didn\u2019t do x\u2019. \n\nNo idea, all I know is that you and your partner are both the AHs for putting your son into the hands of an abusive person so freely and comfortably.", "YTA.  You left your child with someone who abused you as a child?", "I have, she ended up messaging me like 9 times then I just hit mute. \n\nI need some space.", "I was in the same frame of mind when it was time for us to put ours in daycare in Vegas. Had the same experience where a couple I was looking at had multiple kids walk out unnoticed.\n\nI highly recommend Creative Kids, specifically the Torrey Pines/Hacienda and Alta/Town center locations. The Torrey pines location is the best and the Alta is a close second. Both directors of those locations have been at this for multiple decades and the staff turnover is fairly low so you'll get consistency there.\n\nOh, and NTA obviously.", "She didn't forget, she's doing what all abusive parents do and gaslighting you. It's textbook abusive behavior, she has not changed, and she should not be around children.", "A TV? What kind of daycare has a TV?", "That's what jumped out at me!\n\nOP, bad parents very seldom make good grandparents. NTA for taking your son out of her care, but honestly, he should never have been in it in the first place.", "I was reading the emotionally abusive and manipulative messages and behavior from OP\u2019s mom, and wondering why for the love of little blue marbles OP ever even considered exposing her child to this abusive person.", "I seriously appreciate your input! I will definitely give those places a call and ask for a tour, I'm glad I'm not alone. I know I overthink things but god it feels like everyday on the news something happened X daycare.\n\nI was honestly under the impression my son could start school this year but he is 4 and his birthday is in December. One more year....", "Usually daycares work very similar to the way schools work. They will give you a form to fill out listing everyone that can get your child in the case of an emergency. If/when someone comes to get your child other than you or your husband they will check their ID and make sure it matches that list. I always called in advance to let them know that such and such will be picking up my child for X reason today. \n\nTheres also usually a sign in/out clipboard at the front entrance. But there should be no problem whatsoever with your husband dropping him off and you picking him up. I hope it all goes well and he has a blast and makes lots of friends and enjoys his teacher! Good luck!", "Bot?\n\nBot", "No problem and feel free to message me if you have any other questions or want to pick someone's brain that's been through it once already. Happy to help.\n\nIf you do check those creative kids locations out you can tell them Riker's dad sent you.\n\nI also noticed your posts about your housing situation. Start school zone shopping now and try to be moved into the area of your top pick by next summer. CCSD is not great so you kind of need every edge you can get. Oh, and be prepared because registering a new student sucks big time, though I'm finding this seems to be fairly universal across the country.", "My sister and I both went to Vegas daycares and I'm looking at daycares and preschools now. \n\nYes, there are horror stories but there are horror stories about schools and colleges and other stuff as well. \n\nYou can use care or sittercity to find someone for the same price as daycare and they come to your home if you're that worried but most daycares don't put kids in front of TV's and Vegas daycares aren't any worse than anywhere else. If you're really worried, get a daycare in summerlin or higher up in Henderson like anthem or seven hills.", "Thank you for the advice, I appreciate it!", "You keep pointing out you have cameras and saying that your abusive towards you mom won't abuse your child. Do you think abuse is only physical? It's not. You may be able to see on camera that your mom's not making him pick out a switch to hit him, but you cannot monitor all her interactions with him. You won't know if she's verbally/emotionally abusing him and he won't be able to tell you that either becuase that kind of abuse is insidious and he's a small child. You are truly opening your child up to risk by letting your mother take care of him. \n\nYTA", "It sounds like your Mom isn\u2019t done abusing you. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your mother is still abusing you. It's just emotional and verbal instead of physical. Cut her off and go NC so your poor kiddo isn't exposed to that anymore.", "NTA, but just block her. Let her play the victim to a blocked account.", "NTA and quit thinking your mother will change or acknowledge any abuse, let alone apologize.  It will never happen, her brain sounds hard fried.  Keep visits supervised, she may snap, as she is not stable. In a good daycare, child will want to continue playing, is happy when you arrive.  If child is sitting alone and sad, don't go back.", "NTA you do what is the best for you children, you do not need to justify anything. Child care facilities are trained to care for your kids. I have no idea why you would leave your kid with your mum who abused you. You need boundaries with her, she shouldn't be speaking to you like that.", ">She should be grateful I'm giving her a chance to be a grandma after how her and my dad ( RIP ) abused me growing up. \n\nI can't really give a verdict here - your mom is obviously AH but I don't understand how you're so nervous about putting your child in daycare and instead choose to have him looked after by someone who ABUSED you as a child.\n\n>I just can't believe she made me pick out my own tree branch to get spanked with but she now draws the line at asking a toddler to go in a corner.\n\nAlso this. Would you rather she had made your son pick out his own tree branch rather than her calling you at work?\n\nKeep your child away from her.", "INFO\nI'm so confused, you were more comfortable having your mother who abused you watch your son than putting him in daycare with licensed professionals?", "Nta but as someone with a very similar mom. Run unless you need help under an emergency do not let her watch your child. Trust me do not! She may act that way but she won\u2019t be any better with your child and will not take accountability with her actions if she does abuse hin", "NTA, but if she excused/ignored the abuse that happened to you, she will do the same with your kid. \n\nObviously can\u2019t tell you what to do, but your baby isn\u2019t ever safe in an unsupervised environment with your mom.", "/r/raisedbynarcissists", "Seems abusive to me too.  I am sorry for the situation you are in, but maybe seeing that daycare is beneficial beyond just the reliability factor makes it a little better."]}
