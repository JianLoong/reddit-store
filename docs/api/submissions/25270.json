She was my stepmother for 20 years and a very close maternal figure to me. In 2018, while married to my stepmother, he began an affair with a married woman (new wife). He paid for dates using my Stepmother's credit card (Stepmother was the bread winner). After a year, my brother (38 M) kept seeing them out together and told my Stepmother. My stepmother confronted father about it.\n\nFather told me they were breaking up for my stepmother being controlling, did not mention the cheating at all. Stepmother left due to the cheating.\n\nFather says he will not remarry. This woman moves in with him, but father doesnt tell anyone. When I ask about it, he mentions that his \"friend\" moved in. This is fall 2019.\n\nNov 2022 father tells me he is making my sister (40 F) the POA and does not want to remarry.\n\nApril 2023 I visit father after not seeing him for 5 years (I have been paying for school out of pocket and didnt have the funding, and he made no effort to visit me out of state). I saw a missed call from \"Wife\" on his phone. I asked him if he got married to the woman, and he said yes.\n\nThey were married March 2023. They didnt tell anyone. We had dinner with my siblings and he didnt tell them then, either. I confront him about this during coffee the next day, he assures me he is making my sister the POA and that this is what he wants.\n\nIn Aug 2023, after talking to father's sister (my aunt who is 65 F), we did some background research on New Wife.\n\nWhat we found:\n\nShe has been married 5-8 times before, most marriages lasting under 1 year. She goes by several different first and last names. She doesn't talk to anyone in her family, her children and grand children don't talk to her. In 2019, she lost her license and refused to cooperate with the court for some legal trouble she had. This woman has no job, no completed education, is not attractive, is 50-100 lbs overweight (my father, before meeting her, was always super active and hit the gym almost every day, never saw him smoke or drink before, and now my father is drinking, smoking, and has a beer gut).\n\nI asked him when we were going to get my sister set up as his POA and he texted me telling me he never agreed to that. He told both my sister and me that separately that was his plan. I am convinced it was his new wife that texted that, and not him.\n\nI told father this yesterday, he claims he already knew everything.\n\nThis woman has now convinced my father to sell his property (valued at 1.2m) and move to another state away from all his family. He is convinced this is a good idea and will not listen to anyone otherwise, even though his children and his sister all are warning him about how stupid this is.\n\nAITA for not wanting a relationship with my father's new wife?", "created_utc": 1692719072, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15y9l5z/aita_for_not_wanting_a_relationship_with_my/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s not a good situation for sure but I think cutting off contact  with them isn\u2019t a good idea . Leave him the option of talking to you.

She helped him cheat on his wife, encourages unhealthy habits in him, and is isolating him from his children.", "NTA. Your father is being scammed. She is going to take him for everything and leave him penniless, dead or both. Someone should take measures to protect him from himself. She is isolating him from his family and moving him far away so he can be more easily manipulated and dependent on only her.", "He had a heart attack at age 70. He didn't tell any of his children and the only reason I knew was because my aunt told me. When I went out to lunch with him and New Wife in April 2023, he forgot his wallet so I had to pay for us (I wouldve done that if he asked, but he just forgot his wallet, which is weird). He previously was a business owner (contractor) until fall 2022 when all his contract employees quit to go work for a competitor due to my father running the company poorly and not paying people well. Despite this, he claims he is in perfect health and is mentally as sharp as a tack. \n\n>There is no reason to have a relationship with this woman.\n\nShe apparently has epilepsy, is what he told me yesterday, and is completely dependent on him. No one in the family thinks he should be with her and none of us want anything to do with her. It's bizarre. She is 20 years younger than him, but it's not like she's an instagram model. She's very unattractive and my father has been described as a DILF at least before he met her and got out of shape.", "Thank you. Any advice on how to emotionally deal with this trainwreck?", "May i suggest making an anonymous tip to adult protective services \n\nThis woman to me seems like a con artist esp with the different names and going after an vulnerable older man", "My father had Alzheimer\u2019s but was under the illusion that he was perfectly fine. I remember one birthday where he boasted \u201cmy memory has never been better\u201d. Next thing he asked who my 5-year old son was and why we were all here. It\u2019s a common symptom. Patients think they don\u2019t have a problem and the rest of the world is becoming more and more unreasonable.  Looking back he had problem with remembering things way before we realized what was happening. Constantly lost his wallet, had trouble finding his car, getting lost, being late ...  Btw, my dad\u2019s new wife made him sign a new will even though he wasn\u2019t all there at that point. Don\u2019t let your dad\u2019s wife swindle you out of his money. If he does have dementia, you\u2019re going to need it for his care.", "If your father stays in contact with your aunt (his sister ?) it may be the best way to keep tabs on him.\n\nAsk her what she thinks of  his cognitive state.", "Honestly, you've already done everything you should have done. You let him know your concerns, he dismissed them. Now he has to live with the consequences of his choices. If you haven't already invited him to your wedding, simply don't send him an invite. He didn't even tell you he got married, so.... tit for tat. Let the women who raised you attend. It sounds like she actually wants to continue fostering a relationship with you. \n\nI would just walk away from the situation and continue blocking the new-wifes number. If your dad wakes up from all this one day and decides to rebuild a relationship with you then you will have the choice to forgive and let him back into your life, or to ignore it. But ultimately I would just let him make his choices and lie in the bed of his choosing. Attacking his new wife any further is unlikely to help the situation so just cut your losses and live your life.", "OP\nThe answer to this depends on what your goal is in terms of your father?\nIf you are worried about his mental acuity and want to protect him. Walking away and isolating him, may make him feel like she is his only ally.\nStaying in touch with him, will be beneficial in the long run.\nI have no opinion on who is the AH. Based on my own experience, when our parents get to these ages it becomes a difficult transition of watching them decisions that are not the best while at the same time navigating the beginning of the transition where us kids have to step in based on what we are seeing while the parents continue to expect the 'I am the parent' deference.", "Hmmm. I'm going to look into this. Thank you.", "He may have vascular dementia after the heart attack . You should have a medical assessment carried out on him at this stage .", ">If you haven't already invited him to your wedding, simply don't send him an invite. \n\nWe haven't set a date yet, so no sweat there. That's a good idea. Instead of letting him know, I'll just not bring it up.\n\n>Attacking his new wife any further is unlikely to help the situation so just cut your losses and live your life.\n\nThank you for the feedback. I appreciate it and will think about this."]}
