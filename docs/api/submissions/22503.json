My wife also has a 19-year-old son from a previous relationship.  My stepson and I have a pretty good relationship.  His dad is and always has been present in his life, but my stepson currently lives with my wife and I.  He dropped out of college after one semester due to mental health issues.  \n\nHe has struggled with anxiety and depression for 3-4 years and was doing better before leaving for college.  But I think being on his own for the first time triggered some setbacks and he struggled a lot before making the decision to come home.  He currently works part-time, but spends pretty much every other waking moment in his room.  \n\nWe worked together with his dad ever since he first started showing signs of mental illness.  Therapy, counseling, working with multiple doctors, multiple drug combinations, etc.  For probably 18-24 months, pretty much all of our parental attention was focused on him and his issues because they were effecting everything and everyone in our family.  \n\nWhen he was away at college, I finally felt like I could actually be a present and active father to my 3 other kids.  I hate to put it this way, but I really felt like I was trying to make up for lost time.  I also finally felt joy from parenting again, which hurts to say but everything with my stepson was so stressful and progress was so slow.  I finally felt like I was actually watching my kids grow up instead of missing out on everything.\n\nNow that my stepson is living at home with us again, I've tried really hard not to stray away from focusing my time and energy on my younger kids.  I've tried to include my stepson in any outings or activities we're doing, but the few times he's decided to join us, it's been noticeably less enjoyable for everyone.  I don't like saying it, but he can be a complete joy-suck.  He has a tendency to not allow anyone else to enjoy something if he isn't.  So, I pretty much stopped inviting him along to things.  \n\nBoth he and my wife have noticed and my wife called me out on it recently.  She told me that he feels left out and wants to be included more.  I reminded her of how he behaves when out with the family and told her that unless he changes his behavior, I'm not going to allow him to ruin things for our younger kids.  \n\nShe told me that he needs a strong father figure to help him through these hard times and I reminded her that he has a father who can fill that role, but he doesn't want to live with him because his dad would require him to work full-time and contribute to the household as an adult, something my wife doesn't want to do.  \n\nI told her that I am through letting him suck all of our time away from the younger kids and I will continue to prioritize them over him.  I told her that I would never ask him to leave, but that he's legally an adult and I have 3 young kids who require my time more than he does.

Especially if everyone has to walk on egg shells to keep the struggling one in the fold.  \n\nI would schedule some 1:1 stuff like breakfast or chicken wing night with your step son Something simple and 1:1 to catch up. Very low pressure too. Kid does need a father figure but he also may just need to get out of the house, change scenes, and try some stuff.  \n\nIf it's depression- he may not have the right meds yet.

Or he should at least be told how his behavior impacts the rest of the family and their time together. That is completely unfair to the younger kids.  I agree with a lot of these other comments and the mom sounds like an enabler. There is a difference between supporting a child through a hard time and allowing them to be stagnant. \n\nI am also the oldest and was struggling with mental health through highschool. I had a few hospitalizations, tried some medications and went to many therapists. I know I was not very fun to be around when we did things as a family and really wasn't expected to do many activities. My parents were very supportive despite me being unpleasant at times. However, they always tried not to take away from my younger siblings. It's always a little uneven when one child has unique struggles but the other kids deserve to get all of their needs met too. This is even more true now that he is an adult. \n\nI am almost 20 now and had my own setbacks after starting university. My grades dropped to a d/c average and I was really close to dropping/getting kicked out of school. My real improvement came when I started to actually help myself. My parents and I had the agreement that I could continue living at home for free as long as I was in school and helped with chores. If not I was expected to pay rent. I was given expectations in a way that felt like me and my parents were working together, not like I was being berated or disciplined. I started becoming an active participant in treatment, taking on responsibilities, stopped feeling sorry for myself, and learned how to properly communicate and handle my feelings rather than lashing out on others. \n\n I'm no longer living with my parents, I am still in school and working. It's work but it feels so rewarding to know I can take care of myself and the independence has definitely improved my mental health. That is not to say I'm magically this 100% stable person with no issues left to work through but I am no longer on medication and would say I'm doing well for my age. I wouldn't have gotten here if I didn't have the push to truly grow up and be an adult. \n\nI hope my experience and perspective can help your family in some way.\n\nEdit: added somethings to clarify my opinion.", "NTA.

It\u2019s unfair to your other kids that so much attention is placed solely on one child. And honestly, the older they get, the more they\u2019re going to notice that.

I'd explain to him that basically, hey you do realize you ruin the vibe, let's work our way up to having you hang out more with smaller outings, and if you start ruining things for the kids I'm going to pull you aside and call it out.

But wallowing in it only makes it worse. When I struggled, I did everything in my power to not let it affect my friends and family. I avoided certain situations, I tried not to trauma dump on them, and I never let my struggles dominate anyone else's life.\n\nYour stepson is doing the opposite. It is not your three younger children's responsibility to sacrifice their time with their parent to soothe his depression. I'm sorry, but it's just not. He can't monopolise three parents. Your children may have revelled in his absence and in your additional focus on them. It's wonderful that you don't want to take that away from them. And frankly, children who are neglected emotionally because their parents have to focus on another sibling have their own struggles. They need you, and it sounds like you're the only present parent they've got.\n\nYour wife isn't helping her son, she's enabling him. You're right that he needs to change his behaviour to be less selfish during family outings. I know firsthand how hard it is to see beyond yourself when you're in pain, but that's life. He has to put the work in, not let other people do the work for him.

Those things can HELP depression, but clinical depression (which needs proper diagnosis) is caused by real chemical imbalances in the brain. They can be triggered by external factors (stressors, losses, etc), but many, many people simply have brains that do not create or respond to the right balance of neurotransmitters.\n\nFor those with innate chemical imbalances, meds can be necessary and lifelong. They may not be needed long term, and the right \"mix\" may change over time as the brain grows and changes.\n\nEven for people with external causes, a short course of meds can help them do all of those things you mentioned in order to help get back to long term, healthy brain function.\n\nMedications for mental illnesses are no different than insulin for diabetics, thyroid supplements for Hashimoto's Disease, or any other supportive medication to correct something wrong with the body. Clinical depression, and other mental illnesses such as Bipolar Disorder and schizophrenia, have real, physical causes. They are not \"cured\" by touching grass, getting more sun, or making friends.\n\nAttitudes like yours kill people by creating stigma around treatment for mental illness.", "I am very social, work outside, exercise every day, take my vitamins, and dedicate time to my hobbies like playing piano, learning to knit, and spending time with friends and family.

Your stepson is sick so he\u2019s not going to view this situation the same way you do. To him, this is just another example of how the world is letting him down. There\u2019s nothing wrong with not wanting him to hog all do the attention but at the same time you can\u2019t ignore the possibility that your decision could have a negative impact on his mental health. Would his therapist be willing to do a few sessions with you, your wife and your stepson? Maybe if you were all able to express how you feel, you could come to a resolution that helps everyone. Even if he wouldn\u2019t agree to that you should at least try to talk to his therapist about  what you\u2019ve decided. She may not be able to reveal what\u2019s in her notes but she can give you a general idea of whether your approach will be effective.", "Would he be willing to go to family therapy with you as well? Or something that would help you guys create a better dynamic to help him?", "NAH\n\nAs someone who has multiple mental health issues I totally understand why it must be hard for him to enjoy outings completely and why he probably likes/feels better in the moment when he isolated himself. But I also know how that goes against literally every professional advice I've had in the almost 20 years since I've been dealing with my illnesses. So to me purposely excluding him could be detrimental not only to your relationship with him and your kids' relationship with him, but also to his progress. It's also important to remember that while he's a legal adult, emotionally and physically he is still a teenager. He's still a kid.\n\nAll that being said, mental illness does not excuse behaviour. He obviously shouldn't be mocking you or activelly trying to ruin everyone's day.\n\nMaybe try again to talk to him and explain how that makes you and your kids not want him on your next outings, and maybe promise not to pressure him too much to participate if he's said no. Just going out and seeing new places and spending time with people can be so beneficial to someone struggling with mental health, so it's important to push sometimes, but gently and not too much pressure. I can't say I understand how a parent of someone struggling feels since I don't even have any kids, but to me when people pressure me too much to interact when I'm having a really bad day it does make it so much worse.\n\nI do think maybe you're just feeling overwhelmed too, and that's 100% valid! But from the little you've said in comments and the original post I don't think this kid should go live with his father, if that's how he's acting about the situation. One or two years can unfortuatelly be very little in the grand scheme when it comes to things like mental health. It can be really hard to find the right balance of meds and therapy, and it can take multiple years for someone to feel good again.

They don\u2019t fix the cause you\u2019re literally just numbing yourself (also subjecting yourself to a whole list of possible side effects) whilst lining the pockets of the pharmaceutical industry. The percentage of people with lifelong brain chemical imbalances is absolutely tiny. Most of the time people are struggling with the emotional aftermath of some type of trauma or other event that has impacted their sense of self worth and self image. Mostly the cause can be found in childhood. Sometimes people are not looking after their brain. If you abuse your body it will break down - same goes for the brain. Abusing it with unhealthy thought patterns and poor lifestyles or addictions can send you in a downward spiral very quickly. Since he didn\u2019t develop issues until age 15/16, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say his brain is broken. He appears to have a caring family. It\u2019s possible his school experience was negative in some way and he\u2019s dealing with that. But depriving his brain from natural sources of feel good chemicals with his current lifestyle is 100% going to fuel and feed his poor mental health.

In order to be able to do these things, I take painkillers sometimes. The painkillers don't treat the underlying problem- but they do get rid of a major barrier in the way of me being able to do the things that DO.\n\nLikewise, it is very hard to function enough when in a state of depression to do things that address the underlying causes of depression. Exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and healthy human company, as well as life improvements like education, getting a better job, getting out of abusive relationships, etc. ARE beneficial for treating depression. But finding the will, energy, and strength to do these things is a lot harder when you are continually being drained by emotional pain and stress. Even if all meds did was to take down that barrier of pain for a bit, and give a depressed person time to recover and rebuild their strength and energy - and that is not in fact all they do, but it is one thing - they would be a godsend.", "Ah yes, medication just covers symptoms and doesn't actually fix anything.

His reasons for not wanting to live with his bio dad make me seriously question how much of his \"problems\" are true mental health issues and how much is not wanting to grow up and liking the power he has to manipulate others.
