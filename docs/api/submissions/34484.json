For the past I\u2019d say 8 months my bf has become very interested in UFC (mma? idk what to call it). He gets up at like 3AM to watch fights and often has play fights with his friends one of these friends are important in this situation (I\u2019ll call him S). We had a very large group of friends,we all graduated in summer but we all kept in touch over summer until now. Now these play fights or \u201cspars\u201d as my bf would say were all fun and games but they actually led my bf to believe he could actually fight because S (who says he does mma) said he\u2019s naturally good. \n\nThis led to a massive ego and he said he wanted to have a actual fight, and one of our other friends dad owned a gym with ring and he said he could let him fight there (idk if that was even legal). S proposed a guy for him to fight and it was a guy back from school I\u2019ll call A. S was friends with A(not close friends) and I knew A because we used to sit next to each other in class. S said he\u2019ll try get a hold of him. A agreed, shockingly. \n\nWhen A agreed I did express some concern to my bf (multiple times) and he didn\u2019t listen. A was a quiet guy, but as we sat next to each other for a year I knew probably more than others about him, he was pretty much just one of those traditional masculine males in a physical sense, worked out 6 days a week, rode horses and did archery, owned large dogs but was one of those guys that looked intimidating but was actually a nerdy and friendly guy. My bf didn\u2019t like A or A\u2019s friends, and neither did the rest of the boys in our friends group. I always questioned my bf on this as A had literally never even spoken to him, and my bf used to say it\u2019s because A is so arrogant and thinks he\u2019s so good looking, this led to a lot of arguments with my bf, because why did my bf care if other women were attracted to A when he had me?\n\nNobody knew if A could fight but S said he told him something about he had been training in some form of martial arts. The whole build up to this my bf was acting so childish, he\u2019d constantly try insult A in a group chat that was made and A wouldn\u2019t even open them 90% of the time and I dont think he responded once. When the fight came along there was only one outcome from the start,  A was visibly towering over my bf, and he had clearly bulked up. On top of that, turned out he could fight, my bf lost in i\u2019d say 90 seconds. \n\nAfter it I didn\u2019t bother consoling him, I berated him because I expressed my concern multiple times and he picked not to listen to me. He said I\u2019m an AH because I should support him unconditionally if I really loved him. He now wont speak to me, because he says I embarrassed him in front of his friends while he was vulnerable. Part of me feels bad but I feel like he needed to hear the truth.", "created_utc": 1704580771, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/190ccru/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_he_deserved_to_get/", "score": 427, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You tried to reason with him every step of the way, with no avail. Some people have to learn things the hard way. Watching UFC and wrestling with the boys doesn't make him a gladiator, no matter how much his friends fed into it. If you berated him in front of his friends after the loss, that was assholeish. The ass kicking was enough embarrassment at that point. He didn't need you to pile on in front of them. That should've been a private conversation later. Hopefully, this ego thing was a one-off thing. Otherwise, I can't imagine having a mature relationship with a person like this. Hopefully he learned his lesson.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend clearly has some underlying confidence issues that should be addressed. He seems to either be extremely cocky or needs to be constantly complimented\n\nYou expressed concern and made it clear you didn\u2019t approve and didn\u2019t support him in terms of actually fighting. He should understand that you could train professionally for decades but when it really comes to fight or flight you can freeze.

Just on a recreational basis, but my gym has produced some regional and national champions.  If your BF has never had any training other than some backyard sparring with his untrained friends, he's lucky he didn't get hurt a lot worse by fighting an actual trained fighter.  He is very, very lucky he came out without getting a dislocated joint or something in his face (orbital, nose, tooth) broken. Or especially since he was disrespecting his opponent, he could have overcranked a joint lock and snapped a bone.\n\nAlso, I don't know any kind of responsible gym owner that would just take some untrained clown off the streets and allow him to fight.  He's lucky he didn't get it some real trouble.  I have to suspect that your friend's dad runs some two bit MMA promotion and fed your BF as a tomato can to one of his prospects.\n\nIn any event, your BF was dumb enough to get into this situation. I kinda sorta get his idea of your supporting him and all that.  But would he want you to support him if his simple ass wanted to stick a fork into a light socket?  He did something really dumb and he should be thanking his lucky stars it didn't go worse.", "If someone challenges you to a MMA fight, they are either really good, or full of BS.

Hopefully your BF learned what a \u201csetup\u201d is and won\u2019t fall for that again. S and A will laugh about this for a *long* time. \n\n18yo dudes, especially ones with egos wanting to fight people, *need* to be humbled. He\u2019s acting like a baby now because he can\u2019t handle his first real ego bruising. He\u2019ll be fine, but the demand for unwavering and unconditional support is juvenile. You\u2019re not his mother. You\u2019re good here.", "ESH \n\nYour bf sounds like he was looking for an excuse to bully and fight/humiliate someone he didn't like. He Fucked around and found out, and you are right that it sounds like he deserved it.  This side of him generally sounds unpleasant and mean. He's definitely an asshole.  \n\n\nBerating him in front of his friends after just losing the fight.... that wasn't necessary and could have happened in private later.  Kicking someone you love when they are down is also an asshole move.", "INFO: how did you \u201cberate\u201d him? Was it right after the fight at the gym in fromt of everyone?", "NTA\n\nAmateur fighter here. You really get a huge piece of humble pie when you step into a martial arts gym, and unfortunately, the average guy that doesn't train never gets to experience this. Your boyfriend just got a huge wake-up call of how much he actually doesn't know how to fight and had his ego hurt. \n\nHe's probably embarrassed that he got beat up in front of you and his friends. Give him some time.", "NTA, but it's kinda drifting in the direction of ESH.\n\nThis would be NAH if your bf wasn't being a knob to A before the fight. BF overestimated his abilities in the ring, substantially -- he's not the first person to do so, he won't be the last, and sure, it was fair that he got humbled.\n\nBut your BF isn't an AH for being stupid. Thinking you're a good fighter when you're not isn't morally wrong in some way.\n\nYour BF _is_ an AH for insulting A, and for saying that you should support him unconditionally. Insulting is obvious, but asserting that you owe him unconditional support feels weird, and is giving me controlly-domineering vibes.\n\nBut anyway, moving on to you. You're not an asshole for telling your BF that he deserved to be humbled, but the point of having a partner is that the two of you are a team, there to support and love each other, right? You don't owe your partner unconditional support, but it sounds like you weren't going to support him in most scenarios here anyway.\n\nYou're not an asshole for checking his ego, but I think there's a broader question you should ask yourself of why you're with your BF. Do you actually want to go through life with him, do each of you actually want to support each other's endeavours?\n\nSticking with someone you don't love or want to support, just for companionship or to avoid having to deal with being single, _is_ an asshole move; it's arguably deceitful, and certainly denies one's partner the ability to find a partner who loves and supports them (unless folks involved are poly).\n\n---\n\nThat said, I'm assuming here that you didn't actually _berate_ him, that you're using that as a figure of speech. If you dragged him out of the ring and started emotionally abusing him, then yes, ESH.", "ESH, but I definitely get your point. \n\nIf someone can\u2019t change something about a decision they made, there\u2019s not a lot of good in saying \u201cI told you so.\u201d\n\nYour BF sounds like someone I wouldn\u2019t want to hang out with because of the weird jealousy of a person he doesn\u2019t even know thing.\n\nPlot twist - you should break up with your bf and date A because A sounds like a decent guy.", "ESH\n\nYour boyfriend telling you \u201cI should support him unconditionally if I really loved him\u201d is super trashy and guilt trippy. \u2018If you really loved me\u2019 should never be said, and in this situation it sounds like his feelings were hurt. You also warned him repeatedly, told him it wasnt a good idea, and that you didnt support it. He also talked shit to the dude in the gc which is rude and just bad sportsmanship.\n\nYoure an asshole for berating him, especially if you did it infront of people. (Not saying you did but if you did thats messed up) Theres better ways to say \u201cI told you so\u201d without yelling at someone and making them feel worse than they already do.", "What do people feel they have to say? I told you so. Your boyfriend just got beaten down in 90 seconds and if that wasn't bad enough you had to jump in and say I told you so. And then you wonder why your boyfriend gets mad.\n when you get humiliated it often leads to be angry and upset and embarrassed. And then your girlfriend says in a roundabout way I told you. So.

Based on current information and knowledge. \n\nI know that isn\u2019t in line with what everyone else is telling you, but I feel like bias is playing a large part here, as well as unknown details. Yes, your bf was an arrogant fool. Yes, he acted childish. Yes, he set himself up for a much larger fall than necessary. Yes, it is concerning that he pushed it as far as he did and allowed it to culminate in his and your current situation. Yes, he needed to be humbled.  \n\nYet, I still see you as the ahole. Why? Because you, his girlfriend, one of the few persons in someone\u2019s life that is supposed to have their back and stand in their corner, openly berated him in front of his friends. Ignoring any other potential witnesses like if A or other spectators were present, you cut this man down in front of people that he hangs out and socializes with. And why? To make yourself feel vindicated because you were right and he didn\u2019t listen? Because it seems to me if you were expressing your concerns and warning your bf it would have been to prevent him from suffering, but then you went and added to that suffering eagerly and opening.  \n\nYou do realize that he didn\u2019t do anything wrong to you, short of not taking your advice and warnings as seriously as he should have, right? He didn\u2019t hurt you, he didn\u2019t make you into a fool. All he did was get a little over zealous and allowed it to get to his head. Which, he paid the consequences for. I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret too, almost every young man does the exact same thing, just many of them don\u2019t do so in a fighting sport. Gaming, traditional sports, drinking competitions, literally any competitive activity you can think of has had thousands of people who get it in their head that they are better than they are end up getting humbled real quick.

You\u2019ve been acting a bit arrogant and fighting isn\u2019t a game, if you are going to continue this then you need to actually train.\u201d Or some variation that lets him know gently that you warned him, but it was out of care and concern.  \n\nI\u2019ll admit that his dislike of A is slightly odd and concerning, but it could and likely does boil down to envy or jealousy. That\u2019s his problem 100% and he needs to address and fix it. That being said \u2014and I\u2019m not trying to push every little issue here onto you I\u2019m just exploring potential details that might exacerbate his dislike\u2014 so you mention A or bring him up occasionally/ frequently?
