{"id": 25644, "submission_id": "162hhja", "title": "AITA For Refusing To Be Friendly Or Acknowledge My Sisters' Ex?", "selftext": "Throwaway Account\n\nI (24f) am one of five children and the youngest of the three girls. My older sisters \"Donna\" (30f) and \"Laura\" (28f) both dated \"John\" (31m) at one point of time and our family had to endure the drama of it all. Donna dated John first in college but broke up due to conflicting goals for the future. A couple months after the break up, John showed up at a family event as Laura's new boyfriend.\n\nLaura insisted that nothing physical happened while Donna was with him, and that since Donna claimed to be over the break up there shouldn't be an issue. I called b.s.. There were obvious shouting matches and tears but Laura insisted that she and John were in love and our parents eventually caved when Laura announced her pregnancy and proposal.\n\nI was completely on Donna's side in the beginning and kept my distance from Laura but everything blew up when Laura caught John and Donna together while she was pregnant. Laura's body was obviously different and John claimed that he wasn't attracted to what she became. I was disgusted with him and confused with what to do about my sisters, so I just kept my distance. It was rough for the family and I don't think Donna and Laura will ever be close again but it is what it is. John is the father of my nephew so my parents and other siblings had to at least pretend to be nice.\n\nJohn still gets the obligatory invitation, but no one really wants him there. I don't know why but for some reason John has started taking an interest in trying to talk to me. He'll always try to go beyond the polite greeting with me and I just try my hardest to get away. John got ahold of my new phone number and claims that he only did it because he wanted to make sure he could be in contact with everyone who had frequent interactions with his son and has tried to friend/follow me on social media.\n\nI want this guy to leave me alone but he's not getting the hint. At the last family event that he came to he kept trying to talk to me and would follow me around a little bit. I gave him one polite greeting and then kept giving him the cold shoulder. Eventually, he cornered me and asked quite loudly why I was being so rude to him. I told him the truth. I don't like him and how I will always think less of him for his role in my sisters' estrangement. He stormed off and I've been getting messages from my mom, my aunt, Laura, and my grandma that it was rude, and how I owed it to my nephew to apologize to his dad. John has stated that he will accept an apology in the form of a home cooked dinner at my place. But I don't want to do that. AITA?  \n\n\nEdit: Okay I've been checking the answers but to answer/clarify a few things I just wanted to say this.   \n\n\n1. My mom, Laura, and my aunt agree that me cooking for John isn't unreasonable but do not support it being a one-on-one private event. \n2. My brothers do not like John and have on more than one occasion wanted to have a \"talk\" with him but my mom and Laura have mostly kept them at bay because if something were to happen John would press charges. \n3. John cornered me in the living room on the couch in front of the women in my family. The men were outside drinking beer. \n4. My family's is from the American South, so my mom, her sister, and my maternal grandma operate under that \"Southern Hospitality\" mindset and believe all women should be polite, hospitable, presentable, and tactful rather than being direct and causing a scene. \n5. Laura and John were engaged at the time and while nothing has been officially called off John refused to marry into a family where he feels he isn't welcomed or respected and that's why he gets invited to stuff.

You\u2019re NTA, in case it wasn\u2019t already obvious.", "Totally NTA.\nHe's a sleaze bag and a creep. In the context of it all, the words  \"home cooked dinner\" made me feel ill.It's got nothing to do with hospitality or apologies. \nI get bad feelings about this creep. Keep a brother handy and learn karate or similar.", "NTA - that dude is a fucking creep!!!\n\nI don't blame your family for trying to keep things civil for the baby's sake but honestly, your sisters need to stop stabbing each other in the back over some waste of skin and oxygen that was literally trying to bang their other sister while they were fighting over him, have some respect for themselves and each other, and kick his ass to the curb. By all means let him be a father to his kid but he is clearly an utter dog (not to mention creepy and moderately stalkery - an apology in the form of a meal? Wtf?!) and doesn't give a shit about either of them.\n\nI think if you had just straight blown up at him and said you didn't like him then you probably would have been more Ah-ish but you didn't, you tried to just keep things civil and polite until he practically stalked you and you had to tell him to fuck off. He left you no choice (plus he's a total dick trumpet, cheating, sleezebag) so yes, you definitely had the patience of a saint and are not the asshole.", ">John has stated that he will accept an apology in the form of a home cooked dinner at my place\n\nJohn will accept whatever apology you allow him to have it and will feel lucky to get any after messing up the relationships between everyone in the family. \n\n>John cornered me in the living room on the couch in front of the women in my family.\n\nI hope to God your brothers know about this, because THIS is the time to have a talk. \n\n>I don't know why but for some reason John has started taking an interest in trying to talk to me.\n\nJohn wants to score the third sister. That's what he's after. \n\n>My mom, Laura, and my aunt agree that me cooking for John isn't unreasonable\n\nJesus Christ, this is absolutely unreasonable. You have nothing to apologise for. What has HE ever done to apologise to your sisters and the rest of the family? I get \"Southern hospitality\", but he didn't do anything to deserve it, quite the opposite. \n\nNTA, but get your brothers in your corner, OP. \n\n\n>John refused to marry into a family where he feels he isn't welcomed or respected\n\nHe worked very hard for that!", "The family is for sure part of the problem.", "My favorite part of this thread is that she said her Mom and Grandma are both encouraging her to cook for John.  \n\n\nWe know Donna and Amanda suck, but honestly this whole family sounds terrible.", "Maybe she should make Minnie\u2019s Chocolate Pie!", ">Where are the brothers in all this!?\n\nThey do no like John at all and on more than one occasion they wanted to knock him out but were stopped because that could lead to charges. It is only at the behest of Laura and our mom that they keep it civil.", "There is nothing that John can do to seduce me. Not only is he not my type but the idea of being with someone who's already been with a (blood) relative grosses me out. Fine for other just not for me.", "My girlfriend kept hounding me to take Krav Maga so I'm now three weeks in and I got my first \"First Amendment Right\" present at 18.", "What a creep", "A romantic dinner for two  by candlelight \ud83d\udd6f\ufe0f with a violinist \ud83c\udfbb playing in the background \ud83d\ude02", "Again. Your entire family is toxic. John is not the only problem here.", "Happy cake day :)", "yoo happy cake day homie \ud83e\udd1d", "Your family is also gaslighting you. Or at least the other women seem to be.", "I agree that violence is not a good idea. But I'm amazed, that the women in the family won't listen to the men who obviously see John for what he is.", "I would hope not, he sounds repellent! \nMy worry is more that he's trying to coerce/force you,  so sticking to your current method of staying as far away as possible and not being alone with him is a good idea", "Like on one of those trashy talk shows \"Guess who's backstage!\"", "That almost happened more than once but my mom stopped them because if things got out of hand someone would be going to jail.", "But your mom is ok with you serving yourself up on a silver platter with a homemade meal for this creep? Wow.", "Soo what are your thoughts on moving to a less backwards state and never talking to any of these people ever again?", "Yeah, I'm imagining a typical traditional Southern dad getting in the guy's face by now, maybe \"casually\" mentioning his shotgun collection....", "I have been applying to jobs in another state but so far I've gotten nothing so I'm stuck where I'm at for the time being."]}
