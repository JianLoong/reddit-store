You are sick and you don't work and you can't be around people due to illness/social anxiety (fair enough) but you frequently run to bars (crowded presumably)  and stay there long enough to get drunk. Who pays for that if your partner has to work two jobs to pay for your medicine? Why can you go to bars but not work or be around people?", "She is telling you an accurate picture of your future unless you make changes, get therapy, and take responsibility for yourself. Lots of people are sick and needing support and don\u2019t ruin their SO\u2019s entire life", "i don\u2019t doubt that will happen one bit.", "Oh I see it now, thanks for the correction."]}
