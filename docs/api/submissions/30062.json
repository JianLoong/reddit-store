{"id": 30062, "submission_id": "17ky8my", "title": "AITA for telling my daughter she needs to get over me grounding her as a teenager?", "selftext": "When my daughter (now 26F) was 17, I left her home alone for a week while I was on a business trip; while I was away, she threw a party behind my back which ended with her and her drunk, underage friends trashing a significant part of the house inside and out. All told, they did a few thousand dollars in damage (including two broken TVs and damage to the car); the place looked like a warzone, or the aftermath of a bad teen movie. So, I told her she would have to pay me back, and that she was grounded until she did; no electronics outside of schoolwork, strict curfew, no friends over and absolutely no more parties, and she had to get a part-time job to start paying off her mistake.    \n    \nI wanted to teach her to take responsibility for what she'd done, and that meant no exceptions to the rule. It isolated her from her friends, I admit, but that was the consequence. She hadn't paid me back by the time prom came around; she tried to persuade me to let her go, but I was firm. She was basically grounded right up until she moved out.    \n    \nThe thing is, she's basically resented me ever since. It feels like we haven't had a single pleasant conversation in nine damn years; she refused her college fund because she didn't want anything from me (she chose not to go to college at all - she went full-time at her job after HS); and even now it feels like every other conversation we have is her complaining about her senior year and how unfair I was. I've tried getting her to understand it was her own consequence, that I did it because I love her, the works, but she's still convinced it was all just me being awful.    \n    \nWhat's really brought things to a head is that recently her and her boyfriend had their first child. I've offered to help with anything they need, but I've been rebuffed at every turn, and when I asked if they were sure my daugher blew up on me. Apparently I'm not allowed to see my own granddaughter until I \"accept that how I treated my daugher is wrong\" and apologise for grounding her and forcing her to miss prom; my own kid told me that until I did that, she didn't trust me to look after or even be around her child in case I treat them \"the same way\".    \n    \nI told her that was enough; that of course I'd never be cruel to a baby or young child, that the punishment she earned was appropriate, and that she needed to accept she ruined her own damn senior year by being immature and doing things behind my back. In response, I got a long text from her and another from her boyfriend about how I'm an asshole and apparently I \"haven't changed\", and how I'll never be in their kid's life now. I've been talking about it with some close friends since, and while some of them are on my side, others have said I was too harsh on my kid at the time and that she's allowed to be upset. I've also had angry messages from some other family members about it, as well as some of support; it seems everyone's picking sides now.    \n    \nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1698794063, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ky8my/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_she_needs_to_get/", "score": 185, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was basically grounded right up until she moved out.  \n\n\nINFO (really this is me just being curious): Was it *actually possible* for her to pay off the bill before prom? As in, between school and responsibilities and her part time job?", "Nine years later and she's still pissed off?\n\nThat makes me wonder if there is missing reasons here. She turned down going to college so she wouldn't have to be financially dependent on you. She hasn't accepted any help for the baby from you. That's not really something done lightly.\n\nWas she working and trying to pay off the money when you stopped her going?\n\nUltimately this post is about accepting consequences. You did what you did and this is the consequence. You don't have a right to be in your daughter or your granddaughter's life.", "This feels like we're missing reasons. I have a hard time accepting that for nearly 10 years every problem in your relationship stemmed from a high school grounding.", "Other than her incredible lack of judgement with that one party, was she previously disrespectful?\nI\u2019m thinking she must have been a pretty good kid or you would have been a moron to leave her alone for a week.\nObviously you were pissed at the destruction, but I think you took it too far.\nIMO, there should have been some middle ground.\nCleaning the house top to bottom, a month of no electronics/strict curfew and damages deducted from her college fund might have been more appropriate.\nForcing her to miss prom (a once in a lifetime event) seems extreme .\nTVs can be replaced and cars repaired but you might have destroyed your relationship permanently, and sorry, but that is on you.", "You keep talking about actions having consequences, but refuse to accept the consequences of your own actions. It's clear that, despite what you think, your daughter is quite capable of succeeding without you, and your continued belief that she's immature and incapable is what's feeding her dislike of you.", "INFO: Was she actively paying you back but just didn't have the ability to do so in full by the time prom came around?", "YTA\n\nBy your own admission, you gave her an impossible goal to meet.\n\nYou didn't punish her. You retaliated against her. The difference is that a punishment is meant to teach a lesson. Retaliation is vengeance. \n\nYou sought vengeance against your own child by giving her false hope, demoralizing her, hurting her, and eventually, you did so much you caused her to resent you.\n\nSo much so that she's still angry years later.\n\nIt sounds like this is a trend with you. Resentment is a step away from hating you. Be aware of that.", "More info.\n\nWere you a single dad? What does her mother have to say about the situation? There seems to be other underlying issues for this to have gone on for 9 years.", "ESH.  I'm a pretty strict parent compared to other parents I've met.  However, I would have bent a little on the prom thing because it was a major milestone in your daughter's life and she was actively working to pay you back.  By trying teach your daughter a lesson, you taught her to hate you.", "YTA. You are absolutely right that actions have consequences. So what was the consequences of her actions: 1. $ few thousands financial damage. 2. She broke your trust. Your task as a parent was to teach her responsibility and force her to fix the consequences.\n\nLet start with financial compensation. There was absolutely no problem with your solution of forcing her to get a job to pay that debt. It was also possible to take money from her college fund and tell her that she needs to get a student loan for this particular amount of money. Also it was possible to sell some her gadgets to cover part of costs. You can see, that when we talk about financial side of question, I offer you the solutions that affect only that part of life.\n\nNow let\u2019s consider broken trust issues. What would be a reasonable punishment for that? Imo, month or two grounding, forbidden parties at home, limited number of parties the next half a year, and so on. What is important here that she suffers from her bad actions, but in a reasonable way that teaches her not hurt her.\n\nSo what you did? You\u2019ve already admitted in the comment, that it was impossible for her to fulfill your conditions before the prom. You purposely destroy her social life for entire year and force her to miss one of the important events for teens in her age. What was your purpose? I don\u2019t know. OP, for example, legal system work entirely different way: you know the consequences of your actions IN ADVANCE (literally, if I do X the will be consequence Y). SHE DIDN\u2019T KNOW AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPECT SUCK HURSH PUNISHMENT. So you took out your anger on your daughter and in no way it was morally justified thing. \n\nMoreover, what did you expect when punish 17 old for a year until she turns 18 and she has legal right to move out and does not talk to you anymore? Really, you demonstrated your whole power until you lost one anymore and now you are surprised that she doesn\u2019t want to have any business with you. Pikachu face, yeah.", "YTA because it literally wasn\u2019t possible for her to pay you back in time. I am all for teaching responsibility, but suspending her life until she pays bad a considerable amount is uncool. By all means ground her for a period and make a plan to pay you back. But it cannot be indefinite", "It's a tough one, and I'm not sure that you meant badly, but I do have to go with YTA on this one. I think that some people are going to agree with you, but that's going to be the terminally online portion of this subreddit who think the question is \"did I have the right to do this?\" not \"did doing this make me an asshole?\"\n\nWhile what she did was definitely bad, it's something that happens. Teens have parties, and things get out of control, and based on the way you talk about you going on a business trip and your daughter having a college fund, you did have the money to cover it. Making her pay it off is fine, grounding her is fine, but making her pay off the full amount WHILE fully grounding her and basically preventing her from having any fun whatsoever is kind of draconian.\n\nWhen a parent punishes a child, the point is to correct the behavior. Anything past that is excessive, and I think you could've easily made your point without making her live essentially like a prisoner for a very long time. Something like 2 months of grounding in addition to paying off the damages probably would've been sufficient, but the amount you did it feels more vindictive than corrective.\n\nThe fact that you're not acknowledging how she feels does make you the asshole, and the fact that you're more concerned about not admitting any fault than you are about trying to mend your relationship with your daughter makes you even more of one.", "Honestly I was all set to defend you until I saw your comment that she wouldn\u2019t have been able to pay you back before prom and I\u2019m wondering how long you knew that. Was that something that didn\u2019t become obvious until prom, or did you know that for a while? Either way, taking away such a big milestone without trying to come up with some kind of compromise wasn\u2019t okay. I also saw in a comment that she wasn\u2019t allowed to do anything fun until she\u2019d paid you back. Making her get a job to pay you back: fine. No parties or friends over: fine. Not doing anything fun and no prom: absolutely over the top, you took away her social life AND her biggest milestone to date (though being THIS angry well into her 20s is a bit over the top too). But also, you left a teenager home alone for a week. That doesn\u2019t excuse her and her friends trashing the house, but I hope you don\u2019t think you\u2019re totally innocent in what happened as a result of leaving her alone. You made a lot of poor parenting choices her senior year, which led to her building up a lot of resentment. Keeping you away from your grandchild is a little extra but you have to understand that you set her up for a miserable year and don\u2019t even seem to care. ESH", "ESH You went nuclear with your punishment, now she is. She dealt with her hand, I think now it's your turn. I do hope you both can have a talk and fix this, though. Good luck.", "YTA. I agree with having her pay back for the damages, but youset an impossible task for your kid by not letting her do anything until the whole thing was paid. You should've had incremental steps back to normalcy, instead you gave your kid a no-win situation and now refuse to acknowledge the damage that did. She messed up, yes, but I would honestly argue that you messed up far worse. Now your kid gets to punish you, and the shoe isn't so fun on the other foot, is it?", "YTA. Let\u2019s assume minimum was $10 per hour post tax at the time (which it wasn\u2019t) she would have to work 120 H a month to pay it off in time. WTF is wrong with you?", "I'm going to give you some unsolicited advice: Parents tend to judge themselves by their intentions; children judge their parents by *results.* I've found that this is often the root of disagreements over what counts as fair. And this is important! Good intentions don't necessarily lead to good results. You can try your best and use your best judgment and *still fail.* Heck, most parents rely much more on gut instinct and \"common sense\" than any sort of science-based parenting! I'm not a psychologist or anything, so I could be wrong, but at the very least that's the crux of why I disowned my parents and they could never understand why.\n\nYou two can argue over whether the punishment was fair or not. I don't think it was, and I'd call you an asshole for it, but I also don't think it hugely matters here. If I'm reading this right, it sounds like you pushed to be in contact with her granddaughter and help even after she refused the first time. YTA for that. She isn't obliged to get over anything, either. She's allowed to judge you for your parenting by whatever standard she pleases, and YTA for insisting she has to accept that you were right. If nothing else, I encourage you accept that she's allowed to have feelings about your parenting and hold you responsible for your choices. Respect her right to decide these things for herself. Don't try to push her to agree with you.", "INFO: how old was she when she moved out?", "Consequences - You wanted to teach her that if she behaved in a manner that displeased you, a proper punishment was reduced social contact - Now your behaviour when you did that, in turn displeased her.\n\nSo now she's punishing you the way you taught her, by reduced social contact, you should be pleased, she apparently took her lesson to heart.", "How was she making money? As a part time student? So she was probably making minimum wage, yeah? And she was to be grounded until she paid back everything? Thousands of dollars worth? Plus, she'd be grounded until it was paid off?\n\nI get paying you back and taching her a lesson. But the length of the grounding seems a little excessive. An entire school year, and then some? You basically made her a social outcast, and didn't let her enjoy one of the biggest (for her at the time) and most important moments in her life?\n\nI don't know any kid her age that wouldn't have done or wanted to do the same thing as her and move out and cut you off. Is it right that she's still upset, who knows. Did you help her develop the proper coping skills to deal with what she went through, or did you tell her to basically suck it up and get over it? Probably not, since she gave up schooling that would be paid for and would have given her a leg up on life. She took the hard road so as not to have to deal with you. You obviously affected her more than you think/know. \n\nYTA. Sorry.", "Info: How long was it between when her punishment started and when prom happened?", "YTA here, a punishment was deserved for what happened but it really appears you took things too far. She missed at least one coming of age event with the prom and hurt her social relationships as well during a time when socialization is really important. As you said through the post she suffered the consequences of her actions, why do you think your actions should be consequences free? This really sounds like in 20 years when you're old and alone you will still be wondering why your kid wants nothing to do with you. Congrats enjoy the consequences or your actions.", "Well well well.\n\nIf it isn't the consequences of your own actions. \n\n\nYou left your daughter to her own devices for a week and punished her for a long time very harshly when she couldn't handle the responsibility. \n\n\nNow she punishes you for a long time, very harshly because you couldn't handle the responsibility of being a good parent. \n\n\nShe destroyed your living room, you doubled down and destroyed her last year in high school. Now she doubles down and destroys your years as a grandparent. \n\n\nWhat did you expect? You certainly taught her not to let go of one's grudges. \n\n\nShe learnt from the best, didn't she? \n\n\nYTA.", "Yta,  I say this as a mother of teens/20 somethings.   If she needed this level of punishment at 17,  you screwed up long before,  or you were always way to unforgiving and as a result she\u2019s legitimately concerned for her child.   \n\n\nCompletely isolating a teen from their social support system, making them miss a huge milestone they can never get back, a goal of payback that she couldn\u2019t possibly meet without dropping out of school is way too much.    Grounding for a month,  cleaning everything up,  paying back within 12 month,  sure.", "YTA. For all the reasons everyone already explained. I can't believe you did that to her. That punishment was definitely disproportionate! She's right to resent you, and I wouldn't trust you to take proper care of my newborn either.", "YTA. Paying back is totally fine, a few weeks or even a month being grounded is fine too. But do you really think, that you wouldnt resent someone who is supposed to love you making you a social outcast and loner (which propably also affected her mental health) and spitting on the first big milestone in your life for a few thousand bucks? \n\nBut the question is, what to do now, if anything is possible anyway. I mean she was grounded till she moved out meaning she left knowing her mother still resented her for one fuckup month ago over money and propably filled with resentment herself because your punishment destroyed her social life, mental health and first big milestone. In those month have you ever given her the feeling that you actually loved her like a daughter?  Have you ever made an honest attempt to mend that. The way you write seems like you just treat it as nothing big. \n\nI would suggest family therapy, because you both need to get a lot out of your system and a neutral party in that would help so you can both voice what you have to say without it escalating. But I doubt she will give you that chance after that text. Why would she, you havent even realised what trauma you put her through as you have shown, by still insisting this punishment was right.", "So in your comments you admitted that it was NOT actually possible for her to pay off the damage before prom despite trying hard and working 16 hours a week? And you knew that?! You set an impossible goal for her, it seems to me you did it out of spite to have a reason to destroy a year of her life.   \nYTA a million times!", "YTA. My mom said I wasn\u2019t allowed to go to my prom my senior year because she didn\u2019t think I would have the \u201cstereotypical movie\u201d prom experience and \u201cwanted to save me from the hurt\u201d but that wasn\u2019t the prom I wanted anyway. I ended up devising a plan with my friends and my aunt to get me to my prom. I went and had the best night ever and she didn\u2019t find out until maybe a month or so after. She was mad of course and I was grounded but we got over it. Mostly. We\u2019re both sad she couldn\u2019t help me pick my dress and help me get ready or take any pictures. It took her a long time to realize that that was her fault. I had a great time with my friends and took loads of photos. It\u2019s mentioned once in a bike nowadays, 11 years later, and honestly there\u2019s still some bitterness on my side. \n\nTLDR she did something majorly stupid and yes deserved punishment but senior prom is a special event for girls and taking that away hurts and creates lasting scars", "YTA \nI\u2019m all for people experiencing the consequences of their actions but there\u2019s a difference between letting your child experience consequences and vindictively punishing them. But whether the punishment was fair or not isn\u2019t really the issue anyway. Your daughter is trying to tell you that you hurt her. The appropriate response would be to listen and empathize and apologize (when appropriate- and in this case, I think it would be). I would also apologize for dismissing her feelings for so long. Without doing that, I don\u2019t see how you could ever hope to repair your relationship with your daughter.", "YTA.\n\nYou left an underage child home alone for a week. You then gave her a punishment you knew would mean missing out on most of her senior year and a goal you knew she couldn\u2019t achieve. You placed her consequences over her social life, school work, and future academics.\n\nYou set her up for failure. Your daughter hasn\u2019t spoken kindly to you for years and you don\u2019t have any regrets. You haven\u2019t even acknowledged that while you thought what you did was right at the time that it was never your intention for it to affect her this severely. \n\nYou wanted your daughter to know actions have consequences, that people need to work hard to make it in the world, and that all the work and effort possible sometimes isn\u2019t enough to make things right.\n\nShe learned everything you wanted her to learn. Why are you upset?", "YTA, you want to talk about responsibility? Who leaves a minor alone in a house by themselves? Sure, she was old enough to look after herself for a little, but you took off and left her for a *week*? You don\u2019t know much about being responsible do you? Some things you only get once, such as senior year and prom. You took them from her over one mistake and frankly the goal you set was most likely impossible. You dangled her freedom over her head, knowing she couldn\u2019t get it. Frankly, with how far she\u2019s taking this, I think there\u2019s more you\u2019re not saying. Let\u2019s have the whole story, please.", "YTA.  The punishment was excessive, because it wasn't possible for her to pay it back while basically doing nothing but school and working for what sounds like several months at least, and instead of reflecting on this at any point years after you no longer are responsible for disciplining her, you insist it was justifiable.\n\nYou made the justification that you \"did it because \\[you\\] love her\" but that doesn't smell right; it was a punishment, not a consequence or a lesson.  There should have been some financial (as well as social) consequence to her, no doubt, but the fact that it was basically an unpayable debt makes this excessive.  As a side note, I didn't go to prom, so I don't have some attachment to it as an institution.  However, at a time when many young people (who don't have to work to financially contribute to actual family expenses like food, rent, etc.) are saving to pay to go to college, move out, have a vehicle, or otherwise transition into life, she was making payments on an unpayable debt based on one bad decision, while being isolated from friendships, as a minor child, until she could get out of your house.  You could've stopped this punishment halfway through without losing your point, and actually it would've made it more effective, because as you see now, all you have done is alienate her.", "ESH\n\nActions have consequences and sometimes people don't like the consequences.\n\n>I wanted to teach her to take responsibility for what she'd done, and that meant no exceptions to the rule.

She was trying and as long as she was going to continue to pay for the damage she should have been able to go to prom. She isn't going to get that night back. She was already without friends because of all this and chances are there's friends she'll never see again or has grown apart from since high school ended. You took away a very important night from her. Ultimately, she still did it to herself. So.. everyone sucks.", "YTA. There are consequences and there is going nuclear. Guess what you chose? You admit you isolated her from her support system, of course she resents you. You admit you ruined her senior year by enforcing no outside activities. You admit that she had no prom or social life. But consequences, you say. And you are correct, now face the consequences of your own actions.

Discovering alcohol too. Get relieved that party happened in your home and not in a creepy nightclub, the risks would have been on another level. Maybe she knew her friends well and was more caution than you think, more or less consciously.\n\nBut most of the time, everything is cleaned before parents come back, and they never know it happened. Your daughter is not lucky at all.\n\nAlso, most of the time, youngsters don't destroy their parent's place, but by preference someone esle's parents place, and most of the time at the most dominated by the group...

Cleaning is the punishment. And also because most parents did the same mistake when they were young, and most of them know it's a \"baptism\" in youth culture.

All told, they did a few thousand dollars in damage (including two broken TVs and damage to the car); the place looked like a warzone, or the aftermath of a bad teen movie. So, I told her she would have to pay me back, and that she was grounded until she did; no electronics outside of schoolwork, strict curfew, no friends over and absolutely no more parties, and she had to get a part-time job to start paying off her mistake.    \n    \nI wanted to teach her to take responsibility for what she'd done, and that meant no exceptions to the rule. It isolated her from her friends, I admit, but that was the consequence. She hadn't paid me back by the time prom came around; she tried to persuade me to let her go, but I was firm. She was basically grounded right up until she moved out.    \n    \nThe thing is, she's basically resented me ever since. It feels like we haven't had a single pleasant conversation in nine damn years; she refused her college fund because she didn't want anything from me (she chose not to go to college at all - she went full-time at her job after HS); and even now it feels like every other conversation we have is her complaining about her senior year and how unfair I was. I've tried getting her to understand it was her own consequence, that I did it because I love her, the works, but she's still convinced it was all just me being awful.    \n    \nWhat's really brought things to a head is that recently her and her boyfriend had their first child. I've offered to help with anything they need, but I've been rebuffed at every turn, and when I asked if they were sure my daugher blew up on me. Apparently I'm not allowed to see my own granddaughter until I \"accept that how I treated my daugher is wrong\" and apologise for grounding her and forcing her to miss prom; my own kid told me that until I did that, she didn't trust me to look after or even be around her child in case I treat them \"the same way\".    \n    \nI told her that was enough; that of course I'd never be cruel to a baby or young child, that the punishment she earned was appropriate, and that she needed to accept she ruined her own damn senior year by being immature and doing things behind my back. In response, I got a long text from her and another from her boyfriend about how I'm an asshole and apparently I \"haven't changed\", and how I'll never be in their kid's life now. I've been talking about it with some close friends since, and while some of them are on my side, others have said I was too harsh on my kid at the time and that she's allowed to be upset. I've also had angry messages from some other family members about it, as well as some of support; it seems everyone's picking sides now.    \n    \nSo, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That amount of money would make some families homeless. She owed you and she\u2019s being ridiculous and spoilt.", "YTA\n\nI think you went in with good intentions but you took it way too far, you say in a comment she was working 16 hours a week to pay you back alongside school and homework plus any extracurriculars. Assuming a 7 hour school day that's 50 hour work weeks without the homework at 17.\n\nI don't see any possible way she could have paid you back before prom without burning out completely it's almost like you set her up to fail.\n\nThe fact that she still harbours this much resentment towards you should show you that this genuinely affected her. In all honestly the biggest issue you have now is dismissing her for 10 years that's gonna be hard to forgive.", "After reading all your comments, I have to go with YTA. I A totally understand your reasoning, and I'd have been harsh too, but depriving her of prom especially is pretty rough. Be harsh, make her pay you back, but we as parents need to be reasonable as well.", "YTA this is too punitive for too long. And it\u2019s caused her trauma and ruined your relationship with her.

It was her who didn\u2019t pay off the while debt before prom.

Then I got to nearly your last comment. You admitted that given the amount she was earning, the amount to be paid off, and the amount of time before prom, it was *impossible* for her to pay it off by then. That is called \"acting in bad faith\" on my book, making YTA.\n\nProm is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It should have been an exception. Or you could have had her do things around the house to \"pay\" some of it off to give her a chance to get it paid by prom. What she did was wrong. She violated your trust and did serious damage to the house. The rest of the punishment \"fit.\" This did not.\n\nYou absolutely owe your daughter an apology. I don't blame her one bit for still being mad or for withholding access to your grandchild. If you truly give a damn about your daughter, apologize *now*. And keep apologizing on a regular basis for a long time because you should have done it years ago.", "YTA\nYour daughter was in the wrong for the part and 100% deserved punishment, however you claim\n\n>I wanted to teach her to take responsibility for what she'd done,\n\nShe was taking responsibility, she got the job and was paying you back the money. You've admitted that it was literally impossible for her to make the money needed to pay you back in the time limit set even with her giving you her entire check.\n\nYou're also fixating on the prom, but that's not the whole issue. You've got to think back to the entire four months and how you treated her. Did you treat her like your daughter or was she just that irresponsible teen that trashed your house?", "You might have gone overboard with the punishment. Also, it\u2019s been 10 years and your relationship has not improved? Maybe there are other reasons she\u2019s upset. YTA.", "YTA, look I get it she threw a party and you needed to punish her. But you essentially took away a significant part of her senior year of HS ( no electronics outside of schoolwork, strict curfew, no friends over and absolutely no more parties) and you even said that it isolated her from her friends! It seemed you were much more into the idea of consequences being punishments rather than having some consequences acting as learning experiences. Obviously this is a very privileged problem to have, but a $4800 bill (that you presumably could pay without any significant financial hardship) as a trade for the culmination of your kids high school doesn't seem like a fair trade off to me. Grounding for a month, even a few weeks could've gotten the same message across. I get why you did the punishment, but I also can completely understand why a teenager would be pissed that their senior year was taken away for a mistake that lots of teenagers have made", "YTA. You admitted yourself it was an impossible goal that isolated her and made her miss out on a milestone. No wonder she wants nothing to do with you.", "Yeah... YTA.\n\nYou gave your daughter reasonable consequences for having a party: grounding, helping to cover the cost of damages. You said yourself it was impossible for her to pay you back in the course of her senior year.\n\nYou *also* admit you completely isolated her. You couldn't even permit a single night to go to prom, essentially the only major rite of passage for a high school student. You think this completely reasonable, because you wanted your daughter to understand what prison is like? Even prisoners get some leisure activities.\n\nHas she told you it's this specific incident she's holding on to? This single thing? She snubbed a college fund, got as far away from you as possible the minute she could, clearly doesn't even like speaking to you... that's more than a simple \"mom grounded me\" response.\n\nI feel like you're leaving a lot of your relationship dynamic. Even if you're not, completely isolating your child for a year is beyond cruel. Answering her with \"that was your consequences, so fuck you\" when she tries to talk to you about it is even worse. You're clearly incapable of seeing it from her perspective, at all, and if you're willing to just write off your child, she's probably right to keep you as far away from her life as possible.", "YTA... get ready for no contact life.", "As you said, actions have consequences. You expected a teenager to be a responsible adult. Yeah, she needed to be punished, but you have to understand that some things only happen once. Prom only happens once. Walking your daughter to the altar only happens once. You took a once-in-a-lifetime event away from her and all she learned from it is that she can't trust you. You're not the asshole per see, but you should learn to live by your own rules. She doesn't trust you to take accountability for your own mistakes too.", "NTA\n\nWhether or not you went overboard on the punishment, she needs to get over herself and move on. What a stupid thing to be hung up on.", "YTA. You left a teenager alone for a week. You share some of the responsibility for her misbehavior. Your punishment was overboard and hurt her relationships.", "YTA you set her up to fail and I\u2019m guessing her dad isn\u2019t in the picture so you took out your anger on her \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t of been able to pay back before prom. And you knew that when you set the punishments", "YTA You left your SEVENTEEN year old daughter at home alone for a week? What did you think would happen? She must have been responsible and trustworthy, or you wouldn't have done it. That said, a week is a very long time to give a teenager to make at least one idiotic decision. This is really mostly on you.", "YTA and now you\u2019re learning about consequences too.\n\nYes what she did was bad. But you were the parent. She was a teenager. Instead of coming up with a reasonable consequence that would teach her about responsibility, you chose to go with an unreasonable punishment that was guaranteed to permanently ruin your relationship with her.\n\nYou prevented her from going to prom. You interfered with her social development. These kind of things have long term psychological impact.\n\nYour job as a parent is to educate and help your child grow. Not to mete out punishment. You took it way too far and now you are paying for it. Was it really worth it?", "YTA since you acknowledge she wasn't going to make enough before prom. You should have waited until prom and if she was being sincere until that point then yeah let her go if she wasn't then no. Coming down on her like that knowing full well she was never going to pay it back before prom was just unfair.", "So I take it you've never seen any teen movies? Because leaving children home alone (Ha home alone too) leads to exactly this. Every time.\n\nStill NTA as frankly I'd have done similar, except I'd have them repair everything themselves and come out of it with a greater respect for other people's property and trade grade qualifications (not everyone is a tradie and can do that kind of punishment).", "NTA\n\nThat being said, you left a teen home alone for a week. For that and the party, you should have gone to jail. You fucked up far more than she ever did, but you have failed to take any responsibility for allowing her to make the pretty typical mistake.\n\nSo, it\u2018s time to climb off your high horse and recognize that you failed as a mother. You excelled at the grand punishments, so give yourself a round of applause.   \n\n\nThe NTA was to grab your attention only. You truly suck in this situation.", "NTA. I think she was lucky. I know my parents would have just kicked me out if I ever pulled a stunt like that. They would have called the cops and also hit me with a lawsuit for damages. I probably would have ended up in jail. \n\nMy parents weren\u2019t good people, but I would never have considered having a party like that. \n\nLots of kids from my high school didn\u2019t go to prom because they either couldn\u2019t afford it or weren\u2019t interested. A whole bunch went to a baseball game instead.", "Nta, you break it you buy it. That wasn't her property she trashed carelessly.", "NTA. Maybe you should have made an exception for prom. Or maybe if you had she would still be whining that a few months of being grounded for destroying a house ruined her entire life. I'm sorry she hasn't realized that it wasn't so much about the cost of repairs as it was about parenting-- making hard decisions, hoping that your child will be a stronger adult as a result. \n\nThe great thing about grandchildren is that they little karma time bombs. In a few years that precious baby will be a hormonal, obnoxious teenager, and your daughter will have a whole new perspective on parenting.", "YTAH. While I agree punishing her was obviously correct, the degree at which she was punished was not. You essentially forced her to become estranged with her friends and miss prom, the most important social event for most high schoolers. And then continued to keep her punished till she moved out. You made your decision and she's made hers.", "YTA. I wouldn't have anything to do with you either. She messed up yeah but that punishment was way too much. She was also a kid.", "She didn't except your college fund out of pure spite she will use that at a later date. Until she can admit this was all down to her actions things will not change its so much easier to blame you I also think she will blame you for her lack of a further education.", "I'll say NTA just based on my own experience. Something similar happened to my brother. We're very much a pro-marijuana family, but my brother and a friend of his thought it would be a cool idea to smoke weed in class while the teacher wasn't looking. It was chemistry, so he though enough other smells were going on. He was wrong.\n\nThe school called my dad, and he was livid. This was like a month before prom, and he got grounded which meant...no prom. I'm sure that sucked, but we're in our 30's now and it's all water under the bridge. \n\nIt seems like enough time has past that your daughter should have matured enough to take at least some responsibility. Barring you from seeing your granddaughter seem petty.", "Nta. Just wait and see how she handles being a parent. 18 years from now, she\u2019ll come back and apologise and you can say I told you do and slam the door in her face.

This doesn't seem like a full story to me.", "I am confused and I think this post lacks information. \n\u2014 Was your daughter a trouble maker before this? \n\n\u2014 Had she attempted to do any cleaning before you arrived home? Did she have any excuses on how the damage happened? Did you ask/listen? \n\n\u2014 Did you allow her any socialization during this period? Was she rewarded for good behavior?\n\n\u2014 Would it have been possible for her to actually pay the full balance back before the end of the year? \n\n\u2014 Did you insurance cover the damage or did you have to pay out of pocket? \n\n\u2014 Did she attempt to negotiate a less severe punishment with you during her senior year? Did you listen and did she deserve clemency? \n\n\u2014 Keeping in mind that kids do stupid, stupid things like throw parties, why do you think this punishment fit the crime? Did you physically punish her at all? \n\nBased on your post, it seems like you trusted your daughter enough to be home alone and that this might have been the first time she broke your trust. I also suspect that there are factors behind the party chaos that weren\u2019t your daughter\u2019s direct fault if she had normally been responsible and left the house looking crazy. I suspect your daughter suffered trauma outside of a shitty punishment. Find out if something bad happen to her during the party / senior year.", "YTA OP.

I don't know, actually listened to her side??", "I'm torn on this one, because I was in a similar situation many times as a teen, and I *never* let my friends break shit. That said, you admit she had no ability to pay it back and she begged you to let her go to prom, an important formative experience, and you gave her no mercy. \nThe fact that she's still mad about it even now tells me that it was very important to her, and you're still not willing to admit you may have been wrong. \nYTA.

Prom is a supervised event.  A moderate curfew could be in place.  No post-prom party unless it is a school-supervised event.  The daughter is not left home overnight or late at night alone.", "Prom is probably only 1 thing that the daughter mentioned and OP is only listening to half of the story and latching onto something that OP feels is obscure.\n\nI feel that 4 months of being grounded is over the top for something like this. Being grounded until you can pay off $4800 worth of debt, only being able to work 16 hours a week at a minimum wage job? Most adults cannot do that. Can you imagine as a teen being ostracized by your friends because you cannot do anything but go to school and work?", "When everyone else can meet and communicate outside of school and you can\u2019t, the friendship usually doesn\u2019t last long.", "I\u2019m certain you\u2019re wrong. We could go back and forth on it though. You can Google you pov and I\u2019ll Google mine. Sounds like a blast! We\u2019re here to render a judgement, not prepare for court.", "No - that's the opposite of the situation. Sorry if I didn't explain well; I took her entire paycheck each month, and then each month gave her a limited allowance for her own food etc. She was still free to eat the groceries I bought for the house, and that allowance wasn't connected to the amount she had to repay in any way.", "Hi, I graduated 12 years ago, it was illegal back then.", "I\u2019m 52, and yes, it was illegal for anyone under 18 to work full time back in the 80s\u2026", "Tf she supposed to do? She left her 17 yr old alone bc she needed to WORK, you know, the thing that pays the bills? Not OP's fault her daughter was irresponsible and couldn't pay back in time", "Yeah, it's not like she had to go to it for her job which paid for the house and car and food or anything! Oh, wait, OP literally said it was a business trip in the first sentence.\n\nYeah maybe OP overestimated her kid's maturity but that's not entirely her fault? A 17 year old can absolutely be reasonably expected to not lose their shit for a week. Teens are impulsive and have issues with decision making but it's not uncontrollable and doesn't abdicate them from all responsibility.", "Tf? My parents left me alone in high school and I didn't throw a party because I saw what happened at parties. A 17 year old is absolutely mature enough to make that decision.", "The kid was 17, not OP's fault her daughter was irresponsible", "Oh please. How many kids in high school can't stay home alone for a week without having their shitty friends over to cause thousands in damage to your property? So she missed her dumb old prom for being an idiot. Big deal.", "Do you mean... not long enough? No teenager is gunna earn 5k in 4 months working PT.", "For $5K worth of damages to the house?", "OP said that she said the punishment goes on until the damages are paid back. Did the daughter not know how long it would take to pay it back? Did she think OP would still let her go to prom even if she didn't pay everything back?", "Do you know what else is a big deal? Causing thousands in damages to property.", "The trust was about before the party. As in OP trusted her near-adult daughter to not do something so reckless and now she clearly can't trust her. Once again the several months punishment was until the damages was paid back. And it doesn't make sense that OP had to let her daughter go to prom. When you do something like her daughter did, why should you expect your parents to allow you to still go to prom? Why are so many people in this comment section losing their minds over prom?", "Torture??? Jfc get a grip. Holy shit, you have to be a teenager.", "Being grounded for four months for doing thousands of damages to you parents property isn't torture. It's weird you would equate it to being tortured. The fact you said that means you have to be Gen Z. Cause as a fellow Gen Z, we are definitely the only people who would see this punishment as torture.\n\nThe grounding was until it was paid back. She didn't pay it back in four months so it continued. If it was paid back sooner, it would've ended sooner.", "Oh good grief it is not TORTURE", "Once again, the grounding was on the condition of paying it back. So within that four months, she didn't pay it back so the grounding continued.", "Jesus, that's insane. Imagine thinking you were entitled to a *thousand-dollar spend* the same year you wrecked your mom's house!\n\nYou should change your username to \"WomenAreNarcissists.\"", "And that\u2019s the huge difference here. There\u2019s a line to be drawn when someone\u2019s actions cause thousands of damage and they are still mad 10 years later that the parent didn\u2019t spend another grand for prom.", "Not to put too fine a point on it, there was a bunch of underage drinking at the OP's referenced party. OP could easily be on the hook for over 7 felonies.", "Look if you throw a wild party and caused damage you can't pay back, I'm not gonna have sympathy for you that you can't hang out with your friends.\n\nHanging out with your friends is what got you into this mess in the first place.", "Is this a gen z thing because when I was in HS you weren't always connected to your friends anyway. I had plenty of friends I ONLY saw at school", "Gotcha. Thanks for clarifying.", "No but she doesn't have a relationship with her and she clearly wants one so she's going to have to figure out what her priorities are.", "Yeah. Because she was doing the right stuff and working to pay it off. She should have been allowed to go.", "you do you.", "The several months' punishment was extreme and excessive.  The daughter could have been held responsible for making payments on the debt without keeping her under such an extreme grounding the entire time.  A shorter period of strict grounding would have been more appropriate, and prom was well after that.  The parents should still allow her to go to Prom because denying a semblance of a normal life 4 months later is vindictive and cruel.  Prom is a major milestone event in a high-schoolers' life.  That is why it is given that level of importance.", "Why is no one in the comments realizing that prom easily costs hundreds if not over $1,000?!?!\n\nOP didn\u2019t deprive her of a class trip, or a college visit, or an interview with school admissions or anything that has a real and true long lasting negative effect on a persons future earning ability and success\u2026\u2026\n\nIt was a school dance that has been hyped up to insane levels of importance.", "According to OP herself in comments the daughter *couldn't* pay it back in four months. She was set an impossible goal and then punished for being unable to meet it.", "OP admits that there wasn\u2019t any way for her daughter to pay her off in full before prom, if that changes anything", "Bullshit. If that punishment is financial, she has no fucking right to create additional limits like grounding and not letting to work more than 16 hours per week on low wage job that interfere the main goal of pay back. \n\nThat if her daughter was, idk, 15, when it happened? 3 years of full grounding, that\u2019s your logic?", "It was an impossible task laid in front of her. That's the issue people have. Part time high school employees barely make minimum wage and less tgan 20 hours a week. It would have taken roughly 3/4 to a full year to pay that off on a part time job. And he knew she wouldn't be able to pay her back in time.", "As already stated, the debt could not reasonably be paid within 4 months.  Expecting the entire debt to be paid before the grounding was ended was extreme and excessive.  A better approach would have been to have a shorter fixed period of grounding, and then the daughter could return to a more normal life as long as she remained current on the payments.", "Your making the point that she suffered the consequences of her actions, well now OP is suffering the consequences of theirs. OP needs to stop whining about it and either apologize or accept the consequences and never see their grand kid.", "This 17 yo was left without a support system. Therapy, paying mom back and being grounded for a set period of time, not an indefinite period. 4 months? Do you understand how long that is for a child?", "She was working to pay it off because she was made to, not because she was sorry. If her \"friends\" had actually cared about her they'd have helped her out with paying for what they did.", "Honestly, let's end this exchange. We clearly have very different views and we aren't going to change the others mind. Your view on OPs punishment being excessive and my view of the punishment aligning with the damages done and the fact that the conditions to lift them not being met thus prom had to be missed are conflicting.\n\nNo matter how many replies we both comment, our views won't change. Enjoy your day", "Nobody is claiming that prom isn't expensive.  There is no point in explicitly stating the obvious.  Prom is one of the major highlights in a high-schooler's life.\n\nDid the OP allow her to go on a class trip?  Though that also has nothing to do with a person's long-term success.  I do see the issue with her refusing to go to college, but that is a separate item.", "I don't know honestly. I feel like leaving the comments. I feel like I need to get checked out if I'm agreeing that OP's punishment wasn't as torturous as its being made out to be and that missing prom after you caused thousands in damage isn't something that you should be upset about 9 years later.\n\nMy country doesn't have prom in your final year but if I had to miss the equivalent of it because of my own actions, I wouldn't still be upset 9 years later.", "It's like OP also said she didn't force her daughter to get a better paying job but the daughter could if she wanted to.\n\nIf I did what her daughter did and my mother did the same punishment, I'm trying for a better paying job. I'm hustling... especially if I want to go to prom.", "Did it take three years to pay her back?\n\nAnd did you read OPs comment properly? OP didn't force her daughter to do more. Meaning if the daughter wanted to do more, she could. OP just didn't force it. The job was the daughter's own choice.", "Agreed.  At 16 hours a week and removing FICA and possibly a little more, I came up with almost a full year to cover the debt.", "The debt could be paid off though? OP says the daughter's job and that she didn't force the daughter to do more but she doesn't say that she didn't stop the daughter from doing more.\n\nEither way. Let's end this exchange. Neither of us are going to change on views any time soon.", "Agreeing to disagree makes the most sense.", "By my accounting $7 per hour * 16 hours per week * 4 weeks per month * 11 month = $4928. So, DOUBLE (she need to pay and she is grounded) punishment for one FINANCIAL mistake for 11 months. You know, I prefer to see you as a judge for heads in mortgage securities sector after 2008 crisis.", "Exactly I can understand her being grounded for 2-3 months and for her to pay that off over time, as in the following years. But not to realistically pay him all back in less than a year.", "Agreeing to disagree makes the most sense.", "Well because you are being unreasonable. To the point of suggesting that the daughter should have worked so much she likely would have failed school to pay off the damage.\n\nGod forbid you ever have children who make a bad decision.", "By my account, she could've gotten a different job. \n\nAnd I have no idea what you're talking about. I was 6 when that happened so I can't even think of a valid experience that I have lived through to be able to relate to that example and properly respond to it.", "God forbid I have children whose version of a bad decision is throwing a party where there will be underage drinking, no adult supervision and end with thousands in damages. I hope that if I'm ever a parent, I wouldn't raise kids who think that that is okay."]}
