This is why you don't use the same sponge for surfaces and dishes.\n\nAnd yeah, it's *probably* fine and I might do it at home, but a commercial establishment has (and needs) higher standards because a 1/10,000 chance of illness will hit *me* once in thirty years and a *cafe* twice a week.", "Maybe he did, or maybe it is a window wiping tool used for windows. You know because in the story Mary clearly says it is ... Even if he didn't know it can still make people sick ignorance doesn't change that.\n\nBut even that point aside, his actions are wrong, he purposely causes drama at work, and if someone is being inappropriate at work and gossiping the appropriate response is not to through a tantrum and curse at them , you go to management or try to sort it in a common grown up manner.", "No. OP specifically says it was for the windows, and did not make any effort to find the correct item before using the window tool (which could have bird poop, soot, toxic cleanser etc on it, now being used on a area where dishes are washed \ud83e\udd22) instead. \n\nY'all are bending over backwards to pretend OP didn't fuck up.", "especially if it is the \"dirty\" side of the dish area.  Most food prep areas wouldn't have any toxic chemicals for cleaning windows because of cross contamination from the spray, so that squeegee would potentially only have something like vinegar or non-toxic residue, and would probably be safe to go through a Hobart washer.", "This ain't that hard man, it's done in the industry throughout hundreds of kitchens.\nStep 1: order a rubber window tool\nStep 2: use it to clean the dish area and nothing else.\n \nCommercial establishments order stuff for one purpose what are you on about cleaning product. You just use the tool to drag water into the sink.", "Glad we agree your cleaning product point is a bust. \n\nIt's okay to stand up for yourself from the workplace bully. They are 20 year olds in a cafe service industry environment not a office. If you find his cursing inappropriate but not the work place bullies action you are a joke.", "No, apparently you don't understand that things can be washed and wiping the area next to the sink doesn't require a special tool because... No dishes or food actually touch it!!! \n\nYeah it's not optimal but once again you have to work with what you have. \n\nAlso, do you ever eat on outdoor tables? They get bird poop and all sorts of other stuff on them, and from you imply even after being cleaned something like that isn't safe to have anywhere near food or dishes.", "> We have a designated squeegee to wipe off any excess liquids off the counter but I couldn\u2019t find it in its normal place so I just used this window wiping tool I found next to the sink that looked to be somewhat similar, and was honestly equally effective.\n\nHe didn't use *a* window squeegee, he used *the* window squeegee. So it's probably still got window cleaner on it. \n\nJust because I use the same *type* of sponge for my dishes and my countertops doesn't mean I use the same sponge - and I hope you don't either.", "> We have a designated squeegee\n\nFrom OP's post. If it's so irrelevant what tool is used, *why is there a designated tool?* Either there's a good reason, and OP is breaking hygeniene protocol; or there's a dumb reason, in which case OP is still breaking his workplace's rules. \n\nThis is really not a rocket science situation.", "Where did he say he used the window squeegee?? He literally only labeled it as a window cleaning tool for description purchases. He makes it clear it was already found in the dish pit, you are literally just making things up to fit your narrative that this must be the window squeegee. You even used italics on the to really make it seem like he's using THE window cleaner tool."]}
