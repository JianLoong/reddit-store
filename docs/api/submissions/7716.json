I\u2019m by no means argumentative or problematic, but I\u2019m not very talkative and I walk around with an expressionless look on my face, which I guess has rubbed people the wrong way.

I find her completely obnoxious. She\u2019s passive aggressive, gossips about other workers behind their backs, and just generally has this \u201cholier than thou\u201d vibe about her acting like she\u2019s the most mature and competent person in the workplace when really she\u2019s no different than anyone else.\n\nI don\u2019t argue or instigate any conflicts with her, but I make an active effort not to make eye contact and respond only with one worded answers or nods when she talks to me. I also reject all her attempts to make small talk with me. This has lead to a mutual dislike between us.\n\nThis morning I was on shift cleaning the dishes and dirty water was starting to pile up on the counter. We have a designated squeegee to wipe off any excess liquids off the counter but I couldn\u2019t find it in its normal place so I just used this window wiping tool I found next to the sink that looked to be somewhat similar, and was honestly equally effective.\n\nAs I start wiping, Mary walks in and causes the biggest scene, saying I have no common sense and makes fun of me for using the wrong tool to clean the sink counter.\n\nI told her that the original squeegee was missing and that since I found it lying next to the sink I just assumed that was what the store was using as a substitute in the meantime.\n\nShe then starts going around gossiping about me to the other workers and as I walked out to grab something from the counter I caught her talking about me, and for the first time ever I lost my temper and told her to shut the fuck up. \n\nMary: He\u2019s such an idiot, he  was using the window wiper to clean the sink, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with him I swear he has no common sense. \n\nMe(behind her): Oh my god get the fuck over it. I swear you never shut the fuck up, you\u2019re always bitching or moaning about the smallest things, it\u2019s really not that fucking deep. \n\nThis was the first time I\u2019ve ever gotten into any sort of verbal argument with anyone at work, everyone including Mary was shocked and she didn\u2019t speak to me for the rest of the shift.", "created_utc": 1674117796, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10fws50/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_to_shut_the_fuck_up/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is highly unprofessional and losing your head like that makes you look like a loose cannon, even if you felt justified. If there is someone in your workplace who is making it hard for you to focus on working or is creating a toxic environment (her gossiping) the proper thing to do is if you're comfortable with it politely speak to them and let them know what they are doing is making you upset and to please cease the behavior or report it to your manager and if they do nothing take it to HR.

Also by avoiding eye contact, making one word answers, and just nods you are displaying you dislike them which has nothing to do with what you feel is expressionless and it is these actions that will rub people up the wrong way.\n\nYou also did \u201cfuck up\u201d using the window cleaner to wipe away a surface you presumably use for clean products?  Yes Mary is hardly perfect but you appear to have no contrition over your mistake or an ability to laugh it off.  And given your treatment of Mary who has tried in the past to at least treat you with the bare basics of civility that you have clearly rejected you have set yourself up for her to take the piss out of you.\n\nI think you need to take a good long look at yourself and how you interact with others before you go casting judgment and being verbally abusive to your colleagues.

Flinging obscenities at your coworker is not the correct response.  \n\nMore importantly, being a good person means sometimes taking the high road.  You had other options.  You had better options.
