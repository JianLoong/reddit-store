My mum then started dating a new man (I'll call him Sam) when I was 8 and we moved in with him when I was 9. I used to do the vaccuming every morning and never once got a please or thank you when I did. I felt under appreciated and after a while they would stop asking and just expected me to do it. If I forgot to do it once in a while, I would get yelled at and lectured about how I was lazy and never did anything around the house by my mum. I found out at some point that Sam was the one complaining about it to my mum and yelling at her for my bad behaviour, making her lash out at me. Eventually I got fed up with never being appreciated and getting yelled at so I just stopped all together. I'm a busy highschool student and just didn't have the energy to put up with the yelling.\nRecently, Sam has been getting more and more angry at my mum for small insignificant things that can either be communicated about or fixed easily. They're never particularly affectionate but I never really thought much of it.\n\n\nThis morning my mum came into my room telling me to do a deep clean of my room because our house would probably go on the market soon. The last time my mum said something like this is when she divorced my dad, so I immediately connected the dots a d realised what was happening. I cried as I cleaned my room for a few hours then calmed down as best I could. Later, my sister texted me that she was out in the kitchen and my mum was complaining to her mum (our grandmother) that I was lazy and the whole reason why Sam was getting so angry all the time. Thay I was a burden and she couldn't deal with it anymore.\n\nI feel like my world is falling down around me and everything that is happening is my fault.

This is so sad OP. Mum is blaming you, but you are not the cause of the relationship failure. His anger at you is wrong. OK, to be honest doing some chores is to be expected, frankly you should be doing some helping around the house. However you shouldn't be shouted at about it. Your help should be appreciated, not dismissed, no yelling, no lectures. So Sam has anger issues, he probably doesn't want to be a stepfather, and his anger is getting worse. If he has a problem with you he should talk to your Mum, and she talk to you, no yelling either way. It's his turning to anger that is driving them apart, you are just the scapegoat. But, for your Mum, and because you are 14, do your chores!", "NTA. Tell your Grandmother what's happening, she deserve to know the truth.", "He\u2019s TAH. There are ways for people to have a conversation with others. For him to get angry about a child (I don\u2019t care if you 5 or 14, your mother is still your protector) is childish. Slightly narcissistic. If he had an issue, he could have asked for a family meeting to discuss the responsibilities within the household. For your mother to carry the burden of relaying his \u201cmessage\u201d should have also been handled differently. The relationship was broken between them. If you were to have stayed with your father, they would have found fault in their relationship elsewhere.", "N T A for situation with Sam but I have to ask, do you have any chores? You stopped vaccuming, ok, but do you help with cleaning, washing, anything? If you do nothing at all - E S H.", "NTA.  Oh my love, I'm so sorry you're beating yourself up like this.  It's NOT your fault.  Marriages don't break up because a teenager isn't doing household chores.  You're describing a pattern of behaviour between your mother and Sam that clearly shows a lot of tension.  \n\nI hope that, whatever happens, the tension in your house lessens.  It must be exhausting and upsetting for you.", "ESH\nyou didn't brake them up, but it's weird that you expected to be asked and thanked daily for doing your chores.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But tell your grandmother that you still did other chores, just not the vacuuming. Honestly, if that's the only thing causing a rift between the two, then they're very sad people.\n\nI'm sure your mom is throwing blame your way, because it's easier than admitting her faults in picking this angry dude to marry.  And there's probably other stuff going on to make Sam angry, he just can't adult up and deal.\n\nI wish you well.  You deserve better.  It's not your fault.  I hope you can see a therapist.  Even if the adults in your life can't manage their big feels and choose to use you as a cover for their personal issues, I'm sure you can learn to realize it's not you.  It's them.", "It is not your fault if your mom and Sam are having problems.  A 14 year old girl not doing household chores doesn't break up a marriage.  I promise.  Your mom might say it's all your fault, but she's wrong, refusing to look at the problems between her and Sam.  (And no, that problem isn't you.)\n\nSometimes people going through a hard time look for other people to blame because it's too painful to look at the reality.  I think that's what's happening here.\n\nPlease see if your school guidance counselor can get you a referral to a therapist.  You shouldn't have to deal with all the self-blame and recrimination from your mom or with Sam's unreasonable anger alone. \n\nAgain, if they are, in fact, getting divorced, it is not your fault. Whether or not you mop adequately is completely irrelevant to what's happening between them.  Please talk this through with a therapist.\n\nNTA", "Can you go stay with your father? Your mother is awful.", "I help out around the house in some areas. I cook dinner, I alternate dishes with my sister, I dust and clean the upstairs bathroom. Because my school schedule is hectic, it gets pretty difficult, but I still do what I can it was just that vaccuming was my main chore. Thank you for the advice \ud83e\ude77"]}
