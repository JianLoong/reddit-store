{"id": 18721, "submission_id": "13xmzbq", "title": "AITA for refusing a position my boss thought I would accept?", "selftext": "Sorry, it's a long story. TLDR at the bottom.\n\nI started at this new company about a year ago, and I've been doing very well. There have been hints dropped that once my current supervisor leaves, I would take her position (she's been talking about moving out of state for a while).\n\nI was excited about that idea because her position is \"regional\" and I would love to have that title on my resume.\n\nWell, she gave notice and is leaving on June 6th. I was asked if I wanted to take on some of her responsibilities. When I asked about the title and pay, I did not receive a response.\n\nTwo days passed, and the main boss man calls me, essentially saying that I didn't show proper appreciation for the offer and that my response was tactless. He then tells me a story about how he once took a pay decrease in order to get more experience. My response was that I already knew about the responsibilities he expected me to take on, I knew the location, I knew the coworkers. The only questions I had were the ones I asked, and I was direct in order to save time, because I know they need to fill that role quickly.\n\nHe then said that he's not going to just give me the regional role, that I need to pay my dues. The position they would move me to now would pay another $2-$3/hour. He and I both know that the workload increase is worth a minimum of $5-$7/hour.\n\nI reminded him that I am essentially already filling the role as regional, and that just because I've only been with this company for a year, does not discredit the prior experience I have. He asked if I wanted the position, and I said that my current job is perfect for me, and he would have to bribe me out of it.\n\nHe's upset with me because he assumed I wanted the role, since hints had been dropped for a while now and I seemed eager to take it. But, he never directly asked me about it, so... isn't that kind of on him?\n\nI feel justified and proud of myself for not allowing myself to be taken advantage of, but I do feel bad that I am not doing what was expected of me.\n\n**TLDR: Boss tried to give me more responsibilities with no title change and a tiny raise to absorb a position that is worth a much bigger raise and title boost. I am not going along with it as he expected, and now he's upset with me.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the validation. This was a new experience for me, as I am usually eager for new opportunities. I just felt shaken up after the conversation went down, but posting here has made me feel more confident. My resume is already polished up and ready for circulation. I'd hate to leave this company because other than this one issue, it has been great. If things get uncomfortable though, I will take the advise many have suggested and find a new job. \n\nBoss man is coming to my city on Monday for an exit interview with the supervisor who is leaving, and I have no doubt he will swing by for a conversation with me as well. I will stick to my guns.
