TLDR at the bottom.\n\nI started at this new company about a year ago, and I've been doing very well. There have been hints dropped that once my current supervisor leaves, I would take her position (she's been talking about moving out of state for a while).\n\nI was excited about that idea because her position is \"regional\" and I would love to have that title on my resume.\n\nWell, she gave notice and is leaving on June 6th. I was asked if I wanted to take on some of her responsibilities. When I asked about the title and pay, I did not receive a response.\n\nTwo days passed, and the main boss man calls me, essentially saying that I didn't show proper appreciation for the offer and that my response was tactless. He then tells me a story about how he once took a pay decrease in order to get more experience. My response was that I already knew about the responsibilities he expected me to take on, I knew the location, I knew the coworkers. The only questions I had were the ones I asked, and I was direct in order to save time, because I know they need to fill that role quickly.\n\nHe then said that he's not going to just give me the regional role, that I need to pay my dues. The position they would move me to now would pay another $2-$3/hour. He and I both know that the workload increase is worth a minimum of $5-$7/hour.\n\nI reminded him that I am essentially already filling the role as regional, and that just because I've only been with this company for a year, does not discredit the prior experience I have. He asked if I wanted the position, and I said that my current job is perfect for me, and he would have to bribe me out of it.\n\nHe's upset with me because he assumed I wanted the role, since hints had been dropped for a while now and I seemed eager to take it. But, he never directly asked me about it, so... isn't that kind of on him?\n\nI feel justified and proud of myself for not allowing myself to be taken advantage of, but I do feel bad that I am not doing what was expected of me.\n\n**TLDR: Boss tried to give me more responsibilities with no title change and a tiny raise to absorb a position that is worth a much bigger raise and title boost. I am not going along with it as he expected, and now he's upset with me.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the validation. This was a new experience for me, as I am usually eager for new opportunities. I just felt shaken up after the conversation went down, but posting here has made me feel more confident. My resume is already polished up and ready for circulation. I'd hate to leave this company because other than this one issue, it has been great. If things get uncomfortable though, I will take the advise many have suggested and find a new job. \n\nBoss man is coming to my city on Monday for an exit interview with the supervisor who is leaving, and I have no doubt he will swing by for a conversation with me as well.

The pleasantry is important to successful negotiation. Asking about the financial implications is important, treating the financial implications like they are the only important factor is not a good look. \n\nTraining a person for a new role (and everyone needs some training or support) is a company investment. No one wants to invest in someone they think is just out for themselves. \n\nI don't think your manager handled it well either. I'd have handled it by just sending you an email outlining our offer, while also investigating our other options so if you didn't except I'd have back ups. I'd also assume at that point that I was going to lose you and start investing in options for your role so regardless of the outcome my business would come out well.", "NTA  Boss is annoyed because you wouldn't take more responsibility for inadequate pay and no title, not because you indicated you were interested in the job.  Boss thought you'd take flattery at being offered the position over actual compensation.  \n\nAnyway, if the Boss talks to you when he comes to town and you want to give him room to \"win\" you could say that you would take on the responsibility for an additional $5 and no title change right now but a review with the expectation of being giving the regional title in six months and an increase of an additional $3 at that time.  Get it in writing that you'll get the title and increase if the review is satisfactory (spell out what that means if you can).  That does let him go back and say you'll take the job and then he can play it like the title and small increase came after sufficient experience and review.", "Boss already saw OP as a cheap replacement and so obviously is someone who wants to exploit existing workers for savings rather than promoting quality workers.

That decision was based on an interpretation of whether being fired for those things constituted being fired because of gender identity, since that was a protected category.\n\nIn many places you can still be fired for voting for a politician your boss doesn\u2019t like or leaving work at your scheduled end of work time if your boss tells you to stay late.\n\nAdditionally, a lot of laws that give the rights we do have don\u2019t apply to companies with only a few employees.", "He didnt offer you the position, just the responsability.

See my edit up top", "I\u2019m referring to the last part of your comment.", "Well, if they're trying to climb the corporate ladder then my comment stands. Life isn't fair. You can and should know what you're worth. And let's assume that you want to get to what you know you're worth as quickly as possible.\n\nFor example let's say you're at $50k, you know you're worth $65k for 1 level above you. But you were only offered $55k. In this scenario you're sticking it to the man and staying at $50k, giving up $5k + a title increase because that workload isn't worth it. \n\nFair right?  I say no, you played yourself. Let's say you finally get that $65k after another 2 years. If you had swallowed your pride and taken the low-ball offer and gotten to your next level and $65k in a year you now have cost yourself $5k immediately + $15k for the extra year spent at the same level.\n\nTake it a step further. You're trying to not only get 1 level higher but even more. You can't get to the 2nd level until you hit the first level. And maybe that pays $100k. But you can't even sniff that until you take a $65k job and title.  How much longer have you delayed yourself from that level? \n\nThat's why I say people in the comments don't understand business. If you're looking out for you and trying to advance you say yes. If you say no you don't get the raise, you don't get the title, you kill any future opportunities at your current company, and you're still limiting the number of outside possibilities based on your title.  If you say yes you can and should be pissed off you aren't being treated right. And you use that to fuel you to move on to the next thing to get what you know you deserve and with the new title you have more opportunities, plus a larger higher level network, plus you may gain some great experience.\n\nEither way you're done with your current company who doesn't appreciate you. Why not take a shitty compensation offer and turn it into an opportunity to get you ahead quicker? And eventually somewhere you want to be.\n\nLook, I used to think like others have responded. I am fortunate to have people who have taught me different and it's allowed me to climb quickly recently. So my answer comes from real world experience. I leveraged a shit offer I wanted to walk away from but listened to mentors and took it. Lasted a year, and now I should make 50%+ more than I used to. I never would have had this opportunity if I took the poor advice of everyone here.", "I see what you\u2019re saying, and I don\u2019t think is a black and white situation. Some bosses could appreciate the fact the OP stood up for themselves.

I've left a job over this myself as I was doing supervisor work and HR balked at giving any form of it. \n\nEnjoy your new workplace when you find one, as people will hire you for your base title, then you become the magical godsend employee as somehow you know so much and need little training.
