You offered her a safe haven, and she broke all the boundaries. But, you might want to revisit your \"her drug dealer abusive ex boyfriend got her pregnant,\"  thought...that's not quite how that works.", "NTA.  She is an addict and going to give birth to an addicted baby.  It is so sad for the child she is damaging.  I doubt CPS or that dirt if agency can do anything until the baby is born, but I would report her anyways.  I believe they drug test babies if they have an inkling that the mother used, but better to be sure so that baby can get the best care they deserve.  Also, she shouldn\u2019t have custody if she has drugs around.  The baby could OD.", "NTA \n\nYou were right to kick her out. Look setting boundaries is hard, but you needed to do it. I get you want to help her, but she doesn\u2019t want help OP. She wants to be cared for. She was never going to be fine with living a straight life, getting a job, paying her share, and putting her child first, and sacrificing her youth in the process. It doesn\u2019t matter what you did for her. She wanted to live rent free, do what she wanted, go where she wanted, not be responsible for anything, and have you and/or your gf to pawn the baby off at a whim (when motherhood grew boring or hard on her. It\u2019s extremely unreasonable, not to mention unfair to expect (of anyone). Family helps family, yes; (if you have a good family) but that doesnt include indefinitely taking on responsibility for them. I could understand asking you to take her to doctors appointments, giving her rides to work, helping her (on occasion) with paying for things the baby needed, or helping her watch the baby when she had to go to work last minute and there wasn\u2019t a babysitter available. \n\nThose are all reasonable requests, whatever the hell she wanted doesn\u2019t fall into that category. Just so you know the term \u201cfamily helps family\u201d, is meant to go both ways. Helping your family doesn\u2019t mean you give, give, give, sacrifice, give, sacrifice, over and over without anything or minimal in return. (& No, cleaning the house as a form of rent doesn\u2019t count and helping you in return). Even outside of this particular situation, you shouldn\u2019t be doing something for anyone you don\u2019t know beyond the shadow of a doubt would do the same for you and without complaint. I\u2019d give my family the world, sacrifice anything for them; but they\u2019ve done and do everything for me . They\u2019ve took me everywhere when I didn\u2019t have a car, helped me with money when I was short, took me to the doctors, nursed me to health and stayed by my life after a life threatening accident, helped me get multiple jobs, they co signed my car for me, the list goes on and on and on. I\u2019d do the same, and I have; but even with my family dynamic there\u2019s limits. \n\nThere\u2019s a point where they\u2019re not asking for help anymore, they\u2019re taking advantage. She tried to use her predicament and pregnancy as a means to get you to help her; hell she actually used your parents wanting her to get an abortion as means to make you feel like you were the only one helping to protect her baby. All the while she\u2019s actively doing drugs and harming her child, while putting you in danger by having it in your house. By that I mean legally, or if she\u2019s really an addict if she borrows some she can\u2019t pay back and they know she lives with you. It\u2019s asking for issues all around even without the child involved. She needed the wake up call, and I hope you don\u2019t take anything she did to heart. Her promises and cries are empty. My dad used to tell me that there\u2019s no one more convincing, or someone more convinced of your cruelty; than someone who wants something from you but can\u2019t get it. She would\u2019ve promised anything, and when that failed; she would\u2019ve called you anything, said anything to make you feel like the devil incarnate; and gave her anything she wanted (to prove yourself otherwise). \n\nShe clearly did a good job since you even had to ask which is sad. She\u2019ll be fine OP, she either gets clean, gets a job, and become responsible enough to support herself; or she needs to give that baby up for adoption or abort it, atleast in the last scenario she\u2019ll have a place to stay without having to grow up which is obviously what she wants. Your parents won\u2019t let her be homeless; she just needs to show some responsibility, or make a hard decision. If she can\u2019t or refuses and ends up homeless, know it\u2019s not because you kicked her out, or because she didn\u2019t have the help; it\u2019s because she refused to take responsibility and grow up. Sometimes as much as it hurts, you have to let people learn on their own. It\u2019s not on you to protect her from the lessons she\u2019s meant to learn in life. Just try to move forward, don\u2019t let the guilt of her words other you, remind yourself that she would\u2019ve said anything to convince you to stay. Good or bad. Lean on your partner and just try to remember that it\u2019s not your responsibility to fix her, I\u2019m so sorry OP.", "NTA OP.  Despite the issues between the two of you, you still let your sister live there until you found out about the drugs.", "NTA I hope she gets professional help. \n\nYou don't want that in your home. And make sure she hasn't taken a key because you'll come back to an empty house when she runs out of money.", "NTA\n\nIt's an unfortunate situation but she's putting you and your GF in a difficult situation legally as well. You did the right thing. She's burning her bridges right now.", "Just let things calm down, she probably found some couch to surf on.  Or is back with her ex drug dealer boyfriend.
