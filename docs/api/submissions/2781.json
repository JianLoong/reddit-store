In late September, my husband was out of town for work and emailed me announcing that he wants a divorce. I was completely blindsided and had to call him multiple times before he confirmed that he did want a divorce. He claimed he\u2019d been unhappy for a long time and chose to email me while he was away from me so he wouldn\u2019t have to deal with me being hysterical and unreasonable. \n\nAfter a lot of begging for clarification, he said the major reason for divorce is that he can\u2019t handle my illness. I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder a couple years ago that causes some painful physical symptoms. I have learned to manage it with a lot of diet control and exercises, but I have occasional flareups of pain. More importantly, it hasn\u2019t affected his lifestyle at all because he has done nothing to take care of me and I still manage almost all of the household while working full time. \n\nHe stayed away from home for a month saying that he was staying with a friend, but wouldn\u2019t tell me what friend. I searched through online credit card charges and cell phone records and I suspected an affair. I pretended I had figured it out and he admitted that he was seeing another woman. I searched through years of card charges and found that he had been visiting this location for over a year. I remembered one particular week where I begged him to not travel and take time off to help me because I was in a lot of pain and we were dealing with a lot of issues (home heating broke down, son had problems at school, dog needed lot of vet visits) and he was adamant that he couldn\u2019t risk his job and had to go. But it turns out he was visiting this woman. That realization turned my heartbreak into anger and I was done. I stopped calling him and instead started talking to lawyers. \n\nBy the time he came home I had moved all his stuff into a guest room and had a possible plan of action for divorce and division of assets. I didn\u2019t argue with him at all, just gave him the paperwork. We have been silent roommates since then and today he asks me what the menu is for thanksgiving. I told him there\u2019s no way I am hosting a thanksgiving dinner for his family at this point. He said that since I\u2019ve done that every year since we were married, my inlaws expect us to host and I can\u2019t cancel at the last minute. \n\nAll this stress has already exacerbated my pain, I really can\u2019t manage a party at my house. I know it is unfair to my in-laws to cancel dinner a few days before the event, but I argued he should be responsible for his family and not expect me to manage them after he tells me he\u2019s leaving me. He claims he hasn\u2019t told his family anything and doesn\u2019t want to ruin thanksgiving and christmas for them by making an announcement now.

However, I can\u2019t believe how much of an AH your husband is. His behavior is a next level kind of selfishness that gives him a ticket on the hell express where you skip the line and just go straight on through. Then, the fact that he wants you to still make dinner for his family is extremely repulsive. Since he enjoys spending so much time with his girlfriend instead of taking care of his wife, who is in pain and needs someone to help carry the load, I would tell him that the girlfriend should be the one cooking, hosting, and taking care of his family. You should be relaxing and taking care of yourself. I truly hope you have a family member or friend that you can spend Thanksgiving with and take a load off. Peace.", "NTA- so much nta. He is the asshole and he can feed and host his family if he wants with his new girlfriend. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve figured it out and will be so much better without him", "NTA. You should give him a choice. Either he can cook for his family or he can tell them.  But you're out regardless. He can't seriously cheat for a year, ask for divorce and then expect you to make Thanksgiving dinner. Not only that but he's going to expect you to play the happily married part until after the holidays before he tells them? Don't put yourself through that. Please.", "NTA call your in laws and tell them yourself", "They stopped being in-laws when he said he wanted a divorce, he shouldn\u2019t be mad/petty about this. I\u2019d tell his family why you\u2019re canceling and what you\u2019ve discovered about his affair, and him wanting a divorce.\n\nNTA. He can host if he wants to, you have no obligation to do so even if you two were still together.", "Nta. You might not be legally divorced yet, but when he started the affair, he lost you. That also means his family lost you. A quite clear case is FAFO. This is not your problem to host his family.", "The NERVE omg, NTA whatsoever. Man deserves to be thrown to the streets. I\u2019m so sorry, I wish you all the best and happiness in your next chapter without him \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA for not wanting to host thanksgiving for his family, but I do have a suggestion since he is such a coward host it and when you are serving dinner pass out copies of the divorce papers, and also let them know why he wants a divorce because he is a degenerate cheater and a bum for walking out on a good woman because you are sick.", "NTA. Honestly , what gall to tell you, you still have to do that for his family. You don't owe him anything! If it were me, I'd be nice enough to buy the ingredients and then leave it to him to cook. Better yet, I'd tell him to get his gf over to do it.\n\nI understand it is a bit last minute and the want to not put your in laws out on such a big holiday, but if you don't want to do it, there's no shame in that. If you do end up cooking, just make sure he doesn't get any of it. You're cooking for his family, not him.", "NTA.  You two made a joint decision to get divorced, and divorce is in the works.  If he doesn't want to be honest with his family, that is soooooooooo not your problem.", "Lololol. Your stbx really takes the cake...or at least the pumpkin pie. What an absolute a$$. \n\nNTA. \n\nI do rather like the above posters' thoughts on still hosting, just so that you can spill the beans. His parents should know who he is.", "NTA - They aren't your in-laws anymore. Any bonds or kinship was shattered when he threw you under the bus for your illness as the reason for his affair. Good of you to lawyer up, and if I may suggest, take this asshole for all he is worth. Get as much information as you can about his affair so your lawyers can weaponize it for alimony and custody. None of this is your fault, but you need to prepare yourself and child for the rough road ahead.", "NTA\n\nHis family, he can deal with them. If they ask, lay it out straight. He\u2019s been cheating for a year and you are divorcing,", "Tell his family to go to his new girlfriend's house. \n\nNTA. Screw him and his family.", "Good lord! NTA  I have so many things to say here. He can feel free to host his family and you can feel free to go rent a room at the best hotel in town and order room service. Or maybe you have some other people that you want to spend Thanksgiving with? The audacity to think that he is going to not take care of you, cheat on you with someone else, leave you to deal with everything and then expect you to host his family and take care of them? Wow just wow. You're getting divorced. You don't owe any of them anything. You do owe yourself something though.", "So obviously NTA that I don\u2019t even get why you\u2019re asking. \n\nTell him to GTFO and host his own family at an AirBnB or restaurant. Announce the divorce yourself, tell them why and what happened. \n\nSorry that your husband is such a horrible, lying, cheating coward who attempted to blame you by making it about your Illness. You deserve better.", "NTA at all. This guy has some nerves.", "NTA at all.\n\nHe wants a divorce.  He's getting it.  Perhaps the new girlfriend would like to host Thanksgiving for his family?\n\nI would ring your soon to be ex inlaws.  Apologise for not holding thanksgiving but you feel that in light of the upcoming divorce and his cheating that you don't feel it's appropriate for you to host anything this year.\n\nYou are under no obligation at all to him.\n\nHe's shown you what he is.  Your best revenge is to live your best life and find someone who really is your soulmate while his life turns to crap.", "Not really adding much to what others said but hoping that seeing larger numbers of NTA comments will help you get rid of uncertainty. The absolute nerve of this guy\u2026 why doesn\u2019t his mistress host it?? I don\u2019t even get why he would want you to, because obviously you\u2019re not going to pretend everything is ok and you\u2019re going to spill the beans. He is really not very bright, and definitely a massive AH", "Tell him his AP can host thanksgiving, not your problem anymore", "NTA. Don't you dare give this garbage person another second of your time.", "NTA\n\nWhy would you be willing to cook and host a family event where you will be stuck spending the day with the spouse you are divorcing and their family, and your child being the only blood relative?\n\nWhile not all families will go completely non-contact with their former in laws (generally for the sake of any children), it seems pretty reasonable that the burden of dealing with them falls to their child/your ex, and not you.\n\nI would see it as completely reasonable to send them a message and be blunt about the situation - he is divorcing you, you have no desire to spend thanksgiving with him, and you had assumed he had organised alternative plans - as it turns out he has not, you are sorry for the late notice but he failed to discuss this with you too. \nHopefully a reasonable way to drop him in it, while still preserving some relationship to your former in laws for the sake of any children involved.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They have 3 kids, he's a successful contractor.  She's a school administrator. My wife put her in touch with one of her lawyer buddies who we were foster parents with.

She got the house, full child support,  half his retirement fund and a very nice chunk of everything else. Last I heard, his side piece broke things off because he's not going to be as wealthy as she thought he would be.\nHon, chronic illness is extremely expensive. Don't feel one ounce of guilt doing this. You're going to need everything extra you can manage to be able to take care of yourself. Hell, one hospital stay for my wife was almost $2 million! I damn near had heart failure! And the co-pays for her dialysis treatments are roughly $400 each! That's $4800 a month! We're lucky we qualify for financial assistance through the clinic and the state!\nSo, yeah, get a good lawyer and go to town. Unhappy or not, your husband had marital responsibility to use his words and communicate to you! He broke the contract,  so to speak,  now go after the penalties you are definitely owed.
