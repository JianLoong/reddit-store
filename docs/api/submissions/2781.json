In late September, my husband was out of town for work and emailed me announcing that he wants a divorce. I was completely blindsided and had to call him multiple times before he confirmed that he did want a divorce. He claimed he\u2019d been unhappy for a long time and chose to email me while he was away from me so he wouldn\u2019t have to deal with me being hysterical and unreasonable. \n\nAfter a lot of begging for clarification, he said the major reason for divorce is that he can\u2019t handle my illness. I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder a couple years ago that causes some painful physical symptoms. I have learned to manage it with a lot of diet control and exercises, but I have occasional flareups of pain. More importantly, it hasn\u2019t affected his lifestyle at all because he has done nothing to take care of me and I still manage almost all of the household while working full time. \n\nHe stayed away from home for a month saying that he was staying with a friend, but wouldn\u2019t tell me what friend. I searched through online credit card charges and cell phone records and I suspected an affair. I pretended I had figured it out and he admitted that he was seeing another woman. I searched through years of card charges and found that he had been visiting this location for over a year. I remembered one particular week where I begged him to not travel and take time off to help me because I was in a lot of pain and we were dealing with a lot of issues (home heating broke down, son had problems at school, dog needed lot of vet visits) and he was adamant that he couldn\u2019t risk his job and had to go. But it turns out he was visiting this woman. That realization turned my heartbreak into anger and I was done. I stopped calling him and instead started talking to lawyers. \n\nBy the time he came home I had moved all his stuff into a guest room and had a possible plan of action for divorce and division of assets. I didn\u2019t argue with him at all, just gave him the paperwork. We have been silent roommates since then and today he asks me what the menu is for thanksgiving. I told him there\u2019s no way I am hosting a thanksgiving dinner for his family at this point. He said that since I\u2019ve done that every year since we were married, my inlaws expect us to host and I can\u2019t cancel at the last minute. \n\nAll this stress has already exacerbated my pain, I really can\u2019t manage a party at my house. I know it is unfair to my in-laws to cancel dinner a few days before the event, but I argued he should be responsible for his family and not expect me to manage them after he tells me he\u2019s leaving me. He claims he hasn\u2019t told his family anything and doesn\u2019t want to ruin thanksgiving and christmas for them by making an announcement now.

However, I can\u2019t believe how much of an AH your husband is. His behavior is a next level kind of selfishness that gives him a ticket on the hell express where you skip the line and just go straight on through. Then, the fact that he wants you to still make dinner for his family is extremely repulsive. Since he enjoys spending so much time with his girlfriend instead of taking care of his wife, who is in pain and needs someone to help carry the load, I would tell him that the girlfriend should be the one cooking, hosting, and taking care of his family. You should be relaxing and taking care of yourself. I truly hope you have a family member or friend that you can spend Thanksgiving with and take a load off. Peace.", "NTA- so much nta. He is the asshole and he can feed and host his family if he wants with his new girlfriend. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve figured it out and will be so much better without him", "NTA. You should give him a choice. Either he can cook for his family or he can tell them.  But you're out regardless. He can't seriously cheat for a year, ask for divorce and then expect you to make Thanksgiving dinner. Not only that but he's going to expect you to play the happily married part until after the holidays before he tells them? Don't put yourself through that. Please.", "NTA call your in laws and tell them yourself", "They stopped being in-laws when he said he wanted a divorce, he shouldn\u2019t be mad/petty about this. I\u2019d tell his family why you\u2019re canceling and what you\u2019ve discovered about his affair, and him wanting a divorce.\n\nNTA. He can host if he wants to, you have no obligation to do so even if you two were still together.", "Nta. You might not be legally divorced yet, but when he started the affair, he lost you. That also means his family lost you. A quite clear case is FAFO. This is not your problem to host his family.", "The NERVE omg, NTA whatsoever. Man deserves to be thrown to the streets. I\u2019m so sorry, I wish you all the best and happiness in your next chapter without him \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA for not wanting to host thanksgiving for his family, but I do have a suggestion since he is such a coward host it and when you are serving dinner pass out copies of the divorce papers, and also let them know why he wants a divorce because he is a degenerate cheater and a bum for walking out on a good woman because you are sick.", "NTA. Honestly , what gall to tell you, you still have to do that for his family. You don't owe him anything! If it were me, I'd be nice enough to buy the ingredients and then leave it to him to cook. Better yet, I'd tell him to get his gf over to do it.\n\nI understand it is a bit last minute and the want to not put your in laws out on such a big holiday, but if you don't want to do it, there's no shame in that. If you do end up cooking, just make sure he doesn't get any of it. You're cooking for his family, not him.", "NTA.  You two made a joint decision to get divorced, and divorce is in the works.  If he doesn't want to be honest with his family, that is soooooooooo not your problem.", "Lololol. Your stbx really takes the cake...or at least the pumpkin pie. What an absolute a$$. \n\nNTA. \n\nI do rather like the above posters' thoughts on still hosting, just so that you can spill the beans. His parents should know who he is.", "NTA - They aren't your in-laws anymore. Any bonds or kinship was shattered when he threw you under the bus for your illness as the reason for his affair. Good of you to lawyer up, and if I may suggest, take this asshole for all he is worth. Get as much information as you can about his affair so your lawyers can weaponize it for alimony and custody. None of this is your fault, but you need to prepare yourself and child for the rough road ahead.", "NTA\n\nHis family, he can deal with them. If they ask, lay it out straight. He\u2019s been cheating for a year and you are divorcing,", "Tell his family to go to his new girlfriend's house. \n\nNTA. Screw him and his family.", "Good lord! NTA  I have so many things to say here. He can feel free to host his family and you can feel free to go rent a room at the best hotel in town and order room service. Or maybe you have some other people that you want to spend Thanksgiving with? The audacity to think that he is going to not take care of you, cheat on you with someone else, leave you to deal with everything and then expect you to host his family and take care of them? Wow just wow. You're getting divorced. You don't owe any of them anything. You do owe yourself something though.", "So obviously NTA that I don\u2019t even get why you\u2019re asking. \n\nTell him to GTFO and host his own family at an AirBnB or restaurant. Announce the divorce yourself, tell them why and what happened. \n\nSorry that your husband is such a horrible, lying, cheating coward who attempted to blame you by making it about your Illness. You deserve better.", "NTA at all. This guy has some nerves.", "NTA at all.\n\nHe wants a divorce.  He's getting it.  Perhaps the new girlfriend would like to host Thanksgiving for his family?\n\nI would ring your soon to be ex inlaws.  Apologise for not holding thanksgiving but you feel that in light of the upcoming divorce and his cheating that you don't feel it's appropriate for you to host anything this year.\n\nYou are under no obligation at all to him.\n\nHe's shown you what he is.  Your best revenge is to live your best life and find someone who really is your soulmate while his life turns to crap.", "Not really adding much to what others said but hoping that seeing larger numbers of NTA comments will help you get rid of uncertainty. The absolute nerve of this guy\u2026 why doesn\u2019t his mistress host it?? I don\u2019t even get why he would want you to, because obviously you\u2019re not going to pretend everything is ok and you\u2019re going to spill the beans. He is really not very bright, and definitely a massive AH", "Tell him his AP can host thanksgiving, not your problem anymore", "NTA. Don't you dare give this garbage person another second of your time.", "NTA\n\nWhy would you be willing to cook and host a family event where you will be stuck spending the day with the spouse you are divorcing and their family, and your child being the only blood relative?\n\nWhile not all families will go completely non-contact with their former in laws (generally for the sake of any children), it seems pretty reasonable that the burden of dealing with them falls to their child/your ex, and not you.\n\nI would see it as completely reasonable to send them a message and be blunt about the situation - he is divorcing you, you have no desire to spend thanksgiving with him, and you had assumed he had organised alternative plans - as it turns out he has not, you are sorry for the late notice but he failed to discuss this with you too. \nHopefully a reasonable way to drop him in it, while still preserving some relationship to your former in laws for the sake of any children involved.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I wish you all well and hope you have a great holiday.\u201d", "[removed]", "I think he didn\u2019t actually want the divorce. Something seemingly magical happened while we was with his AP that inspired him to initiate it. It was easy to bat OP away when she called, and to finally admit to the affair, because he had the other woman\u2019s support during that time. Now he\u2019s home and the other woman isn\u2019t there and he\u2019s realizing how empty it all is. He\u2019s about to go months at a time without a partner there to hold him. He has to disrupt the relationship his family has with OP too and he knows that\u2019s not going to feel good, especially with AP nowhere near to comfort him. \n\nAnd he wants to wait until after Christmas?? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about the family dinners at all. He doesn\u2019t actually want OP to go. But if he didn\u2019t want to tell people before the holidays he should\u2019ve waited until after Christmas to break up with her. What about her holiday?", "While I agree with the thought behind the scissor idea, I found that with a cheater you are forced to live with for a bit, who also expects laundry services, that a seam ripper is more effective.  Just a few threads though, so the clothing falls apart slowly while the other person is wearing them.", "And he blamed his approach on her as well, since he was sure she\u2019d be \u201chysterical and unreasonable.\u201d He sounds like someone who is trying to return his wife-object because it\u2019s broken, not someone who sees OP as a person at all.", "You should consider that you have been given an exemption from hosting his family\u2019s events.  \n\nMy husband left me at this time of year and one of my first rational thoughts after the storm I was blindsided by was: \u201cThank God I no longer have to host Thanksgiving for all of his work buddies!\u201d   (We lived overseas and were the go-to house for Americans and non-Americans who wanted to celebrate Thanksgiving.  Ugh!).", "Since he initiated the divorce can OP make him move out?", "Yes, OP, for the love of God tell them EXACTLY why Thanksgiving is canceled.", "My petty ass wouldn't cancel, but I would have a \"Flare Up\" day of, not cook, wait for him to fly off the handle, and then expose his ass. Receipts/invoices and all.", "That\u2019s way too much work! It sounds good in theory but it\u2019s a shit solution in practice. \n\nAlso, her child would be at dinner so it\u2019s extra cringe.", "If the credit card charges are at restaurants, please include those as \u201coptions\u201d they can eat at since he seems to enjoy their menu.", "Please do this and send us an update. Virtual hugs to you!", "That is fantastic! I am going to keep this in mind. Hopefully my spouse will never cheat because he will end up naked at work ;-p or one of my friends spouses\u2026", "I am so sorry that so many...  assholes... leave their significant others around this time of year, and that we are part of that club together. \n\nI hope you are in a better place now.", "Forensic Files comes to mind.", "Honey, you're just lighting the torch from the bridge your STBX lit on fire.  You are more than entitled to go scorched earth.", "I guess you could cook a simple dinner of turkey, boxed sides and then over dinner announce your husband has asked for divorce and have proof ready of his infidelity and his email.\n\nThat might be fun", "Yep. My friends husband did this. Had a whole ass second family, but when his parents asked why my friend was divorcing him, he heavily implied SHE was cheating. She got an irate call from her MIL, who was like a mom to her, and cleared up the \u201cconfusion\u201d in about 30 seconds, which made him lying about it make even less sense. \n\nThere was no point in lying. SHE was more involved with his family than he was (still is). He was moving in with the woman and her kids. It was all going to come out via one phone call. But he\u2019d been lying for so long, it was basically second nature. And he wanted those 5 brief minutes of being the injured party and getting sympathy before it all came tumbling down.", "How about \"ask the rational, reasonable, non-sick-with-something-she-can't-help new love-of-his-life-until-she-isn't\" for details?!  \nHe is a monster.", "Maybe they can serve ham instead of turkey to celebrate how piggish his behavior has been. \ud83d\ude0f", "Thanksgiving in the US is in four days, running out of time for sooner", "I was thinking on all the napkins. \ud83d\ude02", "I guess it is a club!  We all paid our dues in advance.  \n\nI am in a great place now (this was 14 years ago), thanks.  I sincerely hope that you are, too, as well as the rest of our fellow club members.", "Yeah, the mistress needs to step up \"Hi everybody! I'm the lovely lady that (husband's name) has been screwing behind his wife's back for over a year! Welcome to my home!\"", "Yes! Op should send the letter informing husband's family of what is going on and include an invitation to Other Woman's house for Thanksgiving dinner.", "That could work lol. Could be real petty & put a screenshot of it on the front of the family Christmas card\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02", "\"And since I, his mistress, have been happily having an affair with a married man who's unwilling to step up and help his sick wife, I  understand that, if **I** ever get sick, I can expect him to drop me like a hot potato. And of course, I also know that if he cheated **with** me before, he'll cheat **on** me in the future! Aren't I the clever one to have landed such a splendid catch of a man?\"", "Do we know that this woman even knows that she *is* the other woman though? For all we know,  he could have spun a wild story about being a divorced man that works out of town a lot and whose kid lives with the mom....", "Photoshop the mistress into last years card saying \u201cwe had a plus one and I didn\u2019t know.\u201d Then print the email inside the card. You know everyone is going to be interested when this mystery person is on the card. \ud83d\ude02", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nThis wins!"]}
