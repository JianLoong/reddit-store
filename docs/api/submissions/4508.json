The child is ONE.\n\nOf course she is going to be needy towards her own parents.", "NTA\n\nThe parents (or any other loved one) of the 4-year-old should have distracted her (Who wants a cookie? Who wants to see the pretty Christmas lights across the street? Who wants to help gramma put the candles in the birthday cake?) so that baby could wake up and become sociable with dad. \n\nThese are very age-appropriate behaviors for the wee ones. The adults, not so much.", "Nta. Im not sure why they think you were supposed to step in but clearly your husband was handling it his way. Your daughter wanted her father and had just woken up. Sometimes 1.5 year olds arent interested in a life lesson they just want their parent. Kudos to you both for not losing your cool with the situation.", "NTA. Your husband is an actual grown up. Your MIL and SIL should work on their clear internalized misogyny. Your daughter was feeling possessive over your husband as one year olds do. Your husband is capable of sorting the situation. It's not life threatening. The in laws need to take a breath.", "NTA you husband is capable of handling the situation. If not time he learns.", "NAH. You\u2019re talking about a baby and a pre-schooler who are learning about interpersonal relationships and boundaries. Things like this are going to happen. The only possible asshole here is your SIL because she was annoyed when her daughter got upset but none of this should surprise people with small children. Kids are the epitome of irrational more often than not. That\u2019s just how they are and sometimes it\u2019s annoying.", "NTA \n\nYou're right. Your husband can handle it. \nWas there a way that the kids could have sat on either side of him?", "NTA so there was 3 other adults in the room...but they wanted you to deal with it! \n\nThey are 1 and 4 years old...it is hard for that age group to deal with emotions...but 3 adults sitting there and not trying any distraction techniques and just demanding you remove the 1 year old is a bit pathetic!! Did no one think of playing peek a boo...or sitting next to the husband and putting the 4 year old on there knee and seeing...look!! We both sitting on knees yay!!!", "NTA, it definitely seems like there is a complex or 2 going on here with your in laws.", "NTA this feels not only like it was disrespecting your husband as a parent, but also like your child needed to be punished. Your child is a baby, it doesn't make sense to attempt to punish her", "ESH Nobody needs to leave the room.  Your husband has 2 sides.  The 2 children can learn to share.  Or, if your husband has some anatomical condition causing him to have only one side, the girls can learn to take turns.  If they need to cry some while learning, so be it.  Learning can be hard. There is no reason for parents to always prioritize the prevention of crying.\n\nThis is a teachable moment wasted.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s a very toddler thing. I have twins who went through a phase of \u2018MY mommy\u2019 that made me a little bananas. I got through it by reassuring them a lot and telling myself that eventually I would miss their attachment to me. \n\nYour husband should have looked for ways to make sure he could show his toddler affection while assuring the older kid that she is also loved. Letting things escalate is no good, but it shouldn\u2019t be all on you to manage.", "ESH. Why was this such a big deal?  This is not unusual behaviour for a grumpy baby and a 4 year old. He could have just moved the baby onto his lap or the other side. Everyone else shouldn\u2019t have even noticed let alone gotten into an argument about it.", "ESH except the dad.  Yes he could handle a jealous baby and his niece fighting for his attention, by himself - and he did.

To many players in this tango and it could have been sorted in less than 30 seconds.", "I think ESH because this was a growth moment for your child, to learn to share and that she doesn't just automatically get what she wants- and she ended up just getting what she wanted. So you should have supported your husband in de-escalating the situation so he didn't feel he had to \"give in\" just to calm her down.", "YTA your solution was to watch the two kiddlets cry when neither know how to process their emotions instead of intervening and just waiting for your husband to handle it. You could have taken your daughter to calm her down briefly considering she DID just wake up from a nap, and from seeing me friends toddler baby sister wake up from naps I know (sometimes) wake ups can be randomly emotional because they're tired", "NTA Why did they want you to interfere when your husband was handling it? I kind of do agree on taking her out of the room sooner, but it makes much more sense for him to do it since he was holding her.", "NTA - it\u2019s a bit sexist isn\u2019t it? Your husband had your daughter. Why did they ask you to take your daughter out if the room? Why aren\u2019t they mad at your husband?
