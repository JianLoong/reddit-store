Mother in law gets some soup (menudo) to go. We go to a Christmas tree farm with my kids about an hour from the city.

I thought it was, an issue of social anxiety, which is why I never said anything. But my husband asked her this year when she popped in, why she didn't join us.

It generally doesn\u2019t bother me anymore unless it is on a holiday.\n\nThere was on instance when we went out to a restaurant that my in-laws and them frequent at least once a week. We ordered a family style meal, and he said he wasn\u2019t eating anything, which was fine. What wasn\u2019t fine was when he broke out his to go boxes and snagged some food to go before we actually finished the meal. Almost every time he comes to my in-laws he says he isn\u2019t drinking and is the DD for the night for his wife. 5 mins later he has a pint glass full of vodka.\n\nHe also cheats at golf.

You have been too busy to eat leftovers for 2 days?", "Then your SIL is the asshole.

Maybe a response to the total effect of all the times her sister has overstepped in front of their parents and she was expected to just put up with it.\n\nyeah, I\u2019m kinda making that up, but I\u2019m guessing wife\u2019s resentment has been festering for a while.

This woman is something else.", "Thanksgiving breakfast sounds good, too. \ud83d\udc4d", "My favourite post-Thanksgiving meal is a leftover crustless quiche I make.  After a few days when I get sick of eating it I put everything leftover in a quiche.  Everything but the desserts that is.\n\nI put the meat, veggies, cranberry sauce, stuffing, etc. in a baking dish, sprinkle 1/3 cup flour over and toss to mix.  Mix together 6 to 9 eggs (bigger baking dish means more eggs as you want to almost fill the dish), 1/2 cup milk or creamer (for 6 eggs, for 9 eggs use 3/4 cups), salt & pepper, poultry seasoning, 1/2 to 2/3 cup shredded flavourful cheese like Gruy\u00e8re or smoked Gouda and pour over the leftovers and bake for about 30 to 40 mins at 375\u00b0C and voila a tasty new way to eat leftovers.  The flour over the leftovers creates a quasi crust and you can use literally ***any*** leftovers.  I\u2019ve made leftover quiche with Sunday pot roast dinner, spaghetti, lasagne, shepherds pie, Chinese food, sushi (yes, sushi) as you can use Italian seasoning, Chinese 5 spice seasoning, wasabi or any spices instead of the poultry season.  What ever you used to spice the food originally is the spice you add to boost the flavour of the quiche.", "We do scruffing - scrambled eggs and stuffing! It\u2019s really good! Try it with gravy", "And my kids tease me about loving Reddit. I learn all kinds of great things. I\u2019m saving your recipe, it sounds delicious!", "Just screen-shotted this for later, it sounds so good!", "We do something very similar...except we use the stuffing as the crust. We sometimes do a thanksgiving shepherds pie if there are leftover mashed potatoes (which there typically isn't),", "Another good idea! Thank you for sharing.", "Me too!"]}
