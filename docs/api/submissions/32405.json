You\u2019re both deciding what\u2019s best for Brother.  It\u2019s up to him and his wife now, so back off.  If he doesn\u2019t have the balls to tell SIL, sorry, will be vacationing with wife elsewhere, then that\u2019s a spousal issue.

You are guessing as much has she is.  She should include your brother and his wife in the planning, but it is not your role to force her to do that.\n\nIf she schedules him and he drops out, you get to say, \"I told you so!\"  Since you are neither him, his wife, nor her--and they are all fully functioning adults--you drop it there and enjoy the show.", "NAH but but why borrow trouble? She's now annoyed with you when this had nothing to do with you originally.\n\nI think you should stay out of it and let your brother, his wife and everyone else manage their own lives.", "Why would their dynamic significantly change if he was happy to go **last year**? Surely he didn't marry someone who wasn't already interwoven in his life. Even arranged marriages do not usually happen that fast.\n\nBut most importantly why are you getting involved? If he doesn't want it, or his wife doesn't they will say so themselves.", "You're Not exactly the asshole for reminding her of that, but it's also Not exactly appropriate to get involved in their travel planning, because it's Not ABOUT you. You should instead encourage your Brother and newSIL to actively speak up about travel plans that involve tjem", "NTA but it might be an idea to give your brother a heads up that your SIL is making plans without him and his wife\u2019s consideration. Then stay out of it. You e done all you can that\u2019s reasonable.", "NTA\n\nBut I do think the better thing to do is advise SIL to discuss this with Brother and his new wife instead of ignoring new wife\u2019s existence. It\u2019s not your choice to make in the end, maybe it is cool with new wife but we don\u2019t know because you\u2019d both have to ask her.", "ESH. You're both making things weird. She should not plan a trip for someone without asking them first. You don't need to invest this much energy into this situation.", "Uh....YTA. Mind your business and don't worry about things that don't actively/actually involve you?", "NTA, your sister in law is oblivious. The dynamics have changed and she can't expect to control over other peoples lives. I would just let it rest as at some point she'll find out the hard way. If it becomes a big issue then you can have your brother's back, if he needs it.", "YTA, and I think you may be jealous of their relationship.\n\n> I pointed out that my brother is married now so she couldn\u2019t make summer plans for him anymore\n\nWhy did you feel that you are entitled to say this to her?  I assume your brother is a grown adult (certainly old enough to be married), so let HIM work it out.", "YTA, because you're inserting yourself unnecessarily into their discussions.\n\nYour brother can speak for himself.", "NTA but u both need to stop speaking for him at this point. She can plan and he can deal with it however he wants . Not really ur business.", "why are you trying to speak on their behalf? let brother and wife put a stop to it. NAH", "YTA. None of your business, keep out of it.", "NAH\n\nBut I hope you enjoy the blowup she has when your brother laughs at her audacity.  Maybe she will luck out and the new wife will be a doormat happy to go along with someone else planning their life.", "NAH- you're probably right but this is not your problem. You shouldn't get involved", "Your spouse should be the one to tell her this", "NAH. but I'm baffled as to why you think it's your business. I'd drop it - they're all adults and capable of communicating without you inserting yourself.", "Your brother has to show the kind of man he is here. He chose to get married, he has responsibilities to his wife. He has to speak up for her. \n\nKeep your nose out of it, except if the wife is being mistreated or abused. She also has a voice she can use. Let them be adults..", "NAH.\n\nThat said, I get the urge to be right about things and to say them and suggest you consider whether you have a problem with sometimes doing that to your detriment. Sometimes, there is no benefit to arguing about it or insisting you\u2019re right. You\u2019re going to learn to get along with people better if you merely say \u201cOh, I\u2019m surprised he\u2019s not handling things differently now that he\u2019s married. Do you need to check with him and his wife about their travel plans, plans for children, etc. before making plans?\u201d and leave it at that, yes, even if she says no she\u2019s never need to before. She\u2019ll find out she\u2019s wrong soon enough, you don\u2019t need to prove it to her or try to force her to see it in the moment.\n\nYou were both speaking for your brother and his wife in this instance and it sounds like neither of you are 100% certain how both members of that couple thinks and feels or what they will ultimately decide. There was no need for either of you to insist you knew or engage in conflict about it. It\u2019s okay for people to have different opinions than you about something and for you to learn to move past it, even when they are wrong, especially in instances where there is nothing to be gained by doubling down on your point.\n\nIf you\u2019re right, and you probably are based on what you described, she\u2019ll figure it out soon enough herself. Sometimes a hint is equally powerful to insisting on something multiple times and this is one of those instances where nothing you said was necessary or helpful aside from pointing out that maybe she should consult with him before making plans. Quite frankly, the whole conversation sounds acrimonious and distasteful and I\u2019m not surprised she thinks you have a problem with her. Not letting the topic go after your initial comment didn\u2019t do you or anyone else any favors.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be involved at all and I can imagine it\u2019s irritating to others if you often insert yourself in things that aren\u2019t really your concern and insist you know best, even if you\u2019re right. It\u2019s not actually that different from what your SIL is doing. And your step-sister has clearly ended up in a position where both of you trust her enough to gossip about the other. I\u2019d question that a little, she\u2019s probably agreeing with each of you in turn.\n\nYou did make it a bit weird and I see why she\u2019s offended since you questioned her, she told you she didn\u2019t see an issue, and then you insisted you knew better than her and that there was one despite neither of you truly knowing for sure. There was just no need for it. You could have let your brother deal with it when the time came and gotten individual satisfaction out of being right without having to make a big deal about it now. Right now you repeatedly inserted yourself in something that wasn\u2019t your concern in a way that comes across as a bit controlling. Your SIL is similarly being controlling and assuming she knows best based on what has worked in the past. The thing is, it\u2019s not either of your place to say what your brother will or won\u2019t want to do and how it\u2019ll impact his wife and marriage. \n\nHe may decide to go, he may not. It\u2019s not any of your affair.", "Nta but let a grown adult deal with his own stuff.", "NTA.  Let her find out for herself and book the vacation.", "NTA.  You brought up a reasonable thought - SIL might not want to travel.    I would just sit back and watch this unfold.", "NTA, but I would advise you to stay out of it. When you get right down to it, none of this is any of your business. At all.  I'm sure your brother can handle it himself.", "NTA. You nearly pointed out the facts. He\u2019s married he doesn\u2019t get to run off for a summer vacation whenever he wants that\u2019s a joint decision now and she shouldn\u2019t be planning things for them without their permission.", "Nta. It\u2019s good you reminded her that he has a partner now and doing that is standing up for new wife. But stay out of it from now on. But I can totally see new wife posting here soon about her clueless overbearing new sil making plans for her husband without her. I can\u2019t wait to read that one.", "YTA\n\nThis is a reality she\u2019ll discover without your input. It feels like by speaking up you\u2019re making some sort of dig at her but I\u2019m not sure what or why. It\u2019s entirely unnecessary for you to offer input.", "Agree. NAH, but as they're all adults they are capable of arranging this all themselves. And if it turns out they're not, then they're adults and need to figure this new family dynamic out eventually, might as well start now.\n\nNone of these scenarios include you giving input before input is requested. (Even if you mean well.)", "Not his ex but the wife of their stepbrother, so their sister in law.", "There is no ex involved", "how does this at all say jealousy\u2026", "I see from the downvotes me and other yta votes are getting that we have a lot of meddlers in the mix today! Lol", "Agreed, tentative NAH, maybe even e s h  \nShe's making assumptions that nothing has changed, but you're making assumptions that everything WILL change.", "Sure you are, otherwise you wouldn't have brought it up. This was a situation that did not concern you at all, so let them work it out.", "Okay? That\u2019s also not your responsibility to manage. You gave her a gentle clue that this might not be a viable plan, but I don\u2019t see why you felt the need to keep pressing and turn it into a \u201cthing\u201d. Maybe she wastes her money. Maybe he goes and his wife gets irritated. Not your problem. \n\nThey\u2019re adults; let them handle their schedules/money/relationships as they see fit.", "Is it your money? No. So mind your own business. \nAt most you could have let your brother know what she was planning."]}
