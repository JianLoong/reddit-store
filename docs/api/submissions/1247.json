This is my friends story but the don\u2019t have Reddit so they\u2019ve asked me to post it on here for them.

About 2 years ago as we were walking out of school one day, R found a pin stuck into the bottom of their shoe; it was a cat reading a book. They thought it was cute so they then put it on their blazer and has been wearing it ever since. Around 3 weeks ago R comes up to me and says \u201cK said that the cat pin that I found on my shoe was theirs and want me to give it back to them but I haven\u2019t.\u201d We were both confused as K has known R for about 1-2 years now and hadn\u2019t asked for it before then. R then asked them why didn\u2019t they ask earlier because it was quite random to ask for it and K had no proof that it was theirs. K\u2019s response was \u201cI was really intimidated by you when I first noticed because you were really tall and kinda scary\u201d (R is 5\u20198/5\u20199, K is around 5ft) when I was told this I was kinda taken aback because K seemed really determined to get the pin back but said they were too scared earlier on. Like if you wanted and missed the pin so much then why wouldn\u2019t you want to get it as soon as possible. We also asked where they got it from and if they could of just gotten another one etc but they dodged the question which was really suspicious tbh. We also asked if they got it as a present and they said they bought it themselves. R didn\u2019t give K the pin and was avoiding K at all costs just so K didn\u2019t keep on bringing it up. It\u2019s was just so random and out of the blue.

Clearly K didn\u2019t care about it enough to ask for back sooner, even if they were \u201cintimidated\u201d. Like you said, there\u2019s no proof it\u2019 was even K\u2019s to begin with. I think your friend should just keep it. At the end of the day, it\u2019s just a pin", "YTA. Your friend *found* a pin, someone says it was theirs and they want it back.
