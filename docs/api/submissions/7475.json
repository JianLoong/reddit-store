Like at all. I (24 F) had divorced parents growing up so I spent every other thanksgiving, Christmas, and spring break with my dad, stepmom, and two younger half sisters. I also have a cousin on my dads side who is my exact age but she grew up on the west coast so I rarely ever got to see her growing up. Once I turned 18, I just kept with the usual visiting pattern as it made the most sense to me. \n\nFirst, some background:\n\nWell thanksgiving last year was probably my worst ever. I came up for the week only for SM and sisters to continuously ignore my existence while fawning over my cousin like she\u2019s the next coming of Christ. She\u2019s in nursing school while I\u2019m getting a PhD in math. My SM would always brag about her to me growing up, telling me I should be more like her while always sending her expensive gifts for Christmas. Well the night before thanksgiving, SM begins the ass-kissing of my cousin by exclaiming how she\u2019ll be such a great nurse who will make far more money than anyone in the room. She then turns to me and says very snippily \u201cit\u2019s not like you\u2019ll ever make as much as her while working in academia!\u201d  I responded that as long as I make tenure it\u2019s definitely possible and that her comment was rude and unnecessary. Stepmom begins to shake her head laughing at me and nobody bothers to stick up for me, not even my own cousin. Stepmom followed me up to my room and called me out for being \u2018disrespectful\u2019, which I definitely wasn\u2019t being. I then broke it to her that the she is the sole reason I don\u2019t visit often at all.  Thanksgiving the next day was super awkward, and I left the next day without helping to clean up (she doesn\u2019t deserve my help after how she treated me). \n\nThanksgiving of this year (2023) I\u2019m \u201csupposed to\u201d spend it at my dads, but after talking on the phone with my maternal aunt, she insisted I just spend it with her family instead (they actually treat me pretty well & are a lot more fun!). So v\u00edola\u2026\u2026.that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing! \n\nI\u2019m planning to wait until Octoberish to break the news to SM and everyone that I\u2019m not coming. I\u2019m not at all about \u2018softening the blow\u2019 for them, as they treated me like dirt last time & probably will again if given the opportunity. I also feel if I wait until right before, the shock they may feel might just teach them a lesson about not treating your own family like dirt, and they wouldn\u2019t have enough time in advance to invite our other family members in place of me.

That is incredibly AH behaviour, maybe if you too showed some love and support to your family you would get some back. You also sound incredibly entitled and petty  \"she doesn\u2019t deserve my help after how she treated me\". Was she the only one who needed help?

I love to see him and we are close but he lives in another state so I don\u2019t see him often, but adults aren\u2019t expected to maintain any kind of visiting schedule and it\u2019s odd to assume frankly.  I do agree that OP is overthinking it and I think it\u2019s likely because they hope the family will give a damn but it doesn\u2019t seem like they really do other than to purposely antagonize them.", "She said she's telling them October-ish, which is not last minute. Even if she told them last minute, I don't know that having one fewer person would affect their plans that much. It would definitely do more damage to the relationship, but it's up to OP to figure out how much that relationship matters to her.", "Found the cousin's account.", "If she is jealous of the cousin because her family fostered that dynamic. None of the rest of the family spoke up to defend her or defuse the situation (which was framed absurdly aggressively to start with - and apparently ignored the fact that nurses aren\u2019t really big-time earners mostly?). I have no idea what OP\u2019s relationship with their dad is, I didn\u2019t notice him mentioned much, but if people treat you badly why put your back out to help them?", "I don't know when Thanksgiving is, Novemberish I thought but I'm British so don't celebrate it. I was just referring to the fact that she said she wants to leave it to the last minute so they don't have time to invite someone in her place. It's only SM she seems to have an issue with, why not let them know sooner. Not letting them know out of spite seems like an AH thing to do to me."]}
