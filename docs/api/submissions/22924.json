He's a nice kid but unfortunately, as I found out a few days ago, a chronic bedwetter. That evening when we had dinner, he drank this tall glass of water with some chips. The next morning he wasn't up in time for breakfast so I checked his room and found he'd wet the bed. And not for the first time, when I confronted him about it he admitted he'd wet the bed before but hid it from us by getting up early and washing the sheets. Now, neither of his parents told me anything about this, and Zack told me he'd fooled them into thinking that he'd gotten over it and could I please not tell them.\n\nI wasn't too mad because I understand it's not something he can control, but I did make a rule that he has to limit his fluid intake (no sodas, soft drinks, soups, etc.) and that after 7:00 P.M he can't drink any beverages. He's free to break the rules of course, but if he wets the bed again and I find out, I made it clear I'm telling his folks. \n\nMy wife and I got into an argument over it when she found Zack was still awake at like 4:00 A.M. Last night. She's insistent that he's scared to sleep because he might wet the bed and it's because of the \u201cthreat\u201d I made to tell his parents. Now, I don't know if she forgot what it's like to be a teenager, but they stey up at bizarre hours all the time. It's not necessarily due to the bedwetting at all, and I told her as much. If he's following the rules he probably won't wet the bed anyhow. She called me a \u201ccold motherf'er\u201d and has been giving me the silent treatment since.\n\nI don't think I did anything wrong; it's not a \u201cthreat\u201d per se, telling parents is just the right thing to do if a kid keeps having issues.

OP, your nephew has a serious medical problem, which could be nocturnal enuresis. The fact that he is 14 sounds should raise alarm bells, and he needs to see a doctor immediately, not have his fluid intake restricted without a proper diagnosis.

Get your nephew some help, and also apologize to your nephew and your wife for acting like a jerk.", "YTA. It can be a red flag that a 14 year old is still wetting the bed. It could be a sign of abuse. Do you know of a medical condition? If not, you need to start getting way more concerned.", "YTA\n\nI wet the bed til I was twelve. This is a red flag. Both that he is wetting the bed and that he is scared for his parents to find out.\n\nFor me it was a combination of two things - trauma (parents abusive behind closed doors) and undiagnosed autism (so issues with interoception which is common with autism)\n\nYour nephew needs help - not shame.", "You are a complete ASSHOLE. If the teenager is wetting the bed at 14 years old than scaring the child is not going to do shit. Chances are he has a medical issue or is suffering from other external factors.", "[deleted]", "YTA. You saw a FOURTEEN YEAR OLD doing something most kids grow out of by half his age at most and thought the appropriate response was \"I'm telling!\"? Really? And you're not sure if you're an asshole for that? Omfg, I swear some of y'all post here acting intentionally dense in the hope that we'll ignore your asshole behaviors because we sympathize with your foolishness. \n\nWhat exactly is your problem? This boy literally cleaned up and remedied his own situation. What actual benefit do you anticipate by switching to his parents? Are you even remotely aware of the extremely concerning reasons WHY kids his age might still be wetting the bed? Have you bothered to so much as Google \"bed wetting at 14\" or is your actual concern \"ew, that's gross! I'm telling your parents unless you allow yourself to become dehydrated if you don't drink an adequate amount before 7pm.\" ?\n\nI genuinely do not understand your stance here unless it's some sort of power move.\n\nAnd as for the bit about teenagers having weird sleep/wake schedules, 2 questions. \n\n1. Was he also staying up this late into the night/early into the morning BEFORE you discovered the bedwetting? \n\nAnd\n\n2. If he WAS staying up past 4AM and sleeping late before your little call-out/threats, did you factor that into your decision to restrict his liquid intake past 7pm?\n\nWhy any person would willfully spend time with an asshole like yourself is baffling, and may point to *why* your nephew would rather spend time with someone who degrades, threatens and punishes him for something out of his control than in his own home.\n\nAnd tbh, I'm still stuck on my earlier question. If he's taking steps to clean any mess he makes to the point where you didn't notice at first, what exactly is your issue here? Because it's obvious that his well-being is NOT your primary concern.", "YTA \n\nInstead of threatening him and making him nervous, how about the approach of helping come up with a solution? As a former kid who wet the bed until almost middle school because I was just a super heavy sleeper, it SUCKED. I\u2019m so glad my dad didn\u2019t do what you did, but instead told me he\u2019d help me come up with a solution because I couldn\u2019t be the only one (I wasn\u2019t), and then found a solution. They make devices to help kids wake up and I\u2019m a testament that they work. \n\nChange your tune there, dude. It\u2019s not an intentional thing. He\u2019s embarrassed and already stressed about it, so why not help?", "**YTA**   Your nephew has a medical problem and you think the answer is dehydration?   Instead of threatening him, assure him that you want him to be comfortable in your home.    Ensure that there are spare sheets available (and a plastic cover if possible) and remind  him that he's responsible for his own laundry \n  \nIf you actually want to help him, ask him if he's talked to his doctor about this.", "YTA, if you honestly believed it was a matter his parents needed to know - you'd have simply told them, not leveraged the threat against him of telling them. Since you instead chose the threat, you know it's not necessary for them to find out about his issue - therefore you're only using it as a weapon.", "YTA\n\nYou are basically blackmailing your nephew.\n\u201cDo this or I tell your parents\u201d.\n\nYou could have taken the opportunity when he opened up to you to talk to him about why it\u2019s important that HE let his parents know what\u2019s going on. \nInstead you threatened him with telling his parents. \n\nBad move.", "YTA. Do you really think he\u2019s doing it on purpose? Drinking water has nothing to do with it, and telling his parents something they almost surely know just to humiliate him is cruel. Get a plastic mattress cover and gently mention it to the parent who is related to you. If they are your wife\u2019s family keep out of it.", "YTA\n\nTelling parents about an issue a kid is having is fine but YOU made sure he knew it was a threat. Stop wetting the bed or I\u2019m telling your parents. That\u2019s a threat. \n\nIt\u2019s not okay for the kid to wet his bed still and be so terrified about it. Ya\u2019ll need to either help him or stop scaring him and just have him go home.", "YTA for treating him a fucking Gremlin.\n\nWhat kind of lunatic disallows a child from drinking water? I mean, what if he can't sleep for whatever reason? Is he then supposed to wait until sunrise to be able to drink water?\n\nThe correct course of action would of course have been to comfort and support him as much as possible given the extremely embarrassing nature of the problem, and then just laying out some extra protection under the sheets. A few layers of plastic bags would've worked just fine.\n\nIf he'd then happen to wet his bed because he had the audacity to drink a cup of water after dinner then just wash the sheets like a sane human being.", "YTA  Several people have given you reasons why a 14 year old would still be wetting the bed. Physical or sexual abuse or a medical condition. He needs help. Not to be humiliated. He needs to see a doctor to be diagnosed, to find out what's wrong. No 14 year old is intentionally wetting the bed, and he's not doing it because he's lazy. Offer him help, not humiliation. Why would you think it's funny? Would you think it was funny if he was being physically or sexually abused? Would you think it was funny if he had a medical problem? Be an adult and ask him what's wrong. Help him.", "Yes YTA for threatening him. It's obviously not something he could control or else he wouldn't do it and maybe you should figure out what may be the problem because there are a lot of reasons kids wet the bed like that, one of them being abuse. I'm not saying he's being abused but maybe instead of trying to scare him, try to help him first.", "YTA. Limiting his fluid intake does nothing but dehydrate him. He will still most likely have a bed wetting incident and you have completely terrified him. \n\nYes, his parents need to be made aware because he has a medical issue or is being abused by someone. Instead of trying to help him realize he needs assistance, you scared him.", "Putting aside AH or not - He needs to see a doctor he could have diabetes or another serious condition.", "bed wetting at 14 can be a red flag for abuse, instead of stressing the poor kid out even more and snitching on him why don\u2019t you try being compassionate?! YTA, do you even hear yourself?!", "YTA. You don\u2019t \u201cthreaten\u201d a bedwetter. You help them.", "Has anyone in all of this sat down with your nephew and asked him in a no judgement, supportive setting if everything is ok and talked to him about it and what he thinks about it? He\u2019s 14 so he may not open up but has anyone even tried this? Maybe there are things he has been noticing or experiencing when it happens that may help point to a cause but he doesn\u2019t know how to raise it for fear of judgement. He\u2019s clearly very embarrassed about the whole situation and your reaction has not helped one bit.\n\nI think as long as his parents are not the cause of the issues (e.g. they abuse him) then they quietly need to be told to get him some help but at 14 I think your nephew needs to be given a chance to open up in a supportive setting first and been made aware that his parents need to be told. \n\nMost definitely YTA for your reaction. You\u2019ve likely lost any trust your nephew had in you and it will not be easy to get it back", "YTA\n\nYou know, some people are bedwetters into adulthood and beyond. It depends on so many factors, not just fluid intake, and scaring them is not a recommended treatment.\n\nDo you really want to help, or do you just want less trouble for yourself?", "At this point, it's medically necessary that his parents know. He needs to get help with that and hiding it might be hurting him more than he realizes.", "YTA. Wetting the bed at that age could be a sign of abuse. Let your home be a safe space, be patient, and keep a line of communication open.", "YTA for not asking your nephew how you can help. The young man needs some support and assessment, not rules and threats. \n\nIt could be emotional, it could be physical, it could be a trauma response, and the lines of communication need to be opened to figure out how to best proceed.", "YTA can you imagine what it's like to be a teen with that concern? I'd get him a plastic sheet to protect the mattress and tell him to wash his own bedding and make it not a big deal.", "For my kid it was a deficiency in a neurotransmitter. The doc gave him a nasal spray to take before bed and by the time he finished the spray his neurotransmitter production had caught up to his large size. Please tell his parents that he needs to see a doctor for help, not for blame.", "1) tell the parents, this is a medical issue they should be aware of\n2) get a water proof liner for the bed so none of y\u2019all have to worry", "YTA, for the threat. I wet the bed (and not just that, I would pee myself when I was awake too, I just couldn\u2019t hold it) until I was I dunno, 7 or 8 maybe. My dad would rage and scream and hit me and humiliate me and push my face into it like a dog.  There\u2019s a reason he doesn\u2019t want you to tell them. It might not be like my family but you never know. I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t know what you SHOULD do but please maybe sit him down and talk to him about it before involving his parents.", "I'm saying mostly the AH but it's redeemable.\n\nPediatricians recommend cutting off fluid hours before bed for bed wetters. So I don't feel like him cutting off fluid is an ah move.\n\nSaying \"if it happens again I'm going to tell your parents,\" was not the move. As a teen that statement was terrifying to me, I was not a bad kid. I'm sorry, but family or not, you have no idea what's going on behind closed doors. \n\nSit down with your nephew,  talk to him,  ask him if he thinks there might be anything going on. But compassion and understanding and an ear from his uncle, who the kids clearly loves could go a long way. It honestly could be that he's just a deep sleeper. Tell him you were only mentioning telling his parents because you were concerned about his health,  not that you were mad, and apologize if it came off that way. \n\nTalk to the parents, and if they show any sign of being mad, call them on that shit. Tell them to chill it's not a choice. Talk to them about the monitor that is supposed to wake him up. Plastic mattress covers. Limiting fluid before bed. Taking him to a doctor. The doctor is going to give those same recommendations, but also may want to do a sleep study, know from experience. We thought it was just because my little brother was overweight but it was also related to hormone changes- that could be it too, boys going through major hormone changes during puberty isn't talked about enough. It's an embarrassing thing. He doesn't need to be humiliated. \n\nMy kid wet the bed last year as a teenager, I already have mattress covers because I have a fear of my kids getting sick in the night and having to clean throw up and the smell out of a mattress so that wasn't an issue, but he was super embarrassed at first. Dude was knocked tf out because we had a long busy day out at the lake. I was not mad,  frustrated,  annoyed,  just told him to get cleaned up and laundry started and I used disinfectant wipes to clean the cover and replaced his sheets while he did the rest. \n\nTo posters saying the uncle should do something about it, I'm slightly confused because my kids' aunt and uncle could take them to the ER but they can't just make dr. appts for my kids. Is that just something people do?", "Tell his parents, they need to know about his son's health", "I'm going to have to go against the grain and say NAH. I think you could've handled it differently but until he gets a hold on things limiting his fluid intake after a certain time is a reasonable solution. I just had a talk with my doctor where she recommended that I don't let my toddler drink after a certain time or have a tippy cup in his crib. My aunts pediatrician recommended that for her child a few months ago to help potty train her. I know lots of parents who do this to help potty train. If he's not waking up to pee he's not getting dehydrated enough in the night to wake up and need water either. \n\nI feel like getting him a waterproof mattress topper for the time being is smart and I feel like you just need to have a talk with him and explain that you need to talk with his parents and have them take him to see his doctor no matter how embarrassing. You didn't have bad intentions, you gave him a fair choice that lots of parents give their kids. I understand his reaction because no kid that age wants to admit something that embarrassing especially to his parents who probably shamed him about it too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There is a slight possibility that there is something medically wrong here, but it's much more likely that there's something psychological going on, and mental health issues are NEVER successfully dealt with through either shame or discipline.

Or it may be the case that they\u2019d give him the support he needs to stop wetting the bed, but in that case it should be *his* decision. Focus your efforts on getting him to see that telling his parents is the sensible thing to do; you found out in one week, it\u2019s only a matter of time before they find out, there\u2019s help to get for wetting the bed and your parents has to be involved for him to get that help, offer to be there as his support when he tells them in case he\u2019s worried about their reaction, etc.", "YTA - fear is the reason for bed wetting.
