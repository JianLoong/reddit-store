We have a good relationship, both in steady jobs, we own a home. Since first meeting Ben's family they have been so welcoming and really made me feel at ease. This story relates to Ben's brother's girlfriend. Tom (35M) and Alison (27F) have been together for 3 years, she has children from a previous relationship and they do not live together. \n\nAlison has always been jealous of how we have progressed our relationship but her and Tom haven't. They don't live together as he won't support her financially, she doesn't work and they aren't engaged or anything.\n\nWhen Ben and I started dating he told me his family have never understood why Tom is with Alison. She is unemployed (by choice she will not work and is very open about claiming government support), her children she had before the age of 16 are nightmares, she does not discipline them or show any interest in them at all (they are forbidden from coming to Ben's family home as they drew over the walls and were incredibly badly behaved the first and only time they did - for reference they are 12 and 11 AKA old enough to not be at that shit). \n\nI've never been rude to Alison or made her feel uncomfortable. I am always civil because at the end of the day I don't agree with her lifestyle but that's none of my business and Tom clearly is with her for a reason. Anytime we are at family events I always make sure to ask about the kids etc. Yesterday Tom showed up at our house after they had an argument and wanted someone to talk to. I was shocked when he told me what had started the argument. Last Saturday we were all at a birthday party for their grandma. Ben's auntie arrived at the party and came over to me, gave me a hug and we chatted. Alison witnessed this and later started an argument because 'your auntie has never spoken to me like that'. Also spewing all this rubbish about them liking me better and how I make her feel inadequate, which yeah they probably do but how is that my fault? She called me a 'kiss ass' because I made Ben's mother a crocheted blanket (this is my part time business so it's not like I went out of my way to learn a skill). I don't pass comment on other people's relationships, I really don't care but I snapped and just said 'fuck off how immature can you be' (this is out of character for me but I had enough of being made to be like this monster for simply existing). Tom was taken back that I said this, and took the attitude of I shouldn't say that because at the end of the day she's his girlfriend. I can't remember exactly what I said but it was along the lines ''what am I meant to feel guilty for here? Having a job? Not being a teenage mother? It's not my responsibility to validate her shitty life choices and make her feel welcome, it's your family' \n\nTom left immediately and now won't speak to Ben or return his calls.

No she even states its NONE OF HER BUSINESS however Alison made shit her business when she tossed allllllllllll of it right on OP for simply trying to be a functioning adult.

That's not whats making her an AH, that's her behaviour, no need to drag up other facts in a bad way. \nMaybe soft Y t a for that but overall it's hard to react calmly to it and you have shown a lot of civility towards her before so I'm going to go with NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

FFS.\n\nI feel like banging my head on the wall, so let me re-ask this entire thread: when Alison is shittalking OP, why can't OP just be mad at her for shittalking instead of for being a teenage mom? Why is her teenage momhood a relevant thing for OP to drag when complaining about her? Why not just focus on the actual toxic behavior, ffs?", "Tell me you didn't read my comment without telling me you didn't read my comment....\n\nI already said (twice) that I recognise that getting pregnant as a teen is not always about choice - and two kids before the age of 16 is *rarely* about choice or even consent. BUT deciding to keep the baby and take on the parenting role *is* a choice. And it is a hard one, and it can be (and probably was) complicated due to limited options, but it was still a choice Allison made at the time and one she continues to make. It happened within whatever context her life was in at the time, and I have no doubt that there was some kind of trauma involved - being a parent at any age can be incredibly difficult, being a young parent is especially hard. \n\nAnd yes, being a teen parent means that your life is going to look different to someone who becomes a parent in their late 20s, their 30s or their 40s. I was a young parent - not as young as Allison, but still young, and looked younger - and there are \"formative\" life experiences other people my age had that I simply missed out on because I was busy being a young single mum. I had to put further education on hold. It impacted my ability to get a job. I had no social life. I had little family support. We were poor. I did my best. And sometimes my best sucked. *Believe me, I get it.* \n\nI'm still responsible for managing the outcomes of my choices. Even if they were choices that weren't always made in perfect circumstances. Being a young parent didn't mean I was not capable of teaching my child to not draw on other people's walls or behaving appropriately. Being a young parent didn't mean I could just ignore my own agency in my own life. Being a young parent didn't mean I had an excuse to yell and shout at other people because I was jealous or envious of their lives or their relationships. I might have (definitely did at times) *feel* that way, but that didn't mean I got to call people names. \n\nLook, you might not like the language of \"she chose not to have a job, she chose to be a parent\" - but those ARE choices she has made and is continuing to make. She is very clear on her active choice not to get a job. She is very clear on not only being a parent, but actively parenting in a way that means her children aren't welcome at other people's houses. Those are choices that she, as an adult, is making right now. She isn't a teenager anymore. She is 27. She has options available to her now that she didn't have when she was 14/15/16. If there is trauma around those things *then she is also responsible for seeking support for that.* Because she is now an *adult* and she needs and deserves to get whatever help she can to grow as a person and a parent. \n\nWhat she does not deserve is people enabling her poor behaviour, or saying \"BUT TRAUMA\" as if that wipes out her own agency or responsibility. That only ends up infantalising her, and treating her as if she has no understanding or self control. She deserves better support than that. \n\nAnd lol at sounding like a conservative. If only - it might make my life easier if I wasn't the resident greenie hippy banging on about community gardens and mutual obligation everywhere I went. But here we are, where saying \"taking on the responsibility of being a teen parent doesn't give you the right to be an asshole\" is \"you're a conservative\"\n\nNo one *here* is shaming Allison for being a teen parent. We're just not accepting that it means she gets a free pass to call people names or treat people like shit.", "OP is shaming Allison for being a teen parent. OP says ''what am I meant to feel guilty for here? Having a job? Not being a teenage mother?\"\n\nOP's tone and words implies that being a teenage mother is something to feel guilty over.

But is OP an *asshole* for it? I don't think so. Allison is fine with her own choices when it gets her what she wants. That doesn't mean she gets to then use them as an excuse to be a jerk, and then act surprised when yes, someone calls her out on the unreasonableness of her behaviour. Allison is going to meet many people in her life that have made different choices or whose lives have had different outcomes. None of those people are required to feel guilty or bad simply because their lives are different, and Allison has no right to try and make them feel guilty or bad because their lives are different. \n\nIn the end, OP didn't \"call her out\" for being a teenaged mum.

If her 11 and 12 year old kids have no boundaries and think it's okay to color on the walls of other people's homes, they have been drug up instead of raised. Their unruly behavior has caused them to be unwelcome in the home of others. \n\nIf you can't afford to stay at home and provide for your children, then you can't afford to be a stay at home mom. That's where the judgment comes in. Bragging about her commitment to staying on the taxpayer dollar is not aspirational."]}
