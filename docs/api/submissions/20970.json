We have a good relationship, both in steady jobs, we own a home. Since first meeting Ben's family they have been so welcoming and really made me feel at ease. This story relates to Ben's brother's girlfriend. Tom (35M) and Alison (27F) have been together for 3 years, she has children from a previous relationship and they do not live together. \n\nAlison has always been jealous of how we have progressed our relationship but her and Tom haven't. They don't live together as he won't support her financially, she doesn't work and they aren't engaged or anything.\n\nWhen Ben and I started dating he told me his family have never understood why Tom is with Alison. She is unemployed (by choice she will not work and is very open about claiming government support), her children she had before the age of 16 are nightmares, she does not discipline them or show any interest in them at all (they are forbidden from coming to Ben's family home as they drew over the walls and were incredibly badly behaved the first and only time they did - for reference they are 12 and 11 AKA old enough to not be at that shit). \n\nI've never been rude to Alison or made her feel uncomfortable. I am always civil because at the end of the day I don't agree with her lifestyle but that's none of my business and Tom clearly is with her for a reason. Anytime we are at family events I always make sure to ask about the kids etc. Yesterday Tom showed up at our house after they had an argument and wanted someone to talk to. I was shocked when he told me what had started the argument. Last Saturday we were all at a birthday party for their grandma. Ben's auntie arrived at the party and came over to me, gave me a hug and we chatted. Alison witnessed this and later started an argument because 'your auntie has never spoken to me like that'. Also spewing all this rubbish about them liking me better and how I make her feel inadequate, which yeah they probably do but how is that my fault? She called me a 'kiss ass' because I made Ben's mother a crocheted blanket (this is my part time business so it's not like I went out of my way to learn a skill). I don't pass comment on other people's relationships, I really don't care but I snapped and just said 'fuck off how immature can you be' (this is out of character for me but I had enough of being made to be like this monster for simply existing). Tom was taken back that I said this, and took the attitude of I shouldn't say that because at the end of the day she's his girlfriend. I can't remember exactly what I said but it was along the lines ''what am I meant to feel guilty for here? Having a job? Not being a teenage mother? It's not my responsibility to validate her shitty life choices and make her feel welcome, it's your family' \n\nTom left immediately and now won't speak to Ben or return his calls.

No she even states its NONE OF HER BUSINESS however Alison made shit her business when she tossed allllllllllll of it right on OP for simply trying to be a functioning adult.

That's not whats making her an AH, that's her behaviour, no need to drag up other facts in a bad way. \nMaybe soft Y t a for that but overall it's hard to react calmly to it and you have shown a lot of civility towards her before so I'm going to go with NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
