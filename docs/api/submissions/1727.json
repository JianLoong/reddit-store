And I got some water on my phone awhile ago that\u2019s made my screen go a little crazy. So please try to ignore any mistakes. \n\nMe nor my fianc\u00e9e want kids at our wedding. And that shouldn\u2019t be a problem, plenty of people put that on invitations all the time and it\u2019s fine. My fianc\u00e9 (24m) and his sister (21) are the youngest in their family by a good 10 years, so no problem there. And my family doesn\u2019t have a lot of kids either. My maternal uncle and his wife have 2 kids (7m and 5f), and my paternal aunt also has 2 (12m and 6m). And that\u2019s it. And again, normally I wouldn\u2019t even have a second thought. But in 2019 at my oldest cousins wedding, she also specified no kids, and both of my aunts very deliberately ignored this rule and just brought their kids anyway. I think that is so disrespectful and so rude. I understand not being able to get childcare, but I know for an absolute FACT that these two could easily get childcare options. My aunt with the boys is divorced, and I don\u2019t know her ex husband well so he wouldn\u2019t be invited anyway. Why cant he watch them? The boys are there every weekend anyway. And my other aunt is absolutely loaded, and they have a regular nanny for the kids because mom and dad work full time. There\u2019s no excuse. They\u2019re doing it on purpose, not out of necessity.\n\nSo I plan to get the \u201cno children welcome\u201d message out very early, so our friends with children can find accommodations. I have complete faith that they will respect our request. But there is something in my SOUL that is telling me my family are absolutely going to ignore me and bring their kids anyway. They did it to my cousin, what\u2019s stopping them from doing it again? So I\u2019ve decided to make it a demand, not a request. Here\u2019s the asshole part. I feel so strongly about this that I\u2019m 100% ready and willing to turn them away at the door. I\u2019m honestly planning on it at this point. My wealthy aunts kids are absolute nightmares. The most spoiled brats I\u2019ve ever met. (I feel evil talking so negatively about a child but I know they would ruin the day). The two boys are actually pretty well behaved and probably wouldn\u2019t bother anyone, but It has to be all or nothing. It\u2019s not fair to just exclude some of the kids. But on top of all that, I think it\u2019s just the principle. You can\u2019t respect someone enough to follow one simple request on their wedding day? That bothers me enough to make a stink and go a little bridezilla on them. Im usually pretty go with the flow of life, but this is a hill I\u2019m willing to die on. \n\n\nPlease let me know if I\u2019m planning to go about this in an asshole-ish way.

Have you sent the invitations out yet? Depending on how you feel about the aunts, maybe called them, let them know your wedding will be childfree, and ask them if the will accommodate your wishes. If they say no, tell them, \"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that,\" and don't send them an invitation. If they say yes, tell them: that's great, the invitations will indicate no kids are allowed you just wanted to make sure they can make that work, and that no children will be allowed in.\n\nTurn them away at the door if they bring their kids.

If you can get bouncers from the hotel venue itself that is great.   \n\n\nIt's fairly rare, but I have seen entrance checks for larger weddings and  in places where there are multiple events. They don't request a copy of the invite but they have the guest list and check off people as they arrive. To make it friendly, there are generally a couple family members around identify people as they arrive and who makes sure that beloved Uncle Ned is allowed in even though it doesn't match Alfred Whizzbanger on the guest list.  It's also a nice way to confirm that the seating arrangements for the meal will all be correct.   \n\n\nSo they can officially refuse entry for the aunts. And ideally, they remove them from the entrance to someplace less central (but not inside the venue) to \"discuss this with someone who can help them\". That person will tell them the kids aren't invited and verysorrybuttheycan't comein. Then they can fume outside and alone.    \n\n\nSo you don't kick them out personally (which is stressy and drama filled) . They are denied entry by your designate (relaxing and calm).", "Nta your wedding it\u2019s your day your rules update us I really want to know if they are entitled enough to think they can do as they pleaee this just pisses me off \u2026.
