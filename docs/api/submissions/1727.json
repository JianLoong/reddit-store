And I got some water on my phone awhile ago that\u2019s made my screen go a little crazy. So please try to ignore any mistakes. \n\nMe nor my fianc\u00e9e want kids at our wedding. And that shouldn\u2019t be a problem, plenty of people put that on invitations all the time and it\u2019s fine. My fianc\u00e9 (24m) and his sister (21) are the youngest in their family by a good 10 years, so no problem there. And my family doesn\u2019t have a lot of kids either. My maternal uncle and his wife have 2 kids (7m and 5f), and my paternal aunt also has 2 (12m and 6m). And that\u2019s it. And again, normally I wouldn\u2019t even have a second thought. But in 2019 at my oldest cousins wedding, she also specified no kids, and both of my aunts very deliberately ignored this rule and just brought their kids anyway. I think that is so disrespectful and so rude. I understand not being able to get childcare, but I know for an absolute FACT that these two could easily get childcare options. My aunt with the boys is divorced, and I don\u2019t know her ex husband well so he wouldn\u2019t be invited anyway. Why cant he watch them? The boys are there every weekend anyway. And my other aunt is absolutely loaded, and they have a regular nanny for the kids because mom and dad work full time. There\u2019s no excuse. They\u2019re doing it on purpose, not out of necessity.\n\nSo I plan to get the \u201cno children welcome\u201d message out very early, so our friends with children can find accommodations. I have complete faith that they will respect our request. But there is something in my SOUL that is telling me my family are absolutely going to ignore me and bring their kids anyway. They did it to my cousin, what\u2019s stopping them from doing it again? So I\u2019ve decided to make it a demand, not a request. Here\u2019s the asshole part. I feel so strongly about this that I\u2019m 100% ready and willing to turn them away at the door. I\u2019m honestly planning on it at this point. My wealthy aunts kids are absolute nightmares. The most spoiled brats I\u2019ve ever met. (I feel evil talking so negatively about a child but I know they would ruin the day). The two boys are actually pretty well behaved and probably wouldn\u2019t bother anyone, but It has to be all or nothing. It\u2019s not fair to just exclude some of the kids. But on top of all that, I think it\u2019s just the principle. You can\u2019t respect someone enough to follow one simple request on their wedding day? That bothers me enough to make a stink and go a little bridezilla on them. Im usually pretty go with the flow of life, but this is a hill I\u2019m willing to die on. \n\n\nPlease let me know if I\u2019m planning to go about this in an asshole-ish way.

Child-free weddings were the norm in my extended family. I remember being in my early 20s and still not getting invites. That was never a problem for me though. It was usually members of my extended family who I barely recognized as family. \n\nINFO: In regards to the ex-husband is he involved in their lives? What is their custody agreement like? Is he allowed to see them without supervision? Is he allowed to spend time with them at all?", "NTA. It's fine to turn away uninvited guests.", "NTA. We had a child free wedding and I have no regrets. Several family members chose not to attend in protest and I didn\u2019t care. You\u2019re allowed to have a child free wedding and they\u2019re allowed to choose not to come - but they\u2019re not allowed to disregard your wishes.

Be clear in the invitations and maybe drop a hint or ten in advance to your mum or dad (depending on which side of the family it is) that the venue is under strict orders to deny entry to anyone with children. That way no one can claim ignorance and they will be exposed for TAs they really are.", "NTA If you are sure they will pull this they are already making it so there can be no drama-free option here (unless you allow them to run roughshod over you). This being the case, I'd either hire a bouncer or two and tell them that families who bring kids in defiance of your very clearly stated wishes *will* without exception be bounced -- or I'd just not invite those people at all in the first place, telling them that their behavior at your cousin's wedding has shown that they refuse to respect people's expressed wishes at their weddings and so you are forced to take preventative measures to prevent the same thing occurring again, this time at your wedding.\n\nIf there is going to be drama anyway it might as well be all on your terms and done so they can't ruin the day itself.

I\u2019d go ahead and assign a friend to watch the door and if someone shows up with kids, they can kindly escort them away. And if they put up a stink, your friend can call the cops.\n\nI would take an extra step though and call and talk to these relatives and let them know that\u2019s the plan. They disregarded it before so they need to know you\u2019re not kidding and they won\u2019t get a pass at your wedding.\n\nAlternatively, you could simply not invite them.", "NTA just make sure to put on the invites that anyone who shows up with kids will be turned away at the door, and put someone at the door to do that.", "NTA.  Hire a bouncer.", "Having a child free wedding is pretty common now. I've seen other posts about having someone stationed at the entrance who turns guests away that don't follow the rules.

It could make family gatherings uncomfortable for years to come.", "NTA\n\nI'd even either approach them directly beforehand, or have your parents do it, to tell them in no uncertain terms that if they show up with their kids, they'll be turned away.\n\nAlso, hire security.", "Nta\n\nIf they don't respect your rule, that means they don't respect you, and I wouldn't want someone that doesn't respect me at my wedding.", "NTA. Your not a bridezilla for making that request. For weddings, it's not a crazy request. In fact, based on your past experience, I would recommend you take it one step further and specifically tell your aunt (or whoever else has a history of ignoring these requests) that you plan to fully uphold this rule and they will not be welcome to the wedding if they bring kids. Set the expectation up in advance so they are not surprised and cause a scene.", "NTA you already made it clear that it's a childfree wedding and if someone is going to be disrespecting  this by intentionally bringing their kids then you absolutely have the right to ask them leave.\nYou might want to hire security just in case they start having a kerfuffle about it and won't leave.", "NTA it\u2019s your wedding.

Your wedding, your rules. It's entirely reasonable to request that no children be present at the wedding.   \n\n\nSome people are just so ridiculously entitled and narcissistic that they feel everyone should bend to their will and whims.
