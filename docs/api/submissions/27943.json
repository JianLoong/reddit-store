Since the cover might be too obvious, I suggest you take the long road, and plant yourself a few thick bushes strategically surrounding your mailbox, and, in one or two years maximum, you will have everything you need to start collecting proof! The time needed for the bushes to grow also gives you extra time to enroll your volunteers into art classes in order to learn how to make quick facial sketches. While positioning your bush-guards, also make sure to mail letters to yourself every single day, so you can keep track of the mail efficiency.\n\nThis plan also needs: a horse, eight rolls of rope, a swordmaster, honey, wood and a dog not bigger than an owl. \n\nEveryone counts on you to finally avenge the spam!", "That's your problem.
