I\u2019m admittedly quite bad/good at sharing my address online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt first, I shrugged it off, but then I started noticing absurdly growing piles of what seemed like newspapers, magazines, and other mail behind Bob\u2019s window. It was an obscene amount of paper, suspiciously more than any sane person should be receiving.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFuelled by my suspicions, I resolved to confront Bob. I walked over to his house and requested an explanation for the seemingly stolen piles of mail that were visibly accumulating in his living room. I explicitly asked if he had been stealing my mail (my endless stream of gardening catalogues, exotic pet magazines, obscure culinary subscriptions, and countless other bizarre spam mails that I had strangely stopped receiving).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBob\u2019s response was a simply denial, followed by him making numerous accusations towards me! He wouldn\u2019t even open his door, presumably hiding his paper fortress out of a deeply held shame.\n\nUnsatisfied and finding Bob more suspicious than ever, I took my concerns to the neighbours, as well as voicing them at the village bridge night (the card game). I expected them to side with me over the blatant disregard for personal property and community safety.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOddly I was met with a cacophony of opinions, some suggestion I may have committed wrongdoing by stirring trouble over what they considered trivial matters and baselessly accusing Bob of theft (obviously it wasn\u2019t baseless).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome agreed with me that Bob is causing a fire hazard and chaotic living conditions.

He has (I think) the most extraordinarily large amount of paper\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: I neglected to mention a good point my ex girlfriend made - This Bob is an absolute nightmare on the bowling green!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 3: I really don't think you guys understand how much paper there is in his window - I can take a photo if this isn't against the rules (although I will have to check!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 4 (final edit I hope): I'm not sure I've communicated myself well, or maybe reddit isn't understanding.
