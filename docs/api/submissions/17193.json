He hangs out with my dad quiet often and some people have even asked me (F19) where my brother is, thinking the boy is my brother since he\u2019s always with my dad (we live in a fairly small town so everyone knows everyone). \n\nAnyway, this upsets me. My dad doesn\u2019t spend nearly as much time with me as he does with the boy, and he treats us differently. An example, is him buying food for him and not me. I know he takes him out to eat after school, so I\u2019ll occasionally ask if he can pick me something up. He always says \u201cmaybe\u201d or just a simple \u201cokay\u201d, but comes back with nothing but the excuse \u201cI didn\u2019t have enough money\u201d. Which is obviously a lie. \n\nSo one time during a long car ride, I felt the urge to tell him how I felt. So I did. I told him I wish he would treat me how he treats the boy and how I know things would be different if I was his son, not his daughter.

Maybe I\u2019m gaslighting myself into believing him that this is my fault he doesn\u2019t like me, either way I have no idea what to think. \n\nAITA? \n\nAlso, sorry if I worded any of this wrong or formatted it wrong or said too much.

As a parent my heart hurts for you, a child should never have to doubt the love of a parent, it's the parents job to make sure the kid knows.\n\nA good father will make you feel safe and loved, and that you are always good enough, just as you are.\n\nYou, me dear, do not have a good father. You do not even have a remotely adequate father.\n\nI know that must hurt you in many ways, but please listen to me: it is not your job to please him. You are your own person, and you are wonderful.

You confronted your father, told him what you need, and he is not willing/able to meet those needs.  Spend as much time as you can around people who are positive and like you for who you are.  You probably could benefit from counseling to repair the effects of your father being so mean.  Definitely don't blame yourself for your father being an ass-hole.  When I felt beaten down verbally by my parents, I'd look in my bathroom mirror and repeat, \"They're wrong.  They're wrong.\"  That and righteous burning anger got me through living with them with my self-worth in tact.", "NTA.  Sorry your dad sucks!", "I plan too once I move out. Part of me wants to keep talking to him in hopes he\u2019ll change, but deep down I know he won\u2019t. So cutting him out is the plan atm.", "Thank you for saying that last bit, it really means a lot to me. I started to cry a little while reading your response. I know it\u2019s not my job to please him, but sometimes I find myself craving his praise, so all I do is try to do things to please him so I can get that. I know I shouldn\u2019t, but it\u2019s hard. You seem very sweet, and I know you\u2019re a great parent.", "Trust me I would if I could. Ever since I was little I\u2019ve fantasized about telling everyone how mean he is, so people would stop being so nice to him when they see him. But since we all know each other, he would found out way too quickly that it was me and I don\u2019t even wanna imagine what would happen after that. Hopefully one day I\u2019ll have the courage to stop protecting him, probably when I move out.", "I know he won\u2019t change, I\u2019ve sort of accepted it over time. My mom is similar and I\u2019ve accepted her never changing, so the next step is fulling getting over him. Part of me has hope he\u2019ll change and I guess I sort of cling onto the idea. Gotta work on that.", "He isn\u2019t related to me in any way. He has parents, but neither of them are good parents. That might be one of the reasons? Since he doesn\u2019t have a good home life, maybe my dad feels like he\u2019s responsible for helping him out? I don\u2019t know honestly.", "Thank you, that\u2019s nice of you to say. I have a few close friends and a great partner that are all here for me. They keep me going when he makes me want to give up.", "He won't change. Only when he is old and sick and needs Something from you.", "Honestly, cutting my dad out of my life is part of what made him realize he needed to change. Boundaries are healthy.", "Honestly, cutting my dad out of my life is part of what made him realize he needed to change. Boundaries are healthy.", "Honestly, cutting my dad out of my life is part of what made him realize he needed to change. Boundaries are healthy.", "NTA. Nybdsd whas the same, BUT in my case with my brother. \nThey never change and always said its your fault, when never is. \nThey love blame others and make themselfes the v\u00edctims when someone ask. \nDont think to much about anything he said, because its no gona be true.", "Ofcourse you are. It's only natural for child to crave a parents love, no matter how old you get. I think that's a primal need that will never change. The hard part is realising  that need will never be fulfilled no matter what you try.\nJust remember you owe him nothing. You deserve to live your life and be happy", "It is really hard to handle that urge. I'm 37 and have been NC with my father for 10 years as of this summer. There's still a little part of me, buried deep, that feels that craving for parental love and approval. It never fully goes away, I don't think.\n\nThe best thing you can do for yourself is acknowledge that you did *deserve* your father's love and involvement and caring, even if you didn't get it. And the fact that you didn't is a reflection on *him* and his emotional maturity (or lack thereof), not due to any failing on your part.\n\n(Relatedly, if it helps at all, I suspect his outburst calling you a \"whiny bitch\" and blaming you for his neglect was him lashing out to cover his guilt at the truth of what you said.)\n\nI can't speak to it from a parent's perspective. But as someone who's been there myself, I can assure you that it's possible to find your own success in life and build the family you deserve on your own terms, away from the toxic bullshit you grew up with. It can be done - it took time, but I did it. And I have every faith you'll get there, too.", "If you can, get some therapy. Because we crave love from our parents but don't get it, we may try to unconsciously seek it from others. Unfortunately, the others usually end up being shit people too. We tend to recreate patterns. You may have a very demanding and abusive boss that you try to please to no avail. Something like that. It's weird, even though it's an abusive situation again, we still kinda seek it out. Because it's familiar, out of habit, or something we subconsciously crave. Awareness and therapy can help with that. You don't want to marry your \"father!\"\n\nI wish you the very best because you deserve it. Live your best life on your terms!", "People do have the power to change, but if they don't want to they won't.", "This! So much this. Guard yourself against it. \n\nSorry you got the shit dad. But you have to know you are enough, just as you are. That is separate from shit dad. Hold your head up and be proud of who you are. And if you don't know quite yet who you are, take the time to find out. If you have any aunts or older women you feel close to, spend more time with them. Cultivate a circle of family/friends that you feel good being with. You are enough.", "That or if she has children and one happens to be a boy", "NTA\n\nHe's a neglectful parent. He is a sexist. Find other men in your life who treat you better. Do you have an uncle or grandfather or cousin you can develop a relationship with?", "There's an awesome youtube channel called Dad, how do I? run by a guy who decided to become everyone's internet dad. Not the same thing I know, but he made it his mission to be there with some good advice for people who are - for one reason or an another - fatherless. It helped me, maybe it could help you too.\nAlso, NTA.", "Dear Jadelyn, I know you'ld rather hear this from your father, then from a stranger on the internet. But I am very proud of you! You had a rough journey and came out stronger on the other side.\n\nAnd what you said in your second paragraph is such important knowledge: it's not you, it's him", "Perfectly said. I went NC with my mother for 5 years when I was in my late 20s/early 30s, and it killed me because I knew how much it was hurting her even though she 100% deserved it. But I used that time to scrape her judgmental voice off the deep corners of my brain and my life is so much better as a result. I was able to stop caring about her approval because I could see her more fully as the deeply flawed human she is. And now when she compliments me (rare but more frequent than she used to) I can accept it with the appropriate grain(s) of salt instead of letting the dopamine take over and start the craving cycle all over again.\n\nI\u2019m proud of you Jadelyn, and I\u2019m proud of me. We did it and we\u2019re doing okay."]}
