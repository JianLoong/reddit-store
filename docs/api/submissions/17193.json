You confronted your father, told him what you need, and he is not willing/able to meet those needs.  Spend as much time as you can around people who are positive and like you for who you are.  You probably could benefit from counseling to repair the effects of your father being so mean.  Definitely don't blame yourself for your father being an ass-hole.

I know it\u2019s not my job to please him, but sometimes I find myself craving his praise, so all I do is try to do things to please him so I can get that. I know I shouldn\u2019t, but it\u2019s hard. You seem very sweet, and I know you\u2019re a great parent.", "Trust me I would if I could. Ever since I was little I\u2019ve fantasized about telling everyone how mean he is, so people would stop being so nice to him when they see him. But since we all know each other, he would found out way too quickly that it was me and I don\u2019t even wanna imagine what would happen after that. Hopefully one day I\u2019ll have the courage to stop protecting him, probably when I move out.", "I know he won\u2019t change, I\u2019ve sort of accepted it over time.

It's only natural for child to crave a parents love, no matter how old you get. I think that's a primal need that will never change. The hard part is realising  that need will never be fulfilled no matter what you try.\nJust remember you owe him nothing. You deserve to live your life and be happy", "It is really hard to handle that urge. I'm 37 and have been NC with my father for 10 years as of this summer. There's still a little part of me, buried deep, that feels that craving for parental love and approval. It never fully goes away, I don't think.\n\nThe best thing you can do for yourself is acknowledge that you did *deserve* your father's love and involvement and caring, even if you didn't get it. And the fact that you didn't is a reflection on *him* and his emotional maturity (or lack thereof), not due to any failing on your part.\n\n(Relatedly, if it helps at all, I suspect his outburst calling you a \"whiny bitch\" and blaming you for his neglect was him lashing out to cover his guilt at the truth of what you said.)\n\nI can't speak to it from a parent's perspective. But as someone who's been there myself, I can assure you that it's possible to find your own success in life and build the family you deserve on your own terms, away from the toxic bullshit you grew up with. It can be done - it took time, but I did it. And I have every faith you'll get there, too.", "If you can, get some therapy. Because we crave love from our parents but don't get it, we may try to unconsciously seek it from others. Unfortunately, the others usually end up being shit people too. We tend to recreate patterns. You may have a very demanding and abusive boss that you try to please to no avail. Something like that. It's weird, even though it's an abusive situation again, we still kinda seek it out. Because it's familiar, out of habit, or something we subconsciously crave. Awareness and therapy can help with that.

I went NC with my mother for 5 years when I was in my late 20s/early 30s, and it killed me because I knew how much it was hurting her even though she 100% deserved it. But I used that time to scrape her judgmental voice off the deep corners of my brain and my life is so much better as a result. I was able to stop caring about her approval because I could see her more fully as the deeply flawed human she is. And now when she compliments me (rare but more frequent than she used to) I can accept it with the appropriate grain(s) of salt instead of letting the dopamine take over and start the craving cycle all over again.\n\nI\u2019m proud of you Jadelyn, and I\u2019m proud of me. We did it and we\u2019re doing okay.", "NTA. \n\nAt some point in my adult life I realized that my parents were not capable of being any better parents than they already were, and clinging to hope that they could be better was keeping me stuck in an anger cycle.  \n\nParents are just human beings with flaws.
