But now I'm getting tired of having to give up my time. The two year mark just passed. Not only are lots of people giving up their time off but we have to do his work on top of ours.

If your coworker is still unable to return to work after two years, he should apply for disability benefits rather than asking people to keep donating vacation time.", "It's been two years??  WTF, no NTA.  That's really weird.  If people want to donate their time so this guy never has to work again that's fine I guess, but they shouldn't be treating you badly if you don't want to give up your leave.", "NTA. This is an appalling practice. You should never have to give up your (limited) leave to someone else. What if you also experience a bereavement soon??\n\nYour union should be fighting for discretionary leave clauses or protected job status for those on unpaid leave.", "NTA. Speaking from an employer point of view the fact that this was allowed to go on for 2 years is insanity.", "NTA. Two years, he needs to decide if he needs to take a medical/stress leave or come back to work.", "NTA. He needs a lot of help if he\u2019s so grief ridden after two years he can\u2019t return to work. The answer is absolutely not to continue to donate your leave to him. Firstly, it is your leave. You deserve a break. Secondly, you all are enabling him. He\u2019s never going to take steps to improve things whilst he\u2019s getting a free ride\n\nEdit to add - go to HR about this situation. Any one who is making you feel bad about your decision is a bully. I\u2019m amazed HR has allowed this to happen for so long", "NTA - this guy is just taking advantage of everyone at this point and getting paid for nothing. Besides all that, whether you share your PTO or not should only be between you and HR, it's none of anyone else's business. I would not share another single HOUR.", "NTA.  2 years is just milking the system.  It long past time for him to come back or resign.", "How is noone else feeling like this also. It was very gracious of you all to do for doing so initially, but 2 years?\n\nNTA", "It\u2019s a scam at this point.", "NTA you have done what you feel you can do. That is enough", "NTA - at 2 years he is taking everyone for a ride.  Only a mug would give him anymore of their leave.", "NTA. At this point no one should be donating. A year would be generous. Two is ridiculous.", "I. Cannot. Two years?! Everyone in my office would be right there with you. Nta.", "Two years?! This guy is just abusing his co-workers. He needs to be sent for disability evaluation because is absent for more than 3 months.\n\nNTA, of course, your colleagues, who think you are heartless, just enable him.", "NTA. That is just bs taking 2 years bereavement leave especially out of coworkers pockets.", "Two Years?!? NTA", "NTA Two years is ridiculous. I am sorry for his loss but that is insane. I\u2019ve never heard of something like this before. You should be able to use your time like you want to. Your coworkers must not have lives outside of work to still be donating their time to him. Don\u2019t feel bad at all and if they continue to treat you that way then f them.", "Two years?!? NTA.", "NTA, you need time off as well.  If he cannot come back to work after two years, he either needs to get some major counseling or have a major investigation done.  What is he doing?  Is he really grieving or is he out living the good life.  Better yet has he found another job and is double dipping.", "NTA and the widow is a loser who\u2019s taking advantage of the system and everyone\u2019s (stupid) generosity.  It\u2019s been two years.  Move on or quit your job.", "NTA. If you can't go back to work after 2 years, you need some help. I could see people donating for a couple of months to get everything squared away and such, but this is excessive.\n\nUse your time for yourself and don't feel bad about it. This person needs to get help and go on appropriate leave or honestly lose their job (since they aren't actually working).", "NTA this has gone on for far too long.", "NTA, you shouldn't be obligated to give up your time. It's a bit harsh to say it's been long enough. Everyone grieves differently. That said there is a line between supporting and enabling.

How many people are donating how much time to give this guy a two year vacation?", "NTA.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine the grief and heartbreak your coworker feels. That being said, asking people to donate their vacation time for *two years* is beyond excessive. If he is so deep in his grief that it\u2019s impacting his ability to function in everyday life *including* showing up for work, he needs to look into short or long term disability options and seek out a mental health professional.\n\nIt is incredibly unfair to you and your other coworkers that, not only are you being pressured to donate your vacation time to a coworker for fear of being alienated if you say no, but you\u2019re also having to function while perpetually being down an employee. It\u2019s also unfair of your coworker to continue to take advantage of you & your employer by putting them in a position where he can\u2019t be terminated or replaced. \n\nLike I said, and like you said, it\u2019s been two years. At this point your coworker is being paid to not do his job at the expense of you and all your other coworkers. That\u2019s not right.", "Definitely NTA in this situation. He wants to take time off then he can file for disability or ask his family to support him.", "Def NTA. 2 yrs. 2 years?? Like all the others have said, everyone grieves in their own way and time, but this isnt even on HIS time, its on everyone elses time. He needs to learn to be productive again, and like others have said, he is now just taking full advantage of everyones generosity. He needs to find something else to better suit him, go back to work and learn to function again, or file for some kind of disability. His bills arent anyone elses problems to get paid. If others want to continue aiding in his behavior, thats on them. At some point, everyone needs to take responsibilty for their own lives and issues. At this point, does he even know how to do his job anymore? \n\nYou should really seek out some advice from HR if people are trying to bully you over this. You DESERVE your own time off and to be able to bank your own time for anything that may come up in your life. Good luck!", "NTA\n\nI'm sure the loss was hard on him and it was great everyone pitched in and donated some time, but you all are being taken advantage of now.\n\nHell, if I could get people to continuously donate 40 hrs a week to me I'd never come back until it's time to retire.", "\u2026..two years?  You\u2019re telling me he\u2019s been off for TWO YEARS????  \n\nMy husband died very unexpectedly and suddenly four years ago. After three and a half weeks, I went back to work. I fully understand that there\u2019s no one right way to grieve, and that there\u2019s no timeline for processing that grief. However, I just needed out of the house. The mundanity of daily tasks, of being around people, of not staring at the walls and wallowing in that loss helped, immensely. No, you\u2019re not the asshole. If he\u2019s truly still this immersed in his grief, he doesn\u2019t need more time off, he needs some intense therapy. Ignoring the world isn\u2019t going to bring anyone back, it\u2019s only going to compound the loss and cause it to fester. I\u2019m sorry for his loss, I truly am.

Our bereavement is 3 days.", "Grief has no end date and this person is not TA for needing two years to get over the loss of both is wife and his child.\n\nHowever, NTA for not wanting to donate any more. You need to take care of yourself, too, and vacation helps your mental health. Why does he not have any access to paid leave? Does he not have the option to go on FMLA? His grief making it impossible for him to work could be classified as a mental health leave. \n\nOur society sucks when it comes to taking care of people. Everybody should have access to paid leave when they lose someone or are ill.", "NTA it's two fucken years they aren't coming back.", "Nta this 100 percent!

It would do him well to get back to work and find purpose.
