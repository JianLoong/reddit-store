That being said, asking people to donate their vacation time for *two years* is beyond excessive. If he is so deep in his grief that it\u2019s impacting his ability to function in everyday life *including* showing up for work, he needs to look into short or long term disability options and seek out a mental health professional.\n\nIt is incredibly unfair to you and your other coworkers that, not only are you being pressured to donate your vacation time to a coworker for fear of being alienated if you say no, but you\u2019re also having to function while perpetually being down an employee. It\u2019s also unfair of your coworker to continue to take advantage of you & your employer by putting them in a position where he can\u2019t be terminated or replaced. \n\nLike I said, and like you said, it\u2019s been two years. At this point your coworker is being paid to not do his job at the expense of you and all your other coworkers. That\u2019s not right.", "Definitely NTA in this situation.

Like all the others have said, everyone grieves in their own way and time, but this isnt even on HIS time, its on everyone elses time. He needs to learn to be productive again, and like others have said, he is now just taking full advantage of everyones generosity. He needs to find something else to better suit him, go back to work and learn to function again, or file for some kind of disability. His bills arent anyone elses problems to get paid. If others want to continue aiding in his behavior, thats on them. At some point, everyone needs to take responsibilty for their own lives and issues. At this point, does he even know how to do his job anymore? \n\nYou should really seek out some advice from HR if people are trying to bully you over this.

Good luck!", "NTA\n\nI'm sure the loss was hard on him and it was great everyone pitched in and donated some time, but you all are being taken advantage of now.\n\nHell, if I could get people to continuously donate 40 hrs a week to me I'd never come back until it's time to retire.", "\u2026..two years?  You\u2019re telling me he\u2019s been off for TWO YEARS????  \n\nMy husband died very unexpectedly and suddenly four years ago. After three and a half weeks, I went back to work. I fully understand that there\u2019s no one right way to grieve, and that there\u2019s no timeline for processing that grief. However, I just needed out of the house. The mundanity of daily tasks, of being around people, of not staring at the walls and wallowing in that loss helped, immensely. No, you\u2019re not the asshole. If he\u2019s truly still this immersed in his grief, he doesn\u2019t need more time off, he needs some intense therapy.

Two years is long enough plus year to year he gets his own leave so this just screams taking advantage of people to get extra time off.  I would at least consider it if he was caring for a kid but by then he should have things worked out anyways.

How long is he expecting to keep up this arrangement? \n\nAlso, the work should (or maybe does) have counselling services.
