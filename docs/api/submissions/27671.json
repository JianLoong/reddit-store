Prior to this year, my team had been very respectable and would always take turns talking. Earlier this year, half our team was moved into other parts of the company and we got a new supervisor who started hiring a bunch of new employees. Almost instantly we noticed a lack of meeting etiquette with the new hires with them speaking over people presenting or even taking control away from someone presenting to share their screen. We sent out regular memos reminding the team of proper meeting norms and we even asked our higher ups to assign a hr lesson package to our team to explain how to act during a meeting.\n\nToday, we had a very important meeting as our deadlines were being pushed excessively. I was leading the morning meeting to try to get a feel of what had to be completed but some of my team members kept interrupting one of our developers who was trying to present. I asked to please let our coworker finish but they started to take control of the conversation. Soon all the new hires were talking over each other. They were over explaining things which caused more confusion. It got to the point where it just muted the offending coworkers and would only unmute them if we addressed them.\n\nAfter the meeting, my supervisor told me that was a very rude thing to do. Apparently, the coworkers I had muted started messaging my supervisor telling him I was censoring them. Am I the asshole?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I also wanted to point out that the meeting was only allocated for 30 minutes and we had 12 different developers who had to present. Normally, the developers take 2 minutes max to give a small update. The incident happened during the 3rd developer's turn to present and had caused a 10 minute delay. My team members have very tight schedules with many of them having important meetings right after this one.\n\nEDIT2: I'm getting a lot of confusion regarding the nature of the morning meeting. Having a morning meeting where all the developers briefly say what they're working on is standard in the corporate world. The purpose is to say what you're working on and to briefly mention any issues or blockers you may be facing. This isn't meant to be a major discussion or a \"town hall\" and if conversations start to drag longer we do ask them take the conversation off meeting. 30 minutes is a standard amount of time for these meetings as everyone is suppose to only give brief updates.\n\nEDIT3: To everyone who also works in the corporate world, this is a standup meeting.", "created_utc": 1695740894, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16sqk0i/aita_by_muting_my_coworkers_during_a_meeting/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He should have the opportunity to finish his presentation before discussing or explaining anything.", "NTA. It's your task to keep the meeting on track and productive. You tried to coach them and they didn't respond correctly. You handed the situation fairly. They were disrespectful.", "NTA, they need to learn how to act in a zoom meeting. It\u2019s ridiculous that you need to hold their hand through learning simple meeting etiquette.", "NTA. Going forward I would start every important meeting with everyone muted and be clear that they should save any questions they have to be discussed at the end of the meeting.", "NTA.  You were leading a meeting and as a part of that you have to make sure your meeting stays on track.  \n\nNext time you lead a meeting, set ground rules to remind your co-workers that it is not productive to talk over each other.  If they continue then ask them to please raise the hand button to be called.  If that doesn't work then feel free to do the mute thing.  That way you show that you are trying to work with your coworkers and have to use escalating tactics to get things moving.", "NTA - speaking as someone who leads meetings :)\n\nI would preface each meeting with a blanket statement that everyone will be muted except for the presenter until the Q&A portion. They can type questions into the chat (of there is one) or just note their questions and ask at the end, where you can go around the room and each person has 1 minute to get questions out.\n\nI might also suggest extending the meeting to 1 hour if you can - strive to get it done in 30, but remove the absolute dire stress of finishing in 30.", "\"Censoring\" is a hilarious claim, idk what kind of business you're in, usually I'd defer to the supervisor but you say you were leading this meeting, people were taking it off the rails and work wasn't getting done...NTA for *leading* the group to better focus", "I muted people who were typing, moving shit around and yes, if you couldn\u2019t run an effective meeting not a bad idea.", "NTA if you can\u2019t wait your turn like an adult, be prepared to be treated like a child", "If you've counseled them repeatedly, you gave them plenty of heads up on the issue. That mute others function is there for exactly this reason. They may be mad about it but they needed to be muted.\n\nI suggest having a long talk with your supervisor and dumping the issue in his lap. Ask him how he would solve the problem. Press him for a concrete practical alternative. If he can't give one, tell him that meetings will either end up being useless or take so long that there's absolutely no chance of meeting the deadline. Which does he prefer?\n\nThe only other solution I see is to explicitly state that everyone but the speaker will be muted for the duration of their talk. And that questions or comments will only be entertained after all speakers are done. That way people have a heads up and can take notes on what they want to address during Q&A.\n\nOn a side note, it sounds like this company is really, really dysfunctional. perhaps it's time to start looking before they start failing.", "Nta. That would never fly where I work. Everyone mutes themselves. We type any questions in a chat and they are addressed after presentations. If they consider you muting them rude, do they realize how EXTREMELY rude they were? \n\nGood for you for muting them. I would have too!", "NTA. Start recording the meetings. That way when they say you were rude, you have proof that they don\u2019t know how to stay their lane.", "Either the people who are interrupting have a bad case of \"I am the main character\" or they feel insecure about their job and they think that if they don't speak during the meeting that their boss will think they are not paying attention or not contributing like they should.", "NTA the new hires need to learn their place. They definitely need that lesson on meeting etiquette.", "Mmmmm....NTA, because the real assholes here are the new hires and the supervisor.  You were slightly out of line muting them, even though it needed done.  That's the kind of thing a supervisor or senior person should do, not a peer, and ideally it should be the person running the meeting. The new hires are assholes because who talks over a presenter or tries to take over their presentation? And who thinks being muted in a meeting is censorship?  Assholes.  And the supervisor sucks for calling you out on it instead of managing the problem children, that being their fucking job.", "Of course your NTA.

Sometimes you just have to let things hit the fan. Let the meeting run it's course. Keep reminding them to let others speak and when you do speak to be clear and concise and not over explain. Be considerate of other's time and you all won't accomplish anything by talking at the same time. Maybe you can do it wear the person can only talk if they are called upon, like a classroom. Maybe consider limiting the meetings to only the people necessary. If you need to call someone in, then do so. You probably have an idea of who is interrupting who and should address accordingly.", "YTA Muting your coworkers during a meeting is not just rude; it's a blatant power move. You claim to want proper meeting etiquette, but your actions reek of arrogance and disrespect. Instead of trying to find a more constructive solution or addressing the issue with empathy, you chose to silence your colleagues, creating more tension and hostility. You need to seriously reconsider your approach and learn how to work together with your team instead of acting like a dictator.", "YTA. That would be the equivalent of covering your ears with your hands (or gagging them I guess) in an in-person meeting, so no you can't do that at work. Especially when you're the \"leader.\"\n\nYou might have done better to instead announce at the beginning of the meeting, \"Everyone will be muted unless they are the designated speaker. Raise your hand in the chat if you have a question.\"", "ESH. It's not really appropriate to mute colleagues on a call, even with best intentions it does come across as a bit passive aggressive. Your colleagues also aren't in the right either because talking over others is rude no matter the setting. \n\nHave you as a team put in any time to discuss team dynamics / ways of working? Team dynamics seem to have shifted with the new joiners entering the scene. The newbies and the existing team need to flex and adapt figuring out what works best together as one unit vs. defending the status quo.", "NTA\n\nI expect to not be interrupted when meeting in person, and would tell people to not interrupt.   Muting is preferable because it removes the need for public confrontation.", "NTA \n\nYour act was less rude than theirs", "NTA in any way, shape, or form. I will mute someone so fast (provided it\u2019s my meeting obvi)- talking over people consistently, chewing loudly, having side conversations with other people in the room with them. Nope.

I\u2019m tempted to ask more questions because I believe this may also be a cultural issue.", "NTA! It\u2019s honestly what was needed if no one else can act professionally and respectfully.

Your manager is atrocious. I'm on calls w 750 people. The only one talking is the presenter. Our questions are put in the chat and another manager reads them out.loud or they're answered in teams", "NTA It is entirely reasonable to say that the developers are here to present and the others to listen so everyone's will be mixed except for the person presenting. Questions and comments will be handled by email after the meeting.", "NTA what's rude is them disrupting the meeting to talk amongst themselves and over each other. You ASKED your supervisor for help, and you were ignored. This is on your supervisor.", "NTA - the new hires are being incredibly rude, they can put their questions in chat to be addressed at a later date.  This is an update meeting - not a town hall, WTH", "That type of behavior probably isn't appropriate in a debate either.", "I feel like there could be some missing context here.  I\u2019m very curious what the supervisor thinks.  If he\u2019s siding with the new hires over this guy, maybe the new hires were brought in because this guys structure and process is not working well, and nobody wants a half hour meeting dedicated to OP \u201cgetting a feel for what needs to be completed.\u201d  Maybe this has been repeatedly explained to OP.  I\u2019ve been in that rerun, and OP is the heel for sure in that version of events. \n\nIt\u2019s the unavoidable problem of this sub, but many situations can just be so slanted when we only hear one side.

Which means the goal is to get it done as quickly as possible - the standard used to be that they were held literally standing up! Standup isn't the time for any questions or comments. At most you're supposed to give a \"can I follow up on that offline\" and then let the next person talk.\n\nWe normally get ours done in under a minute a person! But we do daily standups, not weekly.

They had been asked to let developers finish their presentations without interuptions during the same meeting.\n\nThis is not kindergarden where you have to educate kids about proper manners over and over again.", "It is literally in OP's post - meetings etiquette was pointed out several times prior, there was seminar held for this specific topic and OP asked during the meeting to remain civil and ask questions after presentations. \n\nWhat is inappropriate is to keep interrupting and disrespecting your colleagues and seniors.\n\nOP is NTA.", "I dunno, new hires who genuinely don\u2019t have anything useful to contribute shouldn\u2019t be interrupting the meeting", "Not sure why you would think that. OP clearly states in the edit that there are 12 presenters, who are given 2 minutes to speak. That is 24 minutes of a 30 minute scheduled time slot. It isn't OP who is presenting, or if they are, they are allocated 2 minutes. The new hires constantly interrupt and talk over the presenters to the point that have asked HR to intervene on meeting etiquette. Pretty sure that is not an OP thing. NTA.", "Just to clarify, all the teams have a morning meeting to go over what we're working on and if we've ran into any issues. Its standard across the corporate world. I'm not in charge of the team but I am in charge of the morning meeting. The new hires were hired to replace people who had moved else where in the company. Normally, the supervisor doesn't attend the morning meeting as their role is to manage people and not the project.", "There is nothing good about interrupting presenters in a 30 minute standup for project updates. That's not a management style being made, it's either poor hiring or poor management.\n\nIf there's questions/things to talk about, book a follow-up meeting with the appropriate people or deal with it via email/group chat.", "Yes this is a standup, I didn't use the term as I wasn't sure people would know it. Most teams have their standup only for 15 minutes but we changed ours to 30 minutes to ensure everyone had enough time", "If it\u2019s not kindergarten, people shouldn\u2019t be muting others.  You can ask someone to follow the meeting etiquette;  you don\u2019t get to enforce this when you are just the asshole who is running the meeting.  Op is not the supervisor, and any good supervisor would have known better than to mute people in the middle of a meeting."]}
