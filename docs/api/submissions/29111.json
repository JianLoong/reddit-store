John Milton's character in Paradise Lost isn't just some evil devil with horns and a pitchfork. He fits more with the namesake of \"adversary' and TST uses him as a symbol against tyranny and arbitrary authority. To me, this symbolism connects with their political viewpoints and activism. That we aren't just causing a ruckus, but calling out injustice from those in positions of power. I also feel that there is some shock value there, but I believe it's a bit of a necessity on two fronts: the first being that those pushing their religion in these positions of power would claim from a legal standpoint that we have no footing if we were just under a heading like \"American Atheist Society \" or something similar. They would argue we could not understand their deep-rooted faith with nothing similar of our own. My second point would concern garnering media coverage for our legal battles and attempts at keeping those church and state boundaries. If we had a name like \"Nontheistic Religion\", or whichever example you would like, no one would really pay it much attention. It would easily fade into the background, and most news sights might not even bother to cover it.
