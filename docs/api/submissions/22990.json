So I could see it being E S H for folks voting before that clarification. Cooking dinner is a big chore but until the edit I thought really not a chore worth ALL other ones. Of course all the *dishes* and cooking related cleaning is a better balance to cooking dinner and easier than cooking usually (depends on what is cooked vs how messy).
