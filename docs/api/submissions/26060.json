I'd need a bit more context about the specific surgery to say for certain, but recovery time for surgery doesn't normally mean your completely useless and need 2 people to help out at all points of every day. Most people are walking by day 2 anyway. Recovery time just means take it easy, certain things are off limits, you'll need some medication, and you might be in pain.

Being right doesn't make the consequences of your actions turn out ok for you. \n\nMaybe try to talk to her first, because it seems like she wants support, also being a caregiver in insanely exhaustive. She can take care of her father on her own, right. But having someone to support you at home while you do this, is also a lot of help. People don't know shit about it until they are on a caregiver position.
