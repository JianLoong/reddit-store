How often do you do that?", "I read it as 1.5 weeks meaning 10 days. Am I wrong? 4 weeks after surgery he leaves but for 10 days, not 5 weeks?", "I love being single.", "NTA.\n\nMy husband and I too go on trips seperately if our annual leave doesn\u2019t match up. I see no issue with it. As you said, you\u2019ve picked a location she wouldn\u2019t want to go anyway, so chances are you were always going to go there alone. She\u2019s welcome to go somewhere you dont want to go another time.\n\nFurthermore, nobody can expect EVERYONE to put their lives on hold because someones going to be sat at home, in bed, high as a kite on pain killers following surgery.  The FIL will no doubt be absolutely fine and all you\u2019ll be missing is your wifes family visiting and making meals for him. If, for some tragic reason, it doesnt go so well, you\u2019ll know well before the trip and cancel if necessary. \n\nI really don\u2019t see the issue here.

Without knowing the details of the surgery, I can\u2019t elaborate, but I assume it does not mean he\u2019ll be laid-up in bed for 3 months. The 1 week after surgery to help out does sound like a reasonable after-surgery recovery time. \n\nIf you live a few hours away, and don\u2019t plan on staying with them for more than a week and did discuss this prior, she may just be overly stressed out right now. I know my spouse and I do vacation separately from time to time due to different likes and with guy/girl trips so that doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable. 4 weeks after FIL surgery, when he lives hours away from you also doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable. Sit down with your wife and have a clear discussion about why this bothers her. \n\nSo many of these posts would disappear if people just communicated \ud83d\ude44", "YTA... Who books a long vacation without talking to their partner?", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure what surgery he is having but does he really need two people a month out? I\u2019ve had multiple surgeries that had a long recovery (shoulder, knee, abdomen) and I only needed a lot of help for the first week or so. There were things I continued to need assistance with, but it was things like operating a can opener one handed, tying shoes one handed. There has to be another reason she is upset and she is using her father as an excuse", "NTA As I understand it you have a rare chance with a few weeks off. You're prepared to cancel if any complications and have given your wife plenty of notice. You don't have to sit around 'just in case'. I would be waving my husband off cheerfully. (Again if you were a woman in this situation Reddit would be cheering you on and telling you your husband will be fine looking after your MIL)", "YTA. Not for the trip itself, but that you went and booked it in the first place without as so much discussing it with your wife first. Wtf.", "YTA unless you left out a lot of really important details.\n\nIf your wife intends to help her father throughout his recovery, you are choosing to leave for 5 weeks during that recovery window. This is a stressful time for your wife and her family. Even if she doesn't expect you to offer more support beyond that first week, your wife deserves your support back home.\n\nDid you speak with her about this in advance? How often do the two of you go on 5 week (Oops, 1.5 week) long international vacations? How often do you get this type of time off?\n\nThere is a huge chance that she would love to get away from the stress of her fathers surgery for a reasonable amount of time. Did you tell her you wanted to do some traveling with this time off to see what she could do?\n\nI feel a bit of guilt going on a fun weekend getaway when my wife can't come. I would need a hell of a lot of reassurance that she was okay with me leaving for 5 weeks while she was stuck at home. I couldn't even consider it if I knew something stressful was happening in her life.\n\nWhere are your priorities?", "NTA \nEnjoy your trip", "INFO\n\nWhat kind of surgery is your FIL getting?", "Nta", "You adked your partner and she had no.opi ion so you booked.

Who *does* that?", "NTA Go and enjoy yourself.  It sounds like you need a vacation from your wife, so this all works out nicely.", "INFO how much PTO do you get a year? \n\nDid you really just use all/most of your vacation days on a trip without your wife, booked without her knowledge, during which time she will be caring for her unwell father?", "YTA - incredibly stressful and uncertain time and your off cavorting overseas. Husband of the year seems out of your reach.  Certainly not being available for your wife in a time of need.  I'd expect it to be chilly upon your return", "You are in a family lifetime vs personal needs cross road. Which path brings greater long term happiness?", "If you booked the trip without talking to your wife then you are TA but it sounds like you discussed it with her and she was fine with it then changed her mind in which case NTA. \n\nHonestly my guess is she mentioned it to someone and they freaked out which made her second guess.
