OP doesn\u2019t want a person she barely knows to attend her wedding. It\u2019s that simple. The wedding is about OP and her fianc\u00e9, not her brother. I realize that people can fall in love quickly. My parents did and so did my fianc\u00e9 and I. The relationship between OP\u2019s brother and his gf is different from the relationship between the gf and OP\u2019s family. I didn\u2019t expect my in-laws to treat me like family right in the first few months. I knew it would take time. \n\nFor example my fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother and his wife had a baby last year and they had a special cultural ceremony to celebrate the birth. Like OP\u2019s wedding, only immediate family was invited to this celebration. I was not invited, but I wasn\u2019t offended and neither was my fianc\u00e9. We weren\u2019t engaged yet and the family was still getting to know me. These things take time and you can\u2019t force yourself into people\u2019s lives because you fell in love.", "No, OP doesn\u2019t have any regard for her brother\u2019s girlfriend, because she doesn\u2019t know her. And with the wedding being next month, that\u2019s hardly a lot of time to make acquaintance. And really, OP shouldn\u2019t have to worry about making these kinds of accommodations. She did not want to worry about any person beyond who was essential to her, which it sounds like is exactly why she made her rule. This day is about who OP considers essential to her life, not who her brother considers essential to his life. \n\nBut anyway, there seems to be a financial concern too. Perhaps if her brother was willing to shift the cost of accommodating his girlfriend, there can be some compromise.", "\"She\u2019s clear it\u2019s siblings and parents only.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt will be parents, NOT sibling.", "It's not just a person the OP barely knows. It's her brother's girlfriend, and he wanted her to be there. She could always get to know her, and recognize her brother's preference, but that might get in the way of some really arbitrary rule somebody made up or something that lets her insult both her brother and his girlfriend for her special day.", "The brother is not forcing anything. He is just not coming to OP's wedding, because she disrespects his relationship. A reasonable reaction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is OP's problem - and not the brother's - because SHE is unhappy that her brother won't be there for her wedding.", "Oh so if he wants to have his girlfriend there he could pay? That seems icky.\n\nAs long as the OP no longer claims to be close to that brother, and is happy to have alienated him and his girlfriend, it's her accomplishment, and it may be impossible to undo the damage. Doesn't seem particularly celebratory.", "Her fianc\u00e9s brother is also a sibling no?", "Who cares what he wants? It\u2019s not about him. OP only wants to be surrounded by people she\u2019s the closest to. That\u2019s not an unreasonable request. When he gets married, he can have the wedding he wants.", "That is forcing it. He\u2019s trying to push OP into a corner so she has no choice but to give in.", "Indeed, she is unhappy that her own actions have prevented her brother from being there.", "The reverse doesn\u2019t sound better to me: because OP\u2019s brother\u2019s girlfriend wants to come uninvited, OP should pay? \n\nI feel a girlfriend who wants to make their boyfriend\u2019s sister\u2019s wedding about them maybe deserves a bit of alienation, because that\u2019s being entitled. \n\nIf OP\u2019s brother really wants to do something meaningful together with his sister and his girlfriend, some kind of vacation later could also be on the table. I don\u2019t see why OP\u2019s brother should take such a stand, especially at such wedding which only consists of like six people. There should be other, better places to get introduced to the full extent of the family.", "So: it will be HER parents, but NOT HER sibling.", "She sure isn't very close to that brother, as she made a point of pushing him away.", "NO\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"He\u2019s trying to push OP into a corner\" there is no croner, and no pusing. He simply has told her he won't come to her wedding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"so she has no choice but to give in.\" It likely is to late for that- Even if OP changes her mind, the insult is already done. So: It is unlikely that would change anything - even if she agrees to him bringing the gf, he likely will stay with the \"no, thanks - I am not coming\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo: No corner pusing, that decission is already made. OP has to live with it, and likely can not change it any more.", "I think if you want your brother there he should be allowed to bring a guest be  it a relative or his girlfriend. Gezzuz guy. WTF?", "NTA \n\nIt sucks for your brother, I can understand him wanting to bring his girlfriend since +1\u2019s are generally allowed to things like this, but this is your wedding not his. \n\nI\u2019ve been on the other side of this scenario in which my best friend didn\u2019t invite me to her wedding because she had never intended on actually having a ceremony and just wanted immediate family as well. To be honest, I was a little hurt when I found out another friend of hers was invited while I wasn\u2019t, but I sucked it up and tried to be understanding. \n\nIn all honesty, your brother and gf should do the same. Ideally, both of them would act like adults and respect your wishes with the gf reassuring your brother that it\u2019s okay if she doesn\u2019t go since he seems so worked up about it.", "NAH. You can invite who you want to your wedding. Your brother has the right to refuse to attend your wedding if his gf is not invited. The question you need to ask is are you prepared to deal with the consequences of him not attending the wedding.", "NTA. Sounds like your brother needs to do some growing up.", "Your wedding your choice , tell him to suck it up or dont come, NTA", "How did your brother\u2019s boss get an opinion? Most bosses aren\u2019t involved in employee\u2019s personal lives and definitely not in their family matters. Ignore the boss. Explain to your brother - again - that it is nothing against his girlfriend. However, it is up to him to not come to your wedding. You will miss him and hope he doesn\u2019t regret it later. But be firm and do not give in to bully tactics. And tell his boss to butt out. You don\u2019t work for him and he has no authority over you. And have a beautiful wedding with no tears. This is a happy time. Don\u2019t let your henpecked brother ruin it.", "2 sets of parents and 2 brothers is a pretty intimate group for a wedding.\n\nI can see it now. If Bro got to bring GF. They break up. She's forever in wedding pictures.\n\nI will admit I went to my SO's sister's wedding about 3 months into our relationship. But by month 1 his family had adopted me into their group. We had weekly family dinners and saw each other almost everyday. I was shocked to be invited but they really wanted me to attend.", "You can't vote twice. Jesus Christ, you're really invested in this.", "He is 20.", "My best friend had a pretty small wedding, her BIL brought his gf and she's in a load of wedding pictures. Then they broke up and now she has a rando in all of her otherwise intimate wedding pictures. 4 months is def not looking enough for this situation", "Except for his own sister's wedding.\n\nOP is NTA. I get so sick of this sense of entitlement towards plus ones that I see on this sub. If he can't disentangle himself from his girlfriend for a couple of hours, then he's the problem.", "What\u2019s wrong wrong with you?", "Its 6 guests, so no plus ones", "Don\u2019t listen to these people. You\u2019re NTA. \n\n4 months doesn\u2019t make a boyfriend or girlfriend family. Not to mention, it\u2019s YOUR wedding. YOU get to determine who\u2019s there. And that is neither selfish nor being an asshole. Enjoy your special day \u2764\ufe0f", "Piggybacking off this, my mom married my stepdad and my sister and I brought our boyfriends and we both had only been dating the guys for a month prior. Mom now has wedding pictures with randos in there", "OP didn't dismiss the brother. She curated HER guestlist to HER wedding and her brother threw a childish fit instead of being mature and realizing a quick tiny ceremony without the girlfriend wouldn't be a horrible thing. \n\nI didn't intrude in my husband's life when we were dating, and he was the same. Brother is immature af.", "You are missing that she said NOBODY is getting a plus one. It\u2019s only parents and siblings. Not to mention the brother has only been with the GF for 4 months! It would be different if she had been with the family for 4 years. \n\nBack off the OP.", "Bro. \n\nIt is OP's wedding. It is filled with people important TO OP.\n\nA girl who has dated his brother FOUR MONTHS isn't yet important to OP. \n\nIt never said the girlfriend was even upset about it, but brother's BOSS commented?? Brother is immature as hell and OP is NTA.", "Are you secretly the brother or something??", "They\u2019ve only been dating 4 months, you seem to think they are living together. \n\nHe would tell gf well in advance and she\u2019d plan something else for that night. And schedule the next date for another night. \n\nDoubt they\u2019d see each after the wedding, like you said. That likely would only be if the did live together, which they wouldn\u2019t be this early on in a relationship.", "I can't tell if it's hilarious or deeply pathetic and concerning at this point xD", "> He can suck it up\n\nin what way is this supposed to dissuade me from my view that his night will suck? yes, he can indeed suck it up. but sucking it up is different than having a night that doesn't suck. sucking it up is what you do *when your night sucks.* If your night doesn't suck, there's nothing to suck up. See how that works? I fully agree with you, and also it changes nothing about my stance.", "And neither you nor the brother get to determine who\u2019s allowed at HER wedding. \n\nWhen him and the girlfriend break up he\u2019s going to regret missing his sister\u2019s wedding for picking the stupidest \u201chill to die on\u201d.  Four months at 20 years old doesn\u2019t scream longevity.", "Or the girlfriend who is desperate to go", "The wedding guests are important to OP. Girlfriend isn't. Simple as.", "You just want to be angry so badly, don't you?", "Brother is the one napalming. This isn\u2019t his wedding and he\u2019s entitled thinking he can get past the rules.", "What? I have never considered someone I dated for 4 months family. You sound like you jump into relationships too quickly and get into unhealthy situations.", "Oh and that was the end of the world, right?\n\nOf course, if someone told you that you didn't have the sense to have a lasting relationship with your significant other, you'd be fine with that.\n\nIt seems the brother understands that the OP intended to insult him. Seems less celebratory to reject family's loved ones than to accept them.", "u/redditactron\n\nWhere did you get years? Op literally wrote 4 months. MONTHS. Not years", "Did your wedding also only have six guests?", "Her brother feels that his girlfriend is worthy. The OP doesn't see her brother's feelings or his girlfriend as worthy. Seems sad to base nuptials on exclusion.", "Both tbh. So many weird posts.", "You can\u2019t go anywhere without a fuck buddy?", "It's only been four months! I didn't really get a chance to get to know any of my siblings' significant others in that amount of time, especially once we were adults.", "There's no evidence that the girlfriend of the brother wanted to make the event \"about them\", only that the brother wanted his girlfriend there. Is there some weird wedding tradition to affront relatives with judgmental hostility?", "Because he\u2019s choosing not to go. OP didn\u2019t disinvite him."]}
