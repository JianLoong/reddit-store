Seems like you are the gf.", "The OP hasn't considered the feelings, has in fact rejected the feelings, of a brother with whom also supposedly \"close\".  I'm not seeing how any form of celebratory/symbolic/sacred/whatever event would require exclusions which likely alienate a sibling.", "Are you with the relationship duration and quality police?\n\nDo you routinely tell other people that their relationships aren't serious?\n\nHow would you be qualified to do that?", "If the situation were one brother who was not dating at all, it's not the same for the nondating brother to get the plus one. If one brother is serious about a woman, why go out of one's way to insult him and her?", "The relevance pertains to the incongruence between\n\n\"people that matter to us most\"\n\nand\n\n\"he was over joyed about the ceremony until he said that he would be would be bring his gf (20M). I had told him no due to my fianc\u00e9 and I wishes\"\n\nwhich indicate that the brother does not in fact matter, and moreover the fact that the brother \"freaked out\" over OP's edict should not have surprised OP, if in fact her brother mattered to her much at all.", "She's not. She's just having a tiny wedding with immediate family only. Gf is not family. I don't know what you don't get about this.", "No-one actually talks like that, but congratulations on sounding like an anachronism from the 18th century.\n\nThere is no incongruence, though. It's OP and her fianc\u00e9's wedding, so it's the people who matter to OP and her fiance. Not people who matter to OP's brother.\n\nShe doesn't know her brother's gf well, so shocker, the gf doesn't matter to her much. But even if she did know her well, it's irrelevant, because they decided to invite immediate family only. Brother and gf aren't married and haven't been together long. No one is going to classify gf as immediate family in those circumstances.\n\nNot inviting her brother's recent, short term gf does not in any way indicate that she doesn't care about her brother. Rather, brother's irrational over the top reaction to finding out his short term gf wasn't invited gives an appearance that OP's brother may be somewhat suffering from main character syndrome, or being self-centred. Or, if you wish a term that fits your 18th century vernacular, I would suggest egocentrism.", "If the brother and his girlfriend see themselves as family, why insult them?\n\nWould it make the marriage better that OP causes suffering for someone claimed to \"matter most\" for the wedding ceremony? How?"]}
