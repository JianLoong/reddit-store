My parents think I'm a huge asshole for this, and I need some outsider input.\n\nI (24F) am in grad school. My brother is 20 and in undergrad.\n\nA year ago, I received unsolicited text messages from a TA who taught one of my classes. To this day, no one knows how the guy got my number.\n\nI received the very first text message whilst in a car with my brother and our mother. That very first message wasn't explicit, but I immediately got a bad feeling, because the entire thing was obviously very inappropriate and some strange man had acquired my phone number from who-knows-where.\n\nAs it happened whilst I was literally sitting next to my mother and brother, I immediately told them about this weird thing that just occured. My mother was immediately concerned.\n\nMy brother, however, basically went into a rant about how I shouldn't be overly sensitive, women these days think everything is harassment, there might be a perfectly innocent explanation behind all of it, etc etc. You can imagine how it went.\n\nI was under a lot of outside stress at the time in addition to this thing and basically started crying in the car. It ended with my mother having to drop me off at my home.\n\nThe TA who texted me excalated to sending me very explicit photos in the two hours that followed. I reported him, and eventually got him fired and charges filed against him. The entire process was hugely challenging and stressful. My university fought me tooth and nail, law enforcement authorities were deeply unhelpful, but I got it done.\n\nThroughout that entire process, my brother never once apologised. It changed our relationship irrevocably. We've become significantly less close, and we weren't that close to begin with due to our age difference.\n\nMy 25th birthday is coming up and I'm throwing a huge party. I haven't invited my brother.\n\nOur parents recently asked me why I hadn't invited him. I told them honestly that his reaction, and lack of an apology, to the entire ordeal I faced last year has changed my relationship to him and I didn't necessarily want him there.\n\nMy parents pointed out that my brother was barely 19 at the time and didn't know better. Additionally, according to them, he spent his whole life living in the shadow of 'strong women' (being academically outperformed by me, socially outperformed by his same-age female cousins, and recently having had his first breakup) and was probably just looking to 'reclaim some power'. Whilst I think the latter argument is BS, it is true that he was very, very young at the time and people do stupid things as teens.\n\nI'm not sure whether I'm the asshole here. I can see that he was (is) young, but I was 19, once, too, and I certainly didn't react like that to stories of s\\*xual harrassment told to me by close friends and relatives.\n\nAITA?\n\nAnd excuse the censoring, I think some words trigger the automod for 'violence'.", "created_utc": 1682631478, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13183vd/aita_for_not_forgiving_my_brother_for_his/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In my case it was when my brother went on a tirade about how mental health wasn't a real thing when I brought up to my family that I may need some help.

Good for his ex for dumping him, you should invite her instead.", "50/50 split on who's the A. \n1. His reaction to the very first text, which you said was not explicit or anything, just slightly weird, is pretty understandable, especially for a 19 year old guy. You mentioned how you would know better at 19 - well, as a guy, I will certainly be the first to say girls mature faster than boys, that includes during college years. \n2. When the situation escalated, your brother should have not only apologized, but (and I'll probably get crap for this), he also should have sought out this TA and put the fear of God in him, if not outright cracked him...but that's just how I would have handled it with my sister who is 3 years younger than I am...but you said you were never particularly close. \n\nIn my opinion? Call him, tell him about the party, explain why you were hesitant to invite him, and hopefully now he's matured enough to offer an apology. Life's too short to let something like this impact a relationship with a family member.

As an older sibling you could have taken this as an opportunity to talk to your brother more about his reaction, show him the pics the TA sent you, ask him if he would like someone doing that to his future daughter\u2026 but instead you shut him out so that the only people he communicates with are possibly the incel circles he is in, which will make his views worse.", "NTA.

During the ordeal itself, I was honestly too exhausted to deal with my brother, but after the case had wrapped up, it hit me full force how fucked his reaction was. I talked to my mother about it and mentioned how surprised and disappointed I was. She claims to have spoken to him after that conversation, and claims that he 'felt awkward' about what he did, but he never apologised, never mentioned it to me, and never sought any sort of healing with me.", "Oh boy.\n\nDuring the ordeal itself, the topic obviously came up at the occasional family dinner. I don't live at home, but there was a time where I basically had weekly meetings with all sorts of people from my university, law enforcement, etc who wanted me to give a statement or five. I've simplified the process hugely for the character limit, but long story short: I wasn't the only girl that TA harassed. Over 20 victims came forward eventually, at least three of which had had actual 'real-life' encounters during which they were harassed/groped by the guy. Us victims had to band together to get the university to act. There was a LOT of work involved in getting this man fired.\n\nThroughout that entire time, my brother would basically clamp up and look around shiftily whenever I mentioned something related to the topic around my family. I was honestly so stressed at the time that I didn't fully care how fucked his reaction had been. It was only after we FINALLY got the guy fired and charged that it hit me full force. At that point, I sought out my mother to ask her whether he'd mentioned anything about how he felt to her, and expressed my disappointment to her. She promised to talk to him.\n\nAccording to her, he expressed that he felt 'awkward' about his reaction to my situation. She says she thinks he felt 'bad', though he didn't say that explicitly. He's never come forward to apologise to me or mention it in any way. If the topic of what happened comes up (it eventually became a fairly well-known story in my wider social/family circle, and people occasionally ask for details in front of him) he clamps up.\n\nI haven't sought confrontation with him. I'm not sure whether I should.", "It indeed took a long time. I've simplified hugely for the sake of the character limit here, but the entire process was an odyssey. I wasn't tne only woman the TA harassed- over 20 victims came forward eventually, including at least three who'd become victims of physical sexual harassment/groping/intimidation by him. We had to band together to get the university to act, we discovered a fatal flaw in the university's system for anonymising exams that allowed him to access student's contact info to find new victims, and so on and so on. This was a long, painful process. \n\nThroughout the entire ordeal, he basically would only clamp up and look around shiftily whenever the topic came up around him. I do believe he feels bad. However, he never once sought any sort of conversation with me, and honestly, I'm so fucking exhausted. Some of the victims were YOUNGER than him. By far. I feel so betrayed and, frankly, *annoyed* and *angry* that some 18-year-old girls are 'old enough' to stand up against being victimised, whilst my twenty-year-old brother can't be arsed to apologise to me.", "Really, dude?  This is not on her at all. He is an ADULT!", "But he never apologized. You build character when you fuck up, own it, apologize and make efforts to do better. Pretending it didn\u2019t happen serves no one.", "OP, 100% NTA.  \nWas it ever revealed how the TA got your number?  \nMy sister had a stalker, she changed her number a few times, but he always got it.

He's pathetic!", "I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through this and I admire you and the others who came forward \u2014 took a lot of courage.", "What specifically is not on her? Yes it is true her brothers view of women isnt her responsibility to hold.  But as a sister, as a family member, possibly as a friend, it is her responsibility to provide outlets where these views can be discussed and challenged.  Shutting the brother out closes the dialogue, and then the only people that will engage with him are similar minded people.  As a family member, it is your responsibility to be patient with his shortcomings because he has the ability to change as a person.", "Jesus Christ. Hugs to your sister. That sounds SO bad. I'm so sorry for her and hope she can heal.\n\nIt was never properly revealed how he got my number in particular. However, we know that he got the contact info for some other victims due to faults in the system our university used for anonymising exams/tests during covid. I never took a test in his class, but I did take multiple ones for a class taught by a colleague of his. There wasn't ever proof, but the working theory is that he probably got my number through that colleague, though no one knows whether the colleague willingly supplied him with my details or whether he just waited for an opportunity to rifle through his computer.", "Thankfully it was over a decade ago, she's happily married now.  \nMaybe one day your brother will be able to figure himself out, but IMO, he needs to take the 1st step."]}
