Then she has an option. \n\nMy holidays are a bit like that--everyone actually brings all the dogs to the home of whoever is hosting. I don't have a dog, and it's not really my thing to have dogs around like that--but they're all part of the package. I'd rather be with my family than not. \n\nI DO really feel for SSMIL though; holidays after losing a spouse or SO are tough, and the first ones can be especially awful. In all honesty though, if she declines to be at your house, is that uncomfortable, or ultimately isn't invited.

They can invite his brother and his partner too, plus you two as well if they wish. It's really on them to be honest.
