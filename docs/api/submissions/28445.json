It\u2019s not any more fair to judge phobias than allergies. Phobias are classified as mental illness and anxiety disorders.

But if I\u2019m ever in a situation where I need to decide whether to inconvenience the pooch or a human being, the human must come first. SSMIL is a new widow, going through a difficult time, and is probably quite lonely. It\u2019s better to be empathic and proactive about including her in things instead of knowingly alienating her from the family she has left for the sake of dogs. It may be disappointing to do things like leave your dogs at home for park parties but she has communicated her phobia to you several times and you have chosen to dismiss it as dramatic. Your dogs will be ok in a quiet room for a few hours during thanksgiving.

After a couple of years, she started keeping them inside when I visited, but very close to her. The dogs also weren\u2019t allowed on furniture, so I wasn\u2019t jumped on while we were talking. By the time she moved states, I was comfortable enough with her dogs that I could pet them and didn\u2019t mind when they cuddled up to me. I still don\u2019t like strange dogs - if I know the owner and see they have good control, I can deal with them, but I\u2019m still anxious. I\u2019d be curious to know if the mil would be willing to do some exposure therapy and make progress. It\u2019s not quick, but this is something that really impacts her life, clearly.

Ditto for all the future holiday get-togethers.  You don't have to invite anyone into your home who is likely to complain, cause trouble and make people feel uncomfortable.  Simply tell your stepson and his wife that her attitude and behaviour at the park makes it clear that the dogs are not the problem, she is.
