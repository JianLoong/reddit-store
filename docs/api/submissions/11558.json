If she has the energy to storm out, she has the energy to clean up after herself.  Does she use pads or any kind of anything, or just free bleeds all over?   If she's bleeding through pads enough to ruin furniture, she needs hospital.  If she's free bleeding, not using anything to absorb it, she can clean up after herself. That's unsanitary to have blood covering everything.", "NTA. Your gf is gross. Tampon, pad, AND period undies. Very easy. Her unwillingness to take care of her own bodily functions is alarming.", "NTA.\n\nFeels like she's taking advantage of her situation and your kindness to not clean up after herself.\n\nI don't even know how she can just make you clean it. I'd be somewhat ashamed of myself. I always check 3 times to make sure I didn't leave a mess anywhere.", "NTA. I also had a situation similar to your gf. Went to the doctor and needed minor surgery. I understand how painful and embarrassing the situation is for her.\n\nThat being said, I NEVER asked or expected anyone to clean up the mess from my period troubles.

I used to have my \u201cbleeding towel\u201d and I would put it under me wherever I was sitting or sleeping. It was so easy and prevented many messes. The fact that it seems this has become a bit of a pattern (you cleaning up her period messes), is definitely not good! She needs to figure this out for herself and I say that as someone who has been in similar shoes. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that you have so much else going! Support goes both ways and it sounds like she needs to support you a little/a lot more and learn to accept and live with her complicated periods.", "NTA waking up and having bled on the bed... getting up after a movie to see a spot on the sofa... it happens... but if it's all over the house - why didn't she see and use some protection?

And if her periods are that heavy, she's likely dealing with anemia as well.", "NTA, there is absolutely no reason you should be cleaning up her period more than once.

Did you tell her about your problems? Did she used to clean up after herself before you moved in together? \n\nShe needs to see a doctor. Sounds like something is medically wrong. \n\nIf it turns out that it's not, then she needs to see a mental health professional. \n\nI have known a few people that weren't trained on how to clean up themselves, prevent issues, etc. with menstruation cycles. They all came from really bad home situations. A quick talk with an adult female fixed the knowledge gap.", "NTA \n\nHeavy gushing periods totally suck. Your girlfriend should learn how to prevent messes though. Wearing a diaper or putting a towel down would help.", "If it was that bad, I hope she is reaching out to her doctor.

I used tampons, pads, towels.  Anything I needed to in order to prevent the need to clean up huge messes on furniture.\n\nSounds like she either needs to see a doctor, as that amount of bleeding is abnormal, or she's free-bleeding and needs to be more considerate of people she lives with (you).", "NTA \nI understand bleeding thru your pad when you\u2019re sleeping, sitting for a couple of hours!

You probably shouldn't tell her this, but she needs to get some adult diapers seriously. They are great with really heavy flow.\n\nNTA.

Maid service, not so much.", "NTA I don\u2019t even understand how she lets this happen and act like she had no control. They make so many underwear now designed for periods. If I\u2019m late I wear a pad just so there are no surprises. As far as I\u2019m concerned the fact that you have been cleaning up her blood makes you a freaking saint. You had a hard day so you needed some empathy too. Relationships can\u2019t be one sided. She really needs to get this figured out with her doctor.", "NTA - that\u2019s disgusting. That\u2019s like having bowel problems and asking your partner to clean up your waste.

I have abnormal periods too because of pcos. Sometimes the flow is so much the pads cant hold it n i stain clothes n bedding n matresz n cant even leave the house. But i always cleanup myself no mater the pain. I cant even think of asking someone else to clean up for me especially if they had a long day. I guess its ok for her if she was in really unbearable pain, but op also had the right to not do it", "NTA, this is absurd. I\u2019ll refrain from giving medical advice but she needs to find a way to at least keep herself from bleeding all over your home. Get some absorbent pads for the bed, couch, whatever.", "NAH at the moment, on the info provided.\n\nI used to have difficult periods because of pain - I would literally collapse onto the floor from standing and have to lie still, unable to get back up until it passed. Period pain can be fucking awful and genuinely debilitating, and I would expect a partner to help me out then, just as I would if e.g. I couldn\u2019t get up and do something because of an injury. It\u2019s not necessarily just \u2018discomfort\u2019 - it can be *agony*. Hormonal imbalance suggests to me it might be something like PCOS / endometriosis, both of which can be incredibly painful, and the latter often results in needing surgery to remove tissue. \n\nI understand that you didn\u2019t want to clean up given the circumstances, and that you usually do, and you got the blanket and pain meds for her, which is why I\u2019m going NAH. If she is in debilitating pain (and honestly, I\u2019m taking what you say with a pinch of salt bc as someone who has had heavy, painful periods in the past, I know that it\u2019s very difficult for people who haven\u2019t experienced that level of pain to understand it), then she\u2019s not an AH for wanting your help to clean up. You will be an AH if you refuse to help her in future just because. It\u2019s blood - if she hit her head and bled everywhere, would you refuse? It\u2019s no more gross because it\u2019s come from her vagina instead of another orifice. \n\nThat said, what she\u2019s experiencing isn\u2019t normal. If she isn\u2019t seeing a specialist about her periods, she should be. If she is physically capable of cleaning up and she isn\u2019t, or she isn\u2019t taking reasonable steps to avoid bleeding everywhere (I.E. as soon as she realises she\u2019s bleeding going to the bathroom and using adequate sanitary products) then she\u2019s an AH, because if this situation can be avoided then it should be - that\u2019s not to say it can be, she might have the world\u2019s worst periods and be taking every step she can and it still happens, we can\u2019t judge that.", "NTA. She can storm out, but not take ten minutes to tidy up after herself.", "NTA you're her partner, not her maid.\nI do think you should encourage her to see a doctor for the imbalance and heavy bleeding though, menorrhagia can cause issues like anaemia and it may benefit her to look into long term birth control if the periods are that uncomfortable.", "Cleaning up her biohazard mess is a generous bonus on your part, it should not be seen as core BF duties. I hesitate to call an ill person an ah, but here we are. NTA.", "Ewwwwwwww", "I think if my partner was in a lot of discomfort and bled everywhere, I\u2019d certainly help him. And having had endometriosis, I can tell you that what you call \u201cdiscomfort\u201d is very likely extreme pain. People who love each other help each other when they\u2019re in pain. Sometimes you put helping your partner over your own selfishness.", "If you can storm out of a room because you are angry, you can tidy up after yourself. NTA", "Info : Does she not wear period underwear?", "NTA. I understand the crazy period. I had one once where I was bleeding through anything and everything. I ended up in the ER to make sure I wasn\u2019t hemorrhaging. I had bled through a tampon, pad and my clothes in the car so I went to the bathroom to try and clean up. I did have my husband come with me because I was afraid of passing out. It took both of us twenty minutes to get me and then the bathroom back clean. That being said I would never assume my husband should clean up after me and  once I knew it was just going to be a crazy few days of bleeding I broke out the depends (they hold much more liquid than a traditional pad). If girl is having a crazy flow then it\u2019s time to do crazy preventative work (wear depends or period panties, sit on a towel whatever it takes but there isn\u2019t any reason her body fluid should be all over the general living space)", "NTA,  I would never expect or ask my SO to clean up my menstrual blood. My mess my job to clean up. I also don't bleed over everything I don't understand how that happens.", "She sounds gross and disgusting.

Something isn't right with her.", "NTA\nI used to have periods from hell. Like literally three times the normal amount of an entire period within 30 minutes. Not once have I spread it all over the house. Have I stained things without noticing? Sure, small stains, not just leaving it everywhere.", "NTA!

There's no excuse for just ruining furniture and god knows what else.", "It's kind of you to clean up after her, she's not entitled to it and shouldn't expect that from you. Plus I'm kinda concerned that this seems to happen on a regular basis. Sure, that can happen, but when that happens so often, she needs to do something about it. And she should definitely see a doctor about it. NTA", "NTA. Your GF needs to seek Medical Attention, preferably from a specialist. Her medical conditions are HER responsibility and she needs to make better accommodations ( extra long sanitary napkins, leak proof underwear, soil proof blanket etc) for herself to prevent future mishaps. Your not her caretaker and she needs to recognize this.", "NTA.  I get highly irregular and heavy periods and I have bled through pads and couldn't use tampons due to being prone to UTIs (might be the same thing for her) but I have never asked anyone to clean up the messes I'd leave if an accident or leak happened.  My issue ended with a hysterectomy and my husband and myself were very grateful that the hormonal mess had been taken care of.  You shouldn't have poked the bear though with your snap back about the apology.  That's a discussion for after the worst is over.  She should get an IUD implanted though to help stop her misery however if she has tried birth control pills and they didn't work.", "NTA. I get it. I have PCOS. When I don't have hormonal birth control, I bleed like I'm dying & have cramps & migraines so painful I have both thrown up and passed out. I've never been and never will be regular without the aid of an IUD (currently have the implant & am a week late myself). But I can usually tell a day or so before it starts based purely on cramping & if not, when I do get it, I usually feel it come. \n\nI've never heard or experienced a flow so heavy that you bleed on multiple surfaces without having felt it start. If my period comes on fast, I might get a small spot where I was sitting and the same if I bleed through a pad, but no one's ever described those accidents as \"it was everywhere\" and unless I was actively vomiting or unconscious, it's never been beyond me to spray a little upholstery cleaner & dab it up. \n\nHonestly, I'm a tad suspicious of your girlfriend here, but even assuming she's being 100% honest, it's on her to learn better management of her body. Not on you to clean up a battlefield everytime she free-bleeds everywhere.", "If she's literally getting it all over the house like that she needs to either go to a hospital or at least a gyno immediately because that amount of bleeding isn't normal", "NTA - you were empathetic by getting out the blanket and meds.

I don't think that after having such a bad day ONCE, not wanting to clean it it's selfish. \nHe said that his father is sick, did she leave her own selfishness for him? Did she help him to have a little weight off him just this time?", "Just because his pain was not physical doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not suffering too", "But she also needs to be an adult and figure out how to not get blood everywhere. I completely understand if this was a one off, but it happens frequently. It\u2019s a tough situation, but it\u2019s not his responsibility to clean up after her every single time when she for some reason can\u2019t figure out how to prevent this.", "Heck I'm wondering how she manages to (on several occasions) not only bleed through her tampon/pad (presumably both if she's that heavy), her underwear, and her clothes to the sofa/floor/etc. I've always thought my first day was on the heavy side, but dang...", "She does.", "I understand a leak but not everywhere. How does that happen? Bedding is the most common for me (if I was to leak but not often).\n\nNTA", "I have endo too, and while I sometimes bleed through my pads in the night and thus had light spotting on the sheets, I cleaned up after myself. I got incapacitated by the pain nearly every month, and had to take 3grams (yes grams not miligrams) of ibuprofen just to be able to function, move or even work.\n\n\nStill it is her resposibility to clean up after herself.", "And to add on to that: I *would never* ask my partner to clean that up. Unless I was in such bad shape I physically couldn\u2019t. Obviously I can\u2019t hold other people to my standards, but that\u2019s just gross", "This is my thought as well. That wasn't a late period, that was an early miscarriage.", "If she can manage to get it everywhere and storm out she has the strength to lay down a towel before settling", "All over the bathroom floor, thankfully not our bed\n\nAlso, thank you .", "Depends..", "He said this has happened on multiple occasions and that her period is irregular. In either case, she needs to see a Dr.", "Yes, seconding this, assuming OP isn\u2019t (unintentionally) exaggerating quantities.", "if you could only hear the cackle i just had reading this \ud83d\udc80", "Sounds like she needs to find a better doctor.", "I know you said you weren't looking for medical advice, but the irregularity and heaviness of her periods is clearly affecting her life, it's time to go to a specialist. This doesn't have to be normal. \n\nI suffered similarly for far too long as well. It took two gynos after I'd been through 2 GP's to get to someone who listened to me and told me something other than 'have a baby, that'll fix your periods' or 'it's probably not as bas as you're describing'. For me the Mirena IUD changed my life, lighter periods that barely hurt without all the side effects. Pills were not good for my mental health (tried so, so many different formulations) as were other systemic hormonal birth controls. I stopped missing work monthly and life in general, I could go on trips without intense period anxiety, I didn't have to plan everything around an unreliable cycle, I was like a whole different person. \n\nI do have hygiene supply and cleaning recommendations if you're interested, or more accurately her, and I do think she needs to clean up after herself. I'm just saying this problem seems like it's much bigger than a few stains and who cleans them, she might need some support to pursue treatment. After years of doctors saying no, it's really hard to keep pushing even if you know something is wrong.", "Wait wait wait, is anyone else concerned about OP saying his gf occasionally takes birth control? That seems like that itself could be absolutely wrecking her hormones.", "Washable puppy pads under the sheets, dark sheets so they don\u2019t stain as much, ultra tampons or a cup combined with overnight pads or diapers, period underwear is a good back up if you are super irregular. It still doesn\u2019t get everywhere though because it\u2019s contained to whatever spot you are in and you learn the clean up routine to the point you don\u2019t have to think about it much at all.", "Of course she needs to see a doctor but she can\u2019t do that immediately. Who are you to say she\u2019s not in incredible pain if she can move?  I had severe endo and managed to get into an ER from my workplace. Decent humans help each other in times of pain instead of shaming each other about a bit of boood like it\u2019s the 1950s.\n\nI had a haematoma during pregnancy which mean suddenly every week or so I\u2019d have a gush of blood that turned my jeans red. I\u2019m glad my husband helped me because it\u2019s the only thing that got me through.", "Okay. At this point, she needs to go to the doctor. Has she ever thought about maybe using a menstrual cup?", "Same. While I'm sleeping, even then I wash the bedding, I never ask my husband to clean it up.", "I had the same thought.", "I never said otherwise. In fact I said she can clean up whenever she feels ok.", "WTF was she doing?\nDoes she not use any period products?\nHow does she manage to leave the house?", "Yes, I know. It sounded like this one was worse, which is what made me think it. \n\n>She\u2019d been complaining her period was late, by like a little over a month.\n\n>I got home yesterday and it was like everywhere I can\u2019t even explain how bad it was, I don\u2019t know how she managed it, she said it was heavier because it was late.\n\nA doctor is definitely necessary at this time.", "There\u2019s clearly no shaming if OP has cleaned it up many times before. So who are you to indirectly call OP selfish for not doing it this once? Helping someone is great, being taken for granted and unappreciated is not.", "She\u2019s unable to use anything like a tampon/insertion, I don\u2019t know why but she says she physically can\u2019t use one", "I can't either, but there are other options if period underwear isn't working. She's got to figure it out.", "I couldn\u2019t use tampons or menstrual cups because they would fill up immediately and my body would expel them. I finally had an endometrial ablation done so I don\u2019t get periods anymore, but I\u2019m also in my late 40s and had two children so for me it was a no-brainer, but for your GF there are obviously other things to consider. Hormonal birth control also didn\u2019t work for me, so I get her struggles in trying to manage it. Something she could try is incontinence underwear (more absorbent than period underpants) and keep a puppy training pad under her when she sits and sleeps. It sucks but it will help minimize the cleanup. My vote is NAH because no one is really one based on the info you provided.", "Is there an issue affording enough sanitary supplies? Sounds like she should be using pads with period underwear and visiting the restroom frequently. Another though is mental health issues. Poor hygiene can be a sign of depression. You\u2019re NTA but like u/lilirose13 said, she needs to figure something out."]}
