If she has the energy to storm out, she has the energy to clean up after herself.  Does she use pads or any kind of anything, or just free bleeds all over?   If she's bleeding through pads enough to ruin furniture, she needs hospital.  If she's free bleeding, not using anything to absorb it, she can clean up after herself. That's unsanitary to have blood covering everything.", "NTA. Your gf is gross. Tampon, pad, AND period undies. Very easy. Her unwillingness to take care of her own bodily functions is alarming.", "NTA.\n\nFeels like she's taking advantage of her situation and your kindness to not clean up after herself.\n\nI don't even know how she can just make you clean it. I'd be somewhat ashamed of myself. I always check 3 times to make sure I didn't leave a mess anywhere.", "NTA. I also had a situation similar to your gf. Went to the doctor and needed minor surgery. I understand how painful and embarrassing the situation is for her.\n\nThat being said, I NEVER asked or expected anyone to clean up the mess from my period troubles.

I used to have my \u201cbleeding towel\u201d and I would put it under me wherever I was sitting or sleeping. It was so easy and prevented many messes. The fact that it seems this has become a bit of a pattern (you cleaning up her period messes), is definitely not good! She needs to figure this out for herself and I say that as someone who has been in similar shoes. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that you have so much else going!

Did you tell her about your problems? Did she used to clean up after herself before you moved in together? \n\nShe needs to see a doctor. Sounds like something is medically wrong. \n\nIf it turns out that it's not, then she needs to see a mental health professional. \n\nI have known a few people that weren't trained on how to clean up themselves, prevent issues, etc. with menstruation cycles. They all came from really bad home situations. A quick talk with an adult female fixed the knowledge gap.", "NTA \n\nHeavy gushing periods totally suck.

I used tampons, pads, towels.

You probably shouldn't tell her this, but she needs to get some adult diapers seriously. They are great with really heavy flow.\n\nNTA.

Maid service, not so much.", "NTA I don\u2019t even understand how she lets this happen and act like she had no control. They make so many underwear now designed for periods. If I\u2019m late I wear a pad just so there are no surprises. As far as I\u2019m concerned the fact that you have been cleaning up her blood makes you a freaking saint. You had a hard day so you needed some empathy too. Relationships can\u2019t be one sided. She really needs to get this figured out with her doctor.", "NTA - that\u2019s disgusting.

I guess its ok for her if she was in really unbearable pain, but op also had the right to not do it", "NTA, this is absurd. I\u2019ll refrain from giving medical advice but she needs to find a way to at least keep herself from bleeding all over your home. Get some absorbent pads for the bed, couch, whatever.", "NAH at the moment, on the info provided.\n\nI used to have difficult periods because of pain - I would literally collapse onto the floor from standing and have to lie still, unable to get back up until it passed. Period pain can be fucking awful and genuinely debilitating, and I would expect a partner to help me out then, just as I would if e.g. I couldn\u2019t get up and do something because of an injury. It\u2019s not necessarily just \u2018discomfort\u2019 - it can be *agony*. Hormonal imbalance suggests to me it might be something like PCOS / endometriosis, both of which can be incredibly painful, and the latter often results in needing surgery to remove tissue. \n\nI understand that you didn\u2019t want to clean up given the circumstances, and that you usually do, and you got the blanket and pain meds for her, which is why I\u2019m going NAH. If she is in debilitating pain (and honestly, I\u2019m taking what you say with a pinch of salt bc as someone who has had heavy, painful periods in the past, I know that it\u2019s very difficult for people who haven\u2019t experienced that level of pain to understand it), then she\u2019s not an AH for wanting your help to clean up. You will be an AH if you refuse to help her in future just because. It\u2019s blood - if she hit her head and bled everywhere, would you refuse? It\u2019s no more gross because it\u2019s come from her vagina instead of another orifice. \n\nThat said, what she\u2019s experiencing isn\u2019t normal. If she isn\u2019t seeing a specialist about her periods, she should be. If she is physically capable of cleaning up and she isn\u2019t, or she isn\u2019t taking reasonable steps to avoid bleeding everywhere (I.E. as soon as she realises she\u2019s bleeding going to the bathroom and using adequate sanitary products) then she\u2019s an AH, because if this situation can be avoided then it should be - that\u2019s not to say it can be, she might have the world\u2019s worst periods and be taking every step she can and it still happens, we can\u2019t judge that.", "NTA. She can storm out, but not take ten minutes to tidy up after herself.", "NTA you're her partner, not her maid.\nI do think you should encourage her to see a doctor for the imbalance and heavy bleeding though, menorrhagia can cause issues like anaemia and it may benefit her to look into long term birth control if the periods are that uncomfortable.", "Cleaning up her biohazard mess is a generous bonus on your part, it should not be seen as core BF duties. I hesitate to call an ill person an ah, but here we are. NTA.", "Ewwwwwwww", "I think if my partner was in a lot of discomfort and bled everywhere, I\u2019d certainly help him. And having had endometriosis, I can tell you that what you call \u201cdiscomfort\u201d is very likely extreme pain. People who love each other help each other when they\u2019re in pain. Sometimes you put helping your partner over your own selfishness.", "If you can storm out of a room because you are angry, you can tidy up after yourself. NTA", "Info : Does she not wear period underwear?", "NTA. I understand the crazy period. I had one once where I was bleeding through anything and everything. I ended up in the ER to make sure I wasn\u2019t hemorrhaging. I had bled through a tampon, pad and my clothes in the car so I went to the bathroom to try and clean up. I did have my husband come with me because I was afraid of passing out. It took both of us twenty minutes to get me and then the bathroom back clean. That being said I would never assume my husband should clean up after me and  once I knew it was just going to be a crazy few days of bleeding I broke out the depends (they hold much more liquid than a traditional pad). If girl is having a crazy flow then it\u2019s time to do crazy preventative work (wear depends or period panties, sit on a towel whatever it takes but there isn\u2019t any reason her body fluid should be all over the general living space)", "NTA,  I would never expect or ask my SO to clean up my menstrual blood. My mess my job to clean up. I also don't bleed over everything I don't understand how that happens.", "She sounds gross and disgusting.

Something isn't right with her.", "NTA\nI used to have periods from hell. Like literally three times the normal amount of an entire period within 30 minutes. Not once have I spread it all over the house. Have I stained things without noticing? Sure, small stains, not just leaving it everywhere.", "NTA!

I have never been this disgusting. \n\nShe\u2019s choosing to do this.", "NTA, and I'd be concerned about her mental health because there is no reason for an \"accident\" to happen in more than one spot.

There's no excuse for just ruining furniture and god knows what else.", "It's kind of you to clean up after her, she's not entitled to it and shouldn't expect that from you.

And she should definitely see a doctor about it. NTA", "NTA. Your GF needs to seek Medical Attention, preferably from a specialist. Her medical conditions are HER responsibility and she needs to make better accommodations ( extra long sanitary napkins, leak proof underwear, soil proof blanket etc) for herself to prevent future mishaps. Your not her caretaker and she needs to recognize this.", "NTA.  I get highly irregular and heavy periods and I have bled through pads and couldn't use tampons due to being prone to UTIs (might be the same thing for her) but I have never asked anyone to clean up the messes I'd leave if an accident or leak happened.  My issue ended with a hysterectomy and my husband and myself were very grateful that the hormonal mess had been taken care of.  You shouldn't have poked the bear though with your snap back about the apology.  That's a discussion for after the worst is over.  She should get an IUD implanted though to help stop her misery however if she has tried birth control pills and they didn't work.", "NTA. I get it. I have PCOS. When I don't have hormonal birth control, I bleed like I'm dying & have cramps & migraines so painful I have both thrown up and passed out. I've never been and never will be regular without the aid of an IUD (currently have the implant & am a week late myself). But I can usually tell a day or so before it starts based purely on cramping & if not, when I do get it, I usually feel it come. \n\nI've never heard or experienced a flow so heavy that you bleed on multiple surfaces without having felt it start. If my period comes on fast, I might get a small spot where I was sitting and the same if I bleed through a pad, but no one's ever described those accidents as \"it was everywhere\" and unless I was actively vomiting or unconscious, it's never been beyond me to spray a little upholstery cleaner & dab it up. \n\nHonestly, I'm a tad suspicious of your girlfriend here, but even assuming she's being 100% honest, it's on her to learn better management of her body. Not on you to clean up a battlefield everytime she free-bleeds everywhere.", "If she's literally getting it all over the house like that she needs to either go to a hospital or at least a gyno immediately because that amount of bleeding isn't normal", "NTA - you were empathetic by getting out the blanket and meds.

For me the Mirena IUD changed my life, lighter periods that barely hurt without all the side effects. Pills were not good for my mental health (tried so, so many different formulations) as were other systemic hormonal birth controls.

If this is a regular thing for her, there really isn't any reason that she can't prepare and get a few old towels or an old blanket to put down underneath her on bad days.\n\nThe way her periods are is not normal. If her obgyn or gp isn't helping her, she needs to find a new one. There are ways to help this. I used to have heavy flows with cramps so bad I would pass out.

You do end up in the bathroom way more often if you choose to do something like this, but as I see it, free bleeding doesn\u2019t have to mean you are getting blood everywhere.

In fact, all studies on women's periods up til one done at the turn of the century (~2000) were done exclusively on men.
