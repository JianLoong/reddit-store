There were only 7 adults and two children. (important note: in our country, the electricity is switched off for 4-6 hours twice a day.)\n\nThe antibiotics I was taking for a UTI was making me feel very unwell the day before and during the party. However, I tried to participate in the festivities. Eventually, at around 9pm, I decided to go to bed as I was really nauseous. I left my son with my husband, who brought him to our suite at 10pm. I noticed that my husband appeared quite drunk. Worried about our isolation and the potential need for his help, especially during the electricity outage between 11pm and 5am, I asked him to not drink too much for the rest of the, he assured me that he would moderate his drinking.\n\nAt 1:30am, my son started vomiting all over the bed we were sleeping in, just as my husband returned to our room. Everything was covered in vomit, and my phone was the only source of light. I asked my husband to run a bath for my son, but he couldn't find the bathroom door. Instead, I asked him to use towels to soak up some of the vomit from the bed. However, he began pushing the vomit onto the carpeted floor with his hands. I asked that he hold our son while I dealt with the mess. Instead, he passed out on the floor with our son in his arms, rather than on one of the single beds.\n\nMy son continued to vomit every 15 mins for the next 4 hours, all in complete darkness. I couldn\u2019t always provide him with a bin in time, as he would sometimes vomit in his sleep. I tried waking my husband up multiple times, but he remained completely unconscious.\n\nFinally, around 3am, I managed to wake my husband and asked for his help. However, he refused, said he was sleeping, and turned around to go back to sleep.\n\nI feel deeply betrayed. I always believed that, regardless of the circumstances, my husband would prioritize our son's well-being. This belief was unwavering until now.\n\nWe still at the farm, with my son napping in my arms. I've been avoiding everyone as much as possible because I know my anger towards my husband is affecting the atmosphere, which is unfair to the others. However, I can't completely avoid them.\n\nMy husband has apologised, saying he should have helped, but he doesn't think his actions were that bad because it was his best friend's 40th birthday party. Unfortunately, he is already drunk again.\n\nWhen I asked him to assist with washing the vomit-covered clothes and linen, he dismissed me saying, \"I don't talk to shit like you.\" This was the final straw. I told him that I'm changing our flights, and we will be flying back home on Monday and I\u2019ll be seeing a divorce lawyer on Tuesday.

The divorce statement may have gotten through to him the seriousness of the situation and helped sober him up a touch, hence a second apology.  \n\nSide note.  There is no relevance that his friends 40th birthday has on the situation.  Its like he knew going in he'd be wasted the entire time.

And since the cause of the illness really has nothing to do with the story your comment makes no sense.", "Yeah I was on her side but still understanding of the husband until she pulled the \u201cOUR flights\u201d part. She\u2019s free to go home early but has no right to drag him with her like he has no free will", "I'm assuming you're unmarried and childless. Please stay that way.", "No she is divorcing him because he got so drunk he couldn\u2019t wake up to help her with their sick child and then knowing that he got drunk again and called her \u201cshit\u201d\n\nHe passed out in the floor, holding a child who was vomiting \n\nAlso OP is ill and he still got shit faced drunk", "Yeah is he like a supervillain? I hate a lot of people and I don\u2019t think I\u2019d say this to any of them.", "> I wouldn't even say that to people I don't like.\n\nI would, but I can be an asshole when it is necessary. I would never say that to anyone of my friends or family.  I wouldn't even imagine saying it to my wife.  The husband is a fucking asshole supreme.", "I don\u2019t even understand the comment. When was she talking shit about him? When she asked him to help? Or in the wake of him shittily being a useless drunk when she needed him? Just as a one off, it\u2019s a forgivable offense that I think most people would still be pissed AF about and wouldn\u2019t forget and would bring up for the rest of time because being covered and surrounded by vomit in the dark on a farm is not something one is likely to forget. But given that she\u2019s ready for a divorce, I assume this is not a first offense. NTA.", "This is exactly what I was thinking too, did the kid get alcohol from someone because the dad was too trashed to pay attention? OP is NTA at all and should follow through with the divorce attorney visit (and divorce, honestly) but I\u2019d be taking the kid to the doctor asap to confirm.", "I don\u2019t think its harah to go at least see a divorce lawyer just for this \u201cone\u201d incident, as at this point its two incidents. The first one where he was a useless ass when their sick child and his wife needed help, pushed around vomit, and passed out on the floor. The second incident being \u201cI don\u2019t talk to shit like you.\u201d With other people around?? Sometimes to make someone, even someone you care about understand they have an alcohol problem you have to take big measures. I agree with OP that talking to a lawyer about it is the least they can do, as this behaviour if its let slide can snowball.", "You're right.  Kids suck.", "Oh I assumed she meant her and her son\u2019s tickets not the husband\u2019s.", "If my wife partied too hard on her 40th birthday and I (god forbid) had to take care of my own sick kid one evening, I'd live.", "As a *good* spouse, I would have offered to take care of the kid on my wife's 40th birthday weekend at her best friends. I wouldn't even had merely *offered*.  I'd have *insisted*.\n\nThat's how *good* spouses act.", "I agree with him that it was a pretty shitty thing of her to do. If it was my wife's 40th birthday weekend at her best friends, I would (as a good spouse) offer to take care of my kid alone (god forbid) and tell her to have fun.", "I think it's more like he was saying I don't talk to s*** like you where s*** is the noun he is using for her. Like I don't talk to idiots like you, except replace idiots with s***.", "He's the worst kind of idiot: \"I'm MAD because you're MAD and saying sorry didn't magically fix anything because my words and actions don't line up. I'm only sorry my best friend and company can see that I suck, that I barely apologized, and I'm STILL not stepping up as a husband or father.\" That shit comment was him kicking sand and trying to get her down to his level of emotional immaturity.", "There\u2019s also comments on the profile from a now deleted post a year ago about problematic shit with booze. OP, get out for your kids sake - at least one of his houses will be reliable and safe then, and when he\u2019s older he can choose to get away from dad if needed.", "Yea but getting a divorce is like hitting the nuclear button when it comes to family. It's supposed to be a last resort. \n\nWhich is why I'd consider it an overreaction if it's a one-off incident. However, if there is a history of alcohol abuse here, then I think OP's actions have more merit", "I took it as her booking their flight back so she can start the divorce process", "Luckily the person who's divorcing him is the type of shit he doesnt talk to so i doubt he'll be too bothered.", "Dude the husband was refusing to help even after the birthday was over. He is drunk, AGAIN. If he was really apologetic then he would help her out and take care of HIS son but nope, he is calling his wife shit. NTA, op.", "She was ill, on a farm in the middle of nowhere, which loses electricity with a sick child and a shit faced husband who insults his wife \n\nIf your wife is sick and you have your kid with you then you don\u2019t get shit faced\n\nYou definitely dint start drinking the next day after you got so drunk the night before you couldn\u2019t help with your child who continually vomited all night, including in their sleep \n\nThis dude completely abdicated his parental responsibilities and gives all fathers a bad name", "Son of a b$&ch! I completely misread that as \u201cI don\u2019t talk shit like you\u201d. Wtf?? Oh OP I\u2019d conference that divorce lawyer in from the plane/train whatever it is on Monday and wouldn\u2019t even call him into the discussion until I felt myself well protected and prepared for this because I would not what to be dealing with him *at all*.", "The husband passed out on the floor while holding his son, who was vomiting in his sleep. That's incredibly dangerous depending on how they were positioned. Even if this is the first time this happened, I don't think its an overreaction. He doesn't care about his actions, insulted OP over it, and immediately got drunk again.", "One-off or not, this is a completely valid reason to hit that nuclear button. \n\nNot only did he drink himself into unconsciousness that night...  instead of waking up, apologizing, and helping clean, he decided to go right back to drinking with his friends. \n\nMarriage takes work, that is true, but not every problem is worth trying to solve either. \n\nWhat if he had rolled onto their child when he passed out holding him? \n\nWhat if the husband vomitted from drinking and still didn't wake up? \n\nHe put himself, his wife, and their child into an incredibly dangerous situation. She doesn't owe him another chance just because they are married.", "I suppose she'll have fun taking care of her sick son *alone* the rest of her life.\n\nYou don't think maybe there's more to the story? Maybe they could calm down and in the near future have a talk about this? A couple of bad nights on his 40th birthday weekend and that's it?\n\nYou guys are all nuts. You're not nearly as perfect as you all think you are.", "Sometimes I feel a bit sick as well.  I still take care of my kid when feeling a bit sick.  I'd still had offered to take care of the kid while my tummy was a little upset if it was my wife's 40th birthday party at her best friends house.  Even if I (god forbid) had to use a flashlight.\n\nI guess I'm just a nicer spouse than OP.", "I misread it too and was wondering how she poops and how he is diff \ud83d\ude02. She should leave immediately", "I misunderstood it as well. I thought he meant \u201cI don\u2019t talk to shit like you do\u201d - like she\u2019s some kind of shit-whisperer who has magical superpowers to convince the shit/vomit to be gone. \n\nIt didn\u2019t even occur to me that someone could call their spouse \u201cshit\u201d \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You don't end a multi-year marriage over one incident though unless something else was going on that led up to it. I do not buy for a second that this was the only incident if it led to OP talking to a divorce lawyer. No normal person resorts to this without any prior issues. \n\nAgain, divorce can and should be a last resort. That fucks the kid up in a permanent way so it is not something to take lightly.", "Getting drunk isnt the issue, even not being availavle when he said he would isnt that bad an issue (i mean divorcable when i say not that bad, not downplaying it)\n\nDoing the exact same thing the next day knowing he has an nauseous wife and a child whos been puking all night, and how upset his partner is about the night before, and speaking to her like shit when she asks for help cleaning up his sons vomit from the day before are massive red flags.", "A normal person doesn't get so blackout drunk that they become an active threat to the safety of their family.", "If it puts your child in danger and they don't care that they did, you absolutely should end the marriage. If he showed remorse, and didn't immediately get drunk again, they can probably work through it. But he didn't until the threat of divorce came up. Choking on his own vomit and dying in his sleep because his father was too drunk to realize it happened and mom was cleaning everything else also fucks a kid up in a permanent way.", "The biggest red flag for me is that the wife didn't offer to take care of the kid alone.\n\nIf it was my wife's 40th birthday weekend at her best friends, I would have *insisted* on taking care of the kid alone (god forbid) while she has fun.\n\nOP is a bad and selfish spouse.", "You're telling me you have not once been around a family member or friend that had too much to drink? Give me a fucking break..."]}
