There were only 7 adults and two children. (important note: in our country, the electricity is switched off for 4-6 hours twice a day.)\n\nThe antibiotics I was taking for a UTI was making me feel very unwell the day before and during the party. However, I tried to participate in the festivities. Eventually, at around 9pm, I decided to go to bed as I was really nauseous. I left my son with my husband, who brought him to our suite at 10pm. I noticed that my husband appeared quite drunk. Worried about our isolation and the potential need for his help, especially during the electricity outage between 11pm and 5am, I asked him to not drink too much for the rest of the, he assured me that he would moderate his drinking.\n\nAt 1:30am, my son started vomiting all over the bed we were sleeping in, just as my husband returned to our room. Everything was covered in vomit, and my phone was the only source of light. I asked my husband to run a bath for my son, but he couldn't find the bathroom door. Instead, I asked him to use towels to soak up some of the vomit from the bed. However, he began pushing the vomit onto the carpeted floor with his hands. I asked that he hold our son while I dealt with the mess. Instead, he passed out on the floor with our son in his arms, rather than on one of the single beds.\n\nMy son continued to vomit every 15 mins for the next 4 hours, all in complete darkness. I couldn\u2019t always provide him with a bin in time, as he would sometimes vomit in his sleep. I tried waking my husband up multiple times, but he remained completely unconscious.\n\nFinally, around 3am, I managed to wake my husband and asked for his help. However, he refused, said he was sleeping, and turned around to go back to sleep.\n\nI feel deeply betrayed. I always believed that, regardless of the circumstances, my husband would prioritize our son's well-being. This belief was unwavering until now.\n\nWe still at the farm, with my son napping in my arms. I've been avoiding everyone as much as possible because I know my anger towards my husband is affecting the atmosphere, which is unfair to the others. However, I can't completely avoid them.\n\nMy husband has apologised, saying he should have helped, but he doesn't think his actions were that bad because it was his best friend's 40th birthday party. Unfortunately, he is already drunk again.\n\nWhen I asked him to assist with washing the vomit-covered clothes and linen, he dismissed me saying, \"I don't talk to shit like you.\" This was the final straw. I told him that I'm changing our flights, and we will be flying back home on Monday and I\u2019ll be seeing a divorce lawyer on Tuesday. Suddenly, he tries to apologize again.\n\nAITA for not accepting apology?", "created_utc": 1691326644, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15jp0q6/aita_for_refusing_to_accept_drunk_husbands_apology/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he wants to live the single life, he should be single. His friend's 40th birthday celebration does not supercede his parental responsibilities, or give him an excuse for not being there for you. If you're going to have to take on life's curve balls all on your own, you might as well be free to handle them in your own way.", "NTA. Your husband's behavior was unacceptable and irresponsible. He failed to help you and your son when you needed him the most, and he disrespected you with his words and actions. He also showed no remorse or accountability for his actions, and continued to drink excessively the next day. You have every right to be this angry and hurt.", "HE'S ALREADY DRINKING AGAIN? NTA, OP. His actions are speaking waaaayyy louder than his words. I am so sorry you had such a terrible night with your son feeling so ill. I hope he is feeling better today! Again, nta, but your husband sure the hell is!", "Your husband has an alcohol problem. Many people don't realize they have an alcohol problem if they are not a full blown alcoholic that can't function. But there are levels -- if drinking is negatively affecting the well being of his family, then he has a problem. Until he recognizes this and changes his relationship with alcohol, I'm sorry to this week happen again and again. Oh, and the whole \"I don't talk to shit like you\" comment? That would be enough to get me to the divorce lawyer. Absolutely unacceptable. NTA.", "OP, if he asks, tell him you're upset and need time to process or something. Don't outright lie, but don't give him information about when and where.\n\nGo see the lawyer without him knowing.\n\nSomeone who would call you such a vile thing could potentially physically prevent you from leaving the house for your appointment with the lawyer.", "NTA.   \nHe wanted to be a father\u2026 a role you can\u2019t turn on and off on a whim when you want to drink with your buddies. Parenting is a full time role when you have a small child, and it\u2019s not reasonable for him to get pass out drunk when the power is going to be out for hours and you are in an unfamiliar place.   \n\n\nHe\u2019s drunk now because he\u2019s avoiding things. Does he drink to avoid conflict a lot? Sounds like a man who prefers to resolve his problems in a bottle? Great future father material if that\u2019s the case :/", "NTA. It could be forgiven if he was truly remorseful but to be drunk again and then make that comment. Nope. Personally I wouldn't have said I want a divorce, I'd have just gone home and started the ball rolling, however you're clearly feeling super stressed which is understandable. As people on here always say when people show you who they really are believe them. And he's showing you that you can't rely on him when you need him.", "NTA. Good on you to prpt3ect yourself and your child. I hope your lottle one recovered after being so sick.", "Oh my Dear. You are NTA. I am so sorry you had to go through your son\u2019s illness alone, in a strange place, in the dark, with a partner who purposely disregarded your acceptable requests. He blatantly disrespected you by getting drunk, not being capable of assisting your child in crisis, no remorse, got drunk again, and swore at you/called you names. You are NTA. I am so sorry. Your lawyer will be worth every cent.", "Coming from a family of drunks, one just died of alcoholism, you'll never win.  He'll  continue to apologize then finally he won't anymore because his drinking will be much more important than an apology.  Get out now and take your kid(s).  You and your kid(s) will end up being screwed up for life.  Take my word for it.  Get involved in al-anon.  I feel sorry for you and for me too.  My life was ruined by alcohol and I don't drink.", "Good for you he does not respect you at all", "Him calling you shit is so horrible. NTA in any way.", "Apologies only count if they mean what they say and change the offensive behavior.  Getting mad at him the night of, for getting too drunk to help even while you were sick, is valid.  I'm going with the NTA because he refused to help you clean the next day and made the statement you quoted.  The divorce statement may have gotten through to him the seriousness of the situation and helped sober him up a touch, hence a second apology.  \n\nSide note.  There is no relevance that his friends 40th birthday has on the situation.  Its like he knew going in he'd be wasted the entire time. If that's the case he should have prepped you with that expectation and adjusted it when you were clearly not feeling well enough for the festivities.\n\nI am curious if he knew your son was sick when he dropped him off in bed.", "NTA the night prior could have maybe been forgiven if he would\u2019ve came to his senses and helped you clean the next day. Instead, he talked shit.", "NTA- his actions just continued to escalate. He had no way of knowing his son would be throwing up in the night, and while he shouldn\u2019t have gotten so drunk i would have given a slight pass- \n\nExcept how rude he was when you needed him. \u201cNo I\u2019m sleeping\u201d doesn\u2019t work when your kid is sick. \n\nRefusing to genuinely apologize. Getting drunk again, after you got no sleep, refusing to help clean up the vomit covered items, \n\nAnd worst of all, insulting you when you asked for help at the end. \n\nHe has a problem. Some combination of alcoholism, machoism in front of his friends, general misogyny. Either way, do you really want to keep raising a son with him?", "You are NOT the AH!", "NTA. That\u2019s a meaningless apology if he\u2019s already drunk again.", "NTA. His actions were terrible and the fact he repeated them makes it worse. The first time, yes it was selfish, and yes you deserved help, but people are stupid sometimes. However, the second time is inexcusable.", "Go. Consult a lawyer. See if you can get the locks changed or yourself and kid gone before he comes back.", "NTA.  Go consult that lawyer, and get a divorce.  He showed you in one sentance he doesn't respect you.  I hope you, and your little guy start feeling better soon.", "NTA. It was a dick move. I would change the flights and start gathering info in case you do go through with this", "Tale as old as time. YTA for thinking you might have discovered something new. Assuming you're an American you have hundreds of cultural references and cues to use. Coming to Reddit ain't one of them.", "Your husband partied with his best friend for a couple of nights on his pivotal 40th birthday. And you're going to *divorce* him for it?\n\nIt's his 40th freaking birthday. YOU can take care of the sick kid a few times by yourself. It's you who owes your husband an apology.\n\nOr you can just divorce him for no reason. Good LORD what an overreaction.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
