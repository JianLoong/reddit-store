To dress more conservative. I just want to make things easier on my wife. My wife is already nervous about being on the beach around others with her body. My dad and my younger brother say I shouldn\u2019t do it because it is a ridiculous request.\n\nThey are right.\n\nYWBTA if you asked.\n\nShe's not going anything wrong by wearing her two piece.\n\nShe is extremely generously taking you and your wife and your kids...\n\nAnd you want to request she change her behaviour because of your wife's insecurities?\n\nYeah, no. That's not ok.", "YTA. Your sister\u2019s wardrobe has nothing to do with your wife\u2019s insecurities.", "YTA. This would be a really inappropriate, frankly creepy request. Your sister is not responsible for your wife\u2019s jealousy and insecurity and does not need to cover up her body for her \u2018comfort\u2019.\n\nYour sister would not be a \u2018bad person\u2019 for telling you to fuck right off when you made this request.", "YTA. Your wife\u2019s insecurities are hers to deal with.", "So your sister (and BIL) are giving you a very generous gift, and your Dad gets to travel with all his children, and you want to make it about your wife's insecurities?\n\nWhen you arrive, will you be asking every woman at the pool or beach to please consider your wife's feelings and wear moo moos?\n\nYour wife is overweight. So what, you say you love her no matter what and that should be enough for her, but forcing her insecurities down everyone's throats on a FREE trip?\n\nYTA, and enabling her makes you an even bigger AH. If she's insecure, stay home.", "YTA. The absolute unmitigated gall to tell somebody to cover up just because somebody else is insecure is mindblowingly outrageous. This is beyond the pale and if you actually did this, I hope your family would oust you from every family vacation moving forward. It is 100% unacceptable and sick, twisted, bizarre thinking.\n\nIf your wife is that insecure, she shouldn't travel and should be instead getting intensive therapy. Trying to control what other people wear to make her feel better is MESSED UP.\n\nYou also need therapy. Something is very seriously wrong with you that you are even considering trying to control the wardrobe of another person. Seek help.", "YWBTA - your sister doesn\u2019t need to be a \u201cmean person\u201d to feel uncomfortable with this request. I\u2019m tentatively assuming you\u2019ve already opened up to your dad and younger brother on your wife\u2019s insecurities as a reason for your request - I have a feeling your wife would be even more embarrassed and uncomfortable to know her in laws are familiar with her body image concerns", "YWBTA\n\nYour sister can flaunt what she's got.  It's not her fault your wife has insecurity issues.  I say this as an ugly mofo that wears tshirts to the pool because I have a keg instead of 6-pack.", "YTA. It's an inappropriate request. It also won't help your wife. Your sister's body is not actually her issue, her issue is with how she feels about her own body.

It won't make your wife feel better about herself.\n\n\"My sister is not a bad person so I don\u2019t see why I shouldn\u2019t ask.\" \nBecause you don't get to control your sisters clothes.

I sympathise with your plight, but you\u2019re forgetting what people often forget: that seemingly confident people have their insecurities too. If you ask this of your sister *you will hurt her*. You will make her self-conscious and ultimately insecure and probably unwilling to be around you and your wife anymore. \n\nAnd you don\u2019t get to play Pain Top Trumps: my wife has x amount of pain and I think my sis has only a amount of pain so I\u2019ll inflict y amount of pain on her coz I think she can handle it. A person\u2019s insecurities are theirs to deal with and no one gets to make them someone else\u2019s problems. \n\nThe best thing you can do is sit your wife down and have a talk about it beforehand. Tell her you\u2019re concerned for her regarding this issue, and explore it with her; if necessary reassure her again how much you care for her and how attractive you find her, whatever you need to do. \n\nDon\u2019t transfer the insecurity to your sister, that would be a truly bad act.", "YTA already, for discussing your wife\u2019s & sister\u2019s bodies with your dad and brother!\n\nGross.", "YTA - don\u2019t police other people\u2019s bodies, especially while they are on holiday. \n\n\u2018My sister isn\u2019t a bad person so I don\u2019t see why I shouldn\u2019t ask\u2019 is such a gross sentence.

Of course you will and you know that. I get trying to ease your wife's insecurities and trying to have a good time without unnecessary stressful things. But, with that said, you can''t walk on eggshells with her for the rest of your life. If she is less fit than she would like to be, the solution is for her to upgrade herself, not the opposite. You will be an asshole and incredibly disrespectful towards your sister if you ask her that. Especially, when you take into consideration that she is taking you and your whole family on this trip so I am assuming she is paying for the vast majority of the expenses.", "YTA.  I think it would be totally inappropriate for you to ask that of her. And are you saying that they are paying for your vacation? Then you really have no place in asking that.  If it bothers you that much then don't go. Otherwise be supportive of your wife and compliment her every chance you get", "YTA. Your wife doesn't get to project her issues into your sister.

She doesn't get to take it out on your sister or dictate what the sister wears.", " Ugh\u2014absolutely YTA.\n\nIf your wife is that uncomfortable, she can either cover up herself or not go on the trip. \n\nYou and she have NO RIGHT to tell another adult what they can and can\u2019t wear.

If you want your wife to \"have a good time\" and your sister in law dressing NORMALLY for warm weather activities means your wife's mental health issues will prevent her from having a good time then simply decline the trip. Please don't try to guilt or shame your sister in law.  Your wife needs to find a therapist and a nutritionist to help her with her issues.", "YTA.

It\u2019s sad that your wife doesn\u2019t feel confident but it\u2019s not your sister\u2019s fault or problem and she shouldn\u2019t have to conform to your ideas.

Why if she is generously taking you away, should she be uncomfortable?\n\nAlso, I get insecurity. god, don't I. However, what I do know after therapy is that it's on me, not on anyone else. If you really want to help your wife more than you're doing now( doing a wonderful job giving her love and affection), advise her about therapy. It will be a god send. \n\nJust don't make this more awkward as she's probably already upset your sister with her jealousy and insecurity. Do not make your sister resent her or think it's your wife thinking this holiday is all about her. \n\nIn all honestly, she really does need therapy.

It is not fun or nice at all.", "YWBTA and your wife is an asshole if she has been bringing up her body insecurities and your sister\u2019s body to your family members as a way to manipulate them into making her feelings everybody\u2019s priority. This is a HER issue. If she doesn\u2019t want to see people being comfortable in their bodies, she can stay in her hotel room. Because the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her. The only thing she gets to choose is what she does and doesn\u2019t participate in, not if or how others participate. So if she is going to let her fears and insecurities rule her life, that is her choice and has nothing to do with how your sister looks or what your sister wears. It\u2019s nice that you want to support your wife, but you are going about it all wrong. And you are letting your wife model poor body image issues to your child(ren) as well. You can tell your wife that you guys don\u2019t have to go on the trip if she thinks it would make her unhappy, but that\u2019s about it. It is inappropriate and self centered to imagine anyone else has to make any choices or sacrifices to deal with an irrational insecurity.", "YTA.\n\nIf your wife\u2019s insecurities are encroaching on other people\u2019s ability to feel comfortable in *their own skin*, your wife needs to see a therapist.

Why are you singling out your sister specifically since you will be surrounded by skimpily clad bodies of every size and shape - some will be fit and some won't be just as is the norm in the real world.\n\nOn a practical note, many women have figure issues of some kind and swimsuits are especially an issue. They sell suits which are specifically flattering to those with figure flaws so your wife should spend money and get them. \n\nAlso I am a fan of the Real Housewives and almost all of them wear coverups of some kind unless they are physically in the water or have exceptionally fit bodies. But those who most people would say have beautiful bodies cover up in some way - with a pareo of some kind tied around the hips or a billowing kimono type of outfit that disguises a bit.

There may be a situation where asking for something like this would be ok(ish) but a trip THEY are paying for to a place they like to go and want to share with the rest of the family is not the one.  The issue here is your wife's insecurity.  She is going to have to be the one to deal with it.

That is the answer, not asking others to accommodate her, which is only enabling her insecurities. \n\nIt's sweet that you are trying to help your wife, but if she is not in a way that she can be around someone she feels triggered by   then the solution is for your wife to stay home, not ask your sister to cover up.

Dad has always wanted to travel but he\u2019s never had the opportunity. Besides going to England he\u2019s never been outside of Wales before and now that he\u2019s taken retirement my sister and brother-in-law planned a trip somewhere warm and sunny for later this year. They are also (generously) taking along me, my wife, our sons and my younger brother. Before the pandemic my sister and brother-in-law traveled quite bit. They always showed my dad pictures of their trips because he was so interested in traveling. Sometimes I would be there when they shared them. If they were in warm places or on a cruise boat or beach my sister would wear a 2 piece bathing suit or shorts and other warm weather clothes.\n\nMy wife has been self-conscious about her body since having our sons. To be clear I think she is beautiful and I do everything I can to show her and tell her. She\u2019s had insecurity and jealously around my sister in the past. My sister has always been in shape. There have been a few times when we were out together as a family where my wife was mistaken for my sister\u2019s older sister, even though my sister is actually almost 10 years older than her. I know that must be hard on my wife. My wife has been working on her insecurity and I do everything I can to make sure she knows how great I think she looks.\n\nI wanted to ask my sister if she could not wear a bikini or the kinds of warm weather clothes she normally wears during the trip. To dress more conservative. I just want to make things easier on my wife. My wife is already nervous about being on the beach around others with her body. My dad and my younger brother say I shouldn\u2019t do it because it is a ridiculous request. My sister is not a bad person so I don\u2019t see why I shouldn\u2019t ask. I don\u2019t think she would be upset if I explained. I just want my wife to be able to enjoy the trip. I know we will see other women and I can\u2019t control that. But my sister is someone she knows and I think it will be hard on my wife. My dad and my brother are counselling me against asking her and my brother outright said I would be wrong to ask such a thing. I just want my wife to have a good time.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's about how much you notice how incredible she looks while your wife has a Mom-Bod,  and you constantly tell her you think she looks good because you love her.

Hopefully your wife will get into therapy to understand 1) if she has body issues (she might not,  it might you're projecting that on to her) but if so 2) how to cope with that in a healthy way.

Since they didn\u2019t take care of their skin like they should have, people think my brother is the oldest (middle child, 3 years younger), my sister is the middle (youngest child 7 years younger), and I am the youngest (oldest child). My brother also has more grays than I do. My sister\u2019s hair is a mess from all the color and heat damage. I am the most overweight of the 3 of us (about 25 lbs heavier than I should be), but people still assume I am the youngest. \n\nIt could also be attitude. Being mean and nasty ages you.

I\u2019m chubby, average at the very kindest, and have thin crappy hair. She wears cute outfits that would look ridiculous on me and oh damnation do I envy her for being able to do that. I\u2019d sell a kidney to be pretty and thin like her. \n\n But I don\u2019t ask her to change herself, nor do I try to put her down to feel better about myself.
