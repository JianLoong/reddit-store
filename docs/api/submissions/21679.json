Unfortunately, some people really do start getting very uncomfortable after an hour or two, so it would send the message that you don\u2019t want them to be uncomfortable, you just also don\u2019t want yourself and your kids to be exposed to the dangers of it all.\n\nWith regard to your second question, no, I don\u2019t think you can ask people not to smoke on their own property, especially outdoors. It would be considerate for them to refrain indoors, and they should respect your personal space if you choose to sit/stand further away while they do smoke, but at the end of the day it\u2019s their home. You can choose not to go, you can tell them your throat has been hurting for days after your visits because your body isn\u2019t used to that smoke exposure so you can\u2019t come if they\u2019ll be smoking indoors around you (and leave if they do it anyway), but it\u2019s going too far to ask them not to smoke when they host you.\n\nSmall suggestion that may or may not work for you: if you wanted to compromise, you could consider telling them that vapes would be okay. They\u2019re still not great, but the smell doesn\u2019t cling the same way and they don\u2019t have all the tar etc that makes cigarettes so awful. The research so far is very torn, especially because different vapes have different risks and they haven\u2019t been around as long, but I have yet to see a source that doesn\u2019t agree that they\u2019re better than cigarettes. A close friend of mine switched to vaping when we started spending more time together in-person because the vapes don\u2019t smell bad, the odor doesn\u2019t linger, and it doesn\u2019t make me cough like cigarette smoke does. He vapes in his home, and I can\u2019t smell it at all when I walk in, or while he\u2019s vaping if he\u2019s not too close to me or in front of a fan pointed at me. If you do decide to broach the topic, acknowledge that it would be as a favor to you if they stuck to vapes when you\u2019re around; they\u2019ll probably be offended if you try to argue it\u2019s for their own good or that they don\u2019t have the right to smoke what they want, but they may be more understanding if you say you really want to see them but the exposure is making you physically ill and you wonder if they\u2019d consider vaping instead of smoking when you\u2019re there so you can still attend without getting sick or being in pain.", "Responsible adults know that you don't smoke around children.

Even at that, my stupid 13 year old self thought that if every single adult in my life, except 1 aunt, was smoking, then it couldn\u2019t possibly be that bad. I was wrong.", "Oh yes because smoke is known to respect boundaries.", "I\u2019d be pissed. Smoking is a hard no for us, I got mad at a lady for smoking right next to my car as I was putting my shopping and baby away (I was in one of the parents with young kids spots at the mall and she parked in the one beside me, she had about 4 kids in the car. Before letting them out she took a smoke break. I told her if she needs to smoke that bad go park at the back not in the parents with young kids spots because obviously there are young kids around these spots)", "bad bot", "I agree. I am also wondering where the spouse is in all of this. Shouldn't the spouse be the one to deal with his/her own parents?", "Im not sure why this lie is needed tho.\n\nJust saying imma go for a quick cig shouldnt be a taboo, considering everyone knows their smoking habits", "Been there haha. There\u2019s that moment when you\u2019re like \u201cok this seriously isn\u2019t worth it anymore\u201d.", "Back when I smoked a pack a day, there were times I totally couldn't confront going several hours without a smoke. \n\nBut the solution here is obvious--take yourself away from the kid's party and go poison yourself elsewhere for a few minutes.", "I read that as \"covid 16\" and thought I'd missed something", "The only people in my life that I need to carry on any kind of pretense for are kids. The adults all know I never have important phone calls, and on the super rare occasions that I do, I get all in a tizzy and start dropping details all over the place. However, it\u2019s loads easier now that I don\u2019t smoke and can just honestly say \u201chey I\u2019m getting a little overwhelmed and need to get some quiet air for a minute.\u201d", "Seriously, just dip out for a few minutes. No need for excuses.", "sure.", "That\u2019s called whataboutism my guy. Your argument is that \u201csure second hand smoke is bad but what about all these other bad things\u201d which isn\u2019t an argument at all. Just because you breathe in other bad things doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t do your best to prevent it whenever you can. I need to go to work or the grocery store so sometimes I *need* to leave my house and unfortunately breathe in gross city air. I don\u2019t ever *need* to be around a person actively smoking, especially when I\u2019m on my own property. Just because things like air pollution and dust are bad to breathe in doesn\u2019t make 2nd hand smoke magically ok, it\u2019s still dangerous, especially for young kids.", "thars not my argument at all... but it would be an uphill battle even suggesting the truth about second hand smoke outdoors. People today dont have conversations, they chose sides way ahead of time and goto war.", "I dont smoke, but thank you for that tantrum."]}
