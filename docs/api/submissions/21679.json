Unfortunately, some people really do start getting very uncomfortable after an hour or two, so it would send the message that you don\u2019t want them to be uncomfortable, you just also don\u2019t want yourself and your kids to be exposed to the dangers of it all.\n\nWith regard to your second question, no, I don\u2019t think you can ask people not to smoke on their own property, especially outdoors. It would be considerate for them to refrain indoors, and they should respect your personal space if you choose to sit/stand further away while they do smoke, but at the end of the day it\u2019s their home. You can choose not to go, you can tell them your throat has been hurting for days after your visits because your body isn\u2019t used to that smoke exposure so you can\u2019t come if they\u2019ll be smoking indoors around you (and leave if they do it anyway), but it\u2019s going too far to ask them not to smoke when they host you.\n\nSmall suggestion that may or may not work for you: if you wanted to compromise, you could consider telling them that vapes would be okay. They\u2019re still not great, but the smell doesn\u2019t cling the same way and they don\u2019t have all the tar etc that makes cigarettes so awful. The research so far is very torn, especially because different vapes have different risks and they haven\u2019t been around as long, but I have yet to see a source that doesn\u2019t agree that they\u2019re better than cigarettes. A close friend of mine switched to vaping when we started spending more time together in-person because the vapes don\u2019t smell bad, the odor doesn\u2019t linger, and it doesn\u2019t make me cough like cigarette smoke does. He vapes in his home, and I can\u2019t smell it at all when I walk in, or while he\u2019s vaping if he\u2019s not too close to me or in front of a fan pointed at me. If you do decide to broach the topic, acknowledge that it would be as a favor to you if they stuck to vapes when you\u2019re around; they\u2019ll probably be offended if you try to argue it\u2019s for their own good or that they don\u2019t have the right to smoke what they want, but they may be more understanding if you say you really want to see them but the exposure is making you physically ill and you wonder if they\u2019d consider vaping instead of smoking when you\u2019re there so you can still attend without getting sick or being in pain.", "Responsible adults know that you don't smoke around children.
