Who leaves their wallet out in a public place?", "NTA. It's his fault for leaving his stuff out in a public place.

His belongings are his responsibility.", "NTA\n\nYou are not responsible for a stranger's property. If he had asked you to watch his stuff and you agreed, different story.  He just left and assumed someone would watch his stuff.  What kind of idiot leaves their wallet sitting out in public and walks away from him?  He deserved the lesson the thief taught him.", "NTA.  Did this stranger even request you keep an eye on his stuff?  You didn\u2019t steal his wallet.  If he left it out for someone to take while he ordered another coffee and went to the bathroom, that\u2019s on him.", "I can't believe you even felt the need to ask this . Definitely NTA, don't gaslight yourself.", "NTA, he's either a fool or a scammer and the next step was him trying to make you pay back what was supposedly in the wallet.", "Hmmmm skeptical me thinks this is a rouse on HIS end to SCAM YOU. NTA", "NTA - Not your wallet; not your problem. If is was important he could have taken a wallet to the bathroom. Don't waste another minute on something you did not do or control. Best to you re: your studies.", "NTA! This is why if you need to leave for a moment, you ask someone around you to watch your bag/workspace, etc. if he\u2019d asked, y t a, but he didn\u2019t, so NTA.", "NTA if someone says \u201chey do you mind, I\u2019m just popping to the toilette,\u201d then you\u2019d be be able AH. But otherwise people can\u2019t expect random strangers to always be on the lookout for them", "NTA.", "NTA at all. He's an adult, and responsible for his own belongings. Also, he never said, \"Excuse me, I need to hit the john, could you keep an eye on my stuff?\"\n\nAt this point, you could have politely declined due to your need to focus.

But especially if he didn't ask, I don't see how it's your responsibility. And plus, why leave your wallet behind in public??", "NTA\n\nWho in their right mind leaves their wallet unattended?! Holy crap", "Nta, why would he assume that you were responsible for his belongings without even asking for your cooperation first. What a dope.", "NTA not your job to be security and if he left his wallet out , that\u2019s on him", "NTA. He'll find it in the bottom of the front pouch of his laptop bag.", "My thoughts:\n\n1. Did he even TRY to ask if you'd keep an eyeball on it? If so, and you said yes...you would be. If you said no, that's on him. Your post, in so many words, tells me he did not ask. So, that's on him still.\n\n2. Who leaves their stuff out like that? Wallets? Laptops. How small is your town or is he new and from good ol' Small Town, USA where this is the norm?\n\n3. Was the wallet even there to begin with? It could be him trying to scam you. In my half asleep state, I can't work out all the details of how that would work (plus, I can't even scam my kids out of a bell pepper, so there's that...). But somethin ain't sittin right here.\n\n....\n\nI say NTA.", "Nta. He could have asked and you said you didn't notice anyone. Also, unless he grabbed some cash out, he would have needed to take his wallet to order that coffee before he went to the bathroom, right?", "NTA", "If he just left his wallet on a table in a caf\u00e9, then he really just paid the idiot tax.\n\nNTA.", "Idiots?  Seriously, who goes to the john and leaves their wallet sitting there then flips their shit at a nearby person?", "I work at a cafe, the amount of people who leave their LAPTOPS and whole ass purses alone to go to the bathroom or run outside for some air, is staggering tbh", "Somebody in a small town.\n\nSomebody new to town.", "And made sure she heard him & consented to the request. (Headphones/earbuds & all...)", "No, I had the same thought. Making a scene in public like that is a good way to distract a person while their belongings are being stolen behind their back", "That's shocking.", "I have left my laptop unattended while going to the bathroom at little quiet suburban cafes and had nothing bad happen.  Never would even consider leaving my purse, though.  A laptop is a pain to unplug and pack and then unpack and reconnect again, when you are in for a long day...  I may or may not ask someone nearby to keep an eye on it, depending on what's going on, but certainly I wouldn't expect someone to watch out for it without me asking and getting a positive response.  Have had others ask me to watch their stuff while they go to the bathroom, too...", "Oh yeah, like luckily I work in a decent neighborhood (mostly car related thefts happening by bored teenagers) but still never understand it", "Yeah, but all it takes is one...", "If this was an airport security would be questioning that man for leaving items \u201cunattended \u201c.", "NTA. An obvious idiot who needs someone else to blame", "Yep, and by that point you've probably lost your table.\n\nI'll keep an eye on people's stuff if I notice them get up, but that's not always the case. And even if it is, I'm watching out for a laptop thief, idk anything about your wallet. (Or your food - if you wanted me to make sure they don't bus you either, tell me that!)", "I used to work at a bistro cafe in a fairly snooty area. One day I saw a woman who was carrying a handbag that probably cost more than my car did going from table to table stealing all the sugar sachets. My boss said let it go because we didn't want to offend future customers (?) but honestly, I felt like offering her a dollar to go and buy a kilo of the stuff...", "Not your problem. \n\nI have seen this a lot however. People will leave their bag, their unlocked laptop, keys, phone anything lying around. Even outdoors, people will ride up on their multi thousand dollar bike , look at me and say, \"watch this for me\" and go into the restroom. The only place I would feel comfortable remotely doing this is in Japan and even that, I have areas I wouldn't..like the hostels filled with foreigners!", "NTA.\n\nYou can't win with this one. Had he seen you eyeing off his stuff, then that would surely have proven it was you!\n\nSo very NTA!", "No? You said it yourself, OP. \"I said that it was not my problem and I'm not responsible for his belongings\" there is two things he could have done before getting to the bathroom.\n\n1. He could have taken his wallet with him\n2. He could've asked nicely.\n\nNTA. His stuff, his responsibillity", "NTA.   Who is this guy to think that you're responsible for his stuff while he's gone??\nIf he had gotten your attention to ask if would keep an eye on it that might be a little different but it's his shit to keep track of and not your problem.\n\nHow does the dude not just have his wallet in his pocket??", "I didn't think about that, but yes, that's totally true!"]}
