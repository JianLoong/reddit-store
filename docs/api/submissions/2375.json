Don't go, and make it clear to everybody why you're not going.  Make your own plans, and have fun on your birthday.  Your therapist is right.  You need to stand up for yourself.", "NTA - you can do one of three things: not show up without warning, talk to them telling them why you won't show up and that you made up your mind not to show up to a party that was supposed to be about you but was changed to focus on your childhood bully by her enablers, or you can go.\n\nI recommend not going and telling your parents why, and if they push and make you feel bad maybe warn them that you'll cut contact with them too, and they'll be stuck with the bully. If you go, it continues sending the message to everyone that you are okay with it. That's what your parents have been doing for years, reinforcing her bad behavior with support for it. And someone needs to stand up. Maybe eventually they will see this and stand up against it, and she'll either be on her own or learn.\n\nBesides, moving on from the past doesn't mean embracing the person who abused you. If they tell you to move on, tell them that's what you are doing, and moving on means moving away from it in this case, not accepting it.", "Nta. You are well within your right to set boundaries with your family for your own mental health, happiness, and wellbeing. Tell them you look forward to meeting your sister\u2019s baby, but would prefer to do that before your birthday as a separate occasion so that it has the focus that day, and then celebrate your birthday after with it\u2019s own focus. If they get upset or refuse, let them know you\u2019re declining the invitation to the event and leave it at that. Refuse to discuss it any further or engage in anything related to it. Celebrate your birthday instead surrounded by people who appreciate you and make you happy. Don\u2019t feel any guilt about it, either. There\u2019s nothing unreasonable about wanting your birthday to be about you and only you!", "NTA. I'm 1 of 7 kids, was the youngest, ignored and ganged up on for a long time by siblings too. Sometimes using your birthday for a day off from family is what you should do, all you'll end up with is that hollow feeling and residual stress. That's not a nice day.\n\nTell your mother she can just turn it into a meet the baby day for people, you can do something some other time. Often, to make things better it's going to have to suck a bit first and other people aren't always going to be happy, but you have to make yourself happy before you focus on anyone else.\n\n The saying \"You can't clean without making a mess first\" is a good thing to remember. Be civil, reset your own boundaries, those who can't take that aren't worth your time and those that pay enough attention to respect your new boundaries are worth it. (even if they question them, some times it's okay talk about reasons, but you don't always need to say why, just that it is and that you are your own person living your own life)\n\nI wish you luck, I think your therapist is right (I am in no way a licensed professional) , what you're saying is standing up for yourself and it will help, if it hurts or you feel like you can't say it, then it's all the more reason that your need to push yourself and be uncomfortable to get it out.

You can accept that it happened and that they a bad person.

Because of the info you've put in the post and that the new baby's birthday is just a handful of days before yours I would be willing to bet on it being a sky-high chance that your parents and sister will completely coopt your birthday permanently for the child and will make everything about them from this birthday forward forever.", "Thats true! I agree with you. (English is not my first language)", "No one with any shred of responsibility.", "My thoughts exactly. I can imagine them doing a \"joint\" birthday party and then ignoring OP the whole time, while everything down to the theme is for the child.", "I agree. I've only ever been told to \"forgive and forget\" by manipulative people. I don't mind forgiving, but I will not erase the slate and walk around like a happy dumb person waiting for you to do the same behavior to me, following it with the statement of 'forgive and forget'. That's why I say forgiveness is for the person, not the behavior. If the behavior upsets me, I don't forget you did it, but I can forgive it if it was accidental, nonmalicious, or you are trying to do better.", "I grew up being severely bullied in school, all the way from the middle of primary school, Grade 3 or 4, until the end of high school (Grade 13/OAC) and that the single person who got the ball rolling was directly responsible for each new 'generation' of the class forms beating my head in mentally and physically, destroying any chance of my learning much of anything more advanced than the basics, if anything at all, until I graduated- barely- with my Grade 12 OSSD and never shared space daily with any of them again.\n\nI learned the following axiom much more recently, but bearing in mind who and what I am, and what I am not, and what happened to me during those years of horror and much of the grief since passed and better things arisen, rekindled and bloomed positively in my heart and head, this is both concise and apt:\n\n\n_\"Forgetting is a necessity,_\n\n_But forgiveness a luxury;_\n\n_The latter gift, not owed.\"_\n\nYou can move past the awfulness of awful people without ever strongly considering or approaching forgiveness, and you should never feel that forgiveness is owed to someone or anyone who hurt you or kept you beaten away and down; something I suspect you would never do to another person the way such horror and awfulness was heaped and sustained upon you. \n\nI can't forgive what happened to me during those dark, horrible years I had to be there in school with the people I mentioned in brevity, because I could not now countenance or imagine darkly enough to do it to another person, even my bullies, and abusers, neglectful of kindness or humanity in profession and purpose.\n\nI would not do that, never do it if I set my heart in merit of  choosing abstinence abaft unkindness, in my darkest thinking and bereft abandon of mercy upon others, rather than being kind and sharing kindness, as I have long since returned to doing, now that I am whole enough to allow baring the state of my own vulnerability without the constant terror of being hurt.\n\nI do not know how to think that way, to conceive doing or to do anything so horrible to another human being, therefore I cannot honestly forgive someone or forgive actions they took that I am not capable of comprehending.\n\n_\"Merciful release and one's honest humanity claimed is a torn and grieving person picking up a gun, a knife or a club in an iron grip, drawing down and leveling it at those who drew everything from them for more years than half their days of being alive altogether, then discarding and abandoning their weapon, silently sustaining a promise to themself: 'Remember, then, that I never would,' and if they can manage, repeating that aloud to the horror once before them.\"_", "Plan something else for your birthday.

What an insanely rude decision to make about you without you regarding an event for you! You decided to let the past be the past when you went NC with your sister so that her *current* behaviour no longer affects you. So not attending = continuing that trend. Get yourself your favourite meal, your favourite dessert, and your favourite movie and spend a night in with yourself celebrating a drama free (unless your favourite movie is a drama - but at least you can turn the movie off when you're done with it!) birthday.

You\u2019ll just end up feeling sad, resentful and angry your birthday was turned into a celebration for someone who has abused you. That is a terrible way to spend your birthday! If your family thinks you\u2019re an AH, so be it. They clearly have blinders on if they can\u2019t see how insensitive they are being towards you. Even if you didn\u2019t have all the past bad history with your sister, I think it would still be rude and insensitive for them to turn your birthday party into something completely focused on your sister and her baby.", "Wow, if I didn't know any better I would assume you and I have the same sister. Listen to your therapist and keep the no contact with your sister. Your sister isn't going to get better now that she has a baby, the only way she could is by going to therapy and getting some serious mental health help. Big life changes like having a baby or getting married aren't going to magically change a person into a better person. If anything your sister is probably going to continue the abuse with her child.
