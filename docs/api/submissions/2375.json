My sister is the middle child and is somewhat of a narcissist and always needs to be in the center of attention. She was horrible to me growing up and to people in general. My parents let her have her way because it was easier to keep her calm than to discipline her. This lead to her being my bully and they did nothing about it. She has done so much that would not fit into a post. 2 years ago i went no contact with her for multiple reasons. She called me the night before my wedding crying how unfair it was that I was getting married and ruined the mood. She made up lies about me and talked behind my back to people to make me look bad. My sister is the kind of person that would say she would do stuff, make me or my mum do that thing, then take credit for it and throw a tantrum if I called her out on it. In 2 days it will be my birthday and what was first planned to have the night at a restaurant to celebrate. A couple of days ago my sister gave birth to a baby and I do hope that that will change her into a better person. My family decided to change the plans to turn my birthday celebration into their first time meeting the baby and putting the focus on my sister when they know how much she hurted me and why I want nothing to do with her. Is it wrong to want 1 day where they try to focus on me for once? She only tries to reach out to me if she benefits from it, she will never apologize to me for all the things she has done and my family just expects me to be the doormat they made me growing up. Note that this has nothing to do with the baby and I will not make her suffer for her mothers mistakes. To me, no contact with my sister other than being civil at family gatherings have made me keep on going and my therapist said it was good that I stand up for myself. WIBTA not showing up at my birthday celebration that is not my celebration anymore? In this case my family would call me TA because im not letting the past be the past so they can feel good about themselves and focus on my sister", "created_utc": 1668508070, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yvt8jm/aita_for_not_wanting_to_attend_my_own_bday_dinner/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your therapist is correct, it is good to stand up for yourself.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry your sister is such a massive asshole and that your family are also.  Maybe call parents and tell them that you'd love to see them to celebrate your birthday at some other time because you have no intention of spending your birthday with you bully even if they're too thick to comprehend that 1. she never apologized and 2. it's up to you, not anyone else to forgive, forget, and put it in the past.", "Nta\nDon't go. Don't do this to yourself. When your parents can't protect you, you have to do it yourself. And that might mean going low contact for a bit", "NTA. It was no longer your birthday dinner once they wanted to meet the baby. Oh well. Don\u2019t go and maintain your boundaries", "NTA but explain this to your family.\nBe honest and say if you guys are planning this then that's fine but it's not my bday dinner then anymore so i will not attend.\nIf you want to do a birthday dinner my sister is not invited you know this so it's up to you guys how to proceed om fine either way.", "NTA\n\nPlan something fun to do for your birthday with the people in your life that appreciate and respect you.", "NTA - do something that makes YOU happy on your birthday and have fun!", "NTA. Think it's time to completely cut your \"family\" off and start living your own life, they will never change and you will constantly be asked to accommodate everyone else's wishes rather than your own.\n\nBTW: happy upcoming birthday, go out with your friends and have a great time.", "NTA.  Don't go, and make it clear to everybody why you're not going.  Make your own plans, and have fun on your birthday.  Your therapist is right.  You need to stand up for yourself.", "NTA - you can do one of three things: not show up without warning, talk to them telling them why you won't show up and that you made up your mind not to show up to a party that was supposed to be about you but was changed to focus on your childhood bully by her enablers, or you can go.\n\nI recommend not going and telling your parents why, and if they push and make you feel bad maybe warn them that you'll cut contact with them too, and they'll be stuck with the bully. If you go, it continues sending the message to everyone that you are okay with it. That's what your parents have been doing for years, reinforcing her bad behavior with support for it. And someone needs to stand up. Maybe eventually they will see this and stand up against it, and she'll either be on her own or learn.\n\nBesides, moving on from the past doesn't mean embracing the person who abused you. If they tell you to move on, tell them that's what you are doing, and moving on means moving away from it in this case, not accepting it.", "Nta. You are well within your right to set boundaries with your family for your own mental health, happiness, and wellbeing. Tell them you look forward to meeting your sister\u2019s baby, but would prefer to do that before your birthday as a separate occasion so that it has the focus that day, and then celebrate your birthday after with it\u2019s own focus. If they get upset or refuse, let them know you\u2019re declining the invitation to the event and leave it at that. Refuse to discuss it any further or engage in anything related to it. Celebrate your birthday instead surrounded by people who appreciate you and make you happy. Don\u2019t feel any guilt about it, either. There\u2019s nothing unreasonable about wanting your birthday to be about you and only you!", "NTA. I'm 1 of 7 kids, was the youngest, ignored and ganged up on for a long time by siblings too. Sometimes using your birthday for a day off from family is what you should do, all you'll end up with is that hollow feeling and residual stress. That's not a nice day.\n\nTell your mother she can just turn it into a meet the baby day for people, you can do something some other time. Often, to make things better it's going to have to suck a bit first and other people aren't always going to be happy, but you have to make yourself happy before you focus on anyone else.\n\n The saying \"You can't clean without making a mess first\" is a good thing to remember. Be civil, reset your own boundaries, those who can't take that aren't worth your time and those that pay enough attention to respect your new boundaries are worth it. (even if they question them, some times it's okay talk about reasons, but you don't always need to say why, just that it is and that you are your own person living your own life)\n\nI wish you luck, I think your therapist is right (I am in no way a licensed professional) , what you're saying is standing up for yourself and it will help, if it hurts or you feel like you can't say it, then it's all the more reason that your need to push yourself and be uncomfortable to get it out.

You don\u2019t need to care about theirs", "> I\u2019m not letting the past be the past so they can feel good about themselves\n\nOk, but why is that responsibility on you? What have they done for you to feel good about themselves? You\u2019re NC with your sister, why would you attend any event she\u2019s at? I think you have the start of a nice, shiny spine growing there. Don\u2019t waver now. You know you\u2019re in the right not to go, that there are better ways to celebrate *your day*, don\u2019t let them guilt you into backing down. NTA", "NTA \n\nAt some point your going to have to mention the doormat thing to your parents and let them know that you ARE moving on from the past and that includes going LC/NC with your parents for however long. They let this happen and it\u2019s just wrong.  I wish you the best!!!", "They know what she did to you and that you are nc with her so they take your bday celebration and turn it into a celebration for her and her baby?  Nope, you are not obligated to go because it\u2019s not for or about you!  NTA. You may actually want to go LC with your family if they can\u2019t make an effort to support you in anything!  Their loss!  I do feel sorry for new baby!  Surround yourself with family that you chose not the crap you were born into!  Stay safe, and most of all, stay healthy mentally and don\u2019t let them drag you down any more!!", "Are you in a place where you can afford to go NC with all of them? If so, I\u2019d do that. Don\u2019t go and don\u2019t tell them why. You\u2019ve already stated that they treat you like your feelings don\u2019t matter so don\u2019t even put yourself through it. It\u2019s your day and you deserve to be celebrated and surrounded by people that love you and make you happy. Don\u2019t go to the dinner. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Yeh, I\u2019d skip it and I\u2019d let them know I was skipping it and why. Have a separate birthday dinner with people who actually care about you.", "NTA. Honestly I would let them have their thing and not go, and get the \"meeting the baby\" thing out of the way, and then see who wants to give you a real birthday.", "NTA don't go. You go out and celebrate your birthday. Post-it on social media. Say how nice it is to be celebrated on your special day. And then block them.", "NTA\n\nBut if it were me, I'd go for like 15 minutes. Oo and aah over the baby, hug a few people, then either slip out quietly, or just say a cheerful goodbye and say I've got birthday plans and leave without further explanation. Just make sure you actually do something fun with that time. \n\nThe trick about not explaining yourself or making excuses is that you've really got to stick to it. It's so easy to crack and attempt to justify doing what you want. Don't. You don't owe anyone an explanation, especially not on your birthday. Their building and eventually explosive emotional reactions don't mean you've actually done anything wrong.", "NTA\n\nBut here is what I would do.\n\nI would go to the event.  I would play the part they expect you to play.  Why?  It's simply not worth the drama.  People are always going to take the side of the newborn baby being more important than a birthday and you will simply end up allowing your sister to paint you as a selfish awful person.  Don't give her the opportunity to do that\n\nAnd then I would ask my friends if they wanted to get together for your birthday.  Even if it's just a couple of people.\n\nDo something fun...something you would want to do.  Hell, rent a bouncy castle if you want.  It's your day.\n\nBut Take photos\n\nThen...the next day, post on social media gushing about how much fun it was and how thankful you are to have such good friends who went out of their way to celebrate a belated birthday with you.\n\nLay it on thick...but make sure it doesn't directly throw shade at your family but also try and make it look like nobody else did anything for your birthday.\n\nAnd even if you don't have anyone to hang with for your birthday.  Go do something fun by yourself.  Take photos.  And then post on social media about how you treated yourself to a birthday celebration this year and how you are thinking about making this a new tradition.\n\nThe reason I am suggesting this is that you know your family is not going to change.  So it's time to start taking control of things on your end and making your own plans without their input", "And forgiving, forgetting and putting it in the past doesn't require allowing that person to still be in your life, or for you to do things for them. Those things are for the mental health of the person granting the forgiveness. And forgiving means forgiving the person, not the behavior. If you know the behavior won't change, you don't have to accept it.", "But tell them that  since the party reason  change you decide not to go . Block  them if necessary (they try to harass you) nta", "Your \"family\" doesnt have to be the ones you grew up with, your family are the ones that love and support you,the people that value you and your feelings.  Dont even bother with your sister. When i went no contact with my bully (also my sister) it was shocking to see how everyone allowed it and were ok wuth me taking the brunt of it if made life easier. Once i realized she wasbt raised in a vaccuum and dropped my 'family\" i have genuinely enjoyed my birthday, holidays,etc. Happy birthday friend. Even if you just celebrate it by yourself you are still making the day about you and thats the whole point."]}
