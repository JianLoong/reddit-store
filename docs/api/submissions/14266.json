I\"m not comfortable, this guy is doing nothing about his service dog literally on me.  I ask him to get the dog off the seat.  He tells me no again, his dog has rights and he doesn't need to listen to me.  I flip out about needing my space and the dog not needing to be on the seat.  The guy calls me an asshole among other things. \n\n I go ahead and just leave, I had made a mini scene and just removed myself from that situation.

Trained dogs do not have problems getting under the owner's chair, and will certainly stay away from strangers. Could this have been an ESA?", "NTA, As a service dog handler myself the dog should not have been on the seats at all unless actively tasking in that moment. If your in the US, the ADA even has a section about this and states that seating, food and drink is provided for customer use only and that restaurants are not required to allow service animals to sit at or be fed from a table.\n\nI really can\u2019t think of a situation that would require the dog to be seated there unless again it was actively tasking. Even then if it was trained to do alerts for example, service dogs are trained to be able to alert from the floor, even the ones that are generally carried when working so being on the floor wouldn\u2019t prevent that type of task.\n\nI will say though that it would have likely been best to bring the issue up with an employee or a manager after the person refused, that way either they can request the person puts their dog on the floor where it\u2019s supposed to be or at the very least so they can change your seating to somewhere else.", "INFO:  \n\nWhy not switch places with one of your friends so you would not feel uncomfortable?", "NTA \nThe dog could've  been at the guys feet.

It may have been able to be resolved. That is a big maybe.", "NTA\n\nThat was not a true service dog most likely. They are trained to lay under the table, out of the way. The dog did not need to be on a bench and was disgusting.  Next time call a manager to handle the issue. Tell manager they will be reported to health department if dog is continued to allowed to be on the chairs.", "ESH - if it was a requirement that his service dog sit next to him for whatever service the dog was trained to provide, he should have selected a table where there was space for an additional body.\n\nEdit to ESH - OP should have handled it better.", "NTA but what did the dog order?", "\"Flip out about needing your space\" at a guy who needs a service animal? Honestly, if you want a happier existence show people empathy and overcome adversity with grace.", "ESH \n\nThey should have told the person that sat them down that the dog would need to be sitting at the table for his service job so they wouldn't be so packed. And you should have just asked staff if they could move you guys because you can't sit squished comfortably by the service animal after the first \"no\" from the guy instead of making a scene.", "ESH - the dog could be underneath without trouble. the dog didn\u2019t need to be up there. he could of sit at the edge and had the dog beside him there and so many other choices could of happening, you didn\u2019t need to leave,", "YTA.

And you\u2019re entitled to not want to touch a dog. \n\nThe owner however needs his dog nearby in case of an emergency. It\u2019s important that the dog sits right next to him and keeps him safe.

Staying between their person and other people is literally one of the functions of some service dogs, and you really had no right to quiz the guy on whether that was the case here. Sometimes they\u2019re even trained to sit at the END  of the lead so they force a bubble of space around their person. That\u2019s a necessity of existing in a public space for some people. \n\nThe reason why is not your business, and I guarantee this man\u2019s disability is more difficult for him than you. But no, you made a scene and made the situation about your inconvenience. Do better.", "YTA. This sounds like a sucky situation overall, but it also sounds like neither you (nor he) had a choice as to where you sat, and I'm going to be honest: some service dogs do, in fact, need to be up near their owner like that rather than on the floor. Unless his service dog was climbing all over you/slobbering on your plate/barking/taking your food/being otherwise ill behaved, flipping out on this guy was really not a good look for you. You should have just flagged down the waitstaff, explained the situation, and asked if you could be moved; I'm sure they would have been happy to seat you somewhere else.", "YTA some service dogs NEED to be next to their handlers, some handlers may be vets with PTSD or even health issues that the dog may need to be next to their owner to sense and the dog also creates a barrier between the handler and the stranger if the handler potentially has social anxiety.", "Yes, 100% YTA. You have no idea what the his reason for having a service dog is and if you didn\u2019t want to sit next to it then you should\u2019ve found someplace else to wait instead of scooting in next to it then acting like an entitled little brat.", "NTA", "NTA you asked him politely and he refused to move his dog, I wouldn\u2019t want a dog, service or not in an area where I am eating. Especially when part of them is touching me", "It is specially trained. But to a random stranger it is seen as a pet also sometimes.  Either way most sane people do not want an unknown dog on their lap in a restaurant.", "Info if it was the guy's oxygen cylinder would you have been as upset?

Get over yourself.", "You are 100% the asshole.\n\nHe told you that his service animal needed to be close to him and on that seat. At that point you should have dealt with it or asked the wait staff if they could move you to a different table.", "I\u2019m gonna go with YTA\u2014\n\nService dogs absolutely do have rights, and need to be close to their owners. I don\u2019t think you should have flipped out on him, as you describe. You should have flagged down a waitress if it was that big of an issue for you. \n\nStill, I\u2019m pretty sure most service dogs are trained to curl up under their owner\u2019s feet and stay out of the way. Not sure why the dog was on the bench, but it sounds like you made a jerk of yourself about it lol.", "NAH\n\nIf this was a legit service dog and not an emotional support dog, the man could have actually required it to be beside him for medical reasons. The dog could be trained for medical alert and response from a position close to the handler's chest or maybe mouth to detect certain scents. Removing the dog could have put him at risk. It would be unreasonable of him to put himself in harms way just for someone else's comfort. He could literally die.\n\nYou are also not an AH for being upset about the dog being on you. As a customer, you're entitled to enough space to sit and eat.\n\nAssuming you both didn't get to pick your seats, the real AHs would be the restaurant staff. I'm also assuming you already spoke to the staff about the issue before you started getting upset at the service dog handler.

This way nobody is outright denied access to a service dog, even though training your own dog is not easy and not possible for many with physical or psychiatric disabilities.\n\nIf you can't certify a dog, you can't really require a vest either. The vest means nothing if there are not clearly defined standards for training.  \n\nThe lack of access to service dogs for people who need them is incredibly frustrating. \n\nNow excuse me while I step down from my soapbox.", "They are correct.   No marking or identification is required in the US for a service animal to protect the handler's medical privacy.  Many handlers choose to use a vest, but it's not a requirement.", "Legally, these are the only two questions permitted by the ADA.", "No, those 2 questions are actually spelled out in the ADA regulations.  Those are literally the only 2 questions you can ask.", "Why can\u2019t they be both? I\u2019m sure most service animal owners also love their animals outside of the service animal relationship.", "I agree with your main point but a person who has a service dog would be presumed to be disabled even if the dog has no identification just by virtue of the fact that they have a service dog. People would know it\u2019s a service dog if it\u2019s allowed places where pets aren\u2019t.", "Agree. I have a seizure dog and I question the legitimacy of the \"service dog\" for a number of reasons. Those of us who have real service dogs (as opposed to emotional support pets) are extremely courteous and careful that other patrons can use the space as intended without hindrance from us. Our goal is for our dogs to be extensions of ourselves, not noticeably different from any other patron, without special privilege. We are trying to create a situation of relative equality for ourselves, not privilege over the rights and needs of others.", "Unfortunately, there is no way to enforce it. \nSo many restaurants now just swipe it under the rug to avoid confrontation. \nI have multiple facebook \u201cfriends\u201d that claim their dogs as service dogs as soon as they need to flight somewhere. \nIt is disgusting. \n\nMy ex husband had a service dog and I had to fight with the rental management company to allow the dog in the otherwise no pets dwelling for 6 months, until ADA has contacted them directly and fined them. \n\nOn the other hand, I had a long stay patient in the hospital that had a \u201cservice dog\u201d that bitten three nurses and continuously pooped in the corner of the patient\u2019s room. Hospital didn\u2019t want to do anything with it to avoid conflict. \n\nIt is sad, that there is no official and enforceable process to differentiate real service dogs from the one that got their \u201ccertifications\u201d online from websites like \u201cmake any dog a service dog for just $29.99\u201d. \n\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I saw someone downvoted yesterday gor saying \"thanks for the information\" or something similar, after having been corrected by another commenter. Literally thanking someone for educating them and providing a source. Ridiculous", "I was wondering that also.  While I understand why their initial one might have (but it didn't), I don't understand why the acknowledgment was.  I initially up voted it before responding.  I, for one, was glad they acknowledged that they were looking too closely at one part of it and not the whole thing (and as I mentioned, it was a common error people make).", "It can be both but it isn't automatically both.  And most service animals are not considered pets until they retire from working.", "Not everyone keeps their service animal after they \"retire\" so it's different. Some agencies even *require* you to return your service animal upon completion of their job.\n\nIt's really not the same thing.", "Which why emotional supper animals became a thing\u2026so now people think service animals are emotional support. And again, there are very few situations where a person can legally ask if the animal is a service animal, emotional, or merely a pet. The fear to ask means more and more pets are allowed in spaces.\n\nMost people who have highly trained device dogs hate all these rules and would prefer to have these dogs identified as such legally.", "There\u2019s soooooo many fake service dogs out there.", "I mean, if that was the problem them they should have downvoted that comment, not the \"fair enough\" one.  I'm glad to see it's turned around now, but I didn't get why it was being downvoted either.  If it helps, I'd upvoted it when I replied, and I am glad you realized it.  As I said, it's a common error people make.", "Then people wonder where common courtesy has gone on reddit... when people literally get downvoted for it, what do they expect?  Agreed, it's ridiculous.", "The ADA allows for two questions in any circumstance:  is this a service animal, and what task is it trained to perform?\n\nPeople with legitimate service animals (only dogs or miniature horses under the ADA) are aware of this and will have no problems explaining.   The ADA also allows business owners to refuse to serve the animal or handler for the same reasons they can expel any other patron:  if they are poorly behaved or interfering with other guests enjoyment of the premesis.\n\nUnfortunately, the ADA is poorly understood by a lot of businesses and employees aren't well trained on it.  That, coupled with the US's rather litigious culture, means a lot of managers are afraid to bring it up at all, even in cases of obvious fakes."]}
