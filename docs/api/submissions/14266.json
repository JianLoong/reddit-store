I\"m not comfortable, this guy is doing nothing about his service dog literally on me.  I ask him to get the dog off the seat.  He tells me no again, his dog has rights and he doesn't need to listen to me.  I flip out about needing my space and the dog not needing to be on the seat.  The guy calls me an asshole among other things. \n\n I go ahead and just leave, I had made a mini scene and just removed myself from that situation.

Trained dogs do not have problems getting under the owner's chair, and will certainly stay away from strangers. Could this have been an ESA?", "NTA, As a service dog handler myself the dog should not have been on the seats at all unless actively tasking in that moment. If your in the US, the ADA even has a section about this and states that seating, food and drink is provided for customer use only and that restaurants are not required to allow service animals to sit at or be fed from a table.\n\nI really can\u2019t think of a situation that would require the dog to be seated there unless again it was actively tasking. Even then if it was trained to do alerts for example, service dogs are trained to be able to alert from the floor, even the ones that are generally carried when working so being on the floor wouldn\u2019t prevent that type of task.\n\nI will say though that it would have likely been best to bring the issue up with an employee or a manager after the person refused, that way either they can request the person puts their dog on the floor where it\u2019s supposed to be or at the very least so they can change your seating to somewhere else.", "INFO:  \n\nWhy not switch places with one of your friends so you would not feel uncomfortable?", "NTA \nThe dog could've  been at the guys feet.

It may have been able to be resolved. That is a big maybe.", "NTA\n\nThat was not a true service dog most likely. They are trained to lay under the table, out of the way. The dog did not need to be on a bench and was disgusting.  Next time call a manager to handle the issue. Tell manager they will be reported to health department if dog is continued to allowed to be on the chairs.", "ESH - if it was a requirement that his service dog sit next to him for whatever service the dog was trained to provide, he should have selected a table where there was space for an additional body.\n\nEdit to ESH - OP should have handled it better.", "NTA but what did the dog order?", "\"Flip out about needing your space\" at a guy who needs a service animal? Honestly, if you want a happier existence show people empathy and overcome adversity with grace.", "ESH \n\nThey should have told the person that sat them down that the dog would need to be sitting at the table for his service job so they wouldn't be so packed. And you should have just asked staff if they could move you guys because you can't sit squished comfortably by the service animal after the first \"no\" from the guy instead of making a scene.", "ESH - the dog could be underneath without trouble. the dog didn\u2019t need to be up there. he could of sit at the edge and had the dog beside him there and so many other choices could of happening, you didn\u2019t need to leave,", "YTA.

If I\u2019m informed correctly then any form interaction, even touching his tail, can distract the service dog from doing his job and create an unsafe environment for his owner. And you\u2019re entitled to not want to touch a dog. \n\nThe owner however needs his dog nearby in case of an emergency. It\u2019s important that the dog sits right next to him and keeps him safe.

But causing a scene is just a bad move.", "YTA.  Why not just get up and find another seat or ask for another seat or whatever?  Why turn it into a scene?  Not cool.", "YTA. Staying between their person and other people is literally one of the functions of some service dogs, and you really had no right to quiz the guy on whether that was the case here. Sometimes they\u2019re even trained to sit at the END  of the lead so they force a bubble of space around their person. That\u2019s a necessity of existing in a public space for some people. \n\nThe reason why is not your business, and I guarantee this man\u2019s disability is more difficult for him than you. But no, you made a scene and made the situation about your inconvenience. Do better.", "YTA. This sounds like a sucky situation overall, but it also sounds like neither you (nor he) had a choice as to where you sat, and I'm going to be honest: some service dogs do, in fact, need to be up near their owner like that rather than on the floor. Unless his service dog was climbing all over you/slobbering on your plate/barking/taking your food/being otherwise ill behaved, flipping out on this guy was really not a good look for you. You should have just flagged down the waitstaff, explained the situation, and asked if you could be moved; I'm sure they would have been happy to seat you somewhere else.", "YTA some service dogs NEED to be next to their handlers, some handlers may be vets with PTSD or even health issues that the dog may need to be next to their owner to sense and the dog also creates a barrier between the handler and the stranger if the handler potentially has social anxiety.", "Yes, 100% YTA. You have no idea what the his reason for having a service dog is and if you didn\u2019t want to sit next to it then you should\u2019ve found someplace else to wait instead of scooting in next to it then acting like an entitled little brat.", "NTA", "NTA you asked him politely and he refused to move his dog, I wouldn\u2019t want a dog, service or not in an area where I am eating. Especially when part of them is touching me", "It is specially trained. But to a random stranger it is seen as a pet also sometimes.  Either way most sane people do not want an unknown dog on their lap in a restaurant.", "Info if it was the guy's oxygen cylinder would you have been as upset?

Get over yourself.", "You are 100% the asshole.\n\nHe told you that his service animal needed to be close to him and on that seat. At that point you should have dealt with it or asked the wait staff if they could move you to a different table.", "I\u2019m gonna go with YTA\u2014\n\nService dogs absolutely do have rights, and need to be close to their owners. I don\u2019t think you should have flipped out on him, as you describe. You should have flagged down a waitress if it was that big of an issue for you. \n\nStill, I\u2019m pretty sure most service dogs are trained to curl up under their owner\u2019s feet and stay out of the way. Not sure why the dog was on the bench, but it sounds like you made a jerk of yourself about it lol.", "NAH\n\nIf this was a legit service dog and not an emotional support dog, the man could have actually required it to be beside him for medical reasons. The dog could be trained for medical alert and response from a position close to the handler's chest or maybe mouth to detect certain scents. Removing the dog could have put him at risk. It would be unreasonable of him to put himself in harms way just for someone else's comfort. He could literally die.\n\nYou are also not an AH for being upset about the dog being on you. As a customer, you're entitled to enough space to sit and eat.\n\nAssuming you both didn't get to pick your seats, the real AHs would be the restaurant staff. I'm also assuming you already spoke to the staff about the issue before you started getting upset at the service dog handler.

However, it's something someone who has a legitimate service dog is coached on as part of training (that ADA FAQ is pretty much a service dog handler's Bible, and it is gone over a lot, both what you can, and can't, do).  Which is why I suspect it was a fake service dog (although the possibility exists that they were just intentionally violating it).  Either way the guy is the AH, and by extension, so was the restaurant (although they may honestly not have known better, as sadly, restaurant staff don't seem to get enough ADA training)."]}
