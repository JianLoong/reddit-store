{"id": 13875, "submission_id": "12abiw5", "title": "AITA for calling a guys dick small", "selftext": "Obligatory disclaimer: posted from phone and not native English speaker \n\nOkay so yesterday some of my boyfriends friends were hanging out at our place. For starters I'm 32f, my bf is 30, and his friends are all in their 30s, this specific guy being 32 as well I think, so we're all proper grown ups. Here is what happened:\n\nWe were all (bf+me+4 more people) just hanging in the living room and pretty much talking about whichever topic came up, it was middle of the day so there was no alcohol or something else to blame the stupidity on. \n\n3 of the guys in the group are single so the topic of dating came up and who they're seeing at the moment. So, that one guy says he met a girl on Tinder and they have seen each other few times and slept together last time they met and then he comments something along the lines of \"I'm so tired of hoes, this girl was so worn out it was like my dick was exploring a cave\". Ofcourse his buddies (including my idiot bf) laugh at his dumbass joke but I didn't think it was very funny so I just replied with \"did you consider that her pussy is normal sized, and it's just your dick that is small?\"\n\nAtmosphere went south pretty fast so I just picked up my laptop and said I'm going to go do some work and moved to the bedroom. When his friends left my bf came to the bedroom very pissed asking wtf is wrong with me and why would I even say something like that, don't I know that men are sensitive about their size and then he demanded I apologize to his friend, which I ofcourse refused. I told him his friend is a sexist asshole and I am not willing to tolerate that and I also told him that I'm disappointed in him for going along with it, but he said this guy is otherwise really great and he doesn't wanna lose a good friend just because he refers to girls as to hoes.\n\nAnyways, the argument is done, I said I'm not apologizing and he backed off but since I can sometimes be irrationally stubborn, I'm turning to Reddit to see what the verdict is. Should I have really just kept my mouth shut since I don't even know the girl and the guy is my boyfriends good friend?", "created_utc": 1680502641, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12abiw5/aita_for_calling_a_guys_dick_small/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This could have been a moment where he realised he was acting in a poor manner. Instead, he got butthurt which just makes him look worse.\n\nYour bf demanding you apologise is also crazy to me.

Do not apologize and next time be hypocritical and behave just fine with the guys. No need to drag this forever. You said your piece, great.

Men who want tight vaginas are probably into their girl not enjoying it, because the more a girl is enjoying herself and getting off on it, the more relaxed her vagina is and the more lubrication there is. A wet, loose vagina is a good sign. It means you're doing it right. A tight, dry vagina means you're hurting her or she's faking it. (It might also mean they have a small dick, but facts are facts). So just ask them if they actually want to be known as a good lover or if they want to have it out there that they suck so bad at sex, all the girls they bang are 'tight'.", "\ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc51", "NTA when you go out with a guy you view him with rose tinted spectacles, but when you look at his friends you see them for who they are.
