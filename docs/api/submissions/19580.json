He's super sweet (all my family and friends think so). We are definitely still in the honeymoon phase of our relationship.\n\nDespite his sweet nature, my BF hates this one guy, Max (M20), a lot. My friends who have known my BF for far longer than I have told me that Max and my BF knew each other way back in elementary school and throughout high school but have never gotten along. Even throughout uni, they never interact despite sharing several mutual friends and both pursuing the same degree.\n\nWhen I've asked my BF about it, he only says that Max is an awful person. The friends who knew both my BF and Max have largely maintained that Max was an absolute piece of shit way back then but has since became a nicer person.\n\nTwo days ago, one of my girlfriends, Hannah (F19), asked me to come along to a house party hosted by Max, and several of my own friends planned on going. I was kinda reluctant to go as I knew my BF may not have wanted to, and it might upset him, but my friends convinced me, and I decided to go.\n\nNot too many people were there, but I had an awesome time with my friends. We danced, played a few games, and had some drinks. I even got a chance to speak with Max and some of his friends. He was well mannered and a little charming, and all my friends thought he was a great guy.\n\nThe next day, I texted my BF telling him about the party and how great it was. I told him that I had the chance to speak with Max, and my BF wasn't too happy. He said that I knew how he felt about him and that I basically breached trust by going. I told my BF that he was being childish and was probably feeling a little insecure. But he cut me off, saying that it wasn't my place to say that.\n\nI got annoyed by this and said that right now he was probably way worse than Max ever was, and he then promptly hung up. I've texted him afterward, reiterating that he was being childish and that his feelings were probably based on something trivial anyways, and his response was, \"I don't want to talk right now\"\n\nI've texted Hannah, and she said I probably should not have said anything about going at all and that I was being a bit insensitive. AITA?\n\nEdit - My BF has previously suggested that he did not want me to interact with Max\n\nUPDATE - So, after a long phone conversation with one of my BF's friends (Andy) I finally gained a little insight into the history between my BF and Max. Surprisingly, they were once good friends, until they were around 9 or 10 years old.\n\nAccording to Andy, Max (who was always kinda a little shit) became a full blown devil child. He was a horrible bully, not only to my BF but to so many other kids as well. He used intimidation and cunning to traumatize so many people, but he particularly hated my BF because my BF would regularly stand up and confront him. As Andy put it, Max took a special delight in tormenting my BF.\n\nThis escalated throughout high school, where they were both awful to each other and also very competitive academically. Andy isn't too sure about the details, but apparently, Max bullied one of my BF's close friends really badly in high school, and that friend had to change schools.\n\nAndy isn't clear about any of these details but apparently my BF somehow got back at Max for this, and this played a role Max mellowing before starting uni", "created_utc": 1686527416, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1479bm1/aita_for_disobeying_my_bf/", "score": 1049, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What you should have said is \"AITA for going to an event hosted by my BF's longtime nemesis, and not caring that he got upset about it?\". He might be overreacting about the guy, and the guy MIGHT be better (honestly if your bf has known this guy most of his life and you only met him for one evening, you really don't get to cast judgement on what kind of person he is), but if my significant other went to the home of the person I hated without even mentioning it to me, I'd feel a little weird about it too. You don't get to belittle your bf's feelings. People can come off perfectly charming and still be awful- hell, the guy who ass\\*\\*lted me was one of the most charming people I ever met. So, you're in the wrong for just flinging your bf's longtime feelings aside for a night of partying with your friends. You should have at least said SOMETHING.\n\nEDIT: Apparently, on top of everything, OP was down to MAKE PLANS to HANG OUT with this Max character, I can't y'all\n\nEDIT 2: This gal DROVE HOME with this fella AND gave him her phone number, I stg", "YTA. The \"disobeying\" in your title is nicely click-baity, but the situation is more complicated than that. You don't say anywhere that your bf ever asked you to avoid all contact with Max (nor \"ordered\" you to do so). \n\nInstead, what you're describing was you gleefully relating how wonderful your contact with Max was to your bf for no apparent reason other than to trigger him. Going to the party was fine, enjoying yourself and talking to Max was fine. Letting your bf know you went is the best choice, but rubbing in the details and your enjoyment to your bf was utterly unnecessary. \n\nCome on, you know that.", "So, Max was a bully to your bf and it damaged him. \u201cDisobeying\u201d is a loaded word to bias people into thinking your bf is controlling. Is he controlling or are you trying to sway the vote here?\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you invite your bf to the party? Usually, you\u2019re dating someone and there\u2019s a party, you invite SO along. It\u2019s up to them to accept or not. \n\nYou didn\u2019t invite him because how Max treated your bf when they were younger, you knew that, and said he was \u201ccharming\u201d. \n\nIt just sounds like Max is manipulative, but learned over the years how to hide his feelings and do/say the right things to get what he wants (manipulate) without being a bully, or he would have been self aware enough to have apologized to your bf at some point instead of trying to charm you and antagonize him.", "Your response to him was YTA. The part about calling him insecure and childish for expressing how he feels about a situation that he thought you would understand is not a healthy way to address another person's feelings. The advice your friend offered about lying is also YTA. He felt betrayed and wanted to have that addressed, instead he was called names and called worse than the person that he felt was not a good person. I suggest a lot of reflection on your part, otherwise, you may end up in toxic relationships caused by the way you respond to uncertainties.", "YTA\n\nIf you were worried about how he would feel about you going, you could have told your BF about Max's party before going. Your BF is right, you breached his trust. There was no \"disobeying\" here, and it's super weird that you would use that word at all. And then, with no knowledge of why they don't talk, you told your BF his reasons were trivial?? Lmao?", "And we have a winner. YTA! Spectacularly, too. Your bf only said he'd prefer if you didn't interact with Max. He did not forbid you or try to stop you. He also refuses to tell you what exactly the issue is between him and Max. Which to anyone with a level of discernment would indicate there's a level of trauma he doesn't want to revisit. Your decision to go to the party wasn't wrong as he only said he'd prefer for you not to interact with Max. Your decision to tell him and try to pass judgment on him for his enmity to Max, and the way in which you are handling the matter makes yta. He asked you to drop it. You refused. Then you came online to either search for sympathy or further bash him to total strangers. BF if you see this run.", "YTA. I think you know the answer to your question based to on how defensive you became when talking to your bf. A lot of what you said seemed said only to hurt him.", "YTA \n\nYour response is way outta line. You didn't even have the respect to tell him it was max's party!!", "Yea YTA. You know you are.

You've known your bf for only four months, you have no idea of the lifelong dynamic between him and Max.   And then to say that your bf was probably worse than his enemy?  Wow, you are the AH just for that.  Just because Max may be nice now doesn't negate how terrible he treated your bf in the past.\n\nI'm glad your soon to be ex-bf found about your lack of character sooner rather than later.\n\nEdit for typo", "OP let me ask you a question, do you want to fuck max? Is that why you\u2019re doing everything possible to be around him and hang out with him?", "YTA.  It should be obvious Max bullied your BF when he was younger, and he doesn\u2019t want to revisit it by sharing details.

You purposely went to a party thrown by your boyfriend's worst enemy and didn't even tell him. At said party you made a point to go talk to the guy one on one and according to your own post edit were borderline flirtatious with him.

Are you trolling here? I can't imagine any way that you aren't a huge asshole in this scenario", "YTA, you were selfish and even had the foresight to know your actions would hurt your BF and proceeded anyway.

Why didn\u2019t you tell him ahead of time that you were going to Max\u2019s party? It\u2019s because you thought that it would be easier that way. You were sneaky and manipulative.

I hope you had a really good time, because I\u2019m pretty sure your relationship is going to be over really soon.", "Just say you want to be single, or screw max and leave the poor guy alone.", "YTA. Your BF REQUESTED that you not spend time with Max.  People don't usually have strong feelings about someone without cause.  You not only ignored his feelings but trounced and taunted him. \n\nMy guess is you will be enjoying the single life soon.  Use the time to do some growing and treating it like a learning experience.", "We all can see you wanna fuck this charming man Max, so just do it already and free your bf from your asshole self.", "Oh wow, I was so ready to be on your side from the use of \"disobeying\" in the title, but noooo...

He doesn't need to tell you all of his deep dark sercets and tramua in the first few weeks... so you don't know what he's feeling or where those feelings have come from.\n\nHonestly, it's questionable that you decided to go to this party anyway... but it could have been no big deal. If you had let him know, avoided the host, and had an open conversation with your partner, it could have been fine.\n\nSecondly, you took someone you've only just mets side (who your partner doesn't like and mutual friends agree wasn't a great person in the past) and weaponized a history you know nothing about against your partner.\n\nI don't see this relationship lasting. You lack thoughtfulness, and you're probably too young and foolish to have a constructive conversation about boundaries.", "If you had wanted to continue to have the same boyfriend then YTA.\nAnd, are you really naive enough to think that Max wasn\u2019t charming you on purpose because he knew who your boyfriend was?

You don't know what Max did to make your bf feel uncomfortable being connected to him in any way, even through you. Bullied people? Assaulted someone?

Why is it such a big deal?\n\nYou're right that him not liking Max doesn't mean you shouldn't be allowed to talk to him, and he hasn't given you a clear reason why he dislikes him (like for example, if Max was his bully then it's understandable why he doesn't like his gf getting along with someone who caused traumatic experiences for him, but he has never mentioned something like that from what you said).\n\nBut instead of communicating in person you texted him knowing that Max is a touchy subject, and when he got upset instead of wanting to meet up to talk it out in person (no, a phone call is not good enough) so you guys could discuss your points of view in a healthy manner, you just kept throwing jabs at him calling him childish, insecure and saying he was worse than Max ever was, once again without even knowing the details of what was so bad about Max.\n\nYou basically insulted your boyfriend over some random guy that you didn't mention being a close friend or anything of the sort. If you're gonna make a habit out of putting down your boyfriend, who should be one of your top priorities, over minor acquaintances that you barely know instead of communicating with him in a healthy way then you're an asshole and you have a lot of growing to do. You put him down when he didn't even insult you in any way first. He didn't call you a b, he didn't call you a cheater, he didn't use any ugly adjectives to put you down. YOU did that first.

I told my BF that he was being childish and was probably feeling a little insecure.

If she had any sense, she'd see that coming.", "Very much so lol", "Why did he need both of your numbers if you were both going to the same place?", "[removed]", "Yet you've never met the guy until now... Again, why do you need to be friends with this one guy?\n\nI could understand if you both went to the same party and you made some polite small talk when you happened to be near a mutual friend, but you went to Max's party, sought Max out, deliberately spoke to him, and then have mentioned trying to make plans with him?\n\nThat's not just \"I don't want things to be awkward with my friends\" ffs, it's completely possible to have mutual friends with someone without actively being their friend too. You've obviously managed it so far.... why do you suddenly need to be friends with Max *now*?", "\u201cHe was well mannered, and a little charming\u201d\n\nSounds like OP is looking for something outside their relationship. 40 years old here and I\u2019ve never found someone \u201ccharming\u201d unless I was attracted to them. Even then, if my wife tells me to stay away from someone, out of respect I listen. It has nothing to do with control or \u201cobedience\u201d", "It sounds like she\u2019s on an ego trip and wants to get fought over.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
