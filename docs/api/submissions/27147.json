I (25F) and my husband (25M) just got in an argument which ended with him abruptly hanging up on me. Basically, I was just told by him that the trip which was supposed to be just his parents, has now turned into his parents & grandparents, and that them coming in Friday evening has now turned into them arriving Friday at 3 AM. My husband said he cannot take off work, and while I work from home (telework position), I cannot afford to take time to entertain them when they get in (which, while he said isn\u2019t expected of me, is basically what\u2019s going to end up happening.) So between them being there with only me and trying to entertain them, taking care of our 5 dogs, and also trying to work, it puts a lot of stress on my plate.\n\nSo with those things in mind, I basically told him that his parents have planned this trip for months and should have told us more than a week in advance about this so that we could be prepared and he could have taken Friday off. He got very defensive about his family and basically told me that he didn\u2019t see the issue even though I\u2019d explained it multiple times.
