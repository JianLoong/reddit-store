I (25F) and my husband (25M) just got in an argument which ended with him abruptly hanging up on me. Basically, I was just told by him that the trip which was supposed to be just his parents, has now turned into his parents & grandparents, and that them coming in Friday evening has now turned into them arriving Friday at 3 AM. My husband said he cannot take off work, and while I work from home (telework position), I cannot afford to take time to entertain them when they get in (which, while he said isn\u2019t expected of me, is basically what\u2019s going to end up happening.) So between them being there with only me and trying to entertain them, taking care of our 5 dogs, and also trying to work, it puts a lot of stress on my plate.\n\nSo with those things in mind, I basically told him that his parents have planned this trip for months and should have told us more than a week in advance about this so that we could be prepared and he could have taken Friday off. He got very defensive about his family and basically told me that he didn\u2019t see the issue even though I\u2019d explained it multiple times.

We'd drive because it was cheaper than flying and allowed us to have transportation around town while we were there. Sometimes we wouldn't get there until well after 11 pm. My parents always made sure to call as soon as they knew how  late it would be if it was unexpected or let aunt and uncle know at the start what time we'd be there. Aunt and uncle would leave a hidden key and all of us kids were told and knew to be quiet as we went inside and got ready for bed. \n\nIf aunt and uncle had asked us to be earlier or get a hotel for the night, my parents absolutely would have.
