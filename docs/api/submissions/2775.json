I currently work night shift and they would make me incredibly mad. It\u2019s hard enough to sleep during the day without interruptions", "NTA.

She was sick and needed to lay down, and instead of caring for her like you are supposed to, you acted like a huge selfish jerk.

You haven't said anything about the history of 'continually disrespecting your need for rest' but raising it (whatever it is) for the first time when she's sick and it's less than an hour is an AH move.

Do you truly feel that your marriage should only revolve around you??\n\nAlso you're complaining about not getting 8 hours sleep.  A lot of folks on graves and even day shift don't get 8 hours each night on a regular basis. That's a spoiled luxury.", "YTA - it\u2019s not like you got only 3 hours of sleep. You got more than 7.

I'm confused as to why your wife woke you up to tell you she was going to bed.  Did you ask her to wake you at 7?  If she normally wakes you up but this once needed to go to bed because she was sick...I'd say why aren't you setting your own alarm and getting up on your own.  But working 3rd shift is hard...it's hard on your body and hard on relationships.  I hope you will both give each other some grace.  Also-I can't remember the last time I got to sleep 8 hours...so you are living the life if that's your routine! \n\nAlso, as a person married many many years....my husband wakes me up (not on purpose) multiple times a week.  I sleep WAY less than he does.  It annoys me that he isn't more considerate- but I'm not fussing at him about it.  So that sort of does make you TA", "YTA. So your wife woke you less than an hour early because she was sick and going to bed. Do you not get up with your alarm? Does she have to wake up?
