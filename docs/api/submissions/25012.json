He\u2019s very sweet, thoughtful, communicative etc. And i am very in love and i would do everything for him. \n\nBut today we were calling and i said something which led to him being very angry with me and I don\u2019t know if his reaction was reasonable or that i really messed up. Little bit of background information, before i met him i was dating a guy and during our relationship he became a millionaire, but i broke up with him because the money changed him and he became very controlling. He helped me a lot with rent and bills though and i was together with him longer than i am with my current boyfriend. But I have never regretted that decision and i never cared about the money and for no reason would i ever get back with him. I love my current boyfriend more than anything and i always reassure him that i don\u2019t care about how much money he makes and that i love him no matter what. *Also, my boyfriend and i don\u2019t financially help eachother out, which is 100% reasonable as we haven\u2019t been dating for that long and don\u2019t live together. And even if we did, I don\u2019t expect him to pay anything for me. I work 6 days a week and i have no problem paying for my own things. \n\nToday when we were calling he made a joke about my ex, to which i responded that i don\u2019t miss him at all but sometimes i only missed \u2018the feeling of not having to worry about money\u2019. Especially because i have been working non stop lately and still have a difficult time to get through the month. It was very stupid and i don\u2019t know why i said this but it just came out of my mouth and I didn\u2019t think too much about it. \n\nHe was very angry and hang up on me. I called him back to explain what i meant and to apologise, but he was very mad and said that only people thats are very unintelligent and uneducated would say things like that. And that i should have known better than to say something about such a sensitive subject. He also gave an example and said \u2018if i told you that i don\u2019t miss my ex, but i only miss her boobs\u2019 you would also be mad. But I didn\u2019t really understand this correlation. I tried to calm him down but it didn\u2019t work and now i just feel like the horrible person in this situation. I love him a lot and i\u2019m just trying to understand the situation so i can improve and to be able to avoid something like this the next time.\n\nEDIT: In no way did i intend to hurt his feelings or compare him to my ex. I was just sharing my honest thoughts and i clearly stated that i in no way missed my ex, but i only missed the financial aspect. We are always very honest and share our thoughts with eachother so that\u2019s why i said it. To me it was just a small comment and I didn\u2019t anything with it, but i really do understand that he was upset and that is why I apologised. I\u2019m just a bit confused about his reaction,  because if he had told me that the comment was mean i would have apologised and we could have moved on. I\u2019m just wondering if this is a valid reaction to the comment that i made. \n\nAITA for saying that i missed the feeling of not having to worry about money to my new boyfriend?", "created_utc": 1692444944, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vdwov/aita_for_telling_my_current_boyfriend_that_the/", "score": 144, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was just sharing my honest thoughts and i clearly stated . . . i only missed the financial aspect. \n\nOkay, but you literally DID compare him to your ex, who could provide financial benefits that he cannot. And you say earlier in your post that you don't care about the money at all, but . . . \"miss\\[ing\\] the financial aspect\" is literally caring about the money. I think maybe you need to stop and reflect on the fact that you may care more than you WANT or INTEND to - not about your ex as a person, but about the money and how secure it made you feel - and that you're not really considering what it feels like to your current partner to have you express that to him when he can't do the same things for you.\n\n>We are always very honest and share our thoughts with eachother so that\u2019s why i said it. \n\nYou can be honest - i.e., not lie to your partner - without having to say every single thought that comes into your head. \"Honest\" can still be incredibly hurtful and inappropriate.\n\n>To me it was just a small comment and I didn\u2019t anything with it\n\nOkay, but to him it wasn't \"just a small comment\", it was a very hurtful, very personal jibe at the fact that he cannot be the kind of provider that your ex was and probably never will be. And while I genuinely believe that you didn't mean to be hurtful . . . you also didn't actually need to say it, and you clearly didn't think through what it would feel like to him to be compared negatively with your previous partner, even if that wasn't your intent.\n\nI'd say you owe him an apology, but his response was really cruel. Definitely, communication needs to be improved here. ESH.", "NTA.  If you had deliberately said that to hurt him, you'd be TA.  You made an honest admission and if your boyfriend was secure and empathetic, he would have understood the context of the statement.  Especially if he loves you.  The fact that he went straight to insulting you is a red flag.  He behaved like an insecure man with a steak of bitterness and jealousy.  Will he continue to resort to hurting you when you step out of line?   Hopefully he's a good guy who let his emotions get the best of him.

Insecure men are dangerous.", "INFO: Honestly, how does he measure up to the ex?

I might not have needed to work so much, but it always came with strings attached\".\n\nWhereas he heard: \"Man, My ex really had this stuff figured out. I miss that life.\"\n\nWe all have our insecurities \u2014 all of us. Sounds like you hit on his. He knows enough about your ex to worry that he doesn't measure up. That you're settling for him.\n\nAs for you, it sounds like you're wondering if these sorts of insecurities will get in the way of a relationship, not to mention that he went directly to insults.\n\nIt all sounds like poor communication and conflict resolution. The \"unintelligent and uneducated\" comment was way out of line, and not at all helpful. No positive resolution could come from it, and it seemed he just wanted to be spiteful. If anything, that sort of conflict resolution is usually from 'unintelligent' people.\n\nAsk him (and yourself) what you want out of the conversation you need to have? Is it to be right, and subjugate the other person to your point of view, or is it to find a way to deal with these issues and move forward, together?\n\nYou should be on the same team, working through these issues together.

Rather than saying that your comment hurt his feelings, or made him feel inadequate, or that it was rude of you to say or any number of things that are ACCEPTABLE to comment, he insulted you. It's verbally abusive to call someone \"unintelligent and uneducated.\" \n\nDon't let him make you feel horrible. If you apologized, let him cool down. You need to decide if you want to be with someone who attacks you and wants to retaliate when they don't like what you say.
