That wasn't fair to you.\n\nIf we took \"Jan\" and her kids out of the picture, and you changed your mind at the last minute and found somewhere else to stay, would it be THAT big of a deal for your parents? Probably not. They'd be a bit disappointed that you wouldn't be spending time with them, but other than that, I imagine that it wouldn't be a huge issue.\n\nThe only reason there might be a problem now is that you were assumed to be childcare for Jan's kids, and your absence will create issues. This is not a you problem. You just found out about this at the last minute. If you don't stay at the house and won't be caring for their kids, they'll just have to figure something else out.

They all decided on  you being caretaker a while ago and are just filling you in now that you gave up your home.", "NTA.  You need to find alternative accommodations immediately - even if you have to dip into your savings.

I agree that you shouldn't have to babysit, but that's the point you should have an issue with - the being forced into a role that you never signed up for. I agree that you should not get into this situation, but don't make it about the girls.\n\nThe girls are innocent, and if it were just living with them, I wouldn't say there would be a problem. It's unfair to treat them as part of your issues with your sister. Remember, you had to deal with her for a while growing up, but those poor girls have had to deal with her their ENTIRE lives. \n\nI don't think anyone would expect you to be their caregiver, but you should at least be their aunt and care about them.", "My nieces are very distressed over their mom leaving.

Do not move in with your parents and watch Jan's kids.  You need to be able to control the situation and not see her.  Who gets high at 33?

You were promised a safe space for you and your kids. And while you will not disrupt you sister chance to make her life right, you will not do it at the expense of your own. You are not a mother to four kids. It is too much and it is completely inappropriate for them to simply expect you to be onboard with this. They are the ones who need to take the hit about telling your nieces. They never should have promised something like that. Especially without talking to you first. You will be on your own taking care of your kids and THEY were supposed to help YOU not the other way around. And while you will not interfere you certainly will not be tasked with even more work and stress and guilt from them over it. Tell them to take care of the responsibility they decided to take on instead of the first one they promised too and not expect you to clean up their mess. They have not even thought how this will affect YOUR kids. Sure it might be fun with cousins at first but after a while they will want their space back, and their mom back. Plus they will be without their dad so that's going to be hard all on it's own. I'm sure like your sister, your nieces wil be showed favoritism by your parents and it will affect them. And you when your parents get upset with you prioritizing your own children over your precious nieces", "They are the ones who took on the responsibility of caring for the grandkids, but you. They can hire someone to babysit or even take the kids along on vacation."]}
