My dad had two kids with his first wife, \"Billy\" (40m) and \"Jane\" (45f) and my mom had my sister \"Angel\" (46f) with someone else. Billy and Jane's mom had passed two years prior to our dad even meeting my mom but they hated my mom anyway.\n\nShe tried for years to get on Billy and Jane's good side, giving them space, and trying to bond but they never took to it. They were even mean to Angel and eventually my mom had enough and divorced my dad. The house in question originally belonged to Billy and Jane's mom as she inherited it from a relative and because there was no will my dad owned it outright after her passing.\n\nMy mom had a shark of a lawyer and she got it in the divorce. Billy and Jane did not take it well because that was the only home they ever knew but my mom no longer cared after the way they treated Angel. My dad had to move into an apartment in another school district but my mom allowed him to use her address so Billy and Jane could stay in the same school district, but still resented her.\n\nMy dad tried to petition the courts for 50/50 but it didn't last long when Jane cut my hair and Billy pulled apart my favorite doll. My mom told the school about the change in address and went back to get full custody of me. By the following year they had to switch schools and lost nearly all of their extracurricular activities because my dad couldn't afford it after the child support.\n\nThey demonized my mom for this and because of that I rarely went to any gatherings on my paternal side because I didn't like how they spoke about my mom or Angel. When my dad got sick my mom let him stay with her but banned Billy and Jane from entering the house because she didn't trust them and when he died I ended up receiving 50% of his assets while Billy and Jane got 25% each.\n\nMy mom passed away and Billy and Jane did not hide their joy in the matter. They literally held a party and posted it all over social media knowing and/or just not caring that I would see it. So when they approached me about signing over the house to them I told them \"No\" and now I'm being called TA because it was originally their mom's house. I'm still pretty bitter about how happy they were about my mom passing as well as their treatment of me growing up so my judgment is clouded. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Because someone already brought this up the current value of the house is at least $700,000 and they want me to give it to them for free. I am the sole owner of the house. My mom did leave Angel something but I don't want to go into too much detail about it in case someone I know in real life recognizes the story. Just know that it was enough that Angel isn't kicking a fuss over not getting the house.\n\nEDIT 2: I don't know all the details because I was a toddler at the time but Billy and Jane were horrible to Angel but the straw that broke the camel's back for my mom is when they secretly fed Angel something that she was allergic to as a \"prank.\" After that she spent a year planning the divorce before actually serving my dad.", "created_utc": 1693691832, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168f42o/aita_for_giving_my_siblings_their_family_home/", "score": 675, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But, she also took your Dad in to live there until he died.  Billy and Jane were monsters to your Mom, Angel and yourself, so its pretty hard to scrape up any sympathy, especially after how they celebrated your Mom's death - though, I can also see it from their side as your Mom kinda stole their Mom's family home.

You don't say if barring them from the house when your dad was sick means never letting them see him at all, but if it does, or those times were really limited, that's intense.  \n\nAnd citing their treatment of Angel as the cause of the divorce, I don't know.  If she waited a year for the divorce, Angel was still in danger during that time.  \n\nIt sounds like they were unhappy kids, and jerks and/or maybe mentally disturbed; I can understand why they would cling to the house; asking you to give it to them is crazy and of course you don't have to and shouldn't.", "NTA.
