Next invite take the debit card, turn your cell off and go for a nice long walk when they walk in. He just bullies is just another name for abuse. You need to rethink your living situation.", "Every bit of this is red flags. Even if every *once* in a while he\u2019s nice, nothing makes up for calling you names and or picking on your physical appearance. From someone who knows, if they love you, and if your appearance has changed there\u2019s a time and place to talk kindly and communicate with each other. For them to call out this because they don\u2019t want to do work\u2026. Op this will go on forever unless you get out. Love, you sound sweet, don\u2019t let him dim your light and make you feel like less.", "NTA damn you are one woman act. Im exhausted just reading this. I guess I\u2019ll just be grateful being single.", "Leave this guy. Hes abusing you.", "Leave him", "Please.. if spouse won't listen to reason or get help, please throw the entire spouse away.. honey you can do every bit of this by yourself but with much less stress & anxiety! For him to be blatantly rude to you and allow his family to as well? Hell naw.. you're worth is much more than his little penny purse... \nNTA!", "NTA. Please move out. I don\u2019t say this very often as I think it\u2019s thrown around too easily but you need to look into a divorce. Please speak to an attorney and get yourself protected. He isn\u2019t a good man, you know he isn\u2019t. I hope things get better for you soon.", "NTA, kick this bum to the curb.", "NTA but your husband sounds like a huge loser, and you\u2019d be WAY better off without his dusty ass", "NTA it sounds like your husband is controlling and emotionally abusing you. I think it would be best for you to get out, you deserve better", "NTA\n\nI think you\u2019re finding out why this guy already has one ex-wife", "NTA\n\nBeing introverted doesn't mean you're autistic\n\nYou and partner should share chores equally if you're both working equally", "What are you getting out of this relationship? Because all I see is misery and aggravation. Do yourself a favor and lose the spouse. NTA", "Why are you with this guy? You seem like a servant, not a partner.", "This sounds like a case of actual legitimate gaslighting, with trying to convince her she's autistic.", "As someone who IS autistic... This has ZERO to do with autism, the husband and his family are playing the emotional abuse and gaslighting cards.\n\nSeriously OOP get out of that relationship sooner rather than later, your 'husband' has shown his true colors and from similar stories on reddit have shown, it RARELY if ever gets better.", "Mental break.\n\nCause. \n\nAte without Table.", "Why are you with him? What does he bring to the table?", "I understand where you're coming from with the word \"accusing\", but I read that as OP's husband calling her that in an accusing way, rather than OP saying that she thinks being autistic is something wrong to be accused of. He said it in an accusing way because he's ableist and judgemental. OP is just explaining to us what went down."]}
