Sweetie, go out and find new friends, these ones aren't it!", "NTA\n\nIt is basic common courtesy that you do not talk about parties/events in front of people who are not invited. Making the sole topic of conversation on an evolving out be about a trip one person isn\u2019t going on falls under that umbrella.

Your 'friends' sound like pricks, end of story. My question OP is why you have stayed friends with them for this long? Cut them off mate. Even if they assumed you didn't want to go or even knew you going to turn them down, they should have offered you to join regardless of your decision. NTA, not in the least. If you guys can't communicate about this issue and potentially fix it, and you choose to continue to be friends with them while this cycle continues. Then you're being an AH to yourself. Don't let yourself do that. Find better mates.", "Isn't the unspoken rule is that you don't talk about a trip in front of people who aren't invited?\nNTA", "NTA. Start broadening your friend group and drop them when you can do so.", "NTA. Those people aren\u2019t your friends.", "NTA.

It was rude of them to do that. Did they give a reason for not including you?", "NTA\n\nThey were being extremely rude. Best case scenario is they forgot you were there, which is still pretty mean.", "NTA, find friends that like and respect you. These people are appalling. You deserve so much more.", "NTA. They were rude of them and I\u2019m sure it was very hurtful.", "I was thinking this too. Like isn\u2019t this what you learn when planning smaller but more expensive birthday parties as a kid or if you can\u2019t invite everyone, don\u2019t mention it to others.", "Girl, I've been in your shoes.  Those friends never get better, and you'll always feel left out.  I found cutting those people out of your life is much better for your mental health.  I'd rather have no friends than friends that exclude me and make me feel bad.  And, in time, you'll find better friends who actually want you around and want to include you.", "They'd still need to use their words because they're the ones being vague then. If there is no clear invite, it puts the person present in an extremely awkward position of trying to determine if there is one.\n\nAnd if OP is not going but was invited, it's still considered rude to arrange a trip in front of her, especially at a setting like a club. That is excluding her- which would be why she felt left out in that case. It would be in very bad taste to do that, so I sincerely hope you don't think it's ok", "Lol \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I was with you until the end.

My sister and her daughter families take a vacation together every year. I am never invited because they know I can't afford it and they won't pay for me even though they could.

And they wonder why I leave so early.", "NTA I have had first hand experience with this and it is not fun.

From what I get out of your replies to comments in leaning more towards the YTA. but definitely, and contrary to the popular opinion here, your friends do not seem assholes.\n\nYou seem fine to stay quiet in the corner and listen to conversations when you go out with your friends, but this time you flipped out. Yes they could have invited you, and at the certain point they could have veered the conversation on another topic... However, you could have also stepped in the conversation with your friends and say that you'd wished to go too. \n\nAdditionally, they apologized but you got out on a Uber anyway.", "NTA. I think people have like a ten-second window with this stuff. And what I mean by that is that one of them slips up and starts talking about something you're not invited to, ten awkward seconds pass, they realize they're being jerks, and the conversation shifts to something else. People slip up sometimes. But this isn't a slip-up. These are just your \"friends\" being rude. I can guarantee they wouldn't like it if you invited two of them to something and spent the whole night talking about it while ignoring the other person.", "People who have never been left out of group activities have no idea how hurtful actions like this can be. That's why they have no idea.\n\nThat and they are complete dicks.", "It is not even being clueless. It is just plain rude.", "According to her other couple of posts, she just had a baby. So that is almost certainly the reason they didn't invite her.", "INFO: How are you connected to these people? They don't sound like your friends at all. Do they invite you out and then ignore you?", "NTA - I think if they invited you and you declined it would be different.", "NTA, this is one of my pet peeves.  It's happened to me many times, living in my ex's hometown.  I just couldn't believe how thoughtless and clueless people could be.", "NTA, but maybe one of them will drink the Mexican water and have some gastrointestinal karma for doing this to you.", "NTA, but you are incorrect about one thing. These people are not your friends. They may  not have intentionally been that rude, but they were at least really clueless. You deserve better friends who don't sit there actively excluding you for a period of time while you sit there awkwardly.\n\nI'm so sorry.", "NTA\n\nInstead of asking them not to discuss, say something like \u201coh, that sounds fun. I\u2019d love to join you\u201d. Their response will tell you whether you should call them friends or casual acquaintances.", "NTA. Y W B T A if you stayed in this group of people who obviously are not your friends!", "This isn\u2019t an AITA.\n\nYou justifiably confronted them. \n\nThey rightly apologized.\n\nThis conflict is settled.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, though, that they excluded you. That is shitty.", "NTA - time for new friends", "It sucks really. I remember hanging out with this group of girls who were supposed to be my \"friends\" but they never even talked to me and i was always in the sidelines. There was one time i wandered off for like half and hours and they didn't notice that i wasn't there.", "There may be a good reason, to be charitable.  But if there was, then before they went off into that degree of discussing it and planning it, they should have addressed that with OP first.  \"Oh hey, we don't want to leave you out, but we assumed you wouldn't be able to go --\" \n\n(Although, that works for the \"just had a baby\" reason mentioned below. It requires a lot more tact if the reason is finances.)", "INFO: If one of them is making plans for people to meet up, do they invite you? Or is it always you making the plans/a group chat that you're all in where one of them will say they want to do this and you all agree?", "So your operating theory for this post is that OP is intentionally lying?\n\nIf she \\*was\\* uninformally invited, according to her write-up here, she did not pick up on that and did not think she was.  And when she brought it up, the other should have said, oh, we thought you knew you were invited and that you weren't interested.  But they did not say that.\n\nOtherwise, it's not very useful to look at a straightforward AITA post like this and approach it as \"but what if OP isn't telling the truth?\"  Yeah, sometimes it's obvious that the OP is leaving out something important, or has slanted the write-up to make themselves look better.  This sub is pretty good at recognizing that and mentioning it.\n\nThis post doesn't give off those vibes.  So why bring up the theory?", "People really do not have manners these days. People typically try to have conversations that everyone in the group can participate in, there will always be side tangents but focusing an extended time on a topic that excludes people in the conversation circle is rude.", "NTA and these people are definitely NOT your friends.", "NTA - they were being rude", "Dude,  my \"friends\" did this to me all the time.  They didn't even care when I stopped talking to them.  My advice is to drop them if this is a pattern", "NTA, but they don\u2019t really seem like friends so maybe you should find others to be your friends.", "You need new friends.", "NTA. It's been done to me as well. You did the brave thing, leaving those fake friends.", "Listen, overall, I'm with you.  I think you are NTA, and they are.  And I agree with others here that you need to accept that they really are not \"friends\".  I know it's harder when you're an adult, but you can find better friends.\n\nI only wanted to note, in response to this particular comment -- they sound like they are very thoughtless.  They aren't good at the social skill of recognizing when their own behavior is off-putting or exclusionary towards someone else.  They're selfish.\n\nBut regarding \"they won't tell me who it is\" -- is it that they \"won't\", or that they really just never think of it?  Going by their behavior with the trip incident, it sounds like they are so self-absorbed that their awareness does not extend to thinking from someone else's perspective.  Again: thoughtless.\n\nThat does not absolve them, at all!  So what I'm going to say here is just for you to think over, and perhaps take with you into forming new relationships:\n\nSometimes, if you're sitting there, and other people start talking about someone you don't know -- you're going to have to ASK them who that is, rather than wait in silence for them to think to tell you.  They \\*should\\* think to tell you, but they won't always do so.  There is nothing wrong, if you are sitting right there, with inserting yourself into the conversation to ask who they're talking about and how they know them and so on.  \n\nThere are people who operate socially on the assumption that everyone will actively engage themselves in what's going on, and if they don't, they aren't interested for some reason. This is, to be clear, not a great thing to do.  Because there are other people whose social instincts are that it's polite to wait to be included / introduced / invited / explained-to.  And when these two types meet, the one who hangs back sits there waiting to be included, while the other type takes their hanging-back as voluntary disengagement (usually no-harm, no-foul).\n\nThere is something to be said for \"if you are interested and want to be included, put yourself forward\" and don't be a wallflower, don't wait for others to notice you and bring you in.\n\n(I still, personally, think that the best social etiquette is to have an awareness of others in the group, and try to be inclusive; to keep an eye out for whether the conversation or plans have left one person behind, and to stop and make sure to re-include them.  But, that's me, and there are a lot of people out there who do not even necessarily agree with that as a point of etiquette.  I'm a bit of an introvert myself, and also an anxious hostess, and that's why I see it from that viewpoint, most likely.)\n\nI do think THIS group is a loss and you should cut off that dead weight.  But the next time, consider leading a bit more.  They'll likely take it as you being interested in them, rather than you being rude.\n\n(All of this goes completely out the window if you really DID mean \"they will not tell me who they're talking about even if I ask\".  Which I guess is possible, because these women sound so self-absorbed as it is.)", "Did you try saying something like that sounds fun?\n\nThe thing I've learned is that people can be oblivious to the fact that people think they aren't being included in things or that something isn't an open invitation.\n\nI ended up not living with my friends one year in college because I thought they were all planning to live together without me so I found someone else to live with. Didn't find out for years that- no, the plan was for me to live with them and they picked someone else when I chose to live somewhere else.\n\nI could have said something. But I was so convinced that no one wanted me there, that it never occurred to me to ask."]}
