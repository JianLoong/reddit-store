Kinda sounds like your wife's annoyed that you brought up something she didn't want to be known or maybe has unresolved feelings about that time, other than a blanket apology can help you on that as I'm not neuro typical so I'd end up ignoring it as I wouldn't notice her problem or when I cottoned on to her being upset just point blank asking what the heck her problem is.", "I\u2019d say NAH because you meant to say it in a way that you\u2019re appreciative that you had rich parents because they allowed you to have him comfortably but it came out very badly", "Bruh!\n\nYou told your son he was almost an abortion. Yikes! Even if thats true, duuuuuuuuuudeeeee!!!\n\nYta.", "Wow. YTA. What a ridiculous thing to tell your child.", "YTA.  In fact, A doesn't begin to cover it.\n\nYou told your son that if he didn't have rich grandparents, his mother would have aborted him.  Of course you would have been able to bring a baby into the world, but you would have chosen to get rid of him instead.  What kind of \"perspective\" does that give him, exactly?\n\nIf I were your wife, I'd tell your kid that dad is lying, that maybe that's what dad thought at the time because he was very young and a jerk, but she wanted him desperately.  Then I'd leave with the kid and not look back.\n\nHow could you hurt your son like that?  Have you no shame?", "I thought I could come to your defense and be the only comment that didn't call you an @hole... But after reading it again, I have to say YTA \ud83d\ude06.\n\nI honestly have no issues with your remarks however there is zero reasons  in the context of this conversation for them to occur. You try deflecting that \"you got your wealth from your parents\" to \"it's cool right?\" Which back fired because your son called you out for being spoiled which brings up even more questions that your own child would say that \ud83d\udc40. Than you follow it up with \"well lucky for you I'm spoiled or I would of requested your abortion upon finding out!\" \n\nLike.. wait, what?", "YTA\u2026not because people implied you meant abortion (which you did because you had to talk to your parents at first and when you confirmed you\u2019d be set out of high school your wife changed her mind about not going through with it).\n\nYou are because rather than letting your son who is at an age to be a smartass, be a smartass, you decided to lecture him and give him the TRUTH about why he existed.\n\nYou couldn\u2019t let the kid have one up on you with his smart trade. You had to make sure to rub it in and act like a child.\n\n\u201cYea I had rich parents that helped me get a job\u2026but how do you think we provide for you and your kids? I\u2019m not rich but I know how to make the most of the money we have so you guys don\u2019t go without hints you need\n\nOr\n\n\u201cYup if I wasn\u2019t a master of finances you wouldn\u2019t have this game or consoles because I\u2019m not rich like grandma and grandpa who can buy anything\u201d\n\nNope you went\n\n\u201cYea if it weren\u2019t for them being rich we wouldn\u2019t have had you\u201d\u2026\n\nAnd guess what\u2026if he HASNT already figured it out, he will figure out that you guys had him very young and with the way society is, he will infer that your comments meant aborting him regardless of the \u201cwe would have given him up for adoption\u201d he now knows you didn\u2019t have him out of love for his mom and him\u2026you had him because it was financially convenient", "So you basically told your son you didn't want him but your parents paid you off to keep him. \n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nThere are subjects that are fair game in a friendly banter, and there are subjects that shouldn\u2019t be touched with a ten foot pole. This is a subject that he may or may not already be a little sensitive about. I know children whose parents have weaponized the circumstances of their birth, and it\u2019s greatly affected them. It\u2019s something that should not be joked about or thrown about carelessly, regardless of intent. \n\nStuff like that stays with kids. It doesn\u2019t matter how you said it or what you meant. \n\nIf I were you, I wouldn\u2019t try to explain myself. Don\u2019t dig the hole deeper.

It sounds to me like y\u2019all were just joking around, and you said that you\u2019re glad your parents are rich because it meant that you got to have your son, and you\u2019re grateful for that.", "Damn dude. Hard YTA. Why would you say something like that? Over a video game??", "YTA. You got outsmarted by your kid. Instead of being proud of that and encouraging of that you told him he might not have existed. Way to go father of the year you are the total AH.", "NTA.  I didn\u2019t interpret it that way either.  He obviously loves his child and is grateful to have him in his life.", "Wtf\u2026I had a mother who used to tell me she wished she had the abortion.

No kid wants to hear that it all came down to executive decision. The kid\u2019s too young to be all jocular about his existential vulnerability.", "NTA. Your son is pretty soft for a 16 year old boy.  My dad has been telling me he should have pulled out the night I was conceived since I was about that age\n\nI was born to young parents and they disclosed to me which family members suggested my mom have an abortion. I was old enough to hear it at the time (also HS aged) and it was sound advice at the time.  My dad made $10/hr and my mom was in college.  They had a really really hard fucking time early on.  Obviously I'm thankful it didn't happen, and so are all of those same people.\n\nYou told your son the truth in a joking way. He's old enough to hear it. He needs to realize that real life is deadly fucking serious.  Hopefully he doesn't have to make the same choices you guys did, but he doesn't have to actually be in the situation to think about what it would feel like. \n\nSince he's being emotional, you should probably talk to him about it and explain where you were coming from. It has nothing to do with who he is now or that you wish you had aborted him, etc.", "As a reader who has no clue what the 2k info was about (besides basketball?)

You should look at becoming a lawyer, it just might be your calling.", "Kid is obviously aware of his \"privilege\" and even calls the dad out for being snobby or spoiled inferred by the remark it's not cool to have rich parents because you got everything you ever wanted.\n\nThink that speaks volumes and poses even more questions about the relationship dynamic. There were zero reasons for expressing to his child that he would have been aborted if it were not for him being a spoiled brat. It's just out of context and makes no sense, it's like they were having two different conversations.", "Literally I\u2019m so confused where people are getting that he\u2019s mad about the game", "How is that close to what he said????? Y\u2019all have no reading comprehension on this post I swear", "\ud83e\udd14 yeah probably a few on that abortion comment... But if you actually apply reading comprehension like you suggested. You would realize the dad's remarks are out of context and seem like a low blow versus a \"learning moment\".\n\nThere is no validation for saying yeah you're lucky I'm a spoiled brat otherwise you would have never been conceived. The fact his kiddo said it's not cool to have parents who have money and give him (dad) everything he ever wanted, should fill in a lot of the blanks that we don't know about their relationship. Which is probably exactly why the kid took it the way he did and is pissed off.", "Personally I think OP was actually more upset that his son just called him out for being a spoiled brat. I still can't wrap my head around the fact the kiddo said it's not cool that grandma and grandpa are rich because you got everything you ever wanted (to the dad). To me...

Given the context of talking about pregnancy and choices I would agree that telling your child that tid bit would not make one an a h. That\u2019s an informative discussion and one that provides insight into hard life choices. Outside of that discussion (and in the middle of a game the dad lost, and the kid gently ribbed him for having rich parents) it\u2019s petty and strange placed. I can\u2019t imagine saying something like that to my teen out of nowhere. They are sensitive even when they are trying to keep their tough exterior and that could really hurt their feelings.

I don't think what you said was you trying to be  malicious and understand your point. You gave the back story and this matter came up in conversation. It was a matter of fact and the truth. You cannot be mad at what is the truth and facts.
