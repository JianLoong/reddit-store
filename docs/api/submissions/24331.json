The parent incurring expense has 30 days to send the bill to the other party and request reimbursement. Upon receipt of that bill, the obligated parent had 30 days to reimburse. If not paid, it is contempt of court. If you don\u2019t have that provision, you might want to explore incorporating it into the prior court agreement by court order.

I understand being frustrated when financial things in the custody agreement aren\u2019t followed by the coparent. I\u2019m a woman married to a man who coparents his child with the child\u2019s biomom. We have more than 50% custody and end up paying for a lot of expenses that our court agreement says biomom is supposed to pay for, all while monthly child support amount is paid by my husband. So yes, the OP has every right to be frustrated with their coparent, and if they\u2019re not paying for things they\u2019re supposed to then take them back to court to ask for a modification. Maybe the courts will give OP more custody, maybe require a child support amount to be automatically withdrawn from the coparents checks each month if they can\u2019t handle buying things they\u2019re supposed to. But the way OP is phrasing things makes it sound like they\u2019re prepared to let their child suffer because of the coparents failings and that makes them the AH.", "Both are the mother.   Both are female", "That wasn't in the original edit, but my stance is the same.", "OP just sarcastically told ex to get a second job.

Why is that her problem?", "It\u2019s not about the OP or the ex, it\u2019s about what is best for the kid.  Some people really just should not be parents.\n\nShe\u2019s not backing out of anything and the OP is voluntarily paying for something that is not necessary.  IMO she\u2019s using this choice to get out of paying for any of her kid\u2019s other needs, which is gross.  Things change and the cost of living now compared to when they made this deal is vastly different.  It\u2019s ridiculous to ignore that fact and even more so to blame the ex for it.  If money is real issue and the OP doesn\u2019t want to pay for the optional private school and help with his actual needs then she can send him to public school to use that money to help with his actual needs.  \n\nI hope the ex asks for a modification on the agreement if she needs the help.", "Her options here are to either pull your son out of extra curriculars (bad for him) or spend less time and energy on him due to an extra job/hours (also bad for him).

That's a great idea. Really helpful to expose your kid to that kind of social ostracism.   \n\nEarning less than OP doesn't mean the ex falls short as a mom, I think that's a vile world view. One's earning potential can always change.  \n\nAlso, personally I think this bleating about a second job is disingenuous and mean-spirited.  \nWhen I was a teen, my mother commuted to work from 07.25 h \nto 18.38 h from Monday to Friday. We had 10 min on the bus in the morning together before she got on the train, and we had the evening when her bus came in about half an hour after mine.

When should/could she have gotten a second job without abandoning me?  \n\nIf both parents together can't work out how to send their kid to this school in a dignified and bearable way, that's also healthy emotionally for the kid, the school is too expensive. That OP can pay her part as determined before the cost of the school changed, doesn't mean it isn't. This agreement isn't some immutable natural law, nor a heavenly decree : they can and should change it as needed. What if they discover the son is gifted in an area the school doesn't specialize in?
