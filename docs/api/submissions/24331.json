She made a deal, she needs to uphold it, end of story. Now, if the kid is going to go without, then I'd say you should chip in (assuming as it sounds that you are able to afford it easily) but you made it sound like she *can* afford it, it's just gonna be rough for a while, if that's the case than she can suffer through like the rest of us.", "NTA. You are doing what you need to do. It\u2019s your ex\u2019s responsibility to cover that cost. \n\nYou could offer to aid and provide some additional support if she signs a contract to pay you back but that is not required. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate your son is caught in the middle, but that is life sometimes.", "NTA", "YTA. Spite is more important to you than being a good parent.", "YTA. This is a horrible and petty example to set for your son.", "US attorney here, not your attorney. I have no knowledge of the specifics of the agreement. Generally, in my state their are included provisions in the custody agreement that if a parent pays in the entirety for an obligation, whether not their responsibility or expense divide, there is a 30/30 provision. The parent incurring expense has 30 days to send the bill to the other party and request reimbursement. Upon receipt of that bill, the obligated parent had 30 days to reimburse. If not paid, it is contempt of court. If you don\u2019t have that provision, you might want to explore incorporating it into the prior court agreement by court order. This puts the child first, and gives the concerned parent a route to reimbursement if they decide to pay instead. Just a thought.", "YTA\n\nThis isn\u2019t about you trying to teach any lesson.  It\u2019s quite clearly you just wanting to stick it to your ex and it will be at your son\u2019s expense.  That\u2019s the lesson he\u2019ll end up learning. He\u2019s going to learn that you cared more about what a piece of paper says than making sure he was taken care of to the best of your ability.  You son doesn\u2019t have to go to private school. He does have to have things like clothes and supplies.  Cost of living increases are not controlled by your ex either so this whole narrative that you are somehow a victim of having to pay the lion\u2019s share of an expense you voluntarily pay for is ridiculous.  If it\u2019s too much send him to public school and split the cost of everything else. \n\nBtw your attitude and behavior makes YTA whether you are a man or a woman but kudos to you for using the assumption that you were a man to spark and fueling the woe the hardships of being a man narrative.  I\u2019m sure that was totally an accident.", "Even if you were a man, it's 2023, so the idea that men should give more because of their chromosomal makeup is antiquated and insulting. \n\nYou made an agreement that favored her previously. Now things have shifted and she's not happy about. Tough noodles. You're NTA. A deal is a deal.\n\nJust to get a few digs in, you should ask for her help with tuition after inflation goes down.", "NTA.\n\n> You all can stop assuming that I am.a man and should give everything to my ex.\n\nBut in 2023, it is amazing how folks assume that!", "YTA YTA YTA. So trying to stick it to your ex? Great job well done and in the process really the only one who is getting hurt is the kiddo. So you are ok hurting the kiddo? You suck and are an asshole (regardless of gender). This is your kid and you need to take care of him.", "Nta", "I think the question is whether she can afford it or is taking advantage.\n\nIf she is genuinely struggling then put the kid first. It's about him at the end of the day, not her. \n\nNTA for wanting to be fair and you are already shouldering a bigger burden of cost. But sometimes it is necessary for one parent to do more even if it sticks in your throat a bit.", "NTA- What you are doing is making her be accountable and responsible for things she agreed on. She is the one hurting your son if she is not willing to do what she has to do to get the things he needs that she has agreed to handle. Doesn't she have family and friends that can help if she can't do it alone.", "Exactly. You need to be careful here, because at the end of the day, your kid needs to have what he needs to be in school. Even while you take this on with your ex, you need to make sure that he's having what he needs to complete his assignments, is dressed safely for the weather, etc, and keep an eye out on how this is impacting him (getting bullied for not dressing a certain way, losing friends because of not being able to participate in extracurriculars). \n\n  \nMy parents were divorced, and my dad chose to cover my dental bill and leave my healthcare bill to my mom. But even if he was behind on payment, my mom made sure I could still go to the dentist. \n\n  \nIt absolutely shouldn't be your responsibility. It's not your fault that inflation is happening, and it's not your fault that her part of the agreement is getting hit harder than yours. But you have to weigh your attempts to abide by the divorce agreement with impact on your son. Which sucks, because you lose leverage if you're not willing to go all the way. But if you let this impact him, it becomes an e v e r y b o d y s u c k s situation.", "Because this is not about the ex its about the kid. She seems to only care about sticking it to her and not what the kiddo needs.", "The kid also doesn\u2019t need to go to private school so if the OP can\u2019t afford to help their ex then they can send their kid to public school and use the money to pay for his needs.  Interesting though that the only sacrifice that should be made are ones that effect the kid when he\u2019s with the ex though, isn\u2019t it?", "Not even a matter of happiness, but basic needs. Op is definitely the ah", "Jesus Christ. It should be telling that everyone here assumes you're a resentful ex-husband because they can't even conceive of a child's mother behaving like this.
