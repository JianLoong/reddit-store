For over 36 years, we had a smaller refrigerator in our home because of the space limitation where it was and it had an ice maker but this refrigerator is incredible!", "We bought wire baskets for ours and the put a white board behind it with a diagram showing what is in each bin.  Ours is a chest style.", "Ah, good idea. I gotta find where they sell that stuff near me. I need a new fridge and washing machine soon. I'd like something a little fancy but not at a fancy price. I absolutely don't care if there's superficial damage like a scratch as long as the thing works the way it's supposed to.", "I don't think they have those where I live. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe do have an outlet place that knocks 10-20% off sticker price for damaged stuff, but it is older stuff that you can usually buy on their website new for less.", "How do you find such a place? \ud83d\udc40 We may be in need of new appliances soon and you can bet your ass I don't want to pay full price.", "Sounds like you don\u2019t have an ice dispenser", "And as the icing (pun intended) on the cake: he was still wrong.", "Apart from watering down the drink if you don\u2019t drink it fast enough, it also takes up loads of space, so you have way less of your actual drink, and it hurts the teeth unless you drink with a straw at all times", "This is gigantic YTA. I get what you\u2019re saying about compromise, and like literally all of this could be resolved by a conversation. \u201cHey, your drinks take up a lot of space. Do you mind keeping fewer in the fridge at a time and storing the rest in the pantry?\u201d But instead of saying that, OP was a petty baby. So that doesn\u2019t make OP a soft YTA because there exists a solution; OP never used the solution that exists and was an AH instead.", "Lmao I imagined Boa Hancock from One Piece sticking her face high up and backwards in the air just to look down at someone when reading this", "I think it\u2019s petty. But honestly more controlling. \nMaking her do what you want her to do, bc u want her to do it. That shows lack of respect for your partner and their preferences. Not a good start to relationship u want to be in forever. YTA big time", "Also ice cube trays are a thing, you don\u2019t need a fridge with a dispenser to have ice.", "It\u2019s\u2026. Not even a pricy fridge? Ice makers don\u2019t automatically mean a $4k fridge. You can get one with it for under $1k. He\u2019s probably just a kid who thinks anything costing adult money is super expensive. When I was that age I thought $1k was super expensive too, but as far as appliances go, it\u2019s just \u201cbetter than the cheapo brand that breaks in a few years\u201d. People on Reddit are weird sometimes. It\u2019s like they forget that it\u2019s okay to get nice things.", "We need more info. If she's stashing so many drinks in the fridge that they can't for groceries, while he might be petty, she is being inconsiderate.", "I don\u2019t really have an opinion what the fridge his parents brought him but his actions and comments say a lot. \u201cI took out all her drinks so she will have to use the ice cube dispenser now if she wants a cold drink\u201d. He took out \u201call\u201d the drink to make a point.", "He must have spent days/weeks thinking about revenge. In addition to being stupid and immature, it seems he's not that smart!", "Yeah when I first read this I read it as like 10 cups in the fridge that he\u2019s scared to knock over and the comments are all confusing. If it\u2019s like one then yeah makes sense why hes an asshole but if you can\u2019t put groceries away maybe a different solution is required.", "Belgium is 50/50 on fridge, freezer AND stove. Some have like just the cupboards and an extraction fan. The rest is for the renter. Others have a hyper installed  kitchen with all the bells.", "Avatar is so mid", "We felt the same way in 2009 when we discovered the freezer had an ice maker AND a light.  Livin large here, lol \ud83d\ude02", "I think I went out with him too.", "My daughter has one and hates it. It's harder to organize stuff in it and every time she gets groceries she has to reorganize everything in the whole freezer. I have the old school type fridge with just the freezer on top with an ice maker in one corner of the freezer. My freezer actually holds more than hers.", "That part. I hate having to dig around to find stuff as well.", "My husband works in appliances and just brought home a separate ice maker.  I\u2019m excited lol"]}
