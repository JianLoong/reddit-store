Ice kills the taste.", "I've honestly never seen one so wouldn't know haha I'm \"ice tray that you freeze blocks in\" poor like a regular person.", "Also if you're like me and you're super sensitive to taste, the ice in the ice dispensers taste \"stale\" (forgive me for my lack of adjectives). \n\nI like using covered ice trays (bonus: pretty shapes AND I can add random edible flowers in the tray)", "And they tend to break down. I won\u2019t have one.", "I definitely think he\u2019s being petty, but I\u2019m also wondering how wasteful they\u2019re being when there\u2019s not enough room for food and drinks for 2 people in a brand new fridge. Either you guys need to organize your fridge better or meal plan a bit ahead so you\u2019re not letting a bunch of stuff sit there and rot. I can\u2019t imagine a scenario where a weeks worth of groceries for 2 people would require an entire fridge. I\u2019m assuming American sized as there\u2019s an ice maker.", "Going to play devils advocate here. Not saying he\u2019s not TA, but I have a fridge with an ice maker and it takes up no extra space. Even if it did there would still be a lot of room in the fridge, how many drinks is she keeping in there?", "IKR\n\nThe fridge in my condo is tiny. It's one of those top/bottom freezer/refrigerators so it doesn't have a door dispenser, but it does have an ice maker that takes up a  good third of the freezer space. \n\nI turned off the ice maker and took the tray out so I have room for, like, food. I got a little silicon ice tray to make ice in. \n\nAnyway, OP is the asshole. Cold drinks and warm drinks with ice are not equivalent, and OP shouldn't be forcing his preferences on his girlfriend. If she's using too much room in the fridge with her drinks, he can address *that. Politely.* (\"Could we agree not to put more than six drinks in the freezer to cool? There's not enough room for the dairy products. Six bottles are plenty for one day, and we can replenish each night.\")", "Room temp, man, it's what it's all about.", "he took them all out to *make*  her use the ice. Twas on purpose.", "I mean its not that much for a middle class. Unless you are comparing it to the absolute cheapest Fridge freezers.", "But the fact that she doesn't use it also doesn't affect him. Why does she have to do things his way? Even if he was making room in the fridge, there's no reason he couldn't have left a few of her drinks in there so she'd have cold drinks without using the ice. He is acting like an asshole.", "Taking all of her drinks out of the fridge is petty and disrespectful. Sure, not having a cold drink isn't a big deal. But it's not about the drink. It's about having a partner who intentionally inconveniences you and disregards your feelings. That's the issue, and what makes OP the AH", "You do realize you can just buy an ice tray, right? It isn't necessary for your fridge to have an ice dispenser for you to have ice for your beverages.", "So because you have space they must have space? There's no logic behind that but okay..", "So your suggestion is they remove that or...?", "Those are viewpoints i made in my comment on the post. But ultimately it sounds like theyre both being petty instead of communicating  or compromising. It sounds  like they both  grew up differently  and  ultimately  the pettiness  will break them apart  or theyll lead petty lives.", "I mean she didnt drop it if she still complains about the ice maker and doesnt use it and fills the fridge with all her drinks instead of a few.

Can say where you are but still don't answer what the point you were making actually was. Probably because you weren't making a point. You were just mad she was correct in what she said.

Admit it and learn from it or don't be surprised when she returns the favour.", "That kinda makes it extra weird that you're obsessed with an ice maker, ngl.", "Yeah, I read \"more expensive fridge with an ice maker\" to mean \"fridge with built in door ice dispenser\", and those are not something you can just clear for fridge space.", "While technically true it is practically irrelevant.

Bourbon? Well that depends on what it is and where it's from.", "yes, but no. \n\nA little bit of water actually changes the flavors nicely (releases some of the oils) but you don't want the cubes to fully melt because it'll water it down. \n\nThis is why large ice cubes exist.", "We have one and it basically means 3 of the 6 shelves in our freezer (American style with a full height narrow freezer) are half shelves.", "We bought our house in 2019 and it came with a fridge with an ice dispenser.

Larger cubes or spheres made out of filtered or distilled water are best. They melt slower and chill at a smaller rate. You don\u2019t want whiskey and ice water if you\u2019re going for taste because the temperature can affect how you perceive the taste. So, like, I wouldn\u2019t put it 1:1 with water and then put it over ice, unless I was treating it like a highball cocktail and not like a sipping whiskey. \n\nIce can pretty easily take on other flavors, though, and then they\u2019ll get into your whiskey as the ice melts and you don\u2019t want that. Smaller cubes with a higher surface area : volume ratio or wet cubes that are already melting will over-dilute it more easily than hard ice, too.\n\nThere is a balance point, and for me it\u2019s way before the 1:1 ratio. 10-20% dilution depending on how high the proof starts at (higher proofs coil the flavor elements up and they need to be relaxed) or a challenging or difficult whisky (like a super peaty scotch).", "Good ice won\u2019t get it that cold very quickly. That\u2019s why you see people using larger format ice with a tiny surface area : volume ratio. Slow melt, slow steady chill and dilution. \n\nWhiskey with ice water is a cocktail, not whiskey. And you absolutely can enjoy the flavor of whiskey in the world\u2019s most popular whiskey cocktail. \n\nBut if you\u2019re adding so much ice that it\u2019s muting the flavor of your drink, you\u2019re 2/3 of the way to a cocktail anyway.

They seem like they'd be amazing but I cannot stand the way I need to re-organize my freezer every time we go grocery shopping", "I don't think I've seen a fridge of that caliber without an ice dispenser.  Only ones I've seen are the cheaper fridges where you can add an ice dispenser later on.", "I got one of those and I love it!  I can't hook up water to it, so I definitely didn't want one with a door dispenser taking up that extra space - it was annoying how limited those options are!

So we have a container for chicken/turkey, a few for venison/beef, one for prepped meals, one for veggies, etc. Makes it a lot easier.

The only one I've seen is the one my parents had, but they moved to a rental and left it, so I haven't seen one in multiple years.

Guess I\u2019ve spent the last decade and a half making, selling, serving, collecting, and educating people on something I don\u2019t like or appreciate?\n\nThanks for letting me know. Next time one of the best American Whiskey head distillers in the country comes in and orders an egg white whiskey sour with his limited edition rye, I\u2019ll tell him we don\u2019t do cocktails anymore.\n\nEdit: for the record, nobody who makes whiskey wants you to gatekeep any whiskey, much less their whiskey. We want people not just drinking it but also enjoying it. And for some people, enjoying whiskey means putting it in a cocktail.

My husband is going to LOVE going to find freezer containers lol", "Worked 10 years selling liquor on/off premise. Favorite part of the job was meeting the guys who had hands on everything made.
