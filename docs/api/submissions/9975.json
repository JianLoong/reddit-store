You know what it feels like to have someone make a rude comment about your appearance. She did it as an immature high school kid. You did it as an *adult.*\n\nAll you had to say was that you did remember her, that you remembered how rude she was, and that you're not interested in catching up. \n\nI understand that it can feel gratifying to clap back at a bully.

You're all adults now right? Surely you can all move on from petty high-school drama, even be friends if it goes well.\n\nStill, you're not required to interact with someone, even if your reasons are quite petty.

You were responding to the comments of a hormone-crazy underage child who doesn't exist anymore, and ended up sounding like one yourself.
