I could tell she was upset by my response. We then continued to talk about how it would be really expensive for her and she has no one else to watch her kids. For some background my sister and her husband I both work full time jobs. His family lives 40 minutes away and are not able to watch their kids. My sister and my other older sister had kids when I was around 11 or 12 so I am no stranger to babysitting or watching their kids. I do not like to babysit or watch children. I do not enjoy it at all despite them being my nephews and nieces. I absolutely love my niece and nephews and I have watched them before, but 5 days a week for 2\u20133 months for 9 hours a day is not something I want to do. I called my room to ask if I was in the wrong and she said that I said \u201cno\u201d and that\u2019s that. However ever since my sisters had their kids and I\u2019ve said no to something related to helping them with their kids I\u2019ve always gotten the same remark that \u201cyou\u2019re going to have kids one day and need someone to watch them too\u201d my sister and mom both reminded me of this on the phone by the way.

The compensation she's offering is quite honestly insulting.", "NTA. You are not free or low cost daycare for family members. The correct response here is to find out what the going rate is for a full time nanny in your area (since that\u2019s what your sister is looking for) and offer to do it at that rate.

Your sister should have looked into affordable childcare before they decided to move to that city.  She needs to make the choice between paying for childcare, reducing her work hours, have her husband reduce his work hours, or trying to adjust work hours between her and her husband in order to cover caring for their children.\n\nAsking you to be a back-up babysitter if they hired a nanny/daycare and couldn't get service (daycare closed for the day, nanny gets sick) would be appropriate.  But asking you to be their full-time child care provider when you don't like taking care of children is ridiculous.", "NTA. Ya know how many people said they'd be, \"... more than happy to take the little one once he's here!!!\" \n\nI call Malarkey, Good Madam. \n\nMy kid is 7. We lived out of state from my mom for 6 years.  Lots of friends 'offered'.

She has helped. But uh... yeah. All those offers from my pregnancy. So far 1 friend came and spent a couple hours with kiddo. And I am so grateful! They had a blast. But, promised sentiments mean nothing. \n\nThe reason daycare costs thats much especially in the summer is thats their busiest time of the year. They literally keep dozens kf kkds alive 13 hours a day, provide cleanliness, food and whatever else ALL the kids need. \n\nWhatever sister would pay, would be pennies compared to nor al childcare, because thats the price of childcare \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nObvi a different perspective.

You get to decide whether you want to do that or not and you don't so your mom is right, you said no and that is that.

What would she have done if you hadn\u2019t moved to the same city, not had the kids? Doubt it.

My mother (before I stopped speaking to her) used to say the same thing to me, because she had my brother and sister when I was 11ish. She said we'd repay eachother because that's what family does.

She never once spent time with them.", "NTA\n\nNo is a perfectly acceptable answer to any question. If no isn't acceptable, it wasn't a qustion, it was a demand. Why would your sister feel comfortable demanding that you provide cheap or free child care for her children?\n\nChildcare is expensive because it is hard work -even if she was offering you the market rate of 1300 dollars a month, it would still be okay to say no. Your sister expects you to provide free or reduced price childcare and got upset when you declined? She doesn't sound like she has her children's best interest in mind. An underpaid, unwilling, unintersted babysitter isn't likely to provide a resonable level of care.", "No, NTA, and why would your sister want you to watch her kids if that is not something you wanted to do.  When people choose to have kids, the kids are their responsibility and nobody else's.  I do not understand why this seems to be difficult for so many parents to accept.  Just because you are family does NOT entitle your sister to choose how you spend your time.  Further, she states the reason she wants to have you babysit is so that she will NOT have to pay you as much as she would pay any other person on the planet hired to do that.  This is absolutely unfair and insulting.  She's not asking you to occasionally for a few hours a week watch her kids so she can run an errand.  She is asking you to undertake a full-time job at a reduced rate just because you are related.  If you asked her to do the same, would she?  Doubtful.", "NTA she should have thought about her arrangements before having them. It\u2019s also disrespectful to offer you such a low rate for 2 children for a continuous 9 hours, 5 days a week. Don\u2019t let them guilt trip you into doing something you\u2019re unhappy doing.", "NTA. \n\nJust to clarify, does she expect you to babysit 9 hours a day 5 days a week for months for free? \n\nLooking after kids is a full time job, and if you don\u2019t want to commit to that, you don\u2019t have to nor should you be expected to just because you\u2019re \u201cnot doing anything\u201d \n\n \u2018I said no and that\u2019s that\u2019 - exactly this.", "NTA!!", "NTA. that is a full time nanny or daycare job, and that is who she should find to watch her young kids. you are under no obligation to give up months of your life because she decided to have children, and it is insane for them to try to guilt you into it.", "Nta \n\nYou know how much work that would be for you? Is she is going to be paying for their food? It\u2019s their summer. The kids are going to be expecting you to entertain them. I love how she just expected you to watch them and then get mad when you said no. You are 20 years old. You are young. You should be enjoying your life and having a fun summer. Go have fun! Go out with your friends. Go do some summer stuff.", "NTA she clearly started out trying to guilt and undermine you and asked very rudely. What a winning strategy. /s", "$1300 a month for both kids? That\u2019s a steal.\n\nI would never ask this of my younger sisters. Especially a whole summer for free? I feel bad asking them to babysit every once in a while. My mom is helping with childcare while I work and finish school this semester, but she also lives in my house rent/utilities-free. Even then, I\u2019m eternally grateful and don\u2019t act like I\u2019m entitled to her time. \n\nYour sister is not entitled to your time.", "NTA\n\nThis is a case of entitled parents.. A breed of people I absolutely hate. \n\nJust because you're family doesn't mean you're free childcare services whenever someone else needs them. \n\nGetting a babysitter / daycare is expensive, but that's what she signed up for when she had two kids?
