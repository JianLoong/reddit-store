Your sister should have looked into affordable childcare before they decided to move to that city.  She needs to make the choice between paying for childcare, reducing her work hours, have her husband reduce his work hours, or trying to adjust work hours between her and her husband in order to cover caring for their children.\n\nAsking you to be a back-up babysitter if they hired a nanny/daycare and couldn't get service (daycare closed for the day, nanny gets sick) would be appropriate.  But asking you to be their full-time child care provider when you don't like taking care of children is ridiculous.", "NTA.

Why would your sister feel comfortable demanding that you provide cheap or free child care for her children?\n\nChildcare is expensive because it is hard work -even if she was offering you the market rate of 1300 dollars a month, it would still be okay to say no. Your sister expects you to provide free or reduced price childcare and got upset when you declined? She doesn't sound like she has her children's best interest in mind. An underpaid, unwilling, unintersted babysitter isn't likely to provide a resonable level of care.", "No, NTA, and why would your sister want you to watch her kids if that is not something you wanted to do.  When people choose to have kids, the kids are their responsibility and nobody else's.  I do not understand why this seems to be difficult for so many parents to accept.  Just because you are family does NOT entitle your sister to choose how you spend your time.  Further, she states the reason she wants to have you babysit is so that she will NOT have to pay you as much as she would pay any other person on the planet hired to do that.  This is absolutely unfair and insulting.  She's not asking you to occasionally for a few hours a week watch her kids so she can run an errand.  She is asking you to undertake a full-time job at a reduced rate just because you are related.  If you asked her to do the same, would she?  Doubtful.", "NTA she should have thought about her arrangements before having them. It\u2019s also disrespectful to offer you such a low rate for 2 children for a continuous 9 hours, 5 days a week.

Is she is going to be paying for their food? It\u2019s their summer. The kids are going to be expecting you to entertain them.

That\u2019s a steal.\n\nI would never ask this of my younger sisters. Especially a whole summer for free? I feel bad asking them to babysit every once in a while.

A breed of people I absolutely hate. \n\nJust because you're family doesn't mean you're free childcare services whenever someone else needs them. \n\nGetting a babysitter / daycare is expensive, but that's what she signed up for when she had two kids?

When this happens to you...\"", "LOL people who use \"family helps family\" line are ALWAYS the ones asking for help.  \n\nWatching two young kids full time is a little more than \"inconvenient\".", "Are you joking? Saying that $600 *per month* is an okay offer? For a 30-day month that breaks down to $1.25 an hour per child. I would consider that to be a *MASSIVELY* insulting \"offer\" family or not. \n\nOP, you are NTA for saying NO.\n\nEdit for spelling", "Do you honestly think there will be a time when this sister is free for the summer to be able to return this huge favor?\n\nWatching kids for a day or two here or there is one thing, an entire summer is another.", "Counteroffer with $2k/month and only go higher when she goes lower", "What's crazy is 1300 a month isn't even as expensive as it could be. \n\n300 a week for  watching children M-F for 8 hours isn't that bad.\n\nOP would literally make nothing if she agreeded to help. Sister really is looking for free child care", "Exactly what I was thinking! Still trying to convince OP it's for family lol.", "Seriously, 1300 for two kids...not bad. Which shows you how much it costs where I live!", "NAH. There is nothing wrong with her asking, and there is nothing wring with you saying no. As long as you don't expect her to help you with anything in the future, and she doesn't continue to badger you about this, then you're both all good.", "NTA.  You are not free/low cost labor.  You don't enjoy it.  The answer is no.  Your sister can be disappointed but that's it.", "NTA. How do they know you're going to have kids?. Having to be an unwilling babysitter for your older siblings may have made you decide not to have kids at all.", "NTA, but I'd offer to do it for 1250/month per child", "NTA. Your sister has some nerve.", "NTA. They should have figured out childcare before they had kids.", "Don't do it.  This will extend past the summer if you don't have a job by then.  You will be expected to do after care when the kids get out of school.  Then if you do get a job, you'll be guilted into not taking it, because \"who will look after my kids?\".  And you will become the de facto child care option for every occasion.  NTA.", "YMCA camp is cheap. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  It's a difference between watching the children for a few hours and watching them the whole summer for, \"5 days a week for 2\u20133 months for 9 hours a day\".  Hell, that's not watching or babysitting, that's a damn job.  To help out, maybe, you can offer one to two days a week, but no way would I commit for the whole three months every day.  If she can't accept that, well, two drops in a bucket and \\*\\*\\*\\* it.", "Nta who calls someone up and asks for a favor while being condescending??  Someone who wants told no.\n\nThere's a difference between occasionally babysitting for a date night and committing to an entire summer.", "NTA.\n\nmy wife got the same threats about when we had kids, so she fought with me about saying no to her siblings.  i warned her that there's no guarantee we'd get help.\n\nGuess what?  They're \"too busy\" now to help out with childcare! Their kids have too many activities, or its too far to drive where we live.\n\nFunny how that works", "How is that even rellevant?", "I have 3 kids and I don\u2019t want to watch them for the summer!

Helping out \"family' is not watching 2 kids for 45 hrs a week for 3 months for $600 a month!! That is $75 per week per kid! $25 a day!! I make more than that per hour!!

If that's the case they yeah, sure Sis is the AH.", "That was exactly my point. The children are elementary school age. This isn't the first time that OP's sister has had to figure out summer child care. Sister just saw a way to save some money by taking advantage of OP. She managed somehow before OP moved there.", "And if OP is babysitting at her sister's house, her sister will get mad if she comes home to a sink full of dishes or toys all over the living room, so it will turn into babysitting plus housecleaning.", "[deleted]", "I'm sure they can discuss that. \n\nIdk man, $1300 per month for 3 months is $4000 and that's just a lot of money. Like i said previously, of the sister is rich sure she's an asshole but most people will want to not spend that kind of money.", "Let's be the one who did the math !\n\nWe have 31 days per month (as it's July/August I assume we're talking about), let's say 8 hours per day, and 2 kids...\n\nThis comes back as 5.24$/h, so 2.62$ per hour and per child. We can also say 41.94$ per day, and we didn't even mention who carries the kids to and from OP's place, who is responsible for feeding them, would there be additional money to take them somewhere (gas, then maybe fees such as zoo, cinema, ice cream...)\n\nAnd just to laugh a little, if in fact the goal is for OP to take them full-time, it then amounts to 0.87$ per hour and per child. \n\n(And hello Rslash if you come here, love your videos, thought about you writing this as you love doing the math haha)", "I used to pay $2500 biweekly for 3 kids childcare, I wish it was only $1300/month..", "You make a good point about $1300 per month/child being a lot of money because it is. It is also very true that many people cannot afford these high prices, so they need to find a lower cost alternative. \n\nHowever, $600 a month for *two children* is flat-out insulting. I don't know where OP is located, so I Googled for my area. The going rate per child over the age of 2 years is $674 a month. That means $1,348 for 2 children per month.\n\nIf and *only IF* OP wanted to babysit these children, I wouldn't suggest that she do it for less than $450 a month per child. It would be cheaper on the sister than professional daycare, but $900 total per month is a slightly less insulting amount.", "It\u2019s a lot of money to spend. It\u2019s not a lot of money to earn (not that it was offered to OP).  Did the sister not know her children would need care over the summer?", "This is riddiculous. If you cannot afford it, don't go around breeding children and then expect \"family\" to take care of your duties. \n\nWhat sister is offering is a full time responsible job and offers way bellow minimum wage. This \"wage\" also includes offering food, snacks, increased utilities, stress, the risk of kids getting hurt, always keeping them occupied, etc.\n\nThis has nothing to do with being rich or not. This is about throwing your responsabilities onto other under disguise \"but family\".", "I was thinking it's probably for day camps.", "It\u2019s unlikely it\u2019s on the weekends. \n\nIt\u2019s more likely 22ish days a month.", "Maybe she knows maybe she doesn't but that doesn't mean she can afford it. Man is everyone here really that rich that they can pay $4000 for 3 months of daycare that easily without thinking of alternatives. If OP's sister can afford to pay that money easily then sure she's AH for asking OP at such a cheap price. But if she can't OP is definitely in a very grey area for rejecting to help.", "OP is not in a grey area for not agreeing to this extremely unreasonable ask.  Now if sister arranged for four day a week childcare to save money, and asked OP to cover one day a week that might be more reasonable. Asking OP to cover one or two weeks might also be more reasonable.  OP still wouldn\u2019t an an AH for saying no, but sister wouldn\u2019t be out of line for asking.  What else has sister done to try to solve this problem, because I\u2019m not seeing other alternatives she\u2019s considered.", "NTA.  Having kids is a decision that impacts a person's life, including their career, and adds financial and parental responsibilities.  This can be handled in different ways, including paying for daycare, not working, working less, dividing responsibilities between the mother and the father, etc.  Your sister and her husband need to figure out how they want to handle it.  If you want to do it, you should give them a quote with a high $ amount that makes this worth your time and effort, and require advance payment every month.  If this was my sister, my cost will be much higher than the daycare.", "NTA. I have 5 kids. 19 niblings. I do not babysit ever.  I hate babysitting. I never ask my siblings to babysit either. That\u2019s the cost of having kids.  Daycare. No one should ever assume family wants to help. My youngest is now 10. We just get up and go when we want. I have always worked part time to be available for the kids.  It\u2019s a sacrifice my husband and I made.  Less money but I\u2019m here. Kids are no one\u2019s responsibility but the parents.  They can ask. But they have to accept the word no.", "NTA.  \u201cNo\u201d is a complete sentence.  \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to\u201d is the best reason there is to not do something.

Uh, no. She's still going to have a full time job and won't help you at all. Plus you could decide to never have kids. Ridiculous.", "NTA.
