Same question for eloping.", "Calling what you did gaslighting is an insult to anyone who has ever been emotionally abused, ever. Your  MIL was being abusive towards your niece in order to get to you. The child's mother should be thank you for standing up for the child, but rather opted to call you a B. That says a lot about what you married into.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA\n\n  \nBut I agree that you should talk to your husband and let him handle his own family.", "NTA.

Doctor up some pics to show her she was there? Tell her you did invite her and she forgot? Those would be gaslighting. Saying \"we eloped because...\" isn't gaslighting. There is a reason the other son invited everyone but her - I imagine mom has been everyone\u2019s victim for a long time.", "NTA\n\nEveryone is correctly telling you that what is happening here isn\u2019t gaslighting, but not explaining what gaslighting is.\n\nIt is lying in the face of reality, to such an extent that the recipient of the lies starts questioning their own memory or sanity.\n\nFor example, in your case YOU could have done theoretical gaslighting as follows:\n\nMIL complains she is upset because you didn\u2019t tell her about eloping and didn\u2019t invite her to watch her son get married.\n\nYou say, \u201cwhy are you getting upset, we told you all about what we were going to do!\u201d\n\nYour MIL denies anyone told her anything.\n\nYou disagree back and forth for a while, then you call in your husband to continue the ruse and tell his mom the lie that you did tell her in advance.\n\nMIL still disagrees but is starting to weaken because her own son backs you up.\n\nFinally, your son delivers the coup de grace by saying \u201cnot only did we tell you, but you agreed and were totally cool with it because you said weddings are such a big hassle!\u201d\n\nYou leave your gaslit MIL starting to question herself and wondering whether it was possible she forgot a whole conversation she had with you two.\n\nThat\u2019s gaslighting,", "NTA- It's your and your husbands right to have whatever ceremony you wish. Now you know why her own daughter didn't invite MIL to her wedding. You didn't gaslight the cow.", "NTA. \n\nWhere\u2019s your husband in all of this? He needs to be dealing with his family members, not putting it all on you. \n\nPersonally I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for someone to be upset when their child elopes and they\u2019re not invited, most people imagine seeing their child get married one day and it can be quite a shock for that to be disrupted. \n\nThat being said, that doesn\u2019t give her the right to do any of what she\u2019s done and harass you about it.", "NTA. \"Your son and I made this decision together.

First of all,I don't see any gaslighting going on. Secondly,  I  can understand people being upset or disappointed about not being at the wedding,  but that's kind of the point of eloping.

She would have been no happier knowing it wasn't going to happen that way in advance.", "NTA. Eloping is by definition getting married secretly. Would o be upset if one of my kids eloped?

Either way this isn\u2019t gaslighting.", "NTA in anyway shape or form. You could always do a small ceremony later or a reception and let people be as if they are in a wedding party including your niece. mil was way out of line.

There's a reason her sons didn't invite her to their weddings. \n\nNTA. As annoying as this is, it is still less stress than a wedding. Congratulations. :)", "NTA. And I don't see how you were \"gaslighting\" anybody.\n\nI know a couple of people who married w/o telling anybody. One couple, they had a courthouse marriage and told everybody @ the end of the year in a holiday card. They didn't want to go thru the fuss of having a wedding, so they did it quietly. I don't know how family felt; I know his parents were both dead, so that wouldn't have been an issue. When I talked to them later they never mentioned anything about it. It was also his second marriage, so maybe not as big a deal to the family.\n\nA couple months ago a friend told she was visiting her son and his girlfriend who live in another state. While there she learned they were actually now married. She was disappointed because she'd wanted a wedding for them. But she certainly didn't make any threats like not talking to them again. Seems overreacting to say that.", "NTA, not at all!", "NTA god people are so exhausting. weddings are about marriage, a thing you do alone. i hope your elopement was everything you wanted", "NTA, sounds like you dodged a bullet. i think i see why the older brother didn't invite her to his wedding.", "NAH.\n\nWhat she said was not wrong. You did not want your families to be there when you got married. That was your choice. You're allowed to make that choice, and other people are allowed to be hurt and to talk about how hurt they are.", "NTA, its YOUR wedding. Its more like \"sorry you got your hopes up for a traditional wedding, we tried, twice, it felt like the universe was working against us. We made the Decision that felt right for us at the time. We are happy, please be happy for us.\"", "NTA. This is what eloping is. Essentially getting married in secret, getting married without many people present, and/or getting married spontaneously. Then you tell people.\n\nGranted, you can't control how family and friends react to elopement because it can hurt feelings, but MIL is being overboard about this. Firstly, she should be complaining to *her child*/your spouse, not to you. And secondly, after multiple passive aggressive comments, it's not gaslighting to call her out on it and tell her to knock it off. \n\nI would take a big step back and make your spouse deal with *their* family.", "NTA. also incorrect use of gaslighting.
