In and of itself, I don't think that's a bad way to do things.  If they did a real reception/party once they got back that would be fine.  The way this couple is doing it - no food, no drink, no entertainment, just standing around somewhere to shower the couple with gifts - that's cheap AF.  \n\nIf it were me, I'd skip the entire thing and not give a gift.  This isn't a celebration; it's a gift grab.", "So she is essentially inviting friends of friends to see if she can get more donations to their wedding. It\u2019s tacky and cheap but this is exactly what she is doing. \n\nHowever it is customary to bring a gift to the wedding celebration but I would donate \u00a330 to keep the peace and not have any drama, if you are going to the celebration.
