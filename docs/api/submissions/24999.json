Personally I find it pretty tacky holding a \"party\" to shake down people for money when you are too cheap to even buy them some drinks and snacks.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe them a gift even if you were invited to the wedding, though it\u2019s common courtesy to bring one.

No gift or even a response is necessary.
