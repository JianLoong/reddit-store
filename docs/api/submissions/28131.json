Send a card with congratulations and a heart felt message for her happiness and decline the nightclub. That is fine.", ">I don't know what to do because I'm very embarrassed to tell her that I can't afford to go.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t be.  Why is it \u201cembarrassing\u201d that you don\u2019t have as much money as the rest of the people from your school?  Wealth tends to beget wealth.  If your friends had rich parents, they\u2019re more likely to be rich themselves.  If you didn\u2019t, you probably aren\u2019t.  It\u2019s not an embarrassing fact, it\u2019s a socioeconomic fact.\n\n>WIBTA if I lie and give her a fake excuse about why I can't go?\n\nYes, because you\u2019d be giving into this idea that there\u2019s something\u2026 *shameful* about not having as much money as other people.  When in fact it\u2019s the opposite.  I think it\u2019s shameful to pretend to have more money than you actually do.  That\u2019s how people get into the kind of debt that ruins lives.\n\nJust be honest.  Tell them the event is out of your budget, but you\u2019d love to hear about it after the fact.", "NTA. When it comes down to it, if rough on your budget, best not to do it. One night with someone you aren\u2019t super close to, not worth the worry to follow from spending too much.", "Be honest with her.  Let her know you're excited for her and you'd love to come, but it's a stretch financially and you can't make it at this time.\n\n$150 per attendee for an engagement event....that's not inexpensive.", "Yes you would be the asshole. Key word, your **oldest** friend", "NTA. Asking people to shell out $300 to attend YOUR party is ridiculous. What happened to people actually hosting parties, where you provide things like food and entertainment *for* your guests?", "NAH", "NTA But don't make fake excuses. Say that it\u2019s too expensive. It\u2019s not a crime and there's nothing to be ashamed about. If she's a friend, she will understand.", "NTA I had to turn down going to a bachelorette party where the fee for just lodging was like 2k per person and I needed to fly across country and pay for several dinners on top of that. Crazy beachfront mansion shit. Rich people \ud83d\ude02 \n\nAnd when I said I couldn't afford to come ( literally had been unemployed for months prior after being laid off) I got a phone call trying to persuade me to come anyways from the person planning it. Weird thing to reiterate being poor. I said I was saving my money to plan to come to the wedding ( still had to travel for that).\n\nIf you have trouble being direct you can always lie. I usually prefer honesty myself.", "What fresh hell is this engagement outing thing?\n\nNTA", "NTA but don\u2019t lie or make up an excuse just be 100% honest. Sorry, I\u2019d love to be there for you on this special day but at the moment I can\u2019t afford it. If she really is your friend she\u2019ll understand. I myself went to private school too and on a scholarship and these types of outings are more common than people think, along with destination weddings but like I said I\u2019d she is your friend she\u2019ll understand!", "NTA\nAt 150 per person it\u2019s optional and it is fine for you to opt out. I would also advise you refuse to be a member of the bridal party if asked because this wedding is going to be very expensive for you.", "NTA, seriously stop over explaining, no is a complete sentence.", "NTA\n\nThat price is ludicrous. You're probably all covering the cost of the couple too. If you haven't spoken in a year, I wouldn't feel bad at all at turning this down. Offer to take her to lunch to celebrate instead.", "Yeah no. A friend of mine wanted her Bachelors party in Disneyland. Fine for me, but the bridesmaids paired it with a three day trip and one day in Paris. They estimated costs were around 500\u20ac. Plus flights or a bus travel because we were 20+ people. Emotional abuse followed \u201cbc we owe her the best day of her life and every single person not paying will ruin it\u201d \u201c it\u2019s not that much money\u201d and \u201cshe would spend that on you, too\u201d (she would not). She ended up with like 5 people going, some other payed because of the guilt tripping. There\u2019s another small party beforehand but I wasn\u2019t informed anymore so i didn\u2019t went and after some more harassing from one maid of honour I even skipped the wedding \ud83d\ude43", "Yeah fr", "That\u2019s perfect.  While there\u2019s always something to be said for honesty, I think it best not to introduce the whole money thing into the conversation.  The renewal of the friendship is still recent, and saying \u201cI can\u2019t afford it\u201d may simply not compute with her friend if this kind of thing is no big deal.  It\u2019s probably been a hard thing for OP to deal with throughout school and now.", "Not exactly. She's one of my oldest friends but not one of the closest. We've hit several rough patches in our friendship, and we barely talk. She didn't even congratulate me when I had my first child", "That's so weird lol", "It's an outing with the bride and groom and friends at a nightclub to celebrate them getting engaged. But each person pays for themselves.", "OMG, why does everyone think that they \u201cowe\u201d the bride the best day?  She\u2019s effing getting married\u2026.not dying.", "You have your answer. You're looking for a reason not to go, which makes you an even bigger asshole", "Just because someone is your oldest friend doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re obligated to co-sign on their foolishness.", "Then why are you considering spending this kind of money? Just say no and keep it moving. She isn\u2019t paying your bills. Life happens and sometimes we cannot do all the fun things. NTA"]}
