That is fine.", ">I don't know what to do because I'm very embarrassed to tell her that I can't afford to go.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t be.  Why is it \u201cembarrassing\u201d that you don\u2019t have as much money as the rest of the people from your school?  Wealth tends to beget wealth.  If your friends had rich parents, they\u2019re more likely to be rich themselves.  If you didn\u2019t, you probably aren\u2019t.  It\u2019s not an embarrassing fact, it\u2019s a socioeconomic fact.\n\n>WIBTA if I lie and give her a fake excuse about why I can't go?\n\nYes, because you\u2019d be giving into this idea that there\u2019s something\u2026 *shameful* about not having as much money as other people.  When in fact it\u2019s the opposite.  I think it\u2019s shameful to pretend to have more money than you actually do.  That\u2019s how people get into the kind of debt that ruins lives.\n\nJust be honest.  Tell them the event is out of your budget, but you\u2019d love to hear about it after the fact.", "NTA. When it comes down to it, if rough on your budget, best not to do it. One night with someone you aren\u2019t super close to, not worth the worry to follow from spending too much.", "Be honest with her.  Let her know you're excited for her and you'd love to come, but it's a stretch financially and you can't make it at this time.\n\n$150 per attendee for an engagement event....that's not inexpensive.", "Yes you would be the asshole. Key word, your **oldest** friend", "NTA. Asking people to shell out $300 to attend YOUR party is ridiculous. What happened to people actually hosting parties, where you provide things like food and entertainment *for* your guests?", "NAH", "NTA But don't make fake excuses. Say that it\u2019s too expensive. It\u2019s not a crime and there's nothing to be ashamed about. If she's a friend, she will understand.", "NTA I had to turn down going to a bachelorette party where the fee for just lodging was like 2k per person and I needed to fly across country and pay for several dinners on top of that. Crazy beachfront mansion shit. Rich people \ud83d\ude02 \n\nAnd when I said I couldn't afford to come ( literally had been unemployed for months prior after being laid off) I got a phone call trying to persuade me to come anyways from the person planning it. Weird thing to reiterate being poor. I said I was saving my money to plan to come to the wedding ( still had to travel for that).\n\nIf you have trouble being direct you can always lie. I usually prefer honesty myself.", "What fresh hell is this engagement outing thing?\n\nNTA", "NTA but don\u2019t lie or make up an excuse just be 100% honest. Sorry, I\u2019d love to be there for you on this special day but at the moment I can\u2019t afford it. If she really is your friend she\u2019ll understand. I myself went to private school too and on a scholarship and these types of outings are more common than people think, along with destination weddings but like I said I\u2019d she is your friend she\u2019ll understand!", "NTA\nAt 150 per person it\u2019s optional and it is fine for you to opt out. I would also advise you refuse to be a member of the bridal party if asked because this wedding is going to be very expensive for you.", "NTA, seriously stop over explaining, no is a complete sentence.", "NTA\n\nThat price is ludicrous. You're probably all covering the cost of the couple too. If you haven't spoken in a year, I wouldn't feel bad at all at turning this down. Offer to take her to lunch to celebrate instead.", "Yeah no. A friend of mine wanted her Bachelors party in Disneyland. Fine for me, but the bridesmaids paired it with a three day trip and one day in Paris. They estimated costs were around 500\u20ac. Plus flights or a bus travel because we were 20+ people. Emotional abuse followed \u201cbc we owe her the best day of her life and every single person not paying will ruin it\u201d \u201c it\u2019s not that much money\u201d and \u201cshe would spend that on you, too\u201d (she would not). She ended up with like 5 people going, some other payed because of the guilt tripping.

While there\u2019s always something to be said for honesty, I think it best not to introduce the whole money thing into the conversation.  The renewal of the friendship is still recent, and saying \u201cI can\u2019t afford it\u201d may simply not compute with her friend if this kind of thing is no big deal.  It\u2019s probably been a hard thing for OP to deal with throughout school and now.", "Not exactly. She's one of my oldest friends but not one of the closest.

You're looking for a reason not to go, which makes you an even bigger asshole", "Just because someone is your oldest friend doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re obligated to co-sign on their foolishness.", "Then why are you considering spending this kind of money? Just say no and keep it moving. She isn\u2019t paying your bills. Life happens and sometimes we cannot do all the fun things. NTA", "NTA and what is an engagement outing?  Gender reveals and multiple pre wedding parties and baby showers for second babies enough\u2026 ugh why does everything have to be a reason to have a big expensive event.  Is it just because everyone wants pics for social media?", "NTA throwing a party then asking for money to attend is tacky. I probably wouldn\u2019t go either.", "NTA, so what do you get for your 150?", "NTA. The wedding industry has gotten out of control.

Engagement parties...week long bachelor parties? Then you have the bridal shower. My husband went to midieval times for his bachelor party and then they went out for beers afterward.

Unfortunately, husband and I can't make it that night, but we're so happy for you, I hope you have an amazing time!\" If she's a polite and normal person, she won't pester you for an explanation; if she does, you can just repeat that you can't make it, or vaguely say you had other plans you can't get out of, but you're looking forward to the wedding and hope you can catch-up over a coffee sometime soon, etc. She WBTA if she makes a big issue of it. On your end, it is always ok to politely decline an invitation and you have no reason to feel bad about it.", "NTA. \n\nYou can just say no, you can make up a polite excuse, you can tell her the truth or you could potentially attend and your husband stays home with the kids if that\u2019s viable.", "WNBTA for not going, but don't lie.\n\nDecline the invite but ask her if you and she can meet for lunch sometime. If she's inclined to meet you can talk to her honestly. If she's not inclined to meet, you can decide if you want to write her a note or just let the friendship pass.

It is even to the point where when I threw my kids a birthday party, most guests asked what they could bring as far as food.  (And to be honest, we have by far the highest income from anyone who attended - it is just a habit everyone has and a kindness they offered.)  But something that\u2019s THAT expensive?  No way!

You\u2019re nta for not going.", "And \"You're invited, but bring 300$\" isn't an invitation, it's a sales pitch, \n\nessentially \"We want you to pay for our party\"", "Screw expensive weddings/bachelor parties/engagement parties.
