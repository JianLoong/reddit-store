What makes this more difficult is that his mom and dad  have guardianship over a 3 y/o. We are also getting married in 4 months. \n\nFor the last year me and my fianc\u00e9 have helped nightly with the 3 y/o (anything and everything). I help 2-3 nights/days a week while my fianc\u00e9 goes over there everyday. We are both child free so this is not my most favorite thing to do. Me and the kid do have a bond. My fianc\u00e9 has no boundaries with his family and will do whatever whenever they ask him to. \n\nHowever, I miss time/attention with my fianc\u00e9. We are trying to plan this wedding. We hardly ever go on dates or have alone time and it we do we get interrupted by a phone call and off my fianc\u00e9 goes. I am often the one that my fiance takes his anger/sadness/stress on. \n\nI get calls at night when I\u2019m in bed to come over because the kid wants a braid and only I know how to do it (fianc\u00e9s sisters don\u2019t help) or the kid is crying for me. I do it because I feel bad and it\u2019s a child that has had a hard life but I\u2019m also annoyed before I actually do it. In the end I\u2019m happy I did it. \n\nI love his mom and empathize with his pain of losing a parent and I want to help. I hate this on call 24/7 mentality. No one is taking great care of themselves. Our relationship is suffering and my fianc\u00e9 is wearing down. I\u2019m frustrated by how everything is being handled. My fianc\u00e9 and his dad let wife/mom have what she wants not needs. So, because she wants to stay home she\u2019s dying in the living room in front of the kid while bitching at her husband for everything while me and my fianc\u00e9 are doing anything/everything 24/7 with no help from his other two siblings. My fianc\u00e9s dad is 68 taking care of his dying wife and a 3 y/o with a non working kitchen. It\u2019s a mess. It\u2019s so chaotic and depressing.\n\nHis mom was doing much worse a week ago and ended up in the hospital. Being in the hospital helped her so much. She\u2019s damanding, bossy, controlling, stubborn, has a great heart, would do anything for anyone and generally is just very caring (while pushing Catholicism down your throat lol). She always wants what\u2019s hardest on everyone. Now she wants to come back hame when the hospital releases her but she really needs 24/7 care which we are not knowledgeable or capable of doing. We have a place picked out for her that she likes but she doesn\u2019t want to go now. And there\u2019s still the kid that needs help. \n\nI\u2019m at my wits end, it\u2019s hard going through all this and having all these feelings. I know my fianc\u00e9 is going through losing a parent, which is heartbreaking. I don\u2019t want him to stop helping but I want him to cut back, do what\u2019s best for his mom not what she wants and light a fire under his siblings asses because we all live super close. I feel bad even asking him to give me and our relationship a little more attention. \n\nI told him what I felt. He didn\u2019t like hearing it but is trying to be sweeter to me.

My MIL passed away from cancer a few weeks after our first was born.

I know you miss your fianc\u00e9- and I know how hard it is for you to be in call 24/7- but what little time he has left with her will never be enough. Everyone (not me) pressured my husband into returning to work and coming back to visit that weekend after we got the news they were stopping treatment. Even MIL said not to miss work.

I also completely understand the toll it takes on the caregivers, especially when there are clearly people in the family not helping as well as a young child. \nThat being said, your fianc\u00e9s mother-in-law is passing away and it may be difficult for your fianc\u00e9 to focus on the future (wedding planning) while knowing she may not be a part of it.

It\u2019s a terribly tough situation. \n\nADVICE: (If you don\u2019t want advice then you can just dismiss and I understand and am sorry, but I speak from professional experience)\n\nIs hospice involved at all? If not, I recommend talking to your family and the hospital about this possibility as they can provide a lot of help, support, and education.

Even prior to hospice, it was very, very difficult to get my parents to accept the amount of in-home help they very clearly needed. That type of resistance is very, very common and it drives familial caregivers and just family who care insane. We managed to get my parents to initially accept 12 hours a week of household help by presenting it as a situation where doing so much for my mom was too much for my dad. It\u2019s just very difficult and stressful to try to push the issue and nothing is guaranteed to work. \n\nOne tip I found helpful was to try to get a highly respected non-family member\u2014maybe in the same age range as the parents\u2014to urge them to accept some help. Someone like a priest or a long-time friend. I got my dad\u2019s beloved acupuncturist on board and that seemed to help. My parents didn\u2019t want more help even though they were having to call in a neighbor repeatedly to help lift my dad off the floor!

I guess when it\u2019s YOU in such a dire situation, it\u2019s easy to lose perspective.\n\nWhether it or not it\u2019s worth the hassle to keep pushing to get more help in there hinges in part on how much time she has left, and that\u2019s very hard to predict.\n\nYou are NOT a bad person to feel the way you feel.

I think that\u2019s a burden you could put aside.\n\nOur thing of people dying in the hospital is, historically, more the exception than the rule. Probably most people who have ever lived to adulthood have been present or nearby when someone in their household passed away. Obviously this child has already been through a lot, but she\u2019s living in the household of a dying woman and that\u2019s still the case whether the mother dies at home or elsewhere.\n\nI\u2019m just adding this because I get the sense that you think you\u2019re obligated to prevent this child from having this terrible experience. But I suspect being in proximity to an older person dying a natural death is something that isn\u2019t an automatic source of deep trauma.\n\nMy father wrote a lovely memoir about his boyhood and one of the things he wrote about was the death of his grandfather. He and his mother lived with her parents. The grandfather died when Dad was 11 and had been cared for in the home for several years before his death. My father had vivid memories of that day, but they weren\u2019t particularly negative. He was a budding magician and he was excited that so many people were coming to house who were willing to watch him perform a few magic tricks. He had fond memories of his grandfather and was not a cold or unfeeling person, but, as a child, he processed this death in a way that was childishly self-centered but probably ultimately healthy for him. I know three is very different from eleven, but my point is that dependent children care primarily about getting their needs met. If they feel secure in that, they can handle a lot of other stuff without being overwhelmed.", "As my experience of being a caretaker, I haven't seen many people bring up this point, but the child is 3. Although you can form memories at 3, they don't stick very well and usually aren't vivid. It sounds like MIL has about a year at most but even that sounds generous. This is the time to start having at home care. Although I 100% understand what you are trying to avoid, it sound like MIL won't ever be ready to go to that place. If you think about it, that's the place that's been picked for her to die at. No one wants to say it's time. I can assure you, that having the in home care will not do much in the long run when it comes to the kid, but it will make a world's diffrence for ALL of you to have the respite help. Please reconsider this option. That's what it's for. You all shouldn't have to be on call 24/7, this will solve that for the most part. \n\nAnd would it be the worst thing if the child went to the cousins place earlier? This could also solve so much for all of you.\n\nI'm sending so much love you're way. You're all doing your best.", "You absolutely don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. If the family doesn\u2019t have resources then social services and case management gets involved, not the legal system.\n\nListen to me carefully: you cannot take away someone\u2019s right to decide medical care for themselves unless they are proven to be mentally incapable of making those decisions. If the family is struggling with her care then it is on them to have a frank conversation and tell her that they can\u2019t handle it. They need to work together with the staff at the hospital to come up with a safe discharge plan. Stripping her of her medical rights as you suggest here is an awful choice, ethically speaking.", "This gave me some hope (and ideas). Thank you. I really enjoyed reading that.", "Child free is usually a descriptor for someone\u2019s decision about having children not the current state of their family planning", "As more people have made the conscious decision to not have children, it has come to mean someone who made that decision, not simply someone who doesn\u2019t have children.", "Edit:reading comprehension is hard.", "Wow thank you for your thoughtful post. Getting a non family member she respects to talk to her about this might just be  the kryptonite we need to get her the care she needs. \n\nAs for the 3 year old, I think you are right. The only hang up I have is that MIL loves to yell at and criticize FIL endlessly. The kid hears this sometimes and then she starts acting up. I don\u2019t think she needs to hear all that.", "Fantastic response. Yes, in-home hospice care with a toddler present would be LIGHT YEARS better than asking FIL and son to become hospice nurses... and ALSO take care of a toddler.", "Thank you for this.

Medicare sets the standard and most insurance plans follow.", "I'm old enough to have seen several close family members die. I watched my parents and aunts and uncles deal with 2 sets of grandparents at end of life. \n\nFortunately, while they still had their faculties, they designated their spouses or children as medical decision makers, and agreed to services like hospice care.\n\nI only mention talking to a lawyer because it sounds like Mom is going to fight this and take the family down with her. Obviously, I *hope* that they can \"work together with the staff at the hospital to come up with a safe discharge plan\", but it sounds like Mom is already arguing against the safe discharge plan that was already developed and agreed.\n\nThat puts her and her family at risk.\n\nAnd so, we can take a stand on medical rights, tell the family there isn't jack squat they can do, and watch Mom's illness destroy her husband, terrify a 3 year old toddler, and drive her adult son & his spouse into conflict. \n\nOr, do the right thing and put Mom in a safe situation with appropriate palliative and hospice care, even if it would not be her immediate preference.", "Hospice doesn\u2019t have to be at home.", "I see.

Please please enroll in Hospice! It\u2019s paid for by Medicare 100% and they will come to her house for care visits.

They may be able to help with some of the practicalities of caring for a dying person.\n2. See if you can get at home hospice support, even Medicare and Medicaid (if living in the US) have coverage. \n3. Boundaries are incredibly important in these situations. You have to create spaces that are yours and ask that others respect them. Even if it\u2019s a daily walk with your partner, this is your time and you need to do these small acts of self care. \n4. If your in-laws belong to a church or other community it may be time to ask for help. \nGood luck", "I helped care for my dying mother and it was so hard.

OP needs to be more compassionate.", "Ok, thank you for seeing the braid insanity!  The braid situation with that child is insane.

Pull together.", "OP, I say this with the utmost respect & all the empathy that I have to give: I'm so  sorry that you're all held captive by this collective nightmare.I know that you already know that this current situation is not sustainable. That's why you're here.  My heart aches for you & your fiance & the whole family. Having said that, to continue to try & pretzel yourselves into contortions to try & keep the bottom from falling out is only postponing the inevitable.\n\nSorry in advance for the length (& likely the formatting) but I think it helps to break down the elements at play. As I see it, \n\n Problem 1: there is a 3 year old child who clearly is not getting their emotional & physical needs met & prioritized, because the adults are grieving, in denial &/or already spread too thin. \n\nProblem 2: there is a dying adult, who is still mentally competent enough to be in control of her own decisions, but who is, for multiple reasons,  not making healthy choices & this impacts not only her circumstances, but everyone else involved.\n\n Problem 3: FIL is not willing or able to put enough distance between himself & the situation to either take the bull by the horns & rectify what can be made better (fix kitchen, insist on home care etc) or admit that he cannot handle the situation as a whole & ask for help. \n\nProblem 4: Fiance is pre-occupied (understandably) with the fact that their Mom is dying & there is a child's well-being that's held in the balance AND they're trying to burn the candle at both ends to take care of their nuclear family AND begin a new life with you.\n\n Problem 5: You're caught in the middle of this whirlwind. \n\nFirst off, truly, I'm so sorry that you all find yourself in this scenario. There are NO easy answers & it's clear that both you & your fiance care very much about each other & his family at large. I know that it sucks (Oh So Much) to be looking forward to this new stage in your lives together & feeling like your new life is already on the backburner before it has actually even begun. \n\nI say this having experienced the sudden death of my SIL to be 2 months before our wedding, which left her two young daughters orphaned for all intents & purposes. It was brutal, & heavy & I offered to postpone our wedding at the time (my husband did not want to do that & we did move forward & made the day as special & meaningful as we could, involving the girls & being cognizant of their needs). I share this because I want you to know that what you're feeling is normal & understandable. It is valid for you to be missing alone time with your partner & time to focus on the 2 of you & your lives together. \n\n I also want to point out, as others have, that the kind of human that you're marrying is being illuminated by the crisis in front of you & they are proving themselves to be loving, loyal & involved when the excrement hits the proverbial fan. They are losing a parent & watching their other parent flounder & they know a small child is caught betwixt the two. It must seem like there aren't enough hours in the day for them to give what they want to give to the people they care about.\n\nQuestions To Address:\n Re: Problem 1: Does your fiance not want you both to take this child in until their cousin can take over because they think YOU don't want to be placed in that role (as you mentioned being child free) or is there another reason why that couldn't be done, even on a short term basis to at least conquer & divide the resources? Or, would it be possible for this Little One to go stay with the cousin now, to help them get established in a forever home, while simultaneously allowing you guys to rally around MIL & help increase the quality of life for everyone? This baby needs to have the undivided attention of caring individuals & IF that is not feasible in the current home, then an alternative must be found.\n\nRe: Problem 2: Certainly, MIL, as a competent adult, gets to have a say in how she leaves this earth. HOWEVER, if she is to be discharged from a hospital, she MUST be able to go someplace safe that can meet her needs. I would argue that a non working kitchen does not fulfill that requirement. Perhaps speaking with the social worker at the hospital, after having a Come To Jesus meeting with FIL & Fiance about what would need to happen before MIL can SAFELY come home, might buy you a bit more time & it COULD help MIL to see that she may have to reconsider her plans. I know it seems harsh, but at the end of the day, she needs as many troops rallied around her (and you all) as she can. Has someone talked with her Priest? Or her Church community? Far too often, we wait until we are so mired in crisis before we reach out for help & all it does is exhaust our own resources & make it harder to muster the energy to pull together when it's most needed. Y'all need ALL the help you can get. If it hasn't been explored, now is the time & while she is still in hospital, maybe a mediated conversation with MIL would be helpful to ask her what she most wants & needs right now & then try to broker a compromise from there. It won't be perfect, for anyone, but it doesn't have to be THIS hard.\n\nRE: Problem 3: FIL is lost at the moment. Not sure if this is just his personality or a combination of grief & circumstance, but he needs support & honest communication. If he can't hear it from you two, who MIGHT he hear some very necessary home truths from? \n\nRE: Problem 4 & 5: You both need to REALLY talk about how you're coping, honestly & take the Team Approach to this, & every situation that you're confronted with. Maybe for your own sanity, you decide to push the wedding back or scale it down or enlist friends to help you handle the myriad of things that need to get done. Talk about hesitations about bringing Little One into your home, even for the duration or how to make the home environment more stable & predictable for you all. Routine is vital & there doesn't seem to be much of one, because everyone is just (understandably) running from one crisis to the next. If you can make it through this challenge, your relationship will be stronger for it, but ONLY if you cement the \"We're on the same Team & we're IN this together\" approach. People only have so much emotional, mental & physical energy in their reserves & you both must be running on fumes right now. I know it may seem bonkers, given how much is already on your plate, but I would be signing up for counseling yesterday if it was at all possible. To help with the anticipatory grief & to get the perspective of someone not completely enmeshed within this emotional cluster. \n\nLong story long, this SUCKS, NAH, you have a HUGE heart, this CAN get better IF people are willing to be honest about how bad the situation is & push through the uncomfortability to get to  a more holistic approach to the entire dynamic. I want to encourage you to take stock of your strengths & the strengths of those around you, advocate like it's your collective job for a better outcome for MIL & Little One, stand beside your Fiance & continue to face these challenges together & know that you're not alone & SO many of us are sending you peace, strength & hope. Xo", "\u2764\ufe0f. We are and that\u2019s ok, it\u2019s just hard to get through. It brings me comfort knowing that these times will somehow bring beauty to our life somewhere down the road. \n\nI\u2019ve offered the idea to my fianc\u00e9 that we could get guardianship over her but he wasn\u2019t on board with that. \n\nI believe the FIL will move to another state where there\u2019s more family to help. My fianc\u00e9s cousin lives there and she\u2019s like to care for the kid because she can have anymore children. She\u2019s really sweet and her baby has cystic fibrosis."]}
