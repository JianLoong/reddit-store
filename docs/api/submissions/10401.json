What makes this more difficult is that his mom and dad  have guardianship over a 3 y/o.

I help 2-3 nights/days a week while my fianc\u00e9 goes over there everyday. We are both child free so this is not my most favorite thing to do. Me and the kid do have a bond. My fianc\u00e9 has no boundaries with his family and will do whatever whenever they ask him to. \n\nHowever, I miss time/attention with my fianc\u00e9. We are trying to plan this wedding. We hardly ever go on dates or have alone time and it we do we get interrupted by a phone call and off my fianc\u00e9 goes. I am often the one that my fiance takes his anger/sadness/stress on. \n\nI get calls at night when I\u2019m in bed to come over because the kid wants a braid and only I know how to do it (fianc\u00e9s sisters don\u2019t help) or the kid is crying for me. I do it because I feel bad and it\u2019s a child that has had a hard life but I\u2019m also annoyed before I actually do it. In the end I\u2019m happy I did it. \n\nI love his mom and empathize with his pain of losing a parent and I want to help. I hate this on call 24/7 mentality. No one is taking great care of themselves. Our relationship is suffering and my fianc\u00e9 is wearing down. I\u2019m frustrated by how everything is being handled. My fianc\u00e9 and his dad let wife/mom have what she wants not needs.

My fianc\u00e9s dad is 68 taking care of his dying wife and a 3 y/o with a non working kitchen. It\u2019s a mess. It\u2019s so chaotic and depressing.\n\nHis mom was doing much worse a week ago and ended up in the hospital. Being in the hospital helped her so much. She\u2019s damanding, bossy, controlling, stubborn, has a great heart, would do anything for anyone and generally is just very caring (while pushing Catholicism down your throat lol). She always wants what\u2019s hardest on everyone. Now she wants to come back hame when the hospital releases her but she really needs 24/7 care which we are not knowledgeable or capable of doing. We have a place picked out for her that she likes but she doesn\u2019t want to go now. And there\u2019s still the kid that needs help. \n\nI\u2019m at my wits end, it\u2019s hard going through all this and having all these feelings. I know my fianc\u00e9 is going through losing a parent, which is heartbreaking. I don\u2019t want him to stop helping but I want him to cut back, do what\u2019s best for his mom not what she wants and light a fire under his siblings asses because we all live super close.

Miraculously,  he lived far longer than anticipated and I was lucky enough to have him at my wedding. He was also able to walk me(slowley!) Down the isle. My husband allowed me to provide all the support he needed without complaints. Even though it was hard on him and our relationship.  Because of that, we have a much stronger relationship.  Give him the same grace. Support him in this. This will be a short time when compared to the rest of your life. On a side note,  If its plausible,  I would also arrainge to get married while shes still with you.

Honestly, I thought she was going to die this week.

Any time the 3yo could spend out of the situation would be good and would take some of the burden off you and the rest of the family).\n\nI think you and fiance need to go to couples counselling together.

You, her son and her husband are not going to be capable of doing what needs to be done--hospice care at home would be an immense help to all of you and the people who do this know how to help those in this type of situation.

I laid it out with the hospice group that no mention of the word hospice was to be used, they were visiting nurses... Which they were.  Hospice can provide medical equipment, cover the cost of medications, visiting medical care and very often grief counseling for the patient *and their families*.  It didn't take long for her to realize it was less about end of life as it was helping her be comfortable and take pressure off so all of us could spemd our time with each other through this.\n\nI feel for you, OP, and I really feel for your husband. We were able to keep mom at home to the very end and I was with her  when she passed. It was also a \"drop everything when I get a call\" situation for a few months and it was hard as hell.  I would not have done anything differently though. My husband quietly handled support while my sister and I did everything we could, and then a year later it was my turn as his father declined and passed over about 8 months.\n\nIt hurts, it's hard, everyone's upset and will take it out on each other at times.
