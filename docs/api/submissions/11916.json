We've lived together for about 5 years.\n\nA few times in the last month, I've come home to mail addressed to me that has already been opened by my gf. The first time it was a package (solar blankets I had ordered for camping or emergency situations). She was also expecting a package but it would have been much bigger. Most recently, I got a letter from my uncle, addressed to me. On the return address it listed his business, basically realty. \n\nShe opened the letter on the grounds that she also owns the land we live on (we are both legal owners). It turns out the letter was about other land in the area that was coming up for sale, and most likely sent out to all his clients. \n\nI asked her to stop opening mail that was addressed to me (not that I'm particularly protective of my solar blankets or land prospects I can't afford, nor am I trying to hide anything). We are in general a pretty open and easy going couple but I feel this is an invasion of my privacy and rude on her part. She blew up and got all pissy at this request. \n\nSo, am I an ass hole for expecting my partner to not read my mail?\n\nUpdate: without further conversation, she apologized. She included a 'I didn't realize it was important to you' in there which I feel is kinda weak but whatever. At this point it's not worth stressing over, so long as she doesn't keep snooping into my personal stuff. Thanks all.
