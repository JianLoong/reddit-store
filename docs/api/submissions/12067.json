They have the means to get living spaces of their own, but we all enjoy this arrangements. In fact, I was specifically searching for a home with a guest house space. We split the utilities, but I don't charge them rent.\n\nThere's an open door policy when it comes to me coming and going. I'll usually go hang out with them after dinner, and sometimes if I can't sleep I'll go hang out. They're welcome to come hang out at the main house anytime they see my car in the driveway so they know I'm there. Occasionally my wife will join us for these hang outs but it isn't often. She and my friend/my brother seem to have conflicting personalities.\n\nAn incident occurred two weeks when my friend came home and found my wife standing in the living room of the guest house on her phone. This was obviously strange and a little off putting, but he just greeted her and went to his room. She left a little while later. He brought this up to me, but asked me not to say anything to her. He figured there was a logical explanation and didn't want to cause issues.\n\nThe same thing happened to my brother. He came home a few days after the first instance, and she was in the living room on her way out. He was confused and asked her what she was doing, but she just brushed things off. I wasn't told about this when it happened. The final straw came just a few days ago when my best friend came home and found my wife in his actual room. He was obviously caught off guard and kind of raised his voice asking her to leave.\n\nAfter I was updated on these final two instances, I spoke to my friend and brother about what they wanted to do. We finally decided to get the locks changed on the guest house doors. They were creeped out and felt unsafe with their privacy being invaded. When my wife discovered I had done this, she was livid. I tried to ask her why she kept going into the house, but she wouldn't tell me. She just kept reiterating that it was part of her home and she should be allowed to go in it.\n\nThis whole thing has me confused and a little freaked out. AITA?\n\nEdit: My brother and his friend have to knock and be invited in before entering our house. They can't just barge in, even if they know I'm there.\n\nEdit 2: I pay 80% of the mortgage. At one point, I was paying 100% of it. My brother and his friend have offered to pay multiple times and always remind me they would like to. They also contribute to the house in other ways, like buying groceries and fixing things there and in the main house.\n\nEdit 3: My brother eats dinner with my wife and I once a week, and I spend the afternoon with him and my friend about once a week. I spend 5 to 6 nights per week with just my wife.", "created_utc": 1678584386, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11p1dud/aita_for_banning_my_wife_from_the_guest_house_and/", "score": 3075, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They have the means to get living spaces of their own, but we all enjoy this arrangements. In fact, I was specifically searching for a home with a guest house space. We split the utilities, but I don't charge them rent. \n\nThere's an open door policy when it comes to me coming and going. I'll usually go hang out with them after dinner, and sometimes if I can't sleep I'll go hang out. They're welcome to come hang out at the main house anytime they see my car in the driveway so they know I'm there. Occasionally my wife will join us for these hang outs but it isn't often. She and my friend/my brother seem to have conflicting personalities. \n\nAn incident occurred two weeks when my friend came home and found my wife standing in the living room of the guest house on her phone. This was obviously strange and a little off putting, but he just greeted her and went to his room. She left a little while later. He brought this up to me, but asked me not to say anything to her. He figured there was a logical explanation and didn't want to cause issues.\n\nThe same thing happened to my brother. He came home a few days after the first instance, and she was in the living room on her way out. He was confused and asked her what she was doing, but she just brushed things off. I wasn't told about this when it happened. The final straw came just a few days ago when my best friend came home and found my wife in his actual room. He was obviously caught off guard and kind of raised his voice asking her to leave.\n\nAfter I was updated on these final two instances, I spoke to my friend and brother about what they wanted to do. We finally decided to get the locks changed on the guest house doors. They were creeped out and felt unsafe with their privacy being invaded. When my wife discovered I had done this, she was livid. I tried to ask her why she kept going into the house, but she wouldn't tell me. She just kept reiterating that it was part of her home and she should be allowed to go in it. \n\nThis whole thing has me confused and a little freaked out.

You and your wife bought a home where the mortgage currently is splint 80/20 between the two of you\n2. Your wife did not \u201clove\u201d the idea of your brother and friend living in your home. Call it a guest house all you want, it\u2019s still part of her and your home. And frankly you can\u2019t be that dense. She didn\u2019t want this. You know it deep down but you seem to not want to actually see it bc it\u2019ll hurt your ego or whatever. If you had to talk her into this, she didn\u2019t want it. \n3. She ONLY agreed to this arrangement based on everyone having their own space BUT they can come into her home without her say when you\u2019re there, because YOU say so. But she can\u2019t go into \u201ctheir\u201d space, despite the fact she PAYS for their space. \n\nLet\u2019s be really really clear here. She does not have free reign or even have a say in this. Imagine buying a whole house and your space is ONLY your bedroom like you\u2019re living in a dorm room with strangers in college. Her living room and kitchen is a college student center, and she has to figure every time your home, your brother and friend will be there as well. She does not deserve this. Frankly she could have thought she lost something, needed a new change of scenery, wanted to check something with the home. Whatever. But like it or not. That\u2019s HER home as well, especially since she contributes to it. They do not. She\u2019s paying for them to stay there for nothing. She might even just be trying to show how it feels to walk in or down the stairs to someone you didn\u2019t even know was there in your home and feeling uncomfortable. You\u2019re frankly, an awful husband and hide behind your finances to justify prioritizing two grown ass men who 1. Can care for themselves, 2. Are taking advantage of you and more so YOUR WIFES good nature, and 3. are going to sink your marriage faster than the titanic. She didn\u2019t give permission for them to enter her space whenever YOU say so. You promised her that everyone will have their own space, but her home isn\u2019t even her space. You made sure of that. The rule is it takes 2 yes\u2019 and 1 no. YTA for pushing your wife into an agreement you can\u2019t even live up to and prioritizing your friend and brother over your wife.", "This DEF seems like YTA\nbecause the way you talk and present things. \nYou're making it seem like wife's fault. \nNot for once I read you sitting down and having a conversation with her. There is something definitely going on and you're being a total ass about it.", "Give the phone to your wife. Let us hear her side. However it feels like this arrangement happened cause of YOU.

I don't even know who sucks.or.is the asshole bc I'm just baffled.\n\nalso why does this whole thing read like you bought basically a home for you and your bros - who you spend all your time with.  And now you're banning your wife from the guest house bc your bros said they found her in the guest house randomly.\n\nThere seems to be some...parts out of place.\n\nETA: YTA \n\nthe wife not being on the mortgage, forced to live in frat Land, pays 20% on a house she doesn't own, and has to put up with who knows what else while according to you isn't allowed any say in these things. wow. I hope she gets a good divorce lawyer", "You are married. Not a 30-something year old frat boy. Start to grow up.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you pay majority of the mortgage, you entered a marriage.

Of course, it's kind of obvious you prefer their company to your wife's.  YTA.", "YTA - you and your dad are trying to pull a fast one on your wife.

Even if you spend 100% of the mortgage, it is an asset of the marriage and when she divorces you, she'll get half.

So after being excluded from the deed because lacking of seed money, she decides to put her foot down to have some sort of stake in her home, yet you still exclude her from choices in regards to her own home. Feeling like a second-class citizen in what is supposed to be your marital home, she decided to assert her control of her life by going into the guest home. \n\nAlso, I'm sure she's getting vibes from you and probably sees women going in and out of that place and wants some sort of proof you might be unfaithful.\n\nEdited to add YTA. put your wife on the stupid deed and talk to her unless you are OK with losing her.", "I\u2019ve got to say that allowing people who are begging to pay rent to live in square footage you pay the mortgage on is suspect. What would compel you to make such a shortsighted and immature financial decision like this? What are you getting out of this situation that offsets it? If I were your wife, I\u2019d be pretty upset. You could be renting this place out to them or others and enriching your future as a couple. That\u2019s your retirement, savings, and investment dollars you\u2019re flushing down the toilet so that your man cave comes pre-stocked with pals. Again, suspect. \n\nWhich leads me to this:\n\nBased on what little you\u2019re saying, my best guess if that you\u2019re getting high with them in this building. You lie to your wife about it and she\u2019s been trying to prove her instincts right by looking for the drugs while you guys are gone. That would explain why you\u2019re protecting them and yourself above your marriage and wife. It\u2019s either drugs or some other nefarious shit. \n\nNo matter what, YTA. In a variety of ways, you\u2019re placing your brother, the friend, and whatever nonsense you guys are up to above your wife and marriage. Good husbands don\u2019t do stuff like this.

Some people don\u2019t get marriage and I feel really bad for your wife. If they don\u2019t like what your wife does in her own home then BYE FELICIA", "YTA. Your wife us clearly not happy with this arrangement. I don't care who pays the mortgage, you are married to her not your bro or mates. Talk to talk to your wife before she becomes your ex-wife.", "You never had a conversation w your wife before you changed the locks? She your wife or a roommate or friend?  YTA.", "You keep commenting that you're interested in hearing Reddit's guesses as to why your wife would be in the guest house, but you won't have a serious conversation with her? You'll go to your brother and friend without going to her at all? You're setting yourself up for failure here.\n\nYTA.", "It is very strange you didn\u2019t even talk to your wife first, I would love to hear her side of this.", "YTA\n\nThe only ones who are happy are you men not her. Time for them to move.", "INFO: why didn\u2019t you confront your wife about it before changing the locks?", "YTA. Both based on what you\u2019ve said and what you are leaving out. I would love to hear your wife\u2019s side of the story", "YTA", "I'm wondering if the friend is a woman.", "Yuuuup\n\nSomething tells me not everyone is happy with this arrangement, at least", "i hope the op provides an update on this and hoping the wife finally gives an answer.  i cant think of any reason why she would be in their guesthouse invading their space", "I\u2019m very curious about what she was actually doing.", "Yeah, more info. Also what kind of marriage are you in that you can\u2019t talk about it with your wife, and decide instead to let the guests choose that she not be told???", "I want her to show up if for no other reason than to encourage a divorce. This poor woman.", "Same, it just feels like so many things are being kept hidden from the story. Their reactions doesn't seem normal until the bedroom part, and even then they immediately decide to change the locks instead of talking to her? Treating her like a distant relative being nosy? They're definitely hiding something in that guest house.", "I\u2019m hearing \u201cmy wife who pays part of the mortgage and has her name on the deed walks around her home as she pleases. My brother and friend who do not pay rent and are essentially squatting in her guest house think it\u2019s creepy when she enters her home\u201d. Op needs to decide if he wants roommates or a wife. If his brother and friend want a locked door, they need a formal rental agreement and monthly rent. Sounds like the wife has zero say in what is happening in her own home.\n\nOp: your wife obviously shouldn\u2019t be walking around the guest house alone and uninvited, but she clearly thinks you it\u2019s are up to something, and you likely are. The entire situation seems suspect.", "So many questions here. The brother and mutual friend just live together rent free together in a guest house? It\u2019s such a strange situation - I can\u2019t even imagine what the wife will say about it.", "His friends are welcome to come hang out at the main house anytime his car is in the driveway?! Double standard much? She can\u2019t go inspect the guest house because it seems like a frat party house and she is just most likely inspecting for damages. \n\nWhy are they so worried about the wife being in her own guesthouse? Seems like they have something to hide because of their reactions. They don\u2019t pay rent, just party and live on her property, which is just as much hers as husband\u2019s. \n\nAny wife would feel betrayed if her husband changed the locks on part of their property.\n\nOP and his friends are MAJOR YTA", "Exactly!  Just went and changed locks w out having a convo w wife??", "Yep. I sense something highly suspicious regarding what OP, brother, and mutual friend are doing in the guest house. Honestly, my hunch is that it involves something illegal, maybe even something involving some sex crimes that they are all into, if you get my drift...", "I think it's pretty clear. \n\nThey are not all happy with the arrangement and she is trying to make this clear since apparently nothing she says is getting the point across. \n\nLike wtf I don't care who pays the mortgage one party cannot just change the locks on part of their property without giving the other one access!", "Let's hope for updates. I'm so curious.", "Lmfao!", "Wins the internet", "I think the friend is a mutual friend of his brother and him, and they both basically live in the guesthouse. None of them seems to be friends with the wife.", "Good observation!", "Ok this is horrifying - it is a red flag for me when men feel the need to point out the percentage their wives pay on a home (women often earn less for many reasons outside the home but contribute within it to a disproportionate degree so this is never as factual as it sounds) but to hear he hasn\u2019t put her name on the deed is\u2026 not good. \n\nTo OP: YTA.", "it also seems like its their first home as a married couple and what kind of person thinks \u201clet me find a house for all my buddies to live in too!! fuck the honeymoon period!!\u201d?? like it just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. seems like hes more married to his buddies than his actual wife", "She isn\u2019t on the deed?!", "In California, this situation is actually incredibly difficult to untangle. I would bet my left ass cheek they\u2019re listed as tenants and pay the \u201cmortgage\u201d as rent. I had a client who did this exact thing, in the event he and his wife got divorced. Turns out the court determined, in my client\u2019s case, that because they were on a signed 10 year lease, she got nothing.", "We really need to hear the wife\u2019s side on this. This is very odd.", "Yes, interesting the way OP described that person. Are the brother and this person a couple?", "Absolutely  also  my take.", "Since the 3 men are the ones who want to socialize, perhaps they can do so exclusively in the guest house 2/3 inhabit and give OP\u2019s wife some privacy and space. It would be really difficult for most people knowing that guests are likely to swing by at almost any time. \n\nI\u2019d also be curious about the food & housekeeping situation in both homes. If they\u2019re neat, tidy, clean, quiet and considerate that\u2019s great. But I\u2019m picturing more of a \u201craid the fridge and hang out in the tidy space\u201d dynamic. OP can correct me if I\u2019m way out of line on this.", "For OP, the difference seems to be that he hangs with them in the guest house when they are present, and they sometimes hang with him in the main house when he's home. That's a bit different than the wife hanging in the friend's bedroom when no one is home. That's peculiar, as is the no explanation. Communication is sorely lacking all around. \n\nI agree the wife does seem to come in secondary to the brother and friend, and perhaps the marriage was a mistake.", "Totally agree with you. Why do I get the whole childish \"no girls allowed in the fort/tree house/ den from this?\n\nOP is 100% the asshole and probably won't be married for too much longer", "He\u2019s in a relationship with the guest house freeloaders. So yea.", "O M G", "I think that's exactly what's going on. I think she needs to divorce him and go somewhere where things are not weird.", "There\u2019s def something weird going on in the back house.", "He is not talking to her about it because I bet they had many conversations about him spending way too much time with his best friend", "Because all three of them have something they don't want her to find out. That's the first and only explanation also the easiest. Occam's razor.", "He stated in another comment that his FATHER is on the deed, but Daddy told him she shouldn't be, so he left her off. She's paying part of the mortgage but she isn't allowed on the deed.", "Heck even if she didn\u2019t have a financial stake (she does) it\u2019s still their marital home", "There is a reason as to why she wasn\u2019t in love with the idea that OP is conveniently leaving out. Why would you move people on the property when you know your wife doesn\u2019t have the greatest relationship?", "If you want to support freeloaders and keep her out of the space, pay the entire mortgage.", "I\u2019m thinking the wife is letting herself be caught in the guesthouse to make them feel uncomfortable so they move out. She probably hates them being there since her husband abandons her in the middle of the night.", "She wants to know what they are doing out there.  Drugs. Sex. Gambling. Porn. Things she\u2019s not comfortable with (this varies by person obviously). She\u2019s looking for wtf her husband is doing in her backyard frat house all the damn time.", "She's trying to figure out WTF the deal is with that situation.  It definitely sounds like OP doesn't listen to her and what she'd like to see in her own home.  She clearly doesn't feel heard and wants to know what goes on in the guest house.  I can't imagine why she stays with such an AH, but to each their own.", "He did not put her on the deed though so OP seems shady as hell and seems to only look out for himself not his wife.", "Also pay a divorce lawyer in this scenario.", "Exactly. And does OP even care to ask his wife why she is going to the guest house?? Not that she needs any specific reason, like you said, it is part of her home. But OP doesn't even seem to care to ask her. It seems like his communication with her is in the sewer and his loyalty is completely to his bros.", "You nailed it. OP's brother and \"close friend\" is sus as hell. So, either OP is having an affair with the \"close friend\" or there are big drugs involved. OP is spending 90% of his waking and non-working hours in the guest house. On the property he bought especially so they could live there. His wife may have been trying to find some evidence of the affair and/or the big drugs. Can't blame her a bit.", "Sounds like she is reiterating it\u2019s her house and she can go where she wants, which tells me she is not happy with this arrangement and wants the space back or better privacy in the main house.", "For pulling them in the first place when your wife wasn't keen on the idea. She has paid for part of this house, but currently she does not have access to the part of the property she is paying for!", "That's because it is weird.  And it really seems, without even more detail, that OP is YTA.  No matter who pays the mortgage, Op is married to his wife.  In many states, this means it is her house, too.  I can not imagine a scenario where I would be comfortable with this situation.\n\nETA: And OP has the fucking nerve to say he's 'a little freaked out'. What an AH.", "like the part about the side piece hanging out in the guest house?", "When is it not half of a story? Unless the OPs wife writes her own or they both right the story together..", "The OP referred the friend as \u201che\u201d.", "Yeeees, this is the first thing I thought. She's looking for evidence of drugs because of a possibly long ongoing conflict about it between her and the husband. Or stolen items from the main house?", "And they are buying drugs in exchange for rent.", "I thought the usual ending for this kind of story was the husband running off with his friend. I guess in this case it would be an incestuous threesome, and it wouldn't surprise me.", "Maybe wife was laying on friends bed hoping to get some action but friend totally missed the \u2018come-on\u2019. Could\u2019ve gotten a piece.", "It's q good guess!!", "THIS. Thank you.", "This is at least as factual as the original post", "But why in the he!! does she need to be in the best friend's bedroom without his knowledge? That's just creepy.", "It is very obvious from the post that it is a house, not a \"hangout.\" The brother and friend live there and she was in the friend's bedroom. How is that NOT weird?", "Not even the husband!", "I feel so bad for the wife. I hope she has friends and people in her life who care about her since her husband does not seem to. He definitely does not want an equal in his marriage.", "Perhaps, but that makes it worse.", "What do you mean? He talked to his boys and they concluded on changing the locks on his wife.", "Everyone is assuming she was searching for evidence but if it was me in the situation it would be just as likely that I was in there cleaning because the frat house reeks so badly I can smell it from my bedroom but I don't want to bring it up because I know no one but me would give a shit.", "You clearly prefer spending time with your brother and pals who live rent-free in your home than you do with your wife.", "My husband\u2019s friend lived with us for about nine months some years ago. I agreed to it in the beginning but it quickly became apparent that I was very wrong about my ability to live with someone I didn\u2019t particularly like.  \n\nIn retrospect I can see that my husband was stuck in the middle of dealing with both of us, and that there was a huge amount of triangulation and undermining of our relationship going on, but at the time all I knew was that I was becoming more and more depressed and isolated from my husband, especially when he started siding with his friend over me more often than not (most of it was about small things like his friend eating food I set aside for myself to take to work for lunch, leaving messes everywhere, passing out drunk on the couch several nights per week). I asked him to tell his friend he needed to leave but he wouldn\u2019t, so eventually I did (luckily he left, although I\u2019m pretty sure he would legally have been considered a tenant). My relationship with my husband never fully recovered from that experience (we\u2019re currently separated because this situation was one of many issues in our marriage). \n\nAnyway, my point is that I agreed to let my husband\u2019s friend stay with us but later realized I couldn\u2019t handle it, and the fact that my husband prioritized his friend over me felt like a betrayal. Lots of people wouldn\u2019t feel or react the same way I did, but I imagine OP\u2019s wife can relate (not condoning her going into their space without permission though).", "Yep, good point. First to mention that.", "The key word is **high**", "Bingo! She's his beard.", "It\u2019s not even their first home. He made a comment else where she\u2019s not even on the deed based on advice from his parents", "No. He commented that he and his dad are on the deed and this is after being given the advice by his dad not to buy it with her because it was being bought with premarital funds. I\u2019m not even sure that matters unless there is a prenup if the house was bought after they were married and it sounds like they were", "Oh, that makes me wonder. You think dad bought the house outright, but she doesn\u2019t know that and is contributing to what she thinks is the mortgage when it really isn\u2019t? And OP is lying about there being a mortgage and is just knowingly paying dad back in the form of rent?", "Great point!\n\nPLUS, if anyone wasn\u2019t contributing (monetarily) it be OPs WIFE!!!!!\n\nNOT two grown ass men!", "Say no more", "Doesn't sound like it. Also interesting how everyones gender is mentioned except friend. What is the betting that friend is a woman and OPs wife suspects they are hooking up and was looking for evidence. Or even that it's a dude and OPs wife suspects they are hooking up and is looking for evidence. \n\nI wonder, did these incidents happen immediately after OP couldn't sleep and went over there? \n\nThis whole thing is absolutely psychotic and we are missing at least half the story. \n\nI'm always amazed by the AITAs where the OP quite plainly writes themselves as TA and yet doesn't see it.", "He says they're both single, but that could be 'single' in the way that you used to have those two spinster aunts who lived together.", "This entire situation is sus as fuck.", "Not go out and hang out in the frat house in your back yard", "Yeah but do you really think if the friends *didn't* live on the same plot of land that he would be driving over to see him every time he can't sleep?", "He's not treating her as a wife, though.
