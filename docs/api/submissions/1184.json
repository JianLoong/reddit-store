Make you think \"oh hey maybe a girl does actually like me after all\" only to laugh in your face and call you an idiot in front of all your friends when you finally work up the nerve to ask her out. I basically just avoid her entirely. I don\u2019t help her with school work nor do I go out of my way to make her life harder.\n\nanyways she was there during the party, around 4AM most of the guys had left, she and her friend who was apparently gonna sleep over at her house asked if I could walk them home, they didn\u2019t wanna ask for an uber because it\u2019s not that far.\n\nI basically laughed at them and told them they can walk themselves, keep in mind it was also freezing and raining that night, they told me in a jerk and asked somebody else, and fun fact she actually blocked me on social media later that evening but frankly idc, she\u2019s never been nice to me, if it was Sarah, Lily or one of my close friends I would have walked them home with absolutely no problem, but I don\u2019t owe Evelyn anything.\n\nAfterwards I told my dad this and he got absolutely furious at me saying this is the kind of stuff you gotta set personal feelings aside for and we argued but idgaf.

It's part and parcel of establishing your own moral code as you grow up. There are circumstances where history must be put aside. You're right, she was mean to you.

Evelyn and her friend are AHs for assuming that some random guy has some kind of responsibility to walk them home.\n\nYour statement is that it would be unsafe for young women to walk even a short distance at night in your town. Evelyn and her friend know this, and need to plan accordingly, and not just assume that there will be some guy who can walk them home.\n\nEvelyn's reasonable options were:\n\n1. Arrange in advance for a friend to walk them home\n2. Pay for an uber \n3. Drive herself\n4. Call her parents for a ride\n\nIt's not like she unexpectedly found herself stranded in a bad part of town at 4am and landed on OP's doorstep - she planned to attend this party until the small hours of the morning, and should have planned for how she was getting home again.", "ESH except for your dad. Evelyn sounds like an AH, but you might as well have told her to get raped on the walk home. Would it have ruined your whole night to help a couple of girls be safe on the walk home?", "NTA. The girls should have planned ahead about how they were going to get home.
