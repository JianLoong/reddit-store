It's a quality of mine that I'm trying to improve on. Which is why I humor him when he does this from time to time. \n\nI tried telling him that I feel embarrassed to come up to random people asking them if they're from the same country (as if racially profiling them). But he keeps doing it, believing that it's nothing malicious, and \"are you not happy to see people from your own country?\". \n\nAnyway, fast forward to today, he's away on a business trip and he knows that he has colleagues who are from my country. I noticed that I had missed calls from him so I called back. Apparently, he was gonna introduce me to his colleague so we can speak together in my native language. \n\nHe's introducing me to a colleague just because we're from the same country!! I just had enough. And I told him to stop randomly introducing me to people just because we're from the same country; it's not funny. \n\nI saw the hurt on his face as he agreed. I feel so bad now.

But it's still annoying and a form of racism. \n\nWhy is it a form of racism? Because: \n\n1. He is acting like your country of origin is the most important thing about you and that you should somehow have a kinship with every single person from your same country. In reality, I would assume that you have a lot of other qualities that would unite you more with people with similar interests. You didn't get to choose where you were born.

He is constantly pointing out your \"otherness\" by going to talk to every single Asian person to see if they are from the same country as you. He is constantly making a big deal of the one thing that makes you different from him. You don't constantly need to be reminded that you are not from his same country and that you aren't like him. You are not an alien creature looking for those of your same kind. You are just a normal human being who happened to be born in another country.\n\nAgain, I hope I gave you some additional ideas of ways that you could explain to your bf that while he might think what he is doing is cute and charming, you don't like it and he really needs to stop.", "NTA.

He didn\u2019t specify he was talking about me, but I got the point immediately and haven\u2019t done it again. \n\nIt sounds like your boyfriend didn\u2019t get it the first time when you were trying to be polite, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with asserting your boundaries.

That sounds SO MUCH BETTER\n\nAnd if serially introducing her to everyone he encounters who may be from the same  region as her TO IMPROVE AND FIX HER is his love language, dude must be deaf.", "Okay, so it's not like you saying you miss your family and he's trying to have you interact with others of you nationality to bridge a gap.  \nYeah that's extremely offensive and I'd definitely talk to him about how it made you feel.

I was trying to find a potential \"benign\" reason but this one is really hard.\n\nI would never consider doing that to my girlfriend, it feels sort of... Fetishy?

He might be well meaning, but what he's doing could also (depending on where he does it) get him some unwanted attention. \n\nI had an ex who constantly wanted to meet people from different countries and was obsessed with asking about it or looking for little signs and asking people if they were from x place to surprise them by being right.

If he's in any true crime Facebook groups, get him out of there now--they're telling him to do this kind of stuff.\n\nI wouldn't read too much into the colleague thing specifically. It's a colleague, and introductions aren't uncommon. Also, I'd clarify if the colleague expressed an interest in meeting.\n\nIf you do talk to the colleague and find out they are also uncomfortable, you may need to see if your bf struggles with social cues in general, because that's a different issue.\n\nI think you need to sit once you're both calm and have an \"I statements\" discussion about this. Set the boundary and stick with it. Obviously, be polite to the people you're introduced to because it's not their fault, but get out of the situation ASAP and do whatever you said you would do if the boundary was crossed.\n\nGood luck!", "OP, you\u2019re not the asshole.

Everyone saying he\u2019s fetishizing you is right.  You didn\u2019t ask him to do that and isn\u2019t listening when you ask him to stop.

It\u2019s not helpful to call everything racist, even if it is not - and this one is not.\n\nEven if white expats live with none-white partners in *their* countries of origin - and I have - it works very similar just the other way around: the none-white partner meets a white person and *of course* will ask them where they are from and introduce them to their partner, if they are from the same country as them; that\u2019s entirely normal and the more normal the smaller the expat community at the place where they live is.\n\nHeck, even my former in-laws asked every white person they crossed paths with (which did not happen often in their city) if they are also from my country, and it was never racist in any way, but just sweet and their version of showing their interest in me and help me feel more at home by making some contacts to people I could speak my language with.", "\u201cEveryone thinks I\u2019m an idiot, which proves that I am a genius.\u201d Keep it up!", ">he will see **random people who looks remotely like me** **and try to speak with them** and introduce me if they turn out to be from my home country. \n\nHe's finding people who look like her.

Just reading the comments and your posting, it sounds a bit like he's gaslighting you after telling him because he ignores you after telling him numerous times you were a shy person and introvert.  The additional part of the equation is that he's only focusing on doing this to you with people who look remotely like you, which to me appears as racial microaggressions.  Just like all Arabs are not Muslims, you will not know everyone that's supposed to be from your country nor have anything in common with them.  He's doing this only for his benefit, not yours, and if he's refusing to ignore giving you any type of respect here after repeated requests, why are you still with him if he's not willing to change?", "He's ignoring you every time you tell him to stop.
