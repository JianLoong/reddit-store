It started as funny incidents; he will see random people who looks remotely like me and try to speak with them and introduce me if they turn out to be from my home country. \n\nI'm a shy person, I don't interact with a lot of people and he knows this. It's a quality of mine that I'm trying to improve on. Which is why I humor him when he does this from time to time. \n\nI tried telling him that I feel embarrassed to come up to random people asking them if they're from the same country (as if racially profiling them). But he keeps doing it, believing that it's nothing malicious, and \"are you not happy to see people from your own country?\". \n\nAnyway, fast forward to today, he's away on a business trip and he knows that he has colleagues who are from my country. I noticed that I had missed calls from him so I called back. Apparently, he was gonna introduce me to his colleague so we can speak together in my native language. \n\nHe's introducing me to a colleague just because we're from the same country!! I just had enough. And I told him to stop randomly introducing me to people just because we're from the same country; it's not funny. \n\nI saw the hurt on his face as he agreed. I feel so bad now.

If he keeps it up, start introducing him to all the white people you know.", "NTA \n\nHe\u2019s being super weird", "NTA you set a boundary and he did not respect that. I understand he may have only had good intentions, but you asked him to stop doing something and he didn't. What you asked was completely reasonable and  it's's good that he seems to finally be stopping now.", "From what has been shared NTA. \n\nNot only is it uncomfortable for you, but the people he is introducing you to who don\u2019t know him (or know him as well) who could take it as being racially motivated. Seems like you not picking up could have been a saving grace as it was involving colleagues I\u2019m guessing he hadn\u2019t met before. \n\nAs for the tone, I\u2019d suggest having a conversation with him to see what wasn\u2019t landing the first (and second and third etc.) times you told him it wasn\u2019t okay for him to do that. Improve conversation now to avoid more awkward interactions later.\n\nEdited for typo", "Dude's a racist, and thinks of you as his exotic girlfriend. It's bad. Run. NTA.", "NTA\n\nHow would he feel if you went up to random white people and done the same thing?\n\nYou done the right thing by telling him to stop.\n\nIf he stops, great. If he doesn't, that's a problem.", "NTA... Doesn't really matter where you are from some people just don't like interacting with strangers. My wife is one of them.", "NTA. You need to start introducing him to every white person you see. Doesn\u2019t matter the number, introduce him to every single one", "\"I saw the hurt on his face as he agreed\"\n\nGood! Nta.", "NTA.  Doesn\u2019t matter what his reasoning is - if you\u2019re uncomfortable with it - it needs to stop.", "No, NTA. I am a foreigner in my husbands country also, and ppl everywhere have taken it as their duty to introduce me to ppl from my country. I really don't care for it either. Thankfully it's not my husband doing this, like yours, so my situation is a lot easier. In your case, you told him over and over, he just does not want to listen. So apparently, you were never clear enough and hopefully the message will sink in after this last comment!", "NAH.  I\u2019m from Italy & am delighted to encounter other Italians.  Unlike most commenters, I don\u2019t think you are a trophy gf nor that he\u2019s being rude.  He just needs to stop & if he doesn\u2019t, then end the relationship since you are so bothered by these actions.  \u262e\ufe0f", "NTA your bf\u2019s racist. See how he likes it when you point out every white guy/girl you see in passing.", "NTA\n\nAnd this is really bizarre. Start hunting out the most degenerate white people you can find (without getting stabbed/etc) and introduce him to them. \n\nOr maybe just stick with shutting it right the hell down.", "NTA.\n\nHonestly, ditch this racist.", "NTA I think your only mistake was humoring him at all. You should have told him from the beginning that you don't want help meeting people and you definitely don't feel the need to specifically meet people from your own country.", "NTA. This feels like he\u2019s making a fetish of your ethnic background and that  that is the main part of you that he sees. \n\nNot cool and truly not a good omen for a long-term relationship.  You deserve to be seen for your character, interests, hopes, and dreams. Not simply your ethnicity.  \n\nThe fact that he keeps doing this to you, despite your discomfort, and then has the temerity to be hurt when you call him on it again, is also not a good sign.", "Yta to yourself for being with a racist. He thinks of you as his exotic girlfriend.", "INFO: Do you have anyone else besides him close? Is your family in your home country? If so do you contact them regularly?", "I suppose this could work. But I'll keep it as a last resort. Thank you! :)", "Oh the OP should totally do this!", "DO THIS", "Correction, all the white people you see.", "Oh, that will be fun.", "If he keeps it up - leave! \ud83d\ude02", "I am indeed scared that people are uncomfortable and some would take offense. I'm bringing this up as soon as I speak with him again. Thank you for the advice!", "Imagine her doing the same. Like every time she sees a white person, she introduces them to her bf.", "Hello! Yes, I have friends here who I get in touch with regularly so I don't really feel lonely. Bored perhaps, since we live in the countryside, but that's another matter. \n\nMy family lives in my home country. But other than my siblings, they are not missed (long story).", "Not excusing his actions but I'll come at this from a different angle.\n\nDo you have any SEA friends? Have you ever mentioned that you felt a disconnect from your culture?\n\nMy girlfriend is a 1.5 generation immigrant and sometimes she can feel like neither culture fits for her.\n\nPerhaps your boyfriend is (misguidedly) trying to \"help\"?", "I have a friend who lives in Czechia and I get in touch her from time to time. She also visited and stayed with us here where I live. \n\nHe literally would ask anyone remotely looking like me. Even if it's an old person whom I'm likely not gonna share any common ground with other than we're from the same country. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou may have a point about him trying to help. But I communicated with him that I am very much an introvert so I prefer to keep to myself. So all he does is make me too uncomfortable.", "I love meeting people organically from my country of origin but its absurd to stop everyone (strangers!?) and ask them if they are from your country? \n Hey whatever country of origin he's from you should ask around every single person if they are from country your bf is from. Of course only when he's around. I know your shy but it would convey the message. \nAnd no NTA", "The fuck is wrong with him? I would expect this from some grandpa, but not a boyfriend ... 'look, honey, this person looks just like you, you should be friends...'", "NTA. What he is doing is racist. I get that it's a \"mild\" form of racism where he is (probably) really into you and you may be the first non-white gf he's had so he is in this honeymoon stage of being totally entranced by everything to do with your country. But it's still annoying and a form of racism. \n\nWhy is it a form of racism? Because: \n\n1. He is acting like your country of origin is the most important thing about you and that you should somehow have a kinship with every single person from your same country. In reality, I would assume that you have a lot of other qualities that would unite you more with people with similar interests. You didn't get to choose where you were born. If he was finding other people who had the same hobby or same job as you to introduce you to, it would at least be something you actively chose to be interested in.\n2. He is constantly pointing out your \"otherness\" by going to talk to every single Asian person to see if they are from the same country as you. He is constantly making a big deal of the one thing that makes you different from him. You don't constantly need to be reminded that you are not from his same country and that you aren't like him. You are not an alien creature looking for those of your same kind. You are just a normal human being who happened to be born in another country.\n\nAgain, I hope I gave you some additional ideas of ways that you could explain to your bf that while he might think what he is doing is cute and charming, you don't like it and he really needs to stop.", "NTA. It sounds like he has no clue that your country is any bigger than a town, and in a town you lived in you know many of the people, so he thinks you will be a friend of a friend of everyone there! \n\nIt would be like you introducing him to random people from anywhere in the US (I am assuming he is from there), thinking he might somehow be connected to them. Absurd, but some people just have no idea how big a country really is.", "You've explained in the past that you are private and shy and would prefer he not do this.  He didn't listen.  Now you've told him in a way that he actually heard, and he's sulking about it.  You set a boundary and are now ensuring he sticks to it.  NTA", "NTA. My husband is an immigrant and I used to try to introduce him to other people that spoke his native language. In my head I thought it would be nice to keep it fresh and connect with someone that might have similar experiences. \n\nHe finally told me he doesn\u2019t understand why everyone immediately introduces him to others that speak his language and expect him to want to speak it. He didn\u2019t specify he was talking about me, but I got the point immediately and haven\u2019t done it again. \n\nIt sounds like your boyfriend didn\u2019t get it the first time when you were trying to be polite, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with asserting your boundaries. It\u2019s possible your boyfriend is well-meaning, but that doesn\u2019t mean your comfort doesn\u2019t matter (or that his actions aren\u2019t racist/coming off as racist)!", "NTA\n\nThat's just all kinds of wrong. Try introducing him to every white person you see on the street, maybe he'll get the picture.", "> the people he is introducing you to who don\u2019t know him (or know him as well) who could take it as being racially motivated\n\nIt very literally and openly *is* racially motivated.", "Maybe he thinks his gf is shy to meet people because it's difficult for her to communicate or find common interests with people? \n\nSo he's trying to be supportive by introducing her to people that she may find easier to get to know, and then maybe make friends with?\n\nHis excitement is probably due to him feeling like he's helping his gf, like a love language. \n\nSure she's told him she doesn't like it and he should've listened to her, but that doesn't make him a racist! \n\nMy god redditors are acting more n more like chronically online tiktokers", "Better yet introduce him to random white people on the street since that what he seems to be doing to you.", "From the post, it sounded as if the reason he was making the introductions was she was trying to become less shy. I may be reading too much into that line admittedly.\n\nI will say that it\u2019s more racially profiling rather than racially motivated. Not that either is okay.", "Does she write like she has difficulty speaking to people?  No.  He's just ignoring her preferences, and doing something that is pretty insensitive and \\*yes\\* borderline racist.", "Oh, so he's trying to fix her by having her talk with her own kind, then, is that it? That sounds SO MUCH BETTER\n\nAnd if serially introducing her to everyone he encounters who may be from the same  region as her TO IMPROVE AND FIX HER is his love language, dude must be deaf.", "Okay, so it's not like you saying you miss your family and he's trying to have you interact with others of you nationality to bridge a gap.  \nYeah that's extremely offensive and I'd definitely talk to him about how it made you feel. His feels may be hurt but nowhere near as bad as yours were.", "I... what?  He was only introducing her to people *of a certain race*.  Also, racial profiling *is* racially motivated.", "Honestly can't believe there's people in this thread trying to excuse this dude. Bet they'd feel differently if their partner were trying to introduce them to random white people on the street to \"help them make friends\"", "Yeah... I was trying to find a potential \"benign\" reason but this one is really hard.\n\nI would never consider doing that to my girlfriend, it feels sort of... Fetishy? Like he's into you _because_ you're SEA, not because you're awesome and happen to be SEA."]}
