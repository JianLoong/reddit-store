About half of it is forested. My family has had this land and managed it for generations at this point and we have kept bees on the land for just as long. There are 3 permanent, managed colonies that we collect honey and other products from and anywhere from 2-6 wild colonies depending on the year.\n\nOnto to the issue. My SIL (Mary, 31F) recently married a man (late 30s?) who has a 12 year son that apparently has an extreme allergy to bees. To the point where he'll die if he doesn't get medical attention. Every year Sally and I host the family 4th of July party since we have the space both inside and out. Mary called last week to tell us we needed to get rid of the bees so that her son can be there. I told her I'm absolutely not doing that. She got really angry and told me I'm excluding my nephew over some insects and that family matters more than them. I told her that if it's such a big issue then she can host or her son can just stay inside. She got huffy and hung up on me. Sally is on my side with this and tried to suggest that maybe my BIL who's an EMT could try and prepare in case something happens.\n\nThis issue has split my wife's family and now my MIL is trying to convince my wife and I to just get rid of them to keep the peace.

AITA?\n\nEdit: No one should worry about me getting rid of them, that's out of the question. I am here to see if I'm a dick for not doing it. I won't be doing it regardless since it's not really feasible short of salting the land and burning it to the ground. Also, to the people wondering why stings occur on a somewhat regular basis at the 4th parties, all the bees on my land aren't the docile Italian breeds loved by beekeepers across the country, they aren't socialized to people since I am basically the only person they encounter for 99% of the year, and between the screaming kids and copious amount of fireworks used (again don't worry I'm friends with my local fire marshal and make sure to check with him about precaution as to not risk burning the place down), the bees get ornery.

That said, here's my advice: \n\n1. Food: Plant native plant species!! Native bees rely on native plant species. Look up generalist vs specialist pollinators. Doug tallamy's book \"nature's best hope\" is a great resource to learn more about the relationship between native plants, native pollinators, and the larger ecosystem as a whole. \n\nReduce the size of your lawn to create more space to plant native plants. Lawns are ecological deserts. Incorporate clover into your lawn to provide additional flowers for pollinators (the widely available clover is not native to the usa, but still supports generalist pollinators). \n\n2: Water: To drink, bees need shallow water with a place to perch. As a simple idea, you can put pebbles in a shallow dish and add water. \n\n3: Shelter: different species use different types of shelter. Some species spend the winter hibernating in hollow stems of plants that senesce (die back) in winter, so one way to help is to not cut back stems in fall. Leave them where they are until spring. Other species of bees use deadwood as habitat, so if you can, add a dead log as a garden feature, or create little \"bee hotels\" to put on your property. \n\n4: Pesticides: Don't use pesticides. If you absolutely must, apply them late in the evening after bees have gone to bed. Try not to apply them to flowering plants. Also consider using contact pesticides (that only work on the bugs they get sprayed on) instead of systemic pesticides (that are absorbed into the plant and stay active for a period of time, which can be years depending on the pesticide). Be very very careful about how you apply them, as it's easy to use them incorrectly and accidentally harm native pollinators. \n\n5: Invasive species: Invasive Chinese mantids eat native pollinators. I have personally witnessed a Chinese mantis sit on a flower and attempt to kill a bumblebee when it landed (I intervened to save the bee). Also, remove invasive plant species when possible and replace with native!", "dude, you don't have a clue what you're talking about. sit down.", "It\u2019s different keeping bees where you have to tend to the hives and being in a garden. OP isn\u2019t asking the kid to come check out the hives or go near them. Fundamentally, they either need to accept the risk of him going outside or he just stays inside. The rare case where allergy kills despite an epi pen is unfortunate but there\u2019s no way to eliminate that risk without depriving him of the outdoors including playgrounds, soccer fields, gardens etc. \n\nHonestly, the only time I\u2019ve had a bee sting me was on a school playground. We were playing lacrosse, I slipped on wet grass and fell on a bee and it stung me. You hope the unspeakable won\u2019t happen but there\u2019s no way to entirely prevent these things", "My choice for the target would be ticks - from what I've read they do not fill an important ecological \"pocket\" and they just profoundly suck (haha).", "> what OP is doing is important to our environment\n\n[Incorrect, at least in North America](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-problem-with-honey-bees/)", "Oh, lucky me...I'm already off to a great start! I live in a redwood forest, and one of the best things about it is letting it be what it wants to be.  (Honestly, there's not much point trying to fight it). Pesticides are useless against the army of insects in my neighborhood. Water is an easy thing...I just need to remember to rinse and refill it, so as to not attract too many mosquitoes. \n\nThere are a couple of local entomologists who can probably give hood advice on habitat options. I think I'll reach out.\n\nThanks for the super helpful info, and great insight on how one's local ecology can make a difference!", "I\u2019m also allergic to bees and this is not something I would ask of someone.", "NTA.\n\nThe kid can't be protected for life.\n\nThe kid has to be taught how to stay away from bees.", "Yes! Let\u2019s destroy the echo system and the bees pollinisation just for a party.\n\nNTA. Do those people even think?", "For real, honestly who cares what your wife's family thinks about your family's property. It's literally none of their beesness", "Agreed. Those parents are in the fine line to child endangerment.\n\nMy whole family has really strong allergies (food mainly) so we take allergy meds before and after every meal we eat outside. Even if we request to have our allergens not touching the food. We also carry the pens just in case. To this day we've sent my dad to the hospital multiple times because some places just won't believe in allergies. We went to an Argentinian meat restaurant and my dad ended up almost dying because some person used the kitchen for seafood. In a damned meat restaurant.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is sometimes, even with TONS of prep, you can still end up in the hospital.", "A million times this. One certification I will always pay to have kept up to date is CPR and first aid. It's invaluable to parents.", "But bees are everywhere in some numbers. OPs property probably doesn't have a higher number of bees flying around as long as you're not next to the hives. \n\nThe guy you're talking to was beekeeping, which is a lot different. You will eventually get stung beekeeping.\n\n\nAnybody with a bee allergy (in my non medical opinion) should go through desensitization, if it's a really serious allergy. The peace of mind would be very comforting I'd think. But ironically, then the best idea afterwards would be to beekeep, to ensure you get occasional stings and keep the sensitivity down.", "Bumblebees hurt like hell and they can sting twice. Only bee I've been stung by.", "That\u2019s\u2026 terrifying.", "I don't think you understand what you're taking about. Have you ever been to an acreage with hives? Ya, didn't think so. I'm", "The epi pen isn't really doing anything about the reaction itself - it's just overpowering the particular symptom that will kill you fast. But adrenaline doesn't have a very long half life so it wears off. My understanding is that the next step they give you is antihistamine, which actually stalls the allergic cascade for the moment, and then often steroids to go home with, which keep the immune system quiet for long enough that the allergen can get fully out of your system.\n\nIt's not unlike how Narcan wears off, so your overdose can come back since most opioids have a longer half life than the antidote - except Narcan is more like the antihistamine and an epi pen is like if you had something that just made you breathe but didn't take away other opiate effects.", "Oh running from these swarms is fun.\n\nAnd finding giant mud dauber nests in the dog house. Heard my friend and dog screaming. They tumbled out followed by what seemed like hundreds of wasps.", "To the genius who downvoted :\n \nYes. I will repeat it there are already enough issues with bee populations disappearing.\n\nI have friend with a very big allergy to bees stings and she is married to a beekeeper.\n\nShe never asked her husband to make the bees leave, she understands that her medical condition is unfortunate, but it\u2019s not more important than the rest of the people, who needs vegetables and fruits to eat.\n\nGet an EpiPen! And grow up!", "I know you said you are not getting rid of the bees. \n\nBut you should do a cost analysis of the cost of removing the bees. The loss of revenue, which before this comment I didn't think of, and then the cost of putting the bees back.\n\nAnyone who says anything negative, give them those three numbers, and ask what percentage of that they are willing to cover to have this kid come over one afternoon.\n\nObviously, NTA.", "My thoughts exactly. Its outside, there is going to be bees. Is this woman planning to run around and kill all of them? I will say she would not need to worry about the boy dying from allergies then but starvation would be a real threat.", "that's like inviting a kid who's deathly allergic to peanuts to a party on a peanut farm lol", "It's not so easy to do that. You can aggravate a bee without realizing it. It's not a risk that somebody allergic to bees should take. I would not bring my child to a place that I know has beehives. I would stay away from that party. However, NTA for keeping the beehives on the property because a visitor is allergic.", "I also have done the desensitizing shots and take a handful of antihistamines every day to keep my immune system in check. \nMy point tho is the OP is still NTA this is for the kid and his parents to manage.  They can host or offer an alternative venue.", "Thankfully I\u2019m not allergic, but two of the three times I\u2019ve been stung, I was standing completely still hoping the bee would fly away\u2014and instead it stung me.

They have signs at all of the entrances stating that this is a peanut-free campus.  They also have EpiPens stashed around campus and the Head of School has written permission to drive the kids to the ER down the street if there's an emergency since that would be faster than calling 911.\n\nLuckily all of the students at the school take the threat very seriously and are very careful so there hasn't been a problem.", "There's a prolific apple farmer who's allergic to apples. He's created a lot of super popular strains and has never been able to taste any of them.", "If we are talking about Honey Bees there are actually invasive and while they may be \u201cendangered\u201d they are harming the native pollinators putting them at a risk.", "Yeah, just one of those things.
