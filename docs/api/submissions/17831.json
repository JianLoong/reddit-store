About half of it is forested. My family has had this land and managed it for generations at this point and we have kept bees on the land for just as long. There are 3 permanent, managed colonies that we collect honey and other products from and anywhere from 2-6 wild colonies depending on the year. \n\nOnto to the issue. My SIL (Mary, 31F) recently married a man (late 30s?) who has a 12 year son that apparently has an extreme allergy to bees. To the point where he'll die if he doesn't get medical attention. Every year Sally and I host the family 4th of July party since we have the space both inside and out. Mary called last week to tell us we needed to get rid of the bees so that her son can be there. I told her I'm absolutely not doing that. She got really angry and told me I'm excluding my nephew over some insects and that family matters more than them. I told her that if it's such a big issue then she can host or her son can just stay inside. She got huffy and hung up on me. Sally is on my side with this and tried to suggest that maybe my BIL who's an EMT could try and prepare in case something happens. \n\nThis issue has split my wife's family and now my MIL is trying to convince my wife and I to just get rid of them to keep the peace.

Pretty entitled of SIL to ask you to give it up forever.", "NTA.\n\nThat's like telling you to get ride of your dog cos the kid's allergic. Both of your suggestions were completely reasonable, and even if you got rid of the managed colonies, there's no guarantee he won't run into one from a missed wild colony. The kid just needs to avoid places wih bees, and that includes your place.", ">\ttried to suggest that maybe my BIL who\u2019s an EMT could try and prepare in case something happens.\n\nOk. Based on this sentence, I\u2019m going ESH. \n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous that they call and demand you get rid of your bees. I am deathly allergic to bees. I would never do this. \n\nBut also, it\u2019s ridiculous to suggest someone who very clearly already does know what to do be prepared. WTF?", "NTA \n\nHoney bees are very important insects and shouldn\u2019t be moved just because a kid that is allergic to them will be at the house a couple times a year. \nPlus, if he\u2019s that allergic, they should have an epi-pen with him at all times anyway. \nThere are way more solutions to this issue than getting rid of the bees. \n\nYour SIL is being horribly unreasonable.", "Tell SIL, MIL, and anyone else who wants the bees gone to simply buzz off!\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Honestly, a well managed farm should have a ton of pollinators even if you aren't 'keeping' bees.  Getting rid of the hives won't change the fact that being on a farm is going to put him in danger.   Also, don't honey bees generally mind their own business unless you directly disturb the hive?", "Nta.  Farms need bees. Do they not carry an epipen? And did the bees sting people at your last events? Ever?", "Nta\n\nThey\u2019re your bees in your property. The kid can sit inside or they can have an epi pen ready.

A person can get stung by a bee walking across a school playground. Or down a leafy street. Or standing in their yard. Does the kid live in a bubble? I doubt it.", "NTA. He can't attend and that's all there is to it. They can host an event themselves if they like.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I am also allergic and carry and EpiPen. If he's that again he should have one. Like op suggested, sil can host or he can stay inside or better yet they don't attend.", "NTA. They are bees, naturally occurring, and you have multiple wild colonies in the locality. As a beekeeper, I am sure you can correct me if I'm wrong but it is my understanding the foraging area around a beehive extends for two miles (3.2 km), and bees are capable of flying 5 miles or more to forage. Even if you have no hives, you would not be able to guarantee the property as risk free for the allergic child.\n\nUnless you have the party right next to the hives, which I can't imagine any beekeeper would even contemplate for risk of upsetting the hive, I can\u2019t see how the fact they are your hives, rather than those of a neighbour, or from a wild colony, would make.\n\nHaving said that, reasonable precautions to stop from disturbing or attracting the bees could be in line. Bee-deterring plants in planters around the party-zone, essential oils sprayed insideand possibly outside) to deter them to for the duration of the party.", "NTA. Some other family member can step up and host in their bee-free backyard. i\u2019m", "NTA- these bees have been on the land longer than you have been alive, they live there, that is their home. More importantly, it's not like you can de-bee all outdoors, there's the wild bees you know about plus some I'm sure you don't. SIL can keep him inside and bring epi-pens or just not attend, her choice.", "NTA. bees won\u2019t really sting unless given a reason to, since they\u2019ll die when they do it. so it\u2019s not really likely he\u2019d be stung anyway unless he was bothering it. hell we had bees living next to our house once and and the only time they ever stung was to my brother when he decided to whack the flowers they were clearly collecting pollen from. if it\u2019s that much of an issue, tell them they can find someone else to host. you shouldn\u2019t have to get rid of your bees. and they\u2019re not \u201cjust insects\u201d, you take care of them and collect honey from them, they\u2019re providing you food. they\u2019re your pets if you wish to call them that. so no, you\u2019re NTA for wanting to keep them", "is this for real? If i were you I would send a her a short but to the point video on SAVE THE BEES, you know the ongoing 10+ yr effort to help our ecosystem. NTA, you could be though, sounds like she deserves it", "NTA. The kids parents are worried, as any parent would be, and they have blown the treat out of proportion in their mind. It's a shame but it  happens all the time. Treat them with compassion but don't back down it's up to them to learn that life has to go on. Bees are everywhere (yay, go bees) at some point they are going to have to deal with it.", "NTA \n\nThose \u201cinsects \u201c are becoming a endangered species and we need them to keep this planet alive\u2026 \n\nI completely understand her concerns of course. But to demand you get rid of something your family had had and done for generations is a big (and rude) suggestion to me. Again.. I understand the concern\u2026 also, the parents should be prepared ANYWAY because bees can be anywhere!! Not just in your land. \nI can\u2019t STAND people who barge in barking out orders or making demands on others that way. It\u2019s rude.\n\nEdited", "NTA - but also\u2026 I too am a bee keeper. Unless you\u2019re going right up onto the hive you\u2019re not going to encounter more bees than anywhere else\u2026 they should have the epipen on them all the time and always be prepared for a sting because bees live everywhere\u2026 it would be different if he lived there full time. \n\nHow many times have people been stung at these parties over the years?", "NTA it is YOUR house and not your kid. \nHow many times a year will they realistically visit? He can stay inside. Worst case scenario somebody can also host (but bees are outside so it might not make any differences). \n\nSIL needs to do her best to protect the kid without going overboard.", "NTA, if it is an issue then someone else can host.", "NTA regardless of the farm being there or not, there will still be bees. Also, if the bees were annoying enough, people wouldnt attend anyway, so i doubt theyre a problem.", "I think they mean bring an epi pen, not read a book...", "Right, I feel for the 12-year-old. That's a scary allergy to have. But he's risking a sting anytime he goes anywhere outside, because bees live all over the place. \n\nQuestion for you and OP as beekeepers - could anything safely sedate the bees a bit during the party? Sorry if that's a silly question - I'm a big fan of little insect friends, but I don't know much about beekeeping.", "There's generally a few stings each year, generally when people go to the garden or when the kids play in the forest near the (usually wild) hives.", "I think that\u2019s even more of a Wtf comment then. Of course someone with a serious allergy would/should have an epipen. And it would make no sense to say an EMT should try to be prepared rather than just suggest the epipen", "Well that would raise concern. However, I\u2019d suggest they host or stay inside like you mentioned. Maybe you could set up some games for the kids inside or out that are further away from the hives. \n\nThere\u2019s gotta be a happy medium. The last thing you want is a dead kid on your hands."]}
