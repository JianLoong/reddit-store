See if BIL can come prepared with an epipen just in case things happen. You could make reasonable accommodations to reduce some amount of risk.

Even if you've got rid of the hives, so you did and they're gone, no more bee colonies, that doesn't mean there won't be a rogue flying bee around and he grabs a flower and gets stung. Or he's running around in the grass Barefoot and he steps on a bee that way. Most of the times I've ever been stung it's by stepping on them when I'm barefoot.

I guess he needs to be careful but they are going way extreme and should have an action planning place if he does get stung and possibly one or two epipens on hand if the worst case scenario happens.
