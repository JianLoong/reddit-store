I, personally, would consider reporting him for this. It's not normal for teachers to do this and you were right to not give him your number, not rude.", "NTA. Teacher is a manipulative creep. Good for you for not falling for his bs. And congratulations on your graduation!", "NTA. Your solution was very reasonable, and the teacher was choosing a very strange condition to apply to this.", "NTA. That\u2019s weird as hell.", "Rude?  I think not, this sounds a bit sketchy and creepy,  You offered a reasonable alternative for which they became terse or rude.  NTA", "NTA. Not at all. It\u2019s kind of creepy. That little spidy sense you got when he asked you that, you need to listen to that always. If something doesn\u2019t feel right it probably isn\u2019t. \n\nI like that it immediately didn\u2019t feel right and you politely declined, but still gave an alternative", "NTA.

No amount of stress justifies this type of behaviour, and if he pesters students for their numbers when stressed and tries to make them feel guilty when they say no, he needs to find a new profession.\n\nNothing about this sounds good, as u/poweller65 has said, he's punishing you.

You get to decide who to use as a mentor, you get to decide who to give out your contact information to. BUT, if this is a person who could help you in school or help you in your career, I would consider it. Set up a separate email address, and use that one just for communication purposes like this. When I was in job training, I would meet up for lunch with anyone who might even have one piece of advice that might help me, and I made sure to mention my motivations for my work. I kept networking even after I started working, and nearly every great job I have ever had has been a result of someone referring me to the person hiring, or emailing me about an opportunity they heard about. And I still keep in touch with people I haven\u2019t worked with in 20 years- I still get emails from people who have been referred by old contacts. \nYou are not obligated to do this- it\u2019s just advice.

My email address is much more reliable right now- it is ___.\u201d Say it with confidence- the only time I get push back is when they didn\u2019t really want to network, they wanted to \u201cnetwork\u201d.", "Cringe!!!! NTA. Teachers should not be doing that!!! And then the old YOU MISSED YOUR CHANCE?! YIKES. Report them to the school AND GOOD FOR YOU WITH YOUR QUICK RESPONSE!!
