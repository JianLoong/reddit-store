She's recently been getting into nail art and she's been using me as her practice client. Today was my girlfriend's (F23) and my two year anniversary, and my niece begged me to let her do my nails for my date. I let her do a simple black coat with some white designs, and it looked very clean and professional.\n\nUnfortunately, my girlfriend has not liked me getting my nails done by my niece before because she says its \"unmasculine, unattractive, and gross.\" However, I really didn't want to break my niece's heart and I like the way she does my nails anyways, so I kept it on. I decided to treat my girlfriend to her favorite restaurant for our anniversary, and she met me there once she got off work. While we were looking at the menus, she noticed the nail polish and got really upset at me for getting my nails done on our anniversary when I know she doesn't like it. I tried to tell her that it's not a big deal, but she got even more upset and left, and didn't even take the necklace I bought her that I knew she had wanted for a while.\n\nI think my girlfriend needs to understand that it's okay for me to wear nail polish especially because it lets me bond with my niece. However, I understand that it might have been a bad move for me to wear it on our anniversary and potentially offend her. AITA?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the sweet comments everyone. My girlfriend went to her friend's house after our date-gone-wrong and called me half an hour ago. She said she's breaking up with me because I am \"toxic and immature for prioritizing my niece's whims over my her needs.\" Well, I am gonna head to Target with my niece to buy some more nail art supplies for her, and maybe a tub of  ice cream for myself so I can at least have a sugar high while I cry myself to sleep tonight.", "created_utc": 1673653780, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10b9icc/aita_for_letting_my_niece_do_my_nails_for_my/", "score": 495, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I guess you dodged a bullet here \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA at all. Reading the update I think you dodged a bullet dude.", "NTA\n\n>Unfortunately, my girlfriend has not liked me getting my nails done by my niece before because she says its \"unmasculine, unattractive, and gross.\" \n\nI was going to say you were also AH for staying with this woman after she said that but your edit shows that the two of you are no longer together.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFocus on the positive: Room in your life for a gf that is not an AH.", "During initial Covid lockdowns my SO decided to grow his hair out. We were LD at the time so I didn\u2019t care. He\u2019s kept it long and now we live together. Do I love it? Nope. Do I color it all the fun colors he wants and sometimes come up with my own ideas for it? Yep. It makes him happy and that makes me happy.", "Just this!  I have a grandson who has liked to wear nail polish since he was very young. My daughter lets him wear nail polish to school. One day, a little girl said you can\u2019t wear nail polish, it\u2019s for girls and he said yes I can and that shut her down . As far as I know, no one else has ever said anything about it. The world is changing, OP\u2019s girlfriend, and maybe you need to catch up.", "My father in law once went to the shop wearing clip on earrings and hair clips as he forgot my girls had been dressing him up", "Sweetie, you have a 6-pack and sweet heart, you're such a catch, your ex was toxic, and please don't let her come back. (She will)", "Yeah, it's such a weird take, I'm a 22yo dude and have had gels on from a pedicure, and have my nails done now and again. It's just another kind of accessory/aesthetic improvement just like any kind of clothing is. OP dodged a bullet here", "So \u2728that's\u2728why he's Superman. Is there anything this man can't do?", "She sounds very immature. It might be better for you to find a better match in the future.\n\nI like it when a man in comfortable enough in his own masculinity to wear og do something typically associated with femininity. It makes me respect him more.\n\nNTA.", "She just chucked away a man who shows great dad potential, is confident in himself, and isn\u2019t bogged down by toxic masculinity? All because you had very common and easily removable stuff on your nails??\n\nSweetheart, you don\u2019t need to cry yourself to sleep, you are going to find someone who will love you for exactly who you are in no time at all! \n\nThat self obsessed girl that\u2019s insecure of a literal child can go find herself a toxic AH who will treat her like dirt with his bare nails!\n\nNTA", "NTA. And please don't cry OP, I know ends of relationships suck but it really does sound like you dodged a bullet here. You will find someone wonderful who will live your niece's nail art as much as you do! Heck, maybe she'll even let your niece practice on her! \nBut I do agree with the ice cream.... Ice cream never hurts!!", "Omg. Wtf. I have a daughter. And if my husband showed up to a date and his nails were painted by her or some other young girl-like niece, sister etc, I would never have loved him more. It's not about the nails. It's about the fact that you're nuturing your nieces interest and not allowing gender constructs to stop that. Super hot. NTA.", "NTA - my Aunt literally tells the story of how she knew my Uncle was \"the one\" because when she came for her first Christmas to meet our family that my Uncle sat there and let me paint his nails sparkly pink and purple...and I was 7 sooo they were a MESS\n\nThis is one of those relationship defining moments that seems so small and mundane (like having the toilet paper roll from the top or the bottom) that later on can become nuclear. Like consider that you have a son who is interested in painting his nails? Or a daughter that wants to play football? This was a great opportunity for you to see what kind of mother (or at the very least aunt to your niece since idk if you want kids) she would be and if that's what you want for your future.", "My daughter painted my at the time 55 yo husbands toenails one night. That night he had a heart attack. The emergency room staff was quite surprised when they yanked off his socks to see pink and purple toes with sparkles. \nGood for you! Glad she dumped you, you deserve better!", "What need does she have that you're not prioritizing by letting your niece do your nails? The need to force you into traditional gender roles?? \n\n\n\nI'm a woman but have wonderful memories of my niece doing my nails when she was young. They looked absolutely terrible but we both loved every second of it and I wore it til it naturally came off. The time you spend doing that with her is so precious. Sorry about the gf but she's not worth forgoing those activities with your niece.", "NTA.    Don't cry.  She's  not worth  it.\nYou sound awesome \ud83d\udc4c", "NTA. and it looks like you dodged a huge bullet. Nothing would have been enough for this girl unless you were a typical jock from a standard teen movie. \n\nYou'd be a great dad btw. Hope you find someone that will appreciate that!", "YTA. Sounds like everything worked out for the best tbh.", "YTA.  Your GF had a known boundary about you getting your nails done and you crossed it again.", "Wearing what?\n\nJandals?\n\nSandals made out of jeans??", "Dude you\u2019re going to look back at this in a year and wonder why you ever put up with her", "That's the spirit!", "My brother and I painted our nails together as kids. Neither of us ever worried about the activity itself being girly, but we did insist that my parents help us find 'boy colors.' He was the coolest kid in school when we found a color we called Ninja Turtle Green.", "Jandals is the New Zealand term for Flip Flops. \n\nThey are the only people who use it from what I understand.", "What if my niece made me the shirt?\n\nYeah, I picked up on the 'my gf is super judgey about men with painted nails' subplot. It's a well composed AITA.", "I'm sure I'll get downvoted some more for this, but if he didn't have **GOTH BLACK & WHITE NAIL POLISH** when he met his girlfriend & now it's ***his thing***, she is perfectly within her rights to break up with him."]}
