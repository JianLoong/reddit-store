Umm...\n\nNTA because just because you are a stay at home parent does not absolve the working parent from doing some household chores.  I don't care what gender anyone is in this story.", "NTA. I understand you're a SAHD but if you cooked the least she could do is wash the dishes. Being the breadwinner doesn't mean *not* contributing to household chores.", "You already did three rounds of dishes and were expected to do a fourth?  WTF?\n\nNTA, they will clearly be there in the morning.  Your physical condition isn\u2019t really relevant here, as there are three other able bodied people who still have a duty to complete chores around the house, of course depending on the kids\u2019 ages.", ">\"how concerned are we about the dishes?\"\n\nImmediately NTA. This is such a passive agressive way of bringing up an issue one might have.", "NTA. I\u2019m the breadwinner in my household and my husband is the primary child/house person. He keeps it all running. And to us, \u201crunning\u201d means functioning, not perfection every moment of every day. Also, if I see something that\u2019s bugging me and I\u2019m there? I do it.", "NTA \n\nUnless you have a bug or rodent problem, the dishes can hang out overnight. Your comment wasn\u2019t the warmest ever, but married couples are allowed to be snippy every so often.", "NTA - As a stay at home Dad you are working just as much as she is - money doesn\u2019t hit your bank account every week but it\u2019s the same concept. \n\nIf you add up the hours I would hazard a guess your hours of work are similar - SO that means when shes home from her work then she gets to jump in on yours\u2026.\n\nIf you have cooked dinner, then why can\u2019t she do the dishes?", "Lolol NTA. I am the breadwinner. I'm also the chef in my house so I feel you. You already did three loads of dishes?! And made dinner and then *gasp* decided to relax for the evening. How dare you. There is nothing wrong with that. Like. Housework is work. You deserve downtime too. Also not loving the passive aggressive approach from your wife. \"How concerned are we about the dishes\" man if someone had asked me that after I'd already done three loads I'd have been feeling petty too.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>my wife poped in and asked, \"how concerned are we about the dishes?\" \n\nUgh, how passive-aggressive. At any rate, being a stay at home parent doesn't mean you have to do literally everything but make the money.", "NTA. As a stay at home parent you work as much as your partner. Leaving the dishes to tomorrow is fine when you are tired, and your wife certainly could have washed them too. But a family of 4 should use a dishwasher, if possible, because there are too many dishes to wash every day.", "Question: how old are your kids? \nBecause it\u2019s about time they do some chores and have responsibilities around the house.\n\nIf I cook the meal, my kids clear the table and wash the dishes.\n\nYou are NTA for your comment about the dishes. \nIt\u2019s easy to make petty comments when you aren\u2019t the one doing the housework.", "NTA  Both you and your wife have full time jobs but you do not receive pay for it.  Once the working spouse comes home everything should be a team effort.  When I was a stay at home parent I usually cleaned up the kitchen while my husband bathed the kids.  I got a break from the kids and he had one on one time.  Anything else that needed to be done we shared.  We are still married 41 years later because we always worked together.  It sounds like your wife needs to realize it is also her responsibility to help out when she gets home.", "NTA\n\nThe breadwinner fallacy is no longer relevant regardless of gender. You are the partner in the household contributing to a better life for the family. You are not a servant or employee whose performance is up for review.", "NTA. The house is your turf - you can do the dishes in the morning and she can do them whenever she wants if they bother her. I am not sure why, but stay-at-home parents are bossed around like that way too often.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What are we supposed to be worried about? The dish goblin will come steal all the dirty dishes?", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nLeaving some dishes over night is not a real problem. If you are in charge of the house and keep on top of it then she really has no business in worrying over it.\n\nIf it was the other way around people would lynch any man suggesting his stay at home wife didn't do the dishes quickly enough.", "NTA\n\nYou did good, tomorrow will be another day.", "Ultimately, it's between you two and what the agreement was for how you as a couple wanted to divide and conquer household tasks. But I am going ESH because both her way of asking and your answer were passive-aggressive and not going to make any of this better.", "Info: how old are your kids? I feel like, depending on their age, it changes my opinion a bit.", "NTA. \n\nYou gave a frank and honest response. \n\nAnd the breadwinners stuff is just bullshit. If one person runs the home and is expected to do the majority of the housework, that means they also get to manage how those things get done. You don't get to tell your wife \"how concerned are we with those TPS reports\", so she shouldn't be asking about the dishes. \n\nI do get that it is different. In the home, everyone has a say in what a clean home means, but that doesn't mean they get to boss their partner around about it. For example, we can agree the bathroom needs to be mopped once a week, but if I am not the one mopping, I don't get to decide it is every Sunday, nor do I get to get upset if we go to the 8th day once in awhile.\n\nAnd just because you are the STAP doesn't mean you clean everything all of the time. If she is bothered by dishes in the sink, she can do them, and at the very least she can have some respect for you as a partner and not raise it like a passive aggressive office boss.", "NTA. When I was a SAHM, my husband and I treated it as his work was outside the home, mine was inside, but the same hours. In the evening/weekends/holidays child and house responsibilities split 50/50 (obviously with some flexibility in there). Your job looking after the home and family is as important as hers in terms of the family unit. Really cooking and cleaning up after the evening meal should be split between you.", "NTA. The SAHParent usually cooks at least three meals a day for several people, and that comes with at least three loads\u2019 worth of dishes. It\u2019s not shocking to expect help with at least one of those in a single day.\n\nHer comment was totally uncalled for and very passive aggressive. Does she realise she would be doing ALL that cooking and cleaning on her own if you weren\u2019t there to hold down the household front ?", "NTA-I am in a similar position except my kids are dogs.  I have had to give my wife the \u201cknock it off\u201d conversation as I call it when she made more than a couple quips about small things around the house I didn\u2019t prioritize when she was completely ignore all the work I was doing. It was especially frustrating when I had to tear the bathroom down to the studs and redo it because of water damage from a bad shower wall.\n\nI finally sat her down and asked her to help me out if she wanted to or stop with the comments.  I said if she was going to nitpick stuff I was going to find a job that fit my disability and go back to work full time and things would go back to the way they were when I was in.  She really didn\u2019t want that because of the dogs being home and since the jobs available for me would be a farther drive she would have to take time for the weekday tasks including taking her dad to medical appointments, dogs to the vet/groomers.  Also I would stop all renovations I am doing to the house.\n\nNeedless to say she stopped.", "NTA \n\nAnd you are welcome to show the post to your wife. I was a SAHM for a few years and I much much prefer having a job . Being home is stressful and a lot of work. \nEveryone expects you to help for everything. \nYour wife asked a question in a very passive aggressive manner and that\u2019s not ok. \nThe one and only time my husband dared to ask me why something was messy I gave him a broom, mop and vacuum cleaner and walked out the door to take a walk. Left the 2 babies at home. \nHe never complained again. \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut it is time to evaluate work roles. Just because you are a SAHD does not mean the partner does absolutely nothing, you have also been working all day. After they come home housework gets divided. How much does your wife contribute at home? \nDepending on ages of the kids you also need to get them involved in the house tasks.", "Yeah, that was pretty condescending, wasn't it?", "I've been the main bread winner for decades. Last night I cooked dinner for the 4th time this week. I'm not concerned about the dishes. \"We\" certainly aren't! If I was, I'd do them. Or I'd deputise one of our beloved offspring to do them. \n\nEveryone in the house needs to pull their weight, regardless of their external commitments. Because, you know, adulting?\n\nPassive aggressive condescending comments like this are never acceptable. I'd be infuriated if my husband spoke to me so disrespectfully.

Either way it rubbed me wrong", "If the dirty dishes are a \"concern\" she is more then welcome to just start washing.

Like if it bothers you go ahead.", "Yeah I start at 6am and we usually eat around 6pm  so I'm on \"shift\" solo for about 9 hours before she gets home at 4.

Because if my military disability I do also provide just under half our income.", "This is what I was thinking. Why can\u2019t the kids do it? I remember having a little step stool to stand on before I became tall enough, lol. Us kids were doing dishes before we could even reach on our own!", "Kids are 1,4&14. 4 and 14 yo do have age appropriate household chores. The oldest is in the process of learning all things house duty so I don't often make him do dishes.", "Right. The other day I was saying to someone. I refuse to be on my deathbed wondering why I didn't do more dishes when I could be playing with my kids.", "I had two friends in school that left a pot of pasta and meat sause in the sink for several months because they couldn't agree on who was supposed to clean it. When I saw it that was the only time I was concerned bout dishes.", "Fair enough", "Oh I answered this down a ways. But 1,4,14", "You have every right to establish a more reasonable level of duty for everyone towards housework. \n\nI am more concerned about how you are characterizing yourself in this. I would recommend therapy, both mental and physical. You should be able to find a fulfilling outlet outside the home, even if it isn\u2019t employment.", "How old are the kids?", "Yo, that's nasty.", "Okay. I don't think you're an asshole for what you said. You made dinner and I'm frankly of the mind that the person who made dinner should never really have to do the dishes afterwards (at least not the day OF) because that's exHAUSTING. \n\nEspecially considering you're disabled (same, ik the struggle) and have to manage your energy with that in mind. I think you were a little snarky but lol, it'd been a day and your wife's question was little weird considering you mostly run the household and she could've asked your 14 year old if she was really concerned. Like you said, you weren't concerned, you were even planning to do it but if it really bothered her, she could do something herself, which I'm sure she didn't want to do (being tired), which is why she got irritated. But that's fair for you to say, for the reasons I already said. \n\nI do have something in the terms of advice for you, 'cause I've been in situations juggling household shit like this before, but I don't want to share it without asking to see if you want it first. Interested? Or no?"]}
