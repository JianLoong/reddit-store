I am the breadwinner. I'm also the chef in my house so I feel you. You already did three loads of dishes?! And made dinner and then *gasp* decided to relax for the evening. How dare you.

In the home, everyone has a say in what a clean home means, but that doesn't mean they get to boss their partner around about it.

I said if she was going to nitpick stuff I was going to find a job that fit my disability and go back to work full time and things would go back to the way they were when I was in.  She really didn\u2019t want that because of the dogs being home and since the jobs available for me would be a farther drive she would have to take time for the weekday tasks including taking her dad to medical appointments, dogs to the vet/groomers.

This was her telling you indirectly that she wanted them to be done. Just because she is the breadwinner spouse does not mean she isn't responsible at all for the home. I'd say the same exact thing if the roles were reversed.

Like, you live in that house too you should also have to contribute SOME of the chores. Doing dishes for the night won't kill you. The breadwinner still eats don't they? They still use clothes and use the house. They should have to also contribute to household chores because it takes a house full of people to make that mess. \n\nI am a stay at home, and it is exhausting the amount of stuff that needs to get done in any given day. There are daily tasks, every other day tasks, weekly tasks and monthly tasks. Not to mention emergency tasks that pop up, especially with kids, and then appointments, errands, groceries, etc etc. I get that people who work outside the house also do a lot of work, but their work stops at the end of the day.

That's an extremely passive aggressive and condescending way to bring it up.", "NTA!!!\n\nThis makes me so made on your behalf.\n\nI had a situation with my husband almost exactly like this. There were TONS of dishes because I was sick for a few days. I did 2 loads and unloaded by myself because my kids were in school (it's usually their job to unload the dishwasher). \n\nAnd then I made a new meal that dirtied a lot of dishes. So after dinner I sat down to craft and relax. Well once husband came up to go to bed he was very upset the kitchen was such a mess.\n\nI then angrily did the dishes and cried while he was in bed. Once I was done I got in bed and didn't talk to him the rest of the night. \n\nThe next day he asked why I was so upset and cranky the night before and so I told him. He did apologize because he didn't realize I did so many loads that day and I apologized for giving him the cold shoulder.

I noticed the dishes from dinner are undone still, but you usually do them by this time. Is something wrong? I don\u2019t mean to necessarily imply that you should hop and do them or that you are somehow shirking or to give the impression that what I have noticed is your usual pattern has become an expectation in any way, but it seems unusual. Have you forgotten or is something else going on? Would you like me to do them instead? Tonight? Or in general? Or are you soaking them or something like that and me going in would mess you up? I respect that this is sort of your domain right now, and I don\u2019t mean to question you, but if this is purposeful, is that going to be problematic? Are you okay okay?

Those kinds of issues are super common.  But you could both maybe work on it. \n\nBut yes, get your kids involved with the house more.  It won't save you work, tbh; teaching them to do it properly will be more work, and they may need you there and participating to keep them motivated.

It is odd to expect you to spend your time together serving and cleaning. When both adults are home, the responsibilities are split evenly. When kids get old enough, they help. Does she do her share around the house?\n\nOn another note, why is your wife making a passive aggressive comment instead of communicating expectations (even of the expectations are unreasonable)?
