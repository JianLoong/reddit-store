The majority of the time, we hang out at my place, the \"Launch Pad\".  My place was chosen because I have a pool (an apartment pool, I'm not that fancy), it's pretty central, and it has the biggest kitchen so it's where we usually decide to do the group's cooking.  I would say that usually 8-12 people come to most things, and the core group is maybe like 20 of us?  All dating back to college.\n\nThere are a few people in the group I don't get along that well with, but whatever, they're part of the group.  I still invite them.  However, last night (Saturday night), something weird happened.  One of the people who doesn't like me much, Jordan, was acting like a space case and wasn't responding to anything I said.  It actually lead to him burning the group's nachos because he ignored my directions to take them out of the oven.  The fire alarm went off and everything.\n\nI found out through another group member that Jordan decided he is not going to acknowledge my existence anymore because he doesn't like me.  To be clear, Jordan and I have never had any kind of argument or fight.  I asked Jordan if this was the case and he wouldn't even respond.  This man had the gall to come to my home as my guest, cook food in my kitchen, nearly cause a fire, and then refuse to speak to me!\n\nI told Jordan to get out of my apartment if he wasn't willing to speak to me in my own home.  Jordan, to his credit, complied and left immediately, grinning smugly like a Cheshire Cat after filling my place with burnt nacho smoke.  Jordan's good friend Amber (who isn't my biggest fan either, apparently) said I was being \"a controlling bitch\" and also left with him.  I also booted Jordan out of the Launch Pad group chat, which has sparked a serious controversy amongst my friends because it's where all the group planning for my place takes place.\n\nAnyway, it's escalated, and the group is split.  Half of our friends seem to think it's fine that I removed Jordan (both IRL from my house and from the Launch Pad chat), because he was at my house and refusing to even interact.  The other half think that Jordan is a longstanding group member and I should just put up with him ignoring me and continue to invite him even if he doesn't like me because he's been part of the group a long time and he didn't choose my house as the home base.\n\nSo I'm wondering, AITA for booting someone that won't speak to me from my own house when I'm the central hub for our friends?", "created_utc": 1667772020, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yo484m/aita_for_kicking_outuninviting_a_guy_that_gave_me/", "score": 603, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If GSF1 exists in sufficient concentration \u2014 and it usually does \u2014 it is impossible to expel a person who actively detracts from every social event\n\nGSF 4: Friendship is transitive\n>GSF4 is the belief that any two of your friends ought to be friends with each other, and if they\u2019re not, something is Very Wrong ... A more serious form of GSF4 becomes another \u201cfriendship test\u201d fallacy: if you have a friend A, and a friend B, but A & B are not friends, then one of them must not really be your friend at all\n\nGSF 5: Friends do everything together\n>GSF5, put simply, maintains that every friend in a circle should be included in every activity to the full extent possible\n\nIn this case, you've ended up with a pretty toxic combo of \"we're all friends here even if you dislike someone, because my friend is also your friend\" and \"we've been doing it this way for X years so if you change that You Are Wrong even if provoked\".\n\nI really do think it would be worth reconsidering how you want these hangouts to work \u2013 maybe hit pause on some of the big group ones until everyone's got their heads on straight again and figure out what boundaries you want to draw. Just because your friends are friends with someone and you've hung out with them in the past, it doesn't mean you have to keep hosting them on a regular basis just because it's convenient for everyone else! We've all done it, I've done it too, just to keep the peace, but this regularly? Yikes, that's a lot. Maybe it's time to cut down the frequency, or focus on smaller hand-picked groups for a while.", "NtA but this sounds like high-school drama.", "NTA; you have the right to invite who you like to your home.

A few other people stopped coming when he did, but the rest were relieved the awkwardness ended.", "Suggest the next group get together be at his place; but people don\u2019t have to give him money because he doesn\u2019t believe in it.", "I can\u2019t believe the audacity he has in even showing up being it\u2019s well known he doesn\u2019t like you. He\u2019s the asshole right there. Then to treat you- the host- whose house he is standing in so badly is insane. Then to top it off 1/2 the group says everyone should just put up with his behavior. That\u2019s the big issue right there- the world has been putting up with \u201cthe jordans\u201d behavior and we all need to put a stop to all of them quickly and decisively. NTA", "Just close the chat group an block his supporters. Nta", "NTA. \nNo way, no how!!!\n\nYou should not have to \u2018put up with\u2019 someone disrespecting you in your own home. \nI think Jordan intended on burning the food. \nNow, kicking him out of the group chat may not have been cool, but if ALL gatherings are at your place, there\u2019s no need to include him because he\u2019s not invited to your place. \nWho exactly is telling you to just put up with being disrespected? Can you have a private chat with them? \n\nThere was no reason for Jordan to give you the silent treatment and frankly your FRIENDS let you down. Right there, in real time as it was happening. They should\u2019ve stood up for you and told him to stop being a jerk. \n\nPlease stop hosting parties at your place. \nLet someone else do the work.", "NTA.  He blatantly disrespected you in YOUR home, he deserved to be kicked out.  If he wants to act like a child, he can be treated like one.  And if he's never going to be allowed in your place again, and I hope he's not, there's no reason for him to be in the chat to plan events at your place.  The rest of them can hang with him elsewhere and plan it without your input.", "NTA \u201cLook guys, Jordan has made it very clear he does not like me. It\u2019s completely okay that I\u2019m not his favorite person, I accept that. However, I am not comfortable hosting someone who is outwardly rude to me in my home. If someone else would like to host future gatherings, I\u2019m absolutely okay attending events he\u2019s invited to. I have no issue with him. I\u2019m just not comfortable having someone who doesn\u2019t like me to the point they would rather pretend I don\u2019t exist in my space. Thank you for understanding.\u201d", "NTA Tell those that want you to put up with such a rude AH that they can begin hosting events at their place instead if they want him to be a part of the group so badly. No one should have to tolerate that kind of rudeness in their own home.", "NTA and you have shitty friends who are using you and your place. Edit.  I didn't see that others are covering their extra costs.  Jordan is still a colossal jerk.", "NTA", "> Half of our friends seem to think it's fine that I removed Jordan (both IRL from my house and from the Launch Pad chat), because he was at my house and refusing to even interact. \n\n\"Launch Pad group chat and invitation to my personal house has to be based on mutual respect of one another.  Jordan simply isn't willing to participate in mutual respect.  I completely understand if some of you disagree with this and I fully support you starting another chat group that includes Jordan and you have a second meeting place that isn't my house where you all meet.   You are all adults and I respect your boundaries and your choices that even when they don't include me.  Next Launch Pad meet is on Tuesday I hope to see everyone still in the group there!  Its Taco Tuesday!  Jenn is bringing White Claw and Noah is bringing the sunscreen.  Tacos, hard seltzer, and sun all on Tuesday for Launch Pad members!\"\n\nNTA", "You can kick anyone out of your apartment that you don't want to be there. Someone else can host if they want Jordan there. He's a tool. NTA.", "nta and you need better friends. He is very entitled.", "NTA - someone disrespects you like that needs to be removed and barred from ever coming again.\n\nSince the Launch Pad, is the group chat for planning gatherings at your home and he will not be allowed to come to your home again, there is no need for him to be in the group chat.\n\nIf people continue to harass you to include him and just say just to ignore him.  Either they can accept that he will not be coming and if they are not happy then someone else needs to take over the hosting responsibility.", "Nta\n\nTime to thin the heard within your friend group. I had a Halloween party at my house last weekend let me say I\u2019ll be doing the same as I recommend. Adults are exhausting!", "NTA, he is no long invited why do they think he needs to be in the group that plays events at your place?", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry but you have a lot of immature friends if any of them agree that acting like a child should be rewarded.", "NTA\n\nYou are liable for your guest\u2019s behavior. If he\u2019s willing to disregard your basic safety instructions in your home and cause a fire, then it\u2019s not safe to have him as a guest. He can go cause fires where he\u2019s liable for the damages, or be a guest where he\u2019ll respect his host and be a safe guest.", "NTA. Not liking you is one thing, but disrespecting you and potentially catching your house on fire is another. My guess is this was all planned in his head to make you look like the bad guy so you would be kicked out of the group. Maybe not the exact scenario but directing things to make you look bad.. like 'how could I have done anything wrong? I didn't even say a word to OP.' Why else would he smile at you as he left?", "I wish I had had the courage to kick out the person who was giving me the silent treatment on Christmas day. It was absolutely soul destroying.", "NTA. It's your place and you can invite or disinvite who you want. What are you going to do, tell everyone \"you're all invited, but not you, Jordan\" every time you have an event?", "NTA\n\nRefusing to speak to your host?

This seems like age 11 shit tbh", "NTA but drop anyone who justifies his rudeness and childishness. He set off the smoke alarm in your house out of sheer rudeness.

NTA.", "\u2026 Y\u2019all are full grown adults and they\u2019re acting like middle schoolers\u2026? What in the hell? NTA. This is cliquey and weird. I\u2019d cut your losses. They\u2019re long past their prime of mental development. It only goes downhill from here.", "If they want him to remain part of the group they can start hosting these get togethers. NTA. Your home your rules.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your home. It\u2019s literally the one place where you should never ever be ignored - it\u2019s YOUR HOME.\n\nWhile the two of you don\u2019t need to interact as part of the group, he was outright ignoring you to the point of letting nachos burn and set off your fire alarm. This was openly hostile and NOT something anyone should ever tolerate in their home. \n\nLet the group know that if they are ok with someone completely ignoring and disrespecting someone else\u2019s home, that they are welcome to host and no longer take advantage of your home.", "He decided to give you the silent treatment. Is he eight years old?", "NTA Id have done the same though I think he was egging you on for this", "NTA", "NTA. Anyone that thinks you should be totally disrespected in your home isn\u2019t welcome either.", "You did yourself a favor. He is as sad as they come. If I don\u2019t speak to someone I don\u2019t regularly go to their premises.", "NTA, it sounds like someone shoved a tampon up Jordan's ass and lit it on fire, and he's blaming you for that.", "Nta he can\u2019t come to your house and ignore you what insane childish logic is this??? Your friends have to grow up too if they think that makes any sense", "NTA\n\nIt is completely reasonable to not welcome someone in to your home who has not only chosen to ignore you, but also created a potential safety hazard.\n\nI\u2019m astounded anyone thinks his behavior here should be excused and he should still be welcome to your home just because he\u2019s been around for a while.\n\nThis guy also looks like he was trying to pick a fight.", "NTA. im suprised its lasted this long. ppl change, friendships change, especially friendships that begin in HS and Uni. I had alot of fun with my HS and Uni friends, but as a adult, i have nothing in common with most of them, no reason for you to have someone you do not like hanging around your home", "NTA\n\nJordan needs to get himself some big boy pants.", "NTA, a guest cannot be openly hostile to the host and expect not to be asked to leave.", "He is an extremely rude AH.  But you have to decide if it's worth ruining your cool group.  Personally, I'd say good riddance to anyone who thought that was okay.", "NTA but Jordan is.", "NTA. Nope, he doesn\u2019t get to be disrespectful to you in your own home. What\u2019s wrong with the ppl in the group who think his behavior is ok? I\u2019d invite them to leave the group as well. How dare they be so dismissive of you.", "NTA. It\u2019s your home and you should only invite the people you want it. Some is the folks who support Jordan should just go hang at his place!", "Drop the Launch Pad group chat. Invite others to host the gatherings. \n\nStart a new chat with those who supported you against Jordan, and respect that this is your home\u2026 not an ongoing party venue. \n\nInvite them over privately as a thank you.", "NTA", "NTA, mostly\n\nTotally OK to kick him out of your home for being rude to you, not OK to remove him from a group chat. \n\nIt would be OK to let the group know that your house has a no asshole rule.", "It says they've all known each other for years, it's even why some of the friends thing OP should just let Jordan keep coming over.", "NTA it\u2019s more than his house. If you were hosting every week, this is your event. \n\nIf it was me, I\u2019d let the group split in half keep the invite open for anyone, set ground rules, and invite new folks you want to grow the group with.", "This is the first thing I thought of too. Still quite relevant today.", "I was so coming here to say this. I dont know anyone in their 20s and 30s who have that large of a group of friends that all hang out together. That's pretty unusual to me. NTA", "Q", "It\u2019s so rude to enter someone\u2019s home and then so purposely ignore them. Like, at least put the pettiness aside when you\u2019re in their freaking house.", "So Jordan's an idiot, you weren't the a-hole before that, that's just the cherry on top. Tell whomever has a problem with it, they can hang out at Jordan's if they want, but you have zero obligation to allow someone that... ridiculous into your home to sponge off of you. NTA", "WTELF. Did he show any chagrin, any self-awareness after having this all explained to him?\n\nNTA to say the least, but seriously, is he a trust fund baby or something? He is way too old to be this oblivious to reality", "This is actually very cool for you. There was a toxic presence that decided to literally start a fire to indicate they no longer wished to hang out. And now you never have to invite them again, it would be weird if you did.", "Why do you care what Jordan thinks? Why do care what the other half of your friend group thinks?\n\nHe could\u2019ve burnt down your house because he wanted to play childish games. Then he smiles. Nope.", "NTA. This sounds like a man who's never had to pay for his own stuff so he has no clue just how expensive it is to consistently replace things your guests have used, ESPECIALLY if it's a frequent thing.  He's a spoiled brat, clearly proven by his use of the silent treatment. Last I checked, that's something a 12 year old does, not a grown man. Does he live with his parents?", "Bribing you for what? I mean seriously, do you have something to be bribed for or is Jordan a bit off?", "that is one not sharp puppy.", "Bribing you for what? Lord. And it\u2019s not like you were making him give you money. He\u2019s\u2026ugh", "NTA\n\nJordan should have brought the issue up. Doing silent treatment and almost causing a fire are AH move on his part. \n\nJordan is probably the missing stair of the group.", "Wtf is wrong with this kid?", "I'm 35 and I literally have 3 friends I talk to every day. I can barely maintain those friendships.", "so your place of residence should be avaiable at someones whim? Wow....keep jordan and amber away.", "Good lord, what an entitled child.  If he wants more say over parties, he can host them himself at his own place, paying for everything himself.  I think you're not losing anything by cutting him out.  (NTA, btw)", "Just send the group chat this link and tell them the line has been drawn in the sand!", "Jordan sounds like he has a very loose hold on reality", "Jordan still seems to think I am some kind of mafia don, but for our social group. Jordan seems to think that I am compelling people to make these payments, or something like that.  If I was doing that I'm doing a pretty poor job because I'm not even recovering all my costs.", "WTELF\u2014what the elevated level f?", "idk, I don\u2019t think a trust fund baby would get bent out of shape over a few bucks here and there. I bet it\u2019s the opposite\u2014I bet he\u2019s poor.", "I was waiting for Captain Awkward Terminology to drop in. Perfect Example of the idea.", "Same im 27, and anymore than like 4 or 5 and I can't do it haha.", "I'm 20 and same for me haha", "OMG, it would be so awesome if your were a mafia don! Also a little scary, but still more awesome. Imagine what all you could do to intimidate him. The possibilities are endless! \n\nDoesn\u2019t surprise me that he prefers to stick with being stupid. His whole behavior screams immature and attention seeking. \n\nGood on you for kicking him out of the house and the chat!", "Jordan sounds jealous that he is not the centre of the group. He feels like he should be, and so tries to disparage you. Immature and insecure, but sadly too common.", "Time to Venmo him for the burnt nachos \ud83d\ude0e", "Jordan and Amber should start hosting. Period. Tell the group that you are fine with not being the \u201claunch pad\u201d any more. If your place is the coolest it will be a non starter. \n\nI would 100% expect an apology before having him back over. That\u2019s crazy.", "I think that means what the ever loving fuck", "ever lovin'. :D", "the exact opposite is true in my experience. poor people don\u2019t care about the 3.27 they paid for your coffee, but a rich trust fund baby will lose sleep over it.", "Amen! Wish I was friends with a mafia don\ud83d\ude0e", "Have some of your friends kiss your ring (visibly) when they greet you.\nPlay it up big.\nMaybe make someone an offer they can't refuse.\n\nWhat other *Godfather* actions could you do?", "Right.  Poor people realize things cost money and if one person hosts they shouldn\u2019t have to bear the financial cost of it all.  It was always my more well off friends who never thought about something like that.", "You and me both!", "Yes! Same. I really don\u2019t keep \u201ccomfortable\u201d (rich) friends anymore after having quite a few experiences like that."]}
