I would say that usually 8-12 people come to most things, and the core group is maybe like 20 of us?  All dating back to college.\n\nThere are a few people in the group I don't get along that well with, but whatever, they're part of the group.  I still invite them.  However, last night (Saturday night), something weird happened.  One of the people who doesn't like me much, Jordan, was acting like a space case and wasn't responding to anything I said.  It actually lead to him burning the group's nachos because he ignored my directions to take them out of the oven.  The fire alarm went off and everything.\n\nI found out through another group member that Jordan decided he is not going to acknowledge my existence anymore because he doesn't like me.  To be clear, Jordan and I have never had any kind of argument or fight.  I asked Jordan if this was the case and he wouldn't even respond.  This man had the gall to come to my home as my guest, cook food in my kitchen, nearly cause a fire, and then refuse to speak to me!\n\nI told Jordan to get out of my apartment if he wasn't willing to speak to me in my own home.  Jordan, to his credit, complied and left immediately, grinning smugly like a Cheshire Cat after filling my place with burnt nacho smoke.  Jordan's good friend Amber (who isn't my biggest fan either, apparently) said I was being \"a controlling bitch\" and also left with him.  I also booted Jordan out of the Launch Pad group chat, which has sparked a serious controversy amongst my friends because it's where all the group planning for my place takes place.\n\nAnyway, it's escalated, and the group is split.  Half of our friends seem to think it's fine that I removed Jordan (both IRL from my house and from the Launch Pad chat), because he was at my house and refusing to even interact.  The other half think that Jordan is a longstanding group member and I should just put up with him ignoring me and continue to invite him even if he doesn't like me because he's been part of the group a long time and he didn't choose my house as the home base.\n\nSo I'm wondering, AITA for booting someone that won't speak to me from my own house when I'm the central hub for our friends?", "created_utc": 1667772020, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yo484m/aita_for_kicking_outuninviting_a_guy_that_gave_me/", "score": 183, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If GSF1 exists in sufficient concentration \u2014 and it usually does \u2014 it is impossible to expel a person who actively detracts from every social event\n\nGSF 4: Friendship is transitive\n>GSF4 is the belief that any two of your friends ought to be friends with each other, and if they\u2019re not, something is Very Wrong ... A more serious form of GSF4 becomes another \u201cfriendship test\u201d fallacy: if you have a friend A, and a friend B, but A & B are not friends, then one of them must not really be your friend at all\n\nGSF 5: Friends do everything together\n>GSF5, put simply, maintains that every friend in a circle should be included in every activity to the full extent possible\n\nIn this case, you've ended up with a pretty toxic combo of \"we're all friends here even if you dislike someone, because my friend is also your friend\" and \"we've been doing it this way for X years so if you change that You Are Wrong even if provoked\".\n\nI really do think it would be worth reconsidering how you want these hangouts to work \u2013 maybe hit pause on some of the big group ones until everyone's got their heads on straight again and figure out what boundaries you want to draw. Just because your friends are friends with someone and you've hung out with them in the past, it doesn't mean you have to keep hosting them on a regular basis just because it's convenient for everyone else! We've all done it, I've done it too, just to keep the peace, but this regularly? Yikes, that's a lot. Maybe it's time to cut down the frequency, or focus on smaller hand-picked groups for a while.", "NtA but this sounds like high-school drama.", "NTA; you have the right to invite who you like to your home.

It is your home, your safe space and you don't invite your enemies into it to ignore you, set food on fire and smirk at you.

That absolutely won't be happening, nobody will be hosting events at my place without me present.  I'd be fined by my apartment complex for doing this as well.\n\nJordan is also apparently upset that I would not take suggestions for a themed event (I made three decor suggestions to be voted on, because I was paying for the decor and had found the options already) for a party I hosted for someone else in the group's birthday.  Jordan felt people should have been able to vote for the initial decor picks (instead of me picking them) because it was a \"community birthday\", despite me paying for and keeping the decorations for future parties at... my apartment.

The people backing him apparnetly agree with his attitude. You need to stop that immediately or it\u2019s going to be a continuous issue with him or not.\n\nIf they want more control over things they can host or rent actual rentable places.
