My place was chosen because I have a pool (an apartment pool, I'm not that fancy), it's pretty central, and it has the biggest kitchen so it's where we usually decide to do the group's cooking.  I would say that usually 8-12 people come to most things, and the core group is maybe like 20 of us?  All dating back to college.\n\nThere are a few people in the group I don't get along that well with, but whatever, they're part of the group.  I still invite them.  However, last night (Saturday night), something weird happened.  One of the people who doesn't like me much, Jordan, was acting like a space case and wasn't responding to anything I said.  It actually lead to him burning the group's nachos because he ignored my directions to take them out of the oven.  The fire alarm went off and everything.\n\nI found out through another group member that Jordan decided he is not going to acknowledge my existence anymore because he doesn't like me.  To be clear, Jordan and I have never had any kind of argument or fight.  I asked Jordan if this was the case and he wouldn't even respond.  This man had the gall to come to my home as my guest, cook food in my kitchen, nearly cause a fire, and then refuse to speak to me!\n\nI told Jordan to get out of my apartment if he wasn't willing to speak to me in my own home.  Jordan, to his credit, complied and left immediately, grinning smugly like a Cheshire Cat after filling my place with burnt nacho smoke.  Jordan's good friend Amber (who isn't my biggest fan either, apparently) said I was being \"a controlling bitch\" and also left with him.  I also booted Jordan out of the Launch Pad group chat, which has sparked a serious controversy amongst my friends because it's where all the group planning for my place takes place.\n\nAnyway, it's escalated, and the group is split.  Half of our friends seem to think it's fine that I removed Jordan (both IRL from my house and from the Launch Pad chat), because he was at my house and refusing to even interact.  The other half think that Jordan is a longstanding group member and I should just put up with him ignoring me and continue to invite him even if he doesn't like me because he's been part of the group a long time and he didn't choose my house as the home base.\n\nSo I'm wondering, AITA for booting someone that won't speak to me from my own house when I'm the central hub for our friends?", "created_utc": 1667772020, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yo484m/aita_for_kicking_outuninviting_a_guy_that_gave_me/", "score": 5512, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If GSF1 exists in sufficient concentration \u2014 and it usually does \u2014 it is impossible to expel a person who actively detracts from every social event\n\nGSF 4: Friendship is transitive\n>GSF4 is the belief that any two of your friends ought to be friends with each other, and if they\u2019re not, something is Very Wrong ... A more serious form of GSF4 becomes another \u201cfriendship test\u201d fallacy: if you have a friend A, and a friend B, but A & B are not friends, then one of them must not really be your friend at all\n\nGSF 5: Friends do everything together\n>GSF5, put simply, maintains that every friend in a circle should be included in every activity to the full extent possible\n\nIn this case, you've ended up with a pretty toxic combo of \"we're all friends here even if you dislike someone, because my friend is also your friend\" and \"we've been doing it this way for X years so if you change that You Are Wrong even if provoked\".\n\nI really do think it would be worth reconsidering how you want these hangouts to work \u2013 maybe hit pause on some of the big group ones until everyone's got their heads on straight again and figure out what boundaries you want to draw. Just because your friends are friends with someone and you've hung out with them in the past, it doesn't mean you have to keep hosting them on a regular basis just because it's convenient for everyone else! We've all done it, I've done it too, just to keep the peace, but this regularly? Yikes, that's a lot. Maybe it's time to cut down the frequency, or focus on smaller hand-picked groups for a while.", "NtA but this sounds like high-school drama.", "NTA; you have the right to invite who you like to your home.

Let them. You can't stop them. You and they had a great time, but now you know at least some of the gang are not your personal friends, just friends of friends who enjoyed hanging around the pool. \n\nThe idea that you should treat your home as \"the Launchpad\" and act as if it wasn't your home, your name on the lease, your responsibility if the place burnt down, is nonsense. The idea that you are not entitled to basic human respect from your guests, or that you don't have the right to ask people to leave your home is nonsense too. \n\nI doubt Jordan is thinking of how he can outdo you as a host, he seems more focused on how he can take over control of the gang, and has confused your hospitality and generosity with control, which he is jealous of, and I suspect, can't match. So he is focusing on attacking you and getting the gang to take sides, while you continue to supply the hospitality. I am guessing that he *won't* be opening his home up as a gang hangout, and that you won't be the only one he wants out of the gang.\n\nI am guessing that your real worst enemies won't be Jordan or Amber, who won't darken your doorstep again. It will be the friends who protested about you asking Jordan to leaveb who only fully support him behind your back. The ones that want the convenience of treating your home as a place where they can hang out and do what they wouldn't want done in their own home, and see you as a kind of Jeeves that keeps things in order for them rather than someone who also will need to sometimes study, have some privacy, and be allowed to use their own home for their own selfish purposes even when the gang wants to party.\n\n So use the opportunity Jordan is giving you to take back your personal space and draw a few boundries. Life was going to split the gang up if Jordan didn't, anyway. You already know that not every gang member is a personal friend of yours, but be aware that some of them are going to come out as enemies now.\n\n Jordan has given you an opportunity to learn who your friends are. Your real friends may not include everyone you would wish, but you seem like someone who will have no difficulty finding quality new friends. And you will be keeping quality old friends as well (although, watch out for people who go to Jordan's side at first, then come to you with a focus on getting back at Jordan. Those are people that Jordan would rather were your friends, and they would rather be his. Really, not great friends for anyone.)\n\nHe does have one point - you do far more than your share of the hosting, and that does mean things are arranged on days and around themes that arr more to your convenience. You need to let some of the others take some the hospitality. You might not be aware of the opportunity cost of your hosting. The amount of time you spend getting the house ready for friends and cleaning up after is time they are putting into their more intimate relationships, their career, their families, their own selfish pleasures. You deserve a bit of what they get - going out with your friends and just enjoying the time as a guest, coming home to no mess or hassle.", "NTA AT ALL!

Quit the immaturity and be quieter for your neighbors.", "NTA obviously but this may be exactly what Jordan wanted and you should be careful about how you approach all of this going forward.  Focus on maintaining the relationships you want to maintain and try not to worry too much about who is right (the asshole) and who is wrong.", "I think you're NTA and I also think that *this was the exact outcome Jordan wanted*.\n\nThe fact that he was smirking at you when you removed him from your house (after burning food, setting off the fire alarm, and making your house stink of smoke!) tells me that splitting the group and turning people against you for \"being rude\" was *the entire plan* when he \"just decided\" he was going to pretend you don't exist.\n\nIf you don't exist, whose couch was he sitting on? Whose stove was he using? Whose food was he cooking?\n\nExplain to your friends whose only reason to keep him in the Launch Pad group (which is exclusively for planning get-togethers at your place) is that he's a long-standing member, that in deciding he is going to ignore your existence, he can't come over to your house. Ever. Because by the rules he LITERALLY just established, you don't exist, so this is just some random person's house, and him entering a stranger's house without permission would be trespassing. If he can't come to your house (because you don't exist, so this is NOT the house of a friend or anyone he knows), he can't be in the Launch Pad chat either, since it's for planning to meet at a house he can't go to, and he can't possibly have ever been invited to a chat group to meet at a house belonging to a person that he doesn't know (or won't acknowledge exists, which in this context is the same thing).\n\nFood? No. Stealing food from strangers is illegal.\n\nBeverages? Hell no, strangers who buy you drinks might drug you.\n\nSo if a gathering is going to include Jordan, it'll simply have to be someplace public- oh, wait, but bars, and restaurants, and movies, concerts, even some public pools want you to spend money to be there! What a shame. But since you'd never meet a stranger (who doesn't exist) in a *private place* where anything could happen, every get-together including Jordan and you will simply have to be somewhere very public from now on. Since you don't exist, and therefore he doesn't know you, so he'll have to provide his own food, drinks, seating, and entertainment if he wants to be included with the rest of your friends who acknowledge your existence.\n\nThen mention to your friends that it's very odd how he just decided he was going to ignore you the day of a get-together at your place and seemed weirdly gleeful when you kicked him out. You don't know what beef he has, and since he's now pretending you don't exist like a five-year-old, you have no opportunity to find out or even offer to make it right (not that you must or even want to necessarily), and that feels very suspicious, or even staged, and if it's a prank they should tell Jordan it's really not funny. Having to deal with the stink of burnt food in your house, be ignored by one of your friend group, and then find out from an entirely different friend that that person 'just decided' they're going to act like you don't exist, then being called a 'controlling bitch' when you followed the only logical action- that is, if you don't exist, you and he are strangers, and therefore this trespassing stranger should get out of your house- was, at best, a joke in extremely poor taste, and at worst, *incredibly toxic*.\n\nNot all your friends will think on it too deeply, but some will. Best of luck.", "Look carefully through the list of friends that have taken a position, remove/block/ignore all the people who think you're an AH and remain friends with all those who supported you for making a very commonsensical, reasonable, adult decision to kick this twelve-year-old child to the kerb.\n\nThe first group are most assuredly not your friends and are not deserving of your generosity, hospitality and kindness.
