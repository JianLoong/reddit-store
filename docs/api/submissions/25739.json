At some point, this baby is going to be born and will need a name, and you have an edge as the one birthing the child AND because you gave 169 options. He is welcome to say no to the whole list, but that also means you get to say no to his measly list of 4, and you both come up with more names. \n\nHim insisting on only those names means he has no interest in compromise, so he is telling you to take it or leave it, and you then played the car to leave it, and do what you want since that baby is coming out of you.", "NTA\n\nHe's refusing to consider any of your 169 names, why should you consider is 4 names.", "NTA.
