I told him I'm the mom so I am going to choose a name and I don't give a shit whether you like the name or not. He thinks I'm an asshole amd should learn to compromise but I gave him 169 fcking options I think that's enough compromise\n\nEdit: I'm going to answer some of the(stupidest) comments here. One accused me of not allowing him to have any input, wtf? I literally gave him the final choice, I gave him a long list of the names I like. Most people only have like 10 names but I gave him so many options\n\nThe other one saying we need a divorce. Are you a teenager?

The number of names changes how much of an AH they're being, so of course he's way worse, but the fact that they've both given a list of names that they say has to be chosen from gives them both the initial AH status.", "This isn't a zero-sum game - they're both AH. They need to be grownups and compromise. He needs to look at her list and she needs to stop with the ultimatums.", ">But he hasn't even looked at her list? If he looked and decided that he didn't like any of them they they could go from there, but he won't get off 2 names that he likes.\n\nOK? I think I was pretty clear that he is an asshole to \n\n>Someone who has 169 names on their shortlist doesn't seem like someone who's not open to new ideas.\n\nSomeone who says, \"here is my list, pick something off it\" As if that was at all a reasonable starting point *absolutely* sounds like someone who is not open to new ideas. Why would a person who is open to new ideas ever have that approach? Why would a person who is open to new ideas keep going on about the list instead of asking to talk about new ideas. Why would a person who is open to new ideas even have the thought \" I gave him 169 fcking options I think that's enough compromise\" cross their mind? Or continue to call the names on the list options she gave him rather than her preferences.\n\nYes he does seem like he's shutting the conversation down. And it sounds like her very initial approach was doing the same thing and her current approach is to decide she has the authority to shut it down completely and decide herself. \n\nThey both suck. She is not the poor reasonable person just at the end of her rope with an unreasonable partner. She also sucked right from the start.", "They both made a list and decided the name had to come off their list. Her list being longer does not make that an ok thing to do.\n\nHe didn't look at her list. She decided to make a sexist bullshit claim.\n\nShe is not at all better than him. They both suck.", "I misread that he had to pick from those names and that had he actually said no to all of them then if she wouldn't work with him to get more then yes e s h but I read it like this was her start. You need 2 people to name a baby. I think back on some of the names only one of us liked and I don't like them at all, even the ones I picked, heh.", "She can stop saying the ultimatum out loud but it is pretty much a given.\n\nShe's going to have a baby, theres a fairly definite deadline on this decision. If the babys born and they still can't compromise, then someone is just going to have to pick a name for the baby. I don't think she's an AH for voicing that fact, or not bowing to his will and naming the baby only what he wants."]}
