It was about $700 I think. However, I did NOT ask for this and honestly I freaking hate the color as it does not match anything in my place and it's also too big. I gave it to my friend who liked it and was moving to a different state. My boyfriend then got me a cute black standmixer that fit into my apartment a lot better so that's what I have.\n\nMy dad was over last night and he noticed that the grey standmixer was gone and replaced by the black one. He asked where it was and I told him the truth (namely, that I thought the grey was ugly so I gave it to my friend and my boyfriend got me the black one instead).\n\nMy dad was shocked and said the grey standmixer had cost a lot and that he thought I would have liked it so that's why he gave it to me as a present. Maybe here's where I'm the AH: I said if he would have been more observant, he would have known that I absolutely hate the color grey (it's my least favorite color) and everyone in my life who knows me knows that.\n\nI honestly wasn't trying to be rude, I was just stating a fact. But my mom called me today and told me I really hurt my dad and need to apologize for \"throwing away\" a thoughtful birthday gift my dad had put a lot of money and thought into.\n\nI don't think that's necessary, I think after my dad gave me the standmixer, it became mine and I could do anything with it. And I didn't \"throw it away\", I gave it to a friend.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1679760245, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/121qcs6/aita_for_giving_away_an_expensive_kitchenaid/", "score": 1137, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That mixer comes in like fifteen different colors.  I\u2019m sure your dad would have exchanged it for a color you like, including black, if you had used your words.  I bought my twenty year old two pieces of Le Creuset for her first apartment. One piece she loved the color and the style, the other she liked the color but not the style.  So you know what she did? She used her voice, told me she didn\u2019t know how much she would use that piece and we got something different.  Simple huh? No misunderstanding, no hurt feelings.  I\u2019d be embarrassed if you were my kid.  It\u2019s not the fact that \u201cit\u2019s a gift and my choice\u201d.  This isn\u2019t a Walmart gift card.  YOU chose not to communicate and hurt your dads feelings.  Bet he won\u2019t make any thoughtful gestures again.", "YTA He got you a very thoughtful and expensive gift and you just gave it away because it doesn\u2019t match your stuff. Okay. Could have maybe told him up front you wouldn\u2019t use it so he could get his money back. I can understand if you didn\u2019t want to hurt his feelings doing that so let\u2019s just skip past that part. Down the line when he asks about it you lash out at him and make him feel like he doesn\u2019t know you or care enough to learn what you actually like and basically ANYONE else would have known that you would HATE that gift. After he got you such a generous gift? Really??? What a spoiled brat.", "YTA\n\n>\tif he would have been more observant, he would have known that I absolutely hate the color grey (it\u2019s my least favorite color) and everyone in my life who knows me knows that.\n\nthis is one of those instances where it's time to come back down to earth. because at age 24, expecting people in your life to know your least favorite color is absolutely bizarre. and saying it's because he isn't observant is wildly mean.\n\ndid you even thank him for the *$700* gift?", "YTA. Your father gave you a gift that for the last decades has been the gold standard of kitchen appliances. This is an extremely thoughtful gift and meant to last you your lifetime. He probably thought this was the mixer you would take with you to your marriage and use when baking for your children. \n\nYou should have thanked him and explained that the color/size did not fit your taste, and to exchange it to something you would appreciate. \n\nYou sound really ungrateful to be honest.", "Jesus YTA.\n\nYou threw away\u2026. Sorry, regifted, somehow even worse\u2026.what sounds like the commercial grade, keep it for the rest of your life kitchen aid over the color?\n\nAfter you realize how stupid that was, then realize how petty that was. Then realize how insulting it was to your father.\n\n\nEDIT to add: I have the exact model I suspect your father gave you. It was a gift for our wedding from my in laws. 26 years ago. And nothing else has stood the test of time, nor been so utterly useful as we learned to cook and bake and make pasta and\u2026\u2026good lord you did a stupid, too young to know better thing.", "YTA  \n\n>the truth (namely, that I thought the grey was ugly  \n\nYou may not like the color, but you were ungrateful for the gift.   You should have told him as soon as you received the gift that the color wasn't one you would be able to live with, and you should have exchanged it for a color you liked, or for a model that was smaller, if that was also an issue.  \n\nYou handled the situation rudely.    \n\n>I honestly wasn't trying to be rude, I was just stating a fact.   \n\nJust because you were being factual, it doesn't mean you weren't being rude.    \n\n>I said if he would have been more observant, he would have known that I absolutely hate the color grey (it's my least favorite color) and everyone in my life who knows me knows that    \n\nThat hurt him.   \n\nThe world does not revolve around you.  Even though some people in your life may know you don't like the color, not everyone is hanging off every peep that comes out of your mouth and storing your comments for future reference.   \nSomehow your dad missed the detail that you don't like grey.  \n\nYour mom is right.   Apologize to your dad.", "YTA over color? Why didn't you just tell him you want to exchange it for a different color", "YTA \n\nBIG TIME!\n\nKitchenAid products are hella expensive but worth it. They literally last for 100 years or more! \n\nYou could have asked your dad to exchange it for a smaller one and a different color. \n\nYou are extremely cold, ungrateful and apathetic towards your own dad. I feel so bad for him.", "YTA x100.  If you didn't like it, you should have given it back so he could return it.  You just threw away 700 bucks of his because you didn't like the color.  You sound incredibly ungrateful and spoiled.  I'd be ashamed if you were my kid.", "How can I make it worse than giving away a genuinely heartfelt gift from my father? I know I\u2019ll insult him about it too. That should teach him a lesson.", "You couldn't ask for the receipt or told them you didn't like it and wanted to exchange it? I'd be done giving my kid gifts for a while if they just tossed a $700 gift. YTA", "YTA. Selfish selfish.", "YTA Your dad bought you a top of the line stand mixer that comes in a ton of colors (including black).  Instead of asking to exchange it for another color, you ended up with a crappy cheap black one that you\u2019ll need to replace in a year.  You basically got what you deserved in this situation because you were too good to communicate with your father who was extremely generous with his gift.", "YTA \n\nThose mixers are really expensive. But that's not even the point. He gave you a gift that he hoped you'd like and you just gave it away without a thought? If you didn't like the colour why didn't you ask him to exchange it?", "**YTA**\n\nCan I have your dad please? I want a parent who gives me KitchenAid.", "YTA. That was an expensive gift. Does not seem hard to to ask him to exchange it for a black one?\n\nThat is a classic that usually lasts 10+ years in kitchens. He was trying to contribute and you basically handed his $700 to someone he does not know.", "YTA. So he bought the wrong color so you decided to shame him? You sound like an entitled brat and I hope it\u2019s the last gift he ever buys you. You also know nothing about mixers as KitchenAid mixer is one of the best mixers on the market. Your dad splurged on you because he loved you and you gave it away without a thought.", "YTA.  That\u2019s about as bad as my sister that threw a fit because my dad bought her a nice used Honda Civic for her first car.  She had a meltdown because it wasn\u2019t a BMW.  My dad said fine if you don\u2019t like it we can sell it.  He sold it 2 days later.  When my sister asked when they were going to get her the BMW she wanted my dad said when you get a job and pay for it yourself, until then you\u2019re walking \ud83e\udd23. Hopefully your dad pulls something like my dad until you learn to have more gratitude.", "YTA.\n\nHe gave you a gift because he thought you'd like it, andcthen you turned it into an opportunity to shame him for not knowing minute details of your thoughts on colors and therefore questioning his place in your life. You transformed a gift into a shaming.", "YTA and a selfish brat. You could have exchanged it for a color you do like, or hell, watched a video on YouTube on how to paint it yourself. Your dad bought you an INCREDIBLY generous gift, but your bratty focus on \u201caesthetic\u201d meant that he *wasted* $700 (a not small amount of money) AND you made your boyfriend spend another $700 on you. I hope neither one of them buys you another present, like.. ever.", "YTA. All you had to do was say that it doesn\u2019t fit with your kitchen decor and apologise. He\u2019d have been able to get his money back.", "Yta\u2026instead of throwing it away why didn\u2019t you say \u201chey dad, thanks for the mixer.  Can we get it in a different color?\u201d  Instead you took this valuable gift that he thought you\u2019d appreciate and love and give it away. As if that not bad enough when asks you about you say well I hate grey and everyone in my life knows that.  You\u2019re a huge AH for not seeing how you hurt your father.  If I were your parent that would be the last gift you see from me.", "YTA big time \nAnd if you hated the colour don\u2019t keep it on display. It still works as a mixer", "Here's the thing. It's one thing to smile and say thank you then give away a 20$ sweater you hate. It's another to do it with a major kitchen appliance that cost 100s. If you had no problem being honest about the size and color, then why not mention it at the time and exchange it for something that worked better?\n\nYTA", "YTA for your poor attitude towards your dad. He doesn\u2019t live with you and your apartment aesthetic is probably not a big concern to him. Just because he doesn\u2019t know your favorite colors doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t care. You could\u2019ve asked for the receipt and gone to exchange it for a color you do like. Your mom is right that you should apologize to your dad.", "YTA my dad bought me this hideous pair of pajama pants.  Like so ugly.  He got them for me because they had my favorite football teams logo all over them.  He\u2019s passed on and those pants come out every Sunday during football season.  Enjoy what you can get from your dad before you lose everything.", "YTA \n\n\"Hey dad. Thanks so much for the gift. I love it but I'm not a fan of gray. Can we exchange it for a different color?\"\n\nSee how easy it would have been to use your words? You could have gotten a color you like without hurting dad's feelings.", "YTA. Not because you gave the mixer away, but because you weren\u2019t more tactful about it. \n\nSounds like your dad gave you a gift he genuinely thought you\u2019d like. You could have kindly said that you really appreciated it, but decided to swap for a colour that better suited your kitchen design.", "YTA. I'm a firm believer in regifting but considering the cost you absolutely should have exchanged it for a different colour. You saying that you didn't ask for it is somewhat moot considering you did in fact replace it with another more to your taste.", "YTA, spoiled and entitled while thinking nothing of hurting feelings of people who care enough about you to be thoughtful, this is some real thoughtless behavior.", "YTA\n\nThat's a very thoughtful gift and you're so undeserving. I hope he never buys you anything again.", "Wow. Your initial question should have been \"aita for speaking so poorly to my father regarding a gift that I didn't like because of the color and I'm trying to justify being a brat while dismissing his feelings?\"", "Ok, so, while it is true that you can do whatever you want with a gift after it is given, that doesn't mean that you are free from the consequences of that action.\n\nYou admit that this was not an insignificant gift. You do in fact want a stand mixer, since you have a different one now. This gift came from someone who was going to notice if it disappeared, and who you expect to have a relationship with moving forward.\n\nThe best approach to this would be to talk to your dad and let him know that you a) couldn't fit this large of a stand mixer in your apartment b) strongly disliked the color and c) *asked if you and he could return this one and get one better suited to your needs.* And thanked him for the thought. Then your dad's not out the money, your BF's not out the money for the second mixer, and no one's feelings are hurt.\n\nInstead you decided to pitch a fit, not communicate, and hurt your dad's feelings and damage your relationship with both your parents. Congratulations, YTA. Use your words next time.", "Someone could buy me a KitchenAid in the color of Diarrhea Shit Green, and I would still love it and use it until the wheels fall off.\n\nYTA", "YTA. How about instead of throwing a temper tantrum, you have a conversation with the man and see about exchanging it for a different color instead of giving it away, making your boyfriend buy you another one and whining about how an extremely thoughtful gift was the wrong color? You're a grown adult, act like it.", "YTA, my little baking heart is so sad!! If it's the one I think it is that's the the one that last for decades!!!\n\nYou could have just painted it!!! The 700$ stand mixer has the best motor that will make it through kneading bread, pasta making, sausage making without overheating.", "YTA. You could have simply told your dad. Okay, he got the colour wrong, but intent is what matters. Just be honest and say \"This is a really thoughtful gift, but for these reasons I don't think it's for me. How about we go shopping together and get one that matches?\".\n\nIt's not hard to tell family a gift isn't right, but just outright giving it away like it doesn't matter? That cuts deep.", "YTA you replaced an amazing piece of functional top performing equipment with junk that's gonna break because of the color? That alone would be YTA. But then you gave your dad, the gifter, a tongue lashing for your color preferences?\n\nYou should apologize for being an absolute brat to your father and pay him back the cost.\n\nEdit: spelling ugh", "YTA. You could have spoken to him about it and asked him to exchange it for a model and colour you wanted. That was a VERY generous gift and I\u2019m sure he was hurt by your behavior and actions.", "YTA. You could have told him you'd like to exchange it for a smaller black one but you just behaved like a spoiled kid.", "YTA \n\nIt\u2019s mind boggling that instead of telling your dad politely that you don\u2019t like the color of the mixer he gifted you and returning it to him (so that he could return it and get a refund), you gave it away to someone else.\n\nNo, it doesn\u2019t matter how close that friend is.\n\nYes, it was incredibly rude of you to give away a gift from a parent without giving them any heads-up.", "Why didn't you just exchange it instead? They come in various colors.", "YTA. Why not give it back to him so he could avoid wasting $700? Your decision-making process is wild.", "YTA - you could have just told your dad that your cherished friend was moving and you wanted her to have something that meant a lot to you. \n\nYour explanation must have felt like a bit of a gut punch.", "Holy shit YTA.", "YTA. You are entitled, spoilt and just horrible. Attitude stinks.", "YTA. \n\nI can\u2019t be bothered with the logistics of explaining why to you.", "YTA.\n\nAnd if I were your dad that mixer would likely be the last gift you ever received.\n\nYou were within your rights to give it away (though it was really a stupid thing to do, you could have exchanged it for another color and had a good-quality mixer with all the attachment potential that would last you for decades) but the tactless and cruel way you explained it was a complete AH move.", "Yta.", "YTA for not communicating like an adult.", "YTA, wow I hope this isn\u2019t real.", "\"Maybe here's where I'm the AH: I said if he would have been more observant, he would have known that I absolutely hate the color grey (it's my least favorite color) and everyone in my life who knows me knows that.\"\n\nTo be honest you were the AH before this, but this comment really puts the icing on the cake (baking pun intended).  You are so self absorbed that you really believe that everyone in your life knows your favorite and least favorite colors??  Get a grip.", "YTA you could've told your dad it wouldn't match and had him exchange for a different color or put it away and just take it out when you needed it. No need to hurt his feelings after he bought such a nice and expensive gift. You seem very ungrateful and dismissive of your father.", "YTA he probably bought you the Grey one because the professional grade mixers don\u2019t come in a lot of colours but will last you until your kids are dead. He chose function and durability so you would have something to last you a lifetime. If you didn\u2019t like it you should have asked him to exchange it. Lucky you to have parents who spend $700 on you and lucky you to be so financially secure you can throw away $700.", "YTA. What a rude and hurtful way to talk to your father. You definitely owe him an apology for being ungrateful and overly self-important. He should know your least favorite color? Get over yourself.", "I\u2019ve had my Kitchen Aid mixer since 2005; I use it all the time and it looks like I just got it.They last forever and handle anything you throw at them and I even have an attachment for freshly squeezed orange juice. YTA and I hope your friend appreciates what she\u2019s got", "I suspect OP sold it to the friend. \nYTA for all of the reasons.", "My god you're a brat! YTA!\n\nCouldn't have just had a damn conversation with your dad about it?\n\n\"Hey dad, I really love the present you got me, but it doesn't really match my kitchen, so could we maybe go together and exchange it for something more suited to my style?\"", "YTA.  Kitchen aid stand mixers are excellent as well as expensive.   Wonder how long that cute little stand mixer will last?   You could have *asked* your dad to exchange it for a color you like better, too.   I would not expect another nice present from him any time soon.", "He dOEsnT knOw My FAvoRite cOlor\u2026.

The nerve, the caudacity, you have.  \n\nIf it\u2019s not clear already YTA.", "Wow.\n\nYTA.", "YTA- wow... as a dad.. reading this hurt my heart. We don't always get shit right, but damn it sucks having it thrown in your face... or away.", ". . . Why didn't you just tell your dad initially you hated it? You obviously have nothing holding you back, so why not just be honest the first time instead of whatever the fuck you decided to do. Yta.", "YTA.\n\nI have to presume that you are from one extreme end or the other of the wealth spectrum, because only laughably rich people or laughably poor people would be silly enough to give away a $700 kitchenaid.", "YTA \ud83d\uded1\ud83d\uded1\ud83d\uded1\ud83d\uded1\ud83d\uded1 OP stop and listen to the advice people are giving you before you destroy one of the most important relationships in your life beyond repairing!\n\n1. This was a gift from your father, if you weren't crazy about the color you should have pulled up your big girl panties and simply said this is great however it might be a bit too big would you mind if we exchanged it for slightly smaller one? At that time you could have also looked for different color\n\n2. I believe if I remember correctly the larger more expensive machines only come in gray / silver so this is not about picking a color you like This was about picking you top of the line equipment for your kitchen... But nice job putting a spin on it to make it negative and make sure you're the victim\n\n3. So you took something your father gave you that was very expensive and you gave it to another friend but don't think there's anything wrong with this? Okay let's flip that around... Pretend you went out of your way and bought what you thought was a top-of-the-line expensive gift for somebody you love, now picture that person taking it and giving it away within days to somebody you don't know. How would that make you feel? Would that make you feel marginalized? Disrespected? Unappreciated? Unloved? Yeah that's exactly what you did to your father, and you're here asking for us to validate you the victim?\n\n4. Do you love your father at all? These are some pretty selfish actions and words coming from a young person, maybe take a few days to reflect on what you've said and done along with all the commas here from other redditors who are trying to help you.\n\n5. Think about the situation and try to genuinely see it from your father's perspective. If you love your father which I'm not entirely sure you do, make sure you tell him you absolutely love him or whatever he means to you and tell him you probably made a mistake now that you've thought about it and that you regret hurting him because that was not your intention.\n\nYou got a lot of life ahead of you and you can do better, try being nice to everybody around you it's free and easier than you think.", "YTA- a crappy daughter, spoiled, entitled, shallow, a bit indignant and basically sad. Way to hurt your dad. Good Job!", "I don\u2019t think I can fairly vote because I\u2019m too jealous. I\u2019ve wanted a KitchenAid mixer for ages. I\u2019m 40 and would have loved to get one (in any color) from my dad.", "Yay you could have returned it so he could have gotten some money back those are EXPENSIVE", "YTA. OP I'm rattled by this. This hurts me deeply in a number of ways. \n\nClearly your dad put a ton of thought into his gift and the way you treated him by \"being honest\" is horrible. \n\nI love being in the kitchen and the higher end model your dad bought is an incredible tool. If you didn't want it you should have offered it back to him and not pawned it off on a friend. (I'll bet he'd have run to return it for a cute one you liked). \n\nYou easily could have traded this to someone for the more shitty black model that's \"cute\" in your opinion and saved your bf $350 (and probably made $200 on top for yourself - your dad probably would have appreciated this more as well). \n\nYour dad seems awesome (I lost mine 4 yrs ago and hate that you treated yours so poorly, you have no clue what you have) and he deserves better.", "YTA. To actually come to Reddit to justify your actions makes me speechless and I feel really bad for your dad.", "YTA\n\nOP,  you never know when a gift is going to be The Last Gift. This hits me in a different way. I lost my dad back in October, a little over two months before Christmas. One of my last gifts from him is a red KitchenAid stand mixer. It doesn't go with my color theme for my kitchen, but I freaking love it. I cried like a baby when my mom gave it to me in his place because I knew it would be the last.\n\nCherish the gifts you receive from your loved ones, OP. You never know when it will be the last.", "YTA", "YTA if you didn\u2019t like the colour you could have been a grown up, told him and exchanged it for a different colour.", "YTA, egoistical and entitled.\n\nYou should jave talked to him, like an adult", "It won\u2019t be long before you grow up (hopefully) and you will only wish you could have that mixer back. They cost a lot of money for good reason. Good luck having enough spare money around to buy one on your own.", "YTA What a cold, cruel, and entitled way to handle the situation. Your father did something kind and you sound almost offended because it was the wrong color. Also if anyone, let alone everyone, knows what your least favorite color is, you sound unbearably obnoxious.", "YTA.  Of all the narcissistic, insensitive, thoughtless things to do when someone gives you an expensive gift, this tops the list.  What is wrong with you?", "Giving gifts to people who act like you did is the worst. You not only expressed that you hated it, you waited until he could not exchange it for a color you actually liked. You also blamed him for not knowing you would hate the color. It\u2019s not like he bought you a bright orange one. He purchased you a good-quality appliance that lasts like 30 years in a neutral color. You could have communicated that you wanted to exchange it for a smaller black one. It was a thoughtful gift and instead of appreciating it, you acted like he didn\u2019t even know you or something. YTA", "YTA. If you don't care that he knows then why didn't you just give it back to him so he could get the money back? You obviously come from some money or are just spoiled beyond belief that you can shrug off a $700 gift. It could have been $70 and I'd have the same judgement. It's not the fact you didn't like it, that's fine. It's your attitude and reaction that is AH behavior.\n\nNot only that but it's hilarious that you think *everyone* in your life knows that gray is your least favorite color. I honestly laughed. You're clueless if you think people care.", "Wow what an ungrateful asshole. I fucking hate people that say \"I didn't ask for..\"when someone does something nice for them. Your the type I'd leave along side the road when you needed help, after all you didn't ask", "Ungrateful ah. Yta", "YTA. Damn, I wish my parents could afford to get me a super nice mixer that lasts YEARS. You could\u2019ve easily gone and exchanged it for a different color. What a waste", "unless you really have some sort of OCD, YTA for giving away a completely functional gift from your father just because you don't like the color.", "This is one more reason society is going hell. Super selfish and entitled.", "I'm from the UK. Could you please tell me what a kitchen aid is please? \ud83d\ude01", "YTA, for the way you handled this. If it was too big you should have asked your dad if the two of you could return if for a smaller one(you'd have been able to get the color you wanted), and it would have been a nice outing for you both. Instead you were rude about the color and dismissive of his efforts in telling him it didn't fit your aesthetic. I don't think there is anything wrong with giving gifts to other people who will get more use out of them, but I do think you should at least wait a bit before you do it, and be more polite to the person who seemed to really try to get something you'd like.", "Wow...are  you really that obtuse?  Yes...in the legal sense, you own the mixer after it was gifted to you and could do with it as you choose.  That said...you could also have simply thanked your Dad for the thoughtful gift but asked him for the receipt so that you could exchange it for your preferred color.\n\nSo yes...you're a total AH.", "YTA and incredibly ungrateful, rude one at that.

It was about $700 I think. However, I did NOT ask for this and honestly I freaking hate the color as it does not match anything in my place and it's also too big. I gave it to my friend who liked it and was moving to a different state. My boyfriend then got me a cute black standmixer that fit into my apartment a lot better so that's what I have.\n\nMy dad was over last night and he noticed that the grey standmixer was gone and replaced by the black one. He asked where it was and I told him the truth (namely, that I thought the grey was ugly so I gave it to my friend and my boyfriend got me the black one instead).\n\nMy dad was shocked and said the grey standmixer had cost a lot and that he thought I would have liked it so that's why he gave it to me as a present. Maybe here's where I'm the AH: I said if he would have been more observant, he would have known that I absolutely hate the color grey (it's my least favorite color) and everyone in my life who knows me knows that.\n\nI honestly wasn't trying to be rude, I was just stating a fact. But my mom called me today and told me I really hurt my dad and need to apologize for \"throwing away\" a thoughtful birthday gift my dad had put a lot of money and thought into.\n\nI don't think that's necessary, I think after my dad gave me the standmixer, it became mine and I could do anything with it. And I didn't \"throw it away\", I gave it to a friend.\n\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
