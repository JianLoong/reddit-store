He found another woman he decided he wanted to be with instead of my mom and finally waited for my mom to kick him out due to cheating to leave the house. (So he could be righteous you know, to this day he says the reason he left was because my mother kicked him out.) He now lives with my 'evil' stepmom and pays no mind or attention to his current living children and has two new step children that he cares more about. He never comes to see my sisters anymore. He won't even send them a text to see how they're doing, he says \"You have to text me first.\" \n\nI have 5 siblings that I helped my mom raise because she couldn't do it all on her own especially after going through a deep depression after he left. My moms foreign so I help her with paperwork and translations, Im also her PCA because she is disabled and can't work. My mom doesn't do her taxes because she has no income besides SSI. \n\nMy fathers been filing taxes and claiming my sisters as dependents continually after the divorce. He would give some of the dependant money to my mom in the beginning but that was when he used to actually see the kids and show them more attention. Now he won't see them at all and doesn't care. A couple weeks ago , I texted my father asking him if he's planning to give my mother at least half the money if he's going to file my sisters on his taxes this year. (2022 Child Tax Claim - $2,000 per child) and my father had 3 children he could claim this year. His response to me was, \"No way, this is MY money.\" \n\nSince my dad has been claiming them on his taxes, he got every single stimulus check that a child has received and would lie to my mother the amount they would get back. The final ones, he didn't give to my mother at all and decided to go on a vacation to Mexico with my stepmom instead. \n\nMy father doesn't even have the paperwork to get my mothers permission to claim them, they DON'T  live with him and he sees them a total of MAYBE 7 times a year. All 5 of my siblings live with my mother. \n\nI talked to my friend about this situation and she gave me advice to report him to the IRS for fraud, she gave me the appropriate paperwork to fill out and to send. I did it, my mother was upset but was happy I filled it out. It could result in penalty or even jail time for him.\n\nNow that I've done it, I feel enormous guilt. My siblings and family members from my fathers side are very upset at me because I told my father I would do it and he told me he didn't believe me. I love him still a lot and I've always wanted a relationship with him and now we definitely have no chance of having a daughter-father relationship, and I have his only 2 grandchildren. \n\nDid I do the wrong thing by reporting my own father to the IRS?", "created_utc": 1677847525, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11gzv5g/aita_for_reporting_my_father_to_the_irs/", "score": 174, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because of this deeply rooted guilt, I kept my dad in my life for 39 years, hoping he would see the light and change. He didn\u2019t. And after a particularly hurtful situation in which he accused me of being a bad mom (oh the irony!), I finally cut him off completely. That was almost a year ago and I\u2019m more happy now than I have been in a very long time. \n\nThe thing with narcissists is that they use your weakness to manipulate you. If ever get feel wronged, they place the blame on anyone but themselves. It\u2019s a constant cycle of notional games, causing the abused person to constantly second guess themselves. Don\u2019t fall for it.\n\nThe sooner you cut ties with him, the better. I know - easier said than done but it HAS to happen if you want to live a happy life. Read up on narcissistic behavior and go to a therapist. \n\nBy feeling guilty, you are giving your dad the upper hand of control. Don\u2019t feel guilty. YOU didn\u2019t do this.

His actions have consequences and you shouldn't feel bad because of his extremely poor behavior. You're doing the right thing.\n\n\nI would firmly consider never having your children around him.

To EVERYONE who will listen.\n\nYes, they'll judge, but if you hold your head up high, stand by your decision and not waver, most of the times you'll withstand the storm and HE will be the one judged harshly.\n\nLay it all out, tell em to judge for themselves. If you have screen shots of his refusals and daring you to turn him in, show them to any and all. Especially how he used the money to vacation instead of helping his kids in the middle of a pandemic.\n\nThey WILL push you to see if you back down, but if you stand strong, they'll turn on him.\n\nNow there's some who will NEVER believe you, but most will side with you if you give it enough time. \n\nCan you tell I've been through this myself? I've learned a lot in 10 years of repeatedly outing my parents criminal activities. The last time was the final time, and I used the above method to handle business. I've not been bothered once since my last outing, and my parents have suddenly found a life of legal activities for once in their miserable lives. \ud83d\ude02\n\nBtw, so NTA.", "There'll maybe be one or 2 YTA or ESH's that will then get downvoted to the very bottom, everyone else will say NTA", "Honey, it sounds like you've got a narcissistic father. I would suggest heading over to r/JustNoFamily for a little deprogramming.", "Good guys don\u2019t steal from the disabled women they cheated on. \n\nThe fact that these people remain his friends does make them unreliable narrators.", "What\u2019s being split if your mom isn\u2019t filing taxes? If the agreement was that he would claim them and then give her half the money that\u2019s not an IRS problem, she\u2019d have to sue him for non payment. The IRS only cares if more than 1 person tries to claim kids. \n\nI\u2019m certainty not an expert here but I know my dad had to file taxes when he was on disability as they still make you pay taxes on it. Hopefully you didn\u2019t open a Pandora\u2019s Box here and she should be filing. Again, I have no idea what the rules are here so it might be good to to seek a professional opinion. \n\nObviously NTA here. Screw him. Just make sure you all are doing the right thing on your moms side. Don\u2019t screw around with the IRS as they always find out. I made an honest mistake on my taxes a decade or so ago and they came back wanting their money.", "Well, then I think you did the right thing. He was practically stealing from your mother.", "This sounds very good! I hope it happens.\nThanks for the info.", "OP hasn\u2019t really said that tho, hence the question. If dad has been providing child support this whole time (and Mom didn\u2019t say anything) then this a different story. If no child support, then obvious answer on other side.", "I wouldn\u2019t assume the OP is aware of that particular tax rule. Most people who aren\u2019t divorced parents or tax professionals don\u2019t.", "[deleted]", "Yep it was hilarious because we were married with 2 kids and his mom was getting child support. The debt doesn't vanish just because the kids became adults. If the mother files a back child support claim then the state and IRS will go after him. Especially since some states take a cut of the child support and usually the non-custodial parent will try to avoid paying child support by working cash jobs and either improperly filing taxes or not filing at all so the IRS will be highly interested.", "Sorry, guess I misread the OP. From that, it sounded like the father had just been sending part of previous years returns. That would not count as child support, nor would it count as providing for the dependents.", "Sadly no, but that's yet another failing of the US education system. Taxes are needlessly complicated here, and the education system doesn't help at all in warning people how they work.", "I think I understand why you think so. I don't agree however.", "True, and I may be over interpreting the lack of explicit \u201cthis is all he gives\u201d. If you\u2019re interpretation is right I\u2019d definitely agree with you.", "That\u2019s exactly how I read it too.", "I mean I work in taxes and have since 2014. I barely know anything about employment taxes or state level taxes because I don\u2019t work with them. However, if your tax return is \u201ccomplicated\u201d it usually means you\u2019re making enough money that you are paying a preparer. Self-Preparing things like Schedule E, Form 8582, etc can be an expensive mistake. \n\nA tax return with W-2s and dependents is not complicated. If you have a high school degree you can easily prepare yours accurately. \n\nPeople are just so afraid they quit before even stating.", "My interpretation comes from a fighty family and that stupid tax class that is forever burned in my brain and made me decide to never become a tax accountant. Though the IRS does change the rules every few years"]}
