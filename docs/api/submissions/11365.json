He found another woman he decided he wanted to be with instead of my mom and finally waited for my mom to kick him out due to cheating to leave the house. (So he could be righteous you know, to this day he says the reason he left was because my mother kicked him out.) He now lives with my 'evil' stepmom and pays no mind or attention to his current living children and has two new step children that he cares more about. He never comes to see my sisters anymore. He won't even send them a text to see how they're doing, he says \"You have to text me first.\" \n\nI have 5 siblings that I helped my mom raise because she couldn't do it all on her own especially after going through a deep depression after he left. My moms foreign so I help her with paperwork and translations, Im also her PCA because she is disabled and can't work. My mom doesn't do her taxes because she has no income besides SSI. \n\nMy fathers been filing taxes and claiming my sisters as dependents continually after the divorce. He would give some of the dependant money to my mom in the beginning but that was when he used to actually see the kids and show them more attention. Now he won't see them at all and doesn't care. A couple weeks ago , I texted my father asking him if he's planning to give my mother at least half the money if he's going to file my sisters on his taxes this year. (2022 Child Tax Claim - $2,000 per child) and my father had 3 children he could claim this year. His response to me was, \"No way, this is MY money.\" \n\nSince my dad has been claiming them on his taxes, he got every single stimulus check that a child has received and would lie to my mother the amount they would get back. The final ones, he didn't give to my mother at all and decided to go on a vacation to Mexico with my stepmom instead. \n\nMy father doesn't even have the paperwork to get my mothers permission to claim them, they DON'T  live with him and he sees them a total of MAYBE 7 times a year. All 5 of my siblings live with my mother. \n\nI talked to my friend about this situation and she gave me advice to report him to the IRS for fraud, she gave me the appropriate paperwork to fill out and to send. I did it, my mother was upset but was happy I filled it out. It could result in penalty or even jail time for him.\n\nNow that I've done it, I feel enormous guilt. My siblings and family members from my fathers side are very upset at me because I told my father I would do it and he told me he didn't believe me. I love him still a lot and I've always wanted a relationship with him and now we definitely have no chance of having a daughter-father relationship, and I have his only 2 grandchildren. \n\nDid I do the wrong thing by reporting my own father to the IRS?", "created_utc": 1677847525, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11gzv5g/aita_for_reporting_my_father_to_the_irs/", "score": 721, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because of this deeply rooted guilt, I kept my dad in my life for 39 years, hoping he would see the light and change. He didn\u2019t. And after a particularly hurtful situation in which he accused me of being a bad mom (oh the irony!), I finally cut him off completely. That was almost a year ago and I\u2019m more happy now than I have been in a very long time. \n\nThe thing with narcissists is that they use your weakness to manipulate you. If ever get feel wronged, they place the blame on anyone but themselves. It\u2019s a constant cycle of notional games, causing the abused person to constantly second guess themselves. Don\u2019t fall for it.\n\nThe sooner you cut ties with him, the better. I know - easier said than done but it HAS to happen if you want to live a happy life. Read up on narcissistic behavior and go to a therapist. \n\nBy feeling guilty, you are giving your dad the upper hand of control. Don\u2019t feel guilty. YOU didn\u2019t do this.

His actions have consequences and you shouldn't feel bad because of his extremely poor behavior. You're doing the right thing.\n\n\nI would firmly consider never having your children around him.

I will give you a few words: \"I have chosen not to involve you, because this is a family issue, but now that dad has pulled you in I will give you the full story. You may not know that the reason mom kicked dad out was because he had been cheating on her for years with multiple women. Most recently with his current wife. For the first couple of years, he did help out occasionally, and did make a little effort to see his children. However, over the last several years he has done nothing. What he has done is \\*insert shit he has done\\* and he has defrauded the United States Government along with essentially stealing from my siblings. I don't think you understand how much mom struggles just to feed her children while dad takes vacations to Mexico on money that should have gone to feed and cloth his children.\n\nThe man you are defending is a criminal who has abandoned his children. And you judge me for my lack of loyalty. I have taken care of my family, and will defend them from anyone who would hurt them, even their own father. Even you. Now that I have said my piece in this, there is nothing for us to discuss further. If you continue to support my dad's sinful, immoral, and illegal behavior, then there is no reason for us to have any contact, because that alone tells me who you are.\"", "He had it coming! He only had himself to blaaaame!", "Agreed.  Go speak to your minister/priest/deacons, whatever clergy you have.  Tell them how you had to do the right thing because he wasn't.  Start there, most people will follow their lead.  But, yes, also talk to EVERYONE about it.  Some people will always say you're wrong but the ones who matter will see the truth.", "So much this. Lay it out to the church pastor/head about how guilty you feel, but that you're just trying to do right by your mom, how hard she's struggled, and how he contributes NOTHING to your household but takes the tax credits and stimulus. Confide in trusted elders in the church community about how terrible you feel, but how awful it is to see your little family struggle now that he's abandoned them. \n\nIt might also be worth talking to the church to see if they have resources. If your siblings are dependents, your mom likely qualifies for tax credits, etc.", "I understand that the only winner here might be the IRS but I was thinking maybe it was time for him to deal with his consequences.", "NTA, if indeed it is HIS money, he won't get in trouble.", "Yep, OP should find a new church if they're this horrible to her.  But first, NC with their father.", "It can also be a part of the divorce decree. Do you know if he got permission to claim the kids as dependent on the divorce decree? If so, it isn\u2019t fraud.", ">... your child must have lived with you for more than half the year. **There are exceptions for** temporary absences, children who were born or died during the year, adopted or foster children, kidnapped children, and **children of divorced or separated parents.**\n\nhttps://www.irs.gov/publications/p501#en_US_2022_publink1000220898", "Not 100% sure on the EITC specifically, because the laws have changed since I worked filing taxes *many* years ago.\n\nBut, boiled down *really* basically. You get deductions and you get credits. For example some *states* offer a \"renter's tax credit\" where a portion of money paid for rent is counted against taxes owed. And if you don't *owe* any money, it leads to getting money back. Same with other tax credits.\n\nEITC is another \"credit\". It's for the general purpose of offsetting child care expenses so that parents can still be part of the workforce. It's by far the *biggest* tax credit, but it's not the *only* credit.\n\nLikely, your mother would get nowhere near the same amount as your father would, claiming the same dependent, because even between 2 working people, the amount of the credit depends on how much you *earned*. \n\nBut again, there are *other* credits. I can't know what your mother could claim, because I don't know her, but you can definitely talk to someone who can help. Some tax preparation firms only charge if you file and get a refund, and will happily do a consult for your mom to see if there's money to be gained. \n\nIf so, you could help her file every year.\n\nBut I always say that people should file every year even if they don't owe anything and won't get a refund. Because you never know. Things like the stimulus checks during the pandemic? Those would have gone to your siblings (might still do, depending what happens with your father). \n\nDefinitely take a look at what's available for her!", "If someone\u2019s sole income is social security benefits, they\u2019re not required to file taxes. \n\n[Source](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-news/at-01-08.pdf)\n\nWhen it comes down to who has the right to claim the children on their tax return, based on federal law it\u2019s the custodial parent. \n\nThe custodial parent is determined by who the child/children lived with a majority of the year. Even if the dad was providing financially, which he is not, the mom would still be the custodial parent as the children live with her full-time.\n\nThis is definitely an overall shitty situation due to the dad\u2019s greed and selfishness but I don\u2019t see it backfiring on the mom.\n\nUnless she filled a Form 8332, which is a release by the custodial parent to claim children as dependents, the IRS will care enough to get involved.", "Hello fellow survivor! You know how this works too. \n\nThose receipts are everything too. In my last round I get so fed up of people siding with my parents that I blasted them publicly on SM. It's highly effective if you encounter a lot of push back. \n\nI've actually used it twice to EXTREME EFFECTIVENESS. \n\nPeople like to see proof of action and decide from there. That's why screenshots are so persuasive. \n\nMy in-laws were crying the boohoo hoos to everyone they met because they believed my criminal parents over me. Their texts cussing me out, along with my and my husband's responses went up onto SM to put an end to the rest of the family verbally attacking us. \n\nNot a single word has been said to us since. In fact the rest of his family has begun treating us a whole lot better since then. \n\nSometimes it doesn't pay to be the better person.... Sometimes you have to get your hands dirty to be able to wash your life of toxic people.", "\u201cHowever, the child will be treated as the qualifying child of the noncustodial parent if all four of the following statements are true.\u201d\nAnd then continue to read Lines 3, and 4a and 4b :)", "Yeah my dad also had his pension. I just remember him complaining every year that he had to pay taxes on his disability. \n\nVery true on the custody/claiming. My divorce decree said me and the ex would alternate years on who got to claim the kid and we each had to fill that out every year.", ">And then continue to read Lines 3, and 4a and 4b\n\nLine 3: \"The child is in the custody of one or both parents for more than half of the year.\" This is met, so I'm not sure why you mentioned it.\n\nLine 4a: \"The custodial parent signs a written declaration...\" The person you replied to specifically mentioned a situation where a decree *does* exist, and you responded with a misleading statement that failed to account for such decrees.\n\nLine 4b: \"A pre-1985 decree of divorce...\" Presumably this is not applicable."]}
