I loved my aunt Tracy and I was even nicknamed after her nickname.\n\nAfter my sister's birth my mom wanted to move us down south. While she was house hunting, we stayed with Tracy's mom. After my sister stole some jewelry, Tracy and my mom disagreed and to this day still don't talk.\n\nOnce I went to college near my hometown, I reconnected with Tracy after 8 years. Safe to say it was incredibly emotional, and I had missed her dearly. Even now she's my closest aunt and we just have an understanding and love for each other I never had with my mom.\n\nWhen my mom found out I reconnected with Tracy, she wasn't happy. She was even less happy when I stayed with Tracy after my school shut down due to covid. My mom also never missed a chance to throw my relationship with Tracy in my face when we argued, saying things like \"go talk shit about me to Tracy since I'm so terrible\" or, after Tracy posted a picture of me with my license captioned \"daughter from another mother\", she started using those exact words, never mind that my best friend's mom posts pics of me with that same caption and has for the last 12 years.\n\nFast forward and I recently have been going through financial hardships and was cutting things out that were too expensive, like the $80 phone bill I pay with my mom even though my phone is fully paid for. I let her know I was switching to a new plan (didn't say with who) and asked for her cooperation (this was a month or two after a spat prior to my graduation, which she didn't attend). She acted like she was in my corner but when I asked for my transfer pin, she left me on read. I messaged her the same thing three days in a row, watched as she read it until the last day when she snapped and said not to rush her and that she was busy and she would get back to me on her own time. I told her I had politely asked for it (granted it took three click to get and I should already have access since I'm 22 and pay my bill) and she ignored me with no response. After an argument, I gave up on keeping my number, got a new number through Tracy's line and decided to take a break from her and give her my number later.\n\nNot even a week later I get an email from my mom saying something along the lines of this: \"You could have told me you switched plans. I see where I stand. You can tell people I'm dead. You have your mother from another mother anyways.\" We went back and forth after this, with me texting her from my new number and her blowing up my email. Eventually, at my aunts' advice, I just ignored her emails. I haven't talked to her since.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696374680, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16z6r48/aita_for_reconnecting_with_my_aunt_and_changing/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If this is how she treats you, might be better off with people who treat you well and not this passive aggressive stuff.", "NTA. Your mom is being manipulative. Live your life, she\u2019s making her own choices as an adult woman.", "NTA, your mother is expecting you to continue a fight she's busy having that has nothing to do with you. That makes your mom TA. Manipulation isn't ok at any age, and your mom is an adult. If she wants to disown you over this, she's certainly entitled to do so, but you aren't required to care. Enjoy your time with your aunt.", "NTA. Your mom sounds toxic, narcissistic and a drama queen. Sounds very familiar in fact. I know I'm pointing out the obvious, but what did she expect when she didn't give you the pin.\n\nShe sounds like someone who is only happy when she has something to complain about so in a weird way, you have given her what she wants: victimhood and martyrdom.", "NTA\n\nYour mother, on the other hand has so many issues, she's a full subscription.  It must be really horrible being her and existing between her ears.  I'm glad you have Tracy in your corner!", "NTA.\n\nYour mom has issues that she needs to sort out.  Hopefully she does, if not, it sounds like you don't really need her in your life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
