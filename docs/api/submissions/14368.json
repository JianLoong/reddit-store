Eventually he'll learn that he can either eat what you provide or deal with the situation.", "I know you mean well, but I don't see how him not eating at all is better than eating food you disagree with. This isn't on the same level as eating moldy food, but it's also not how you help children form healthy relationships with how they consume it. NAH, but you could go about it in a better way that's not just \"do what I say or you can't have dinner.\" (\"Allowing\" an 11-year-old to prepare himself dinner when he obviously doesn't know how to do it to your standard isn't an appropriate alternative.)", "NTA. You aren\u2019t starving him, he can make himself something else. Good job! It\u2019s hard to break the junk food habit with kids.", "[deleted]", "NTA.  It is the role of the parent to feed the child nutritious food, which you are doing.  The only advice I will give you is that you don't fight about it.  Don't drive a wedge between the two of you.  If he doesn't want to eat it just let it go.  Don't give in, but don't fight over it.", "Kid is not starving by any stretch.  \n\nAlso, kid has an option of eating something else. \n\nNTA", "NTA  - This is on the other side of the planet from \"letting him starve.\"  You've provided him food, and you've also got food that he can make if he doesn't want what's provided.  Your ex needs to get a grip and it wouldn't hurt her to learn that she's making your son's life, and the lives of everyone around him, harder with the tantrum enabling.", "NAH (yet).  BUT I\u2019d try to make at least one dish in the meals that you know he will eat .  Most kids will eat some kind of rice, potato (not fries) or pasta or have at least some veggie they like.\n\nAnd stop the \u201cone bite\u201d rule. Stop fighting him at all and act like you don\u2019t give AF whether he tried it or not.   Take the stress out of meal times and make them enjoyable.  \n\nHe\u2019s old enough to help in the kitchen as is the 9yo (with limits), get them involved in choices and preparations.   Make Food Fun Again should be your motto.", "NTA\n\nIf he were 6, sure it might be different. But at 11, he's plenty old enough to make himself a sandwich or a bowl of cereal or a vegetable plate if he doesn't like what you've made, especially since you've had him tested for autism and got a \"no\" response. Again, it would be different if you just insisted he wasn't because you don't want him to be, but you've done the legwork here.\n\nWhat you might do, which might make things easier, if see of there are healthier versions of his garbage food you can make together. Like, maybe no frozen pizza, but something with fresh ingredients on a flatbread. No Tyson blended chicken nuggs, but chop up some breasts and do a light fry. Or try grilled.", "NTA. You are trying to introduce healthy eating habits. However going slow maybe a better approach. You know that your ex feeding him garbage, so it is worth to spend some extra effort finding what else he will eat instead of forcing your food on him.", "NTA. He's 11, not 4. He'll be a teenager soon. And it's not like you're telling him \"eat everything or don't eat\", you're saying \"eat a few bites or cook something for yourself\" giving HIM the option to fix the situation if he's unhappy. If he refuses, then that's on him.\n\nThe best parenting advice I ever heard was \"you aren't raising children, you're raising functional adults\". I think you are giving him a lot of autonomy in this situation and it doesn't hurt to put the idea in his head now that he can't eat junk for every meal. Keep doing what you're doing. I think he'll be a better adult for it in the long run.", "Soft YTA.  I agree with the generally principle of having kids try a variety of foods to develop and expand their palates.  Plus, as he gets older, your son will end up in social situations where he will be expected to eat something that may not be entirely to his taste, and it\u2019s good to learn how to do so without making a scene over your dislike of it. \n\nThat said, because of the custody situation I think should adapt your parenting methods on this to the reality of your son\u2019s situation.  I agree with having him try a bite of everything and then being allowed to make something else if he dislikes it, but I think you should have food in for him to make that you know he does like/eat.  \n\nRight now you are turning food into a power play with your son, which you will lose since you can\u2019t actually force him to eat.  Take that dynamic out of it and you\u2019re more likely to have long-term success with getting your son to eat a healthier and more diverse diet.", "You can have sensory issues without being Autistic.", "NTA. By any chance are your sons \u201csafe foods\u201d really his mother\u2019s safe foods? She definitely sounds like she\u2019s projecting her autism and preferences onto him despite him not being autistic. I think you\u2019re safe to stay the course. He\u2019s eating two solid meals plus snacks, he has the option to make himself something which at 11 he is capable of doing, and he isn\u2019t being forced to do anything other than try the food. My parents would call it the \u201c1 polite bite\u201d if you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t eat it but you tried it.", "NTA. But I'd speak to a dietician for advice as ideally there should be a middle step to get them to eat healthier, even if just a little bit.", "NTA\n\nI was once a picky eater when I was young. I would cry when I don't like the food (most of the time, vegetables). My parents didn't force me to eat---either I eat the food being served or don't eat at all and be hungry. Then when I was a teen (still a picky eater), I was able to earn some money from summer jobs, so whenever I don't like the food being served, I'd buy bananas, and that's what I'll eat, together with rice.\n\nWhen I started college, I began tasting vegetables little by little, liked them and eat them. When I graduated from college, I realized my palate has completely change because I now eat almost all kinds of food, be it vegetables, meat, seafoods, fruits, etc.. My mom was even surprised when she visited me, because she saw me eating the kind of foods that I used to hate.\n\nYou are doing fine with your kid. I believe someday, his palate will change and will eventually like foods that he used to hate. But it's good that you are teaching him to eat balanced and well seasoned foods. He's old enough to prepare his own food if he doesn't like what's being served.", "[deleted]", "Have you discussed the situation with your custody lawyer, because what she is doing is truly detrimental to your son's health, and it needs to be stopped.

However, I do disagree with him being required to take a bite of everything.", "NTA Why would someone with autism WANT their child to be autistic? Maybe get some hate here, but why, after 3 series of tests, is she insisting he is autistic? You want your kids to eat a well balanced meal. See nothing wrong with this. The types of food he wants are fine for a young kid, occasionally, but a constant diet of snack foods? Unhealthy.", "NTA, your ex is enabling bad habits", "Forcing children to take a bite puts you in AH territory. If he doesn\u2019t want it, just leave it at that. He\u2019ll eat when he\u2019s hungry. A lot of kid\u2019s experience sensory issues with new foods. He\u2019ll get there in his own", "NTA. I'm more concerned about the mother's behavior and I'd even go so far and talk to a lawyer about it, because it's not healthy that she keeps telling him that he's autistic. Neither are her food choices.", "I think that fact that you aren\u2019t forcing him to eat the whole plate, instead saying he has to try it but if he doesn\u2019t like it he can have something else, is the key here. You are giving him options. He\u2019s just mad because he\u2019s not getting exactly what he wants. NTA", "NAH. Picky eater here (52f). I was told by my parents that I had to at least have one or two bites of something I didn't like, or I could make myself a PB&J. It's hard for some kids to try new foods, but I do think you're going about it mostly correctly. The problem I see is constantly making it a struggle between you and your son. This can lead to him having an unhealthy relationship with food, and you don't want that.\n\nNext time he has a doctor's appointment, take time off work and meet ex there. Go into the room with them and air your concerns with the doctor. If you aren't able to get into the appointment with them, then send an email to the doctor with your concerns. Try to find out workable solutions for everyone.\n\nAlso, talk to a lawyer about custody arrangements. What ex is doing doesn't rise to the level of abuse, but there is some harm being done with her constantly letting him eat junk food and convincing him he's on the spectrum and that he somehow \"deserves\" to eat however he wants because of it.\n\nIt may be that because she's on the spectrum (you didn't specify what functioning level), she's unable to continue having primary custody of him. Just because someone with ASD is high functioning, doesn't mean they're able to make the proper decisions needed when raising a child.", "ESH. \n\nThis is honestly a difficult situation. The biggest problem is between you and your ex. You're supposed to be co-parenting and your child is suffering because of it. Having two completely different sets of rules at different parents houses is extremely hard for a child. If you had your child full time I would completely agree with your approach. I did something similar for my child as he grew up and he's a great eater. However, my nieces and nephews are extremely picky and impossible to cook for. I have to accommodate them when they come over and make sure I have something I know they will eat. Granted the situation is completely different because this is your child. The problem I see is that everything you've worked hard to achieve is lost by the time he goes back with his mom. And honestly this is a symptom of a larger problem because his mother is reinforcing that this is not something he is choosing but something that is part of him due to autism. You're going completely against that and telling him it's his choice what to eat. \n\nI think a softer approach is needed. He's old enough to make his own choices to a certain extent. I would recommend making some food he is used to available and rewarding him for choosing food that's outside of his normal food. Get him to want to try new food rather than putting him in the difficult situation of being forced to eat food that his mother has reinforced that he shouldn't be forced to eat. \n\nUltimately, something needs to be done about your ex. Telling your child that they are something there not is a dangerous road and that should be looked at as the major issue. What food your child eats is nothing compared to being told they're autistic when they're not.", "Yta. You can't control it like this and just because it worked for one child doesn't mean it'll work for another. If he only eats certain foods and you're not providing those foods just because u think this kid should be able to tough out whatever food issues he has, then yeah you're starving your kid.  \n\nEdit he doesn't have autism but that didn't mean he's fully neurotypical or doesnf have textural issues", "NTA.  He is eating two meals plus snacks, but testing boundaries at dinner.  He isn't actively dying or starving!  Perhaps it's time to get some intervention going and get mom to speak to a nutritionist to inform her the damage she is doing to your child.  Good luck!", "Info: Is your son actually diagnosed as autistic? If you're ignoring/dismissing your son's condition that would make you TA.", "NTA. Your intentions aren't bad but your actions could be a lot more efficient. Incentivize him to eat his food in some way, like for example if he really likes a TV show tell him the main character loves this food, which can be a spark to get him to eat it, or anything that would *want* to do it. Once you figure out what it is, you have won half the battle. Right now this might not be a problem, but later on he might develop eating disorders or eating habits/insecurities which wouldn't benefit him.", "NTA.  Letting him maintain shitty eating habits will do significant damage to him long term.", "NTA. Its good youre trying to teach him how to eat healthy. He needs that. You arent starving him. Theres food just not what hr usually eats at mom's.", "NTA\n\nIf he's \"starving\" it's by his own choice. There's food available and already made. I do something similar with my four year old and two year old. They can eat what I make or nothing. Go figure when they get hungry they eventually eta what I've made with a \"wow it is yummy\". Kids are stubborn but there's no need for anyone to only eat nuggets and pizza", "I'm sort of sitting the fence on this, not sure whether to lean toward a soft NTA or a soft YTA. Every kid is different and just because he's not autistic doesn't necessarily mean there aren't other sensitivities or behavioral issues here. I 100% believe you should be trying to get your son to explore new foods, but I wonder about the toughness of the approach you're describing. My uncertainty about how to vote here comes from my own personal experience with my autistic kid brother. Our mom was like your ex-wife and never challenged his \"safe foods\", so when she died and I got him, he was only eating pizza, chicken nuggets, grilled cheese or peanut butter sandwiches. I started a soft push to encourage him to try new things. I allowed him to choose what he was trying and reinforced the rule \"if you don't like it, you don't have to finish it\". It was a slow transition, but now his diet is far more varied and he's not afraid of trying new things. I tried to take a positive approach, almost a happy exploration into the unknown (if that makes sense). I think you're negative approach is going to make trying new things a bad experience.", "Nta.  \n\nHe is not starving, and he will not starve.   \n\nHe will cave and eat your food long before he ever starves.", "I don't think you're an asshole but why make the dinner table a warzone? I prepared one meal for dinner and when my children were younger I told them if they didn't like it, eat a bowl of cereal. My children laugh about it now and all the foods they wouldn't eat then and love now.", "Info, why haven't you gotten him assessed? I know you don't believe he's autistic and you might be right however you and yours ex aren't qualified to make the call.", "Our rule was always three bites of everything on your plate and then you can eat a peanut butter sandwich. I think you're being more than fair, especially if you always have one side dish that is plain like corn or peas or mashed potatoes. NTA but maybe give him the option of choosing one meal per week that he helps prepare. If he's willing to learn to make homemade chicken strips or fresh pizza I think he deserves to get to eat it.", "NTA\n\nBut any chance you can motivate him to get an interest in food? Pizza and chicken nuggets arn't soooo bad if you make it at home from scratch and maybe you can encourage your son to prepare the pizza with you and try to encourage him to experiment with the food. You can also start with baking / making pudding etc if he likes this more. You can also start by making food for a \"food fight\" and then just throw it at each others etc. Just everything that allowes him to come in touch with food w/o pressure.  \n\nThe problem here is not only the eating, the eating is a symptom. He doesn't have access to a variety of food in his main home to explore his taste w/o his mom sitting in his ears and whispering \"pizza, nuggets, mc donalds\".  Your son is experiencing a lot of pressure around food. At yours its you guys who control he doesn't eat unhealthy and at your ex wifes his mom controlling he doesn't eat healthy. Take out the pressure and let your son develop his own relationship with food.", "Nta, but he may have food sensory issues. I'm not autistic but there's some foods that I refuse to eat", "NTA. You are not forcing him to eat it all, just a sample of it, if he truly doesn't like it he can make himself something else. This is not starving by any stretch.", "I think he's choosing to deal right now haha.", "this causes trauma around food", "I disagree. He is offered food, and asked to take \"no thank you\" bites of each food. If he doesn't like it, he can refuse the meal and make a pb&j or something else. This is how healthy relationships with food start after being indoctrinated with \"fast foods\" and crap begins. I was raised the same as OP with eat what's on your plate. I chose differently with my kids and if they didn't like a particular veggie, they were given a fruit option. If they didn't like any of the meal after trying a bite, they could grab a ham and cheese or pb&j, not really unreasonable. Most 4 y/os can construct a perfectly edible sandwich or healthy snack. An 11 year can very well make something edible for himself.", "Eleven-year-old kids should at least be able to make a sandwich. OP isn't making his son prepare a full course meal by himself.", "If an 11-year-old can't make a sandwich for himself, he's got bigger problems than only wanting pizza and nuggs.", "...please read the post before writing an ignorant comment.", "He isn't autistic. He's been assessed three times.", "OP stated that he\u2019s already been assessed thrice.", "How are so many people not reading the damn post?", "I try not to fight, but he wants to. I ignore as much as I can but he constantly whines and yells about dinner.", "This is the way", "I would agree. However, something is off because this seems to be an only dinner struggle. He eats breakfast, lunch, and snacks with no problem, so it may be a power play but on the son's part and specifically about dinner. I think that his mom has a really big role here and if she changed what she said to son, that would go a long way (not saying that will ever happen but just that I think that is what would change the dynamic).", "Yeah I agree. Maybe not the frozen food he prefers, but OP should stock some reasonably healthy food that's ready to eat and has some protein. String cheese, yogurt, deli meat, nuts, fruit, etc. If he doesn't like dinner, he can eat that and remove the battle.", "He's been assessed three times. I feel like someone else would have picked up on that, no?", "The kid is not autistic and his mother feeling that he is not a diagnosis.", "Maybe you should read the post again, nice and slow so you don\u2019t miss all the details that you missed before.", "Idk if you can read but they tested him 3 times", "The child has been assessed three times and determined not to be autistic.", "Yeah, I'm sure the ex wife knows better than the 3 specialists.", "Op said the kid has been assessed 3 times though", "Are you missing the part where they got him assessed by doctors 3 times???", "Weed mostly.\n\nOur custody lawyer is aware, but no laws are being broken. The food she is feeding him isnt illegal even if it isn't healthy.", "I think she sees herself in him because she is autistic. She likes having something that is \"theirs\".", "Late diagnosis can create a lot of unresolved trauma. I'm not saying she's right that he's autistic, but if she's genuinely concerned that he is, she understandably wants him to be diagnosed sooner rather than later so he doesn't have to struggle longer than he has to. Ask me how I know. (I agree that if he's been assessed three times and deemed neurotypical, she's been proven incorrect, just answering your question on why she probably is seeking a diagnosis.)", "I think some adults genuinely forget that kids do sometimes just know they don't like a food. It doesn't matter how many times I try raw tomatoes, I'm not going to like them. Because I'm an adult, people believe that's a valid taste preference. When I was a kid, nobody would believe me and often pressure me to swallow some. \n\nI totally agree in not catering to the demand to only eat pizza and chicken fingers, but the \"eat one bite of everything\" rule seems mean to me when we're talking about foods a child already knows they dislike.", "He's 11. It's not like this is new to him. He knows what to expect at Dad's and he actively fights about it.", "Yep, NTA, at this point I'd be seeking legal counsel for full custody and a spectrum/autism assessment by a court appointed doctor. Whilst also bring in the 3 different doctors you already had assess him, and any she had assess him. (If any, and if she's just making the assessment herself because she read about autism on Facebook that one time.)\n\nIt almost sounds like munchausen by proxy that she's convincing him he's autistic and has these issues. \n\nGet your son out of that woman's hands and limit contact with her to supervised visits.", "I think it\u2019s beyond being mad he doesn\u2019t get what he wants. He has his mom in his ear saying he doesn\u2019t have a choice on what to eat *because* he\u2019s \u201cautistic\u201d, when three different professionals say he isn\u2019t. And then dad is giving him options, which is what I think the right approach here is. But we\u2019re all adults, and he is a child having his mom project her own issues onto him. I don\u2019t think the child has the maturity to be responsible here. If he lives full time with OP, or if mom and OP were on the same page here, then yeah, child is being stubborn. But mom is doing him a huge disservice here. \n\nThe problem is that OP can\u2019t fix this solo. I think his approach is ideal here, under other circumstances. But with mom not on board, this could backfire and cause food issues or just normal parent-child resentment. \n\nThis is a lot more delicate a situation than it should be, and the problem is mom. OP needs to work with her, as difficult as she\u2019s being, because his approach won\u2019t work right now with mom\u2019s interference.", "Agreed. You should both go with your son to the doctor and get on the same page surrounding his diagnosis (or lack thereof). A paediatric dietitian can help with how to transition your son to wider variety of foods and ensure he\u2019s eating a balanced diet no matter where he\u2019s living. You might also benefit from mediation where you set up some ground rules surrounding food and how you both communicate with your son about each other.", "He's not autistic.  He's been tested.", "Can you read\u2026? They had the kid assessed 3 times and he DOES NOT have autism.", "He's been tested/assessed the times, and each time they said he's not on the spectrum. This isn't autism.", "Except the kid doesn\u2019t have autism, according to THREE separate assessments. Or are you saying all those doctors are wrong?", "It says in the story that he has been tested and is not autistic.  Even if he is, kids need proper nutrients.  I'm sure dad would find a way to give him a healthy alternative IF he had autism...which he doesn't.", "He's not autistic, his mom just thinks he is.", "OP says he was assessed thrice and wasn't diagnosed.

Thank you.", "He said that he does give him other choices but not what he wants because he doesn't buy that and son is not happy.", "I don't intend to. I want him to try it before eating something else, but even then he wants foods we don't stock.", "They have 3 times and he\u2019s not", "OP says they've had him assessed three times and all three times the trained professional has said he's not autistic", "OP says right in the post that his son has been assessed three times. So he has had him assessed and every time the assessors said he does not have autism", "OP said his son was assessed three times and was judged not to be autistic.", "He's been assessed three times. He isn't autistic.", "They've had him assessed three times.", "And this is where my mother would give me another choice, calmly spoken: Stop whining and screaming at me or you can go to your room (without any electronic devices) until you can speak to me like a civilized human being.", "Often, psychologists with outdated ideas of how autism presents will misdiagnose kids. Happened to me, happened to like half the autistic people I know. Results can be skewed, especially if at least one parent is reluctant to view their kid as autistic. I don't think the possibility is completely off the table.", "Often, psychologists with outdated ideas of how autism presents will misdiagnose kids.

And it's a sucky experience to feel different and not know why or feel like no one is listening. Still, 3 times right now...might be better to wait and reassess later. \n\nEven still, the food thing makes sense. Honestly we try it with our kid but we're extremely bad at enforcing it especially when we're not great either.\n\nNTA btw...", "I don't have the space for him full time, and we're in a state where he can make his choices soon. I don't want to take him from his mom, either.", "That\u2019s a good point, I think when I wrote my comment I was too focused on the situation between OP and his son and not enough on the situation between OP and his ex. I agree with you though that OPs method won\u2019t work unless his ex gets on board. Thanks for giving another perspective", "Whatever it is that makes him easy like this, you can't just make him tough it out. Some kids/ people just have safe foods. Talk to a doctor about how to help him get a proper diet rather than just not having your kids eat enough at all I the meantime.  If the only way to get your kids belly full is with nuggets, that kid better have some nuggets lol. Make him eat once bite of a vegetable to earn it, build up to variety, but if your kid isn't eating a large enough quantity of food at your house \"in the name of health\", it's actually pretty unhealthy for the kid", "THIS", "Relax I fixed it", "I fixed the comment my brother relax", "Does it matter what diagnosis it counts as or does it matter what the kids struggles with? Clearly the kids struggle with food", "That doesn't mean the kid is immediately neurotypical.... and honestly it doesn't really matter what the reason is. The kid should have enough food in a day", "Sorry, poor reading comprehension on my part. NTA. Sounds like you have a rough co-parenting situation.", "It matters if the kid has autism and he isn't getting treatment. It sounds like that's not the case, though.", "Technical op doesn\u2019t give other options himself. He tells his son to try it and if he wants something else he can make it himself. Its up to the son to feed himself if he doesn\u2019t like the food after trying it.", "Oh my bad most have missed that", "He'll just yell from his room haha. We do try. When its warm we leave him in his room and eat outside but I do feel a little bad.", "Kids don't know how to express their emotions like \"civilized human beings\" until you teach them. Sorry your mom did that, but telling them to figure it out on their own or get out of your space isn't good parenting.", "No, apparently not. She's not telling people he's autistic or lying about it. She's very much \"he has these signs, so he's autistic like me\". She was assessed like five times before she was diagnosed, but she doesn't seem to understand the difference between male and female diagnosis. Women are under diagnosed bc misogyny, which won't effect our son.", "IMO, at the moment, OP is definitely NTA. But I think pushing on this without having some kind of a middle ground with mom would be a bad idea. But it really shouldn\u2019t be this hard. Mom needs to sort her own issues out, but unfortunately, OP is going to have to work with her until she does.", "I was a picky eater as a kid. I was made to tough it out. I\u2019m all better now.

I think he just knows how to get his own way with his mom.", "They state that he does. They state that he\u2019s absolutely fine with breakfast and lunch, and gets snacks throughout.

Lunch is at 1pm and breakfast is at 8am - dinner is at 6pm, so even when he skips it its not that long. He's also allowed one snack before bed he usually has (although its not huge - usually like a gogurt or something).", "You'd know better than me, since you're living in it, but my general experience says \"maybe not yet. Give it more time.\"", "I'm just saying there's not just one possibility, like it is possible they have food issues", "And?  I didn\u2019t like spinach as a kid. Still do not. No one ran to put a label on it. I just feel people need to stop putting a label or a diagnosis on everything and everyone. It\u2019s kids being kids.", "I also think it\u2019s fair that we tell our kids we\u2019re not running a restaurant.. if you know a kid doesn\u2019t like something, don\u2019t force the issue.. that\u2019s cruel, but offering 10 different options is wrong too. Be a parent not a friend. I never forced my kids. I did ask them to at least try something. But, then again I offered and started my kids out on healthy options. Not just nuggets and pizza like so many do now. Because it\u2019s \u201ceasier \u201c."]}
