Eventually he'll learn that he can either eat what you provide or deal with the situation.", "I know you mean well, but I don't see how him not eating at all is better than eating food you disagree with. This isn't on the same level as eating moldy food, but it's also not how you help children form healthy relationships with how they consume it. NAH, but you could go about it in a better way that's not just \"do what I say or you can't have dinner.\" (\"Allowing\" an 11-year-old to prepare himself dinner when he obviously doesn't know how to do it to your standard isn't an appropriate alternative.)", "NTA. You aren\u2019t starving him, he can make himself something else. Good job! It\u2019s hard to break the junk food habit with kids.", "[deleted]", "NTA.  It is the role of the parent to feed the child nutritious food, which you are doing.  The only advice I will give you is that you don't fight about it.  Don't drive a wedge between the two of you.  If he doesn't want to eat it just let it go.  Don't give in, but don't fight over it.", "Kid is not starving by any stretch.  \n\nAlso, kid has an option of eating something else. \n\nNTA", "NTA  - This is on the other side of the planet from \"letting him starve.\"  You've provided him food, and you've also got food that he can make if he doesn't want what's provided.  Your ex needs to get a grip and it wouldn't hurt her to learn that she's making your son's life, and the lives of everyone around him, harder with the tantrum enabling.", "NAH (yet).  BUT I\u2019d try to make at least one dish in the meals that you know he will eat .  Most kids will eat some kind of rice, potato (not fries) or pasta or have at least some veggie they like.\n\nAnd stop the \u201cone bite\u201d rule. Stop fighting him at all and act like you don\u2019t give AF whether he tried it or not.   Take the stress out of meal times and make them enjoyable.  \n\nHe\u2019s old enough to help in the kitchen as is the 9yo (with limits), get them involved in choices and preparations.   Make Food Fun Again should be your motto.", "NTA\n\nIf he were 6, sure it might be different. But at 11, he's plenty old enough to make himself a sandwich or a bowl of cereal or a vegetable plate if he doesn't like what you've made, especially since you've had him tested for autism and got a \"no\" response. Again, it would be different if you just insisted he wasn't because you don't want him to be, but you've done the legwork here.\n\nWhat you might do, which might make things easier, if see of there are healthier versions of his garbage food you can make together. Like, maybe no frozen pizza, but something with fresh ingredients on a flatbread. No Tyson blended chicken nuggs, but chop up some breasts and do a light fry. Or try grilled.", "NTA. You are trying to introduce healthy eating habits. However going slow maybe a better approach. You know that your ex feeding him garbage, so it is worth to spend some extra effort finding what else he will eat instead of forcing your food on him.", "NTA. He's 11, not 4. He'll be a teenager soon. And it's not like you're telling him \"eat everything or don't eat\", you're saying \"eat a few bites or cook something for yourself\" giving HIM the option to fix the situation if he's unhappy. If he refuses, then that's on him.\n\nThe best parenting advice I ever heard was \"you aren't raising children, you're raising functional adults\". I think you are giving him a lot of autonomy in this situation and it doesn't hurt to put the idea in his head now that he can't eat junk for every meal. Keep doing what you're doing. I think he'll be a better adult for it in the long run.", "Soft YTA.  I agree with the generally principle of having kids try a variety of foods to develop and expand their palates.  Plus, as he gets older, your son will end up in social situations where he will be expected to eat something that may not be entirely to his taste, and it\u2019s good to learn how to do so without making a scene over your dislike of it. \n\nThat said, because of the custody situation I think should adapt your parenting methods on this to the reality of your son\u2019s situation.  I agree with having him try a bite of everything and then being allowed to make something else if he dislikes it, but I think you should have food in for him to make that you know he does like/eat.  \n\nRight now you are turning food into a power play with your son, which you will lose since you can\u2019t actually force him to eat.  Take that dynamic out of it and you\u2019re more likely to have long-term success with getting your son to eat a healthier and more diverse diet.", "You can have sensory issues without being Autistic.", "NTA. By any chance are your sons \u201csafe foods\u201d really his mother\u2019s safe foods? She definitely sounds like she\u2019s projecting her autism and preferences onto him despite him not being autistic. I think you\u2019re safe to stay the course. He\u2019s eating two solid meals plus snacks, he has the option to make himself something which at 11 he is capable of doing, and he isn\u2019t being forced to do anything other than try the food. My parents would call it the \u201c1 polite bite\u201d if you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t eat it but you tried it.", "NTA. But I'd speak to a dietician for advice as ideally there should be a middle step to get them to eat healthier, even if just a little bit.", "NTA\n\nI was once a picky eater when I was young. I would cry when I don't like the food (most of the time, vegetables). My parents didn't force me to eat---either I eat the food being served or don't eat at all and be hungry. Then when I was a teen (still a picky eater), I was able to earn some money from summer jobs, so whenever I don't like the food being served, I'd buy bananas, and that's what I'll eat, together with rice.\n\nWhen I started college, I began tasting vegetables little by little, liked them and eat them. When I graduated from college, I realized my palate has completely change because I now eat almost all kinds of food, be it vegetables, meat, seafoods, fruits, etc.. My mom was even surprised when she visited me, because she saw me eating the kind of foods that I used to hate.\n\nYou are doing fine with your kid. I believe someday, his palate will change and will eventually like foods that he used to hate. But it's good that you are teaching him to eat balanced and well seasoned foods. He's old enough to prepare his own food if he doesn't like what's being served.", "[deleted]", "Have you discussed the situation with your custody lawyer, because what she is doing is truly detrimental to your son's health, and it needs to be stopped.

However, I do disagree with him being required to take a bite of everything.", "NTA Why would someone with autism WANT their child to be autistic? Maybe get some hate here, but why, after 3 series of tests, is she insisting he is autistic? You want your kids to eat a well balanced meal. See nothing wrong with this. The types of food he wants are fine for a young kid, occasionally, but a constant diet of snack foods? Unhealthy.", "NTA, your ex is enabling bad habits", "Forcing children to take a bite puts you in AH territory. If he doesn\u2019t want it, just leave it at that. He\u2019ll eat when he\u2019s hungry. A lot of kid\u2019s experience sensory issues with new foods. He\u2019ll get there in his own", "NTA. I'm more concerned about the mother's behavior and I'd even go so far and talk to a lawyer about it, because it's not healthy that she keeps telling him that he's autistic. Neither are her food choices.", "I think that fact that you aren\u2019t forcing him to eat the whole plate, instead saying he has to try it but if he doesn\u2019t like it he can have something else, is the key here. You are giving him options. He\u2019s just mad because he\u2019s not getting exactly what he wants. NTA", "NAH. Picky eater here (52f). I was told by my parents that I had to at least have one or two bites of something I didn't like, or I could make myself a PB&J. It's hard for some kids to try new foods, but I do think you're going about it mostly correctly. The problem I see is constantly making it a struggle between you and your son. This can lead to him having an unhealthy relationship with food, and you don't want that.\n\nNext time he has a doctor's appointment, take time off work and meet ex there. Go into the room with them and air your concerns with the doctor. If you aren't able to get into the appointment with them, then send an email to the doctor with your concerns. Try to find out workable solutions for everyone.\n\nAlso, talk to a lawyer about custody arrangements. What ex is doing doesn't rise to the level of abuse, but there is some harm being done with her constantly letting him eat junk food and convincing him he's on the spectrum and that he somehow \"deserves\" to eat however he wants because of it.\n\nIt may be that because she's on the spectrum (you didn't specify what functioning level), she's unable to continue having primary custody of him. Just because someone with ASD is high functioning, doesn't mean they're able to make the proper decisions needed when raising a child.", "ESH. \n\nThis is honestly a difficult situation. The biggest problem is between you and your ex. You're supposed to be co-parenting and your child is suffering because of it. Having two completely different sets of rules at different parents houses is extremely hard for a child. If you had your child full time I would completely agree with your approach. I did something similar for my child as he grew up and he's a great eater. However, my nieces and nephews are extremely picky and impossible to cook for. I have to accommodate them when they come over and make sure I have something I know they will eat. Granted the situation is completely different because this is your child. The problem I see is that everything you've worked hard to achieve is lost by the time he goes back with his mom. And honestly this is a symptom of a larger problem because his mother is reinforcing that this is not something he is choosing but something that is part of him due to autism. You're going completely against that and telling him it's his choice what to eat. \n\nI think a softer approach is needed. He's old enough to make his own choices to a certain extent. I would recommend making some food he is used to available and rewarding him for choosing food that's outside of his normal food. Get him to want to try new food rather than putting him in the difficult situation of being forced to eat food that his mother has reinforced that he shouldn't be forced to eat. \n\nUltimately, something needs to be done about your ex. Telling your child that they are something there not is a dangerous road and that should be looked at as the major issue. What food your child eats is nothing compared to being told they're autistic when they're not.", "Yta. You can't control it like this and just because it worked for one child doesn't mean it'll work for another. If he only eats certain foods and you're not providing those foods just because u think this kid should be able to tough out whatever food issues he has, then yeah you're starving your kid.  \n\nEdit he doesn't have autism but that didn't mean he's fully neurotypical or doesnf have textural issues", "NTA.  He is eating two meals plus snacks, but testing boundaries at dinner.  He isn't actively dying or starving!  Perhaps it's time to get some intervention going and get mom to speak to a nutritionist to inform her the damage she is doing to your child.  Good luck!", "Info: Is your son actually diagnosed as autistic? If you're ignoring/dismissing your son's condition that would make you TA.", "NTA. Your intentions aren't bad but your actions could be a lot more efficient. Incentivize him to eat his food in some way, like for example if he really likes a TV show tell him the main character loves this food, which can be a spark to get him to eat it, or anything that would *want* to do it. Once you figure out what it is, you have won half the battle. Right now this might not be a problem, but later on he might develop eating disorders or eating habits/insecurities which wouldn't benefit him.", "NTA.  Letting him maintain shitty eating habits will do significant damage to him long term.", "NTA. Its good youre trying to teach him how to eat healthy. He needs that. You arent starving him. Theres food just not what hr usually eats at mom's.", "NTA\n\nIf he's \"starving\" it's by his own choice. There's food available and already made. I do something similar with my four year old and two year old. They can eat what I make or nothing. Go figure when they get hungry they eventually eta what I've made with a \"wow it is yummy\". Kids are stubborn but there's no need for anyone to only eat nuggets and pizza", "I'm sort of sitting the fence on this, not sure whether to lean toward a soft NTA or a soft YTA. Every kid is different and just because he's not autistic doesn't necessarily mean there aren't other sensitivities or behavioral issues here. I 100% believe you should be trying to get your son to explore new foods, but I wonder about the toughness of the approach you're describing. My uncertainty about how to vote here comes from my own personal experience with my autistic kid brother. Our mom was like your ex-wife and never challenged his \"safe foods\", so when she died and I got him, he was only eating pizza, chicken nuggets, grilled cheese or peanut butter sandwiches. I started a soft push to encourage him to try new things. I allowed him to choose what he was trying and reinforced the rule \"if you don't like it, you don't have to finish it\". It was a slow transition, but now his diet is far more varied and he's not afraid of trying new things. I tried to take a positive approach, almost a happy exploration into the unknown (if that makes sense). I think you're negative approach is going to make trying new things a bad experience.", "Nta.  \n\nHe is not starving, and he will not starve.   \n\nHe will cave and eat your food long before he ever starves.", "I don't think you're an asshole but why make the dinner table a warzone? I prepared one meal for dinner and when my children were younger I told them if they didn't like it, eat a bowl of cereal. My children laugh about it now and all the foods they wouldn't eat then and love now.", "Info, why haven't you gotten him assessed? I know you don't believe he's autistic and you might be right however you and yours ex aren't qualified to make the call.", "Our rule was always three bites of everything on your plate and then you can eat a peanut butter sandwich. I think you're being more than fair, especially if you always have one side dish that is plain like corn or peas or mashed potatoes. NTA but maybe give him the option of choosing one meal per week that he helps prepare. If he's willing to learn to make homemade chicken strips or fresh pizza I think he deserves to get to eat it.", "NTA\n\nBut any chance you can motivate him to get an interest in food? Pizza and chicken nuggets arn't soooo bad if you make it at home from scratch and maybe you can encourage your son to prepare the pizza with you and try to encourage him to experiment with the food. You can also start with baking / making pudding etc if he likes this more. You can also start by making food for a \"food fight\" and then just throw it at each others etc. Just everything that allowes him to come in touch with food w/o pressure.  \n\nThe problem here is not only the eating, the eating is a symptom. He doesn't have access to a variety of food in his main home to explore his taste w/o his mom sitting in his ears and whispering \"pizza, nuggets, mc donalds\".  Your son is experiencing a lot of pressure around food. At yours its you guys who control he doesn't eat unhealthy and at your ex wifes his mom controlling he doesn't eat healthy. Take out the pressure and let your son develop his own relationship with food.", "Nta, but he may have food sensory issues. I'm not autistic but there's some foods that I refuse to eat", "NTA. You are not forcing him to eat it all, just a sample of it, if he truly doesn't like it he can make himself something else. This is not starving by any stretch.", "I think he's choosing to deal right now haha.", "this causes trauma around food", "I disagree. He is offered food, and asked to take \"no thank you\" bites of each food. If he doesn't like it, he can refuse the meal and make a pb&j or something else. This is how healthy relationships with food start after being indoctrinated with \"fast foods\" and crap begins. I was raised the same as OP with eat what's on your plate. I chose differently with my kids and if they didn't like a particular veggie, they were given a fruit option. If they didn't like any of the meal after trying a bite, they could grab a ham and cheese or pb&j, not really unreasonable. Most 4 y/os can construct a perfectly edible sandwich or healthy snack. An 11 year can very well make something edible for himself.", "Eleven-year-old kids should at least be able to make a sandwich. OP isn't making his son prepare a full course meal by himself.", "If an 11-year-old can't make a sandwich for himself, he's got bigger problems than only wanting pizza and nuggs.", "...please read the post before writing an ignorant comment.", "He isn't autistic. He's been assessed three times.", "OP stated that he\u2019s already been assessed thrice.", "How are so many people not reading the damn post?", "I try not to fight, but he wants to. I ignore as much as I can but he constantly whines and yells about dinner.", "This is the way", "I would agree. However, something is off because this seems to be an only dinner struggle. He eats breakfast, lunch, and snacks with no problem, so it may be a power play but on the son's part and specifically about dinner. I think that his mom has a really big role here and if she changed what she said to son, that would go a long way (not saying that will ever happen but just that I think that is what would change the dynamic).", "Yeah I agree. Maybe not the frozen food he prefers, but OP should stock some reasonably healthy food that's ready to eat and has some protein. String cheese, yogurt, deli meat, nuts, fruit, etc. If he doesn't like dinner, he can eat that and remove the battle.", "He's been assessed three times. I feel like someone else would have picked up on that, no?", "The kid is not autistic and his mother feeling that he is not a diagnosis.", "Maybe you should read the post again, nice and slow so you don\u2019t miss all the details that you missed before.", "Idk if you can read but they tested him 3 times", "The child has been assessed three times and determined not to be autistic.", "Yeah, I'm sure the ex wife knows better than the 3 specialists.", "Op said the kid has been assessed 3 times though", "Are you missing the part where they got him assessed by doctors 3 times???", "Weed mostly.\n\nOur custody lawyer is aware, but no laws are being broken. The food she is feeding him isnt illegal even if it isn't healthy.", "I think she sees herself in him because she is autistic. She likes having something that is \"theirs\".", "Late diagnosis can create a lot of unresolved trauma. I'm not saying she's right that he's autistic, but if she's genuinely concerned that he is, she understandably wants him to be diagnosed sooner rather than later so he doesn't have to struggle longer than he has to. Ask me how I know. (I agree that if he's been assessed three times and deemed neurotypical, she's been proven incorrect, just answering your question on why she probably is seeking a diagnosis.)", "I think some adults genuinely forget that kids do sometimes just know they don't like a food. It doesn't matter how many times I try raw tomatoes, I'm not going to like them. Because I'm an adult, people believe that's a valid taste preference. When I was a kid, nobody would believe me and often pressure me to swallow some. \n\nI totally agree in not catering to the demand to only eat pizza and chicken fingers, but the \"eat one bite of everything\" rule seems mean to me when we're talking about foods a child already knows they dislike.", "He's 11. It's not like this is new to him. He knows what to expect at Dad's and he actively fights about it.", "Yep, NTA, at this point I'd be seeking legal counsel for full custody and a spectrum/autism assessment by a court appointed doctor. Whilst also bring in the 3 different doctors you already had assess him, and any she had assess him. (If any, and if she's just making the assessment herself because she read about autism on Facebook that one time.)\n\nIt almost sounds like munchausen by proxy that she's convincing him he's autistic and has these issues. \n\nGet your son out of that woman's hands and limit contact with her to supervised visits.", "I think it\u2019s beyond being mad he doesn\u2019t get what he wants. He has his mom in his ear saying he doesn\u2019t have a choice on what to eat *because* he\u2019s \u201cautistic\u201d, when three different professionals say he isn\u2019t. And then dad is giving him options, which is what I think the right approach here is. But we\u2019re all adults, and he is a child having his mom project her own issues onto him. I don\u2019t think the child has the maturity to be responsible here. If he lives full time with OP, or if mom and OP were on the same page here, then yeah, child is being stubborn. But mom is doing him a huge disservice here. \n\nThe problem is that OP can\u2019t fix this solo. I think his approach is ideal here, under other circumstances. But with mom not on board, this could backfire and cause food issues or just normal parent-child resentment. \n\nThis is a lot more delicate a situation than it should be, and the problem is mom. OP needs to work with her, as difficult as she\u2019s being, because his approach won\u2019t work right now with mom\u2019s interference.", "Agreed. You should both go with your son to the doctor and get on the same page surrounding his diagnosis (or lack thereof). A paediatric dietitian can help with how to transition your son to wider variety of foods and ensure he\u2019s eating a balanced diet no matter where he\u2019s living. You might also benefit from mediation where you set up some ground rules surrounding food and how you both communicate with your son about each other.", "He's not autistic.  He's been tested.", "Can you read\u2026? They had the kid assessed 3 times and he DOES NOT have autism.", "He's been tested/assessed the times, and each time they said he's not on the spectrum. This isn't autism.", "Except the kid doesn\u2019t have autism, according to THREE separate assessments. Or are you saying all those doctors are wrong?", "It says in the story that he has been tested and is not autistic.  Even if he is, kids need proper nutrients.

Keep on keeping on. You\u2019re not starving him if he can make his own food after if her prefers, he\u2019s doing this to himself. \n\nI would say, have you shown him how to cook basics so he knows how to make food that isn\u2019t just stabbing a packet and throwing it in the microwave?", "INFO: what are the meals that you\u2019ve taught him to prepare for himself?", "You say he eats breakfast and lunch just fine? Is there a way to bring those foods as options at dinner time so that he has safe foods to eat that you're comfortable feeding him? Is there a way to expose him to what you're all eating but still make sure he can feel full at the table instead of feeling punished?\n\nFor the dinner time thing, my main advice would be to try to reduce the battle as much as you can. You're sensing that the plan you have right now might backfire and I can see multiple ways that it already is backfiring.\n\nFirstly, battles around mealtimes can limit bonding or actively damage the family bond. Bonding at mealtimes is the #1 goal of family dinners. Food in belly is a secondary benefit, at best. We COULD all graze all day and go about our lives and exist just fine calorie wise. We choose to come together at mealtimes and eat at the same table because the social, emotional, and cultural benefits for children are so immense. Just by being together as a family and chatting and telling stories. Counting bites and arguing and battling negates a lot of those benefits.\n\nSecondly, pressure to eat will almost always backfire and all it really does is give the child more tools and training in how to stubbornly refuse. Especially if the other parent isn't on board with the plan and rewards them for being stubborn at your house.\n\nThe goal isn't to have our kids eat X Y Z food today and tomorrow and the next time we see them. The goal is to expose our children to all the foods in our culture, all the fruits and vegetables they have available to them in stores, and the basics of cooking them. So when they're grown up and making their own choices, they won't have bad memories of being forced to eat peas and cabbage and avoid them at all costs as adults. They'll have neutral memories of peas and cabbage. They won't be confused by what a common vegetable looks like and have no clue how to cook it.\n\nI don't think you're an asshole, as feeding kids is hard even when you DO have all the variables in your control. You have several variables outside your control. But I think the knee-jerk reaction AGAINST Mom's parenting isn't a valid or long term solution and is only punishing your child. \n\nLong term, your son will go between households and see many role models. It's up to you to have the best bond that you can, so that when he's ready to, he can trust you to be the role model that he needs. \n\nGood luck!", "You are making every dinner time a fight with him. He\u2019s crying and fighting at every dinner time. Do you enjoy it ? Him carrying on ? Does your wife enjoy it ? Do your daughters enjoy it ? Does he enjoy this ? Is it an enjoyable family meal where everyone sits down together and talks about their day ?\n\nHave a think about whether enforcing your food rules is more important than teaching him that sharing food as a family is an enjoyable bonding experience.\n\nBecause it sounds to me that you\u2019re teaching him to hate sitting down for dinner with you. And within a couple of years he\u2019ll be old enough to stand in front of a judge, and say that he doesn\u2019t want to come to your house ever again.\n\nYou said it set you off that your parents approved and their food tactics were abusive. Guess what ? Forcing a child to eat a meal, or letting them go hungry, is abusive. No, he won\u2019t starve. But you are making him to go hungry overnight and yup, withholding food - that\u2019s abusive. No wonder your parents approve. \n\nBecause you\u2019re using force, not love, not understanding, not compassion. You\u2019re not trying to meet him halfway - its your way or the highway. \n\nQuestion: would you behave differently if he *had* been diagnosed with autism ? Would you behave differently if he was diagnosed with food or sensory sensitivities ? \n\n*How* would you behave differently ? What compromises would you make around food for him ? \n\nUltimately, what is your goal here ? Because if you think that behaving like this will encourage your son to eat a wide and varied diet, I fear you are badly mistaken. \n\nI think you\u2019re teaching him to hate sitting down to dinner. I think you\u2019re teaching him that his needs don\u2018t matter. I think you\u2019re teaching him that Daddy\u2019s house is a horrible place to be, and he gets to have a fight every night over dinner when he\u2019s over at yours. \n\nWhat would happen if you fed him pizza, or nuggets ? What would happen if you *made* pizza or nuggets with him ? How could you make eating dinner enjoyable and safe for him again ? Without him fighting or crying or going hungry ?\n\nI think that you think that your approach to food is healthy and wide ranging, but it sounds incredibly controlling and rigid to me. \n\nYour stepdaughter eventually got used to eating one way when you put her on a healthy eating regime.

By offering them hunger as an alternative to what you make ?\n\nYou said your parents put a plate of food in front of you until you ate it, even when it was mouldy. *It is not an improvement to withold food altogether if a child doesn\u2019t eat what you make.*\n\nFor God\u2019s sake give your children some meaningful choices for dinner or you\u2019ll end up with daughters with eating disorders, and a son who will refuse to see you at all. \n\nYTA.", "Please, please test if your son is a supertaster.

Food should be enjoyable and fun, so I think involving him more in the planning and preparing of the foods you are trying to get him to try and eat would be very beneficial and lead to him being able to have a better relationship with food, and I think it could also provide a bonding experience for you guys.

Just stop forcing him to take a bite. (Especially and not spit it out.) That's the struggle. If they serve food and he can eat it or not, they can completely not engage with him in the struggle since they aren't forcing him to do anything. He can have a fit on his own but if no one engages in his fit at all and just keeps happily eating and talking pleasantly he'll stop having fits.\n\nI've read a lot of the various advice, science, and experts on children's eating (I'm a parent with a psych degree, I just find it fascinating) and what I'd change is not forcing ANYTHING including the bites. Forcing kids to take the bite creates a negative association emotionally with the bite they are taking and is counterproductive. The advice is actually to encourage repeated TINY tastes (pea sized, not a full bite) at a time *outside* of mealtime if mealtime is a battle. (Though he may be too old for this, studies were on toddlers and younger kids who would try things for a sticker on a chart.) \n\nI don't think OP should provide pizza, nuggets, and frozen food all the time. Especially if the kid is having breakfast, lunch, and snacks, he's fine. And whatever he's having for breakfast, lunch, and snacks are in the house and he is allowed to make himself food so he's extra fine.\n\nHere are the suggestions I'd make: \n\n1) Try cooking with son. You can start by cooking things he'll like. Say we're going to make pizza dough then all make our own pizzas with whatever we want on them. Let him make one with just cheese and peperoni without comment or complaint. Have other stuff you and the other kids like, like bell peppers, mushrooms, etc and just make them around him. Make breaded chicken and fry it together sometime. Have him help cook at other times, but be clear he dosen't have to eat it. Just get him used to handling different ingredients. Take him grocery shopping and let him pick part of what you buy, or determine part of the menu. We're making fresh nuggets today, what fruit, vegetable, and starch should we get with it? How should we make that? Let him menu plan, shop, and help cook some meals. And tell him you want him to know how to make the things he likes when he dosen't like dinner, so practice with him. Practice making the things he eats for breakfast and lunch. Even if it's just a sandwich or whatever? Show him how to boil water and make pasta together, have him pick out some sauces he likes. Then someday you can cook sauce together, etc. (Obviously, it's a lot of work to do this every day, but sometimes.) \n\n2) Addition to 1, you can have him and his younger sister cook if they have a good relationship but put him in charge of some tasks since he's the oldest and they \"need his help\"/\"He's older and can show them how to do it\". (Only if this would make him feel proud/in control and not just annoyed.) Also, he can learn knife work/cutting, maybe he'd like that? You can ask him to cut up veggies and stuff for you, but don't tell him to eat them, just say he's practicing getting skilled with a knife/helping you out. You and other kids can much/try how they taste raw but don't try to coax him to. He can taste or smell spices to see which to add to the chicken etc. \n\n3) Serve food family style and let him serve himself what he does and dosen't want on his plate. Don't comment on him not taking or trying something. Don't comment on what he's eating at all. Don't engage in any sort of struggle with him about it. Happily talk about stuff with him and the other kids, and if he wants to pout just ignore the pouting. \n\n4) Are there any healthy safe foods for him that he does eat at other times during the day? You can include some of those as options on the table. Like plain chicken, frozen peas, apple slices, whatever. Does he like fruit? Could be bread too? Corn? Potatoes? Pasta with a meal? Other people can add sauce and veggies, meat to their pasta on their plates and he can have his plain with no pressure. \n\n5) If there is another context he can interact with or try the food, or the other kids can and he might want to be involved, that's great. This can include gardening, shopping, cooking, doing art with, etc. If he grew a plant, or picked it out, or made something he may be more inclined to try it. Especially if no one mentions he dosen't normally like that. \n\nAll that said, his mom's home does complicate things. But OP can make his home a place son can learn about food, cooking, and try different foods *if he wants* and *when he feels ready.* This way there is no negative feelings/associations around trying things. He'll be exposed to healthy eating and whole foods.", "Not really, idk how many times I\u2019ll make something, same ingredients it\u2019s just something like I used a different pasta and my 7yr takes one look and says \u201cI don\u2019t like that\u201d.

If OP and son can work together to figure out what these sensitivities are specifically, then son will will feel heard and validated for his sensitivities and may be more open to dad wanting him to expand his diet to being healthier. Maybe together they can find some foods the son likes fresh that could be incorporated in dinner meals. \n\nRight now the impasse is black and white thinking, if the family gets a little bit more creative in solving this problem to incorporate everyone\u2019s needs in the solution, then the son will be able to learn from his parents modeling flexibility.", "Yeah, feeding experts do not recommend that.

Children don't inherently know *how* to express what they're feeling or need and have to be taught. I think that's often missed, leading to a lot of adults who also don't know how to express their needs and instead get angry or break down, and who don't know how to teach it to their children.

I think if food had been presented to me in a more positive way and my parents had tried to accommodate me rather than wanting me to fit into societal standards, I'd have a lot better relationship with food as an adult.

Chicken nuggets -> breaded chicken. Frozen pizza -> flatbread with veggies and a meat option. Frozen fries -> potatoes.

The kid isn't trying to have a power struggle. The kid is trying to get food that he can comfortably eat. The only people making this into a power struggle are the adults.", "This is what I was leaning towards. OP has said that his son is allowed to make something for himself if he doesn\u2019t like what\u2019s being served, but also doesn\u2019t stock the foods the kid WILL eat. \nComing from someone who has been a picky eater forever (sensory issues, likely on the spectrum but not in a place where I can be evaluated currently), don\u2019t force the \u201cone bite\u201d thing. I would still suggest the one bite thing, but don\u2019t make it a rule. Don\u2019t make your kid get a whole plate made off the bat. Possibly let him take a small bite off your plate, or a utensil so he can get just enough that he can get a taste without the intimidation of a whole serving. If he likes it, then great he can make a plate with how much he thinks he can realistically eat. Also, mention ingredients in it that you know he has a history of liking. Sometimes the appealing ones are kinda hidden by other stuff, so knowing they\u2019re in there may help a bit. Maybe even include him in the cooking process. But the big thing is have something in your house that you KNOW your son will eat. Even just a bag of frozen nuggets would work. It\u2019s actually giving him an option to make something he WILL eat, as opposed to telling him to make something himself without having things he will eat in the house. Best way I can describe it is\nOP: \u201chey, why don\u2019t you try some of this? It has chicken in it!\u201d\nKid: \u201cno\u201d (idk how 11-year-olds talk but you get the point)\nOP: \u201cthat\u2019s ok, let\u2019s make you some nuggets real quick. And this is here if you decide you want to give it a try\u201d\nBasically take away the intimidation, and make it more on his terms. Having someone tell you over and over you have to try something doesn\u2019t help anything. You should suggest he tries it instead of having a rule that he HAS to try it. He very well may see you all enjoying what you\u2019re eating and decide \u201cI want to know what the fuss is all about\u201d.", "If the kid is starving himself, then this isn't just preference. Autism isn't the only reason a kid can have food sensitivities.\n\n'Eat this or starve' is forced feeding.", "I'm sorry but you can't possibly know if it's \"\"by his own choice,\" or not, unless you have medically evaluated the son.", "He isn't autistic. But thank you.", "Did you read the entire post? OP stated that the kid has been assessed three times and each time was determined to not be autistic.", "This is absolutely it. The mom is feeding the kid a medical \"excuse\" for him to eat junk.  Since he's a kid and likes eating junk, he's latching on to the excuse as a reason for him to only have junk, but an excuse of his own for a tantrum to get his way. He's absolutely old enough to not be having tantrums unless that behavior is being reinforced by being rewarded: tantrum = getting what he wants. \n\nBut there is no way the mom is just going to see reason and start working with OP for the child's best interest. If she was going to see the light, there wouldn't have been THREE autism assessments - the first one (so long as it was properly done) would have sufficed. My assumption is that the mom got the result of the first assessment, it didn't say what she wanted, so she started shopping around. Maybe under the guise of \"second opinion.\" Living similar BS right now though so feel free to call me out on projecting. \n\nI feel like poor primary parents rely on finding something \"wrong\" with the kid to cover up or excuse the obvious results of their bad parenting in the kids behavior and performance; and usually want something medically \"wrong\" so that it's basically an unassailable excuse for anything objectionable that may be observed. Kid has out of control meltdowns? Couldn't possibly be because primary parent has an unstable home life with no fixed address and random SO's coming and going in and out of the kid's life - must be autism and meltdowns because of being forced to eat foods that are not safe! Kid is performing poorly in school, doesn't seem to be retaining essential phonics rules for reading? Can't possibly be because the primary parent isn't giving the proper homework support, or constantly giving the kid screen time, no the kid must have ADD! Etc. (these are examples not intended to 100% follow OP's fact pattern, for those who want to pick me to pieces over the details)\n\nThe kind of person who will do this to their kid is not thinking of their kid. They're thinking of themselves.

Whether you intend it to be a punishment or not, he\u2019s experiencing it as one. \n\nI understand your desire not to keep frozen foods or \u201cunhealthy\u201d foods in your home, but you need to feed your son. He needs to feel like your home is a place where his needs are met. Have you tried involving him in the cooking process? Have you tried making any of his safe foods from scratch? \n\nAlso, non-autistic people can still have food issues.

My 10 year old is autistic and a very selective eater. I always have low sodium chicken tenders, eggs, frozen green beans and peas, and fresh fruit and veg that he likes in stock. He will usually eat some part of the dinner we prepare, but if he doesn\u2019t want to or is still hungry, we have taught him to make basic healthy meals in the air fryer or microwave. If I tried to pull the one bite rule on him, he\u2019d absolutely refuse to eat that food.

He\u2019s expecting more flexibility from an 11 year old who already has to navigate many aspects of two very different household cultures than he is from himself and his wife. Frozen veggies retain more nutrients than veg that has been shipped and stored fresh to sell at the grocery store. A big batch of chicken tenders can be made from scratch ahead of time with whole wheat breading and frozen to last a few months if he is truly intent on being an \u201cingredients\u201d family. Instead of mixing ingredients to create a final dish (like a casserole, goulash, or pasta sauce), they can be kept separate so that his son can choose which to put on his plate.

I needed professionals to tell me the same things my parents were trying to for me to really understand they really were just looking out for me.\n\nWith that said, my parents and I helped my brother with a very similar issue where he'd only eat pizza, nuggets, hot dogs, and ALL OF THE BREAD. Though it's nowhere near the same situation, I still think it could help.\n\nWe started by going to the grocery store and picking out and buying all of the ingredients to make a healthy, homemade pizza and breaded chicken.\n\nHave him help you make the pizza and show him how to bread the chicken and see how everything is made a few times until you trust him to do everything himself with your supervision until he's ready to do it without you. Move on to spaghetti and chicken parmesan. Work in more foods this way.\n\nOnce we're making our own real foods, we can learn how to bake!\n\nMake cooking fun for the whole family! I'm sure the girls would love to help, as well, if you ask them!\n\nWhen food is fun, we learn to try more things. Maybe ask the girls to tell him how *delicious* whatever they're eating is and ask him to try more things? My parents asked me to do the same thing and I actually got my brother to try so many things and actually like some of them!\n\nAny other family to get involved if he's still throwing a fit with you? Maybe he'll be more up to making pizza and cookies with Grandma or whoever?\n\nI'd also check out V8 Fruit and Vegetable juices! We love that stuff at my house! Tastes like fruit juice, but you're getting a serving of vegetables, too!\n\nI hope this helps!", "I do autism testing for my job, and I often see kids who were tested when they were younger and not given a diagnosis. \n\nIt's especially common when the child is tested at or before around age 2.5 and doesn't show many symptoms. Most professionals tend to err on the side of not giving a diagnosis and recommending the child be re-tested when they're older. \n\nThere are all kinds of tools and tests that try to make the diagnosing process objective--but it's not. It's based on the professional's observations and the parent's report (or the individual's report, depending on their age). Sometimes, kids are very good at masking at public places. In those cases, you should rely on parent report... but that doesn't mean all professionals will. And in particular, more \"old school\" professionals tend to have a more rigid view of what autism is. \n\nOoh here's a good ecample, I tested a kid once who was very clearly autistic. He'd been tested before and he wasn't given the diagnosis. Why? Because he asked the examiner about a ring he was wearing. Often, autistic people won't ask others for information. But... that doesn't mean they NEVER do it, EVER, in any instance. \n\nSo yeah I'm not saying OP's kid is autistic, but his sensory issues do seem severe. And most 11-year-olds aren't going to throw a tantrum and go to bed hungry, so I'm not sure OP's assessment that he's just spoiled by his mother is correct. And you don't have to be autistic to have sensory issues....", "Im sorry that this was your experience but we should start by trusting the doctors opinions first.", "Reality can be harsh and doesn't take into account our wants or even needs.", "He made that comment about 30ish minutes after I made mine, I was unaware.", "Especially when his \"room\" is a closet. It sounds like it's a large one but still, sending your kid to an upstairs closet while everyone else eats seems a bit worse.", "Yeah I do think there's some misogyny involved (because doctors are less likely to trust women's self-report), but it's also that autism presents differently in women than in men. \n\nBut a boy who masks a lot or is on the low end of level 1 autism is also likely to be misdiagnosed. \n\nI'm curious as to what other symptoms OP's ex has noticed in him. I really think he has legitimate sensory issues, even if he doesn't mean the criteria for a diagnosis. \n\nI think OP needs to do some research into \"autistic-like traits,\" which often happen in people who are related to an autistic person. The research is fairly new, but there are people who have these traits despite not actually meeting the cutoff for an autism diagnosis. He could very well have sensory issues but not have, say, problems with social communication. Sensory issues are also common with ADHD.  \n\nOP's son's response to being forced to take a bite of everything on his plate is really extreme. It's not typical for an 11-year-old to scream, have a tantrum, and refuse to eat until the next day at breakfast. Now, if he shows this behavior at other times, without a sensory issue, then maybe he is just being spoiled.", "Mmmm OP didn\u2019t say that she is telling his son that. He made one comment about her \u201creinforcing that [he\u2019s] a bad parent,\u201d but that isn\u2019t necessarily the same as her telling the child that he is a bad parent because of what he is doing. I\u2019m reading that as how OP feels about his ex-wife\u2019s \u201coutrage\u201d at the way food is approached in his household, not what is being said directly to the child. OP also indicated that the only issue is around food, and specifically dinner. So it strains credulity that mom is saying that OP is straight-up a bad parent, but only about this one thing. \n\nAnd even if you were to go ahead and assume that mom is saying to the child that OP is a bad parent about his approach to food, while that would be wildly inappropriate, even OP does not seem to indicate in his post that he thinks mom is doing anything *with the intention* of harming his relationship with their son, so no, I don\u2019t think this constitutes an alienating behavior. And there is absolutely nothing to indicate that it rises to the level of full-blown parental alienation.", "\"Maybe ask the girls to tell him how delicious whatever they're eating is and ask him to try more things?\"\n\nI'm not a fan of bringing other kids in to influence or reinforce behavior in their siblings, it may create an adverse reaction and introduce an unhealthy dynamic.", "I think this goes far past a picky eater though. The mom is actively conditioning her childs brain to make him think he 'needs' this junk food because she has him convinced he's autistic, despite doctors telling him he's not.  \nThis is a whole mess of issues and it goes way way past just compromising dinner meals imo.", "I think serving him one *healthy* food that he likes is the way. Not chicken nuggets which is backwards progress. Serve a serving of whatever he enjoys at breakfast/lunch/snacks - add some of that to his dinner plate along with the regular dinner foods.", "Another picky eater? If you haven't read my comment above yours, yet, you might find it could help you as well! You may not need a nutritionist, but it can't hurt to look up other ways to help your picky eater, if you haven't yet. Sometimes it's the simplest thing that has you literally slapping your forehead, but it ends up being a game changer.", "Ultimately she knows him better than they do, and they can still have wildly outdated and unreasonable opinions about how autistic people are supposed to be. A friend of mine just had her son rejected for an autism assessment because he smiles too much. When I was in Germany and had to be hospitalised due to an unrelated medical emergency, I was told by a doctor \u201cSie sehen nicht autistisch aus\u201d (\u201cYou don\u2019t look autistic\u201d). They\u2019re very very often full of shit.", "she's forcing autism on the kid", "Of course if it doesn't help, you don't push it. Find what works for you. I'm just saying it worked for us. I still get him to try new things every once in a while, but we became closer because of it. I'd never tease him or force him to eat anything he didn't want to. I'd only ask him once if he'd like to try something. I know there are kids that will pick on each other or even literally force food into each other's mouths and cover your mouth with their little hands to make you eat it while giggling like an evil little maniac. This obviously won't work with them.", "This is a very dangerous way to go about your child healthcare, she knows him as a person im sure, but she doest have medical education and she is extremely biased. She should trust what the doctors are telling her and if this proves to be inefficient them she should look for a different doctor because they do know better about human health them her. And if if the child is not autistic? What about the harm this can cause to him if he is raised like he was without necessity? The child health should be more important here them she trying to prove herself rigth or wrong.", "But does the kid really have these issues or has his mother convinced him he does and she enforces it? I think that's what we're questioning.", "I do a lot of outreach work with sex workers who lose their kids to vindictive dads who out them in court.  Sliding scale lawyers and legal aid exists.  Where is the kids GAL?    \n\n\nIf this was a mom going \"its not easy haha\" she'd have already been set ablaze.", "Technically / legally, you are.  In their eyes, your step child and new child are receiving preferential treatment.  That's not my personal opinion, but rather how 'they' tend to see it.  I have sympathy for you there.\n\nI don't know that your loss is mentioned anywhere in the post, so I'm unclear of why you downsized.", "How? He's fed and not being abused cps does not have rhe time or resources for this.", ">That sounds more like he just doesn't want to eat it instead of food sensitivities.\n\nActually, the way he can't explain it means it's more likely to be an actual sensory issue. Sensory issues are very hard to explain in words.", "Do you spend a lot of time in the medical community? You're really coming off as someone who's never had to consistently see doctors for anything other than a cold or broken bone.", "We have to remember it's a spectrum.  My daughter has had several examinations to assess the source of her struggles and when she was too young for self reporting I answered many many questions regarding her. And every single  one of the evaluators has said to me at one time or another that I am the one who knows my child best, so they weigh my observations heavily against the testing. \n\nThere's no one test to determine this sort of a diagnosis.  Every autistic person  is unique and has their own particular strengths and weaknesses.  I remember when she first had the MCHAT her ped they said that they would be comfortable giving a referral,  but she made such good eye contact it gave them pause, then went with the referral because I felt it necessary to look further. She was given services and made great strides, then as she entered  to school she had advanced so much the school district couldn't offer services. Did she leave the spectrum? No, she did not. But she was able to learn in the classroom and only layer it become  necessary to accommodate her particular needs as they developed.  \n\nThat said, any child can also have characteristics often found in autistic children without having the diagnosis themselves.  And sensory issues and food or texture struggles are are not uncommon.  So the ex may see what she sees as part of her autism in her child and want to treat him as if he is autistic because that is what helped her to address the same needs in her life. The therapies for an autistic sensory child are very close to what you would do with a NT sensory child.", "Right? Lol none of us like this.", "The girls room is already small. They're on bunk beds because two beds wouldn't fit. Our living room doesn't have the space for a curtain either, but he is more than welcome to sleep downstairs with us in the armchair. In his own words \"I would rather sleep in a kennel outside\" so he gets the closet.\n\nThe closet isn't big enough for my wife and I and the older two will not share. Its hard enough to get them to be nice when they're being supervised. In a room unsupervised? Someone would probably die.", "What a unique and amazing thing to do. I imagine that work must be very, very hard.", "My stepdaughter needed emergency surgery and I'd lost my job so we didn't have insurance. Had to sell our house and downsize to cover it.", "I am open to suggestions.", "This is what I\u2019m thinking. Very real food aversions are not exclusively an autistic trait.", "I have ADHD and I don't have any food issues, but I do have other sensory issues with noise and crowds. It's impossible to explain the feeling I have when I'm surrounded by a lot of noise besides \"idk I just hate it and I need to leave.\"\n\nSo yeah, the way he can't explain why he dislikes certain foods to me makes it seem more like an actual sensory issue, not just disliking a food.", "Yeah that person is particularly not well-versed in the psychological community. I do autism testing for my job. There are a ton of tools and resources out there that try to make the diagnosing process as objective as possible.... But at the end of the day, it's a subjective diagnosis."]}
