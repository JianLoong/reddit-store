Eventually he'll learn that he can either eat what you provide or deal with the situation.", "I know you mean well, but I don't see how him not eating at all is better than eating food you disagree with. This isn't on the same level as eating moldy food, but it's also not how you help children form healthy relationships with how they consume it. NAH, but you could go about it in a better way that's not just \"do what I say or you can't have dinner.\" (\"Allowing\" an 11-year-old to prepare himself dinner when he obviously doesn't know how to do it to your standard isn't an appropriate alternative.)", "NTA. You aren\u2019t starving him, he can make himself something else. Good job! It\u2019s hard to break the junk food habit with kids.", "[deleted]", "NTA.  It is the role of the parent to feed the child nutritious food, which you are doing.  The only advice I will give you is that you don't fight about it.  Don't drive a wedge between the two of you.  If he doesn't want to eat it just let it go.  Don't give in, but don't fight over it.", "Kid is not starving by any stretch.  \n\nAlso, kid has an option of eating something else. \n\nNTA", "NTA  - This is on the other side of the planet from \"letting him starve.\"  You've provided him food, and you've also got food that he can make if he doesn't want what's provided.  Your ex needs to get a grip and it wouldn't hurt her to learn that she's making your son's life, and the lives of everyone around him, harder with the tantrum enabling.", "NAH (yet).  BUT I\u2019d try to make at least one dish in the meals that you know he will eat .  Most kids will eat some kind of rice, potato (not fries) or pasta or have at least some veggie they like.\n\nAnd stop the \u201cone bite\u201d rule. Stop fighting him at all and act like you don\u2019t give AF whether he tried it or not.   Take the stress out of meal times and make them enjoyable.  \n\nHe\u2019s old enough to help in the kitchen as is the 9yo (with limits), get them involved in choices and preparations.   Make Food Fun Again should be your motto.", "NTA\n\nIf he were 6, sure it might be different. But at 11, he's plenty old enough to make himself a sandwich or a bowl of cereal or a vegetable plate if he doesn't like what you've made, especially since you've had him tested for autism and got a \"no\" response. Again, it would be different if you just insisted he wasn't because you don't want him to be, but you've done the legwork here.\n\nWhat you might do, which might make things easier, if see of there are healthier versions of his garbage food you can make together. Like, maybe no frozen pizza, but something with fresh ingredients on a flatbread. No Tyson blended chicken nuggs, but chop up some breasts and do a light fry. Or try grilled.", "NTA. You are trying to introduce healthy eating habits. However going slow maybe a better approach. You know that your ex feeding him garbage, so it is worth to spend some extra effort finding what else he will eat instead of forcing your food on him.", "NTA. He's 11, not 4. He'll be a teenager soon. And it's not like you're telling him \"eat everything or don't eat\", you're saying \"eat a few bites or cook something for yourself\" giving HIM the option to fix the situation if he's unhappy. If he refuses, then that's on him.\n\nThe best parenting advice I ever heard was \"you aren't raising children, you're raising functional adults\". I think you are giving him a lot of autonomy in this situation and it doesn't hurt to put the idea in his head now that he can't eat junk for every meal. Keep doing what you're doing. I think he'll be a better adult for it in the long run.", "Soft YTA.  I agree with the generally principle of having kids try a variety of foods to develop and expand their palates.  Plus, as he gets older, your son will end up in social situations where he will be expected to eat something that may not be entirely to his taste, and it\u2019s good to learn how to do so without making a scene over your dislike of it. \n\nThat said, because of the custody situation I think should adapt your parenting methods on this to the reality of your son\u2019s situation.  I agree with having him try a bite of everything and then being allowed to make something else if he dislikes it, but I think you should have food in for him to make that you know he does like/eat.  \n\nRight now you are turning food into a power play with your son, which you will lose since you can\u2019t actually force him to eat.  Take that dynamic out of it and you\u2019re more likely to have long-term success with getting your son to eat a healthier and more diverse diet.", "You can have sensory issues without being Autistic.", "NTA. By any chance are your sons \u201csafe foods\u201d really his mother\u2019s safe foods? She definitely sounds like she\u2019s projecting her autism and preferences onto him despite him not being autistic. I think you\u2019re safe to stay the course. He\u2019s eating two solid meals plus snacks, he has the option to make himself something which at 11 he is capable of doing, and he isn\u2019t being forced to do anything other than try the food. My parents would call it the \u201c1 polite bite\u201d if you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t eat it but you tried it.", "NTA. But I'd speak to a dietician for advice as ideally there should be a middle step to get them to eat healthier, even if just a little bit.", "NTA\n\nI was once a picky eater when I was young. I would cry when I don't like the food (most of the time, vegetables). My parents didn't force me to eat---either I eat the food being served or don't eat at all and be hungry. Then when I was a teen (still a picky eater), I was able to earn some money from summer jobs, so whenever I don't like the food being served, I'd buy bananas, and that's what I'll eat, together with rice.\n\nWhen I started college, I began tasting vegetables little by little, liked them and eat them. When I graduated from college, I realized my palate has completely change because I now eat almost all kinds of food, be it vegetables, meat, seafoods, fruits, etc.. My mom was even surprised when she visited me, because she saw me eating the kind of foods that I used to hate.\n\nYou are doing fine with your kid. I believe someday, his palate will change and will eventually like foods that he used to hate. But it's good that you are teaching him to eat balanced and well seasoned foods. He's old enough to prepare his own food if he doesn't like what's being served.", "[deleted]", "Have you discussed the situation with your custody lawyer, because what she is doing is truly detrimental to your son's health, and it needs to be stopped.

However, I do disagree with him being required to take a bite of everything.", "NTA Why would someone with autism WANT their child to be autistic? Maybe get some hate here, but why, after 3 series of tests, is she insisting he is autistic? You want your kids to eat a well balanced meal. See nothing wrong with this. The types of food he wants are fine for a young kid, occasionally, but a constant diet of snack foods? Unhealthy.", "NTA, your ex is enabling bad habits", "Forcing children to take a bite puts you in AH territory. If he doesn\u2019t want it, just leave it at that. He\u2019ll eat when he\u2019s hungry. A lot of kid\u2019s experience sensory issues with new foods. He\u2019ll get there in his own", "NTA. I'm more concerned about the mother's behavior and I'd even go so far and talk to a lawyer about it, because it's not healthy that she keeps telling him that he's autistic. Neither are her food choices.", "I think that fact that you aren\u2019t forcing him to eat the whole plate, instead saying he has to try it but if he doesn\u2019t like it he can have something else, is the key here. You are giving him options. He\u2019s just mad because he\u2019s not getting exactly what he wants. NTA", "NAH. Picky eater here (52f). I was told by my parents that I had to at least have one or two bites of something I didn't like, or I could make myself a PB&J. It's hard for some kids to try new foods, but I do think you're going about it mostly correctly. The problem I see is constantly making it a struggle between you and your son. This can lead to him having an unhealthy relationship with food, and you don't want that.\n\nNext time he has a doctor's appointment, take time off work and meet ex there. Go into the room with them and air your concerns with the doctor. If you aren't able to get into the appointment with them, then send an email to the doctor with your concerns. Try to find out workable solutions for everyone.\n\nAlso, talk to a lawyer about custody arrangements. What ex is doing doesn't rise to the level of abuse, but there is some harm being done with her constantly letting him eat junk food and convincing him he's on the spectrum and that he somehow \"deserves\" to eat however he wants because of it.\n\nIt may be that because she's on the spectrum (you didn't specify what functioning level), she's unable to continue having primary custody of him. Just because someone with ASD is high functioning, doesn't mean they're able to make the proper decisions needed when raising a child.", "ESH. \n\nThis is honestly a difficult situation. The biggest problem is between you and your ex. You're supposed to be co-parenting and your child is suffering because of it. Having two completely different sets of rules at different parents houses is extremely hard for a child. If you had your child full time I would completely agree with your approach. I did something similar for my child as he grew up and he's a great eater. However, my nieces and nephews are extremely picky and impossible to cook for. I have to accommodate them when they come over and make sure I have something I know they will eat. Granted the situation is completely different because this is your child. The problem I see is that everything you've worked hard to achieve is lost by the time he goes back with his mom. And honestly this is a symptom of a larger problem because his mother is reinforcing that this is not something he is choosing but something that is part of him due to autism. You're going completely against that and telling him it's his choice what to eat. \n\nI think a softer approach is needed. He's old enough to make his own choices to a certain extent. I would recommend making some food he is used to available and rewarding him for choosing food that's outside of his normal food. Get him to want to try new food rather than putting him in the difficult situation of being forced to eat food that his mother has reinforced that he shouldn't be forced to eat. \n\nUltimately, something needs to be done about your ex. Telling your child that they are something there not is a dangerous road and that should be looked at as the major issue. What food your child eats is nothing compared to being told they're autistic when they're not.", "Yta. You can't control it like this and just because it worked for one child doesn't mean it'll work for another. If he only eats certain foods and you're not providing those foods just because u think this kid should be able to tough out whatever food issues he has, then yeah you're starving your kid.  \n\nEdit he doesn't have autism but that didn't mean he's fully neurotypical or doesnf have textural issues", "NTA.  He is eating two meals plus snacks, but testing boundaries at dinner.  He isn't actively dying or starving!  Perhaps it's time to get some intervention going and get mom to speak to a nutritionist to inform her the damage she is doing to your child.  Good luck!", "Info: Is your son actually diagnosed as autistic? If you're ignoring/dismissing your son's condition that would make you TA.", "NTA. Your intentions aren't bad but your actions could be a lot more efficient. Incentivize him to eat his food in some way, like for example if he really likes a TV show tell him the main character loves this food, which can be a spark to get him to eat it, or anything that would *want* to do it. Once you figure out what it is, you have won half the battle. Right now this might not be a problem, but later on he might develop eating disorders or eating habits/insecurities which wouldn't benefit him.", "NTA.  Letting him maintain shitty eating habits will do significant damage to him long term.", "NTA. Its good youre trying to teach him how to eat healthy. He needs that. You arent starving him. Theres food just not what hr usually eats at mom's.", "NTA\n\nIf he's \"starving\" it's by his own choice. There's food available and already made. I do something similar with my four year old and two year old. They can eat what I make or nothing. Go figure when they get hungry they eventually eta what I've made with a \"wow it is yummy\". Kids are stubborn but there's no need for anyone to only eat nuggets and pizza", "I'm sort of sitting the fence on this, not sure whether to lean toward a soft NTA or a soft YTA. Every kid is different and just because he's not autistic doesn't necessarily mean there aren't other sensitivities or behavioral issues here. I 100% believe you should be trying to get your son to explore new foods, but I wonder about the toughness of the approach you're describing. My uncertainty about how to vote here comes from my own personal experience with my autistic kid brother. Our mom was like your ex-wife and never challenged his \"safe foods\", so when she died and I got him, he was only eating pizza, chicken nuggets, grilled cheese or peanut butter sandwiches. I started a soft push to encourage him to try new things. I allowed him to choose what he was trying and reinforced the rule \"if you don't like it, you don't have to finish it\". It was a slow transition, but now his diet is far more varied and he's not afraid of trying new things. I tried to take a positive approach, almost a happy exploration into the unknown (if that makes sense). I think you're negative approach is going to make trying new things a bad experience.", "Nta.  \n\nHe is not starving, and he will not starve.   \n\nHe will cave and eat your food long before he ever starves.", "I don't think you're an asshole but why make the dinner table a warzone? I prepared one meal for dinner and when my children were younger I told them if they didn't like it, eat a bowl of cereal. My children laugh about it now and all the foods they wouldn't eat then and love now.", "Info, why haven't you gotten him assessed? I know you don't believe he's autistic and you might be right however you and yours ex aren't qualified to make the call.", "Our rule was always three bites of everything on your plate and then you can eat a peanut butter sandwich. I think you're being more than fair, especially if you always have one side dish that is plain like corn or peas or mashed potatoes. NTA but maybe give him the option of choosing one meal per week that he helps prepare. If he's willing to learn to make homemade chicken strips or fresh pizza I think he deserves to get to eat it.", "NTA\n\nBut any chance you can motivate him to get an interest in food? Pizza and chicken nuggets arn't soooo bad if you make it at home from scratch and maybe you can encourage your son to prepare the pizza with you and try to encourage him to experiment with the food. You can also start with baking / making pudding etc if he likes this more. You can also start by making food for a \"food fight\" and then just throw it at each others etc. Just everything that allowes him to come in touch with food w/o pressure.  \n\nThe problem here is not only the eating, the eating is a symptom. He doesn't have access to a variety of food in his main home to explore his taste w/o his mom sitting in his ears and whispering \"pizza, nuggets, mc donalds\".  Your son is experiencing a lot of pressure around food. At yours its you guys who control he doesn't eat unhealthy and at your ex wifes his mom controlling he doesn't eat healthy. Take out the pressure and let your son develop his own relationship with food.", "Nta, but he may have food sensory issues. I'm not autistic but there's some foods that I refuse to eat", "NTA. You are not forcing him to eat it all, just a sample of it, if he truly doesn't like it he can make himself something else. This is not starving by any stretch.", "I think he's choosing to deal right now haha.", "this causes trauma around food", "I disagree. He is offered food, and asked to take \"no thank you\" bites of each food. If he doesn't like it, he can refuse the meal and make a pb&j or something else. This is how healthy relationships with food start after being indoctrinated with \"fast foods\" and crap begins. I was raised the same as OP with eat what's on your plate. I chose differently with my kids and if they didn't like a particular veggie, they were given a fruit option. If they didn't like any of the meal after trying a bite, they could grab a ham and cheese or pb&j, not really unreasonable. Most 4 y/os can construct a perfectly edible sandwich or healthy snack. An 11 year can very well make something edible for himself.", "Eleven-year-old kids should at least be able to make a sandwich. OP isn't making his son prepare a full course meal by himself.", "If an 11-year-old can't make a sandwich for himself, he's got bigger problems than only wanting pizza and nuggs.", "...please read the post before writing an ignorant comment.", "He isn't autistic. He's been assessed three times.", "OP stated that he\u2019s already been assessed thrice.", "How are so many people not reading the damn post?", "I try not to fight, but he wants to. I ignore as much as I can but he constantly whines and yells about dinner.", "This is the way", "I would agree. However, something is off because this seems to be an only dinner struggle. He eats breakfast, lunch, and snacks with no problem, so it may be a power play but on the son's part and specifically about dinner. I think that his mom has a really big role here and if she changed what she said to son, that would go a long way (not saying that will ever happen but just that I think that is what would change the dynamic).", "Yeah I agree. Maybe not the frozen food he prefers, but OP should stock some reasonably healthy food that's ready to eat and has some protein. String cheese, yogurt, deli meat, nuts, fruit, etc. If he doesn't like dinner, he can eat that and remove the battle.", "He's been assessed three times. I feel like someone else would have picked up on that, no?", "The kid is not autistic and his mother feeling that he is not a diagnosis.", "Maybe you should read the post again, nice and slow so you don\u2019t miss all the details that you missed before.", "Idk if you can read but they tested him 3 times", "The child has been assessed three times and determined not to be autistic.", "Yeah, I'm sure the ex wife knows better than the 3 specialists.", "Op said the kid has been assessed 3 times though", "Are you missing the part where they got him assessed by doctors 3 times???", "Weed mostly.\n\nOur custody lawyer is aware, but no laws are being broken. The food she is feeding him isnt illegal even if it isn't healthy.", "I think she sees herself in him because she is autistic. She likes having something that is \"theirs\".", "Late diagnosis can create a lot of unresolved trauma. I'm not saying she's right that he's autistic, but if she's genuinely concerned that he is, she understandably wants him to be diagnosed sooner rather than later so he doesn't have to struggle longer than he has to. Ask me how I know. (I agree that if he's been assessed three times and deemed neurotypical, she's been proven incorrect, just answering your question on why she probably is seeking a diagnosis.)", "I think some adults genuinely forget that kids do sometimes just know they don't like a food. It doesn't matter how many times I try raw tomatoes, I'm not going to like them. Because I'm an adult, people believe that's a valid taste preference. When I was a kid, nobody would believe me and often pressure me to swallow some. \n\nI totally agree in not catering to the demand to only eat pizza and chicken fingers, but the \"eat one bite of everything\" rule seems mean to me when we're talking about foods a child already knows they dislike.", "He's 11. It's not like this is new to him. He knows what to expect at Dad's and he actively fights about it.", "Yep, NTA, at this point I'd be seeking legal counsel for full custody and a spectrum/autism assessment by a court appointed doctor. Whilst also bring in the 3 different doctors you already had assess him, and any she had assess him. (If any, and if she's just making the assessment herself because she read about autism on Facebook that one time.)\n\nIt almost sounds like munchausen by proxy that she's convincing him he's autistic and has these issues. \n\nGet your son out of that woman's hands and limit contact with her to supervised visits.", "I think it\u2019s beyond being mad he doesn\u2019t get what he wants. He has his mom in his ear saying he doesn\u2019t have a choice on what to eat *because* he\u2019s \u201cautistic\u201d, when three different professionals say he isn\u2019t. And then dad is giving him options, which is what I think the right approach here is. But we\u2019re all adults, and he is a child having his mom project her own issues onto him. I don\u2019t think the child has the maturity to be responsible here. If he lives full time with OP, or if mom and OP were on the same page here, then yeah, child is being stubborn. But mom is doing him a huge disservice here. \n\nThe problem is that OP can\u2019t fix this solo. I think his approach is ideal here, under other circumstances. But with mom not on board, this could backfire and cause food issues or just normal parent-child resentment. \n\nThis is a lot more delicate a situation than it should be, and the problem is mom. OP needs to work with her, as difficult as she\u2019s being, because his approach won\u2019t work right now with mom\u2019s interference.", "Agreed. You should both go with your son to the doctor and get on the same page surrounding his diagnosis (or lack thereof). A paediatric dietitian can help with how to transition your son to wider variety of foods and ensure he\u2019s eating a balanced diet no matter where he\u2019s living. You might also benefit from mediation where you set up some ground rules surrounding food and how you both communicate with your son about each other.", "He's not autistic.  He's been tested.", "Can you read\u2026? They had the kid assessed 3 times and he DOES NOT have autism.", "He's been tested/assessed the times, and each time they said he's not on the spectrum. This isn't autism.", "Except the kid doesn\u2019t have autism, according to THREE separate assessments. Or are you saying all those doctors are wrong?", "It says in the story that he has been tested and is not autistic.  Even if he is, kids need proper nutrients.

Keep on keeping on. You\u2019re not starving him if he can make his own food after if her prefers, he\u2019s doing this to himself. \n\nI would say, have you shown him how to cook basics so he knows how to make food that isn\u2019t just stabbing a packet and throwing it in the microwave?", "INFO: what are the meals that you\u2019ve taught him to prepare for himself?", "You say he eats breakfast and lunch just fine? Is there a way to bring those foods as options at dinner time so that he has safe foods to eat that you're comfortable feeding him? Is there a way to expose him to what you're all eating but still make sure he can feel full at the table instead of feeling punished?\n\nFor the dinner time thing, my main advice would be to try to reduce the battle as much as you can. You're sensing that the plan you have right now might backfire and I can see multiple ways that it already is backfiring.\n\nFirstly, battles around mealtimes can limit bonding or actively damage the family bond. Bonding at mealtimes is the #1 goal of family dinners. Food in belly is a secondary benefit, at best. We COULD all graze all day and go about our lives and exist just fine calorie wise. We choose to come together at mealtimes and eat at the same table because the social, emotional, and cultural benefits for children are so immense. Just by being together as a family and chatting and telling stories. Counting bites and arguing and battling negates a lot of those benefits.\n\nSecondly, pressure to eat will almost always backfire and all it really does is give the child more tools and training in how to stubbornly refuse. Especially if the other parent isn't on board with the plan and rewards them for being stubborn at your house.\n\nThe goal isn't to have our kids eat X Y Z food today and tomorrow and the next time we see them. The goal is to expose our children to all the foods in our culture, all the fruits and vegetables they have available to them in stores, and the basics of cooking them. So when they're grown up and making their own choices, they won't have bad memories of being forced to eat peas and cabbage and avoid them at all costs as adults. They'll have neutral memories of peas and cabbage. They won't be confused by what a common vegetable looks like and have no clue how to cook it.\n\nI don't think you're an asshole, as feeding kids is hard even when you DO have all the variables in your control. You have several variables outside your control. But I think the knee-jerk reaction AGAINST Mom's parenting isn't a valid or long term solution and is only punishing your child. \n\nLong term, your son will go between households and see many role models. It's up to you to have the best bond that you can, so that when he's ready to, he can trust you to be the role model that he needs. \n\nGood luck!", "You are making every dinner time a fight with him. He\u2019s crying and fighting at every dinner time. Do you enjoy it ? Him carrying on ? Does your wife enjoy it ? Do your daughters enjoy it ? Does he enjoy this ? Is it an enjoyable family meal where everyone sits down together and talks about their day ?\n\nHave a think about whether enforcing your food rules is more important than teaching him that sharing food as a family is an enjoyable bonding experience.\n\nBecause it sounds to me that you\u2019re teaching him to hate sitting down for dinner with you. And within a couple of years he\u2019ll be old enough to stand in front of a judge, and say that he doesn\u2019t want to come to your house ever again.\n\nYou said it set you off that your parents approved and their food tactics were abusive. Guess what ? Forcing a child to eat a meal, or letting them go hungry, is abusive. No, he won\u2019t starve. But you are making him to go hungry overnight and yup, withholding food - that\u2019s abusive. No wonder your parents approve. \n\nBecause you\u2019re using force, not love, not understanding, not compassion. You\u2019re not trying to meet him halfway - its your way or the highway. \n\nQuestion: would you behave differently if he *had* been diagnosed with autism ? Would you behave differently if he was diagnosed with food or sensory sensitivities ? \n\n*How* would you behave differently ? What compromises would you make around food for him ? \n\nUltimately, what is your goal here ? Because if you think that behaving like this will encourage your son to eat a wide and varied diet, I fear you are badly mistaken. \n\nI think you\u2019re teaching him to hate sitting down to dinner. I think you\u2019re teaching him that his needs don\u2018t matter. I think you\u2019re teaching him that Daddy\u2019s house is a horrible place to be, and he gets to have a fight every night over dinner when he\u2019s over at yours. \n\nWhat would happen if you fed him pizza, or nuggets ? What would happen if you *made* pizza or nuggets with him ? How could you make eating dinner enjoyable and safe for him again ? Without him fighting or crying or going hungry ?\n\nI think that you think that your approach to food is healthy and wide ranging, but it sounds incredibly controlling and rigid to me. \n\nYour stepdaughter eventually got used to eating one way when you put her on a healthy eating regime.

By offering them hunger as an alternative to what you make ?\n\nYou said your parents put a plate of food in front of you until you ate it, even when it was mouldy. *It is not an improvement to withold food altogether if a child doesn\u2019t eat what you make.*\n\nFor God\u2019s sake give your children some meaningful choices for dinner or you\u2019ll end up with daughters with eating disorders, and a son who will refuse to see you at all. \n\nYTA.", "Please, please test if your son is a supertaster.

Food should be enjoyable and fun, so I think involving him more in the planning and preparing of the foods you are trying to get him to try and eat would be very beneficial and lead to him being able to have a better relationship with food, and I think it could also provide a bonding experience for you guys.

We have pasta, bread, most fillings/toppings, things like that. We're an ingredients household, though.", ">Right now you are turning food into a power play with your son, which you will lose since you can\u2019t actually force him to eat.\n\nYou can take the power play out of it without giving him the foods he wants he gets at moms. Just stop forcing him to take a bite. (Especially and not spit it out.) That's the struggle. If they serve food and he can eat it or not, they can completely not engage with him in the struggle since they aren't forcing him to do anything. He can have a fit on his own but if no one engages in his fit at all and just keeps happily eating and talking pleasantly he'll stop having fits.\n\nI've read a lot of the various advice, science, and experts on children's eating (I'm a parent with a psych degree, I just find it fascinating) and what I'd change is not forcing ANYTHING including the bites. Forcing kids to take the bite creates a negative association emotionally with the bite they are taking and is counterproductive. The advice is actually to encourage repeated TINY tastes (pea sized, not a full bite) at a time *outside* of mealtime if mealtime is a battle. (Though he may be too old for this, studies were on toddlers and younger kids who would try things for a sticker on a chart.) \n\nI don't think OP should provide pizza, nuggets, and frozen food all the time. Especially if the kid is having breakfast, lunch, and snacks, he's fine. And whatever he's having for breakfast, lunch, and snacks are in the house and he is allowed to make himself food so he's extra fine.\n\nHere are the suggestions I'd make: \n\n1) Try cooking with son. You can start by cooking things he'll like. Say we're going to make pizza dough then all make our own pizzas with whatever we want on them. Let him make one with just cheese and peperoni without comment or complaint. Have other stuff you and the other kids like, like bell peppers, mushrooms, etc and just make them around him. Make breaded chicken and fry it together sometime. Have him help cook at other times, but be clear he dosen't have to eat it. Just get him used to handling different ingredients. Take him grocery shopping and let him pick part of what you buy, or determine part of the menu. We're making fresh nuggets today, what fruit, vegetable, and starch should we get with it? How should we make that? Let him menu plan, shop, and help cook some meals. And tell him you want him to know how to make the things he likes when he dosen't like dinner, so practice with him. Practice making the things he eats for breakfast and lunch. Even if it's just a sandwich or whatever? Show him how to boil water and make pasta together, have him pick out some sauces he likes. Then someday you can cook sauce together, etc. (Obviously, it's a lot of work to do this every day, but sometimes.) \n\n2) Addition to 1, you can have him and his younger sister cook if they have a good relationship but put him in charge of some tasks since he's the oldest and they \"need his help\"/\"He's older and can show them how to do it\". (Only if this would make him feel proud/in control and not just annoyed.) Also, he can learn knife work/cutting, maybe he'd like that? You can ask him to cut up veggies and stuff for you, but don't tell him to eat them, just say he's practicing getting skilled with a knife/helping you out. You and other kids can much/try how they taste raw but don't try to coax him to. He can taste or smell spices to see which to add to the chicken etc. \n\n3) Serve food family style and let him serve himself what he does and dosen't want on his plate. Don't comment on him not taking or trying something. Don't comment on what he's eating at all. Don't engage in any sort of struggle with him about it. Happily talk about stuff with him and the other kids, and if he wants to pout just ignore the pouting. \n\n4) Are there any healthy safe foods for him that he does eat at other times during the day? You can include some of those as options on the table. Like plain chicken, frozen peas, apple slices, whatever. Does he like fruit? Could be bread too? Corn? Potatoes? Pasta with a meal? Other people can add sauce and veggies, meat to their pasta on their plates and he can have his plain with no pressure. \n\n5) If there is another context he can interact with or try the food, or the other kids can and he might want to be involved, that's great. This can include gardening, shopping, cooking, doing art with, etc. If he grew a plant, or picked it out, or made something he may be more inclined to try it. Especially if no one mentions he dosen't normally like that. \n\nAll that said, his mom's home does complicate things. But OP can make his home a place son can learn about food, cooking, and try different foods *if he wants* and *when he feels ready.* This way there is no negative feelings/associations around trying things. He'll be exposed to healthy eating and whole foods.", "Not really, idk how many times I\u2019ll make something, same ingredients it\u2019s just something like I used a different pasta and my 7yr takes one look and says \u201cI don\u2019t like that\u201d.

If OP and son can work together to figure out what these sensitivities are specifically, then son will will feel heard and validated for his sensitivities and may be more open to dad wanting him to expand his diet to being healthier. Maybe together they can find some foods the son likes fresh that could be incorporated in dinner meals. \n\nRight now the impasse is black and white thinking, if the family gets a little bit more creative in solving this problem to incorporate everyone\u2019s needs in the solution, then the son will be able to learn from his parents modeling flexibility.", "Yeah, feeding experts do not recommend that.

I'm not at all trying to say the kid shouldn't be trying new foods either way, just a lot of people I saw were saying \"what 3 times he's not autistic just projecting blah blah\" and I'm hoping OP doesn't totally dismiss the autism POSSIBILITY while still doing 100% what he's doing now", "I'd argue Munchausens at this point.", "Yes but op is not offering to make something else. Plus op did not mention if his son has been taught anything in the kitchen yet. An 11 year should be capable but doesn\u2019t mean he is. \n\nPlus he has to try it first. In order to make himself something.", "What is ed?", "He already eats like crap whenever he's with his mom. Besides, I doubt OP is holding back for special occasions like birthdays or something. I'll bet son orders off the kiddie menu anytime they go out to eat too cuz you know, nuggets and tenders.", "Umm...OP?\n\"Because she is convinced he's autistic she exclusively lets him eat his \"safe foods\". Frozen pizza, chicken nuggets, fries.\"", "No. He shouldn\u2019t have to eat something he doesn\u2019t want to. The other option is don\u2019t eat or make something yourself with the food Dad does have. Nothing wrong with that", "I like that as a compromise here. Or even have him make his own frozen nuggets to emphasize that it\u2019s his choice?", "Yeah\u2026.I just saw that. I\u2019m not going to shame people for going through financial difficulties, but damn.", "I mean gypsy had a bunch of unnecessary surgeries, like having her salivary glands and teeth removed, and was relegated to a wheelchair she didn't need. \n\n\n\nLike I get the concern but want to point out there is a bit of a difference between feeding a kid chicken tenders and removing their salivary glands.", "We have. Used to have a four bed house, lost it when I lost my job & step daughter needed emergency surgery. Which wasn't covered because I didn't have a job. Still waiting to see if Medicaid will pay us back for the expenses haha.", "Put him in your bedroom and you and the wife share a sleeper sofa.\n\nYou and your wife take the hall closet.\n\nLike what isn't fair is for him to live with an harmful parent (look up Munchausen by proxy if you haven't) because you didn't plan for his care before making the 4 year old.\n\nHe should be your priority here.  You're NTA how you're handling the food thing but TA for letting him be endlessly mistreated.  Involve professionals or the court to intervene if you really can't have him full time.  She's going to completely ruin him by adulthood, and then he'll \"have\" to live with you because he's \"autistic\" and \"too strong\" for her to handle.  \n\nShe's basically gonna turn your kid into Chris Chan and you're the only one who can do anything.", "If we send him up there, yeah.", "Eh, if mom allows it or caves to it, then it will be hard for the kid to unlearn.", "I always preferred, \"go to your room - you can come out when you're able to (speak calmly/use your big boy voice/whatever). \n\nI liked it because they get to be in control of how long they were in their room, hopefully teaching them that taking a calm down time is a good thing.\n\nNot that you asked, or even need this info, I just felt so darn clever about it that I like to share, lol", "I've tried figuring it out. He can't tell me why he doesn't like it, just that he doesn't, and he does like moms food (or grandmas food, but my ex mil is worse than my ex wife for food).", "People like to eat high fat, high sugar foods because eating those things causes us to crave it more.\n\nhttps://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/study-daily-consumption-of-a-high-fat-high-sugar-snack-alters-reward-circuits/", "OP should not offer to make a different meal for the child. The kid can make a sandwich. If they truly don\u2019t know, OP can take two minutes to teach them.", "Emergency Department.", "the way to convince him to eat new foods isn't to shame him for his likes and what his mom feeds him. he's a child. showing that you respect his likes while still encouraging him to try new things is the healthiest course of action.", "okay and i'm talking about what goes on at OP's house, not his ex's. if you want to be taken seriously in a discussion, maybe don't assume people are saying stuff they've never said?", "Dad gives him the option of making something for himself. He's not shoving the food down his son's throat, he's just saying that the kid has to try a bite of everything first. As a picky eater myself, I was made to eat a bite or two of something I didn't like because that was what my mom had fixed for dinner.", "I'm sorry to hear that.  Hopefully you can get some (or even all) of those costs reimbursed.  \n\nNTA for this situation, by the way.  I think you're handling the food situation at your house perfectly, exactly the way anyone I've worked with would recommend.  And I've worked in Children's Behavioral Health and ABA for years.  Funny thing, this would still be the correct approach to food for your son even if he was autistic.  See prior experience in ABA.\n\nAs for your ex, you do need to step in more there.  It doesn't change my vote, but you do need to find some way to force a reality check for your ex-wife.  She should not be trying to convince your son that he is autistic.", "Not to be that guy but. When a child whines and yells from the same trigger every time, and the behavior can't be altered, that's a bit of a marker of autism. Uncontrolled behaviors, food aversion, etc are symptoms.", "I've got to say that does sound extremely autistic of him.", "Unfortunately, the fact that mom gives in makes it basically impossible to stamp out that behavior by ignoring it. It being rewarded (ie given in to) at all, ever, reaffirms it. (Look up extinction burst.)\n\nYou might want to switch to positive rewards when he does behave, instead of ignoring when he doesn't, if mom isn't on board. (And create a few situations he will behave in to reward him and prime the pump at first. Maybe serve hand breaded chicken tenders one night?)", "Yeah, I think our parents were circling around the same concept, and I do think it gives kids some control in their \"punishment.\" It's not \"go to your room until I say so,\" it's \"go to your room until you want to/feel like you can behave.\"\n\nNow, what I DON'T like was the one time I apparently told my mom I didn't like her and didn't want her to be my mommy anymore, and then she said okay proceeded to stop doing anything but the bare minimum because \"well that extra thing you want sounds like something your mommy would do,\" until I apologized and asked her to be my mommy again. I actually don't even remember that incident, but it came up recently in a conversation, and it just sounds so horrifying that I'm unsurprised I apparently blocked it (or I might have just been too young to retain it this far into adulthood given the whole \"mommy\" aspect.)\n\nBut I don't think any parent is always going to do and say the right thing all the time. As a whole, I'm pretty happy with the person my upbringing helped me become.", "That sounds more like he just doesn't want to eat it instead of food sensitivities. \n\nCan you do healthier alternatives of the foods he likes, every once in a while, maybe if he knows he will also get foods he likes, helps him to eat foods that are not as good? For example home made oven pizza is much healthier than what fast food places offer.\n\nOr maybe ask if you son would want to participate in the cooking process in some way? Some kids may find eating foods easier when they have seen what goes into it and how it's made.\n\nIn my opinion you are not an ah for wanting your kid to eat healthier, there is probably just some miscommunication between everyone here.", "That's absolutely true as well. However knowing if the reason is sensitivities or fast food addiction can only be figured out by discussion", "Yup, like possibly offering homemade grilled nuggets or a cauliflower crust pizza.", "Lol, what are you talking about? That's the whole point of the post! He won't feed his son the same things his wife does. His kid and wife are flipping out. People are telling OP to stand his ground, and you said that causes food trauma.\n\n\"We, however, don't eat that. Every night either my wife or I make a well balanced and seasoned meal. The girls both have very varied palettes. My son, however, will not touch it. He will have full blown tantrums over dinner and demand \"moms food\".\n\nI do not give in. If he doesn't eat it, he doesn't eat. Its the same approach we took with my step daughter when we were transitioning her to a healthier lifestyle and now she eats fine.\n\nHe isn't required to finish his plate, but he is required to have a full bite of everything on his plate (and no spitting out food). If he doesn't like it he is welcome to make himself something else (but I will not, and it won't been frozen food as we don't stock it).\n\nMy ex is, obviously, outraged, and hates this. I feel like her reinforcing that I'm a bad parent is only making him want to fight me more. To be clear, he does eat - breakfast and lunch usually go down fine, alongside snacks throughout the day. He just misses dinner.\"\n\nIf you want to be taken seriously in a discussion, admit when you overlooked something in the post. Don't get all butt hurt when someone disagrees with you.", "He could also just have sensory issues around food, not necessarily autism.", "This is a child who lives in two homes that seem wildly divergent. No consistency also creates this behavior. Three professional assessments is fairly thorough.", "Thanks. This is correct.", "sounds like the mother encourages it tho and tells him stuff like \"youre autistic so this is what you should do\". happened to me. my mom used to chase me around the house screaming \"you're not stressed enough\" because she has MASSIVE anxiety she refuses to treat and wanted me to be the same. i learned years later that i don't have most classic anxiety symptoms and probably my mother just conditioned me to have certain symptoms that therapists picked up on and eventually the stress got to me. i'd protect the kid before they have to have certain habits unlearned as an adult.", "Usually food sensitivity cant really be explained. I have a strong reaction to fish, peanut butter and the colour orange. I cant explain it but it makes me physically sick. As in I want to hurl (and have done in the past).", "I'm reading the full post, my friend. None of that changes my point is that he's not being respected.\n\nThis is becoming more of a power struggle, fighting over being right, than an actual attempt to make sure that OP's son is getting adequate nutrition. OP, you, and the person I was originally responding to are all looking at this from the same controlling perspective.", "You still know that you don't want to eat a food because it makes you feel sick.\n\nThe same way i have always known that if a food has even a normal amount of pepper, it hurts my mouth, thus making it hard to eat it.\n\nNot having any reason is most likely just a kid wanting to be annoying and test their parents. The son is old enough to know if something makes him feel sick or hurts aka food sensitivity. \n\nIn this case judging by the reply from op and the fact that his son knows he can get the foods he wants at his moms place point much more towards him trying to control his dad to also give him pizza and nuggies.", "No you don\u2019t understand. I smell peanut butter and look at it and want to be sick. If I actually eat it - its fine. Like I dont have some sort of food sensitivity. Its a sensory issue. The smell of fish and peanut butter make me feel sooooooo sick that I dont even want to attempt it. As an adult I can now explain what happens in my body but at 11yo if I tried to explain to my parents that its an issue they wouldn\u2019t believe me. Back then I wouls also have said \u201cI dont know\u201d. I dont know especially in kids is their way of saying they dont have the words or there is no logic to it.\n\nI eat peanuts fine. I literally cant explain why the moment you open up a peanut butter jar around me I want to hurl. \n\nIts soooo different to my actual food sensitivity like diary that gives me bad reflux and flares up my GORD. \n\nThe one is pure sensory -> physical and the other is physical alone."]}
