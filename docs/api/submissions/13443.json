Some people want a partner who is completely open and has no boundaries. That's also an okay thing to want.

I recommend that you reconsider this relationship in the light of glaring red flags.", "Exactly! Whenever I\u2019m missing something, I check and double-check, and sometimes even triple-check, through all my stuff, and then I ask whoever\u2019s around if they\u2019ve seen it lately. I wouldn\u2019t even think of automatically jumping to digging around in someone else\u2019s stuff, even if I think they took it!

Because OP\u2019s BF clearly doesn\u2019t believe in privacy, boundaries, or respect.", "It sounds like you also have very different ideas on privacy and boundaries. Time for you to decide if this says okay with you because if it's not he's not going to change.", "Reminds me of my ex.  He absolutely refused.  Even when I said \"go get it out of my purse...\"  He was always all \"nuh uh!!!!\" And then he'd bring it to me.  Too funny.  Quite adorable really, relative to idiot boyfriend in the OP.", "He told me that he doesn\u2019t want to be with someone who isn\u2019t open and left.

That\u2019s some bold shit he did and stood on it.", "Yup, he left but I feel like this is where we part ways", "Yup, mines doesn\u2019t like me having phone conversations in his presence which is fucking odd but whatever it\u2019s over now", "There was no secret, I told him it wasn\u2019t in there and he insisted I was hiding something and proceeded to go through my drawer. After I told him it wasn\u2019t in there which it wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t feel like I should have to tell an adult something more than once. Further more the situation would have been different had he asked me to look for it or asked if he could look in my drawer for it.", "Yes", "Get out while you can. Because he is only going to get more controlling. I mean he physically moved you out of the way so that he could go through your things. That is not normal behavior. That is a huge flashing warning sign that he is controlling.", "I\u2019ve been with someone like that i know how you feel, they make you feel bad for not doing something you\u2019re uncomfortable doing. in the moment i would always feel bad and think maybe he\u2019s right, but looking back i was shocked he even tried it and stood on it, like u said", "NTA. They always say shit like that. My ex even tried to control who I talked to on the phone, when he wasn't present. Like I wasn't allowed to answer unless he was there to monitor the conversation. If I didn't agree to that then \"I obviously had something to hide.\" No, I just want some fucking privacy. That's why he's an ex.", "Then I would say yes you are the AH here. It's his house too. What are you hiding from him? There really isn't an expectation of privacy when you live together.", "Lmao no, OP is NTA. Living together doesn\u2019t make you entitled to go through someone's things, SO or not. It's basic privacy. \n\nUnless OP and her boyfriend share the drawer, he has no right going through OP's stuff. If they have their own seperate drawers and he is going through OP's then he is TA", "Of course there is an expectation of privacy when you live together. I've been married for 20 years and my husband does not go through my things, and I don't go through his. I journal everyday, he has never once tried to read it even when I leave it in the living room. It has never been an issue, because we already trusted each other before moving in together and then getting married. \n\nIt does not matter if you are living with your SO or not, EVERYONE has an expectation of privacy when it comes to their things.", "Totally wrong. Lived with my husband for over 20 years and never once has he gone through my things or invaded my privacy. If he is looking for something, then he asks me to look through my stuff!", "I don\u2019t agree with this. Just because you live with your significant other doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t deserving of privacy or of being private. It doesn\u2019t mean something is being hidden. People can be particular about their things and their space and others (regardless of who they are) should respect the boundaries placed.", "Living together doesn\u2019t mean you merge everything and lose privacy and the right to set boundaries completely.", "that's not true at all.", "There absolutely is an expectation of privacy when you live together. He shouldn't be looking in a drawer designated \"hers\", or her diary, or phone, or mail. \n\nSheesh. No privacy? Taking a shit sure becomes problematic...", "Why does having boundaries mean OP must be hiding something? She's allowed privacy. Would you be comfortable with a roommate or a family member going through your things? What if you live in an old person's home--can the other residents there go through your things? No, absolutely not! Being close or living with someone doesn't negate a person's control over themselves and their belongings.", "Glad to hear it's over. I had an ex who thought \"what's yours is mine and what's mine is off limits\", and things got worse from there. Be safe, move on, make sure all your locks are updated so no extra keys can be used.
