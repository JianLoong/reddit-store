My brother-in-law had a 3 hour conversation with her before they both came to our house to speak with us, and there was a major difference in her behavior, right off the bat. Not only did she apologize to me and my husband for what happened, but she apologized for everything that she had done within the few years I have known her. We made a group decision to go low contact with her for a little while, and got back into contact with her shortly after we had our second child, and things have been fairly decent since then.\n\nHowever, that is not to say that everything has been great. My husband and I have been making decisions about our lives moving forward when we move into our own place this coming spring. There will be very minimum contact between my husband and his family, which we know will be beneficial for us, our family, our mental healths, etc. It is a lot that I frankly shouldn\u2019t get into, so I can leave it at that.\n\nI want to thank everyone for their advice, some genuine and some not so genuine. I know this probably wasn\u2019t the update wanted, but it is what I have to give. Thank you all for listening!", "created_utc": 1701482823, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/188syaq/update_aita_for_telling_my_sil_to_stop_using_my/", "score": 100, "replies": ["Original post was deleted by accident! Here is the OG story:\n\nWhile pregnant with my 2nd child, my SIL (BIL\u2019s girlfriend) was treating my children like they were her children. Example: would say things like \u201cauntie\u2019s babies\u201d, would want photos of ultrasounds or my pregnant belly to send to her friends/teachers/etc. One day, she had come over, and even though my daughter wanted to stay in her nana\u2019s bedroom, my SIL pulled her out of the room. This resulted in my daughter freaking out, going into a breathing spell (holding her breath for a long time), and not letting out a cry. SIL blew in her face multiple times, refused to bring her to me, and got mad that my daughter didn\u2019t want her. Ended up in an argument where I told her to stop acting like she knows everything and that she is their mother, and they aren\u2019t her \u201csurrogate babies\u201d. This resulted in BIL and SIL being upset with me, and not speaking to me for a long time.", "Hun you forgot the original post.\n\nEdit: i think your original was deleted.", "\nIt looks like you're trying to post an update to your AITA post.\n\n#Read our update guidelines [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_can_i_post_an_update_on_my_thread.3F)\n\nIf your post meets the outlined guidelines, please [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/amitheasshole&subject=Update+Request) for approval.
