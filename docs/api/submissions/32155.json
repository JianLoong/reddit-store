My brother-in-law had a 3 hour conversation with her before they both came to our house to speak with us, and there was a major difference in her behavior, right off the bat. Not only did she apologize to me and my husband for what happened, but she apologized for everything that she had done within the few years I have known her. We made a group decision to go low contact with her for a little while, and got back into contact with her shortly after we had our second child, and things have been fairly decent since then.\n\nHowever, that is not to say that everything has been great. My husband and I have been making decisions about our lives moving forward when we move into our own place this coming spring. There will be very minimum contact between my husband and his family, which we know will be beneficial for us, our family, our mental healths, etc. It is a lot that I frankly shouldn\u2019t get into, so I can leave it at that.\n\nI want to thank everyone for their advice, some genuine and some not so genuine. I know this probably wasn\u2019t the update wanted, but it is what I have to give.

Here is the OG story:\n\nWhile pregnant with my 2nd child, my SIL (BIL\u2019s girlfriend) was treating my children like they were her children. Example: would say things like \u201cauntie\u2019s babies\u201d, would want photos of ultrasounds or my pregnant belly to send to her friends/teachers/etc. One day, she had come over, and even though my daughter wanted to stay in her nana\u2019s bedroom, my SIL pulled her out of the room. This resulted in my daughter freaking out, going into a breathing spell (holding her breath for a long time), and not letting out a cry. SIL blew in her face multiple times, refused to bring her to me, and got mad that my daughter didn\u2019t want her. Ended up in an argument where I told her to stop acting like she knows everything and that she is their mother, and they aren\u2019t her \u201csurrogate babies\u201d. This resulted in BIL and SIL being upset with me, and not speaking to me for a long time.", "Hun you forgot the original post.\n\nEdit: i think your original was deleted.", "\nIt looks like you're trying to post an update to your AITA post.\n\n#Read our update guidelines [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_can_i_post_an_update_on_my_thread.3F)\n\nIf your post meets the outlined guidelines, please [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/amitheasshole&subject=Update+Request) for approval.

I\u2019ll try to post the gist of it in the comments!", "Well done you and that's a lot of red flags she showing", "INFO\n\nGiven that his family took you in, helped you both  build money back up,  helped raised your kid, which was (in your words) an 'amazing offer', if things are so bad that you need to go low contact, why dont you move out now?  Why wait until spring?", "INFO: would you offer this same advice to a woman saving up money in secret so that she can safely leave her abusive husband?", "Yeah. The grandmother was on their side too?\n\nI guess maybe the fallout of potentially the rest of the family being against OP and her husband was enough to damage the relationship to need LC? Unfortunate if so. I hope the grandmother and OP are still on good terms. And glad BIL\u2019s gf has wisened up.", "Want to save more money to tbe detriment of her inlaws", "Different scenario, but yes.  Waiting until you can leave safely can be too late.", "People don't get to treat you worse because they're helping you, and actions still have consequences regardless of the situation. If the only reason you offer help to someone else is to shoehorn yourself into their parenting decisions, you're a bad person.", "Don't worry did you catch the age of everyone in the original? These people are all children themselves having and raising children. Their kids will go lc/NC too when the time comes.", "[deleted]", "I just want to comment on the \u201caunties babies\u201d. Seriously, you overreacted here. Feeling love as an aunt towards her boyfriend\u2019s nephews/nieces and calling them \u201cAUNTIE\u2019S babies\u201d does not in any way imply that she thinks they are hers.", "The og post is saved in the comments: https://www.reddit.com/j9w2ylw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2", "If the SIL is like this over a kid that's not hers, what is she going to be like if she has a child of her own?", "Financial situation was made better because we left our old home, imo. We were putting more money into a home than what we had (bit off more than we could chew), so moving into his gm\u2019s house was better for us. Having another kid really didn\u2019t put any dent into what was going on financially. Especially because oldest is out of diapers, doesn\u2019t need formula, etc.", "Grandmother has been on our side the whole time. There has been a lot in between that incident and now that has happened as well, which is why we made the decision to go lc, if not nc, when we leave with everyone, except gm.", "This is totally not the same thing as not being able to afford to live on your own. Leaving a DV situation can cause a death so the idea of them not leaving because they have no money is in no way comparable. I work with DV survivors and we sometimes safety plan for months before finding a good way to leave. This story does not even begin to ride to the threat level of a DV situation.", "The idea of going no contact was actually my husband\u2019s idea, not mine.", "Did you read the automod copy? Because \u201cauntie\u2019s babies\u201d is the least of it, it was just part of setting the scene.", "I\u2019m not OP.", "She did a lot of growing up, especially after her own sister unexpectedly had a kid. Back then, she didn\u2019t realize what actually comes with having a kid, because she didn\u2019t have hands on experience with babies. She just wanted kids because she was having bad \u201cbaby fever\u201d, which got taken to the extreme.", "[removed]", "Not waiting until you can leave safely is so incredibly risky.  Also, what's the point if leaving one risky one for another?  Not being able to leave safely may leave the victim (and possibly other living beings) houseless.  Shelters get full, places run out of space for people.  A domestic abuse survivor may be safer, physically, staying with the abuser for two more months than living on the streets.  If the survivor was a stay at home for an extended period of time that plus being houseless makes it nearly impossible to get a job if the area doesn't have remotely decent resources for survivors.  \n\n\n\n\nSome abusers heavily escalate when the survivor leaves/tries to leave.  A non-physically violent abuser frequently turns physically abusive in those situations if given the chance.  A survivor can't always take their must have essentials of they are making an unsafe leave.  This runs the high risk of those things being destroyed.  If the survivor is houseless and has no way out of their area than this increases the risk of the abuser tracking them down and becoming violent, if not murdering them.  If you managed to leave a domestic abuse situation unsafely and went easily & turned out well, I am incredibly happy for you but know that is not the norm.  If you've never even been in a domestic abuse situation please choose your advice carefully, especially if you do not know the intimate details of the victim's situation.\n\n\n\nWhile my ex-husband raped me frequently he never beat me.  While he came close a few times he never did because he knew physical abuse like what my aunt went through was not something I would stay through.  When I was leaving (which ultimately took me 2 years to be able to leave safely).  I had to tell him I wasn't coming back in a mutual friend's house because they had video surveillance as had I done it any other way he would have turned physically violent towards me.  There would have been no way for me to sneak my stuff out and a police escort was out of the question as they refused to help any time I reached out to them about ex-husband's abuse.  If my cat hadn't been able to be removed while I was telling him elsewhere things would not have ended well for my kitty.  He threw out a number of my things that were important, some completely irreplaceable and some I am still trying to replace, in the 10 hours before I was able to retrieve my stuff.  I stayed in the place where I told him that night, as it was my last night pet sitting for said mutual friend, but it would not have been possible for kitty rescuerer to have grabbed all of the other stuff I needed. \n\n\n\nIn some situations yes, you do take the risk to leave before it's safe.  But there are very legitimate and severe reasons it is heavily stressed that victims wait until it is safe to leave.", "That\u2019s the funny part: his mother does exactly that. What\u2019s even funnier: she treats us like trash and uses us as her personal Uber, maid, etc. all while not paying for anything (even her own stuff), and not even living in her own house. Everything is his grandmother\u2019s. It\u2019s ironic that people are getting mad that we would cut her off, but if I was to reveal everything she has done to us or even her own mother, all while contributing nothing, people\u2019s opinions would flip automatically.", "If you accept generous help from someone and then cut them off as soon as you don't need them anymore, you're a bad person.\n\nEdit - to the person who replied and then blocked me. There was no mention of abuse when i commented. \n\nHope that helps!", "Did YOU read that I specifically and *only* made a comment about *ONE* of her exemples and *NOT* the entire situation?", "That's one helluva case of baby fever is all I'm saying", "It is not- because no one should be comparing the two situations. You don\u2019t have to name call when called out for a ridiculous comparison.", "This comment explains my mindset perfectly. My husband and I have ultimately just kept the peace, keep secrets from them about money, and are keeping quiet about moving out until we have a place set in stone, and then we will announce we are leaving. Especially because we have children involved, we are wanting to do this safely.\n\nI am so sorry for what you had to go through. I hope the place you are now (mentally and physically) is a thousand times better \u2764\ufe0f", "Blew my mind also how young these people are. \"SIL has no children of her own\" of course she doesn't, she's 18 lol", "I\u2019m in my early 20\u2019s having children. There are girls still 15/16 having children. And I\u2019m being called the child for having children as an adult?", "We didn\u2019t accept help from his mother. We accepted help from his grandmother. Grandmother is not the problem, mother is. Like I said in previous comment, if I revealed everything she has ever done to us, just in the past year, a lot of opinions would change, and everyone would be saying it\u2019s good that we are going to go lc/nc.", "Helping someone doesn't give you a right to abuse them. \n\nHope this helps!", "But her reaction is to the entire thing. How on earth do you claim to measure how much she reacted to that?\n\nYou can\u2019t, so you seem to be reacting to it being included at all.\n\nWhich is why I pointed out that it\u2019s part of setting the scene.", "She went CRAZY after she found out I was having my first kid. She always thought she was pregnant, always talked to my BIL about having kids, even convinced him for a split second that they needed one. She did the same when I was pregnant with my second. It was an insane period in time", "Ignore them. They're gaslighting you. Its clear to everyone they were being rude and you were being reasonable.", "[removed]", "My SIL back then was trying to actively trick my BIL into having children. Like many stated in comments on my original post, she was probably feeling left out because we had our first at 20 and 21. However, with all that in mind, our decisions of when we had children shouldn\u2019t force her into thinking she HAS to have kids. If she\u2019s going to be influenced that hard (I.e: \u201cbaby fever\u201d) that she HAS to have kids, we are not at fault for that.", "Yes, unless you and your partner can take care of your children without your parents then yes. Stop having kids.", "I can and I did. \nShe can be right and have valid reasons for most of her arguments and still be overeating to some of it. Right and wrong can go together. \nBeing right on a few things does not automatically make the person right on everything.  My opinion stands, the part about the lady calling her children auntie\u2019s babies is not a big deal.", "I feel a bit bad because it must have a very difficult, emotionally fraught time for which I don't envy you one little bit\n\nBut it was also highly entertaining to read", "This is gaslighting. It's an ugly trait. \n\nYou offered a shit comparison, and they pointed it out, and then you got rude, then you pretended you weren't being rude when we can all see it. \n\nSort yourself out.", "LOL- so is an inability to understand context and critical thinking. Calling someone a name that is not theirs is indeed an an insult when used in the context of text you used it in. I hope you do some research on DV and the impacts of fleeing so you never make such a stupid comment on something like this again. Dying by being a person beaten by a partner is rarely funny and certainly not the same as this situation, so if you find yourself comparing the two- please pick up a book.", "We don\u2019t. I stay home with them while husband works nights. Nobody else watches them, unless it is an emergency. They are very well taken care of.", "You must be fun at parties.\n\nDude if you\u2019re going to comment then start reading the whole thing lol. Just admit you were wrong, it\u2019s not a big deal?? You\u2019re aggressive for no reason lol", "In addition to everything else, it IS a big deal. You\u2019re missing the big picture here.", "I fully agree. It\u2019s massively funny to me now, in the sense of \u201cwhy in gods name did you act like that\u201d, you know? \ud83d\ude02", "That's nice I hope you don't get any government benefits either. Those kids are still at a defecit and it's selfish, borderline abusive that you had them so young but at least you are taking responsibility.", "Actually I am because I don\u2019t make a big deal out of things and don\u2019t turn things into drama. :) \nAggressive for sharing my opinion? Ha. \nWhy would I if I don\u2019t think I am wrong? Byee!", "I appreciate your concern. However, as both my kids are in their correct percentile for height and weight, are both developmentally ahead, are clean, have routines for their days, and are overall happy\u2026 I think I\u2019m doing just fine. You can have your opinions, and some I may not agree with, but I will say this: my age has nothing to do with the responsibility of taking care of my children. I knew what I was getting into when I got pregnant, but that doesn\u2019t mean I will fail. I determine to give my children better than what I had growing up. Without any argument further, I think we can both agree that as long as a child is happy, well fed, clean, and well loved, something is being done right. :)", "It\u2019s always the people who think they\u2019re a pleasant and fun person to be around who are just fucking insufferable.", "Good luck unless you are actively have been and in therapy you are just going to repeat all those mistakes onto your kids. Someone who is proud to have kids that young obviously has deep seated trauma."]}
