Everyone is expecting OP to be rational like an adult.  The people ho should be concerned is the friends parents.  They should\u2019ve secured transportation for this child while they were gone with other PARENTS not expect you child\u2019s friends to cart her around without speaking to the parents first.  When the younger sister said it fine that the friend rides home with her the parents should\u2019ve contacted OP\u2019s parents.  Since both the younger sister and the friend obviously doesn\u2019t drive yet since she rides with the older siblings.  This is a failing for the friends parents.  It\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility to take this child home.  OP also mentioned that the legal requirement is only immediate family is to be passengers in the car.  This is also telling because that makes them all about 17 under. In my state teens can only have one other teen in the car with them regardless if they are family or not unless theirs a licensed adult in the car too.  This law was put into place to curb teen accidents.  More teens in the car with an inexperienced driver tends to lead to distraction.\n\nEveryone complaining that OP left a child stranded needs to remember everyone in this situation is a child and there are laws to be followed.  Older sister was trying to be helpful, when she herself shouldn\u2019t have been carting the friend around either.  OP isn\u2019t an AH they\u2019re following the law.  If they get caught with more teens in the car then is allowed they can lose their driving privileges until they\u2019re 21.  So as a parent I didn\u2019t allow my kid to drive anyone without my permission.  If something was wrong with her car, I brought her to school and picked up her friend who rode with her.  They wold sty at my home doing homework then I would bring her home or her parents would pick her up.  That\u2019s how being a parent works you don\u2019t drop your duties on your kids friends.", "ESH.  Her parents should not have left her without preparing.  While what they did was wrong, you should be more concerned about the friend's safety.  I would have said I will it do it this once and then have a discussion with your sister when you get home out of earshot of her friend.  Then you run through a list of why it is unacceptable and ask her if she promised her friend a ride to and from school.  If your sister did that, then this is on her.  You tell her she is not allowed to offer anyone transportation again without checking with the person driving her as they may have other plans or appointments or it may not be allowed legally.  It's just a freaking ride to and from school from a place you pass anyways.  Getting bent out of shape over her voluntelling you is fine.  Getting this bent out of shape for giving a person she knows a ride during a time of difficulty for her, is ridiculous.", "YTA \n\nYou literally stated in your post it would only take a couple minutes. You abandoned her at school with no way of getting home. It was just on the way and you are being ridiculous. You are in the comments trying to say a 17 year old is grown enough to ask you first but you are back talking just like a 17 year old as well lmao. From your comments you came here for validation not judgement. No this is petty just because you feel a certain way doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do something nice and you leave a kid trapped at school to spend a long while walking home or waiting for an adult.\n\nEdit to add: I have had these situations pop up in my life being the deignated driver for example or when picking my own sister up for school. Never have I been butt hurt about it because like a decent human being I hope everyone gets home safe and I would rather take the extra 10 minutes to make that happen than throw a fit and have something happen in the rare chance it does.", "[deleted]", "Thank you I feel this way too. I feel like an ass but at the same time I feel like it's not my responsibility to look after her friend even if others think it's the right thing to do. I picked her up anyways and we're gonna have a discussion going forward on this.", "if it was mutally agreed upon that my sister got a ride by someone at a specific time, yes I'd be very upset if that person didn't go through with it.\n\nMy problem is, her friends parents don't communicate and kind of just expect us to pick her daughter up from school and take her there whenever her parents aren't available, which I would be okay with if her parents communicated with us first and if they offered to help with bringing my sister to places as well (which they dont). I don't mind doing it as an off thing but to constantly be on standby for sisters friend isn't my responsibility and I Feel like an Uber at times.", "She did do exactly what ur saying", "Yes.  She's a dependent and still in high school. She was dependent on you for a ride.  An adult would have been glad to help.  You decided to throw a little fit and abandon a child.

Sure, your sister could have asked you first but it would have only taken a few extra minutes to drop her friend off. You need to learn some flexibility, especially when it isn\u2019t really all that inconvenient to be flexible and help someone. You stranded a child (and yes, she\u2019s a child) because you were feeling petty and couldn\u2019t be bothered to do a small act of kindness you weren\u2019t expecting to have to do. When you grow up, you\u2019ll learn that unexpected things happen and flexibility will be required, and if you keep the attitude you have now - refusing to do even the smallest thing for someone else unless you\u2019re asked a while in advance (because nothing is your problem and why bother helping people when they need it at the last minute right, even when it\u2019s not even inconvenient to do so /s) - no one will do anything nice for you in emergency/urgent situations.", "YTA. \n\nThis happened to me where I was the younger sister. My dad agreed to pick up me and my best friend who lived down the street from the movies one night. I got in the car with FOUR other friends and he was LIVID. He completely embarrassed me in front of them by telling me off, and after dropping them all off, clarified to my best friend that he definitely wasn\u2019t mad at her because he knew ahead of time he was responsible for driving her. The subtext being that he was mad at me lol. But he dropped off all four girls, none of whom were on the way. Because I was the one who told them he would. And they were kids who needed a ride. \n\nYou can tell off your sister, tell her you\u2019re not doing it again (but this kids on the way so I don\u2019t really get the issue of doing it if she asks ahead of time), or whatever else you want to do because that IS super annoying. The assumption here instead of asking seems to be what\u2019s getting you and is definitely what pissed my dad off.

Stop trying to defend yourself, you are literally admitting to pulling an asshole move here. It doesn't matter if the girl wasn't your legal responsibility, you still ditched her and left her to fend for herself because you and your sister are petty assholes to each other.\n\nDo you know of something called \"compassion\"? That's what you lack, compassion. It was ON THE WAY to your home and you are acting like it was in a completely different state. You abandoned a minor, aka, exposing her to danger, because you think your sister is bossy. Just take the L already...", "Sisters friend can get an Uber or she can wait at the school until her parents decide to show up and be a parent.\n\nI agree it's asshole to not pick her up, but I find it funny the comments think I'm responsible for someone else when there's no obligation. In that case, I'm automatically responsible for every minor I know that doesn't have a ride at school and refuse to give a ride home?", "That you're a bag of dicks. \nEnglish is my second language and I got it, it wasn't really *that* hard.", "It\u2019s the \u201cpolite\u201d way of saying bag full of d*cks so that you don\u2019t get in trouble for cursing.

You need therapy for your anger issues!", "Jesus get over yourself. You\u2019re too old to be proud of being this pathetic.", "Well-  can\u2019t say you even tried to be anything other than YTA.  Why did you come here? To brag? Eep!", "So, not only are YTA, you\u2019re endangering other people with your angsty BS. \n\nGet some therapy.", "OP. I took a quick look at some previous posts of yours and I assume you're about maybe 23? Maybe a little younger? Which I find hard to believe. To me it sounds like you're a whole lot younger, like 17, 18 with the immaturity that comes wit the age. But the way you express yourself sounds a whole lot younger, like a teenager. I get the way your sister is, bugs you because she's demanding and stuff, and that would bother anyone, the continuous messaging for five minutes late and such. Maybe have a talk with the parents, let them know little sis needs to be at least polite if she wants to be picked up and taken to school because since you're not their parent, is not actually your obligation. The way you are defending yourself when you could have included you did take the other kid home, in the original post and reformulated the question, it makes you sound like a teenager, like younger than 17. I get it, siblings can be a pain, I was too, and being parentified can be a pain too, but your post is not ideally phrased. You took the kid home, why ask if yta for \"not taking her home\"? You're asking if you're ta for not doing something... You did do. Ask if you're ta for not wanting to do that anymore, for planning on not doing it, on being angry at your sister and threatening not to take the friend.\n\nHonestly, talk to your parents or guardians, tell them little sis needs to learn to be patient and at least a little considerate since you can do her the favor but she should at least learn to ask. She's a teenager, she should have learned to ask. Of course teens are a lot like toddlers in the way that they forget the basic things they were taught in manners but that's a thing for the parents or guardians of the home to address. Talk to them, have them have a talk with her. Lay off the defensiveness that makes you seem like younger than 15. You came to reddit, provided some info and asked for a judgement based on the info you provided, you know how it works, you can't act like a kid because you didn't phrase things accordingly", "Lmao when you inevitably delete this post like the last one it'll be funny to see it on those podcasts", "What in the actual fuck is wrong with you. \n Honestly.", "Jesus Christ doing brake checks is dangerous and stupid.", "I miss the old reddit.", "When they have no other way home and it wouldn't be a serious inconvenience for you then yes, you have an obligation.\n\n\nA MORAL obligation.", "Why'd you even bother posting here if you already knew you were the AH in this scenario? \ud83d\ude44 Your responses up till now show a big immaturity on your part too for how you handled this, it's so hard to feel empathetic on your part (especially since you left out crucial info on the actual post!)"]}
