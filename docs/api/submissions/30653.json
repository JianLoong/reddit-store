I cannot imagine leaving someone stranded, even if it was out of my way. What happened to kindness and decency. This was a very selfish way to behave", "YTA.  Jesus, you abandoned a child with no ride to punish your sister for not asking first. If you had any empathy or maturity you would have taken the extra 5 minutes, then had a discussion with your sister, after her friend, who had nothing to do with your petty sibling issues, was safely home.\n\nYou don't mention your age or gender but I'm guessing you're the oldest brother. I'm also guessing you're 18.  Seems like you've forgotten how it feels to be dependent on others for transportation.  \n\nIf you have an issue with your sister's attitude or expression,  don't use innocent bystanders to flex your big bro muscles. And remember, that age difference that you seem to think puts you so far above your sister will be meaningless in ten years.  You may need her help. Will she feel compassion, or will she seek payback!", "ESH: Yes she should have asked, but you literally admit it's on the way. Instead, you left a CHILD stranded at the school with no way home. You at the very least should have made sure she was able to get another ride.", "YTA\n\nYour sister saw that she would be stranded and/or forced to walk and she thought since she got approval from one \"adult\" that it was a go. She wasn't talking advantage of you, she was expecting that both her older sisters would communicate with each other and that the \"yes\" she received was from both of you.\n\nI hope this is something you posted before school let out and you didn't leave that poor baby stranded at school. If you really have to ask if leaving a kid stranded is an AH move, then you don't realize how big of one you are...", "YTA You agreed to take over for your older sister. Your older sister already agreed to give the friend a ride. It\u2019s not even out of your way. This is such a non-event that you\u2019ve turned into a problem. \n\nYou said you weren\u2019t asked, but you were asked and then you agreed to take over carpooling for your older sister. That means to do what your older sister said she would do. Which included dropping the friend off. \n\nTbh this sounds more like a sibling rivalry issue. You\u2019re just making life more difficult for yourself if this is how you\u2019re going to deal with things.", "Would you be ok if someone left your sister stranded somewhere with no way to go home?\n\nYTA.

They probably assumed your sister had cleared it with you first.", "YTA for leaving a child stranded.

Everyone is expecting OP to be rational like an adult.  The people ho should be concerned is the friends parents.  They should\u2019ve secured transportation for this child while they were gone with other PARENTS not expect you child\u2019s friends to cart her around without speaking to the parents first.  When the younger sister said it fine that the friend rides home with her the parents should\u2019ve contacted OP\u2019s parents.  Since both the younger sister and the friend obviously doesn\u2019t drive yet since she rides with the older siblings.  This is a failing for the friends parents.  It\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility to take this child home.  OP also mentioned that the legal requirement is only immediate family is to be passengers in the car.  This is also telling because that makes them all about 17 under. In my state teens can only have one other teen in the car with them regardless if they are family or not unless theirs a licensed adult in the car too.  This law was put into place to curb teen accidents.  More teens in the car with an inexperienced driver tends to lead to distraction.\n\nEveryone complaining that OP left a child stranded needs to remember everyone in this situation is a child and there are laws to be followed.  Older sister was trying to be helpful, when she herself shouldn\u2019t have been carting the friend around either.  OP isn\u2019t an AH they\u2019re following the law.  If they get caught with more teens in the car then is allowed they can lose their driving privileges until they\u2019re 21.  So as a parent I didn\u2019t allow my kid to drive anyone without my permission.  If something was wrong with her car, I brought her to school and picked up her friend who rode with her.  They wold sty at my home doing homework then I would bring her home or her parents would pick her up.  That\u2019s how being a parent works you don\u2019t drop your duties on your kids friends.", "ESH.  Her parents should not have left her without preparing.  While what they did was wrong, you should be more concerned about the friend's safety.  I would have said I will it do it this once and then have a discussion with your sister when you get home out of earshot of her friend.  Then you run through a list of why it is unacceptable and ask her if she promised her friend a ride to and from school.  If your sister did that, then this is on her.  You tell her she is not allowed to offer anyone transportation again without checking with the person driving her as they may have other plans or appointments or it may not be allowed legally.  It's just a freaking ride to and from school from a place you pass anyways.  Getting bent out of shape over her voluntelling you is fine.  Getting this bent out of shape for giving a person she knows a ride during a time of difficulty for her, is ridiculous.", "YTA \n\nYou literally stated in your post it would only take a couple minutes. You abandoned her at school with no way of getting home. It was just on the way and you are being ridiculous. You are in the comments trying to say a 17 year old is grown enough to ask you first but you are back talking just like a 17 year old as well lmao. From your comments you came here for validation not judgement. No this is petty just because you feel a certain way doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do something nice and you leave a kid trapped at school to spend a long while walking home or waiting for an adult.\n\nEdit to add: I have had these situations pop up in my life being the deignated driver for example or when picking my own sister up for school. Never have I been butt hurt about it because like a decent human being I hope everyone gets home safe and I would rather take the extra 10 minutes to make that happen than throw a fit and have something happen in the rare chance it does.", "Do you consider 17 year old to be a child?", "Thank you I feel this way too. I feel like an ass but at the same time I feel like it's not my responsibility to look after her friend even if others think it's the right thing to do. I picked her up anyways and we're gonna have a discussion going forward on this.", "if it was mutally agreed upon that my sister got a ride by someone at a specific time, yes I'd be very upset if that person didn't go through with it.\n\nMy problem is, her friends parents don't communicate and kind of just expect us to pick her daughter up from school and take her there whenever her parents aren't available, which I would be okay with if her parents communicated with us first and if they offered to help with bringing my sister to places as well (which they dont). I don't mind doing it as an off thing but to constantly be on standby for sisters friend isn't my responsibility and I Feel like an Uber at times.", "She did do exactly what ur saying", "Yes.  She's a dependent and still in high school. She was dependent on you for a ride.  An adult would have been glad to help.  You decided to throw a little fit and abandon a child.  I'm surprised you didn't throw yourself on the ground, kicking, and screaming, \"I don't WANT to drive her home!\"\n\nAnd as it's obvious that you are older and still a child, I'm surprised that you expect someone younger than you to be more adult than you are.  Good lord, grow up!", "YES", ">ster didn't ask me if it was okay to drive her friend home and kind of just expected I would.  \n>  \n>I tell her I'm not interested in taking her friend home, you didn't ask an assumed I would take her regardless, and I don't feel like I should take extra time out to take her friend home, it's not my responsibility, but my youngest sister insists that \"it's just on the way\" and I'm being ridiculous.  \n>  \n>My youngest sister tends to be a bit bossy when she demands things too, like she will tell me where to park and get upset if I'm not driving at the speed limit because she wants to get home faster.

I get you i do, but this is a child we're talking about.\n\nThats how kids end up dead or go missing. They get left stranded to find their won way home, and little girls and boys, sometimes never make it home. You read newspapers? Watch tv?", "You're right. That girl being alone sucks, but that's not on you. She's the responsibility of her parents & her family. Does she have any family who could look after her?", "You make a lot of assumptions with so little information. You're also just straight attacking me and making up scenarios that didn't happen. Regardless, I did end up bringing her friend home and I'm going to discuss this with her going forward.", "I can understand if we're talking about someone not in highschool. My sisters friend is 17 year old with a job .According to her, her parents went to a concert and told her to find her own way to school.", "I like that u said this...NTA", "considering you were already driving, and it is close, you are a massive AH no matter how you try to spin it. Go apologize to your sister and her friend.", ">a job .According to her, her parents went to a conce\n\nShe is a minor, you are not. If something happens to her it's on you.  It IS your responsibility if you knowingly leave a minor stranded knowing they don't have a ride home.  As an adult, you do have a responsibility to protect kids.", "They\u2019re definitely right about you being a jerk to a kid, but they aren\u2019t factoring in that you\u2019re also clearly a kid.", ">She is a minor, you are not. If something happens to her it's on you. It IS your responsibility if you knowingly leave a minor stranded knowing they don't have a ride home.\n\nWhy is it my responsibility? She's not part of my family, and her family obviously didn't care to get her a ride themself. Why does the responsibility fall on me? You can consider that to be an asshole move, but it's weird to say I'd be responsible if anything happened to my sister's friend when I have 0 obligation.", "Because sometimes people do things for each other even if it was unannounced or unasked for, she lives right to your house, it didn't cost you ANYTHING to dropped her off, instead you are here on reddit arguing like an idiot because you were \"force\" to help A CHILD, get your selfish head out of your ass, hope you never need anything from anyone.", "Sometimes that\u2019s just life man. You\u2019re in a position where you can help a child who is stranded; if you don\u2019t want that responsibility, don\u2019t take it, but the majority of adults recognize that sometimes you\u2019re given responsibilities you never asked for, and will think YTA for ignoring them", "Exactly what happened to calling an uber/shuttle \n\nSeriously NTA"]}
