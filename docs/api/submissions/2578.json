Tell her, \"I am not a farmer and I don't have eggs to sell or give away.\" \n\nJeez! That's not something you just give away because someone wants them. She asked, you said no, end of story.", "NTA.  But PLEASE get a 2nd AND 3rd opinion before the surgery. Please. Doctors are not gods. They are not perfect. Be your own advocate and become wildly informed.", "that's so bizarre of your aunt wtf. also as someone who found out her eggs were fucked at 16 im really sorry you're going through it.  NTA at all btw", "Don\u2019t give your own eggs to ANYBODY!! you don\u2019t owe anybody something so close to you.

Let him stick up for you against the family.", "NTA wtf \ud83d\ude31 she is able to find a different solution. She has no right to use your eggs. What if you want your own baby in 10 years? And all eggs are gone? Just because their okay now doesnt mean they stay okay for ever. \nI had a ICSI treatment this week and from 18 eggs were 8 non-useable, 10 were treated and only 1 egg survived.

The second she uttered the \u2018unfit\u2019 bs she proved that she is in fact Not fit to be a mother.

You can't just ask for someone's eggs. Your aunt is insane. It sounds like you have a lovely father though \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. You don't get to insult someone, then ask them for a favor.

I understand that she is frustrated that she can\u2019t have kids, but she isn\u2019t entitle to your eggs. It\u2019s your decision on whether use or not your eggs.", "NTA", "NTA indeed.

It's normal to not like kids or to like them but not be skilled at caretaking. You may never want kids and that's fine, but you have over a decade to decide if it's for you or not.
