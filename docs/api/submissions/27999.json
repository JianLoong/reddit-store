My brother spent a long time convincing her that the baby was God's will. I told him that he needed to consider  how much work was involved in taking care of a baby with so many special needs. My boyfriend is a pediatric nurse. He tells me horror stories. I said his wife was right. He said I was a terrible sister and aunt for saying those things. He got our parents involved and they told me to mind my own business. So the baby went to term. And she was born with deformations and disabilities. \n\nSorry if I do not go further than that. \n\nMy brother was home for two weeks then he went back to work. My sister-in-law was basically responsible for that poor baby girl for the next six months. Plus my five year old nephew. She couldn't take it and she took their son and moved to her parents' house. \n\nMy brother has been trying to get her to come home but she won't. My parents both work so they cannot help as much as they would like. \n\nHe asked me for help and it took everything I had not to say that it was God's will that he take care of his daughter since he wanted her to be born so badly. \n\nInstead I just said that I couldn't because I couldn't watch her and go to school. He said that the help he was getting from the government and family was not enough and that he was going to lose his job. I apologized but I said I could not sacrifice my future for his decisions. \n\nHe tried getting my parents to convince me but I told them that I had been informed by them that I should \"stay out of it\". And I was choosing to do so as I had done so previously. \n\nMy mom is having to take time off to help him and it is draining her. \n\nI had lunch with my sister-in-law yesterday and I asked her when she was going home. She said she wasn't sure she could handle that yet. I did not push. \n\nMy family thinks I am being an asshole by putting my studies, which I pay for myself, are more important than my brother's job and marriage. \n\nI don't think I should sacrifice for someone who chose the life he got.", "created_utc": 1696168742, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16x1xku/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_brother_with_my/", "score": 5571, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He browbeat his pregnant wife into keeping a pregnancy she did not want to continue. I know she has some responsibility but he manipulated a woman in a very vulnerable position and that is beyond vile. I feel for her and their son and the baby that he insisted be born. This is beyond tragic and you cannot enable him in thinking his choices were in any way okay or valid", "NTA. You are allowed to choose your own life. People will throw \"family makes sacrifices for each other!\" at you, which is true, but fails to take in the enormity of this particular sacrifice. This isn't missing out on a few Friday nights here and there, this is missing out on the life you're trying to build for yourself. You aren't a replacement wife, and there's a very real possibility that your SIL will never come back. Are you supposed to just put your life on hold indefinitely?", "NTA\n\nYour brother wanted the baby, his wife didn\u2019t. He knew that the baby would need a lot of care and attention, expected his wife to cope somehow and didn\u2019t care that this would also be to the detriment of their older son. I expect he worked long hours, never took over care so his wife could have some \u201cme time\u201d or even just concentrate on their son for a few hours.\n\nNow she has walked out meaning that he is responsible for the baby he wanted to keep and is finding out just how hard it is.\n\nHe built his bed, so he must lie on it.\n\nDon\u2019t neglect your future so that his is easier.", "NTA\n\n When you offered sound advice you were told to stay out of this. So now you're staying out of this\n \n\n>My family thinks I am being an asshole by putting my studies, which I pay for myself, are more important than my brother's job and marriage.\n\n Of course your studies are more important. Duh. It's common sense. \n\nMaybe it's god's will that your brother loses his job.", "NTA. You made your position clear from the start. And, as you said, you were told to stay out of it. As heartbreaking as this is, you should not sacrifice your future for your brother\u2019s sake. And, should you decide to help in the future, staying in school puts you in a better position to help then. \n\nYour parents have decided to help - that was their decision - you are not bound by that. And I can only hope that their feeling are being influenced by their exhaustion.", "NTA, but everyone else sucks.", "NTA. He persuaded his wife to go through with the pregnancy and now he's living with the consequences. It's a shame for the child but he can't expect other people to put their lives on hold for his choices.", "If I were your SIL, I don\u2019t know that I could ever come back. Your brother sounds controlling and manipulative. Yes, this is now a difficult situation and he can\u2019t go it alone, but your SIL did not want to have this baby, was pressured into it, and is now being told she must be the primary caretaker. I mean, no, she did not have to acquiesce to your brother, but I can see how that could feel like an impossible situation. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your brother is regularly a poor partner to her given the info from this story. \n\nI think you\u2019re not in the wrong. You shouldn\u2019t sacrifice for your brother. But if you have some time that isn\u2019t sacrificial and at a cost to you, maybe consider grace.

As is anyone who tells you that you should put your life on hold because of someone else\u2019s bad choices.  \n\nYour SIL made the right choice for her and your nephew.  If she stayed your nephew would be completely sidelined because of the amount of care and attention your niece requires.  Please continue to support her as I am sure she has a lot of guilt about this. \n\nYour brother using God\u2019s will to bully your SIL into continuing the pregnancy has backfired on him.  You should absolutely tell him that it\u2019s God\u2019s will that he be humbled by this experience because of his arrogance. \n\nThe best place for your niece would be in a facility equipped to give her the 24/7 care and support that she needs.", "NTA. You warned your brother that it would be very tough & should terminate the pregnancy. He got on his high horse & insisted. So, now he has to reap the consequences of his decision. Which is in no way your problem.\n\nOut of idle curiosity, could he make his daughter a ward of the state? I know that sounds cold, but he isn't capable of caring for her. She might stand a better chance of getting the care she needs.", "Nta\n\nPeople that use \"god's will\" to get their way *never* feel any accountability or responsibility for their actions and choices. \n\nAll of the adults in this, except for you, are giant ahs.", "NTA. He literally forced this child into the world against all common sense and now wants to force the women in his life to care for her. Good for your sis in law leaving after he forced her to have a ch8ld. I hope she stays away. In fact, tell her to divorce before he loses his job so he gets no alimony.", "NTA. Your brother it\u2019s the real A H. They should had stop the pregnancy. Now it\u2019s too late and euthanasia is non legal, so your brother basically trap him self for life and destroy his own marriage for a religious and stupid believe.", "This is a shitty situation, and something a *lot* of people don't understand about disabled family members.\n\nYou're NTA.", "NTA.\n\n>they told me to mind my own business\n\nDo just that. He can pray or do whatever he thinks will help. This was his choice.", "NTA - she is your brother's responsibility. His situation is his own doing and now he needs to deal with the consequences of his actions.", "NTA and how could anyone possibly think it is your responsibility to take care of someone else\u2019s baby? It is irrelevant that you advised them to terminate. Is there some kind of cultural aspect here because otherwise this just doesn\u2019t make any sense?", "NTA, stay in school and keep on making decisions that are best for your future", "I wouldn't lift a finger to help them. They dug their own grave and are trying to pull you down with them. Don't let them.", "NTA. True, your advice to them made complete sense, and you're not responsible for their decision.", "Your brother could ask his church for assistance, if he hasn\u2019t already. Don\u2019t know where you live, but round here church\u2019s often offer daycare/wee trips for disabled children, crowdfunded by the community with some help from the church itself.", "NTA. Good for you for using their words against them (not being sarcastic).", "NTA, however, if you live with your parents you may want to move out. Your brother and kid will be moving in soon and you'll be the default carer.", "NTA. He wanted the kid because he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be the one doing the work.", "NTA, you brother should just get on with it because it's 'God's will'.... He was the one who pushed it therefore he is needs to take the full responsibility. It's ridiculous that he is thinks that he is entitled to anyone else's time and help.", "Nta not your kid not your problem keep up the schooling", "You should never be responsible for the care of someone else's child. You warned your brother that a lot of extra care would be involved with taking care of a baby with special needs and, ultimately, that care is not up to you to provide. You need to focus on yourself and your education. Furthermore, it sounds like your brother just wants help but has no intentions to pay you if you were to provide care. I understand that family helps family, but you can not be expected to leave school and be a full-time care provider with no payment. You would be sacrificing your education and wouldn't be advancing in your own goals and life. NTA", "He got himself into this. You have every right to stay out. It's not your life or future. He was told this child would have no meaningful life.", "NTA he not only chose but actively pushed his wife to have a kid who was going to be very challenging, it\u2019s literally his cross to bear\n\nWell done for standing your ground and using your parents words against them", "NTA. If you help, I'm afraid they would always need your help and you'd never get your life back. Continue your studies and live your own life. Your brother made the decision to have this child and he is responsible for them.

Will they pay your rent? \n\nYour brother needs to do some research to find out what programs your niece might qualify for.", "Your brother js a dick.  He was all kinds of \"this is God's will' when he thought his wife was going to do all the work.\n\nWhy are you sparing his feelings? He still isn't doing the work if your mom is taking care of your nice.", "NTA. Why do you go ahead and tell him it\u2019s gods will though.", "NTA - He made the choice against solid advice and his wife\u2019s wishes.  You do you.

You can choose to help sometimes when you are available. But you are not his nurse or his nanny. You gave him your advice before your niece was born. And, while you may love her to death, he did not want to hear anything. And he was not prepared for the reality of her needs. You were told to mind your business. And now he needs you.\nI feel for your brother, I do. And he needs to find a job that will give him the flexibility to take care of her. There are a lot of WFH jobs out there, depending on his field. But a lot of people work outside their field as well. However. He essentially forced his wife to have a child she did not want. And now he is seeing that it may have torn his family apart. Family therapy is probably necessary for him and his wife. And it'll be a very hard road for them.", "NTA. Why doesn't your brother find someone from his church to help out? It would make more sense than making you give up your life. He was told the situation before the child was born and had time to try to put a support system for him and his wife in place.", "NTA.

Have your brother pray hard and you send him your best wishes and thoughts and let God help him.  You are correct to staying out of it.", "NTA.

You can\u2019t step in an enable the situation. Do pray for them all separately if you are the praying type. This crisis time will pass and its easy to feel like its all about you because you are young and vulnerable and feel strongly. Try to build up a support at school \u2014 Book multiple appointments with a counsellor and agree to nothing without consulting extensively. You could be legally put in a bad position if you even babysit the child. Perhaps they will have to put her in foster care.

Having a severely disabled child is so very difficult for all involved; it is emotionally, physically and financially draining. But that\u2019s the decision he talked his wife into. She wanted to terminate - probably because deep down she knew she wasn\u2018t equipped to deal with  a severely handicapped child and a 5-year-old. She couldn\u2019t handle it - it was too much for her so she left. I can empathize with that.   \n\n\nNow your brother is doing all the work she had done and guess what? He is realizing how hard it really is. But that responsibility doesn\u2019t transfer to you simply because your his sister.

A severely disabled child is not something that one person can care for. Both you and your SIL tried to get your brother to understand this. He decided to stand on his principles. Admirable perhaps, but doing so has consequences.  He is now asking those around him to take responsibility for the consequences of his stand. Life doesn't work that way.  \n\nBTW, I'm not taking a side on the abortion issue but it's past time that the pro-life side stepped in up to deal with the inevitable consequences of their position, with increased social services etc. Their failure to do so does is repulsive.", "NTA\n\nThis is the root of it:\n\n> My (F24) brother (32)\n\nIgnore the rest of it.

And she was born with deformations and disabilities. \n\nSorry if I do not go further than that. \n\nMy brother was home for two weeks then he went back to work. My sister-in-law was basically responsible for that poor baby girl for the next six months. Plus my five year old nephew. She couldn't take it and she took their son and moved to her parents' house. \n\nMy brother has been trying to get her to come home but she won't. My parents both work so they cannot help as much as they would like. \n\nHe asked me for help and it took everything I had not to say that it was God's will that he take care of his daughter since he wanted her to be born so badly. \n\nInstead I just said that I couldn't because I couldn't watch her and go to school. He said that the help he was getting from the government and family was not enough and that he was going to lose his job. I apologized but I said I could not sacrifice my future for his decisions. \n\nHe tried getting my parents to convince me but I told them that I had been informed by them that I should \"stay out of it\". And I was choosing to do so as I had done so previously. \n\nMy mom is having to take time off to help him and it is draining her. \n\nI had lunch with my sister-in-law yesterday and I asked her when she was going home.
