Problem solved.", "You don't want her to pay half the mortgage. You want her to pay rent, I think that is where you have gone wrong here.\n\nIf she is paying half the mortgage, then you should be inclusive and make sure it is also in her name.", "Info - why can\u2019t you pay the mortgage and she pay you rent?  Or she could pay utilities?  It seems like you are arguing over semantics.  She states she is willing to pay rent on a separate apartment.  Regardless of what you call it, she isn\u2019t paying down your mortgage, she is paying to live in an apartment owned by someone else.", "YTA. Sort of. You basically want her to pay rent ie help you build equity by helping pay off your mortgage when she won't be building equity at all. That's setting her up to have nothing if you break up. She's upset because you're treating her like a tenant not a future wife. What you're doing speaks of doubt to her about her. Either get married and put her name on the property so her money is also building something (act like a true partner) or encourage her to buy on her own. Bigger issue - why is she paying her mom's mortgage? Seems like you shouldn't live together without marriage and if you don't want to marry her - why?", "Easy solution make her pay rent instead and use that for the morgage.", "YTA for being really dismissive of her concerns. I would be very cautious if I was her, too. She has zero protections if she moved in with you, renting she does. If you\u2019re going to move in, you should absolutely have a legal agreement in place over who put in what and how much you would both get in the event of a breakup.", "So, here\u2019s my take\n\nSomeone should only be paying half the mortgage if they\u2019re on the property.  Not wanting to share ownership is completely reasonable but then a reasonable rent with all legal tenant protections is a must.\n\nSo you should first find out what you could rent a room for based ok current market- your mortgage is irrelevant to market rate, it\u2019d be the same if you owned it outright\n\nHowever the second piece of this is asking how much they\u2019re willing to pay rent period.  If gf is only willing to pay 800 in rent a month to share a rental home (and that\u2019s actually possible in your market, no low balling), if you opted to go after a bigger place you need to be willing to make up the difference.  She shouldn\u2019t be paying for your excess in tastes (maybe slightly as that\u2019s how compromises work but not much).\n\nIf the \u201cgoing rent\u201d and her budget are wildly out of sync if going rent is less than her budget I\u2019d say you just take market rate in the rent as her budget would get HER bigger.\n\nIf the going rent is way out of her budget but again, it would get her a place in your market just smaller, I think you need to evaluate your relationship.  Are you going to be willing to take on a higher percentage pf housing costs to be together and not carry resentment", "Need more info.  How much would she pay for market local rent versus what you're asking for half of the mortgage?  Also are you going to have her pay half the utilities or not?", "I agree that o would rather rent somewhere else and share 50/50 then pay my boyfriends mortgage. It\u2019s about power dynamics. A shared apartment would be both of yours. An apartment you purchase is YOUR apartment that she lives in.they are very different things.", "YTA. You are paying the deposit on the condo. Understood. But, even though the entire asset will be in your name only... you expect her to pay mortgage AND interest on the remaining $250,000 owed on YOUR investment. AND she will have NO legal protection because you are not married. \nYTA, and a slick one. I hope your girlfriend sees you for what you are.", "For me, if you want this relationship to work then YTA because it\u2019s not just about money. It\u2019s about equality in your relationship and power, by suggesting you move in together into a house only you will own suggests that a) you don\u2019t see this really being long term and b) you don\u2019t see her as your equal. Whether that\u2019s true or not is a different matter. \nAll you need to do is get a document drawn up splitting the ownership 70/30 or protecting your deposit and then everyone is happy. It doesn\u2019t have to be all or nothing. \nIf you want her to pay half the mortgage and then split the bills as well while she is getting no equity you are using her to make money on your investment and that\u2019s no way to treat a partner. It creates a massive power imbalance which will impact your relationship. Yes it might be cheaper than her renting her own place but that\u2019s not the point because she\u2019d always feel like a guest in yours. Why don\u2019t you want to help her build her future at the same time as you build yours?", "YTA for basing her rent off the mortgage price, yes. She shouldn't be paying the mortgage on a place if her name isn't on the title. However, she can pay a reasonable amount for \"rent\" to live there. But then you should be paying all the property maintenance expenses like a landlord.", "She would be paying rent anywhere she was. DO NOT PUT HER NAME ON YOUR MORTGAGE. Nothing good will come of that.", "if she is not putting  anything down then she is not paying half the mortgage.  She is paying rent.  From your comments the rent you are asking her to pay is below market and you would be responsible for utilities/repairs.  Sounds like she is expecting a free ride.  And your girlfriend is paying her mothers mortgage?  without any ownership?  Is this a cultural thing?\n\nNTA.", "YTA - why would she contribute half to your mortgage?   Why would anyone ever want to be their SO\u2019s landlord?\n\nI\u2019d leave you too and go get my own apartment!", "NTA she is getting a very good deal on rent. She is not putting a dime down in down payment. It is your property and she is the tenant.", "If her name isn\u2019t on the deeds, she should not pay the mortgage.\n\nHowever\u2026 it\u2019s right that she contributes \u201crent\u201d to live in the apartment at a fair rate. Possibly 50%, possibly a different, most likely lower amount.\n\nSoft YTA for confusing terms and requesting she pay half the mortgage.", "I wouldn\u2019t do this either tbh. But I would just get my own apartment and break up. I don\u2019t think you should put her name on the house; but I also don\u2019t think she should stick around and help pay your mortgage. You\u2019re supposed to be partners, but you\u2019re both being pretty selfish. You\u2019re not ready for this step.", "YTA, you are basically trying have the benefit of owning your house and renting it at the same time. I do understand her reaction and would also rather rent something alone than have the person I'm with take advantage of me like that. \n\nAt best you could ask her to pay for 50% of the interest of the loans, the rest is basically money that you saving   and can, usually, get back when selling the property. \n\nI'm not sure how it work in your country, but in some  you can buy a house with someone without both having 50% of the property, that could be a solution here. You could also let her pay most of the mortgage so that in the end you both put as much in the property.", "If she\u2019s paying then her name gets to be on it. This is step one of you trying to financially abuse/manipulate her. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want her name on it then just charge her rent. Not the rest of the amount that you can\u2019t afford with interest.", "If the home will be in your name only then she shouldn\u2019t contribute towards the mortgage or your home\u2019s upkeep. It would be crazy for her to do that and not have any equity should your relationship fail. In the uk you can set up a deed of trust that protects the money you invested in the home should you split up. Is there something like that you could have? \n\nAgain in the UK if you pay towards someone\u2019s mortgage and the maintenance of it and any home improvements then you would be eligible to equity in that home. So it would be best if you don\u2019t want her on the deeds for her to contribute towards the bills and not the mortgage. \n\nAlso I would never advise anyone to take the deal you offered her. She would have nothing if you broke up. \n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nDown payment isn\u2019t the full payment. \n\nIf you want her to pay a portion of the mortgage then get a contract written up that any equity built after purchase will be shared but the down payment portion remains yours. \n\nThe way you are treating her now, especially telling her she can rent from you at a stupid price, is horrific and imo shows you both have no future.", "Why would she want to pay your mortgage and not be in the lease I totally get it. Get a fairly divided mortgage signed up so at least her money is putting jnto the house that is represented by the share she will own", "If she\u2019s paying 50% then she\u2019s needs writing into the deeds. 200k down from you is ~40% equity. Of the ~ 60% left to pay IF she is paying 50% then at end of mortgage she SHOULD hold ~30% equity and your ~70%.\n\nYTA if you don\u2019t write her in for what she\u2019ll be paying. What\u2019s to stop you walking away in ten years and she legally has no say\u2026", "Edit: YTA for misrepresenting the situation and consequently causing the conflict It should have been phrased as \"As I will be the sole owner, it is just that you are treated as a tenant and pay only the tenant charges. In addition, as you are partner, your rent will be half the mortgage, because it is lower than half the market rent.\"\n\nIf she is still making a scandal after that, she is financially fucking you. Plus, I do not like her sacrificing her finances for her mother. I suggest you discuss the financial aspects of that relationship with a lawyer.", "NTA - her financial commitments to her mother mean she cant contribute to your house purchase so why would she be on the deeds?\n\nAbsurd she is happy to pay rent to someone else but not you.", "NAH.\n\nBut don't call it paying the mortgage 50/50. If you agree to that, what happens if you break up? Suddenly it's not mortgage, now it's rent?\n\nI get it, she doesn't want to pay your mortgage off for you while not owning half a house.\n\nBut you charging a low/fair rent is reasonable too.\n\nNobody is wrong here.", "NTA. There\u2019s no reason for her name to be on this property. You guys are not married, and she\u2019s not contributing to the down payment.\n\nHer paying for part of the mortgage while she lives there is no different from her paying rent. \n\nJust because you guys are dating does not mean she\u2019s in any position to be gaining equity on the property.", "YTA. You want her to pay 50% for a mortgage for an asset that will be on your name only. So if you split everything will be yours and she will have nothing.\n\nI don't care if current rent is more. You buy yourself that and she can rent something cheaper for herself.", "I agree she should not be on the deed for paying towards half of the mortgage, but as such, with her name not on the 500k apartment\u2019s deed, her name shouldn\u2019t be on the deed or mortgage if it\u2019s not her property. if you want her to pay 50% of the mortgage to live there, that\u2019s perfectly fine, but if she\u2019s not an owner of the property, that 50% of the mortgage she would be paying is rent. The rent she\u2019s paying you can be used to pay the mortgage BUT it\u2019s rent.\n if her name isn\u2019t on anything and she\u2019s paying rent to you for you to be able to pay the mortgage, then she deserves a legal rental agreement that gives her normal tenants right such as: OP not being able to raise rent above a certain percentage during the contract period, OP not being able to kick her out without 30-60 days notice, etc etc as well as give OP rights so that if she leaves before the contract period ends, then she has to pay OP at least an extra months rent. Obviously I was just stating typical rental contract terms, but yall could work together to make them as fair as you think. Honestly it sounds like a good deal for her bc it\u2019s cheaper rent, but tbh I would not like my partner as my landlord without a rental agreement that gives us both legal protections in case anything happens. Especially like what if you got into an accident and unfortunately passed away? She would just be kicked out, potentially without any notice, if there was no contract and the house would go to whoever is in your will. Whereas if there\u2019s a contract, she would legally be able to stay until the contract was up or they would have to give her a certain amount of notice, etc etc (whatever is in the contract).\n\nTLDR: Basically that set up of her paying half the mortgage without her name on anything technically works but I would highly highly highly suggest a rental agreement for BOTH of your sakes and I think that\u2019s honestly probably what\u2019s holding her back: no legal protections in case something happens (break up, death, etc etc) and she could end up homeless. Or it\u2019s that she doesn\u2019t want a power imbalance of landlord/tenant (with or without a contract/rental agreement) within the relationship which I think is understandable. \n\nI hope that makes sense! LMK if want clarification on anything I said above.", "YTA\u2026. If I am going to stay somewhere and I am paying for it, I would need some legal entitlement towards it. And by this I mean, if u are looking at this as rent not downpayment, make a rent agreement in her name where she pays u the amount u want. What stops u from kicking her out tomm or after a breakup? If she has nothing to show towards her contribution???  Likewise, u cannot accept someone trying to mooch of u too which is correct. Her issue seems like wanting some security so find a way go do that instead of both getting an unfair deal", "INFO:\n\nIf she COULD put down 1/2 the DP and have her name on the mortgage would you want her to? Feels relevant.", "If she's your wife to be and the woman you want to live with, why don't you share with her. I'd put my wife on my house even if she didn't pay anything.\n\nWeird weird.", "Are you in a relationship with this woman or not? You're being REALLY transactional about this. In the strictest, most mercenary and fact-based terms NTA but I wouldn't want to be with someone who's going to act like this about a place we want to live together. Presumably if you're moving in together it's serious enough to be thinking about being together for life. This is not how to start that. She doesn't want to be in 2033, 150k deep into this place and having no equity or stake in it because you treated her like a tenant when you should have been treating her like a potential life partner.\n\nThere are ways to protect both of you financially instead of just yourself. Look into those and show this woman you actually give a shit about her.", "YTA. \n\nIf she's paying the mortgage she should get a share of the equity pro-rated against her contribution to the deposit. \n\nYou're in a relationship, you're not her landlord. She can't be contributing to your asset that you will own 100% of, and end up with nothing if the relationship ends.", "NTA but I think there are a few steps you need to take. She isn't going to be paying half the mortgage she is going to be paying you rent. She will have no stake or equity in the house. For both of your security there should be a lease. I would not want to pay for a place that I could be kicked out of at any time. Also, she should not be responsible for any repairs or upgrades same as a tenant wouldn't be.", "YTA. She should have equity, you can get a deed of interest made which specifies you get your deposit back in the event of a sale and then the equity is split.", "Don\u2019t call it half of the mortgage. Call her rent like the rent she would be paying if she lived anywhere else.", "I thought if she can prove in a break up that she paid towsrds the mortage directly she is partly-owner of the apartment, dosn't matter not being on the title. In this case you should work out a rent agreement so its clear she is only renting and doesn't pay towards the maintenance of the flat. But i get it not wanting to have your bf as your landlord, so maybe its best she rents her own apartment then.", "Then call it rent because that\u2019s what it is. Offer her up the amount you would charge a rent or and if she doesn\u2019t want it move on.", "NTA. But rephrase it. She\u2019s paying rent not the mortgage. This is for both your benefits.

Let her sign a lease and put the money as rent. Easy as that.", "Unpopular opinion but imma say YTA, simply because that\u2019s your girl, setting up as a tenant is setting a bad precedent assuming that you hope to one day build a life with her, this may be different in different customs but from where I\u2019m from you don\u2019t use your future wife as a roommate to cover cost and once you are married you become one, but things are different in different places of the world I suppose. This may also open up a bigger question for you to reflect on if you see this woman as a potential future wife, it may be a matter of differences in what you two want hense incompatibility that you may or may not be able to work around.

When you are both paying rent, you are simply paying the cost of living in the place, so 50:50 is fair. When YOU own the house, she is increasing your equity stake in the house by paying her 50%.

She gets none here while also contributing 50% to the mortgage.", "[removed]", "Maybe in that specific place but maybe could find a cheaper place", "Well, he kind of is, actually. He\u2019s getting someone else to pay for half of his mortgage, but he\u2019s the only person who\u2019s going to benefit from that in the long run.", "Sure he is, I highly doubt during tax time the OP is going to claim the additional 13,200 in income from his GF and pay taxes on it which a real landlord would have to do.", "Your insistence in communicating like a child really says a lot, do you realize that? \n\nIt's funny, because what you are suggesting is what I agree they should do. They should enter an actual landlord/tenant agreement. But she won't do that. She wants ownership of the property, which she so very clearly doesn't qualify for. The words LEGAL PROTECTIONS in her context only apply to those that would be afforded to a tenant, which is something she doesn't care about because she wants to be co-owner. Your argument is completely invalid because she has already rejected the idea of being a tenant. \n\nThey should enter a landlord /tenant agreement until such time as a significant portion of the mortgage has been settled. If they're still together (and still unmarried) then her name can be put on the deed to the corresponding percentage of ownership she is owed.", "She could. \nI'm sure the problem is the assets in this story.\nThat's the one you and her are worried about.\nHis first mistake was telling her how much his mortgage is, and second is he should just use the words rent to his gf.", "[removed]", "She's definitely benefiting in the long run by paying less than half in rent.", "Again, more bullshit assumptions.\n\nIdiot."]}
