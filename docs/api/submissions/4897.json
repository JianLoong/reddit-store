I made a lot of friends from america, specifically one we\u2019ll call Cameron (19M). We\u2019ve been really good friends for around 4 1/2 years now. I appreciate Cameron for always being there for me, but recently we got into an argument. Now, I like keeping to myself, I don\u2019t like people telling me how i should live. I enjoy drawing, art etc. But I specifically like making NSFW art (overage characters always, and never of me of course). I understand I am not 18 yet, but I have never ever drawn any character that isn\u2019t of age. I also understand that i can 100% be the asshole here or even if i\u2019m not, what I did i shouldn\u2019t have been doing anyways. I use drawing to cope with a lot of thing. I made an account on twitter to post these drawings, never with hashtags or any way to relate this account to me. But somehow, he found it. This has happened before with different situations, where i\u2019ll do something in my life he doesn\u2019t agree with (even if it isn\u2019t anywhere near as serious as this) and immediately come to me telling me i\u2019m wrong, i shouldn\u2019t be doing this or that etc. I did not make this account to grow, gain attraction or anything, i just wanted somewhere to post because in a way it makes me feel proud of myself (the wrong way to phrase that sentence but i\u2019m not great at phrasing things under pressure, sorry).\n\nHe came to me with screenshots of the account telling me to take it down, it\u2019s wrong, i\u2019m too young and i don\u2019t understand what i\u2019m doing, yet i\u2019m well aware. I made the account for no one but myself and genuinely just forgot to private it.

The very fact that this erotic art is your creative product defeats the argument that you are too young to understand what you are doing yet.  You are expressing yourself in a way that harms zero people, and you should be proud of your art.\n\nOTOH, he seems to be cyberstalking you, and that is cause enough to end whatever friendly relationship you have with him.", "NTA, he is stalking you. He has no point, it\u2019s not caring it\u2019s trying to control.I knew a guy that tried to do that to me. He tried ti turn it on me but failed. Don\u2019t let him control you.", "Okay, NTA but i would STRONGLY advise you to think about the relationship you two have. Unless your phone number or email was linked to the account, I find it very odd that he found the account AND knew it was you. And the fact that this has happened multiple time with other things, it makes me slightly worried that he is keeping tabs on you like this. You\u2019re an underage female (not saying this has anything to do with sex/gender directly), and he is a male two years older. You two met when he was 15 and you were 12/13- he was learning how to drive a car and you weren\u2019t even out of grade school yet!!! Although I don\u2019t know you, him, or the context regarding the \u201ctimes this has happened before\u201d, but PLEASE do not give him any more info on yourself or the people you\u2019re close with. This feels like \u201cearly stage stalking\u201d behavior, and for him to be this controlling from a different country (or at least i think he is from how you described it), that\u2019s a big red flag.", "NTA.  \"Cameron\", who is likely far older than 19, has been grooming you for years, and is now upset that you developed a life outside of his.", "NTA. Your art and expression are totally yours to do whatever you want with. I do think if you post art publicly then you\u2019re open to any reactions the public has, but this is super creepy that he feels he has that kind of control or say in your life.", "NTA I'm getting very creepy vibes from this situation. There are a lot of red flags in his behavior. Consider cutting off the relationship.", "NTA, lots of 17yos do this kind of thing. You're not a child and not hurting anyone. But if he's constantly finding things out about you that you haven't told him and then trying to exert control over your life you may need to reassess the friendship.\n\nExpressing concern is one thing, trying to control you is another.\n\nWhile I don't know you or him, everything you've said here seems to be a massive red flag in the way he acts towards you and it might be safer/healthier for you to end the relationship and block him. It sounds like he's stalking you tbh.", "NTA\n\nYou should break off any kind of contact with that person, it sounds like he is very controlling and has no right to be. And you are allowed to be proud of your art! in whichever way you decide to share it with people, is your decision", "NTA and drop contact with him entirely. I grew up playing PC games and had similar things happen to me and it was never good. The guy is a creep and trying to hide behind \u201cprotecting\u201d you. When in reality they were annoyed I wasn\u2019t interested in anything more than friendship. \n\nHe\u2019s actively cyberstalking you and then trying to convince you that you mentioned it in passing.", "Im more concerned about your safety tbh.\n\nHow is he finding out info about your family/partner?  Are you sure he REALLY lives halfway around the world from you?\n\nTo me (I took criminal justice classes in college, I have a dual major in criminal justice and forensic science) it sounds like he is cyber stalking you.  \n\nI am not am expert, by any means, nor am I the legal expert.   But from my (admittedly limited) knowledge of computers and stuff, unless you shared your screen names/your location/your tags with him, shouldn't the information about your family/partner be hard to find unless he specifically went looking? \n\nI don't want to scare you, but I'm worried about you.\n\nAs far as your question in your post, NTA.  it's normal for teenagers to express themselves how they feel comfortable.  For you, that's your art.  What you do with it, as long as it is safe and legal, is no one's business but your own.", "Tough. I\u2019ll say NTA, he shouldn\u2019t be, in your words, prying into your life. Of course you should\u2019ve made the account private, but oh well. You do you (unless it\u2019s illegal) and you shouldn\u2019t have anybody (one that lives halfway across the world no less) tell you what to do, especially as (almost) an adult", "NTA and if this guy is searching out stuff like that its pretty creepy. \n\nAlso remember that its ok to end a friendship with someone for any reason.

At first I thought this was going to be a somewhat standard issue of cultural difference because Americans do have a tendency to overshare and not have a sense of privacy, but this is beyond that. Your friend is shaming you for your hobby.", "NAH but yikes, he may have a point. Your future employers will find these accounts if he did.

Right now OP wants this art form to be her career. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with that.

It\u2019s difficult to cut people off when you\u2019re all in the same friend group, so if that doesn\u2019t seem possible, just keep him at an arms distance. Don\u2019t rant to him anymore, talk about current things in your life or places you\u2019re going to! Make sure any information he\u2019s getting (if you choose to not cut him off) is \u201ca day behind\u201d so you have control over the info he\u2019s getting from you directly!

If he reaches out via email, to the same there too. Maybe being on the other part of the world would make him leave you alone. Just be careful what you share online from now on.", "Thank you so much!!", "it was a new email because i didn\u2019t want anyone i knew finding it", "Haha thank you! i\u2019ve had this way of thinking for a long time since i\u2019m aware of right and wrong, i feel like i know what\u2019s best for me so that\u2019s what i\u2019ll do! :)", "That's so weird tbh, that gives me the ick that he somehow found it", "NTA ..
