So you either suffer in silence and allow wounds to fester into something even worse, or have a conversation like fucking adults.\n\nDon't pick your battles. Pick your partners.", "Usually it's I prefer to be right and happy, if both are not possible, then why I am in these relationships?", "Except he is kind of getting a pass in a situation where\u2019s he\u2019s clearly in the wrong\u2014 but somehow she still has to split blame with him? \n\nWhat is this\u2026 the check?\n\nThey already had an arrangement that worked. He had no desire to change this arrangement when *she* was spending on *him* all day. \n\nShe simply did not want to suddenly change their previous agreement and have to start paying *more* than him\u2014 after already paying more for him. How is she in the wrong? What does she need a pass for? There\u2019s nothing wrong with not wanting to feel like your partner is taking advantage of you. His actions were cheap. She\u2019s not wrong to call him on it.", "He was a very hard person to like", "Some people are just cheap and count every dollar spent on someone else.", "Exactly.  It's important to be willing to admit you're wrong.  But that goes for both partners.    \n\n\nIf I'm going to get attacked for bringing facts, I'd much rather be alone.", "Because you can be right about the bird you just saw being a Red-Crested Cardinal and not a Red-Crested Woodpecker, but not want to belabor the point. We don't date logical machines, we date flawed human beings.", "A human being that would get upset about an accurate identification they disagreed with is too flawed to date."]}
