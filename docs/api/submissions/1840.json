They have a neurological disorder and don't realize WHEN they're going to vomit, we find out when it happens. The smell of pot makes us both violently vomit.\n\nMy neighbors (apartment complex - no smoking) smoke a TON. So much that the halls of all the floors REEK of pot. Lately it's gotten BAD. I can't open my front door. My husband props open the main door to the building as it's the only way to air it out, but other people get irritated and shut it (one person even shattered the block used to prop it open), but without airing out the halls, the smell seeps into our place so much that I literally can't even sit in my own living room or use my kitchen. We are stuck hiding in my kid's room or my room. If I go in the living room, I vomit. Not to mention my kid. \n\nNow, I don't judge people who smoke. But don't *force* others to have to smell it. It smells like the south end of a skunk, not a field of violets. \n\nI've left a note on the front door very briefly explaining my child's condition and asking kindly if smoking could be done out on a balcony (it's still an average of 80\u00b0F during the day here), but not calling out anyone specific. \nNo luck. A month later, a sterner note asking whoever it is to *please* try to disperse the smell as best they can as it is negatively impacting others. No luck. \nToday, I've had it. I left a note yesterday saying nobody else should have to live with the stench of pot, and it needs to stop.\" Mean? Probably. But I'm sick of vomiting 4-5 times a day AND my kid getting sick as many times. \n\nSo I finally called my property manager and she asked who it was. My husband went out smelling. (I cant) He also described where the smell was the worst in our place. Between him, a maintenance guy, and the property manager, they determined it was the neighbor. \nWell, the PM sent an email to them saying they received a complaint about smell and as a reminder it's a strict no smoking property, and violation would result in eviction. \n\nIn retaliation, my neighbors have decided to blaze up ALL DAY. Literally ALL DAY. My husband had to leave for work, and I had to door dash lunch and dinner for myself and my toddler. I tried to do a load of laundry holding my breath, and I nearly vomited in the hall, I just couldn't make it. I tried. So after 7 hours, I finally caved and called the PM in tears because we can't leave the bedroom. \n\nIt sounds like they will be getting a final warning but others have complained too. \n\nI feel bad. I don't want to be a \"Karen\" and I told the PM that multiple times. I felt bad even involving her but I literally can't even function in my own home anymore! \n\nThe worst part is, these guys have 3 kids including an infant. \n\nMy husband feels I'm entirely justified in involving the PM but I still can't help but feel guilty I might be forcing 3 going kids out of their home right before Christmas.\n\nEdit: Just as an example of how badly they've been doing it *all day*, it's 11pm and the hall is still too smelly for me to go out the door. My husband just came home and told me he propped the door again to try and drain the smell from the halls. \n\nAlso, for those who've asked why I didn't say something sooner - my parents live about 20 minutes away and my husband works 2nd (and sometimes 2nd and 3rd) shift, so most weeks, my little one and I are at my parents' house during the weekdays, and home more on weekends when we can do things as a family (park, drive in movies, etc)", "created_utc": 1667947708, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yq14s7/aita_for_possibly_getting_my_neighbors_with_kids/", "score": 184, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My husband had tried before and wasn't sure if it was them, or someone upstairs and we didn't want to cause issues with the wrong people. \nToday when he was trying to sort it out (because it was STRONG) he happened to luck out because apparently the husband/boyfriend opened their door as he (husband) was walking toward the laundry room, after that there was no doubt.\n\nBut the first note wasn't passive aggressive at ALL, nor was the second, it was literally like \"Hey, whoever is doing this, it's really affecting a child with special needs - here's how. If anything can be done to lessen the smell, we'd appreciate it\" \n\nI mean, I shouldn't have to out my kid's diagnosis but I did to try and let them know it's doing harm, but they ignored it. And anyone who is informed they're doing harm, but continues to ignore it is kind of a jerk. But thats just my opinion.

They were just living their lives in their own home."]}
