They have a neurological disorder and don't realize WHEN they're going to vomit, we find out when it happens. The smell of pot makes us both violently vomit.\n\nMy neighbors (apartment complex - no smoking) smoke a TON. So much that the halls of all the floors REEK of pot. Lately it's gotten BAD. I can't open my front door. My husband props open the main door to the building as it's the only way to air it out, but other people get irritated and shut it (one person even shattered the block used to prop it open), but without airing out the halls, the smell seeps into our place so much that I literally can't even sit in my own living room or use my kitchen. We are stuck hiding in my kid's room or my room. If I go in the living room, I vomit. Not to mention my kid. \n\nNow, I don't judge people who smoke. But don't *force* others to have to smell it. It smells like the south end of a skunk, not a field of violets. \n\nI've left a note on the front door very briefly explaining my child's condition and asking kindly if smoking could be done out on a balcony (it's still an average of 80\u00b0F during the day here), but not calling out anyone specific. \nNo luck. A month later, a sterner note asking whoever it is to *please* try to disperse the smell as best they can as it is negatively impacting others. No luck. \nToday, I've had it. I left a note yesterday saying nobody else should have to live with the stench of pot, and it needs to stop.\" Mean? Probably. But I'm sick of vomiting 4-5 times a day AND my kid getting sick as many times. \n\nSo I finally called my property manager and she asked who it was. My husband went out smelling. (I cant) He also described where the smell was the worst in our place. Between him, a maintenance guy, and the property manager, they determined it was the neighbor. \nWell, the PM sent an email to them saying they received a complaint about smell and as a reminder it's a strict no smoking property, and violation would result in eviction. \n\nIn retaliation, my neighbors have decided to blaze up ALL DAY. Literally ALL DAY. My husband had to leave for work, and I had to door dash lunch and dinner for myself and my toddler. I tried to do a load of laundry holding my breath, and I nearly vomited in the hall, I just couldn't make it. I tried. So after 7 hours, I finally caved and called the PM in tears because we can't leave the bedroom. \n\nIt sounds like they will be getting a final warning but others have complained too. \n\nI feel bad. I don't want to be a \"Karen\" and I told the PM that multiple times. I felt bad even involving her but I literally can't even function in my own home anymore! \n\nThe worst part is, these guys have 3 kids including an infant. \n\nMy husband feels I'm entirely justified in involving the PM but I still can't help but feel guilty I might be forcing 3 going kids out of their home right before Christmas.", "created_utc": 1667947708, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yq14s7/aita_for_possibly_getting_my_neighbors_with_kids/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
