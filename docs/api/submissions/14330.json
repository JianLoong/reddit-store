Would you consider visiting for a few days? It\u2019s not totally unreasonable to introduce partners to parents after a year of dating. Would you ever feel comfortable visiting Ohio?", "Why not go for a few days not a month, also there are asian people living in Ohio. The worse complaint there is its flat,", "Weird I\u2019m an Asian woman who moved to Ohio and I don\u2019t feel unsafe out here. Maybe I\u2019m sheltered. Anyway, whatever your reasons are yours, you\u2019re not the AH for not going.", "NAH.  Your boyfriend asked, you declined.  A month is a long time for a \u2018meet the parents\u2019 visit.  Could you go for a few days while he is there?", "1 and 3 are reasonable. Ohio has Asian people so you should be good on the middle one.\n\n4 makes you an ass", "ESH.\n\nIf he has issues with reasons 1 and 3, he is being unreasonable. 7 months isn't that long, and you already had plans with your own family. It doesn't matter if tickets/hotels are booked; if you and your siblings talked about it, are excited about it, and fully plan to do it, that's all that matters. \n\nNow, girrrlllll.... you KNOW you're an AH for reasons 2 and 4. I say this as a minority who grew up in NYC and moved to Virginia for my husband. Contrary to what the media will have you believe about people in rural areas/red states (and, FWIW, Ohio is a swing state), most people in this country aren't shit-kicking hillbillies who hate minorities. Maybe they've never been around someone of your race, but that just mean they'll do a double take, and that's it. If I saw a 7 foot man or someone with dwarfism, I'd probably discreetly do the same, but it's not because of any nefarious reasons. \n\nAnd there are just as many AHs in Ohio as there are in California, New York, Colorado,  Connecticut, etc. And, tbh, some of them are worse.

You're not serious about him.  Fair enough - break it off.  Stop making excuses about his family - the real reason that it isn't a serious relationship for you, so be honest and go surfing.

If he's asking you to go there for a month that's unreasonable, especially if you already have plans with your family.\n\nI can't comment on safety as I'm not American, but that does sound slightly odd to me. Family members who are POC have travelled to rural areas in America and had no issues.", "YWBTA. If you are **that** against seeing your significant other's family, a relationship is never going to work. It should be taken as a compliment and a gift that they want to take you along to meet their family, not some sort of insult/attack on your freedom of choice. In addition, your \"It's a white, Republican territory = they must be awful to Asian Americans\" opinion, is a tragic and childish one at that, fathered from who knows where, but I can promise you that it isn't going to get you far. Profiling large groups on people based on race, religion, ethnicity, or political status, is ignorant and harmful to everyone, including yourself. Try judging people **on an individual basis, once you get to know them**, and see what that does for you. Seriously. Individual personalities have next to nothing to do with the aforementioned judging points. Certainly not enough to hold a prejudice against entire groups of people based on any of them.", "Why are you stereotyping an entire state for baselessly thinking they all hate Asian people?

May I ask what part of rural Ohio he is from? (I grew up in Ohio). I am brown, spent a long time being the only person of color in my school, neighborhood, etc. While I've had my experiences, I would be super surprised if anti-Asian crap was thrown your way.

Visiting for a month is a lot, but meeting his family is NOT a big ask.  You flat out refusing and not being willing to compromise and go for at least a short visit should be a huge red flag to your BF about how serious you are or aren't about your relationship.  You admit a surfing trip to the beach is more important than your relationship!!!  If you don't want to go, you don't have to but, you can and should kiss your relationship goodbye because it's clear you don't like or value your BF or care about his feelings.", "NTA. More astronauts come from Ohio than any other state. Why? Because that\u2019s how badly they wanted to leave. My sister-in-law is from Ohio, and she\u2019ll tell you exactly how little time she wants to spend there now that she\u2019s out. All Ohio hate aside, a monthlong trip is far too long for a 7 month relationship.", "YTA, you are judgmental and he deserves better", "ESH. I don\u2019t think either of you is individually the a-hole, but that both of you\u2019ll need to learn to communicate about your issues. If it\u2019s genuinely about it being too early, that\u2019s a very different reason than not being open minded about a state your significant other comes home (and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not nice to hear things about where you come feom). On the flip side, it\u2019s wrong for him to coerce or pressure you into missing a trip with your family, and he should be more understanding if you\u2019re uncomfortable about something.\n\nJust work on communication - sounds like the teething troubles of young love - hopefully you\u2019ll get through it (or don\u2019t- in which case good riddance)", "Nta. Talk to ur bf, tell him you don't feel safe visiting Ohio. His response should tell you whether this relationship is worth continuing. I'm a poc, I've visited several predominatly white states I understand ur hesitation and there's nothing wrong with trying to protect yourself. But if this relationship continues you will eventually have to travel to Ohio. If you want this relationship to work longterm, you're going to have to figure out how to deal with your feelings about Ohio.", "NTA,\nYou\u2019ve voiced that you feel it\u2019s too soon. Maybe a first meeting in neutral territory is best, especially since while your bf may be ok with your race, his family or community might not be.

I'm from the midwest and even we make fun of Ohio but my roommate's from there and I don't go telling her she's from a shitty state or judge her for it, which it sounds like that's all you're doing with your BF and his family.

You\u2019ve been dating less than a year, you already had plans (that sound way more fun) with your family, and he wants you to stay for a month?  Nope, nope, nope. Go surfing with your brothers and have a fun summer.", "NTA - It's completely understandable that you don't feel ready to take such a big step in your relationship by visiting Nick's family in Ohio. Your concerns about being an Asian woman in a rural Midwestern state are valid, and it's important to prioritize your safety and comfort. Additionally, you already have plans to go on a surfing trip with your brothers, which you've been looking forward to. It's unfair of Nick to call you a \"shitty girlfriend\" for not wanting to go, and it's not reasonable for him to make you choose between the two. It's important to communicate your feelings to him and find a compromise that works for both of you.  \n  \nEdit: Accidentally put YTA", "NTA\n\nYou are correct, Ohio is boring.\nSource: Ohioan", "If you choose to date only white guys, a lot of them are from places like Ohio and Pennsylvania.  You may as well get used to it lol.", "NTA that is a huge ask and he should just accept your no. Most people wouldn\u2019t even visit their in-laws for that amount of time. He needs to be more understanding of your multiple reasons for not wanting to go. Stand your ground, you are very reasonable.", "NTA this time because you feel it's too soon and you already made other plans.  However, understand that if you get more serious, you **are** going to be going to Ohio semi-regularly.  It will be only fair that you alternate choosing vacation destinations, and he'll probably choose visiting his family for half or more of his picks since they aren't local.\n\nAlso, if you don't have anything but utter contempt for his family because of where they live, when you haven't even met them yet, your relationship probably isn't going to work.  That would be too big an ask of most people if the family isn't toxic.  He might not live within striking distance of them, but remember that he (presumably) loves them.  I firmly believe that partners and families of origin should do everything possible to work together not to force someone to have to choose between them.", "NTA. Life is short. Take the trip with your brother. \nThe boyfriend is right to think it's a big deal, and if you want to continue to pursue this relationship, then eventually, you will end up at least visiting Ohio.\nTimelines in relationships are for you to decide. If it's too soon for you, then it is what it is. You just need to consider that it might be a deal breaker to your BF if you are not on the same timeline as him.", "NTA. \nI think at the end of the day, no matter anyone's feelings about Ohio, you're in different spots in the relationship. He is getting more serious (wanting you to meet his parents), and it doesn't seem like that's where you see things right now. \n\nNext time you talk, don't badmouth his home state. Make it about what seems to be the real issue, that you're not ready for this step yet.", "NTA it\u2019s way too soon to go on a month long trip to Ohio, sounds like a nightmare.", "NTA... I am from NY but currently live in Ohio (outside Columbus) for work.  DON'T GO TO OHIO.", "While NTA, this decision you're making also says that this relationship is not going to be long term since his family is obviously as important to him as yours is to you.", "Definitely NTA. Ohio isn\u2019t safe for any women to visit, much less a woman of color.", "NTA\n\nIf you don't feel ready/or don't want to meet your boyfriend's parents, that is a good enough reason not to go.\n\nOn a sidenote you should really dig into somebody's background before engaging in a long term relationship. You are dating a guy who lives far away and is from an area whose people make you feel uncomfortable. These are things that needed to be sorted/addressed a while ago.\n\nThat being said; I suggest meeting people through webcam first, until you are comfortable to see them in person.", "YTA my grandma is 95 and currently living in a nursing home in Akron, Ohio. Im 400 miles away and visit her about yearly. Do you think it\u2019s a fun time to drive through Indiana and Ohio for the sole purpose of visiting a dementia care facility in Akron in the middle of November? NO. it is not fun. But I do it because I care about my grandma and I want to make sure I see her. \n\nFirst of all, it sounds like you\u2019ve never been to Ohio. Have you even been there? The Midwest in the summer can be extremely pleasant and full of life. It\u2019s also an enormous state. With yes, farmland, but also 3 major cities, a ton of history, and interesting topography towards the south and East that is great for hiking and adventures. \n\nBut even if it sucked, you wouldn\u2019t be going because it\u2019s \u201cfun\u201d you\u2019d be going because you care about your boyfriend. \n\nI don\u2019t want to disregard your concerns about racism. Depending on the area you\u2019re going to, you might get some annoying micro aggressive comments.

Yes, there are fewer Asians in the Midwest, compared to CA. But many midwest states have fairly sizeable Asian communities and lots of cities have Asian neighborhoods.

There\u2019s WAY more anti-Asian sentiment recently in CA. I can say that because I\u2019ve lived in both places, and you *always* hear about attacks in CA and NY. Not in flyover states. You\u2019re actually probably statistically safer in Midwest states. MOST people aren\u2019t MAGA Trump asshats. Those are a vocal minority. Most people are decent and kind, anywhere you go.

Why are you with him?", "There are three major cities in Ohio, Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus. Columbus has nearly a million people. This isn\u2019t even counting smaller cities like Dayton, Akron, and Youngstown.", "Exactly!  As minorities traveling outside your comfort zone geographically is all about risks. But it is risky going to rural areas. She needs to talk to her partner and explain this\u00b9", "You act like that shit doesnt happen in New York City or something. I'm Asian, I'm from semi-rural Indiana, and ya, not scared. I assure you its no worse than visiting Bakersfield or something. Not that i'd want to spend a month in Bakersfield either, but its Ohio not Syria. You arent gonna be SA'd in Ohio because you're Asian. We Asians are all over.", "Weird.l, I have yet to be in any city on the west coast without some shit caked drug addict screaming some kind of profanity at me and I am in NYC and Baltimore frequently and can honestly say I've never visited either without hearing somebody call somebody of another race a slur. (Often across the street)\n\nBut by all means go off on how some trucker whispered in your ear at a truck stop once 2 years ago and it traumatized you.", "The entire state said that? In a Zoom call, I guess.", "Surely the PSA campaign telling Asians to \"go back to their country\" is archived somewhere. Link? Crazy it didn't make the news.", "In the US, everywhere has racist people. Some places are more open than not, but that is *places* not just regions. Boston has racists, Los Angeles has racists, Miami has racists. So, slow your roll there. \n\nAlso, IL is the Midwest and while it certainly has racism and racial divides, it was a comparable beacon of hope for Black Americans during the great migration from the South. \n\nI\u2019ve lived in the Midwest, the southwestern US and the southeastern US. Ohio is the Midwest, but it\u2019s also mid-Atlantic. It has a different feel than rural IN, WI, MO, etc. So to write off a whole region, let alone state, is rather \u2026 ignorant.", "I disagree, but to each their own.", "Ohio is Yankee heartland, proud abolitionists. The Northwest territory which later divided into what is now the Midwest was the abolitionist core of the nation, slavery was illegal there before it was in New York or Massachusetts. The cultural poison of Murdoch has seeped into every part of American life, but Ohio is not Arkansas or Alabama. It is no worse than upstate New York- probably significantly better in fact, no NYPD retirees.", "Exactly. A month is waaaaay too long to stay with anyone, much less people you\u2019re just meeting.", "Manitoba is no different than Ohio, except colder.", "Like I said, if you keep only dating shire guys, this is what you get\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Whatever. I'm a white guy with full white guy privileges in a neighboring state which is just as bad. The religious conservative cults that run these states are utterly disgusting, vile, and hateful. I don't blame anyone for seeing how these states truly are and not wanting to waste their time visiting here.", "Exactly!", "Her view of Ohio is irrational.", "Sure, Jan.", "Did you not see the vids in mid west of all the racist assholes. Ohio barely has any population but is ranked top 5 in the nation for most hate crimes. Understandable that California has a significant amount considering how diverse California is. Seriously.", "Thats why I said tend. For not all areas or every state in the midwest is gonna cause those experiences. However its not shocking for people to avoid for not feeling comfortable based on that possibility. \n\nPlus you listing places that have a good amount of diversity. Every place you go is gonna have some racism. The question is what places do you feel more comfortable dealing with there.", "Am I wrong? Nowhere is asshole free. OP was still shitty to bag on her boyfriends hometown unecessarily.", "Ohio barely has any population? I think it\u2019s in the top 10 by population. Not as big as Cali, for sure, but it\u2019s not like Rhode Island small or something (no offense Rhode Islanders!)", "Ohio....barely has any population? Ohio is the 7th most populous state in America. Its the Heartland, the industrial core of the nation. It's where the tanks come from, and the astronauts. It's not Arkansas or Indiana, Ohio is a bustling, modern place.", "That's just a flat out lie you made up \n\nTop 5 states for hate crimes per Capita according to fbi crime stats:\n\nWashington DC, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon,\nKentucky\n\nFollowed by \n\nMaine,\nNorth dakota,\nConnecticut,\nColorado,\nMinnesota,\n\n\nNot only is Ohio not in the top 10,  the top 5 and 10 are dominated by coastal states. Please tell me more about a racist video you saw on the internet though.", "Ohio is 7th in population in all the USA about 12 million people.", "That\u2019s why I compared it to California. So you can see what I\u2019m comparing it to. There\u2019s other states with a larger population with less hate crime. So again,  you trying to say that \u201ceverywhere has racism\u201d can be true, but when we look at hate crimes by state, ohio is up there. I digress. Ohio is boring. It\u2019s a flyover state not worth visiting.", "I said hate crimes specifically. But go ahead and show how you lack reading comprehension", "I have to agree to disagree. \n\nCalifornia is by far the largest, that\u2019s a fact; it has the most people by over 10 million compared to the next state. But it\u2019s also had a long history of racism, particularly against East Asian and Latino/a/x peoples, and especially in certain parts of California.\n\nHate crimes have been up since 2016. They\u2019re up all over the country. Instances of hate against Asian people drastically increased during the pandemic. I agree with that too. But I\u2019m not sure where your getting your facts on Ohio; from what I\u2019ve seen Cali and NY have had the most. [hate crime stats](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2020-11-17/fbi-report-california-new-york-report-highest-numbers-of-hate-crimes)", "I (and the fbi) specified hate crimes as well. Try again", "They also said hate crimes specifically. Where did you get the idea that they didn\u2019t?", "I got my stats from the federal website. So \u201cfrom what you\u2019ve seen\u201d isn\u2019t a statistical fact. Hate crime in rural states have risen. But from 2016, who was president. Where do the supremacists stay at primarily. In rural America. Hate crimes in general have gone up, but I\u2019d feel safer in California than I would in Ohio as an Asian woman.", "I and the fbi, know that in 2020, Ohio had the 3rd highest amount of hate crimes of the entire country. And what I\u2019m referring to, again, your reading comprehension is lacking, and you\u2019re probably from Ohio so you\u2019re hurt by what I said, that Ohio is a state with a lot of racism in its density, but my key point is that I\u2019d rather be  in California than Ohio as an Asian woman. Because I\u2019m less likely to face an isolated incident there in California than Ohio. Let\u2019s not forget that just in February Ohio declared racism a public health crisis there. Also Ohio is named worst state for economic racial equality. Sooooo. Again. One of the worst states to live in. Even Dave Chapelle says it, but he stays because he wants to try and make it better.", "Sorry to be a bother, but which federal website are you using? \n\nI was trying to find the stats by state and am having a really hard time. I went to several fed websites (Justice.gov; fbi.gov) and cant find a site with a state ranking. \n\nThe best I\u2019ve been able to find (in the limited amount of research I\u2019ve been able to do during the times between these postings) is \u201cfrom what I\u2019ve seen\u201d. I promise I\u2019m not a troll or something. I\u2019m just trying to find the research to back up what you\u2019re saying.", "A quick click on my profile will show you where I was born and raised and the twin city i reside in now dork. \n\n\nYou think I have a reading comprehension problem because you can't read or comprehend statistics. I can help though. \n\nHere we are talking about hate crimes. You have looked at 1 of 6 columns (total hate crimes reported) of the same table I did and ranked them by highest to lowest. I can see where your thought process is but it's actually an incorrect way to read the data the other 5 columns mean things too! There is a reason the fbi puts all of them together!!\n\nIt is not accurate to simply rank how often something occurs in a state by simply counting the number of times a crime occurs in that state. Clearly California is the not the most dangerous state in the country for minorities even if it is arguably not the most progressive and you alluded to that so you understand your logic is flawed.\n\nThe part you missed is factoring in the populations of those states  \n\nWhen looking at crimes the most generally accurate way to asses how common they are is is by looking at how many times it happens per 100,000 people. That is the list I posted. The 3rd highest number of hate crimes in the 8th biggest population is still less often than the 15th highest number of hate crimes in the 37th. Use your noggin. \n\n\nBesides, I was only calling out your blatant misrepresentation of data. The fbi hate crimes report is a joke. The bottom 4 states simply don't report hate crimes. Ohio has 135 agencies dedicated to reporting hate crimes with a population of 7.8 mil. California has 195 to a population of 36 mil. Of course states with 1 or 2 agencies dedicated to reporting hate crimes will have less reported. That is also a column of the chart you skipped over to cherry pick the number of crimes reported to the fbi. You are either a moron or an asshole.\n\nLink of the chart we are both referencing for posterity sake:\nhttps://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2019/tables/table-12.xls", "I\u2019m using 2. The one I\u2019m referring to is statista. Because per capita isn\u2019t what I\u2019m looking for as it doesn\u2019t paint the whole picture", "It doesn\u2019t take away from the fact I have Asian family that moved from Ohio because they are constantly targeted. The amount of shit people said to them, they had to move. So we can\u2019t just take crimes, we gotta take personal accounts into this as well, what people say to other ethnicities, who makes threats, unreported threats. Ohio being one of the worst states for it. \n\nMy process is just factoring how many hate crimes were committed in one year vs other states. Because that\u2019s the only stat that mattered in this conversation. Then I take in new articles and video footage, and everything else that doesn\u2019t get reported. The fact they have to have entire agencies dedicated to this should let you know that they are racist. Your reference of stats doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that year over year there is a lot of hate crime in Ohio. So much so that it has to declare racism a public health emergency. I\u2019m not saying they are the number one state for hate crime, but as the original commenter said \u201cevery where has racism\u201d, my point was, move to the least racist state, and Ohio isn\u2019t it."]}
