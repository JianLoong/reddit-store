My stepkids were with their mom and Caelan and his best friend were talking about how disappointed they were that the best friends parents had to cancel the trip to the water park that had been arranged for weeks. I could tell the kids were upset and I decided I could take them if the parents were okay with that. My husband was fine with it happening without my stepkids as well. The reason for not waiting is my stepkids are not very accepting of my son and I felt like if I took the three of them it would be less fun for him being left out. My husband and I both do things with all the kids when we get the time and we each do individual stuff with each kid and a mix. So this isn't me trying to exclude my stepkids from everything. But I wanted my son to have a day like that where he'd enjoy it instead of feeling like the odd one out.\n\nI took them the next day with the permission of the other parents and we had a great time.

My husband told them I had taken the boys to the water park.\n\nA few days later my ILs came over while I was home alone and told me something like the water park was an inappropriate trip to take without my stepkids. They said the kids would have had such a good day and instead I left them out. I explained it was a trip that had been planned with the other boys parents and I took over when they could no longer do it. They said waiting a few days for my stepkids to be there would have been better. My husband came home while they were on me about this and he said I had the right to bring my son wherever. That his kids do stuff with their mom all the time and nobody says anything. They said it's different because she has no stepchildren. They said as a stepmom I should be prioritizing including everyone, no matter what it takes to do so.\n\nMy husband asked them to leave and they sent me a long winded message afterward saying I should work on being a better stepmom and that I was very wrong to do what I did.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692192327, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15spvij/aita_for_taking_my_son_to_the_water_park_with_his/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason I am worried I might have done the wrong thing here is things are already unsettled among my son and them and perhaps it was wrong to go without them. Waiting a few extra days would have meant they would be with my husband and I and could have joined in. I didn't because I wanted my son to have a day without being excluded by them but it might still be wrong on my part.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ### [Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

His is a good person.\n\nThe step children were not with you but with their mother.  You don not have to put your life, or your child's life on hold when the step children are with their mother.\n\nI think the GPs are upset because your step children are THEIR granschildren and your son is not their grandchild.

Your kid , your right.", "NTA. I read the headline and was ready to say you were, as I assumed your step kids must have been left at your house. But they weren\u2019t even under your watch! Do your in-laws expect you not to do anything fun with your son for the time your step kids are away??? They are awful if they expect this. It makes me wonder what their relationship to their step grandson is. Presumably not a good one.", "NTA\n\nYou were spot on and your IL's have an issue most likely with you for some reason.", "NTA and I'm SO glad your husband had your back with your inlaws.  Too many stories here would have had that position flipped. \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong.", "It's been two years and the stepchildren don't accept your biological son.  Sure it''s fine to take your son wherever whenever you so please.    The ILs are going to be giving you grief on a constant.   It's always going to be something.   Why would you marry a man knowing your son isn't accepted by your stepchildren?", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s time to let all communication with the in-laws go through your husband. Put them on silent and don\u2019t engage. Your husband sounds awesome!", "NTA. Your son deserves to have time with you without his stepsiblings. He also deserves to do fun things when his stepsiblings are with their mom.", "NTA. Your step kids didn\u2019t go because they were with their mom. It\u2019s not like you took your son and left your step kids home. Your in laws are probably concerned that you won\u2019t treat their grandkids the same as you treat your son. It\u2019s a valid concern because it does happen. I know people who experienced this growing up and the adults in their lives stood back and did nothing to stop it. Regardless of the validity of their concerns, they need to learn to express them in a fair and respectful way. When you told them your step kids weren\u2019t home when you went to the water park, that should have changed the subject.", "NTA. Your ILs were out of line.", "You are absolutely NTA. But your in laws are. They are poking their noses into a situation that has nothing to do with them. You were just simply replacing your son\u2019s best friend\u2019s parents. It was a day out that was planned for them as friends, not the whole family. You even ran it by your husband. And he was fine with it. \n\nMaybe if your husband or his ex wife had a problem, there would have been a further discussion. But this is the grandparents. And realistically, they don\u2019t get a say in how their grandkids are raised. \n\nIs this the first time the grandparents have acted like this?", "NTA \n\nYou both an to be parenting fairly.

This is literally the best way to handle a situation like this.\n\nOn the matter of IL. I believe they are upset over how \u201cthe usurper\u201d step-parent is treating their precious grandkids. There can also be an assumption on their side about how \u201ca family must do everything together\u201d. Overall, IL are taking the offense to a non-offensive situation. I would like to ask, is this the first time they are trying to throw their authority around, or is this a pattern of behavior?", "NTA they need to learn to mind their own business! Completely out of line for them to say anything to you", "Nta. \n\nDoes your sons life have to stop every time his step siblings are out of the house?", "NTA\n\nYou don't put your son's life on hold while your step kids spend time with their mom.

You are entitled to a life of adventures with your son.  You did nothing wrong.\n\nYour husband gave them too much information.  it is none of their business if you are at a water park with your son.  He should have said you are out.    \n\n\ntell your husband, from now on, it is his responsibility to communicate with his parents.  You will not tolerate being disrespected by them and you will No longer respond to texts and calls from them (change the ringtone on their nbrs to silent, when you see that they have called or texted, tell your husband and don\u2019t respond from your phone).  Also, do NOT let them into your house when your husband is not home.  They intentionally ambushed you when your husband wasn\u2019t home.  This stops now.

Your son deserves your attention as well.  It would evolve into a shitty relationship if he felt like he was always being lumped in with the other kids. He deserves to have time with you just like the other kids get to have time with their mom.", "NTA. I'm glad your husband has your back.", "There is no instead here, you just took your son and his bestfriend to the waterpark. That doesn't stop you for doing things with your step kids. You don't have to include everyone in everything. You in-laws are annoying. NTA", "NTA, do you have to put your live on hold while his kids are at their mom!? No. They are also doing fun things without your son, that is just how it works and they are all old enough to understand. Happy to hear your husband's got your back", "Your ILs are way out of line. You did nothing wrong. \n\nNTA", "NTA Why is your life supposed to stop if the step kids aren't there? You and your son are absolutely allowed to have lives and exist without them.

How dare they treat you like that and shame you for being a parent to your child. You are not a full time mom to your step kids.
