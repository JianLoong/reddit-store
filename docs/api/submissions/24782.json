The reason I am worried I might have done the wrong thing here is things are already unsettled among my son and them and perhaps it was wrong to go without them. Waiting a few extra days would have meant they would be with my husband and I and could have joined in.

Considering how your husband reacted about it, that should be a green light (within reason) to allow your son to have a fun day, with his best friend, without fear of being left out.\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nI take my biological children to do things separately all the time when one is at their other parents house.", "NTA. If the ILs feel so strongly about it, they\u2019re welcome to buy more tickets. It\u2019s not like you intentionally went without the other kids, they were with their mom. Your husband has your back, he\u2019s a good one!", "NTA: it's not even an issue of stepkids, my wife and I have 2 daughters and we will sometimes separate to do other things, especially if a friend is involved.  You're not always going to drag the other kid around when their sibling is playing with a friend. Not everything is going to match up at the same time for everything done for the kids, you just try to make things equal when you can.", "NTA. You husband needs to put your IL\u2019s rightfully in their place. It\u2019s none of their business, and it\u2019s not logically reasonable to expect that all the children be included in everything, every time. Even with my 2 siblings, between 10-18yo we had lots of activities every weekend. If we would wait for everyone to be free to do an activity, we would have missed out on a lot", "NTA.  Your ILs can take them to the water park then.", "NTA.  ILs need to mind their own damn business.  Good for your husband for having your back.  You just stepped to keep a planned trip from cancelling.  What was the difference if the original parents took your son?  He still would have gone to the water park without his step sibs.  ILs need to find something better to do with their time beside stick their noses where it doesn't belong.", "NTA. It wasn't like you took your son and excluded them by leaving them at home alone. They're just being pissy for no reason.", "Seriously? Don't you know that as soon as you became a stepmom you're not allowed to do anything at all except breathe when your step kids aren't around? NTA and your in-laws have lost their ever loving minds. Bet you anything they do \"something special\" for their grandkids because you left them out! Even though they wouldn't even know you went, grandparents are going to \"make this up to them\" somehow. Guaranteed. They will be the ones putting a rift through your family.... if you allow it.", "NTA. and How fuckin dare they.", "NtaJust like your husband says you have every right to do stuff with your son without his kids. \n\nHis kids do fun stuff with their mom and you should do fun stuff with your son too. \n\nPlus you went on a day you didn't have the kids. Im Sure they were having fun in whatever fun stuff they were doing with their mom.", "NTA, and your husband gets good marks for having your back.\n         \nHis parents just like to cause trouble.", "So your son is  supposed to sit in the house bored until the \"deserving kids\" show up for fun? These IL's of yours are bonkers.", "The IL's suck, a lot.  It's none of their business what you do with your son and his friend.  NTAH.", "Nta because you can't pause your life and your son's life while the step kids are away with their mum. \n\nAlso as the kids don't get along, why make them more miserable by making them having to share every experience together.", "NTA It was a trip your son had planned with his friend. I don't see why he can't do something like that with a friend. Not everything has to be a family affair.", "The idea OP's son can only have fun when the step kids are around is ridiculous.", "NTA. Those people would never come to my house again and me and my son would never go to theirs.", "You know they need to stick their nose not in your business\u2026 NTA", "NTA. They can take their grandkids to the water park themselves if they want them to go so bad. I\u2019m happy that your husband has your back!", "Send them a short winded message on how they should spend more energy staying out of your decisions.", "You are NTA. They seriously need to mind only the business that concerns them.", "NTA\n\nConsider blocking nosy grandparents. And great that your husband stands up for you.", "INFO: Does your husband's parents treat your son EXACTLY the same as their bio grandkids?", "NTA", "NTA. Your kids should not have to wait for other kids.", "NTA. They should not meddle", "NTA.  What a crock!  Even if all your kids were biologically yours, not every child in a family has to be glued to the hip of every other.  If you want to get the inlaws off your back, offer to let Caelen stay home while you take the step kids on an outing - particularly if it's something he wouldn't enjoy as much.  He might appreciate the chance to just hang out at home on his own while you \"make things even.\"", "There\u2019s a range of different workable stepchild/stepparent relationships, and the stepparent\u2019s emotional connection might never be the same to their biological child(ren), but in terms of how you treat kids in a blended family it should be fairly similar. Presents, financial support, extracurriculars, gifts, opportunities like vacations and outings, etc. should be roughly equal.", ">They said as a stepmom I should be prioritizing including everyone, no matter what it takes to do so.\n\nMy husband asked them to leave and they sent me a long winded message afterward saying I should work on being a better stepmom and that I was very wrong to do what I did.\n\nYou should have kicked them out. They can go worship their grandchildren on their own time and dime. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nEven full blood siblings do things with their friends without eachother, while still doing things together sometimes.  It's not uncommon for them not to have the same friend group, and perfectly healthy if they don't.", "No. Your in-laws are the assholes. They don\u2019t get a vote on this. None of their business.", "NTA\n\n1) Glad your husband has your back on this!\n\n2) Your in-laws provided their opinion; nothing says to have to take it.  They're welcome to pound sand.", "NTA. Come on, you must know they are.", "NTA\n\nAnd give your husband an appropriate hero reward for having your back.", "NTA.  They are not there every day, some activities are done altogether and some activities are not.  What a ridiculous place for them to stick their noses.  Sometimes my sister would be at camp, so m6 Dad would take me to Marineland, or my sister would have parent teacher conference half day and she would go to the museum with my Dad.  It happens sometimes.", "NTA. They need to mind their own business. Honestly, put boundaries in place and make it known They need to keep their opinions to themselves. Your family dynamics are not up for discussion.", "NTA. Your husband is right !", "NTA\n\nIf you made a deliberate practice of doing special, fun stuff on the mother's weekend...that would be an asshole move.\n\nBut an occasional thing is fine. I'm sure the kids do things with their mother that don't include your son.", "NTA. Your in laws need to mind their business. Maybe they can invest their energy in developing kinder grandchildren.", "This.     \nNTA", "Why on earth would she rub it in? What they don\u2019t know doesn\u2019t hurt them.", "NTA. Even if they were all your own children, it\u2019s still fine to have one-on-one outings or special days where it\u2019s just about the one kid and their friends. As long as it\u2019s not an all-the-time thing, there\u2019s nothing wrong with doing different things with different kids everyone now and then. Particularly when they have other plans or are elsewhere.", "Your husband sounds great and you sound like a loving and compassionate mom.  Good for you standing up for your son.  Sometimes in blended families one or more children are over looked and forgotten.  Sounds like, other than your in laws, you and your husband have a good system to make sure all children are well cared for.  Good job mom \ud83d\udc4f", "From now on I'll use \"Uno reverse them\" for this way of calling out on bullshit \ud83d\ude05\n\nAnd NTA", "That's what I'm asking", "I LOVE HOW YOUR HUSBAND HAD YOUR BACK. HELL YEAH! NTA though. You\u2019re amazing and if that were me I wouldn\u2019t wait for the other kids tf. They\u2019re over at their mums having fun. So why can\u2019t my kid have fun?", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA. Your in-laws need to wind their necks in.", "Hahahaha. I heard it somewhere on Reddit, and claimed it too."]}
