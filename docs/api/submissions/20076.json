While I got a decent amount of custody (two weekends and one school week, so about 9 days a month), I'm not allowed to see or even talk to Jackson when Paige has custody.

I've always had a good relationship with my ex-MIL, and she's actually been rather sympathetic to me throughout this whole thing; she even admits that Paige has been handing the whole thing rather poorly. So I ask MIL if me and Jasmine can take Jackson out, just for a couple hours before we give him back, and she gladly lets us. Me and Jasmine then took Jackson out to see the Spiderverse movie because I know he loves Spider-Man, then I got him ice cream and took him back to MIL's place after a couple hours.
