Because the real problem is whether or not you're gonna be up shit creek without a paddle when your ex takes you to court. And we can't tell you that.", "Info: what did your lawyer say before you did this? Did you call MIL, or did you just show up and put her in a difficult position?\n\nWhat you want in the future is \"right of first refusal\" so you can take your son whenever he's not it your ex's custody.", "ESH\n\nI feel like there may be information missing.\n\n>I'm not allowed to see or even talk to Jackson when Paige has custody. \n\nThis seems very unusual, unless there are some extenuating circumstances OP is omitting.   If it is in the child's best interest, the jusge would usually favor a liberal custody agreement.\n\n>So I ask MIL if me and Jasmine can take Jackson out, just for a couple hours before we give him back, and she gladly lets us. \n\nSo, knowing that you have a legal agreement that stipulates otherwise, you went behind your ex's back and appealed to your ex MIL\n\n>Eventually Paige finds out about this and calls me screaming at me for \"defying\" her and snickers to me that she'll be telling the judge about this. I argue that since Jackson was in her mother's care, she was the one who was responsible for making decisions about him while he was with her...\n\nFine, if you believe you did nothing wrong, you should agree to whatever judgment comes up in court.\n\n>and tell her to stop using Jackson as a weapon.\n\nPerhaps she is, but this is something you should bring up through the courts, not by going around the legal agreement\n\n>MIL says she'll go to bat for me but I really think I might've screwed up here.\n\nIf ex MIL will vouch for your character, why didnt you just ask her to do so in the first place?   Now you are not going into court as a caring dad who wants to challenge the custody agreement, you are going in as someone who broke the rules.   Surely, you can see that you've mishandled this whole thing.", "Stop posting on Reddit. Go get a divorce attorney right now. NTA but you're stupid to be looking for help from strangers on the internet.", "NTA, your ex needs to chill. It's not like you kidnapped the kid and went on a world tour.", "You did not screw up- get an attorney and fight for your rights. NTA", "You need to speak to a lawyer as what is happening is parental alienation. I cannot fathom what kind of messed up judge approved your current custody arrangement which seems very one-sided and unfair.\n\nGet everything in writing, including if you can your ex wife making these kinds of threats. I'd suggest a polite and as friendly as you can make it email expressing your thoughts/side of the story and see if she's dumb enough to respond with the same kind of manipulative b.s.", "NTA for seeing your kid. \n\nAlso, please get a lawyer. This is not something that even remotely needs to be in this sub. This is a legal issue. \n\nAnd for everyone saying \u201cy t a you\u2019re lying, the judge makes the best decision for the kid\u201d you are horribly naive. I have watched the way courts handle custody up close and personal. A good amount of judges still abide by the \u201cmother is best\u201d ideology unless there\u2019s clear and present danger to the child from the mother. So yeah. Definitely get a lawyer, OP.", "[removed]", "Yep, because exs using their kids as weapons is very common. And it's absolutely abhorrent", "This whole post sounds really fishy to me tbh. No judge would allow such a clause just because. Either Op didn't really fight for custody or there is something he is not telling us.", "Oh idk about that. My ex is a narcissistic butthole who went out of his way almost every single time to act outside of defined custodial agreements even temporary agreements put in place by the guardian ad litem that had to be appointed because he was such an asshole. My son had emotional and medical requirements at that were clearly defined and not respected by his father which caused more issues than my guts want to revisit thinking about. It\u2019s not always because innocent Dad just wants to be a dad and spend more time with his children. Sometimes it\u2019s purposeful sabotage and an illustration that he can defy court orders AND get away with it. This AH knew his ex was gone but I bet he could\u2019ve called HER to ask if it was ok first.", "If it's the order that doesn't allow him to have fathers day, then it's not her thinking she gets sole decision making authority. The court decided that. She's just following the court order.", "It\u2019s not parental alienation if he is the one who is defying orders. He may have a repeated history of doing this. We don\u2019t know. Mom might\u2019ve had her fill of his shenanigans.", "I am unaware of a state in the US that would allow such a thing in a custody order. \n\nNot in the terms you've explained it in, anyway. \n\nYour custody order is either really bizarre, or there are details you are leaving out.", "Get a better attorney.  THIS is 100% unacceptable.", "No it can't. The father of the child had permission from the grandma who was responsible at the time for the child. No body would call that kidnapping", "That's when you take it to the judge.", "You didn't have to get her to agree with anything. The court would have decided if the two of you couldn't come to an agreement on your own.", "Why is this downvoted please", "How are you covered legally though? You said in one comment that your ex MIL has 'custody' if your ex is incapacitated or out and then elsewhere that your decree covers right of first refusal. \n\nThose two things are not legally compatible. They would void each other out. Either your decree is a hot mess of garbage nonsense of you aren't telling the whole story here.", "So this was retaliation for something you think she's doing but don't have any proof of. \n\nOk....\n\nI wouldn't have put that in writing on the internet, but that's just me.", "Which isn't correct. \n\nRight of first refusal has a process. If your ex violated the process, then you file for a show cause hearing, not show up at the babysitter's house and take your kid. You still violated the order, then, and a lot of judges would look at it like both of you violated the order and just negate it out. Worst case scenario, you get slapped with a contempt order and fine, and your current processing goes against you because of that. \n\nYou need a new lawyer.", "Well the legal standard for modification is \u201cbest interest of the child.\u201d What your ex was doing was clearly not in the child\u2019s best interest so a modification was definitely warranted. I think OPs ex will be hard pressed to explain how taking the kid to Spider-Man and ice cream while she was out of town is so detrimental to his well being to justify taking his father out of his life. (For better or worse, the presumption is made in favor of the notion that having two loving/competent parents in the child\u2019s life is preferable to just one)", "Yes. Because the order is the only thing that matters. \ud83d\ude44She could\u2019ve been a normal human being and let her kid spend time with their father on Father\u2019s Day while she was on a girls trip. She\u2019s using her child as a weapon as most of these miserable, bitter women do. \n\nThe CHILD is who matters. Neither of the adults matter. She had her mother watch her child instead of the child\u2019s father. That\u2019s dumb when the father wants to be involved. The woman is mad the father no longer wants to be with her and is punishing him. It\u2019s sadly way too common.", "Parental alienation is when one parent attempts to remove the other parent from the child\u2019s life either by denying reasonable access or badmouthing them in front of the child. Both seem to be happening in this case.", "A 45 min drive is not far. You\u2019re being ridiculous.", "This is a ridiculous take.", "Because it sounds like bullshit.  This isn't how custody works, so either OP is making this up for internet points or he's leaving out massive parts of the story.", "Profound incorrectness. He didn't need to settle for what she would agree with. A judge should have decided what was fair if they disagreed.", "> My lawyer's told me that I'm legally in the clear, as there is a right of first refusal clause in the custody agreement. \n\nNope, his ex broke the agreement not OP.", "Following a court order does not make someone bitter and it is the opposite of using the child as a weapon. \n\nAnd there is obviously something very fishy about OP's story here so for all we know, there is good reason for the order to be the way that it is. If it even is written that way. Honestly, the stuff he's saying is so legally bizarre its impossible to tell what the real situation is.", "IF the story is exactly as presented, you are correct.  \n\n\nBut let's be clear here - this is a guy who considers nine days a month a 'win' in his custody arrangement. A guy who took up with the new lady four months after SEPARATING from his wife - not divorced. A guy who has lived with this for FIVE YEARS ... whose child literally does not remember living with his father, and who has had nine days a month with that parent for his entire memory.   \n\n\nThere is ABSOLUTELY more going on here than we're hearing.", "If that's what really happened.....", "Im not the actual judge. I didnt decide this.", "I am not an expert with custody law but it seems that the ex wife didn't do anything wrong. She doesn't have to tell OP what she is doing when it's HER custodial time with the child. (even if she was out of town with friends). She covered childcare for that time and didn't need OP to take care of the son. Just like OP wouldn't like it if the ex did the same thing. OP should have fought for a different custody agreement in the beginning. And there's still hope that the courts modify this setup as this must not be good for the child. Hopefully they'll get to resolve it.", "Then take it to the judge. Paige's lawyer doesn't have to agree", "No, that was not the only alternative. Your lawyer is shit. Do yourself a favor and get a new one.", "No, that wasn't the alternative. That was a possibility, but absent any abuse on your part or something like a massive cocaine addiction, it would have been very very unlikely to end in you losing all custody.", "As sad as it is a third of a month is definitely a win for a father. Most custody arrangements I know the dad sees them every other weekend and that's it.", "Yeah, you\u2019re wrong about that. Right of first refusal means if you need childcare you have to ask the other parent first before getting someone else.", "Yeah 50/50 custody is pretty rare especially when one parent lives far away from the other as in OPs case. That would be disruptive to the child in terms of school and community. 9 days a month is actually pretty decent for a non-custodial parent.", "Yeah supervised visitation would probably be implemented instead of this weird communication ban. What would be the point of that if the kid is going to live with him 1/3 of the month anyway? It would actually disrupt the fathers ability to parent, because he wouldn\u2019t be able to effectively handle the logistics of the kids life or stay up to date on the issues that he will need to know about when the kid is in his care.", "if i remember it correctly, OP said that the MIL was on the court ordered custody agreement as the 2nd person on the chain of custody. But i might be wrong about that. Regardless i think OP should have contacted the ex FIRST to let her know about his plans. Don't you think? Hopefully they can modify the custody agreement where these type of incidents don't happen.", "Wait, you're in a custody proceeding and violated the order?? Dude. Not smart.", "I sent you the quote where OP specifically says his lawyer told him he has right to first refusal. OP said his MIL has the right to make decisions if his ex is incapacitated or not there. That\u2019s a different clause than right to first refusal.\n\nETA they would not need to modify the custody agreement for this situation if she had followed the rules and asked OP if he wanted the time with his son before she left town.", "also- why is he just now appealing if this was settled 5 years ago??"]}
