Sucks he had to fight so hard, but he sounds like a good dad.", "\u201c79.9% of custodial parents in the United States were mothers.\n(US Census Bureau)\n\nOut of every five custodial parents in the United States, about four were mothers, according to the US Census Bureau child custody statistics from 2018. It\u2019s a slight decline compared to 2014, when 82.5% (five out of every six) of custodial parents were mothers.\n\nTherefore, it\u2019s slowly becoming more likely for custodial parents to be fathers, especially compared to a few decades ago.\u201d\n\nhttps://legaljobs.io/blog/child-custody-statistics/", "I'm a lawyer who has studied these statistics for years. You are wrong and what's sad is that anyone who knows the actual stats instantly knows the mistake you made.\n\nYou are looking at stats for who has primary custody by gender. But of those stats, something like 80-90% of cases *are not decided in court.* That means the parents either came to an agreement outside of court or one parent just walked away and left the other parent holding the bag. Of the cases that go to court-i.e. the cases where a judge actually makes a decision on custody- men are statistically much more likely to win as much OR MORE custody time than what they ask for.", "That\u2019s not how it works.", "Yeah sounds like he had absolutely terrible representation if he agreed to this custody arrangement. It\u2019s important to acknowledge that child custody cannot be part of a separation agreement and are legally void if included.", "Why on earth did your lawyer think them winning full custody with no visitation rights was even a possibility?\n\nDoes she have 10x your income to buy more/better lawyers?\n\nMy friend couldn\u2019t even get that when she divorced her abusive ex who was incarcerated for dealing at the time.", "Im sure the family court judge is going to be a-okay with that explanation.", "If it was turned around and it was a father withholding the child from their mother on Mother\u2019s Day would your response be different?\n\nParents do not have to follow the custody order to the t. They can be flexible and allow the child to spend time with the other parent outside of the court ordered time. They are allowed to make outside arrangements. The order is to guarantee time to both parents. \n\nInflexibility looks bad. Refusing communication looks bad. None of this is very far fetched. It happens all the time. This woman clearly wants to hurt the father because they are no longer together and haven\u2019t been for 5 years. Most dads don\u2019t go back to court because it costs a ridiculous amount of money to fight and the courts generally side with mothers no matter how crazy they are. It\u2019s really sad. And it\u2019s sad all the people ridiculing this man for wanting to spend time with his child. Legally he is fine. The mother didn\u2019t even have the child. She was out of town.

If both parents ask for custody, it's usually what happens unless there's some really good reason why one is total slime or why dividing time that way is simply unworkable. In this case, the 45 minutes' distance is the reason it's considered unworkable, no doubt, but joint custody with equal or very nearly equal time is common when both parents live in the same town. My kids grew up with a 4 nights/3 nights division weekly, with a lot more holidays at their father's in order to even out the totals over the course of a year.
