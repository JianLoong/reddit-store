In 2020, she, her husband, and their four kids moved into a camper. They homeschool the kids, travel all over the US, etc. They come to visit for holidays but we don\u2019t see them besides that. My husband and I are the opposite. We have four kids, and live in a big, beautiful house in Colorado. \n\nSo the issue; My sister and her family came over for Thanksgiving and spent the night. My sisters\u2019 oldest (F13 and M13 twins) slept in my daughters and sons rooms with them. In the morning, my niece and my sister got into a big argument, with my niece being incredibly angry at her mother for making her live in a camper when she could have so much more space, not have to share so much with her brothers (they all sleep in the same area), and be able to have more clothes/friends/extracurricular activities. I asked what was going on and, according to my sister, this has been an argument for a while. (Money is not an issue, they had a house before and sold it for a massive amount of money, my sister has a trust fund and a job, she just likes living in a camper).\n\nAfter a brief conversation with my husband and my children, we offered (in private to my sister) to take my eldest niece in. We have extra guest rooms and could make one a bedroom for her, there are great schools in our area, we\u2019d pay for everything for her, etc. She instantly said no, that she knew what was best for her daughter, she would miss her siblings. We didn\u2019t mention it again.\n\nWell my youngest (F13) told her cousin about the offer. She was very happy, but angry that her mother hadn\u2019t brought it up to her. She told my sister that if she made her come live in the camper again, she\u2019d  never do anything her mother wanted, because it was unfair that her mother wasn\u2019t letting her have a true childhood. While I don\u2019t condone tantrums like that, I understood where she was coming from, and helped convince my sister. When her twin brother found out, he wanted to stay too. My sister asked him what she was supposed to do without them, how was she going to care for the younger siblings without them, talking about missing out on family trips, etc. But nephew didn\u2019t change his mind. We agreed to a trial period, three weeks, which ended three days ago. My sister came back, fully expecting her kids to want to come back with her, but they flat out refused to even get in the camper. \n\nMy sister is very angry. She said that I was supposed to make them want to live with her, and that I\u2019m a horrible sister for treating her like this. She said I should kick them out, I said no. She said that I\u2019m a massive asshole, and told her kids to not expect her to come back for them when they got tired of \u201cmaximalism\u201d. Now her kids are sad, but they still don\u2019t want to leave, and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ve ruined my relationship with my sister. AITA Reddit?\n\nEDIT; I have been told that the technical name of the vehicle I\u2019m referencing is a motorhome. It\u2019s one of those large, I don\u2019t know, house on wheels things. I thought they were called campers since that\u2019s what my sister always calls it.\n\nEDIT 2; someone in the comments mentioned I should add this here; \u201cWe have temporary guardianship signed by my sister. Her husband came over after they left, and we filled out the power of attorney forms, got the things we need to put them in school, etc, and he took them back and had her sign them so we should be all clear.

The first is that a lot of families that share this small of a space stay in one place, so the kids make neighborhood friends and likely go to school. They have a whole infrastructure outside of the tiny living space to rely on. For people that move around, it is usually a caravan lifestyle and they travel in communities, so again the kids - and adults- have a whole moving neighborhood to rely on. And of course, kids see what their peers have, and that does matter, and in this case, most people are not living the way your sister is with her kids. \n\nYour sister has created a lifestyle that isolates her children. It isn't just a small shared space, it is also being homeschooled and being on the move. They have no sense of permanency and that is bad. Camper life works for adults, or it works for communities. Small spaces work when kids have access to constant external stimulation- think NYC apartments where kids make friends in the building, the bodega guy keeps an eye the kids, they go to school where they make friends and have space to run. Your sister has given them no tools for success with the lifestyle she has chosen. \n\nAnd she expects the older kids to parent the younger ones. It is one thing to ask your kids to babysit on occasion, or walk the younger kids home from school, but she clearly expressed her dependence on them to raise her other children. And of course she does. She has kids living in a tiny space being homeschooled- she isn't driving around, setting up camp, getting her influencer photos, parenting 4 children, AND schooling the children- without help. And I assume someone has a job somewhere in there too. \n\nLet the kids stay with you, get them some therapy, and figure out ways to keep them connected to their siblings.", "NTA. You are doing the absolute best thing you can for your niece and nephew. As someone who was raised for a period of time by my own aunt years ago, I can quite honestly say it was the best thing that happened to me and from what you\u2019re saying I\u2019m willing to bet that your niece and nephew will have similar feelings. That does not stop them from loving their mom or having a good relationship with her. \n\nYou are not ruining their relationship with their mother, she is by expecting you to sabotage their trust in you so they\u2019ll go ruining back to her. The influencer lifestyle is often toxic especially to children. \n\nYour sister needs to understand her children are individuals with their own wants and needs and those do not align with her want of living in a camper van. This is certainly an instance where she needs to put her children first and accept that they need a different lifestyle than she and their younger siblings do. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t seem able to grasp that it\u2019s not her they they are rejecting; it\u2019s her lifestyle choice, a lifestyle choice that is not for everyone. She needs to respect their choices. If she continues to stubbornly refuse to do so she will end up alienating her children and it will be no body\u2019s fault but hers. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t even begin to touch on the possible Parentification of the two kids which is a form of child abuse. There is a massive difference between minding a younger sibling now and then or in the case of an emergency and been relied upon for child care, what you\u2019ve described sounds a lot like the latter. \n\nKeep doing what you\u2019ve been doing as you\u2019re being a great aunt and the benefit your niece and nephew will get from your treatment will far outweigh any damage your sister is inflicting on your relationship.", "I love staying in a camper\u2026 for a weekend.

One of their needs is for positive social interaction with people outside their family group.  It is how they start learning who they are, why they are here, and how to build long-term relationships.   Younger kids don't need that yet.  Their family group is enough. I think  there is an argument to be made that isolating your kids from the outside world by living like a nomad or homeschooling without homeschool associations is denying your children a chance to reach that developmental milestone.

So they probably weren't even anywhere near anyone they knew to help them in an IRL emergency.

It\u2019s a safe place for them to vent and learn tools for how to process everything emotionally. After what they have gone through, especially being left in charge for days with little ability to contact their parents or trust that a trusted adult can be there quickly if needed, they will need someone to help them navigate those feelings and how it has affected them. I can\u2019t imagine being 13 and in charge of younger siblings for days while moving place to place constantly and not being able to call my parents if something happened. What if one of the kids got hurt and the older kids didn\u2019t know what to do or how serious it may be? What if service was spotty and they struggled to contact 911 and couldn\u2019t reach their parents? What if they were far away from the nearest hospital and the time it took for an ambulance to reach them made a situation drastically worse, like if a kid had an allergic reaction that resulted in anaphylactic shock? Or what if that happened to the older siblings and the younger ones had no idea what to do? What if something happened that caused the motor home to not have power and the kids had to deal with that completely alone? What if one of the kids was lost and couldn\u2019t be found or find their way back to the motor home? Or got sick and they didn\u2019t have a way to go get the medicine needed or anything to help. What if one got sick and that caused the rest of them to become sick? How would two sick 13 year olds manage to care for the others for possibly several days when they aren\u2019t able to care for themself due to being ill?\n\nI can only imagine how scary that must have been for them even if they just saw it as normal. That must have caused so much anxiety for them. How old are the younger two? Is it possible that your sister and her husband are leaving them alone for their hiking trips once a month for a few days? How old were the twins when their parents began leaving them in charge of their younger sibling\u2019s care while they went on their hiking trips for 3-4 days?\n\nSituations like that can have serious, lasting side effects that may not be obvious. It may have caused distrust in adults that they should be able to trust, like parents, in a way that goes beyond not trusting them with secrets, but in ways where they don\u2019t feel like they can rely on their parents to be there when needed or even ask. They may feel they have to be overly independent and constantly be the care taker, like they have to solve everyone else\u2019s problems but can\u2019t ask for help with their own. Things like that can last a life time and potentially affect every part of their lives. Therapy seems like a really good idea, please take them to see someone. If they don\u2019t like one therapist then let them \u201cshop around\u201d and find one they are comfortable with seeing. Let them know they are seeing someone that can help them and has to keep their secrets unless it\u2019s something that could result in someone being hurt.\n\nI\u2019m also going to say that you need to make sure to keep their trust as well in a similar way that a therapist would. If they tell you something in confidence don\u2019t tell others unless you need to for safety reasons. If the girl twin gets her period help her with it of course, but keep it private so she can adjust to the change without feeling like you put her new experience on display. Not private in a shameful type of way, just in a way where it\u2019s her choice who knows or her choice in how you speak about it and who, ya know? If situations come up where you feel like you need to bring someone else in to it then discuss it with her first, tell her why you feel it\u2019s important to involve another, let her be involved and have some control. She has lived in a way where it\u2019s likely she hasn\u2019t been able to feel any kind of control over things in her life and that can definitely cause control issues, which is another reason therapy would be a good idea for the twins. They haven\u2019t had control over things, a choice in things for the most part and that can affect someone in major ways.\n\nYou are doing an amazing thing for them by taking them in, like I really hope you know that. You seem like you have such a kind, caring, generous heart. If I could give you a hug I would, you are helping them have a change in their life that they need. You are giving them a chance to be individuals, to put themselves first for a change. You gave them the chance to be kids, to have their own lives that are about becoming their own person rather than feeling like they are stuck and have to put their parents and younger siblings first. Hell, you have given them the ability to have an emotionally hard day that isn\u2019t on display for everyone else because they are able to have privacy now. Having a hard day and not being able to cry in private is so frustrating, shit like that can contribute to having trouble with regulating emotions and expressing them in healthy ways. Like kids who are yelled at for emotional reactions may end up having a very hard time expressing emotion and bottle things up. Expressing things and learning healthy ways to do that and process is so important and we learn that as kids, so being allowed to express emotions and having a person to trust with them for guidance matters so much.\n\nHell, I was yelled at for any emotional reaction growing up, whether I was upset about something that was related to friends/not a reaction to my parents. One strange way that affected me was that I had issues with breathing. At first I\u2019d have anxiety attacks and I\u2019d breathe loudly. I\u2019d get crap for breathing too loud, became self conscious over it, then my brother and mom would comment on my breathing more and more often. It got to the point that I began holding my breath to avoid comments about it. It went from a conscious effort to hold my breath to unconscious, I wouldn\u2019t notice that I was holding my breath. I had to relearn how to breathe. Things play out in ways you wouldn\u2019t expect, issues with breathing is just an example I can give from my life. A therapist I used to see helped me with learning how to breathe properly and how to be more conscious of when I stop in emotional moments. It has been helpful as well because being able to focus on breathing can be calming for me.\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s the end of my way too long wall of text.
