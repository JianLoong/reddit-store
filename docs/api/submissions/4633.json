In 2020, she, her husband, and their four kids moved into a camper. They homeschool the kids, travel all over the US, etc. They come to visit for holidays but we don\u2019t see them besides that. My husband and I are the opposite. We have four kids, and live in a big, beautiful house in Colorado. \n\nSo the issue; My sister and her family came over for Thanksgiving and spent the night. My sisters\u2019 oldest (F13 and M13 twins) slept in my daughters and sons rooms with them. In the morning, my niece and my sister got into a big argument, with my niece being incredibly angry at her mother for making her live in a camper when she could have so much more space, not have to share so much with her brothers (they all sleep in the same area), and be able to have more clothes/friends/extracurricular activities. I asked what was going on and, according to my sister, this has been an argument for a while. (Money is not an issue, they had a house before and sold it for a massive amount of money, my sister has a trust fund and a job, she just likes living in a camper).\n\nAfter a brief conversation with my husband and my children, we offered (in private to my sister) to take my eldest niece in. We have extra guest rooms and could make one a bedroom for her, there are great schools in our area, we\u2019d pay for everything for her, etc. She instantly said no, that she knew what was best for her daughter, she would miss her siblings. We didn\u2019t mention it again.\n\nWell my youngest (F13) told her cousin about the offer. She was very happy, but angry that her mother hadn\u2019t brought it up to her. She told my sister that if she made her come live in the camper again, she\u2019d  never do anything her mother wanted, because it was unfair that her mother wasn\u2019t letting her have a true childhood. While I don\u2019t condone tantrums like that, I understood where she was coming from, and helped convince my sister. When her twin brother found out, he wanted to stay too. My sister asked him what she was supposed to do without them, how was she going to care for the younger siblings without them, talking about missing out on family trips, etc. But nephew didn\u2019t change his mind. We agreed to a trial period, three weeks, which ended three days ago. My sister came back, fully expecting her kids to want to come back with her, but they flat out refused to even get in the camper. \n\nMy sister is very angry. She said that I was supposed to make them want to live with her, and that I\u2019m a horrible sister for treating her like this. She said I should kick them out, I said no. She said that I\u2019m a massive asshole, and told her kids to not expect her to come back for them when they got tired of \u201cmaximalism\u201d. Now her kids are sad, but they still don\u2019t want to leave, and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ve ruined my relationship with my sister.

They're in a half million dollar Class A. If the mom just wanted some one to take her kids, why was her first reaponse No? The offer wasn't made \"in private\" because she brought her own kids in on the discussion before bringing it to her sister.", "That is a serious false equivalency. By the sister's own admission she relies on them for childcare. By nature of living in a camper they don't get privacy or much room to breathe. I think offering an alternative was perfectly fine.", "So her motor home is worth a lot?  She made lots of cash by selling a house?  She has a \"trust fund\".  But you are putting down  the other sister because, in your words,  she is \"rich\" and \"snobby\"?  I guess parents who take living their \"dream life\" as the priority over their children's needs, all stick together!", "Offer to her sister.  Do you not see that issue?  From the OP and her comments it sounds like niece voiced displeasure with the motorhome, and OP actively made it so that she now has legal control over her niece telling her sister after the fact. That\u2019s messed up.  Now if that all happened AFTER the OP had conversations with her sister (not everyone else) I might change my mind.\n\nRelative or not you don\u2019t just go making legal arrangements and living arrangements for someone else\u2019s kid unless there is a serious issue going on.   Lack of space is not a serious issue.", "I can quite understand, regardless of size and luxury, why 13 year olds would not want to livelong term in this way. They are super self-conscious about their changing bodies, and are beginning to turn to their peer group for social validation. Also - everything about your parents starts to go BEC.", "You are the one calling the mom \"trailer trash\" so clearly you think money is an issue here. OP uses the term \"campervan\" to diminish the size of the accommodations. You are both deliberately twisting facts to meet your judgemental narrative. The children's needs were clearly being met. Teenagers' whims don't need to be catered to.", "This type of guardianship if you want to call it that, is not the same thing as \u201ctaking away custody.\u201d  This allows OP to enroll the kids in school, to take them to the doctor, etc. A cousin did that for another relative in my family when the mom was going through chemotherapy. It doesn\u2019t take away rights from the mother.", "That\u2019s what they call it"]}
