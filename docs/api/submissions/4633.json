In 2020, she, her husband, and their four kids moved into a camper. They homeschool the kids, travel all over the US, etc. They come to visit for holidays but we don\u2019t see them besides that. My husband and I are the opposite. We have four kids, and live in a big, beautiful house in Colorado. \n\nSo the issue; My sister and her family came over for Thanksgiving and spent the night. My sisters\u2019 oldest (F13 and M13 twins) slept in my daughters and sons rooms with them. In the morning, my niece and my sister got into a big argument, with my niece being incredibly angry at her mother for making her live in a camper when she could have so much more space, not have to share so much with her brothers (they all sleep in the same area), and be able to have more clothes/friends/extracurricular activities. I asked what was going on and, according to my sister, this has been an argument for a while. (Money is not an issue, they had a house before and sold it for a massive amount of money, my sister has a trust fund and a job, she just likes living in a camper).\n\nAfter a brief conversation with my husband and my children, we offered (in private to my sister) to take my eldest niece in. We have extra guest rooms and could make one a bedroom for her, there are great schools in our area, we\u2019d pay for everything for her, etc. She instantly said no, that she knew what was best for her daughter, she would miss her siblings. We didn\u2019t mention it again.\n\nWell my youngest (F13) told her cousin about the offer. She was very happy, but angry that her mother hadn\u2019t brought it up to her. She told my sister that if she made her come live in the camper again, she\u2019d  never do anything her mother wanted, because it was unfair that her mother wasn\u2019t letting her have a true childhood. While I don\u2019t condone tantrums like that, I understood where she was coming from, and helped convince my sister. When her twin brother found out, he wanted to stay too. My sister asked him what she was supposed to do without them, how was she going to care for the younger siblings without them, talking about missing out on family trips, etc. But nephew didn\u2019t change his mind. We agreed to a trial period, three weeks, which ended three days ago. My sister came back, fully expecting her kids to want to come back with her, but they flat out refused to even get in the camper. \n\nMy sister is very angry. She said that I was supposed to make them want to live with her, and that I\u2019m a horrible sister for treating her like this. She said I should kick them out, I said no. She said that I\u2019m a massive asshole, and told her kids to not expect her to come back for them when they got tired of \u201cmaximalism\u201d. Now her kids are sad, but they still don\u2019t want to leave, and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ve ruined my relationship with my sister.

You didn\u2019t ruin their relationship with their mother: she did.", "\u201cGlorified\u201d is the key word. \n\nI get it, it\u2019s a nice camper, but traveling all over the place and not having roots is basically one after effects of homelessness. \n\nI will go a step further and say it\u2019s a low key form of child abuse. \n\nThe kids are being denied structure and opportunities, like friends, sports and extracurricular activities. \n\nYou sister is a selfish person, she\u2019s putting he wants and needs over her children. Which is something a good parent never does.", "I can't believe she's not even questioning her lifestyle at this point.", "You are good sister, OP. Hopefully sooner than later your sis will see that HER vision isn't everyone else's.", "van is a converted van motorcoach is usually a drive able camper and a regular camper has a fifth wheel or gooseneck to be pulled by a truck its relevant because of the massive size a layout difference between all", "So you filed legal paperwork to take your niece away from her mom?", "Put yourself in the opposite position. Your daughter HATES being the only girl and hates her school. She LOVES the idea of being homeschooled and travelling. Your sister tells her kids that they want your daughter to live with them in the RV BEFORE talking to you. You say NO. Your niece tells your daughter and now you have a 13 year old girl SCREAMING that she will never listen to you again.", "Yeah there are a bunch of people calling for child services to get involved. Apparently the only way to raise children is in a big Colorado house. I have known happy families raising children in RVs, converted school buses, or sailboats. I knew a family who had their 3 children all sharing a single bedroom. The problem here isn't the space. The problem is a bratty teenager and an enabling aunt.", "Yes, good point. After her sister said NO, she didn't back her up and the screaming teenagers got their way.\n\nI wonder if the family lived in a small apartment instead and the teenagers wanted to live in the big Colorado house, if everyone would be as supportive. Referring to her sister as a wannabe influencer definitely comes across as an AH", "You needed to run the idea by your sister first. She is an adult and the MOTHER. You told your daughter first as a way to ensure your niece found out and the issue blew up. YTA", "You should have spoken to your sister first, and had some discussion about it. If she agreed then you talk to your own family before making a decision.  And if she didn't agree then the discussion stops right there.\n\nYou have really made a huge mistake here.", "Exactly, and while the house is big, they\u2019d still be sharing a lot with their cousins, and since I already have four kids, I wanted to make sure none of the kids would be upset by it. It\u2019s their home first, and if they hadn\u2019t wanted their cousins to live here, I wouldn\u2019t have made the offer. I don\u2019t think my daughter did it maliciously, she was just very excited about having another girl in the house (all my kids besides her are boys)", "Either way, the sister has the right to raise her kids how she wants.", "Ah I see what you mean, yes, i did \u201cpay him\u201d in LEGOs at the time.\n\nAnd my nephew is loving having brothers, they wanted to take him skiing but he doesn\u2019t know how, and since my oldest works for one of the resorts near us during his winter break, he got my nephew into skiing lessons so they can all go skiing together soon! It\u2019s very sweet.", "The twins definitely hated it, that\u2019s for sure. They\u2019re loving having extracurriculares, and actually having their own space. The girl cried in the first week because we bought her bath bombs and she got to take a bath instead of a shower. They miss their little siblings, but so far they\u2019re very anti-mom, which I get because, well, teenagers lol, but I\u2019m going to try to work on with them because she\u2019s still their mother.", "Ah, it\u2019s one of the big drivable ones!", "Her husband (nieces father) filed paperwork to give us the ability to handle any medical issues, school registration, and temporary legal guardianship over their daughter.", "Thirteen year olds scream. That\u2019s what they do. Their job is to argue with parents. I would\u2019ve sent her to her room to calm down, until she was able to form a coherent argument. We\u2019d have an actual conversation about it, and if it was truly something she wanted, I\u2019d allow her to try it for a summer when she didn\u2019t have school. If she still wanted it, we\u2019d try it for the fall, revisit in the winter, etc. \n\nBut also, I know my daughter. She would not be willing to give up her clothes, friends, horseback riding, sports, dancing, skiing, to go live in a house on wheels.", "\"Happy familys\"  Good for fuckin them.  But back to this situation (as opposed to some other family this post isn't about), these children are NOT happy, and their mother is not looking out for them.  She is selfishly prioritizing HER wants.", "So does calling a 40' class A motorhome a 'camper van'.", "You\u2019re right that I probably should\u2019ve told my sister first but, as I\u2019ve said in another comment, they were leaving by that afternoon and I wanted to make sure I made the offer before then and my family is my first priority so I wanted to make sure they were okay with it. \n\nAnd no, I did not tell my daughter so she\u2019d tell her cousin. I actually told her not to say anything about it until I\u2019d spoken to my sister about it.", "Nope. The only people who made mistakes are the sister and her husband for dragging their kids around in a camper.", "I suspect your daughter was so excited to have a 'sister' who is the same age as her so they can go to do girlie things together or go and do tomboy things together.\n\nMy first thought it was like a little kid who has gone with one parent to buy a gift for the other parent but they can't keep the secret as they are so excited - Daddy we bought you a gift, can't tell you as its a secret, we got you a jumper - sort of thing.", "OP my husbands family are g*psies. Like actually ethnically and culturally, not randos who think the nomad lifestyle is an aesthetic. His childhood was hard, he had no friends outside his cousins because they never stayed in one place long enough. He left the community when he was 16 and never went back. He didn\u2019t really start speaking to his family again until after we got married a few years ago. A nomadic lifestyle really sucks for a lot of kids and your sister should have thought of that before dragging them along. Yea it\u2019s fun when you\u2019re little but not so much as you get older", "They are anti mom because your sister is a selfish asshole, not because they are teenagers.", "If it looks like a bus or is over 25' long, it's a motorhome. A camper van is just that, a van. *Huge* difference.", "All this without speaking to your sister?", "It was a hypothetical trying to demonstrate how you undermined your sister and her husband's parenting. I am not surprised a snobby AH in her big Colorado house missed that.", "A teenager threw a fit and OP meddled. So any time a teenager isn't happy they should throw a tantrum and their whim indulged? There were 5 other people in the family making the situation work. OP decided to supersede the parenting of her sister and make the situation worse. Scream LOUDER and you can live with your rich aunt.", "Right?! She is trying to paint this picture of neglect and people are calling for child services to be involved. The family is driving around in a half million dollar tour bus.", "Agreed! I always think how unpleasant camper life must be for teenagers when you see these stories about families doing this.... it's fine for younger kids, but at 13, not so much. \n\nI would have been asking every aunt and uncle to stay with them. A room with a door to close and some friends... that's what teenagers want. \n\nI met some kids that did this before it was cool... the 90s version was an old school bus and more on the follow the dead or phish side of things... maybe a traveling hippie circus. Regardless, they didn't like it at all. \n\nHomeschooling, watching the younger kids, no long-term friendships... family time all the time. \n\nI really hope all of these \"camper life\" people have a plan and a willing relative like OP. These kids will be running away to stability if they can. \n\nCamping is only fun if you have a house to go back to. Minimalistic life is appealing if you have lived in a maximum life and chose to step away and simplify.", "I completely agree. They\u2019re already thick as thieves, they\u2019re doing horse back riding together and they never leave each-other alone. It\u2019s like they\u2019re the twins!", "Ah, sorry, I\u2019ve always heard them refer to it as the camper so that was the word I used. It is one of those larger bus like thing!", "He spoke to her, she had to sign it as well. She refuses to speak to me.", "I know it was a hypothetical. However, you demonstrated nothing, because unlike my sister, I would take my child\u2019s opinion into account. It\u2019s her life, I\u2019m here to guide her and support her.", "So you now have 13yr old triplets then?", "Yeah, that's a Class A motorhome, not a camper. They cost $100,000 or more and have all amenities like kitchen and bath.", "I can\u2019t imagine why?  Do you seriously not see the problem?  What if your daughter complained you didn\u2019t have a horse farm and your (pick a relative did) and that relative thought you were negligent for not living on a horse farm and arranged for your daughter to live with them.  How would you feel because that\u2019s the equivalent here.  \n\nNever mind this comment reeks of your sister doing something she\u2019s not okay with but it\u2019s cool because your shitty BIL is in your side.", "Bullshit if it came down to your parental rights.  \n\nYour children have more \u201cthings\u201d than your nieces and nephews.  That\u2019s the draw.", "Pretty much! Everything in the house is absolutely chaos now (we\u2019re moving furniture in the bedrooms around so the twins can get what they want) but it\u2019s going amazingly. There have been one or two arguments, but hey, they\u2019re teenagers so that\u2019s expected.", "They can cost a heck of a lot more than that!", "Yes, exactly like that! Sorry, I don\u2019t know much about the whole thing.", "A tenant on our property has one. He went whole hog and his cost a full quarter mill.", "Calling that rig a 'camper' is like calling your house a 'shack'."]}
