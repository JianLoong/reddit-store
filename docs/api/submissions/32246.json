Mind you i have a social bathroo m he can use instead of always entering the main while i'm there.

Some people share that space with their partner because it is something you\u2019re comfortable with doing. I\u2019m also used to leaving the door open if I\u2019m peeing with only immediate family around- like my mom or brother or grandmother. I don\u2019t feel uncomfortable.

On a serious note this: please think very thoroughly about moving in with this guy. He seems overly controlling and has no respect for your personal boundaries", "There is nothing about this that's acceptable or normal.\n\nI've been married for over 20 years. In all that time, my husband has never once entered the bathroom while I was using it. Never once. There has never been a need, nor has he ever invaded my personal space. He always respects my personal space.\n\nWhen I address my concerns with my husband, over anything, he does not tell me I'm too sensitive, or I'm a prude, he doesn't refuse to listen to me. Instead, he listens to what I say, and if he disagrees with me, he shares his point of view. However, in the end, even if he disagrees with my feelings, he understands that my feelings are valid, and he changes his behavior in order to make me comfortable. Because he loves me, and he doesn't want me to be anxious, distressed, or uncomfortable. And I do the same for him, because I love him.\n\nYour boyfriend is telling you and showing you that he does not care about your feelings.\n\nRight now, you are just dealing with a bathroom issue. And that's serious. But your boyfriend is telling you that if you are sick, chronically ill, if there's a more serious issue in your relationship, he will always put his feelings above your own because he does not respect you.\n\nI would not enter a lease with this person.", "When he pounds on the door i open it because he gets pissed and it's a hudge fight... i always tought it was something he grew up with and i hate fighting so i just leave the door unlock.", "I\u2019m guilty of this with my husband. I start a whole conversation with him and he tells me to come back when he isnt on the toilet. Like any normal person I leave him be.", "The sticker here is, maybe not? Maybe it's just this weird thing. She's mentioned the mother of bf entering and conversing with her as well, which is fuckin wild, but it sounds more like an instilled thing rather than necessarily a control/insecurity thing. \nA bit different, being a learned habit and not borne from necessarily a negative place, but still a deal breaker for me! Lol.", "Based on what you mentioned abt his mom, I\u2019ll agree that he grew up with it. But it\u2019s not healthy, OP. Maybe you need counseling or he needs a therapy. Idk for sure but you do know it has to stop at some point m, right?\n\nAnd next time, don\u2019t give in. If he argues with you right after, don\u2019t engage.", "In what world is banging on the door until it's opened not being controlling regardless of underlying reasons? (Also: yea, I did read the story before commenting and yes I owned up for the fact that I missed a detail, so cool it with the passive aggressive questions . I saw your comment before you deleted it.)"]}
