If i'm taking a shower he wants to join me and make out, even if i just have five minutes before running to work. If i'm in the toilet he walks in and starts to talk. The worst is taking a dump while i shower, he is neither quiet or light, so it is always noisy and stinky, and wanting to join me in the bathub afterwards! \nJust for you to have an idea, he used the toilet, we went for dinner with some friends the other night and when we arrived my house with them for some drinks the stench was so dominant they asked if a pipe burst. Mind you i have a social bathroo m he can use instead of always entering the main while i'm there. If i lock the door he just pounds on it until i open.\n\nI asked him several times not to enter the bathroom while i'm there, he says he'll try but he always done that (we went to his folks for lunch and his own mom entered the bathroom while i was in the toilet to ask how i wanted my stake and proceeded to talk to me for several minutes until i asked her to leave... the wc there has no lock).\n\nI could bear with it since we didn't live together but now we are thinking about moving in together.

Some people share that space with their partner because it is something you\u2019re comfortable with doing. I\u2019m also used to leaving the door open if I\u2019m peeing with only immediate family around- like my mom or brother or grandmother. I don\u2019t feel uncomfortable.

However, in the end, even if he disagrees with my feelings, he understands that my feelings are valid, and he changes his behavior in order to make me comfortable.
