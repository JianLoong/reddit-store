We divided chores and he is in charge of taking the trash out, which among other things involves putting the paper from the basket in the big paper trash bin we have outside. \n\nWhat happened; I have been looking for my computer for several days. Finally I asked him for help. He kindly was looking for it in the house. He asked me it I looked in the paper trash bin outside. I told him no as I would never put it there. It didn\u2019t occur to me it could be there. He looked there and it was indeed there. He must have thrown it there with the paper trash. I was very angry about that. He was angry at me and said I should be thankful for finding it for me. That next time he won\u2019t bother trying to find my stuff. \n\nMy computers display doesn\u2019t work anymore now. The fall in the bin and the moisture and being outside several days have damaged it. I will have to buy a new one and asked him to pay for the value of a similar computer (same build year). He will do so but said that it is not clear that this is because of the bin situation. I think it is because it was fine  before. He also says that I caused it myself because I tried switching on the computer immediately after. Which apparently is bad and that I should have known. I don\u2019t know much about computers, he does and was there when I tried to switch it on but did not try to stop me at all, so I think that is not fair. He has never apologized and says he is dissapointed in me. I think he is in the wrong.

But this is just weird.\n\n1. Why does he think it's appropriate to put your laptop in a basket where paper trash normally goes? Is he aware that the basket is primarily for trash?\n2. Why would he then be neglectful (or purposeful?) in throwing your laptop out along with paper? Is it not obvious that your laptop is at least 3 lbs? Is it not obvious that it's heavy enough to give him pause?\n3. Why would he deflect it on you for the display being damaged due to moisture? If he knew the risks of putting your laptop outside, then he should just admit that he screwed up.\n\nThis screams passive aggressiveness to me which makes him the asshole. But it's also on you for \"not arguing with it and just taking it out later.\" Where is the communication and agreement here?\n\nYou guys have a bigger problem than just this. Something is wrong.", "NTA. To reframe: he doesn't like you leaving your computer on the table, so he packs it up and puts it with the recycling. That passive aggressive move didn't make you stop so he *knowingly* threw your computer in the bin. Then he watched you look for it for a week (again, passive aggressive) until you specifically asked him for help. At which point he was able to tell you exactly where it was because, again, *he did this on purpose*. Then he blamed you for the damage because you didn't [checks notes] \"learn\" from his previous passive aggressive AH behaviour. *He's punishing you for his own actions*.\n\nThis is manipulative, abusive and gross. Throw him out the way he tried to throw out your computer.", "NTA but your husband is. It's probably a good idea to find a different place to store your computer when you're not using it", "NTA - divorce, babes. Divorce. \n\nIn all seriousness, there\u2019s SEVERAL red flags here. Was he seriously that negligent that he didn\u2019t notice what exactly he was placing in the bin?? Secondly, his earnest misrepresentation and subsequently blaming (you \u201ccaused\u201d the damage and the \u201cyou should have known\u201d) is a major problem that needs to be addressed. He can\u2019t even be bothered to respect your things (or your job, for that matter)", "NTA\n\nIs he passive aggressively destroying your stuff?  Is he completely incompetent and careless?\n\nWho cares, either way he\u2019s the asshole.  Damn right he\u2019s going to pay to replace the computer.  I hope you can rescue your data off it in its condition - he should pay for that too, if it\u2019s important to you.\n\nAlso, make it clear to him that he should never put your computer into that basket again.  I don\u2019t know why that was ever a thing, but it needs to stop after this.  If that makes using the table less convenient for him, tough.  He\u2019s just proven that his preferred solution is untenable.", "NTA.\n\nWhy would anybody thank somebody for throwing their laptop in the trash just cause they found it? It is obvious he did it and you are obviously not the asshole. Just for him to say to be ok with getting a new one? Ya'll are weird and there is obviously something wrong going on between you two but I'm no therapist so meh.", "NTA you need to get a divorce. Not only dose he not respect your things, he dose not respect you. He wanted to break your computer and tossed it out on purpose, then punished you when you reacted like anyone would react. For your sake, please look into co-dependency and narcissistic abuse. This is not normal.", "NTA \nIf it\u2019s just paper trash he knew it was in there. A laptop weighs a whole lot more than just paper trash", "NTA - There is no way he would have not heard the laptop falling into the bun, or at least felt a significant weight of it when doing so. He is also the one putting the laptop in the bin itself, if I read it right. Last, it's weird how he is kind of gaslighting you trying to put blame on you solely with the turning it on right away argument.", "NTA\n\nHe was passive-aggressively \"teaching you a lesson\" by throwing it out. You're not going to leave it on the table again, are you? He got what he wanted.", "NTA\n\nI'm baffled why anyone would do this? Is this computer-specific or does this control extend to other aspects of your life as well? \n\nWhy does he need to assert himself like this", "I really do not believe he threw it out in purpose. Also he sometimes puts other non-garbage stuff in the basket as well (also his own things) I agree it\u2019s a very bad storage place but not that malicious.", "NTA but I would be more concerned about the deeper issues going on here. IMO there is a zero percent chance he did not know he was throwing the laptop away when he emptied the paper trash. He has a history of passively aggressively putting it in there, and 'accidentally' throwing it away is the escalation tactic when the first thing didn't work to stop you leaving it on the table. That he casually suggested you look in the outside bin (when enough time had passed to ensure the laptop would be damaged) is the tell that he knew it was there the whole time.\n\nYou both seem to have problems communicating (your refusal to find somewhere else to store the laptop is also unreasonable) but this deliberate and frankly pretty sinister 'punishment' tactic from him is concerning.", "NTA and hello to all the red flags!!! \n\nSo he throws your laptop away because he doesn\u2019t like you working at a table? Nope! Not even a tiny bit okay. Don\u2019t care how you share the chores, doesn\u2019t mean he gets to throw away a laptop. Also, he knew it was there. A waste paper bin with just paper in it is not heavy, add a laptop and it\u2019s 100% noticeable. \n\nThis is not healthy. You should be able to work wherever you like in your home.", "NTA - You don't store it in the waste bin, and you don't take the trash out. That was all him.  He needs to pony up the cash for a new computer and let it help him to remember to keep his hands off what's not his.", "NTA. sis, he was angry at you over a fake grievance and he trashed your laptop, then gaslit about it. RUN.", "INFO: Has other stuff ended up going from the table to the paper trash to the bin before? If so, was any of it your husband's things?", "He's lying when he claims that you turning the computer on immediately somehow magically caused damage. He just doesn't want to admit fault and is hoping he can use your lack of knowledge about computers to his advantage.", "ESH. I would be frustrated if my husband left his computer out on the dining room table when he wasn\u2019t using it. I would worry about tripping over the cord, spilling food or drink on it. I would dislike having to move it to set, clear or clean the table. \n\nHowever, any adult should know that storing it in a trash receptacle is an accident waiting to happen. You should have stopped leaving your computer out when he told you it bothered him. He should have found someplace to move it to that\u2019s not a trash receptacle.", "Why haven't you ever said anything about him putting the computer in the trash before ?\n\nFor ESH.\n\nThis is just the tree that hides the forest of a lot of issues in your marriage.", "ESH.  Why the fuck does he put the computer on the trash bin?  What is going on with you that you did not bring this up immediately as soon as you saw he was doing this?

If yes, than I accept your belief. I do not like the blaming he's doing though. The same way that when you are in a car accident someone is at fault even if they didn't mean for it to happen, and are responsible for damages, he is responsible for what happened to your computer because he put it in the trash. Accidentally or not. \n\nHe owes you two apologies, one for throwing away your computer accidentally and one for blaming you.", "Yes if paper and carton boxes were already in there you probably don\u2019t hear it drop. Agree with your assessment.", "But he'd feel the weight of the basket. As by computer I think you mean a laptop and not a tablet, even the lightest ones are still a lot heavier than just paper. This doesn't add up, as I doubt you have a seriously expensive ultra light laptop (not a comment on your finances but more on the fact that you say you don't know much about computers...no one buys a computer that costs more than a month's salary for most people if they're not into technology). \n\nI think he broke it by mistake and now he's covering it by trying to shift the blame on you.

This won't get better, it will get worse. A lot worse. Hes very passive aggressive and I don't think he likes you. He might love you, but he is very resentful of you.", "NTA.\n\nRespectfully, your husband is full of shit. \n\n1. He stores things in a trash bin, which you have asked him to stop, even though you should not have to explain why that's a bad idea. So either he has a concerning lack of foresight, or he is intentionally putting your laptop at risk.\n\n2. He does not check said bin before dumping it, even knowing he often stores things in there. So either he has serious memory issues and needs to see a doctor, or he intentionally got rid of it. \n\n3. He blames you for breaking the computer out of ignorance after he **threw it away** and **left it outside for days**, then said nothing while you tried to fix it. So either he defaults to blaming you for things, or he is intentionally belittling you to absolve himself of blame. \n\nDo you see the problem here? In the best case, he's got such poor mental processing and memory that he needs to see a doctor, and resorts to blaming you for things he messed up out of habit or desperation. And in the worst case, he is intentionally getting rid of your things and trying to convince you it's your fault and that you're not as smart as him. **Neither of these options is remotely okay**. You don't deserve to be treated as an excuse, nor do you deserve to be attacked or put down because of his insecurities. He needs to do better, and if he can't or  won't, you need to find better for yourself.", "NTA. I do t believe for a second that he threw it out by accident, there\u2019s something else going on here.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu KNOW he did this on purpose.", "NTA\n\nHe moved your computer somewhere inappropriate like a recycling bin.\n\nHe then emptied the same bin (that he knowingly put a computer into) into the outside bin without having checked it had been found and removed (or that there were any other non-recyclable in the bin).\n\nIt seems to me that this one is entirely your husband's fault, so it is his responsibility to fix the situation and replace the computer.\n\nYou are perhaps responsible for continually winding up your husband leaving out a mess on the table, but that is a separate issue unrelated to him carelessly placing expensive electronics in inappropriate places. The two of you need to communicate and come up with an appropriate solution here that suits you both, rather than petty bickering.", "NTA. He's full of shit and owes you a laptop and an apology for throwing it out and breaking it.", "NTA. So do couple therapy there is something behind this. If he refuses well I hate to say it but his lack of accepting that he messed up and destroyed your property is a red flag. See how he essentially said it was your fault. He doesn't respect you or your stuff. Does he boundary stomp?\n\nIf he won't go to therapy, go yourself and work through some stuff. Get some help. See if there is some stuff you are letting pass for the sake of the relationship. \n\nLike truthfully your husband sounds like a Narcissist. Nothing is his fault, everything has to be done his way, everything is about him. But that could be the way the post is written. All in all he sounds like a pain to live with.", "Wtf.. he threw it in the paper bin and then threw the paper bin away and now wants a thank you?\n\nNTA.\n\nThat's why you never put valuables in anything you might throw away", "I agree with everything except 2. For example, I call my Microsoft Surface my laptop (although it\u2019s technically more of a tablet with a keyboard attached that can be taken off), and that\u2019s definitely light enough to not notice if it\u2019s mixed in with a bunch of papers. Depending on how much paper trash they have, it\u2019s entirely possible to not notice a light laptop in there. Which is just another reason why it\u2019s incredibly stupid to store non-trash in a designated trash space. \n\n(Personally, last week I felt super weird putting a bottle of cleaning fluid in my waste paper bin I\u2019d just emptied. And I only did that because of them needed to go back to the same room. Regularly putting non-trash somewhere where trash is supposed to go seems very strange to me.)", "In the book \"Why does he do that\" I remember it talking about abusers damaging other people's stuff.  But they never damage their own things.  Is he accidently putting his electronics and valuables in the trash?   No?  Then he probably did it on purpose.", "Lolololol had to say it with Adele's accent, hilarious", "I guarantee you he is not spending one minute thinking about you or your feelings. Now you\u2019re second guessing yourself, and he\u2019s hoping you\u2019ve learned your lesson. Which is do what he wants how he wants it, or life will be\u2026unpleasant.", "Is it really that incredulous ? I never ever considered he would do it on purpose. Still don\u2019t. Now I\u2019m questioning my sanity.", "Look, personally I think it was 100% intentional and he is lying through his teeth. But if it really wasn't on purpose, he is still repeatedly putting your laptop at risk, not doing his due diligence when completing his chores, and, worst of all, blaming you for his obvious negligence and incompetence. \n\nI would be concerned for his mental health if it were just the first two. But blaming you and belittling you for something that was **completely** his fault is a huge issue. He knows he messed up, but is choosing to say it was your fault for turning it on, call you ignorant for doing so despite saying nothing at the time, and demand your gratitude for his half assed attempt to fix a situation he caused. He is willing to hurt and confuse you in all these ways to just avoid taking any responsibility for his own actions. That's not how someone that genuinely cares for you would behave.", "I mean, have you tried putting something of that size and weight in your waste paper bin and lifting it? Scrap that, you have it back and while it\u2019s broken it\u2019s still the same size and weight it was, so try it with the exact computer. Lift the bin with just your regular waste paper/cardboard boxes, then add the computer and lift it again. Sure, paper *can* weigh a lot, but since you rarely throw a 500-sheet box away at once, the waste paper bin in a regular household is usually fairly light. \n\nYou\u2019re being manipulated by him. He\u2018s lying to make you doubt yourself (and do what he says)."]}
