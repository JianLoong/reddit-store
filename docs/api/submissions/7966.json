Why would he then be neglectful (or purposeful?) in throwing your laptop out along with paper? Is it not obvious that your laptop is at least 3 lbs? Is it not obvious that it's heavy enough to give him pause?\n3. Why would he deflect it on you for the display being damaged due to moisture? If he knew the risks of putting your laptop outside, then he should just admit that he screwed up.\n\nThis screams passive aggressiveness to me which makes him the asshole.

Something is wrong.", "NTA. To reframe: he doesn't like you leaving your computer on the table, so he packs it up and puts it with the recycling. That passive aggressive move didn't make you stop so he *knowingly* threw your computer in the bin. Then he watched you look for it for a week (again, passive aggressive) until you specifically asked him for help. At which point he was able to tell you exactly where it was because, again, *he did this on purpose*. Then he blamed you for the damage because you didn't [checks notes] \"learn\" from his previous passive aggressive AH behaviour. *He's punishing you for his own actions*.\n\nThis is manipulative, abusive and gross. Throw him out the way he tried to throw out your computer.", "NTA but your husband is.

Was he seriously that negligent that he didn\u2019t notice what exactly he was placing in the bin?? Secondly, his earnest misrepresentation and subsequently blaming (you \u201ccaused\u201d the damage and the \u201cyou should have known\u201d) is a major problem that needs to be addressed. He can\u2019t even be bothered to respect your things (or your job, for that matter)", "NTA\n\nIs he passive aggressively destroying your stuff?  Is he completely incompetent and careless?\n\nWho cares, either way he\u2019s the asshole.  Damn right he\u2019s going to pay to replace the computer.  I hope you can rescue your data off it in its condition - he should pay for that too, if it\u2019s important to you.\n\nAlso, make it clear to him that he should never put your computer into that basket again.  I don\u2019t know why that was ever a thing, but it needs to stop after this.  If that makes using the table less convenient for him, tough.  He\u2019s just proven that his preferred solution is untenable.", "NTA.\n\nWhy would anybody thank somebody for throwing their laptop in the trash just cause they found it?

Ya'll are weird and there is obviously something wrong going on between you two but I'm no therapist so meh.", "NTA you need to get a divorce. Not only dose he not respect your things, he dose not respect you. He wanted to break your computer and tossed it out on purpose, then punished you when you reacted like anyone would react. For your sake, please look into co-dependency and narcissistic abuse. This is not normal.", "NTA \nIf it\u2019s just paper trash he knew it was in there. A laptop weighs a whole lot more than just paper trash", "NTA - There is no way he would have not heard the laptop falling into the bun, or at least felt a significant weight of it when doing so. He is also the one putting the laptop in the bin itself, if I read it right. Last, it's weird how he is kind of gaslighting you trying to put blame on you solely with the turning it on right away argument.", "NTA\n\nHe was passive-aggressively \"teaching you a lesson\" by throwing it out. You're not going to leave it on the table again, are you? He got what he wanted.", "NTA\n\nI'm baffled why anyone would do this? Is this computer-specific or does this control extend to other aspects of your life as well? \n\nWhy does he need to assert himself like this", "I really do not believe he threw it out in purpose. Also he sometimes puts other non-garbage stuff in the basket as well (also his own things) I agree it\u2019s a very bad storage place but not that malicious.", "NTA but I would be more concerned about the deeper issues going on here. IMO there is a zero percent chance he did not know he was throwing the laptop away when he emptied the paper trash. He has a history of passively aggressively putting it in there, and 'accidentally' throwing it away is the escalation tactic when the first thing didn't work to stop you leaving it on the table. That he casually suggested you look in the outside bin (when enough time had passed to ensure the laptop would be damaged) is the tell that he knew it was there the whole time.\n\nYou both seem to have problems communicating (your refusal to find somewhere else to store the laptop is also unreasonable) but this deliberate and frankly pretty sinister 'punishment' tactic from him is concerning.", "NTA and hello to all the red flags!!! \n\nSo he throws your laptop away because he doesn\u2019t like you working at a table? Nope! Not even a tiny bit okay. Don\u2019t care how you share the chores, doesn\u2019t mean he gets to throw away a laptop. Also, he knew it was there. A waste paper bin with just paper in it is not heavy, add a laptop and it\u2019s 100% noticeable. \n\nThis is not healthy. You should be able to work wherever you like in your home.", "NTA - You don't store it in the waste bin, and you don't take the trash out. That was all him.  He needs to pony up the cash for a new computer and let it help him to remember to keep his hands off what's not his.", "NTA. sis, he was angry at you over a fake grievance and he trashed your laptop, then gaslit about it.

He stores things in a trash bin, which you have asked him to stop, even though you should not have to explain why that's a bad idea. So either he has a concerning lack of foresight, or he is intentionally putting your laptop at risk.\n\n2. He does not check said bin before dumping it, even knowing he often stores things in there.

He blames you for breaking the computer out of ignorance after he **threw it away** and **left it outside for days**, then said nothing while you tried to fix it. So either he defaults to blaming you for things, or he is intentionally belittling you to absolve himself of blame. \n\nDo you see the problem here? In the best case, he's got such poor mental processing and memory that he needs to see a doctor, and resorts to blaming you for things he messed up out of habit or desperation. And in the worst case, he is intentionally getting rid of your things and trying to convince you it's your fault and that you're not as smart as him. **Neither of these options is remotely okay**. You don't deserve to be treated as an excuse, nor do you deserve to be attacked or put down because of his insecurities.

Depending on how much paper trash they have, it\u2019s entirely possible to not notice a light laptop in there.

Not to mention all the data and files you might have lost from it being being damaged in the trash! Absolutely gross behaviour.", "He threw your computer away and has the gall to say he\u2019s disappointed in you? Sorry to break the news to you, but your husband is a dick. This is not the way people act towards those they love and cherish. It is how abusers act though. NTA but you should examine every other behaviour he does in a light of \u2018would I behave like this towards someone I love?\u2019 Ignore what he says, watch what he does.", "NTA. He put it there that's why he knew where it was. He ruined it out of pettiness and is asking for you to thank him? No honey no. No one puts their partner's bulky work equipment constantly in the bin \"by accident\" without being malicious.", "NTA; this feels like he did it on purpose to teach you a lesson about leaving stuff on the table", "INFO: you said he puts his own stuff in that basket. Has he ever thrown out any of his own things? Or anything else of yours that you're aware of?", "That seems really unbeliavable, surely he would notice that the basket is heavy because of the computer?", "NTA. You don't put not-trash in the trash. Your husband owes you a repair or a new computer.", "INFO: OP, how long have you been together with him?", "NTA but your husband is because 1. He\u2019s full of shit about you breaking it for trying to turn it on and 2. He knew that computer was in the bin and thought he was teaching you a lesson. If he doesn\u2019t buy a new computer for you , throw something of his away", "NTA but run now", "NTA how would he feel if you destroyed his stuff because you don\u2019t \u201clike\u201d where he put it? I mean, his toothbrush is sitting beside the sink. What a stupid place to store it. Obviously it belongs on the very edge of the toilet seat and it\u2019s his own fault if it falls in.", "NTA duuude, he threw out your computer on purpose because he doesn't like it on the dining room table. That's nuts.", "This situation is very dumb and the top comments are so extreme. Why does it matter if you thanked him or not. Nice of him to look for it but it ended up lost and damaged because of him. He agreed to replace the screen right? Can easily be solved by finding a better place to put the new computer. Looks like yall have a great cleaning system in place otherwise.", "Nta. Clearly tell your husband not to touch your computer again. It sounds intentional that he would place your electronics on top of trash. Doesn't matter that it's paper. Also, I can't fathom how he didn't notice that he was carrying a heavy laptop among light weight paper and he was quick to ask if you checked outside... In the the trash\n..... He knew exactly what he did and he gaslit you. I feel like there are some underlying things here and your husband may not be as good as you think", "Oh my god, I don\u2019t even know what to say. He is trying to gaslight you into thinking he did nothing wrong. NTA, but I don\u2019t think you should be with someone who \u201cpunishes you\u201d by throwing your expensive technology away when you do something he doesn\u2019t like.", "He did this on purpose.\n\nAlso, why is this \"paper basket\" even THERE, and why is anybody putting anything else in it (which apparently happens with some frequency)?\n\nNTA", "NTA. Why he's expecting being thanked for barely making up to his fuckup is beyond me.", "NTA.1. Who puts an electronic device in a trash bin to clean up? (Assholes, that's who). 2. Who TF doesn't realize the weight of the paper bin when tossing it?\n\nThis was purposeful. 100%. Me nor my husband touch each other's work laptops when cleaning up. You can lift it to clean underneath, but that's it. Not necessary.", "How could he not notice a computer falling out of a bin that normally only has paper?", "OP doesn't want to hear the truth, from the sound of it. This is deliberate abuse and sabotage of her work.", "Also to add - what other things does he try to control like this? This behavior is concerning on many levels and I doubt this is isolated. \n\nThis is not just passive aggressive, this is controlling behaviour. \n\nHim telling you you should thank him is borderline emotional abuse.", "I was thinking the same. Who would even have the thought that maybe this item is in the specific trash can if they didn\u2019t know all along that it was there? It\u2019s not adding up to me", "Right? \n\nMy husband has a lot of junk that I can't stand - its clutter to me. But I can't imagine just throwing it away. Its his stuff.\n\nFor OP's husband to think it is remotely okay to throw away a computer because he doesn't like where she put it.\n\nOP, how many other times has he thrown away your stuff? Manipulated you? Gas-lit you? Because I highly doubt the first time was with an expensive piece of equipment.\n\nI see this as the line in the sand for couples counseling or looking long and hard at the marriage. I would NOT get into a pissing match by throwing away something of value to him because he'll see that as a throw-down and escalate his behavior.", "My abusive ex-boss used to do things like this to me. He threw my keys into a wall and they fell behind an appliance and pretended he didn't know where they were. A new assistant had to privately tell me where to find them so I could go home. He also tried to crush my cell phone with his hand in a tantrum. The laptop was not an \"oops.\"", "He\u2019s not *failing* at something, he\u2019s actively moving and throwing something out. Weaponized incompetence is like burning dinner five times in a row so you don\u2019t have to cook", "You have no idea what weaponized incompetence means.", "What the fuck that\u2019s so weird", "I think it's really telling that your husband doesn't like you levning things on the dining table, whereas HE is free to place things in places where they absolutely never should be (expensive, important stuff in the same place where he keeps the garbage). What you do (leaving the laptop out) is normal. What he does (putting it in with the throw-away-paper) is very strange and makes no sense. Why use a trash bin as storage? It's like a highway to disaster. Why not use or buy a different bin for storage?", "I'd go with financial abuse too. He's taking away her ability to do her job.", "Jesus Christ. My boss tried to get me fired for not sleeping with him, but he never broke or hid my stuff. I actually *prefer* my bad boss.", "We have a paper bin as well and if my MacBook Air  2.75lbs falls in there, I would feel if when I lift it."]}
