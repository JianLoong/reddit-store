Why would he then be neglectful (or purposeful?) in throwing your laptop out along with paper? Is it not obvious that your laptop is at least 3 lbs? Is it not obvious that it's heavy enough to give him pause?\n3. Why would he deflect it on you for the display being damaged due to moisture? If he knew the risks of putting your laptop outside, then he should just admit that he screwed up.\n\nThis screams passive aggressiveness to me which makes him the asshole.

Something is wrong.", "NTA. To reframe: he doesn't like you leaving your computer on the table, so he packs it up and puts it with the recycling. That passive aggressive move didn't make you stop so he *knowingly* threw your computer in the bin. Then he watched you look for it for a week (again, passive aggressive) until you specifically asked him for help. At which point he was able to tell you exactly where it was because, again, *he did this on purpose*. Then he blamed you for the damage because you didn't [checks notes] \"learn\" from his previous passive aggressive AH behaviour. *He's punishing you for his own actions*.\n\nThis is manipulative, abusive and gross. Throw him out the way he tried to throw out your computer.", "NTA but your husband is. It's probably a good idea to find a different place to store your computer when you're not using it", "NTA - divorce, babes. Divorce. \n\nIn all seriousness, there\u2019s SEVERAL red flags here. Was he seriously that negligent that he didn\u2019t notice what exactly he was placing in the bin?? Secondly, his earnest misrepresentation and subsequently blaming (you \u201ccaused\u201d the damage and the \u201cyou should have known\u201d) is a major problem that needs to be addressed. He can\u2019t even be bothered to respect your things (or your job, for that matter)", "NTA\n\nIs he passive aggressively destroying your stuff?  Is he completely incompetent and careless?\n\nWho cares, either way he\u2019s the asshole.  Damn right he\u2019s going to pay to replace the computer.  I hope you can rescue your data off it in its condition - he should pay for that too, if it\u2019s important to you.\n\nAlso, make it clear to him that he should never put your computer into that basket again.  I don\u2019t know why that was ever a thing, but it needs to stop after this.  If that makes using the table less convenient for him, tough.  He\u2019s just proven that his preferred solution is untenable.", "NTA.\n\nWhy would anybody thank somebody for throwing their laptop in the trash just cause they found it?

Ya'll are weird and there is obviously something wrong going on between you two but I'm no therapist so meh.", "NTA you need to get a divorce. Not only dose he not respect your things, he dose not respect you. He wanted to break your computer and tossed it out on purpose, then punished you when you reacted like anyone would react. For your sake, please look into co-dependency and narcissistic abuse. This is not normal.", "NTA \nIf it\u2019s just paper trash he knew it was in there. A laptop weighs a whole lot more than just paper trash", "NTA - There is no way he would have not heard the laptop falling into the bun, or at least felt a significant weight of it when doing so. He is also the one putting the laptop in the bin itself, if I read it right. Last, it's weird how he is kind of gaslighting you trying to put blame on you solely with the turning it on right away argument.", "NTA\n\nHe was passive-aggressively \"teaching you a lesson\" by throwing it out. You're not going to leave it on the table again, are you? He got what he wanted.", "NTA\n\nI'm baffled why anyone would do this? Is this computer-specific or does this control extend to other aspects of your life as well? \n\nWhy does he need to assert himself like this", "I really do not believe he threw it out in purpose. Also he sometimes puts other non-garbage stuff in the basket as well (also his own things) I agree it\u2019s a very bad storage place but not that malicious.", "NTA but I would be more concerned about the deeper issues going on here. IMO there is a zero percent chance he did not know he was throwing the laptop away when he emptied the paper trash. He has a history of passively aggressively putting it in there, and 'accidentally' throwing it away is the escalation tactic when the first thing didn't work to stop you leaving it on the table. That he casually suggested you look in the outside bin (when enough time had passed to ensure the laptop would be damaged) is the tell that he knew it was there the whole time.\n\nYou both seem to have problems communicating (your refusal to find somewhere else to store the laptop is also unreasonable) but this deliberate and frankly pretty sinister 'punishment' tactic from him is concerning.", "NTA and hello to all the red flags!!! \n\nSo he throws your laptop away because he doesn\u2019t like you working at a table? Nope! Not even a tiny bit okay. Don\u2019t care how you share the chores, doesn\u2019t mean he gets to throw away a laptop. Also, he knew it was there. A waste paper bin with just paper in it is not heavy, add a laptop and it\u2019s 100% noticeable. \n\nThis is not healthy. You should be able to work wherever you like in your home.", "NTA - You don't store it in the waste bin, and you don't take the trash out. That was all him.  He needs to pony up the cash for a new computer and let it help him to remember to keep his hands off what's not his.", "NTA. sis, he was angry at you over a fake grievance and he trashed your laptop, then gaslit about it.

He stores things in a trash bin, which you have asked him to stop, even though you should not have to explain why that's a bad idea. So either he has a concerning lack of foresight, or he is intentionally putting your laptop at risk.\n\n2. He does not check said bin before dumping it, even knowing he often stores things in there. So either he has serious memory issues and needs to see a doctor, or he intentionally got rid of it. \n\n3. He blames you for breaking the computer out of ignorance after he **threw it away** and **left it outside for days**, then said nothing while you tried to fix it. So either he defaults to blaming you for things, or he is intentionally belittling you to absolve himself of blame. \n\nDo you see the problem here? In the best case, he's got such poor mental processing and memory that he needs to see a doctor, and resorts to blaming you for things he messed up out of habit or desperation. And in the worst case, he is intentionally getting rid of your things and trying to convince you it's your fault and that you're not as smart as him. **Neither of these options is remotely okay**. You don't deserve to be treated as an excuse, nor do you deserve to be attacked or put down because of his insecurities.

Depending on how much paper trash they have, it\u2019s entirely possible to not notice a light laptop in there.

Lift the bin with just your regular waste paper/cardboard boxes, then add the computer and lift it again.

NTA for not thanking someone for abusing you, wtf.  He probably knew it was there the whole time and enjoyed watching you look for it.", "Oh man. A new gen z phrase. I can't keep up. Someone in my own sub said I was gaslighting everyone bc I wrote \"Lions are sexy. Well, sexy isn't the right word. I'm not attracted to lions. I just think they're beautiful\". I know it sounds like a very strange comment out of context, but it was on-topic in a sub re: my unpopular username. I got attacked by a bunch of radical feminists & had someone reply with the dictionary definition of \"sexy\". I had to look up \"gaslight\" to ensure I was seriously being accused of such behavior in my own sub. I understand the term now. I know all the terms. *flips hair with unsure confidence* Quiz me! I know TERF, \"pick me\", THOT, and ummm all the other ones!!! jk, I use urban dictionary wayyyy too much. Thank you for explaining, PP.", "Your husband is abusive and your whole situation is scary.", "Girl, run and run far. This isn't normal behavior and if you're questioning your sanity, let me save you years of agony. It's not you, it's him. He is manipulating you it won't stop here.", "He also knew where it was."]}
