I can't stand people that think a person shouldn't give/get their kid certain things \"cause other kids don't have it\" or \"Joey's parents can't get him that so you shouldn't get it for you kid cause Joey will be sad\".... Nope!!! Get your kids the meals you want to buy them. If their cousin(s) can't handle it, that's on their parent(s).\n\nAll that said, I think it's more of an ah move to have a child birthday party and not provide any food..... At least should be providing snacks. I have NEVER been to a birthday party for a kid where there was no food.", "Who TF hosts a party and doesn't provide food? NTA just based off that. Hell, bring the best meal you can think of for your kids. And stick a toy in the bag. Steak, lobster, toy.", "? Any lunch you provide it acceptable at a 'bring your own lunch' party.

He can deal with it.", "NAH but you're probably going to start a minor riot among the kids", "NTA. The other kids may be jealous, but the other parents/ family members may judge depending on how they feel about fast food. But your sister was trying to save money by not providing food.

SIL had a christening and they didn't provide food or any kind of drink, not even water. People came from abroad, we had a 4 hour journey all for no food or drink. Cheapskates.

That wasn't the reason at my son's party for no cake! Was odd, they all got fed and little gift bags but, no cake! The cake was my sons favourite bit!! We got him a cupcake on the way home!"]}
