You can absolutely get a ring made in a plain version to coordinate to her set. \n\nYou should have proposed with a set from the shop your family uses if it was that important to you.

You intentionally got bands that did not match her engagement ring - why would you do that?  Her rings are worn on the same finger, so they're supposed to match.", "YTA. Why would you get custom rings made that don\u2019t match the engagement ring you had already given her, then refuse to wear a wedding band at all unless she\u2019s wearing the one that doesn\u2019t match *the ring YOU had already given her*? Is she supposed to wear mismatched jewelry every day for her entire life because you couldn\u2019t be bothered to show your jeweler what your matching set of bands needed to coordinate with?\n\nETA: My wife and I don\u2019t have matching rings at all. They\u2019re the same metal but that\u2019s as far as it goes. We each have a style that suits our personal taste and works for what we do on a daily basis. We realized quite quickly that we could either have non-matching rings we both *loved* or matching rings we both thought were *okay*, and that we\u2019ll ideally be wearing these every day for life so we should go with what we love. Our different rings styles don\u2019t make us any less married.

You said you see no point in wearing it if it isn\u2019t symbolic but it is symbolic. It symbolizes the lifetime commitment you made to your wife. It doesn\u2019t have to match her ring in order to carry that meaning. If you and your wife agreed to wear wedding rings, you need to wear yours.

I have not worn a ring in those 25 years and am rarely seen with any kind of jewelry. I don't really like how rings feel. Thing is, if either of them had asked me I wouldn't have thought twice about doing it and they would have done the same.\n\nYou seem to have no problem if they're matched but this is entirely not about what she's wearing but about what you are wearing.

But that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case here.", "Light YTA - because this is important to your wife, and one would hope you care about that. Wedding rings are all about symbolism, and it seems you did agree to wear one initially, just reneged because she wanted a different style than you had chosen for her. Why should that change anything? Pick a ring YOU like, it doesn't need to be a match for hers. Most couples I know don't have identical wedding bands, lots don't even have the same colour of metal.\n\nEdit to respond to your edits:\n\nNo, nobody \"dictates\" anything to anyone else. \n\nYour wife has chosen her ring, frankly it's creepy you would try to override her and insist she wears the one you chose just because you chose it. You're sounding controlling.\n\nNo, she can't force you to wear a ring either. The idea would be that you choose to do it because it's important to her as a public symbol of your union.", "Wow. You are biter and vengeful. YTA for that.", "YTA. Listen is this the hill you want to die on? Wear the ring. Who cares if it matches hers or not.
