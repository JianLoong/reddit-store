He grew up in a rural area (school system is not great) but in our decision making he expressed that the best thing would be to just stay in his home town because he will never sell his land. \nAfter a few odd things have been said by his family I started to question if he even owned this property. I\u2019ve seen his land taxes but when going over his credit and taxes there is nothing at all about his property in it. I asked him a few times about it and he acted so offended that i would even ask! \n\nI woke up this morning and couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that something was off. I called the county assessor and found out this is his uncles land and home (uncle is a widow and works out of the state). Basically for the last 6 months we\u2019ve been house sitting. The furniture and everything is his uncles! \n\nI confronted him today and honestly I\u2019m considering just leaving but at the VERY LEAST, I want us to move. We have the credit and the savings to buy a home but he won\u2019t budge and keeps saying his uncle will \u201cprobably\u201d give him the property. I feel like he manipulated me to move here.

It's not about you being a gold-digger, it's about his lying.  You guys were making future plans, and you didn't even really want to live out there....so it's not like you are with him for the house, right?   You need to step away and think things thru, go stay with your parents or good friend for a bit while you think it thru. Think about the fact that even not owning it - it's where he wants to stay, at 31 does he have a couch, a TV, anything to contribute to a home?  Or did he take advantage of the situation and smartly build up a nice nest egg or blow his income?  Is living where you are, with someone waiting to get stuff for free -- what you want for your future, for your kids? If you decide to walk away - what he or his friends think of you is not your problem - you do you.  If you decide this is fixable, then you might as well stay in the house and save as long as you can to buy what/where you want.

Why does your fianc\u00e9 think it\u2019s okay to tell such a huge lie? AND he continues to push the idea of living there when it\u2019s not even guaranteed he will ever own that property? What happens when is uncle wants to move back in? You\u2019ll be forced to leave and find a house when that could of been done already. That right there is enough for me to leave him.

Someday.\n\nYes, you were manipulated and then some! You were bamboozled into ranch-sitting (for free!), and giving up your apartment lease too, which sucks. Time to put an end to this mess.\n\nFind an affordable place in town, near your job and in a location that you like. Use YOUR credit to either rent or buy, in your own sole name. You're not a gold digger, but you are a realist: prove it to everyone and stake out your own space. \n\nFeel free to tell Fiance that he can have the country OR he can have you.

Glad you followed that gut instinct and found out the truth now.  That is a huge lie and not something to be overlooked.", "NTA the AH lied and manipulated you and is also talking shit about you to his best man (who is also an AH) dunno why you would consider staying with someone you 100% definitely can't trust and who also wants a different future from you.

He lies, and when asked outright uses anger and fear to try and keep you from pressing further. Then once his lies are discovered, he doesn\u2019t apologize.

It is a massive red flag that the person you are LIVING with is lying to you about something as major as whether or not he owns the place.

Honestly LEAVE THAT MAN. If he is willing to lie to you about something like this, I can't imagine what he would hide and manipulate you into in the future.", "NTA.

One that basically could inform decisions about careers and children and retirement.  What else is he lying about?  This is a huge deal! Don't let him minimize this, or his friend turn this around on you and make this about you being a gold digger.  Your bf is a boldfaced liar and manipulator.", "NTA. It sounds like he made up this story to avoid moving to where you wanted to live and raise a family, instead of talking to you like an adult.\n\nI don\u2019t like to jump in the leave him bandwagon, but if my partner did this to me, I\u2019d be out simply because it\u2019s not a little lie, it\u2019s a massive one that changes the whole future.

He will lie to you to get his way.  This is who he is.
