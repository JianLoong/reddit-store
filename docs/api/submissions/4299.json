He grew up in a rural area (school system is not great) but in our decision making he expressed that the best thing would be to just stay in his home town because he will never sell his land. \nAfter a few odd things have been said by his family I started to question if he even owned this property. I\u2019ve seen his land taxes but when going over his credit and taxes there is nothing at all about his property in it. I asked him a few times about it and he acted so offended that i would even ask! \n\nI woke up this morning and couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that something was off. I called the county assessor and found out this is his uncles land and home (uncle is a widow and works out of the state). Basically for the last 6 months we\u2019ve been house sitting. The furniture and everything is his uncles! \n\nI confronted him today and honestly I\u2019m considering just leaving but at the VERY LEAST, I want us to move. We have the credit and the savings to buy a home but he won\u2019t budge and keeps saying his uncle will \u201cprobably\u201d give him the property. I feel like he manipulated me to move here.

I decided last night that I am done. Especially since (like many predicted) I found out he\u2019d been lying about more than just this. \n\nI am calling today to cancel our venue (that\u2019s 4500 down the drain). \n\nAs far as the savings, I have proof that what I took is mine. It wasn\u2019t much but it\u2019s over 15k so I am confident that I can leave and have a good cushion. I have a year left of my masters program and I work a remote job with unlimited PTO. I\u2019m taking the day off to pack and my best friend and her boyfriend who is like a brother to me offered their guest room to me. I\u2019m going to stay there and continue saving while I look for my own property that\u2019s ACTUALLY mine. \n\nI hadn\u2019t done hardly any planning for our wedding which I blamed on school and work but now I know it was a subconscious choice. I also had a separate savings that I had started before we ever met in the event that I had to pay for my masters program (luckily my job is paying for that). \n\nI think that is what is most infuriating. Together (he also has a separate savings that doesn\u2019t have as much as mine but still) we have PLENTY of money in savings to buy land and build a home AND we are both debt free. But that is no longer an option for me. \nLast night he was begging to make it work. Started saying he would move wherever I wanted and was apologizing profusely. I made him call his friend on speaker to let him know that he has been living a lie and that I\u2019m leaving him. \n\nThank you all for your responses. I\u2019m meeting with my therapist this morning and my dad will be coming this evening to help me load up all of my things.\n\n(Edited typos)", "Starting a relationship on a lie is not good. Once a lier always a lier. I'd be questioning everything he said. NTA here.", "NTA\n\nGirl fuckin' run. This is not a small lie like \"oh my favourite colour isnt actually blue, it's orange\". No. It's the kind of lie where you have to completely reevaluate the person; and from what info you've given i wouldn't even trust lending him a pencil, nevermind considering marriage.\n\nAnd calling you a gold digger is beyond disrespectful. HE was the one trying to seem like a much more lucrative partner than he actually is.\n\nRed flags everywhere with this guy, please don't let yourself get fooled \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "nope, he's just a liar.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou have more than a location issues, you have a fiance issue.\n\nWhy are you considering starting a life with someone who lies about such an important matter, your housing. \n\nThink down the road....Is he actually making rent/house payments?

This is a HUGE breach of trust that you would be foolish to marry into without some major changes.\n\nDoes he actually still have his job?

Remember that liars never stop at one lie, they tell lie upon lie and their wives and kids have miserable lives. You can never ever trust him, you will never know who he really is, what he really thinks, what he really feels. Do not believe the, 'oh, you only care because you are a gold digger'.

I hope the only reason you're still there is from the shock of finding out the love of your life is a manipulative liar. You know there's no coming back from this.

If he can't be trusted to tell you the truth about something this big, then what do you expect when you get married? Small lies turn into big ones.  He is starting with big ones.  Where do you think this is going to go?\n\nSounds like he might think the only way he could keep you was to sell you this story, and once you bought into it, you wouldn't leave because you already made that purchase. \n\nWhose idea was it to get rid of your place?  Who started that conversation?", "NTA. If there were ever a time to just cut ties and move on, this is it. I don\u2019t think this is the type of thing to try to work through.

This was a huge lie.  He deliberately deceived you into thinking this was his land and his house.  His Uncle could kick both of you out at any time.

Nothing to do with money or being a \"gold digger\" - it has to do with not being able to trust your partner and that just doesn't work.", "NTA. What else has he or will he lie about?", "NTA, the fact that he lied to you is the big problem.

In the end, he repeatedly lied to you in order to manipulate you to his preference, despite knowing what you wanted for your life. You wouldn't have moved out there if he had told the truth.

If uncle does die and has no heirs or will it will go to his sibling and possibly parents and then they would all have to agree on selling or giving it to your fiance.
