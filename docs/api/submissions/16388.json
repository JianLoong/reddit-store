{"id": 16388, "submission_id": "137yeib", "title": "AITA for not wanting to pay for my friend's wedding after she uninvited me?", "selftext": "I (26F) have been friends with \"Sara\" (28F) since high school. We've been through a lot together and I've always considered her one of my closest friends.\n\nLast year, Sara got engaged to her long-term boyfriend and started planning her wedding. She asked me to be her maid of honor, which I was thrilled about. I helped her with everything from dress shopping to DIY decorations, and I was really looking forward to being a part of her special day.\n\nBut a few months ago, Sara suddenly uninvited me from the wedding. She said that she and her fianc\u00e9 had decided to have a smaller, more intimate wedding and they had to cut down on the guest list. I was hurt and confused, but I tried to be understanding and didn't say anything.\n\nLast week, Sara called me and asked me to contribute to her wedding fund. She said that because they had to cut down on the guest list, the per-person cost had gone up and they were struggling to pay for everything. She asked if I could contribute $500 to help them out.\n\nI was taken aback by this. I had already spent a lot of money and time on Sara's wedding, and now she was asking me to pay for something I wasn't even going to be a part of? I told her that I didn't feel comfortable contributing and that I wished her the best of luck with her wedding.\n\nSara got really upset with me and accused me of being selfish and unsupportive. She said that I should be happy to help her out, since we were such good friends. But I just couldn't shake the feeling that she had treated me unfairly by uninviting me from the wedding and then asking me to pay for it anyway.\n\nNow I'm wondering if I'm the asshole here. Should I have just given Sara the money she asked for, even though I wasn't going to the wedding? Or was it reasonable for me to decline and feel like I shouldn't have to pay for something I wasn't going to be a part of anyway?", "created_utc": 1683230947, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137yeib/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_for_my_friends/", "score": 144, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I supported you by helping with your dress and decorations, and performing all of my maid of honor duties at my own expense. Then you uninvited me, showing that you didn\u2019t appreciate what I had done for you already at all. You haven\u2019t considered how your actions may be affecting everyone else. The only reason you need more money is because you uninvited me and several other people, so your costs went up. Uninviting me and accusing me of not helping you when I have done so much for you already is the real selfish move and I don\u2019t appreciate being treated that way by my good friend. I hope you enjoy the wedding and the consequences of your actions.\u201d", "NTA\n\nDo NOT give her the money. Smaller and more intimate wedding? So she cuts out her Maid of Honor?? You helping her up to that point is more than enough support she could ever ask for after her decision.", "NTA.

You are not a cash cow and you have contributed enough, especially for a wedding from which you were uninvited.", "Sara\u2019s wedding needs to get even smaller. A justice of the peace costs almost nothing. Very affordable!\n\nYou *aren\u2019t even invited* to the wedding anymore. Why should you fund it, or even give a gift at all? Never mind that you *were* invited-then dumped!  NTA", "NTA\n\nDO NOT GIVE HER ANY MONEY.\n\nShe used you and took advantage of your kindness. Who uninvited someone from a wedding they helped plan, then ask them for money to pay for said wedding!?", "NTA - Please don't let your \"friend\" make you feel bad for not giving her $500. That ask was ridiculous for many reasons.\n\nI can understand cutting down the number of guests for a more intimate wedding... I don't get cutting out your maid of honor. If you're close enough for that, why don't you make the cut for the smaller wedding? That's entirely weird.\n\nThen I'm confused by the idea that, due to having fewer guests, the costs go up. If she downsized the guest list, why not downsize the other things? Does she have the same size venue, catering, etc? Why? That's also weird.\n\nWhen we get to her asking you for money for a wedding you're not even attending, we've gone past weird to WTF is going on here? She seems to be making a ton of questionable choices and resorting to being manipulative to cover that up.\n\nHer wedding budget blues are not your responsibility as a friend. Doubly so since you're not invited.\n\nAlso time to reconsider this friendship.", "NTA. \n\nYou only get gifts from guests. \n\nIf Sara wants people who aren't coming to her wedding to pay for it then there's something called Gofundme that she could try. \n\nShe's a user, and she's trying to grift a little more out of you and calling you selfish for not falling for it, block her and move on with life.", "NTA\n\nThis is the most insulting thing I've read in a while.

Let the guests that are going foot the bill.", "NTA - with friends like that, who needs enemies?  500.00 is a LOT of money.  Especially if you're not even going to be there, WHAT?", "NTA. The proper thing would have been uninviting AND refunding you. It's easy to understand she had to cut the list, but if the ceremony is still as big as to request the bride to ask for \"help\" here and there, there definitively was space for someone who had ALREADY spent time and money on it", "Sara is the asshole. Also... If you're one of the people she can cut from the wedding that quickly, you two definitely arent as close as you think you are. She's using you", "There are friends. And then there are false friends.\n\nWhen you tell a real friend \"*No*\", they understand. They back off. They apologize if they've made you uncomfortable.\n\nWhen you tell a false friend \"*No*\", they don't take that as an answer. They berate you. They get angry. They call you names.\n\nIf you're lucky, Sara is temporarily insane because of this wedding, and **IF SHE APOLOGIZES**, maybe you could consider being her friend in future.\n\nBut my guess is, you will be backing away from this friendship. I also guess that the reason she got mad is she got a **100%** \"No\" response from all her de-invitees who she hit up for $$.\n\nNTA", "I don't understand what it is about weddings that make people think they can make outrageous demands and get mad when people call them on their entitlement.

She doesn't sound like much of a friend anymore.", "NTA.  Wedding costs aren't flat.  If they're inviting fewer people, that's a smaller hall, less food, etc.  Ergo, less money.  So this is a double whammy of BS.", "LOL, she's really got balls to ask you for money for her wedding. Of course you're NTA, I'm surprised you have to ask!", "NTA! \"No\" is a complete sentence. She is the cause of her costs increasing, not you.

She could always have had a smaller wedding without uninviting you specifically, instead perhaps uninviting someone else who *hadn't* already put in effort/money.", "NTA. Heckkkkkk no. That\u2019s pretty rich of her to uninvite you and still expect you to contribute $500. If anything, your seat should have been guaranteed since you were \u201cpaying\u201d your way. \n\nBuy her a small token wedding gift, and call it a day on your friendship.", "NTA. Sounds like something has happened and they are in a financial hole.  They are using you and probably others without telling the whole story.", "NTA", "NTA.  Apparently, she thinks your money is more important than you since it's on the guest list but you aren't. \n\nOne would imagine that the person selected to be the maid of honor would be included in their smaller guest list.  The math ain't mathing here.", "NTA at allllllll! \n\nWow, she sounds entitled. You should just reply that you already contributed enough for a wedding you aren't even invited to. If she wants wedding gifts/contributions then those doing so should have an invitation in hand.\n\nNo invite? Then no obligation. If she doesn't apologize for her presumptions, I would go LC. $500 is not a small ask for most people.", "NTA. My bridesmaids maybe paid $500 by the time the whole thing was over but that was on expenses for them to be in the wedding. If you aren't in the wedding, you shouldn't have to spend anything. None of this \"well now that you aren't paying for a dress, you can help me.\" It is already tacky to ask people to give money or stuff to help pay for the wedding (I hate \"stock the bar\" parties that are for the purpose of the wedding bar) but even worse to ask for that much money. Plus, if she cared about you for a friend, she would downsize but still include you and other would-be-bridesmaids in what she can. My husband is going on a bachelor trip for a friend who is not having a whole wedding and not once is that guy saying \"I know I am not having a wedding but give me money anyway\"", "NTA.  She wants your money but not you.  Jerk move.", "NTA. I know little to nothing about wedding planning, but how is a SMALLER guest list increasing their planned budget? Was Sara expecting guests (even those of the original list) would be paying to attend? Have vendors increased their prices? And how is the Maid of Honor even cut from the guest list in the first place? I\u2019m dubious about the reasons OP was uninvited.", "NTA! \n\nThis woman has chutzpah. If she doesn\u2019t even have the funds for a MOH she ALREADY INVITED she should elope.", "At this point. I wouldn\u2019t even send a gift. Thats pretty ballsy to expect you to pay for the privilege of not being there.", "NTA. I'm so curious as to why you didn't make the cut. Using my previous knowledge of Reddit wedding drama it makes me wonder if it has to do with race/sexuality or something that the groom's family has an issue with.\n\nBut yeah..no one would contribute to an event they won't be attending.", "NTA What is going on with these crazy wedding posts? Weddings really bring out the jerk side of so many people.", "NTA\n\nYour friend is being selfish and greedy.", "> She said that because they had to cut down on the guest list, the per-person cost had gone up\n\nthis makes zero sense.  even if the per person cost goes up, the total cost goes DOWN.", "NTA.

If she wanted you to pay for the wedding; then she should have sucked it up & showed some respect at least because that\u2019s how life works sadly.", "She can't have it both ways.

I wouldn't want to financially contribute to the wedding of someone who uninvited me, either.

If anything, she should be paying you back what you dropped on her original wedding and I think you'd be well within your right to demand she do that. Maybe also invoice her for the time you spent helping her prepare for it - $40/hour sounds about right to me.\n\nAfter that, think carefully about whether Sara's treatment of you is what you deserve and if they are the actions of a true friend.

Its not much harder to cook 100 chicken breasts with steamed veggies than 80, so places tend to discount price per head as the volume increases.\n\nMy guess is that they cut people based on the bulk pricing, ie $100 per plate for 200 people, so they could spend that budget elsewhere. When they cut the wedding to 50 guests, they expected to be saving $15000, because it\u2019s 150 fewer people at $100 per plate. Now the venue sees that, and calculates for labor, and says the plates are now $150 per head, so they only saved $12500 and they\u2019re still over budget.", "The venue probably had a minimum seating so to keep the venue they are going to split the costs over a smaller amount of people. They made it smaller thinking it would be cheaper but the venue probably said \"you agreed to the terms and costs\"."]}
