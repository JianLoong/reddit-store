I don\u2019t think anyone should drive a car like that with a fresh license.\n\nYesterday at work, I got a phone call from my mother, she asked me how I am, and we got to the point of the conversation when she mentioned taking my sister car shopping, i didn\u2019t really reply anything to that, she said \u201cyou know if someone wasn\u2019t that selfish, your sister wouldn\u2019t have to go through all the expenses of purchasing a car\u201d \n\nI replied:\n \u201clook, no matter how much nagging and labeling you do, I will not give her the car, it was left for me, she doesn\u2019t get to act like a fucking asshole to me, because she thinks she\u2019s entitled to it, your car was almost totaled because she was texting, I wont give it to her because she wants to look cool in school for rolling up in a Benz, if I was her I would spend that money on driving lessons, because she needs it.\u201d\n\nLittle did I know, I was being ambushed, my sister replied while I was on call to my mother implying that they were both in on it, she said:\n\n\u201cYou are the biggest fucking cunt, you are nothing more than a selfish asshole, GGF is probably rolling around his grave watching his grandson be the biggest disappointment in this fam-\u201c I hung up, and I just burst out in tears, my boss heard everything because she was screaming, and she gave me a hug and then went back to work.\n\nSo currently, i use both cars, sometimes this, sometimes that, I don\u2019t want to sell either, but maybe it\u2019ll be a good thing if I need to take either car to the mechanic.\n\nI feel like an asshole, what do you think?\n\nUPDATE: firstly I want to thank you all for your comments, kind words, and everything basically, my mother called me about 10 minutes ago, apologizing about yesterday, she told me that my sister is grounded and after speaking with my father they took out their contributions to her savings for a car.", "created_utc": 1687263878, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14e9qmn/aita_for_not_giving_my_sister_the_car_i_inherited/", "score": 848, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You just have to keep it in that sweet spot and your car won\u2019t move, all you will have to do is add gas when you get a green light and off you go.

OP bought the Polo himself with his own money. He pays for his own home, insurance, parking and upkeep on both cars. He does not need the money he would get from selling his beloved Polo, so why badger him about doing so?", "Oh no problem it\u2019s different everywhere so yeah, I did pass with 40 hours on the first try, but here in the driving lessons they teach you like in school, so what I mean is you first learn how to control the car then you get out onto the streets, and eventually you do have to drive on a motorway, or a dual carriageway, as you would say it. \n\nI am speaking from honesty, even to this day I am always trying to avoid carriageways because I\u2019m just so scared of the speed and the other drivers especially the reckless ones, it only takes a small movement of the wheel or anything minor and you have a really bad accident in your hands.", "You just need to install a kill switch. I used to have one too. \nThat would be handy.", "Cars don't have distributors anymore, either.", "An ejection seat would be pretty cool too, but probably too expensive", "You can definitely decide to press charges or not. If OP is not willing to cooperate with the investigation, they will drop it.", "Thanks!!!", "I can understand not wanting to drive a manual car, as my ADHD will make me forget, so it's easier to have an automatic. But that doesn't entitle her to your car, I'm so glad your father is on your side with this", "Ooh I hadn't thought of that!", "Oof, yeah, I would NOT be getting an SUV to a beginner driver [given what I\u2019ve learned about them recently](https://youtu.be/jN7mSXMruEo) about how safe they are, especially with your sister\u2019s history.", "Yes, a lot of excellent cars aren't available here. My husband is seriously irritated that the Toyota HiLux isn't sold here. I am more annoyed about the well made,  affordable,  efficient subcompacts that aren't available.", "He can give a whole car to her, his old car. Is that not enough? And when there's a will, respect it. That's what I did in my case where others got houses and I got some empty field but I didn't say anything lmao", "One has an apartment and the other lives with her parents.\n\nBut I get what you mean, but I suggest you read the post with a different lens \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffe. He seems more mature to me than his sister. Don't fixate on the age and consider his perceptive. Helping his sister to get her own car, has his own place, car, got a job and generally doing way better than I was at his age. If those aren't some traits of maturity and understanding responsibility, then I need to go back to school . \n\nBut heyho, at least we agree on one thing, the sis should not get Merc no matter what \ud83d\ude01.", "We don\u2019t have driving lessons in school - I think it might be USA who has Drivers Ed ( not sure so again apologies if wrong & im not sure how much Drivers Ed does so hopefully a US person can comment!) . Young Drivers is a private organisation here - but to me it was worth the money so son didn\u2019t start official driving lessons knowing nothing. And yes, Young Drivers started from being able to control car , learn about it, drive around - but on a private circuit not public roads. \n\nWe have both dual carriageways and motorways U.K. - some people only do dual carriageway experience in lessons but can pass their test! \n\nYes it\u2019s different everywhere - totally agree with you - and one small error \u2026\u2026\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve always told my son - it\u2019s not that I\u2019m particularly worried about his driving ( because like you, he\u2019s sensible) - but it only takes one person \u2026.. \n\nAnd those that can\u2019t be trusted - ie tx when driving; no experience of a powerful car; showing off; - that\u2019s your sister!", "I thought the same thing", "I had one in my first car. I had an engine malfunction that cause us to think it was the kill switch and had it uninstalled but I loved the safety of knowing it would be an extra hassle if someone wanted to steal it because I would pull it out when I went to San D proper instead of the burbs.", "That would be funny watching her on the cameras getting ejected", "Never ever buy a new driver a new car. It usually ends up getting wrecked within the 1st year. I've seen it happen too many times!", "Got to say, we do like the VW Polo - son chose 1.2 as 1. Saved for it himself. 2. Lower insurance. 3. Like OP, figured a Polo manual was a really good starter car plus easy to park! 4. Better car than the Corsa. 5. Our neighbour is the chief workshop maintenance manager for VW in the U.K. \ud83e\udd23 although we didn\u2019t actually know that when he bought car! \n\nAs his Mum, I\u2019m jolly glad he chose it. It\u2019s a really nice little car.", "Yeah, like you just got your license, your not going to be driving a Mercedes period, in my experience, maybe the polo was too powerful for a starter, like me 2 years ago, but at that time, I was in love with the polo because I drove one with my instructor, an older model, but after some getting used to, the 2017 polo was great for me in the long run, not too powerful over all, but still, it showed me with power comes greater responsibility, and back then after driving alone for the first couple times after I bought the car, I told myself and everyone that I don\u2019t need very high-performance cars, because you\u2019re not used to it, and you could possibly cause an accident when you drive a car that is not suitable to your current level of experience.", "We do have Drivers Ed in the US, either through high school or a private facility, where you go for a set number of hours to be able to earn your driving permit. Though it may be different in rural areas, just because everything is so spread out.", "Kinda same thing here, my engine would start revving really high, and low up and down when I stopped at a light. Had it uninstalled and then it turns out it was the \"prom\" chip. lol", "If you dont use it often the fuse box in it will have a main fuse. Just leave the thing unlocked so you can pop the hood and it wont start until you put the fuse back. Do this until you install a kill switch. Also something to look into is a magnetic lock and killswitch. That way the electric locks wont work until a killswitch inside the car has been deactivated, and you have a magnet somewhere behind the glass with a magnet on the keyfob. Like this but there are many options https://watsons-streetworks.com/product/magtech-magnet-entry-system/", "My fiance is 32 and finally got his license. I'm secretly saving up for another car juuuust incase.\n\nHe doesn't drive much or far, but it's a statistic that I'm well aware of. Definitely don't hope it happens, but just incase.", "It's better to be safe than sorry."]}
