{"id": 20145, "submission_id": "14e9qmn", "title": "AITA for not giving my sister the car I inherited from my late great-grandfathers will?", "selftext": "Context:\nSo 2 months ago, my GGF (great-grandfather) (85m) passed away due to pancreatic cancer, and in his will he left me (19m) his 2019 Mercedes Benz GLC SUV. \n\nHe always told me that he will leave the car to me, because it\u2019s something he dearly loves, and wants to see it in good hands. \n\nI drive a VW polo 2017, which I\u2019ve had for 2 years, it is my first car. \n\nMy sister (17f) has just gotten her license, she admitted to passing the test out of pure luck, and she almost crashed my mothers car for texting.\n\nThe reason I made this post:\n\nSo for the last month or so, ever since the car got put in my custody, my sister has been nagging me, nonstop, because she wants the Mercedes, she told me that I don\u2019t deserve to have 2 cars, I\u2019m a selfish person who is inconsiderate to his family. \n\nI\u2019ve helped her pay for her driving lessons, and I offered to help her get better at driving by letting her drive my VW, but she refused, because she doesn\u2019t want to drive manual transmission.\n\nI\u2019ve also been helping her save up for her first car, by with my own money to her savings, she wanted a fiat 500, and she has saved up enough by now to get one used.\n\nI have considered giving her the car, but her recent attitude towards me made me remember what my GGF told me, about him wanting the car to be mine. I don\u2019t think anyone should drive a car like that with a fresh license.\n\nYesterday at work, I got a phone call from my mother, she asked me how I am, and we got to the point of the conversation when she mentioned taking my sister car shopping, i didn\u2019t really reply anything to that, she said \u201cyou know if someone wasn\u2019t that selfish, your sister wouldn\u2019t have to go through all the expenses of purchasing a car\u201d \n\nI replied:\n \u201clook, no matter how much nagging and labeling you do, I will not give her the car, it was left for me, she doesn\u2019t get to act like a fucking asshole to me, because she thinks she\u2019s entitled to it, your car was almost totaled because she was texting, I wont give it to her because she wants to look cool in school for rolling up in a Benz, if I was her I would spend that money on driving lessons, because she needs it.\u201d\n\nLittle did I know, I was being ambushed, my sister replied while I was on call to my mother implying that they were both in on it, she said:\n\n\u201cYou are the biggest fucking cunt, you are nothing more than a selfish asshole, GGF is probably rolling around his grave watching his grandson be the biggest disappointment in this fam-\u201c I hung up, and I just burst out in tears, my boss heard everything because she was screaming, and she gave me a hug and then went back to work.\n\nSo currently, i use both cars, sometimes this, sometimes that, I don\u2019t want to sell either, but maybe it\u2019ll be a good thing if I need to take either car to the mechanic.\n\nI feel like an asshole, what do you think?\n\nUPDATE: firstly I want to thank you all for your comments, kind words, and everything basically, my mother called me about 10 minutes ago, apologizing about yesterday, she told me that my sister is grounded and after speaking with my father they took out their contributions to her savings for a car.\n\nEDIT: I just wanna say thank you to all the kind words and the time you all took out of your day to comment, as for all the rude comments and calling my Late GGF An Asshole, saying it\u2019s sexist what he did, that is not the case, and I don\u2019t think at this point anyone has the right to question his doings. Feel free to call me the asshole, but give proper reasoning, saying he is an asshole is not a valid point and you will be reported. Apologies if I don\u2019t reply to your comment, I appreciate your contribution to your replies and I am reading all of them!", "created_utc": 1687263878, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14e9qmn/aita_for_not_giving_my_sister_the_car_i_inherited/", "score": 2728, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You just have to keep it in that sweet spot and your car won\u2019t move, all you will have to do is add gas when you get a green light and off you go.

Shame on her and shame on your mom for encouraging her!", "If any of my relatives had given my sister a car like that in their will, I probably would have just asked if she\u2019d take me for a ride in it. That car was given to you by your GGF. Your sister sounds like a brat. I\u2019m a woman, and I would not say your GGF is sexist at all. You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders. Enjoy your Mercedes! NTA!", "NTA\n\nI am late to this party and saw your update but still, you are NTA.  \n\nYour sister will grow up one day...hopefully before she is 22.", "ntah  the car was   left to you glad things worked out for you", ">typical redditor, who thinks the entirety of someone is summed up in a single post by this guy. I don't understand why people like you allow yourselves to believe that's real. \n\nReally ratting yourself out there. You describe something as \"typical\", then explain how perplexed you are by it. Clearly this perspective is something that resonates deep with almost everyone here and likely beyond. It seems downright silly and counterintuitive that you not only fail to communicate well with the majority of a community, but in fact choose to continue being active on a platform whose culture and values perplex you.\n\nHe earned that inheritance in that he maintained a good enough relationship that the great grandad bequeathed this valuable vehicle to him and his brat sister did not. Your rationale of paying forward kindness also doesn't make sense. The point of passing kindness on is exactly that, to ensure that it breeds more kindness. Meaning the recipient of kindness has to be grateful and willing to pay the goodwill forward. Someone who already feels entitled to a five-figure gift and who throws toxic tantrums over wanting it is absolutely not going to pay any kindness forward. In fact, following your logic, gifting this to his sister would be the opposite of spreading kindness since the virtue would die with her.", "NTA. It was left to you, it's your car. If you live in the same house, I would however make sure she never has access to the keys just in case, maybe have a coded lock box.\n\nYou and your parents have been trying to help her save for a car, I genuinely don't know why - he brother only 2 years older - are contributing to this, she is 17 and incredibly entitled. She would be lucky to have a 2005 Nissan pulsar.\n\nI am actually of the opinion that if you want to drive a $80k+ car you should have to do an additional driving test. There are so many large, luxury SUVs on the highways and in carparks that I see nearly causing accidents because they can't drive safely but want to look bougee in a car like that.", "NTA but be mindful of where you place the keys for the Benz. $10 says your sister and/or your mother try to steal them and take the car 'to the mall' the moment you're out.", "I wouldn\u2019t even let her drive either car.  NTA.  Maybe she should get a job and buy her own car", "Your sister and mother were utterly and completely wrong to triangulate against you, trying to force you to give your inheritance to her, for no other reason than she wanted it. \n\nGGF was right. A car like that could kill a new driver. \n\nUnequal bequeaths can lead to hard feelings. If your family hadn\u2019t turned on you, I would have suggested you give your old car to her to either keep, or trade in towards another car. \n\nHowever, abuse like that does not get rewarded.", "I guess that's on the 17 year old to get over instead of forcing OP to sell their stuff. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "Find the video of the kid in the overpowered luxury car who almost killed the cop at the traffic stop. Nobody wants repeats.", "Because cars are not an investment of any kind, you're not money neutral with cars. You're dumping money into them to keep them running and you can't really store cars in the garage and not drive them either. Sell the one car (especially in this market) and invest the money or go on a trip or something.", "That's why she doesn't want to drive the manual...can't text and drive if you're working the stick!", "Keeping the VW and the Benz still wouldn't make him an AH.", "The comments don\u2019t bother me to be honest, it is not about gender or sexism, but in today\u2019s world someone just HAS to make it about that. Hopefully she will learn on her own about the way she needs to approach situations in an adult fashion.", "Yeah, I think there was something similar about someone\u2019s brother taking other brothers car or something like that, few comments have mentioned it", "Even if you did sell the car, your sister would probably just demand the money that you got for it.", "Fair, you didn't explicitly say you offered her your Polo. Doesn't change the facts though.", "Yeah it was wrong but at least she realized what she was doing, she apologized, the update is in the post. \n\nBtw out of topic I love your username", "Honestly I would be uncomfortable with a 19yr old owning and driving a Mercedes. There's no way I would let or give a 17yr old who recently got their license such a powerful and expensive machine to drive. Definitely NTA. I would advise to sell 1 of your vehicles though because it's expensive to insure both plus the maintenance cost for 2 vehicles isn't cheap.", "His GGF wrote the will out when the 17 year old didn't even HAVE a license yet, so makes sense to give the car to the kid who has one/is getting one first. \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd26\n\nAnd just because he CAN, doesn't mean he should have to especially You know better than that after the way his sister has been acting. If I were the 17-year-old, I would be grateful that I'm getting any help with getting a car at all, and ask if when I become a more experienced driver if I could maybe get some lessons in the benz, and in the meantime take OP up of their offer to use the other car and learn manual\n \nBut that's just me and I'm not entitled so.", "And that\u2019s when you call the police and she\u2019ll learn her lesson the hard way.", "That is an excellent point about a stick.  I had a young friend text and drive. She decapitated herself by plowing into a FedEx truck.  So hide your keys.", "Cars are almost never a good investment, that much is correct. I should know, by the way; I have 14. \n\nThat said, the question wasn\u2019t AITA for having two cars, it was about giving his sister the car that OP was bequeathed by his great grandfather.
