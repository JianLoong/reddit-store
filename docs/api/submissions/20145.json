I don\u2019t think anyone should drive a car like that with a fresh license.\n\nYesterday at work, I got a phone call from my mother, she asked me how I am, and we got to the point of the conversation when she mentioned taking my sister car shopping, i didn\u2019t really reply anything to that, she said \u201cyou know if someone wasn\u2019t that selfish, your sister wouldn\u2019t have to go through all the expenses of purchasing a car\u201d \n\nI replied:\n \u201clook, no matter how much nagging and labeling you do, I will not give her the car, it was left for me, she doesn\u2019t get to act like a fucking asshole to me, because she thinks she\u2019s entitled to it, your car was almost totaled because she was texting, I wont give it to her because she wants to look cool in school for rolling up in a Benz, if I was her I would spend that money on driving lessons, because she needs it.\u201d\n\nLittle did I know, I was being ambushed, my sister replied while I was on call to my mother implying that they were both in on it, she said:\n\n\u201cYou are the biggest fucking cunt, you are nothing more than a selfish asshole, GGF is probably rolling around his grave watching his grandson be the biggest disappointment in this fam-\u201c I hung up, and I just burst out in tears, my boss heard everything because she was screaming, and she gave me a hug and then went back to work.\n\nSo currently, i use both cars, sometimes this, sometimes that, I don\u2019t want to sell either, but maybe it\u2019ll be a good thing if I need to take either car to the mechanic.\n\nI feel like an asshole, what do you think?", "created_utc": 1687263878, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14e9qmn/aita_for_not_giving_my_sister_the_car_i_inherited/", "score": 380, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But there's a middle of the road where you and her negotiate and she gets your VW, with or without some money contribution. If she only wants the Mercedes, then that's her problem. I say that because I do feel like it's a bit of an overkill for you, a single and childless 19yo, to keep two cars, I would particularly sell the Polo and save the money.", "They are absolutely right about two cars - keep the Benz, sell the VW and ignore their entitlement.

The way you have laid things out here, it also sounds like you have a head on your shoulders. \nIf you can afford the insurance & registration on both,  I'm in favor of having 2 cars, especially if both are paid off.\n\nYou're not being selfish,  it's not your fault that your sister is unwilling to learn to drive a manual and I am appalled at your mother.\n\nIf you still live at home,  keep a close eye on your keys.", "You\u2019re learning early how poorly people can act over estate proceeds.  Your only requirement is to enjoy driving that car, because that\u2019s what your GGF wanted.", "Nta. Text while driving is bad habits. Don't give it to her she will damage the car.", "NTA\n\nMake sure neither your mother nor your sister has access to your keys, or soon you'll have the dreadful call that she totaled the Benz and insurance won't cover it.", "NTA.

You just have to keep it in that sweet spot and your car won\u2019t move, all you will have to do is add gas when you get a green light and off you go.
