I don\u2019t think anyone should drive a car like that with a fresh license.\n\nYesterday at work, I got a phone call from my mother, she asked me how I am, and we got to the point of the conversation when she mentioned taking my sister car shopping, i didn\u2019t really reply anything to that, she said \u201cyou know if someone wasn\u2019t that selfish, your sister wouldn\u2019t have to go through all the expenses of purchasing a car\u201d \n\nI replied:\n \u201clook, no matter how much nagging and labeling you do, I will not give her the car, it was left for me, she doesn\u2019t get to act like a fucking asshole to me, because she thinks she\u2019s entitled to it, your car was almost totaled because she was texting, I wont give it to her because she wants to look cool in school for rolling up in a Benz, if I was her I would spend that money on driving lessons, because she needs it.\u201d\n\nLittle did I know, I was being ambushed, my sister replied while I was on call to my mother implying that they were both in on it, she said:\n\n\u201cYou are the biggest fucking cunt, you are nothing more than a selfish asshole, GGF is probably rolling around his grave watching his grandson be the biggest disappointment in this fam-\u201c I hung up, and I just burst out in tears, my boss heard everything because she was screaming, and she gave me a hug and then went back to work.\n\nSo currently, i use both cars, sometimes this, sometimes that, I don\u2019t want to sell either, but maybe it\u2019ll be a good thing if I need to take either car to the mechanic.\n\nI feel like an asshole, what do you think?", "created_utc": 1687263878, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14e9qmn/aita_for_not_giving_my_sister_the_car_i_inherited/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He gave the car to YOU for a reason.  Your sister is not entitled to anything, and if your GGF wanted her to have it, he'd have left it to her.   \n I mean, he thought about this enough that he singled you out in his will so that YOU would inherit the car.  So keep the car.\n\nYou are going so far above and beyond by giving her money to buy her own car, I'd probably stop that now if you're still contributing.  It was never your responsibility, but after the way she treated you, definitely stop.", "NTA - its your car to use as you see fit. They need to back off BUT so do you. Stop getting so involved with your sistes car issues. Stop helping. Just leave it alone.", "NTA. The car was left to you, end of story. Your entitled sister isn\u2019t kind or even polite to you, so I\u2019m not sure on what basis she believes she\u2019s earned the right to steal your inheritance. \n\nShe\u2019s also overlooking the fact that the insurance premiums for a Mercedes for a 17 year old new driver are going to be insanely high. Almost as insane as your parents thinking she\u2019ll drive it safely. NTA. It\u2019s yours; enjoy your grandfather\u2019s gift.", "I\u2019ve never cheered \u201ckeep it\u201d out loud to a Reddit post but sooo NTA.  Keep it and enjoy!", "NTA. You've enumerated good reasons why sister shouldn't have the car and why in particular GGF wanted you to have it.\n\nAll else aside, the car was left to you and your sister is acting awfully self-entitled to expect you to give her your inheritance just because ...  Yeah, because why? She'd like to have it?", "NTA, your mom and sister sound like entitled assholes, your GGF made a right choice...\n\nI would go low to non contact with these toxic people.. and where is your dad in all this?", "NTA. It was left to you. It's yours.", "I'd say it would be disrespectful to give away the car your GGF wanted you to have. You are definately not the asshole.", "All that over a car? Lol, also why she wants the ggfs car and not your old/first car instead?", "NTA your cars, your decision", "NTA. Your GGF give to you for a reason, because he know you Will apreciate It and take care of It like he wanna. \nYour sister is entitle and she as no reason to doit. \nThese are bouth your Cars and you oferta you old one, she dont acept. \nThats her problem, not yours.\nShe is gonna lose with her attitude.", "NTA. It\u2019s your car. He literally left it to you.", "NTA, it was left to you and is yours.", "NTA - It was given to you. End of story.", "NTA\n\nIt's telling they want the *new* car and aren't, for instance, saying \"you've got GGF's car, could we have your old one?\"\n\nThat said, I'm no car guy but context suggests the car you already had is also pretty kick-ass and just as beyond a texting-while-driving noob.\n\nQuestion: How big a risk is it that one or the other will try to steal the car?", "NTA- and I always say this... to mother and sister- prior to the outburst- we at least had the opportunity to have a conversation, as we were, about the car.  However, given sister's outburst, that is now off the table permanently, and so we're all clear- I WILL NEVER REWARD that type of entitled, bratty, and insulting behavior. Also, I will be paying for nothing for sister going forward. she is on her own. This is her doing and she can learn whatever lesson she wants but the one I'm showing is that- you will NEVER bully me into anything. EVER. I am not your doormat.", "Absolutely NTA. There is a reason your GGF wanted you to have it. She can learn to drive manual it isn\u2019t THAT hard. It just takes practice mostly to learn how to avoid stalling. (Ok, yes, I am still nervous on hills). It might help keep her off the phone having to use the other hand to shift?\n\nAlso, if she called me what she called you, she wouldn\u2019t even get money from me for a car of her own at that point.", "NTA at all, left to you, you should keep it. But there's a middle of the road where you and her negotiate and she gets your VW, with or without some money contribution. If she only wants the Mercedes, then that's her problem. I say that because I do feel like it's a bit of an overkill for you, a single and childless 19yo, to keep two cars, I would particularly sell the Polo and save the money.", "They are absolutely right about two cars - keep the Benz, sell the VW and ignore their entitlement. Plus, once you only have one car, they no longer have the argument AND now you have some nice money from selling the VW. \n\nNTA - put them in the penalty box.", "Sorry for your loss & I hope you have many wonderful memories of the man.\n\nNTA\n\nIt's your rig. Period. Your great grandfather left it to *you*. \n\nAnd you're absolutely right about it not being an entry-level vehicle.  Even as an SUV , it's too powerful and too responsive for an inexperienced driver. Especially one tied up in the \"image\" who already has a history of distracted driving. \n\n  I even have qualms about a 19 year old but I get the vibe that you really *like* driving and are therefore probably a better driver than is average in your age group. The way you have laid things out here, it also sounds like you have a head on your shoulders. \nIf you can afford the insurance & registration on both,  I'm in favor of having 2 cars, especially if both are paid off.\n\nYou're not being selfish,  it's not your fault that your sister is unwilling to learn to drive a manual and I am appalled at your mother.\n\nIf you still live at home,  keep a close eye on your keys.", "You\u2019re learning early how poorly people can act over estate proceeds.  Your only requirement is to enjoy driving that car, because that\u2019s what your GGF wanted.", "Nta. Text while driving is bad habits. Don't give it to her she will damage the car.", "NTA\n\nMake sure neither your mother nor your sister has access to your keys, or soon you'll have the dreadful call that she totaled the Benz and insurance won't cover it.", "NTA.  Imagine if he gave you a house!? \nAlso, you don\u2019t need 2 cars.  Sell one, have fun with the money.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is so not hard. When I was getting my license, I learned on a petrol car and the amount of times that I start is unimaginable. I still occasionally stall from time to time, not because I don\u2019t have clutch control, but sometimes I just get so sidetracked in my head that I don\u2019t realize that I have lifted the clutch up too fast. \n\nIf you want my advice on the hills, if you have to stop press down on the brake and put your car in first gear all while depressing the clutch. when the car is stationary, lift up your clutch to the biting point with no gas, and keep it there, kind of have to find a spot where you don\u2019t move forward or roll backwards. You just have to keep it in that sweet spot and your car won\u2019t move, all you will have to do is add gas when you get a green light and off you go. It is the best technique I have learnt to get over my fear of hills because I know I won\u2019t stall.", "The polo is my baby, she didn\u2019t even wanna drive it to learn, because she only wants to drive automatic, and my polo is manual transmission. \n\nI don\u2019t want to sell my cars, I love them both, and thankfully, I\u2019ve got a really good salary so I am able to live comfortably while still paying the two cars.", "Yes, my polo was my first car and honestly it was the best thing because I also learned on an older petrol polo when driving with the instructor, so it was a safe option. I\u2019ve had my license for about two years now. And I gotta admit, the SUV is a little too powerful even for me. \n\nI work in management, which in my area has a really good salary, I am able to afford a nice apartment, the two cars, my own expenses, such as groceries and clothes, etc. Plus they can\u2019t get into my garage. It has cameras so I can easily find out who it is.", "That\u2019s the main reason, the other reason is that she can\u2019t drive well, she needs more hours of practice.", "Both cars are in garage, locked, also has cameras.
