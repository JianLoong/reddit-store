None of us have cars either, so I don't see my hometown friends very often. The 2 friends still live nearby, they still see each other and are a lot closer.\n\nWe recently made plans to have dinner together (the 3 of us), and I suggested a restaurant and made the reservation. Dinner is tonight, and about an hour ago (3 hours until dinner), one of my friends texted the groupchat and said that she invited 4 other people. I don't know any of the other friends that she invited, and I was so confused as to where and when we made the dinner open invitation, especially when it was confirmed that I had already made a reservation for us last week. I asked her if she meant to our dinner, she said yes. I told her I didn't know that anyone else was a part of this plan, and the reservation is already confirmed and can't be changed. She told me \"so just call the restaurant and change it\". First of all, this restaurant is very popular, hence why I made the reservation so far in advanced, and secondly, the restaurant is closed and doesn't reopen for dinner until 45 mins before our reservation, so I told her it wouldn't be possible. My other friend chimed in and said \"oh I told her we could invite other people\". Why wouldn't either of them tell me, since I am the one who made the reservation and chose the restaurant?\n\nI don't know a single other person that they've invited, which is fine, but I'd like to know ahead of time that this wasn't going to be a dinner in which I could catch up with my old friends and share what we have been up to, but more like a larger dinner party in which I have to small talk and introduce myself to strangers. I actually tried to change the reservation, but any table bigger than the one we had already booked was already sold out for the night, and I told my friends this. My friend moped and said how unfortunate it was to have to uninvite her friends and tell them they were no longer allowed to come. I stood my ground and said I wasn't made aware that there was anyone else coming when we discussed dinner and when I made the reservation last week, and that I would see her at the restaurant. My other friend messaged me privately to ask again if I could nudge the reservation around still, since it was my friend's birthday 3 weeks ago and she wanted to see more of her friends. (Nowhere did we mention that this was a belated birthday celebration, so I did not go into this dinner with that expectation). Note that this friend sees her other friends literally all the time, they all live near each other with cars. I don't dislike her friends as I literally don't know them, but now I'm being made to feel like an AH for not welcoming her friends with open arms.", "created_utc": 1694639286, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16hyvx9/aita_for_not_accommodating_my_friends_friends_for/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
