My aunt was responsible for taxes since she was the caretaker of the home when my grandparents lived elsewhere or traveled, and most utilities were in her name IIRC; adult children and (18+) grandchildren besides her were responsible for portions of utilities... or my sister who became responsible for the phone bill because she was routinely calling someone long distance.\n\nMy answer change comes from a response I received: YTA", "I bet I will get downvotes for this but YTA.

If you were my kid and you spoke this way I wouldn't give you jack shit from a financial perspective on that basis alone, even if I had been happy to prior.

OP's mom is a landlord and knows what she is doing. Is it a lot? Yes. Is it a break? Yes. Moving out has utilities, renters insurance, cable, internet, etc. 1000 is either cheaper than living alone or average rent when you factor in utilities and living frugally. \n\nBeing on your own is eye-opening and 1000 for a room may not be as extreme as many other people's life experiences for OP's situation. Even renting life is expensive outside of rent itself. Life is expensive.\n\nThe post drips with entitlement and where OP hits AH territory. Parents in quotation marks, arguing mom has enough money, etc. The way the OP was worded it seems OP moved out for school and returns home on breaks. This is now a potential 1 year plus break. That is a gap year. This is not an expense out of nowhere if you return home between school and now you may not be going back to school this year. This has legal and tax implications. If not in school and turning 24 these are entirely different circumstances. While I understand where OP is coming from, parents are not responsible for you once you are legally an adult. \n\nI read a lot of misinformation in comments around legality. Fortunately, I work law adjacent for the Federal government and know the laws around kids fairly well in several states. Legally it is complex but a future lawyer should know some of this or practicing law may be hard. This varies a little from state to state, but once you turn 23 some states do not allow active enrollment as a dependent in health care plans except for family plans. \n\nWe don't know OP's exact situation but that is a large expense. ADA did not fix everything. Parents still need to pay for a family insurance plan over a spouse plus one. At 18 / 19 child support and parental support stop when a child is out of high school or drops out. The general thought is 18 but can be 19 if still in high school in some states. The exception is a situation where the child is a lifelong dependent usually from a disability. Some divorce decrees require a college to be paid by a party but unlike child support and spousal support/alimony is often unenforceable. In many states, it is a loophole as states do not have statutes to recoup this money or set boundaries on acceptable levels of expense. \nMost attorneys recommend this is a bad idea and set specific amounts or include that as a cash sum in the decree to often go into a trust. Courts do not look kindly to open cheque decrees or settlements as the terms are ambiguous. \n\nFor tax purposes, the IRS defines dependent as under 19 or a student 24 or younger when the calendar year ends ( IRS had some more rules here too ). Basically, all laws say that you are on your own at 18. Your parents lose all potential benefits when you hit 24 in a calendar year. And for ADA it is an option but not a requirement to have you on their insurance until 26. This was a lot about the legality and legal assumptions but these are things adults should know about their circumstances. \n\nOP has a full degree and is deciding to work part-time when money is needed until potentially fall 2024 for law school. It is unlikely to be accepted in 2023 unless waitlisted but OP did not tell us more details on this. A roof over your head is a need. What mom is most likely doing is a parenting method called 'get out or be responsible immediately' which usually boils down to a deficiency in parenting and makes her an AH if done without warning. Financial literacy should be taught early on. If parents do not set the boundaries early that not actively attending school means you are out or once you get a degree or drop out you are on your own it is bad parenting. But Reddit eats people up who tell their kids at 18 they are on their own. But that's 100% better than springing it on someone. \n\nOP, the right call here is to check attitude and entitlement at the door and talk to your mom as an adult and have a conversation or negotiate the rent. You have a few ways to do that. You can tally up your parent's increased expenses as a dependent status being revoked, the increased utility costs of you being home, etc. She is a landlord, she understands tenant rights regarding guests, fees, eviction, etc. This is negotiating, a skill most attorneys will need and excellent practice. You must know where your opposition stands and why.\n\nOr you can tell her you can't afford 1000 and ask if there are any alternatives knowing why your mom financially feels justified.  You can present the average wage for an intern or minimum wage and explain why you can't afford 1000. Or better yet, apply to be an intern and talk to your parents about an internship search and forgoing rent while working for free.\n\nOr tell her you to want to essentially have a gap year and plan to hit the ground running once in law school and you will not have a break until late into a legal profession normally. This is true and lawyers' pay varies wildly by state/focus and it can be huge hours for years until established. You can ask as a favor, not out of entitlement, to let you live rent-free. \n\nNow personally, my gut is telling me the reason why your mom is doing this is because of the tone of the post. I can assume all day but the expectation your parents owe you just because you didn't ask to be born is like a chip on your shoulder and in my experience is not pleasant to live with. If this is not the case, and knew everything above and has not acted entitled in real life and only here, the question is do want to live with your mom as an adult?

That\u2019s money you could be saving for a home even if you could spare a grand a month.\n\nI will say \n>\tbut I will say I don\u2019t think I owe any parent anything. If you choose to have a kid, that is a lifetime commitment to them. I didn\u2019t ask for it.\n\nI will say, from your post I understand your position here. But I would be careful phrasing it like this. It comes off more entitled then I think you meant it too. Nobody asks to be born, but there we are living. And many parents cannot afford to support their children through adulthood, and ideally they try to parent in a way where they don\u2019t have too. But this is also based on the economy and everyone\u2019s finances and situations.\n\nI guess what I\u2019m saying is, if an adult who wanted to never work and live off his parents because they bore him said this, I would laugh my ass off. This obviously isn\u2019t you, so I\u2019m just saying you\u2019re wording here is maybe not really expressing what you are correctly trying to ask of your mother. But if you *say* it like that, you can bet she\u2019s going to dig her heels in and feel she\u2019s doing the right thing.\n\nInstead you should be asking her what the point of this is. She doesn\u2019t need money from you, you\u2019re not a mooch or lazy, you\u2019re working on a higher education and you need help to save your money so you can have a good future not stress out from sending yourself into debt. She should want to help you make smart decision and save, not take your money when she doesn\u2019t need it and you\u2019re doing your best.", "YTA. Firstly you're 23...an adult, and therefore no longer your parents responsibility. Secondly you clearly have no respect for your mother so why should she help you...just because she gave birth to you??

Grow up.\n\nI will say a grand does seem a lot but paying nothing is also a joke!", "IMO I don\u2019t think you should charge your own children rent when they live with as adults, Their still your kids even when their 18+.

It\u2019s very weird to charge your kids no matter what their age when their living with you.

So NTA.", "Wow...this comment section is toxic AF.\n\nHonestly...NAH. \n\nBro...honest answer is, your parents aren't AH for asking for rent. They're entitled to be that way. Some parents have a very different way of looking at their kids. So many replies confirm that outlook: once you're 18, you're an adult. I disagree. You're still a child. I wouldn't want my son when he's 18yo going off to war any more than I'd expect him to start paying me rent. I want my kid to know I'm always there for them. If my kid has a rush of misfortune, I' rather him come home and stay with us for free than be homeless instead of...\"you can stay here for 1g a month until you get back on your feet.\" Like WTF, some people here are just cold. Unfortunately we don't have the backstory but it sounds like things aren't all roses between you and parents. \n\nPeople are coming for you having no student loan debt. I just paid off my student debt after 20 years. I wouldn't wish that ball and chain on anyone just starting their lives...crap held me back from so much and had to work twice as many hours to get footing in things like buying a home, ect. While I agree it has shaped my perceptions and my behaviors as an adult, I can also agree it shouldn't have to be this way.\n\nThe length of time is a factor as well. Fall 2023 vs 24 are two very different things. When I was between jobs / schooling - I'd often stay at my parent's rent free for a month at a time. I was never the type to just \"stay home\" and always had a job growing up, but the 3 weeks / 1 month between semesters is nearly impossible to find a job at. Maybe you need a breather before going back to law school. Now, if it's 2024...well, bro..no excuse not to work or even intern in a law office.

Its not unusual for a parent to support a child at 23 who is still pursuing their education. Its also not unusual for a parent to start trying to make sure a child at 23 is developing a plan to live independently, often forcing the issue by charging rent. That you don't actually have firm plans to continue your education (you have aspirations, not plans), I can understand why this might be on their mind. How much have you told them about what you have going on? Were you just expecting them to support you for a year and a half before you start law school? If you hadn't spoken with them about that, I guess I can see why they \"suddenly\" asked for rent, but this might not be very sudden for you. They might be initiating the conversation you neglected to have, and now its on their terms.\n\nI'm going to be generous because I don't think your expectations were necessarily out of line, but neither is their approach. They aren't throwing you on the street at 18. You've had 5 years as an adult to start thinking about leaving the nest. Its not unreasonable for them to think about that, either. I think you both need to sit down and have an honest conversation about what your plans are AND what they can comfortably do to support them.

That\u2019s ridiculous.", "Oh, my reading of it was that when he finishes in spring and until he starts law school (possibly fall 2024) he'd be going home, so therefore he isn't studying. I got this from \"My intention has been to return home for the interim, as I have between classes up until this point\"\n\nIs that not what that means?", "I'm not sure about 50%, but yes, living with parents and having no bills can give young adults very unrealistic ideas about normal amounts of available spending money.  I haven't had to resort to this with my one child who went 9 months out of school, because she was  saved more than 50% of her income while working full time.  Now she has a nice savings to buy herself a car and move out when she eventually finishes school.", "You can hit six figures in a few districts of some states, I know California has some, and New York and Maryland are places where  I'm aware it's possible too. There's probably more I don't know about. It's set by the district so it varies even within states. \n\nThat said it requires a Master's, at least a decade of teaching and generally assuming higher duties such as HOD roles on top of teaching to hit that point anywhere. \n\nMy assumption is that if they're somewhere a teacher can hit six figures it's probably a very high cost of living area and $1000 a month for accomodation, bills and food is a steal.", "Same. It's like a subtle way to tell them they aren't welcome.", "Would you feel that way if your kid's plan with their shiny new degree was to... Work part time for pocket money between now and Fall 2024 and not contribute rent at all?\n\nSometimes baby birds need to be kicked out of the nest and learn to fly.", "My guess is $1000 is on the low side of what he'd pay if he were on his own. And if so, property taxes may be close to $1000 a month anyway, and $100K a year is not a lot of money in markets like this. \n\nI feel we aren't getting the whole story, and the \"lifetime commitment\" thing makes me feel he's a bit entitled.", "Where the hell are you getting \u201cmost likely never\u201d from?  What\u2019s most likely is that OP has been accepted into the 2024 start and is waitlisted for the 2023 start.  And you think $1000/month for a room is reasonable?  They could find lower rent elsewhere.  Hell, she\u2019s probably renting out her other properties to strangers for better rates.", "I don\u2019t understand why people think rent is such a difficult concept to get that you have to go through hindering/infantilizing your child by paying fake rent.\n\nI know that when I live on my own I have to allocate money for rent. But I\u2019m not living on my own, I\u2019m living with my family because it\u2019s a financial hell scape out there, so let me use the opportunity to save as much money as I can in a way where *I\u2019m the one managing my spending not my parents*.", "Charging rent to your kids in my country, even if they\u2019re adults it\u2019s not a thing, no one does it, and it doesn\u2019t teach you to live off mom and dad, it helps you save up money. You can definitely teach your kids/adults to be financially responsible without having to force them to play adulthood", "I find this reasoning stupid af. I lived at home until my mid 20s, and when I moved out it was because I wanted to leave, not because my mother made me. We didn't have the best relationship while I lived at home but she never once charged me rent. I'm not entitled and I don't ever ask her for money, not even when I went through a really bad depressive period for almost a year where I didn't work. I went into bad debt that year but I never once asked her for anything and I paid off all that debt myself. \n\nAnd btw, its been over 10 years since I did move out and I am very financially responsible. Was never late with my rent or mortgage, I'm not in credit card debt, and I know how to manage my money. I don't agree with charging your own kids rent, there's other ways to teach them how to be responsible.", ">If his parents are like most parents in the US, they're probably looking at their own retirement accounts right now and thinking that it's probably not going to be enough.\n\nDid you actually read the OP?", "Absolutely I would feel the same.  I don't know the reasons OP may not go to law school until 2024 but they will be going back to school.  They don't have the money, and won't be starting a career yet as they are going back to school.\n\nWhy would I expect them to contribute rent?  I don't need the money.  They can \"learn to fly\" when they are getting established in their career later.", "In one of his posts, he admitted his plan was to work part time for pocket money while he lived with his parents until Fall 2024, when he starts his next round of schooling.\n\nSo he wanted to move back and be a layabouts for 18 months.", "Including bills and food it's a steal in a lot of places. \n\nOP's mother is a high school teacher, but earning 6 figures, which is rare for a US teacher - it only happens in places that are comparably high cost of living, so they're likely in a high COL area. Given that, $1000 is well below market to have all of your living expenses covered.", "We don't know what is included. It could be room, food, heat/air conditioning, electric, water, car insurance, cell phone on family plan, internet, streaming services, health insurance on family plan, laundry, cleaning.\nThe OP is an adult with a college degree. If they don't like the terms of living with parents, they are free to move.", "There's no reason they need to be self sufficient at this point. Do y'all not actually like your kids and not want them to succeed?  Let them save up a little money and prepare for the very stressful time they will have working hard in law school soon. \n\nThey aren't going to be starting a career now, so they will be getting a job making at most a couple of thousand a month for at most a year.  Why would you require them to pay most of that in rent? \n\nMakes no sense to me.", "Or they can get a job at a law office as a clerk, so they can build connections and job experience in their chosen field while also keeping their knowledge sharp instead of thinking they can just jump back into the saddle after eighteen months of loafing around doing nothing but random part time jobs to earn beer money.\n\nI get supporting your kids and all, but it sounds like OP doesn't even want to try to do anything productive in the next year and a half.\n\nI've been living on my own since I was 19, by choice.

You let kids start making their own decisions before they become teenagers. You don't go backwards when they are a decade older.\n\nYour logic is \"you are old enough to pay now, but not old enough to make your own decisions\".", "Unpaid internship. Which is not a choice my parents would have allowed me make. There would have still been an expectation to work somewhere part time at least to earn, which I think is fair.", "Yes. Law school admissions take forever. A lot of people end up paying seat deposits at safety schools in April even while still waiting for all the answers to come in. My last answers came in around July and I ended up going where I paid my seat deposit and I submit the loan applications like late July and got the funding before end of august", "There is when your kid needs a wake-up call.\n\nHe's not getting into law school until Fall 2024. That's eighteen months from now. If he is serious about being a lawyer, he should be looking for a job at a law office so he can get some experience as a clerk.

I didn't want to do anything productive in between undergrad and grad either, and I didn't.  Just worked at a retail store. Then I went back to school.

Let young people enjoy their youth.  Plenty of time later to be stressed out about life and career like the rest of us.", "> I see no problem with adult children caring for elderly parents.\n\nI definitely don't either, it's just that's not exactly a popular opinion on reddit. I just thought it was a bit funny to see people upvoting these comments praising family-oriented cultures, when pretty much every AITA post about parents from said cultures moving in and/or receiving money from adult children is met with a resounding \"don't do it, you owe them nothing, this is why XYZ culture sucks\"", "Got to say, where I come from $1000/month in rent is actually fairly cheap (especially as it'd include utilities, food, furniture and free access to everything else in the house).  In some areas you can't even get a room to yourself in a share house for that amount.\n\nSo I guess the advice for OP is to check how much rent is in his area.  Can he afford to rent his own place for cheaper or the same amount and is he willing to do that.", ">he should be looking for a job at a law office so he can get some experience as a clerk\n\nClerk jobs are for law school graduates, not for people entering law school.\n\n>Expecting to sit at home for free and work a couple shifts a week so you have spending money is entitled as fuck.\n\nAgain, I think some of you just don't like your kids.

He\u2019s going to need a job to pay for law school anyway, might as well tackle both things at once.", "To be honest, I don't really follow or care what reddit thinks.  I kind of stick to my specific hobby subs, and go with my gut, downvotes/upvotes, my life is the same either way.\n\nMy thing is that the US could use a little more acceptance on multi-family homes, especially since Millennials and Zoomers are having so much trouble getting their own anyway.  Boomers and shitty Generation Xers like OP's mom need to recognize times are different now.  In a bad way.", "I'd want my kids to succeed.\n\nNothing says he can't enjoy his time between school, but eighteen months is a hell of a lot longer than anyone needs, especially since it's not even guaranteed he'll get into law school for Fall 2024.
