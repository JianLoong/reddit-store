If you were my kid and you spoke this way I wouldn't give you jack shit from a financial perspective on that basis alone, even if I had been happy to prior.

Prepare them for the reality of monthly rent, but give it back to them in the end because there is no way I will profit off my children.", "Word.\n\nJust because it's common doesn't mean it's right. Nice to know someone on this thread agrees!", "You don\u2019t have to live on your own. But if you want to live in someone else\u2019s house as an adult, you pay them whatever rent they think is fair.\n\nOr you go get your own house.", "show me where a room in your parents that house goes for 1000\n\nedited for refence of the post", "dude 1000 bucks for a ROOM in someone elses house is fucking nuts", "Well now that the OP clarified in the comments that it's less- you are completely right.", "Oh I completely agree that the mom doesn't want th OP in her home.", "\n>Maybe she doesn\u2019t want a non working adult around her house all day\n\nWhich is pretty dumb, they're clearly trying to get an education so working might not be in their best interest at the moment. My mom isn't the best but she even said she'd let me stay home if I had a job or was in school. I doubt OPs mom likes OP.", "Maybe because its his parents and they should be more than happy to house their son. The fact that they have money and they are doing this just makes them even bigger Assholes.", "i like how in your scenario the person who got their undergrad and is going to law school is lazy", "Got it! I should have read that more carefully. \n\nI think the point still stands, at least a tad, in that OP would be getting a studio of his own for around $1100 or $1200 vs. renting a room in their parent\u2019s home for a couple hundred less? Where I\u2019m from, renting out a room in someone\u2019s occupied house is usually way cheaper than having the benefit of a studio of your own. Granted, OP would have to factor in furnishings, etc. But still, OP shouldn\u2019t be paying around the same price for a room as he would a studio apartment, imo.", "My parents did this. When I was that age, it taught me to budget for what I wanted. It taught me to figure out my finances so i could pay rent (though it was low at 200 bucks), budget for snacks and food I wanted (I still ate with the family but I had to buy my own snacks and had my own shelf for them that nobody touched), the fun things I wanted and saving.\n\n\n\n\n\nI quickly figured out a system for budgeting that I still use to this day, and the money comes back to me. Any time I need help or fall behind on things my mom pulls from that account to help me. All of my friends were really irresponsible after they got their first job, and within a year, I had more saved and a better idea of financial security than any of my friends. I still do to this day. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese parents are trying to bleep OP dry, but when done responsibly, this can be a game changer for a kid like me who used to spend compulsively", "you don't have to thank me, i am not upset?\n\nAnyways, i was just pointing out some parents do this.", "Okay, you heard back during normal admission (not the first round bc there\u2019s early admission in October). But by now OP would know if he\u2019s accepted, waitlisted or declined. If he\u2019s not accepted than he needs to start to act like he\u2019s not going law school and part of that is getting anion and paying rent.", "In his college town it would cost $800. In a separate comment, he said $1000 where is parents live is below market for a studio.", "At least he'd have his own autonomy. Too many parents want to charge their children for living at home, but continue to have authority over them. Either you're a kid who needs parenting, or you're a tenant, can't be both.  \n\n\nIt's different if the adult child and parents decide to go in on housing as equally autonomous adults.", "It isn't clear to me whether the OP would save money and if it'd be worth it. It depends on whether he gets utilities included, the quality of the space (the room, the shared space, and stuff like a yard), if his parents are going to be monitoring his every move, and so on.", "I mean I can\u2019t help if OP is lying, sure, that\u2019s valid", "More likely desperately avoiding entering the working world.", "maybe if he was looking for a room to rent  and not his mother but hey im just going off what was presented. \n\nDidnt know this was the post about a guy looking for a room to rent from some random person online can you link me to that part of the post that says that?\n\nif she wants him to move out just say that dont play games NTA", "Yes, and I think legally speaking we have to see it as a childhood commitment otherwise you are ultimately infringing on the rights of others. I think culturally and morally speaking most parents should have some type of commitment to their children in a lifelong sense and for the most part that shouldn\u2019t include lifelong financial support unless you see dire circumstances and those should be temporary. \n\nAnd oh yeah that\u2019s a huge issue. I\u2019m 26 and so many of my peers rely on their parents for multiple different financial assistances. A lot of parents also have little to no financial responsibility with long term investment. I think there are varying degrees of this issue as well. Some people get their car insurance paid by their parents, some people get paid vacations to Europe. In OP\u2019s situation again I don\u2019t think they\u2019re necessarily an asshole because they were staying in a room with their mother, if their mother was renting them a flat it would be different. It\u2019s also hard to draw any real conclusions with the information given because as we have established every situation is different and we have no idea what this parent pays for besides housing.", "He said in a comment that his parents have a \"lifelong commitment\" to support him financially because \"he didn't ask to be born, they chose to have a kid\". So I guess since his existence was thier decision it's thier responsibility to pay from it, forever?\n\nHe's also taking the next 1.5 years off school, but doesn't want to work much during his gap year and a half.", "depends on where you live. Rent where i live is very high, 1k for a bedroom will have a line of people applying to rent it.", "OP lived with them rent free while in undergrad. I\u2019d say that\u2019s ensuring a pretty nice start.", "First thing I found in my area when searching \u201croom for rent\u201d [$1050](https://www.roomies.com/rooms/349657)", "LOL the entire west coast and a lot of the northeast coast", "Not in the Bay Area of California. [A search on Craigslist](https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/hhh?query=room%20for%20rent#search=1~gallery~0~18) shows many rooms going for more than $1000 a month. You can find them cheaper now, but it still seems to be reasonable for places like San Francisco or Berkeley.", "I'm working full time while studying for LSAT and scoring high 160s in PT. So, I think I have a reasonable understanding of the expectations for law school.\n\nI have 5 friends that go to law school, who I met without knowing about their goals to do so prior to meeting them, also work or have worked at least part time between schooling.\n\n**Doing nothing with your life for a year and a half is what makes you lazy.**\n\nIf he attends school this fall, then I'd say it's fair for him not to be charged rent, but if he's going to school next fall then he's being lazy.", "If you used to spend money compulsively, then that's obviously a specific case.  And I'm glad your parents' approach helped you. But I'm talking about the practice of parents holding onto their kids' money as a matter of course. I think, generally speaking, there are better ways of teaching your kids how to budget and helping them become financially literate and independent.", "My applications were not due until November. Most schools don't start sending acceptances until afterwards.", "Yes, I read that too. But with his parents, he would be renting a room in a house, not a studio apartment, so it's not the right comparison.", "Or maybe she wants him to not sit on his ass being lazy for eighteen months, but who knows.", "To be clear, I don't the OP is an AH kind of person from what little I can gleam and they seem to be responsible and headed for a good life.  I'm just judging the one element he brought up and I do think that under the rules of this forum, it was an AH thing to definitively expect at age 23 that your parents will do whatever you expect from them.  Furthermore, the OP invariably would have eaten at least a few hundred dollars worth of groceries, and potentially left more of a mess around the house and created other inconveniences and so perhaps all of that was considered by the mom in laying down her terms.", "I disagree. As an undergraduate, his job was to focus on school... maybe work part-time for mad-money. \n\nHe should work during his gap year and save money towards his own down-payments. He's about to apply to law school and that process is more involved than most people realize.\n\nBut that's not what's happening here. OP has already said that 1000 isn't market value. Given his mom's side hustle, it's pretty clear to me mom doesn't want her son living with her.", "fucking insane i pay 500 for a room in Houston , op says its way above market for his area i still say NTA charging your kid 1000 for a room when you dont need money makes you an asshole", "show me a room in my parents house that goes for 1000 a month", "My sister doesn't spend compulsively, and the approach worked for her as well. She thought she knew how she would budget in theory but in practice had to change her entire plan, and that was for much less than market rent. I think it's a useful thing for almost anyone. Sure, there are other ways, but they also don't mimic the actual trials of adulthood. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy mom also had a fallback. If you lived with her at 18 and missed rent, she wouldn't kick you out, but you were under curfew again (unless it was work or schooling). You gained full adult roomate privelages if you were paying and lost them if you weren't (barring special circumstances). If the rent isn't disgustingly high like in this case it can be a valuable lesson.", "What are you arguing? If you\u2019re arguing that there\u2019s no such thing as early acceptance for law school, you\u2019re just wrong. \n\nIf you\u2019re arguing OP still doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s accepted or not, I still think he\u2019d have heard by now (March) if he\u2019s been waitlisted or not.", "Absolutely, I think we actually agree lol I think OP leaves a lot for us to infer", "That\u2019s not a bad thing. A 23 year old needs to figure out their living situation, and that includes working to afford housing. We also don\u2019t really know about the conditions. Based on OPs replies, the parents have a lot of money and probably a very nice house. So their 1k offer may be at market rate when considering size, location, condition, etc.", "OP\u2019s comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11mw0hu/aita_for_avoiding_exorbitant_parent_rent/jbk10dv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) actually says it\u2019s cheaper than a studio in town, so I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s justified to say it\u2019s \u201cway above market\u201d", "Depending on what area the parents live in, $1000/month might not be very high.", "Again, I disagree. I see it as my responsibility to train them, not just throw them, neck deep, into one of the most difficult aspects of human life and just yell \"figure it out\" from the shore.", "It shouldn't be close to market rent for a studio. I lived in NYC. 1000 isn't high for that space, BUT the room is already there and saved for me. At the market, that room would have been a solid 600, but my parents were doing it to teach a lesson and wanted me to stay in schooling. So to account for the fact that I could only work part time, I only paid 200."]}
