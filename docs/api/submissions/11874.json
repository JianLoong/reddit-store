If you were my kid and you spoke this way I wouldn't give you jack shit from a financial perspective on that basis alone, even if I had been happy to prior.

OP's mom is a landlord and knows what she is doing. Is it a lot? Yes. Is it a break? Yes. Moving out has utilities, renters insurance, cable, internet, etc. 1000 is either cheaper than living alone or average rent when you factor in utilities and living frugally. \n\nBeing on your own is eye-opening and 1000 for a room may not be as extreme as many other people's life experiences for OP's situation. Even renting life is expensive outside of rent itself. Life is expensive.\n\nThe post drips with entitlement and where OP hits AH territory. Parents in quotation marks, arguing mom has enough money, etc. The way the OP was worded it seems OP moved out for school and returns home on breaks. This is now a potential 1 year plus break. That is a gap year. This is not an expense out of nowhere if you return home between school and now you may not be going back to school this year. This has legal and tax implications. If not in school and turning 24 these are entirely different circumstances. While I understand where OP is coming from, parents are not responsible for you once you are legally an adult. \n\nI read a lot of misinformation in comments around legality. Fortunately, I work law adjacent for the Federal government and know the laws around kids fairly well in several states. Legally it is complex but a future lawyer should know some of this or practicing law may be hard. This varies a little from state to state, but once you turn 23 some states do not allow active enrollment as a dependent in health care plans except for family plans. \n\nWe don't know OP's exact situation but that is a large expense. ADA did not fix everything. Parents still need to pay for a family insurance plan over a spouse plus one. At 18 / 19 child support and parental support stop when a child is out of high school or drops out. The general thought is 18 but can be 19 if still in high school in some states. The exception is a situation where the child is a lifelong dependent usually from a disability. Some divorce decrees require a college to be paid by a party but unlike child support and spousal support/alimony is often unenforceable. In many states, it is a loophole as states do not have statutes to recoup this money or set boundaries on acceptable levels of expense. \nMost attorneys recommend this is a bad idea and set specific amounts or include that as a cash sum in the decree to often go into a trust. Courts do not look kindly to open cheque decrees or settlements as the terms are ambiguous. \n\nFor tax purposes, the IRS defines dependent as under 19 or a student 24 or younger when the calendar year ends ( IRS had some more rules here too ). Basically, all laws say that you are on your own at 18. Your parents lose all potential benefits when you hit 24 in a calendar year. And for ADA it is an option but not a requirement to have you on their insurance until 26. This was a lot about the legality and legal assumptions but these are things adults should know about their circumstances. \n\nOP has a full degree and is deciding to work part-time when money is needed until potentially fall 2024 for law school. It is unlikely to be accepted in 2023 unless waitlisted but OP did not tell us more details on this. A roof over your head is a need. What mom is most likely doing is a parenting method called 'get out or be responsible immediately' which usually boils down to a deficiency in parenting and makes her an AH if done without warning. Financial literacy should be taught early on. If parents do not set the boundaries early that not actively attending school means you are out or once you get a degree or drop out you are on your own it is bad parenting. But Reddit eats people up who tell their kids at 18 they are on their own. But that's 100% better than springing it on someone. \n\nOP, the right call here is to check attitude and entitlement at the door and talk to your mom as an adult and have a conversation or negotiate the rent. You have a few ways to do that. You can tally up your parent's increased expenses as a dependent status being revoked, the increased utility costs of you being home, etc. She is a landlord, she understands tenant rights regarding guests, fees, eviction, etc. This is negotiating, a skill most attorneys will need and excellent practice. You must know where your opposition stands and why.\n\nOr you can tell her you can't afford 1000 and ask if there are any alternatives knowing why your mom financially feels justified.  You can present the average wage for an intern or minimum wage and explain why you can't afford 1000. Or better yet, apply to be an intern and talk to your parents about an internship search and forgoing rent while working for free.\n\nOr tell her you to want to essentially have a gap year and plan to hit the ground running once in law school and you will not have a break until late into a legal profession normally. This is true and lawyers' pay varies wildly by state/focus and it can be huge hours for years until established. You can ask as a favor, not out of entitlement, to let you live rent-free. \n\nNow personally, my gut is telling me the reason why your mom is doing this is because of the tone of the post. I can assume all day but the expectation your parents owe you just because you didn't ask to be born is like a chip on your shoulder and in my experience is not pleasant to live with. If this is not the case, and knew everything above and has not acted entitled in real life and only here, the question is do want to live with your mom as an adult?

That\u2019s money you could be saving for a home even if you could spare a grand a month.\n\nI will say \n>\tbut I will say I don\u2019t think I owe any parent anything. If you choose to have a kid, that is a lifetime commitment to them. I didn\u2019t ask for it.\n\nI will say, from your post I understand your position here. But I would be careful phrasing it like this. It comes off more entitled then I think you meant it too. Nobody asks to be born, but there we are living. And many parents cannot afford to support their children through adulthood, and ideally they try to parent in a way where they don\u2019t have too. But this is also based on the economy and everyone\u2019s finances and situations.\n\nI guess what I\u2019m saying is, if an adult who wanted to never work and live off his parents because they bore him said this, I would laugh my ass off. This obviously isn\u2019t you, so I\u2019m just saying you\u2019re wording here is maybe not really expressing what you are correctly trying to ask of your mother. But if you *say* it like that, you can bet she\u2019s going to dig her heels in and feel she\u2019s doing the right thing.\n\nInstead you should be asking her what the point of this is. She doesn\u2019t need money from you, you\u2019re not a mooch or lazy, you\u2019re working on a higher education and you need help to save your money so you can have a good future not stress out from sending yourself into debt. She should want to help you make smart decision and save, not take your money when she doesn\u2019t need it and you\u2019re doing your best.", "YTA. Firstly you're 23...an adult, and therefore no longer your parents responsibility. Secondly you clearly have no respect for your mother so why should she help you...just because she gave birth to you??

Grow up.\n\nI will say a grand does seem a lot but paying nothing is also a joke!", "IMO I don\u2019t think you should charge your own children rent when they live with as adults, Their still your kids even when their 18+.

It\u2019s very weird to charge your kids no matter what their age when their living with you.

So NTA.", "Wow...this comment section is toxic AF.\n\nHonestly...NAH. \n\nBro...honest answer is, your parents aren't AH for asking for rent. They're entitled to be that way. Some parents have a very different way of looking at their kids. So many replies confirm that outlook: once you're 18, you're an adult. I disagree. You're still a child. I wouldn't want my son when he's 18yo going off to war any more than I'd expect him to start paying me rent. I want my kid to know I'm always there for them. If my kid has a rush of misfortune, I' rather him come home and stay with us for free than be homeless instead of...\"you can stay here for 1g a month until you get back on your feet.\" Like WTF, some people here are just cold. Unfortunately we don't have the backstory but it sounds like things aren't all roses between you and parents. \n\nPeople are coming for you having no student loan debt. I just paid off my student debt after 20 years. I wouldn't wish that ball and chain on anyone just starting their lives...crap held me back from so much and had to work twice as many hours to get footing in things like buying a home, ect. While I agree it has shaped my perceptions and my behaviors as an adult, I can also agree it shouldn't have to be this way.\n\nThe length of time is a factor as well. Fall 2023 vs 24 are two very different things. When I was between jobs / schooling - I'd often stay at my parent's rent free for a month at a time. I was never the type to just \"stay home\" and always had a job growing up, but the 3 weeks / 1 month between semesters is nearly impossible to find a job at. Maybe you need a breather before going back to law school. Now, if it's 2024...well, bro..no excuse not to work or even intern in a law office.

Its not unusual for a parent to support a child at 23 who is still pursuing their education. Its also not unusual for a parent to start trying to make sure a child at 23 is developing a plan to live independently, often forcing the issue by charging rent. That you don't actually have firm plans to continue your education (you have aspirations, not plans), I can understand why this might be on their mind. How much have you told them about what you have going on? Were you just expecting them to support you for a year and a half before you start law school? If you hadn't spoken with them about that, I guess I can see why they \"suddenly\" asked for rent, but this might not be very sudden for you. They might be initiating the conversation you neglected to have, and now its on their terms.\n\nI'm going to be generous because I don't think your expectations were necessarily out of line, but neither is their approach. They aren't throwing you on the street at 18. You've had 5 years as an adult to start thinking about leaving the nest. Its not unreasonable for them to think about that, either. I think you both need to sit down and have an honest conversation about what your plans are AND what they can comfortably do to support them.

He hasn't said if he plans to look for a job, either over the summer or longer. \n\nHe's indicated nothing in his original post about willingness to compromise - say, by cooking, cleaning, yardwork, or other chores in exchange for his free lodging.\n\nHis cagey and evasive replies about his family relationships imply, at least to me, that he might've had a falling out with his parents. And now that he needs something from them, he's crawling back to demand they house him free of charge because they owe him.\n\nI've asked for clarification on those points, and I'm still awaiting OPs reply.", "\u201cNaturally,\u201d OP was planning on living with his mom\u2026. I\u2019ve got one graduating in May, and he didn\u2019t assume he\u2019d move back in. He asked. And it\u2019s only until he can save to get a deposit and first month\u2019s rent together. No, we\u2019re not charging rent. Because our son acts like an adult. \n\nIf parents can help out while their kids are in college, that\u2019s huge. Not everyone can. But for a kid to assume he can move back in and have free room and board for \u2026 a few months? a year? a LIFETIME, just because they had the privilege of this guy being born to them?? \n\nThis is the first Reddit post like this I\u2019ve seen that didn\u2019t obliterate the OP for being an entitled A H. I would love to hear the parent\u2019s take on this one.", "Op is YTA. I\u2019m reading law school not starting til fall, potentially fall 2024 as \u201cmost likely never\u201d. The rent request is actually a \u201cget your shit together and don\u2019t expect to live on our dime anymore\u201d statement from the parents who see a kid that just finished undergrad and expects to graduate to parents paying his way thru life while he pretends to try to get into grad school.", ">.

Never took him up on that offer and moved out but it\u2019s always available if I need it. Seems like the bare minimum imo and I\u2019ll offer the same if I have kids.", "It depends where you are. I work in leasing. In NYC a studio at that price would be a bargain.\n\nEither way, I doubt the parents expect him to pay it. They want to push him out of the nest.\n\nAlso, sometimes you have to learn lessons on your own. That's a part of being an independent adult.", "So you\u2019re complaining about below-market rent? YTA", "Then\u2026get\u2026a\u2026.studio\u2026apt\n\nAlso please update us when you move in.

Not expecting to live for free.", "In fairness, my parents did this for me and it really helped me with making sure I had consistent streams of saving that I absolutely couldn\u2019t touch.  It was a big part of why I was able to buy my first property 18 months out or university, and I\u2019m still incredibly grateful!", "I know so many adults who pay rent to their parents for living at home. If you're an adult, you should be expected to help out with adult expenses. Why should the parents continue footing the entire bill for a child that is past the age of leaving the nest? Granted, most people I know do not come from wealthy families, and the parents literally cannot afford to support a grown adult in addition to themselves. Could be a difference in class perspective-- seems like those that come from wealth tend to rely on their families more.", "Not kids but adults\u2026 if you\u2019ve never had to manage money  in 25+ yrs what makes you (or I guess your parents in this case) think you\u2019ll be magically good at it. Especially if you spend the money you *do* get because you don\u2019t have any bills to pay or worry about. \n \n\nThis is just an anecdote, but my partner\u2019s sister is 30 and still lived at home.  She\u2019s in school so whatever but she\u2019s been working and living there since 18 (saying this  to say she\u2019s never lived on her own as an adult)  she has a good chunk of change. I\u2019m talking more than 30-40k saved up. But if you talk to her about getting any level of independence she acts like it\u2019s financially impossible. That she can\u2019t do anything or doesn\u2019t have the money to do it. She tried to get my partner and her other brother, to co-sign on a 10k loan.. She has NO idea how much things cost because she\u2019s never had to pay for anything in her life, she only recently starting paying a car note. She\u2019s graduating  soon and still doesn\u2019t want to leave home because she thinks she can\u2019t do it herself.  \n\nObviously there could be a plethora of reasons why she feels that way, but I feel like if she lived some mock version of an adult who has monthly bills to pay, maybe she\u2019d be able to comprehend how much stuff costs and not be as anxious about doing it on her own.", "depends where you live. 1k a month here will have people lining up for it.", "No, they are responding to the entitlement present in their argument.", "Not to mention, if he doesn\u2019t get into law school this cycle, he needs to do SOMETHING to improve his odds next year. Sitting on his ass won\u2019t do that and they\u2019ll wonder why he was only part time.", "Probably because he didn\u2019t get in for this fall and he\u2019s hoping to find a spot for next year", "I think they meant that the mum was gonna throw stuff at them lmao", "My wife has 9 years of experience and 2 masters - she'll be making 6 figures by 35.

If you're a working adult and living at home and your family needs the income, then you should absolutely contribute. But that's not the situation here. OP is between undergrad and grad school. He has a plan moving forward. He's not moving back home because he's aimless or broke. He won't be there indefinitely. His parents don't need the money, and it doesn't sound like they'd be taking the rent to teach him about budgeting and giving it back to him when he buys a house.", "People seem to be acting like the only way to teach your kids about finances is to charge them rent (possibly with the intention of giving it back to them later on, possibly not). I'm saying that's not the approach I would take. You could just as easily help your child set up a savings account and have automatic withdrawals sent into every month. That way they'll see what their work is going toward and can monitor their balance as it adds up, rather than having it disappear into mommy and daddy's accounts.", "> . You would know by the January at the latest if you\u2019ve been accepted\n\nGo on over to /r/lawschooladmissions and see how wrong you are", "Then they should plan on getting a full time job and paying rent in either of those situations.", "Then he\u2019s being ungrateful because his parents paid fir housing", "Yes. That counts. You are entitled and ungrateful. I would charge you more if you were my son coming at me with that attitude", "Totally counts. They helped you by paying your living expenses because they could have rented it out and received money. Instead they traded it in for this entitled attitude. I can\u2019t imagine why they charge you 1k to move back in.", "Are you living under a rock? It's absolutely brutal out there. Gave some of my friends a literal burnout and I'm close to getting insane as well.", "Thing is, OP wont be studying.

It\u2019s usually a 6ish week turnaround from when you apply.", "When I got loans a portion was out in my parents name. And depending on the school it's not just tuition you are paying for. That's just the classes. You also have room and board (which based on ops responses it sounds like they lived on campus outside of the time they spent going to community college), class fees (for classes that cost more than standard), textbook and online access fees, etc\n\nMost people expect their parents to do what they can to help you go, and if they don't you have to either luck into more scholarships or get legally independent which parents will fight because they can claim you as long as they are providing stuff like health insurence. I had a friend who gave up her dream to be a teacher because her parents refused to sign what was determined to be their portion (based of FAFSA and financial aid loans) because they didn't believe in her not paying her way (she was working at McDonald's part time during the school year, full time during the summer) and could not bridge the gap.", "If you fill out the FAFSA, I think there's a part where you have to put your parents' incomes. So the government in part expects parents to be paying some college tuition for their kids. Which I think is stupid but whatever", "Yes they are supposed to help you pay for your tuition. I'm sorry your parents didn't", "Well the shitty thing in the us is federal financial aid is based off your parents income until you're 23, or married. So parents who can afford to help with tuition but don't basically screw their kids out of getting an education unless they can get private loans , which are usually pretty predatory. Ask me how I know!  So should people expect their parents to help with tuition? Maybe not, but the US government certainly fucking does.", "I'm in the US and generally kids aren't expected to move out until after college if they go that route.", "My friend did, and still could not go to school. That's part of the issue. You can't afford to just pay your way anymore with 4 year institutions", "He didn\u2019t call her a teacher. He said that she has a teaching job, which could range from kindergarten to graduate level. She would just have to be teaching.", ">\tThese parents are trying to bleep (bleed?) OP dry\n\nNot necessarily. I\u2019m guessing OP is talking about not just a room, but also food, etc. Plus increased water, electric, gas. \n\nIt could be that OP is a lousy roommate and his parents don\u2019t really *want* him coming back to live with them anymore. He could be messy, thoughtless, expect them to clean up after him, loud when they\u2019re sleeping, leave laundry in the machines for days, inconsiderate\u2026 or they might just like being alone. There is at least one of our kids we don\u2019t ever want living with us again for many reasons.", "A lot of countries in Europe, and in Asia.  The millennial generation has been hit hard with recessions and setbacks all over the globe, and in many of those countries it'd be unthinkable to kick their kids out, or not let their kids back in, if they're not kicking in big rent money.

Grow up.", "Did you go to the subreddit? It's full of people still waiting to hear back at all from some schools.", "I would not have taken it even if they offered. My parents work hard enough as it is. I rather they spend their money on  themselves.", "Yes xD bleed. My phone really likes to turn bleed into bleep for some reason. \n\n\n\n\n\nI suppose, but also, it's one thing to expect him to pay all of what he'll use. Aka pay for his own food and utilities, but a thousand is asking a bit much from a student just out of classes. \n\n\n\n\n\nThere is always the chance they do hate him, in which case, don't be passive-aggressive little shits about it? I know my grandma wouldn't want me to live with her again because we conflict on everything. There is no need to be passive-aggressive with to high rent.", "I mean it\u2019s all relative. \n\nSounds like OP\u2019s parents are fairly rich and did the bare minimum.", "Never said early acceptance didn't exist,. I'm simply pointing out that your timeline is a little off, which your whole argument \u2014that OP should know by now\u2014 hinges on.\n\nThis of course is based on my own personal experience.
