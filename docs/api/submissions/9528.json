{"id": 9528, "submission_id": "10xuxqm", "title": "AITA for refusing to take custody of my daughter?", "selftext": "I (40F) and my ex-husband (43M) Paul have an 11 year old daughter, Megan. We currently live in an English-speaking country, and this is where Megan was born and raised. Our divorce ended a year ago. Paul has custody of our daughter by agreement, and I pay alimony. I was laid off and am unable to find a job here, so I accepted a job offer in China. I have to move there a few months' time. China is where I am originally from. I cannot stay here without a job as I am not a citizen and do not have any residency status.\n\nEven though Paul has full custody of Megan, she currently stays with me four days a week because he says he cannot manage her. Paul told me to take Megan with me to China as he doesn't think he can manage Megan on his own. He said he will give me custody. Much as I want to have my daughter with me and to have custody, I don't want to do that, because I think it will be really hard for Megan in China. She barely speaks/reads any Chinese, and there aren't any international schools where my job offer is. That means that I will have to enrol her in a local school, and she has to take all her lessons, like math and science in Chinese. She's also dyslexic, and she had trouble with Chinese classes we sent her to previously (which we stopped after a semester). We discussed boarding school but we both agree Megan will do very badly in that because she needs a lot of help with studying. Paul thinks that she will eventually adapt to learning things in Chinese because \"children are adaptable\", and that \"dyslexic children in China must manage somehow\". I think she should stay here, in her current school, especially because this school happens to have a teacher who is good with dyslexic students. I can't guarantee that any local school where my job offer is will have that.\n\nAlso, Megan is likely to lose all her friends from here, because Western social media is banned in China. For example, to keep in contact with her friends, they have to join WeChat just to chat with her, because Whatsapp can't be accessed there on the local networks.\n\nPaul was furious when I said I wouldn't take custody, and has been making a lot of racial slurs at me plus snide remarks about how he can't believe a mother could not want her own child. My family back in China are also calling me an asshole for not bringing their grandchild back to them. They were really angry with me for agreeing to give Paul custody to begin with, when I only did that to avoid an ugly custody battle, as the divorce proceedings were already having a negative effect on Megan. The only one who's on my side is my brother, who's also living outside China.\n\nAt this stage, I don't know whether I'm the asshole or not any more. AITA?\n\nETA:\n\n\\- Megan does not want to go to China. She wants to stay here with her dad and her friends.\n\n\\- I want very much to have custody of her, but not at the expense of her mental well-being.\n\n\\- I hope this will be a temporary situation whilst I find a job that either allows me to work here, or at least in a big city in China where the international schools are.\n\n\\- I am not abandoning her - I intend to fly in every 2 weeks or so to spend time with her.\n\n\\- Her father has never been derelict in his care; he's just someone who will do less if he can. When I have gone overseas for work during the marriage (sometimes for months) and left her in his care, it was all good.\n\n\\- I cannot just take \"any job\" to stay in the country, because I earn more than Paul and am responsible for paying for Megan's education in the Court Order. She is going to an international school now and the fees are very high. Paul cannot afford these fees on his own if I take a low-paying job.", "created_utc": 1675949821, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xuxqm/aita_for_refusing_to_take_custody_of_my_daughter/", "score": 314, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It would of course be extremely hard for your daughter to move to a foreign country where she doesn\u2019t speak the language but will your husband be a good, loving, attentive parent on his own? Just something to consider. Children having loving supporting adults they can trust is probably the #1 most important thing. Would your parents help out if you did bring her?

And in another comment you said she wants to stay. Dad is TA. I mean, he fought for custody and mom still had her majority of the week. Dad wants their daughter to go because he can\u2019t handle it but op is bringing up important reasons like there being no learning resources that the daughter needs for her dyslexia and no way of communicating with her friends. And that might seem like something so minuscule, but imagine going to a new place being cut off from the people you are comfortable with and the people you have to communicate with are very limited because you can\u2019t speak their language. I don\u2019t see a mom trying to dump their kid, I see a mom who is trying to figure out what is best for their kid. It sucks that it can\u2019t be with her but if her daughter is okay with it then that should be what matters.\n\nEdit: the saddest part is that your daughter has to deal with a father that dies want her and make racist remarks about her, even if they\u2019re not directed towards it. It honestly seems like she is in a lose lose situation", "I think you can tell pretty well that the average redditor has virtually NO idea about modern immigration issues. The inability to stay in a country without a work visa is something that haunts all of us internationals abroad. In addition, Mandarin is generally considered to be one of the hardest languages in the world to learn and for a dyslexic child it will be even more difficult. I sympathize with your problems here being an international on a work visa abroad myself. I can tell you are thinking of your daughter's well-being.\n\nNTA, OP. However, you may want to consider whether your husband will be a good guardian to your daughter. He seems racist and appears to consider your daughter a burden. I know you don't want her to be isolated in China, but being with a parent who can't seem to stand her while her mother is on the other side of the planet... I think that will really harm your daughter's sense of self esteem and well-being.\n\nMy recommendation is that you take her with you to China. Your family can try to help you teach your daughter at least conversational Chinese and maybe she can do online school there. The issue of having friends will be a problem but perhaps you can do a wider search when you're there for people your daughter can interact with.", "NTA.

It may be a bad one but it seems to me that what is most important for a child is to be safe with people who want and love her. It is clear that you want what is good for Megan. However, what if you decided to focus more on her emotional security than on her education for now? It\u2019s like people taking a gap year before college. If Megan went to China with you, China could be her curriculum for a year or so of intense, out of school learning. Unschooling, if need be. Homeschooling, if possible. The emphasis on lockstep progression from one grade to the next, one achievement to the next to culminate in the best possible education and profession might well go on hold for a couple of years. I knew a Chinese woman who did college this way, and she was highly educated but a lot more relaxed that those of us who raced through. Are your family in China English speaking? Could they help with this? Would your ex scream bloody blue murder and threaten custody? What does Megan want?She is old enough to be asked and her position is precarious enough that she has probably thought deeply about it. \n\nIn short: less about the student: more about the young girl. If she gets out of college at 25, it\u2019s not the worst thing in the world.", "No, NTA at all.

Id put those into the post too.", "NTA at all for wanting what's best for your daughter! I understand, like too many other posters here do not, that you love your child enough to want what is best for her, even if that means her not living with you. You gave up custody so your child would not experience the stress the custody battle and divorce were having on her. I think, if your daughter weren't dyslexic, you would wouldn't have any problem taking her back to China with you. A lot of posters here also do not understand how dyslexia complicates learning in one's own native language. I simply cannot understand how that's not going to just throw everything catywhompus for the girl. It's going to throw her education out the window. She absolutely does not need to be going to a school in another language with her disability. Her father is a huge AH for not wanting to see how damaging that's going to be for his daughter. Are there any of the father's relatives who would be willing to keep the girl during the school year and let you have her during the summer months, any grandparents, aunts, uncles?", "So wait a minute.

You are trying to do right by your daughter despite this being an impossible situation. Paul seems like a total AH, you gave a humungous amount of good reasons, him saying \"she will adapt somehow\" is top shelf ignorant, and him calling you out over \"what mother doesn't want their own child\" is him projecting his failure onto you. So it's fine for him to dump the girl on you but you making the rational decision what's best for the child is a no go? Yeah, that's all I need to know about Paul.\n\nBut have you asked what your daughter wants? I mean, is she OK with staying behind? Is that even an alternative? Is it possible for her to stay with any of your parents? Or with your brother? Sure, none of the solutions is optimal, but the way Paul behaves, can he be trusted with her? He says he can't manage her, but even despite her dyslexia, how much supervision does she need?
