I'd hold firm too, that nonsense is inexcusable, but with Xmas coming up, that is probably going to cause ructions. I'd be sure this is the Hill you want to die on.", "NTA. they called you a thief, and if your girlfriend wants you to get over it, it will be because she finds it very difficult for people like her parents to apologize.

Best of Luck.", "nta - you deserve an apology but i dont think u will get one they will end up gaslighting and saying they never said that or then say its all in your head i know this type of parents very well.", "NTA. Until you see some evidence that they understand how they messed up, are genuinely sorry enough to make changes to ensure that won't happen again, and take responsibility, it's going to happen again.", "NTA.

If they were good people they would apologize without having to be asked to.", "YTA-\n\nYour partner getting monthly payments isn't keeping her under anyone's thumb. Her parents aren't the ones doing the paying... \n\nAnd her parents should be very suspicious of anyone telling her to take a lump sum because the lump sum is typically a huge amount less than the actual amount, a huge tax liability, and often gone quickly when people are young and don't know how to budget or older and don't know how to budget and often paid out by VERY PREDATORY programs... Like super.predatory.. like should be criminal levels of predatory... \n\nHer parents didn't say anything to you. They questioned your GF about your potential motive. Which is kind of their job as parents. They likely are way too helicopter (which makes sense if they nearly lost their kid when she was little). They are suspicious because YOU ADMIT YOU ENCOURAGED HER TO GET A PAYOUT (which is likely to be predatory).\n\nBut you are now trying to make your partner chose between you and her parents... And that's an AH move too. She gets to decide when it's time to tell her parents to take a flying leap. Not you. Abd if you don't want to see them then don't, but this communication through your partner and using your partners distress as a leveraging point to punish her parents is gross. The one they owe an apology is their daughter not you. Because they said all this to their daughter, not you.", "INFO\n\nDid you, in fact, encourage your girlfriend to sell to JG Wentworth for the lump sum?\n\nWould your girlfriend be using that money in a way that benefits you (e.g., renting an apartment that you would share?)", "You're being TA here by demanding an apology. You are happy to accuse them of wanting to financially control their daughter, though won't say it to their faces.\nAll they've done is have the same concerns about you wanting to steal her money (which is a method of financial control), but decided to voice this, either to you directly or to their daughter who then related it to you. If they voiced it to your girlfriend and she related it to you how would they know you want an apology? Have you even asked them directly for an apology like an adult would?\nWhy should they be expected to apologise to you but you not apologise to them for thinking ill of them? \n\nGrow up, for your girlfriend's sake. Her parents have moved on from whatever concerns they had by inviting you places again. You need to park your ego and move on too. An apology will do nothing about anything other than make you feel like you were right all along. It won't actually change anything. You sound like you'd be just as uncomfortable to be around if you act like this over a parent's criticism of their child's partner.\nShe doesn't need the stress of the conflict simmering along and now that she's finally learnt how to be independent or from underneath their wings she won't hesitate to end it with you for her own well-being.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It had her name on it, even if it went to their address.\n\nMy 20 year old son lives at home.  The other day, he got a letter from the Department of Transport.

I gave it to him when he got home.\n\nBy then we'd already figured out that it was just his licence renewal, lol.  But I didn't feel comfortable opening it.  We are actually very close to our son, and he probably wouldn't have been upset if we did open it.  But I told him the story later and he appreciated that I respected his autonomy and said he preferred that I didn't open it.  In this case, there was nothing secret about the letter.

Also: \n\n\n*She's going to be getting a fraction of her settlement by going through J G Wentworth\n\n\n*Plus her tax burden will be considerable.  And IRS has already very quietly announced that people with middle income or above will be paying higher taxes.\n\n\n*Inflation is sky high, which means she's going to get a lot less value for the little amount she'll have left.\n\n\n* Having a special needs trust also protects her ability to qualify for government programs, the deal being that if the person dies or the trust is dissolved   any money spent by the government will be recouped. That is on top of her tax burden. \n\n\n*The increase in income  may make her ineligible for government programs that benefit first time homebuyers or education grants/scholarships, etc.\n\n\nThe decision to setup a trust with monthly disbursements is practical for the above reasons.", "I work in private equity and she asked my opinion.
