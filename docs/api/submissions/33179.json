If One says, \"hey ya wanna do [this thing at this point in our routine, etc]?\" and the other agrees to it, the next step is the other person then initiating the activity, not the second person ensuring follow through as if they're parenting a child.", "For real bc the whole read I was like \u201cwhy is it that deep\u201d for both parties", "I agree. If this man could accept his fault without trying to make her out to be the crazy one then sure she could have more directly just told him to put on the movie, but if I was being called crazy for expecting what I was told was happening I wouldn\u2019t either. I would also be out of the relationship too though. \n\nMy husband will always try to put on something we both like. Occasionally he will feel like watching something he thinks might not interest me while we are browsing and say \u201cI kind of want to watch this,\u201d if I say I\u2019d really rather not then we will continue looking for something we both want, but usually I will say go for it and I will either watch it too or roam about doing some chores. \n\nIt\u2019s really easy to have a mature conversation, but that is assuming you are in a mature relationship which this is not when OP gets called crazy for not wanting to wait for what amounts to half a movie before watching the movie she was invited to watch.", "True, but don't you think there is more going on here? 30 minutes have literally gone by before they even communicate. Couldn't she just bring it up right after he put on the other movie?", "Pointing out that OP was being passive aggressive isn't \"insane\", its a factual observation.\n\nThe entire conflict is bizarre and really just highlights that there are underlying problems with trust and communication in their relationship.\n\nLike, I don't think it's that strange to get distracted on your way to putting on a movie. A bit thoughtless? Sure. Given OPs reaction, she certainly felt it was rude... But dang. Just be like \"hey, we watching the movie or not?\". If I put something on and my wife was just hanging out nibbling on her food and browsing reddit, I'd assume she was fine with what was going on.", "I\u2019m a woman and say she is being passive aggressive; hope this helps!", "They both sound childish. He has zero attention span and she's pouting and refusing to watch a movie she said she wanted to watch because he watched 30 minutes of some dumb show first.", "Interestingly I am of the opposite opinion. While his actions were not very considerate she made zero attempt to communicate her feelings at the time and instead pouted alone upstairs.", "So would I - and my husband wouldn't freak out over it, either.", "How much do y\u2019all want a bet she\u2019s downvoting all the YTAs and ESHs herself \ud83d\ude02", "How the fuck is she \"exhausting\"?  She left him alone to watch his thing that she wasn't interested in, and changed her mind about watching the movie that night.  There's nothing wrong with that.", "She asked him if he wanted to watch that and he said 20 more min, doesn't seem like someone who forgot or got distracted while picking a movie (that was already decided upon). It also was something only he wanted to watch, not a \"ohh this looks better wanna watch that?, yeah sure looks good\" Kind of situation.\n\nThere was no need to talk about picking a movie when the movie was already picked. She asks, she leaves, and when he's done watching then he goes ask her again\n\nNTA since moment 0 imo", "She doesn't need to. It's just the sensible thing to do if one is interested in maintaining and working on a relationship.\nStewing in silence and letting resentment grow doesn't help.\nAddressing your partner's rude behaviour when it occurs is the best way forward.\n\nIt happens in the best of relationships. We're all human, and we all behave irrationally sometimes. That's when partners need to talk and correct each other instead of retreating to \"He/She needs to get it themselves\" \n\nAgain, it doesn't mean she's the AH. He is, if even just for thoughtlessness. It's just that that evening could have went very differently if she had taken Honey's advice.", "Exactly. This evening could have gone differently with such a small sentence.", "This.", "I'm a woman and feel sorry for you to let people be this disrespectful to you; hope this helps!", ">she made zero attempt to communicate\n\nSo.... like he made zero attempt to communicate his change in plans?\n\nYou also clearly didn't read the part of OP expressing how he will always blame OP no matter what - in this kind of context many stop expressing their feelings as it will backfire. It's rather sad but just how it goes.", "I'm not the poster, but when someone whines about downvotes, I just take it as an invitation to contribute to more!", "No she's not. We are the ones with sense downvoting you. Oh my God. You're absolutely terrible. \n\nHusband said do you want to watch a movie? OP said okay. Husband without any hesitation, plays a completely different thing. OP asks again if this is what he wants to watch. Husband says yes. OP leaves the room. \n\nAnd you think OP is AH? Wow, are you sure you are not the husband here? The way you're defending him, I can bet you're him claiming to be a woman. \n\nOkay I agree OP should have said something but she did not, that's doesn't matter a lot though. Husband started the argument. He should have apologized for not considering her at all. Instead, he is blaming her. He's not a victim. OP is. \n\nNTA", "You did fine.  It's pretty obvious that no matter what you said he wasn't going to put Oppenheimer on until *he* was good and ready, and he might not have put it on at all.\n\nHe shouldn't freak out that you left the room or that you changed your mind about watching the movie.  He's picking fights over bullshit, and I wonder if you'd be better off without him.", "What does this have to do with anything, oh my god, you are SUPER passive aggressive and full of bitterness, aren\u2019t you? I\u2019m so sorry this guy married someone so soul-sucking. \ud83d\ude2d", "Hope you\u2019re single! \u2764\ufe0f", "It sounds like a direct approach may have just set the argument off sooner. His reaction of gaslighting and blaming her is not a good way to deal with what could have been a minor issue. When OP says, \"It got worse. Much worse,\" I get the impression that what followed was pretty toxic. So OP may have been passive aggressive, or may have just been trying to avoid conflict. \n\nOP, I think you might have a skewed barometer for what \"normal\" conflict in a relationship looks like. You seem to just accept being in a relationship with someone that you don't communicate well with. Such a relationship can be more of a negative in your life than a positive, but if you're used to it, it can be hard to see it. Especially if you grew up in a similar environment.", "What, he could have blown up and called her crazy immediately instead of 20 minutes later? Clearly speaking up for herself doesn\u2019t get her anywhere with this guy so she\u2019s learned to just drop it.", "It's 3 sides to every story so just taking what she said and making it your argument just makes you gullible.", "When did anybody whine about downvotes? Do you see the laughing crying emoji", "And you know she\u2019s not how? \ud83d\ude02", "I don't think you know what this sub is for. That aside - this situation OP described is sadly very very common.... and so is having others trying to find reasons as to why the person in OP's spot is \"truly the issue\". \n\nIf pointing this out makes me \"gullible\" in the eyes of a random Redditor, then so be it.", "Even if she is, it's one downvote. Do you see the number of downvotes your comments are getting?", "People are nitpicky as hell.  You didn't use exactly the right words when you spoke to him, you should have said *this* instead.  You shouldn't have been on your phone.  You shouldn't have left the room.  You should have gone back when he came to fetch you.  Etc. \n\nYou made it pretty clear that this isn't a one-time thing but a pattern of behavior.  You tried to avoid the conflict and he brought it to you anyway.  I'm sorry he treats you like this.", "Asking if he wants to watch that does NOT communicate your unhappiness with the situation or give any indication of what you would prefer to happen. It\u2019s a mind-reading question in which you expect a correct answer. Also, you never communicated that 20 more minutes was not a sufficient compromise. This is not rocket science, girl. You sound manipulative.", "The point before you said you scrolled through Reddit, and ate while he watched this other show.  And after that you asked if he wanted to watch it.\n\nPeople who communicate well would sit down and figure out this simple shit right away.  And for the record I don't think you are being passive aggressive, I just think both of you communicate terribly.  Certainly his actions are shitty,", "I don't. it was my first time posting in it but being the son of a manipulative mom, I just don't trust stories until I get all the info. If that makes me an asshole in this sub, then so be it.", "The point is it\u2019s both pathetic and telling for her to downvote when she asked the question, lol.

I\u2019m telling you that fifty million screaming fans are fucking morons!\u201d", "I\u2019m a woman saying she\u2019s wrong; get well soon!", "Well, no one called you an asshole, while you called me gullible, so trying to use the same line doesn't really work.\n\nThat aside: if you need more info, ask OP. There's literally an option for that. But this entire sub is about getting a story and judge it based on it. If you don't like the concept, you're kind of in the wrong place", "OP is not your mam"]}
