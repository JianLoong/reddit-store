Your husband pulled a bait and switch - he said you two were going to watch one thing and then put on another without telling you. You had every right to be annoyed. And the whole \u201cyou\u2019re crazy\u201d is a variation of the \u201cyou\u2019re too sensitive\u201d argument - it\u2019s what people use when called out on their bad acts to try to turn blame back on the people they hurt. \n\nBasically, if you didn\u2019t want to watch whatever he put on television, then you are completely justified in leaving the room. Him saying that you have to stay is him making a control move - trying to establish dominance in the relationship.", "There are way too many TVs in our home for me to feel trapped watching something I don't care about. So, I'm fine just sitting next to my husband while he watches whatever. But, If I'm looking forward to a movie and he isn't ready, I'll go into another room.\n\nYour husband would have been watching the tindler swindler by himself. Its a reasonable compromise, IMO.\n\n\"See you later hon. Goodnight.\"\n\nNTA. You hung in there and got accused of being crazy because you were honest about the routine he pulled? Uh un. Not OK.\n\n\"We don't have anything to argue about. I don't want to watch a movie with you. And I don't want your company right now. Goodnight.\"", "Keep on walking and don\u2019t look back.", "NTA. He sounds like a child, while you do not.", "NTA.  He was gaslighting you.  The real question is what other issues are undermining your relationship - this issue is not one that people would die on a hill for.", "NTA, but you both need to work on your communication skills. As soon as he turned on another show, you should have said \"I thought we were watching Oppenheimer? I don't want to watch this.\" Don't passive aggressively scroll through Reddit while you wait for him to be done.\n\nObviously, if he meant after eating or after watching his documentary, then he should have said that. It is rude to bait and switch like that, especially without communicating it. \n\nYou need to talk about the behavior that is bothering you rather than disengaging and moping. He needs to learn to take his partner's thoughts into consideration, and not just do whatever he wants. \n\nThere is a book about working through conflict that my therapist recommended. It's called Nonviolent Communication. I would recommend both of you read it.", "Ignore all these absolutely insane comments (most likely from men) saying your being passive aggressive.\n\nHe invited you to watch a movie. He then puts on something else. You ask if that is what he's watching. He doesn't ask if you wanna watch it and then turns it around on you when you don't want to watch it with him \n\nHe's the one being exhausting not you. He's also being really fking selfish. \n\nIf this is common behaviour I would seriously consider leaving him because this will be your life. Forever.

Maybe he wanted to finish eating before putting on the movie so that he could focus on the movie. You guys need to communicate with nonabrasive words more than passive aggressive actions (you) and name calling (him)", "ETA. You were being passive-aggressive, and he was being disrespectful.", "ESH, maybe you both have just had a long day or there\u2019s something deeper to this.

My spouse does this all the time, too, except in my household it\u2019s been a 2-year obsession with Taylor Swift. Last night, spouse yelled at me for going to bed at 11:30 for being a \u201cmartyr\u201d because I didn\u2019t want to watch the Eras movie and then blasted Tay-Tay\u2018s concert so loudly at 4AM that I had to leave and sleep elsewhere. Being gaslighted by someone who insists on exclusively controls the remote sucks. \n\nThe nice thing is, spouse stayed up until 6AM doing that and is now unable to function today. That means I have control of the remote! A telling point for both you and me will be what happens when we simply take the remote in order to put on the agreed-upon show next time.", "NTA. And your husband constantly belittling you by questioning your sanity and sense of reality is abusive. I bet he steamrolls over you in other aspects of your relationship in this way. \n\nManipulative abusers tend to exercise these small forms of control so that they can train you to be submissive and tollerate larger scales of manipulation.\n\nNo reasonable or emotionally healthy person will accuse their spouse of being \"crazy\" in this situation.

Sometimes my friend takes a call from her fam and talks for a bit when we're hanging out. It's not necessary for her to pick up and chat because they aren't emergencies but I don't care. If I'm eating, even better. There's nothing passive aggressive about it. \n\nShe trusted that \"just a few minutes\" meant literally just a few minutes and does not need to justify leaving when she was done with what she was doing and he was clearly going to do what he wanted for as long as he wanted. \n\nCould she have left earlier? Yes. Does it matter when she left? No.", "What difference does it make that she was scrolling, if he was already watching a documentary, though?", "I did speak up.

I\u2019m not saying either are good communicators. But it\u2019s not like she didn\u2019t try anything and just stomped off. She mentioned it, then gave up - sounds like these kinds of arguments are pretty common in their house", "Where in this story did she pitch a fit? She got up and left the room.

You are fine, your husband is a dick and I would not be surprised if he verbally abuses you in other ways too."]}
