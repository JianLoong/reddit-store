{"id": 28602, "submission_id": "1748qfr", "title": "AITA for removing my friend from my wedding party after he demanded I start calling him a groomsman instead of a bridesmaid?", "selftext": "Throw away account. So I (29 F) am getting married in 8 months. I am excited to have all of my close friends and family there on my special day, but recently something happened that has split me and a few of my friends. I have recently removed one of my bridal party members, and now I am wondering if I did the right thing.\r  \n\n\nI never cared whether my bridal party wore dresses or suits and told each one as such seeing as three of the five people I asked where guys (my two best friends I knew since I was four and my brother.) My one friend came out as trans a year ago so I told everyone that the only requirement I would like regarding outfits was that they have some form of baby blue in whatever outfit they chose to wear (whether it was a dress or a tie or jacket or pock square).\r  \n\n\n\rMy friend asked if he were allowed to wear a suit instead of a dress and I told him I had no problem with this. He has been tight with money recently so he was unable to come to my fianc\u00e9 and I's joint bachelor/bachelorette party, which I understood and then confirmed with him if he was going to be able to make the wedding, and that I could help work something out with him if the money was too tight for flights or hotels. He told me he would be able to make it but only if I started calling him a groomsman because he didn't like that I was referring to him as a bridesmaid.\r  \n\n\n\rI was confused. I had been engaged for 7 months by this point and I had always been referring to everyone in my bridal party either as a bridesmaid or my wedding party or my brides party since day one. I tried explaining to him that if I were to call him that it would be telling everyone at the wedding that he was on my fianc\u00e9s side and not mine. He got upset and went on to say, I was being transphobic and discriminatory because I refused to change his title. I told him that I could refer to everyone as my wedding party from now on if that made him feel more comfortable but he refused to agree, saying that because he was a guy he needed to be referred to as a groomsman. He then got more mad, claiming that I was a bitch because I had asked him to wear a dress in one of my group messages asking everyone when they went dress shopping to include the baby blue in whatever outfit they chose to buy . (I can see where I probably should have said outfit shopping but when I had put dress I had meant dressy outfit.  And seeing as he wasn't the only guy in the group chat I figured everyone would understand what to get.)\r  \n\r\n\nAfter that I decided that it would be best for both of us if he were no longer a part of the bridal party and that we should celebrate mine and my fianc\u00e9s union a different way. He called me an immature brat and now refuses to talk to me. My other bridal party members agree I did the right thing but some of my other friends say I should have just agreed to calling him that and then had him stand on my side at the alter.\r  \n\n\nAm I the asshole for removing my friend from the bridal party and wedding?", "created_utc": 1696900526, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1748qfr/aita_for_removing_my_friend_from_my_wedding_party/", "score": 512, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Groomsman is a title for the grooms side. the bridesmaid is a title for the bride's side. I get he may be upset with the 'maid' part, but he can't be a groomsman unless the groom invites him, as its those attending the groom. Its not transphobic. \n\nHe was overreacting, and got offended by the mere mention of a dress. Yeah, outfit mightve been a better choice of words but its a simple mistake that you already talked about. A simple \"im still good to wear a suit right?\" Would have been good enough. It seems he didnt want ANY feminine role at all. Im a woman (in my heart and soul) but if my best friend, Male, asked me to be his groomsman i'd wear that dress proudly. \n\nIt was best to remove him, he didnt want to be a bridesmaid, he didnt understand what it ment. He can get mad all he wants but being on the brides side makes you a bridesmaid, its a title.", "He wants to be treated as a man. You\u2019re trying to treat him as a man. How do you normally treat men who call you a bitch?", "NTA - He flat out isn\u2019t a groomsman because he isn\u2019t part of the groom\u2019s party. He could be a bridesman? Anyway, better to lose his drama.", "NTA. Considering the name calling and degree of hostility it\u2019s best all around that he not be in the wedding party. If you were transphobic you would not likely have asked him to participate. Im assuming that he is the proper pronoun and you appear to have embraced him on that way completely based on how you write about him.\n\nI think he is being a bit too hung up on the bridal party reference\u2026 plus it sounds like you were pretty clear about what to wear and that a dress was not the required outfit. I don\u2019t understand the degree of drama he has raised out of this. Either he wants to be part of your wedding or he doesn\u2019t. You seem to have been fine with inviting him.  So why all the sudden is he giving you crap about wedding party terminology. \n\nThe bride had bridesmaids the groom has groomsmen as far as general wedding terminology goes and adapting to calling your side just the brides wedding party seemed a reasonable compromise. \n\nI don\u2019t have any issue with someone being trans or how any individual wants to identify or what pronouns they choose for themselves. It doesn\u2019t seem like you have any issue with it either \u2026 so I am not sure why this had to become so big an issue. \n\nSorry he had to be cut but and I wish you the best for your wedding.", "There are two other men in your party that aren\u2019t making a fuss.

He's obviously very sensitive about what term is used to refer to him and I am sorry he couldn't or wouldn't accept bridesman as that is clearly the correct term.  \n\nAlso, sorry he felt so denigrated but, honestly, he seems a bit hypersensitive. Since you chose him to be in your party and didn't care what he chose to wear, surely he could see you did not object to his being transgender.  I think it is unfortunate that you decided to remove him over this, but he does sound a bit unreasonable maybe making you feel that you just didn't want to deal with the drama he brought.  And certainly his resorting to calling you names is totally not okay.  Sigh.", "Why can\u2019t you call him a brides*man*?", "NTA, this person is insane.", "NTA - sounds like a shit storm that you sail around vs plowing right through. Not worth the brain damage.

Bridesman fine I can understand wanting the maid part changed if you're gonna be that picky but no he apparently decided it was vital he not be part of Your side of the wedding party.

Newfound freedom to demand you be seen as you always felt sometimes makes you like an exposed nerve in a windstorm; everything is liable to become an aggression because you\u2019re relearning the world and your place in it. Weirdly, things become more triggering than they were when you were closeted.        \n  \nThe hyperfixation on groomsman is clearly a gender envy thing; I am betting he is feeling his masculinity is at stake somehow. I am wondering about how all these conversations went down, but the refusal to consider alternative terms as a hill to die on is pretty hard to handle considering the defined names of each party.    \nNTA tbh tho i do have compassion for him.

Have you referred to any of them individually as a \"bridesmaid\"? If not and the only one you've called that is the one trans guy, then you're super obviously the asshole, and transphobic to boot.\n\nIf you've called them all bridesmaids, then you're not automatically the asshole, but you still need to accept that a trans guy is not going to have the same view of that word as a bunch of cis guys do. Trans people are used to constantly being referred to as their birth gender, so having you do it too is just another painful reminder to him that no one is willing to understand how he feels about it.\n\nAll that said, calling him \"groomsman\" is still literally factually incorrect, so I'm not quite sure what his thought process was with that.", "NTA.  Another example of someone being called 'transphobic' because they won't put up with nonsense.  Your group is made up of mixed genders - you call them all bridesmaids to identify them as your party as opposed to your future husbands 'groomsmen' - you are not singling anyone out, and you said they could wear what they want as long as your colour is part of it.

I would drop them too - you don't need this at your wedding.", "[deleted]", "NTA - My friend has a trans person in her bridal party, and she referred to him as her bridesmate? Would that be an option?\n\nThat said, IDK if he'd still be willing to be part of the bridal party or if it is worth the drama considering?

That sucks.", "ESH.  I believe the term is bridesman, like groomswoman. And that's been around long enough that you should have known it and changed your wording.

Secondly, if he is so determined to die on this hill and even go so far to call you transphobic, I have to ask: have their been other times, since he came out as transgender, that he digs his heels in on things he believes are not PC regarding him?", "YTA and you seem a little transphobic to me. Your friend came to you, expressing his feelings, and you disregarded him. I understand it's your wedding, and your day, but you could have invented a new title or given him a nickname.

It wasn't relevant to the story at all.", "YTA gender dysphoria is a real thing and saying bridesmaid to a trans male is probably super triggering.

So I (29 F) am getting married in 8 months. I am excited to have all of my close friends and family there on my special day, but recently something happened that has split me and a few of my friends. I have recently removed one of my bridal party members, and now I am wondering if I did the right thing.\r  \n\n\nI never cared whether my bridal party wore dresses or suits and told each one as such seeing as three of the five people I asked where guys (my two best friends I knew since I was four and my brother.) My one friend came out as trans a year ago so I told everyone that the only requirement I would like regarding outfits was that they have some form of baby blue in whatever outfit they chose to wear (whether it was a dress or a tie or jacket or pock square).\r  \n\n\n\rMy friend asked if he were allowed to wear a suit instead of a dress and I told him I had no problem with this. He has been tight with money recently so he was unable to come to my fianc\u00e9 and I's joint bachelor/bachelorette party, which I understood and then confirmed with him if he was going to be able to make the wedding, and that I could help work something out with him if the money was too tight for flights or hotels. He told me he would be able to make it but only if I started calling him a groomsman because he didn't like that I was referring to him as a bridesmaid.\r  \n\n\n\rI was confused. I had been engaged for 7 months by this point and I had always been referring to everyone in my bridal party either as a bridesmaid or my wedding party or my brides party since day one. I tried explaining to him that if I were to call him that it would be telling everyone at the wedding that he was on my fianc\u00e9s side and not mine. He got upset and went on to say, I was being transphobic and discriminatory because I refused to change his title. I told him that I could refer to everyone as my wedding party from now on if that made him feel more comfortable but he refused to agree, saying that because he was a guy he needed to be referred to as a groomsman. He then got more mad, claiming that I was a bitch because I had asked him to wear a dress in one of my group messages asking everyone when they went dress shopping to include the baby blue in whatever outfit they chose to buy . (I can see where I probably should have said outfit shopping but when I had put dress I had meant dressy outfit.  And seeing as he wasn't the only guy in the group chat I figured everyone would understand what to get.)\r  \n\r\n\nAfter that I decided that it would be best for both of us if he were no longer a part of the bridal party and that we should celebrate mine and my fianc\u00e9s union a different way.

Reading everything, it sounds like OP will sometimes (or, has sometimes) referred to the entire party as \"bridesmaids\"? But not that she has addressed any of the male members of the bridal party as \"a bridesmaid\"?\n\nSince she claims she wrote \"bridesman\" on the box she gave to him to invite him to be a member of the bridal party (like the other male members of her party), it seems especially weird that he's settled on \"groomsman\" as the only term he thinks is appropriate.  \n\nI do think that what we can't tell from this write-up is how casually members of this bridal party have been in using \"bridesmaids\" as a collective term.  What I mean is that for some people, I could see both the women and the men in the party using \"bridesmaids\" in a winking way -- like, ha ha, in an old-fashioned wedding, the bridal party would be all women, and the groom's party would be all men, and the \"joke\", as such, is that this isn't the case here (and in any number of modern weddings), and we all know it, so if we call the entire group \"bridesmaids\" we're all in on the joke.  \n\nExcept.... yeah, I could understand it if the trans guy wasn't thrilled with that. In which case, asking if they could retire that term completely as a catch-all term, and stick to \"bridal party\" and \"bridesman\" etc., would make a lot of sense.  But OP seems NOT to have had any problem with that notion, and of being more careful to use \"bridal party\" for the whole group.  So what I truly don't get is this one guy's insistence on being called a \"groomsman\" -- as if being a \"bridesman\" was, I don't even know, still too close to suggesting the men in OP's bridal party were taking on some kind of women's role? Or that people attending the wedding might think that?  But the other men in OP's bridal party don't seem to be worried about that.\n\nI feel like being a trans guy in this situation does mean being sensitive to appearances and formality in a way that the cis guys wouldn't be.
