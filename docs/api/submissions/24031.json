I mean, ignoring the rudeness of it, don't people understand you should be minimizing germ contact and all that for young babies?", "NTA\n\nYou're right - lots of people love babies, and a subset of those people seem to treat any baby that they see as public property.\n\nI never minded people smiling at my baby, or making faces at them or whatever, but when they get up in our space and want to start touching is when I have a problem.", "NTA\n\n> So WIBTAH if I started saying something like, \u201cWe\u2019re enjoying a private conversation.

People, especially the elderly, are so invasive these days. They're literal STRANGERS to you and think it's okay to ignore basic manners because of a baby. Not to mention, you have no idea who these people are or what they've just done. Them getting close to and touching your 4 month old is so so dangerous. Try and stay as polite as possible to avoid drama, but definitely start getting defensive and asking them to leave you alone.", "NTA. I'd love it if you jumped up screaming at the top of your lungs \"HELP! They're trying to take my baby!\"\n\nIt'd be the perfect response if it wouldn't scare your baby.\n\nPregnant bellies and little babies are not community property.", "Absolutely NTA.", "ROFL.

React strongly, but don't be overtly or loudly aggressive/confrontational. If they come too close, quickly pull back with a bewildered and disturbed look. Look at other people in that \"wtf did you see this?!\" kinda way. Give your husband the \"what on earth is happening here\" look special. If people interrupt your conversations without consideration to you or asking/apologizing for taking up time, give them a weirded out side eye and continue talking to your husband with an \"...anyway...\" \n\nThese people should be shown that they're behaving inappropriately. Nonverbally social shaming them for being weirdos can be very effective for that.", "I would generally ignore people who walked up. You don't owe anyone your time or attention.

It\u2019s not love or supportive and it damn well shouldn\u2019t be respected. Personal space and boundaries should be respected. Don\u2019t touch someone else\u2019s kid/baby/anything without consent.", "Totally fair. But imagine, if you will, how quickly that time adds up. My husband and I were interrupted 4 times in 30 minutes this morning while trying to enjoy our coffee. If we give each person 3 minutes, that\u2019s nearly half our time. \n\nWhat I\u2019m also wondering is how to ask them to end their visit. What can I politely say to let them know that their time has expired?", "Not sure where OP is but I\u2019m in the UK and had strangers try to touch my bump when I was pregnant and then get super close while I was carrying my daughter in a sling, or try to stick their heads in the pram. In my experience it\u2019s white women in their late 60s or older.", "Mostly with positioning and body language - if someone was starting to get too close, I'd move either the baby or myself so that my body was moving a bit closer to in between the baby and the stranger, and usually that made people back off. With the baby in a sling, this is easy. With the baby in a pram or a shopping cart, it's a bit harder because the baby is more exposed, but usually worked. When they didn't take the hint, I'd step further in to the space and say something like \"excuse me, would you give the baby some space please. Thank you.\"", "I can\u2019t imagine what it would be like if I actually looked approachable most of the time. As-is I think it has been just enough to keep *almost* all of them from touching my kid.", "Ok, that\u2019s also fair. How about just one polite interchange? There\u2019s a way to convey disinterest without being rude (tbh I\u2019m not the best at this tho). People usually make one comment as an opener, and if you respond briefly and turn away, that\u2019s the end of it. If you respond and then wait for their response, they\u2019ll often run with that as an invitation to a whole conversation. \n\nAnd the other person will vary in their ability/willingness to pick up on your cues also, so you may have to make your disinterest more obvious if they keep going. It can depend on how much they\u2019re longing for interaction with babies as well. \n\nIt\u2019s a matter of balancing things and you\u2019ll get better at it over time. It is true that when you have a baby, many people will be drawn to them and to you, and feel a kinship to you. \n\nI had three babies, now grown, and I miss those days. I don\u2019t usually make comments about babies I see in public, but I have sympathy for those who do. I\u2019ll usually wave/smile at the baby tbh, since I\u2019m more interested in connecting with them than the parents. \n\nCongrats on your little one!", "Say the baby needs to be changed and take him to the restroom.", "This sounds like a nightmare.", "So what was annoying today is that the baby WAS in a sling. They were literally lowering their faces to my boobs to look at him", "That\u2019s super helpful, thank you!!\n\nSo maybe a quick and polite response to them, then a very visible repositioning of my body to make it clear I\u2019m refocusing my attention on my coffee?", "In that case the perfect response is \"are you trying to see the baby or my breasts? Because I consent to neither.\"", "I had that happen once. It was one of the first times I\u2019d left the house with her in the sling, just had to pop to the corner shop for milk or bread. I can\u2019t remember now it was over a year ago. But this old buddy got right up to my boobs and daughter. I turned my back on her and walked away. \n\nHusband told me I was rude, but I\u2019d rather be rude than have a total stranger close enough that I can feel their breath on my chest.", "Sounds like a plan! \ud83d\ude0a"]}
