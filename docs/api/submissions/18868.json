Together you can figure out what her boundary is, repair the conflict, and grow your trust and strength as a couple.\n\nI will say- in the future, make sure she knows going into it that you got a girl a gift and what it is so you can  get her friend a gift and she feels involved and included.", "More info.

Why was this a surprise to her?) is also weird and that weirdness is amplified by the fact that you had to be monitoring her friend's social media to know about this show and her interest. That implies some not-good things to your girlfriend and friend group that you likely don't want to be saying. \n\nYou are most likely going to have to reassure your girlfriend a whole bunch and never do something like this again. Your choices are 1) token gifts of $20 or less, or 2) (the better choice) picking a gift from the pair of you.", " Most couples do gift together. I can see where you tried to reciprocate the gift her friend had given you. It was thoughtful and fit your style. Your gift to her was thoughtful as well. Here's the problem. She's your gf's friend first. So as wonderful as your gift was, it was a bit much coming from the guy dating her friend especially when it sounds like you've not been dating for very long. So I don't think you were trying to shame your gf, you did go a little overboard. (Were you trying to make a good impression? Cement the good guy role?)  You're NTA but you may want to explain that to gf and maybe next time discuss her friends' potential gifts in the future.", "NTA for the gift but I am suspicious about your relationship with this \u201cfriend\u201d.   As you could tell from all of the remarks at the birthday dinner your gift was over the top", "Slightly fishy. So INFO: Why did you not get a couple's gift from the two of you? Also, why didn't you mention it to your gf at all previously? It's her friend who has become your friend after all!", "Why do you guys gave separate gifts as a couple to a friend\u2026. That is the most kind boggling thing to me\u2026", "I am surprised that you and your girlfriend didn't communicate beforehand about what gifts you would be giving.", "She prolly thinks you are fucking her friend. NTA for the gift but you may wanna talk to your gf", "For some reason ... For some reason .... For some reason ....\n\nIt's crazy how many times you used that phrase. Are you seriously *that* bewildered by everyone's reactions?? If so, you're *incredibly* dense. \n\n\"Her friend got me a nice gift so I wanted to return the favor by getting a gift that was *twice as expensive and very difficult to get*. For *some* reason, everyone was surprised by that! herp derp\"", "Ehhhhh...Not sure how to rule here, somewhere between Y.TA and NAH I guess? You should be giving gifts together as a couple if you're in a serious relationship, and then you could both share in giving her the joy of the tickets. As it stands, from the outside it looks like you're interested in the friend.", "NTA, maybe.  She cares too much about the price of things, or (more likely) she's feeling second place with your relationship with 'the other woman'.  If the latter then you really need to fix it or you really will be the asshole.", "NTA", "INFO: does the friend put so much effort in her gifts to your gf too?\n\nTbh I don't think your gf is *actually* concerned about the monetary value of your gift compared to hers\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "INFO: are these Taylor Swift tickets?", "INFO: was the other ticket you gave her meant for you to go with her?", "NTA\n\nWhen people pull out the mental calculator to compare gifts (and complain) is right about the time I would just stop giving gifts.\n\nSide note\u2026 Gift in German means poison.\n\nCynical? You bet!", "Am I the only one who finds it odd that OP happily joined the group of girlfriends for their party? Or am I just old and set in my ways?\n\nYeah, not communicating about what gift each was giving is interesting as well.", "Am I the only one wondering if OP\u2019s GF might be thinking about more than just that gift?

Especially as the friend got you an expensive sentimental jersey from the talks only you and her have, that's quite the gift for a friend's boyfriend.\n\nI think you need to be honest with yourself, is this relationship strictly platonic?", "This was not the problem. I think she was embarrassed because every friend there could think that you are having an affaire with the bff. Hey, I even thought about it, the way you talk about her, there is definitely an emotional affaire there. So you're not an TA for the gift, but a massive AH is your breaking you gf heart. Be good and just leave them all alone, don't ever contact the bff and break up with the gf. Read your post and look the way you say that you can't talk about everything with your gf. You couldn't even talk to her beforehand about the gift you where going to give to your gf friend. Gift that you put money and thought about it. (hey, by the way the gift of the bff gave you is weird, way too intimate. She's definitely into you, and your gf has doubts).", "Tbh if I saw this kind of gifting between my best friend and boyfriend, I\u2019d assume they were having an affair. I want to say NAH but be aware of the optics.", "NTA.\n\nNotice what interests people-> give them a gift that aligns with their interests\u2026 Simple.\n\nYour GF is mad because she couldn\u2019t intuit what her own damn friend might like, while you did. Or because you spent more money on \u201cher\u201d friend than what she would have, or because your gift was received more favourably than her gift. \n\nFrom the way you describe \u201cher\u201d friend, I can\u2019t even conclude that you are secretly into her or anything, so imo, your girlfriend is either projecting or jealous. \n\nYou could solve it on a low level by making her a co-gifter I bet. If Dave and Angela gave Betty  a thing and everyone clapped, she probably wouldn\u2019t have a single negative thing to say. \n\nBut Dave gave Betty X and Angela only gave Betty Z, so INSECURITY.", "NTA", "Yeah.   I agree.  It doesn\u2019t seem like GF is mad about him buying her friend a nice gift\u2026 but for being upstaged.  This could have been solved by a quick heads up.  I mean they both knew they were going to this party?  The topic of gifts never came up? \n\nOP\u2026 talk to you GF.  These type of communication issues snowball into greater things.  Just how you should never assume anything at work.   It\u2019s even more dangerous in a serious relationship.", "Also, Slightly fishy.

Strange that they hadn\u2019t discussed gifts, let alone a joint gift!", "That\u2019s a good thought. The main question that comes to my mind is has he ever spent $150 on one gift for his girlfriend? Is he the type to do this for other friends?", "Fwiw, I take his story with a grain of salt and expect some embellishing and leaving out details that would make him look like an asshole \n\nIt's just a guy feeling i and others had especially with him saying \"(she just gets me)\"", "If the $150 dollar tickets are for something similar to the Taylor swift tickets , then those are difficult to get and also were reselling for 1000s of dollars. So because it was difficult to get , it was the topic of conversation. It is strange why your gf didn\u2019t ask you what you got for her friend or why u didn\u2019t mention that you bought such a thoughtful gift for her friend. Just reassure her that you are not into her friend and was just returning her thoughtful present.", "NTA. Your girlfriend sounds rather childish to me, or otherwise has issues regarding money.

It would have been perfect had it come from both of them.", "And if not go in on it together, at least talk about it? It sounds like his own gf didn't know what he got for the friend, which is a bit odd to say the least.", "Right?", "So according to you a guy can\u2019t be friends with a girl. It has to be about sex. The only AH here is you.", "That felt like back-tracking.", "Exactly, making the gift incredibly precious and rare. So OP clearly went out of his way to find them and pay (a lot of money) for them. I\u2019m not saying that that is how the girlfriend is feeling, I\u2019m pointing out that she MAY feel that way and it MAY excuse the way she is behaving now. I\u2019m also not saying anything about male/female friendships but OP needs to sit girlfriend down and have an honest conversation with her.", "He said they were all flirty saying they want him to be their best friends so they can get treated like that", "Lmao how you get that?
