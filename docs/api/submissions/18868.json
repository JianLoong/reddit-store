Then hear her out in an open minded and curious way how she\u2019s feeling to understand better and repair. If you feel yourself getting defensive, pause and identify what upset you and ask a question to BETTER elaborate and understand her point in a rational mindset vs emotional. Together you can figure out what her boundary is, repair the conflict, and grow your trust and strength as a couple.\n\nI will say- in the future, make sure she knows going into it that you got a girl a gift and what it is so you can  get her friend a gift and she feels involved and included.", "More info.

I don\u2019t think that\u2019s much better for most people", "Have you ever had a best friend before?", "Honestly, I haven\u2019t really gotten or give birthday gifts to my friends in years. My closest friend I hosted her party at my house this year but usually my friends and I send birthday texts! I only give gifts to family, and only my side because my husband\u2019s family aren\u2019t got people except for kids\n\nSo long story short giving separate gifts is weird, but gifts at all is even weirder to me", "The last 2 sentences of the last paragraph, where they were \"joking\" they wanted him \"as a bestie\" so they can get pampered like that\n\nShared interests are a factor, yes. So is remembering small minut details for a sentimental expensive gift\n\n If those men were attracted to other men yeah they likely are. Otherwise no, if there was a sports bar with hot women into sports as much as the men, no woman would go home alone", "He never called it a vacation he called it a trip. Didn't say where. Probably a work trip to Scranton and he took her along for company and said it was her gift", "If you want to give lousy gifts that's fine, but don't disparage those who give nice gifts.", "Yeah well your husband's friend isn't your friend is he? In this case OP's girlfriend's friend is his friend too.", "This was the solution. It\u2019s strange that what they each got was never discussed prior to the party.", "Did you read the post? It is all about gf and bf and bff.", ">Probably a work trip to Scranton and he took her along for company and said it was her gift\n\nOh you went along too? Did you take photos?\n\nStop being an AITA stereotype and inventing scenarios", "I don\u2019t want my husband to think I\u2019m fucking his mate so yeah, I\u2019ll give lousy gifts.", "I\u2019ve known my husband\u2019s best mate for 10 years. I doubt OP can say the same about this girl.", "The thing is, I don\u2019t understand not even talking to my SO about this. We talk about all sorts of mundane things. Bringing up the gift I plan to get someone who we are both close with would be a no brainer. Even just to check if the friend would like the gift. \n\nIMO the problem here is communication", "I\u2019m talking about going way out of your way to get something thoughtful for someone you\u2019re really not close to. \n\nHe\u2019s only friends with her because of his gf. She\u2019s not his family , she\u2019s not his best friend.\n\nAnd again, WHY didn\u2019t he mention his intended gift to his gf? Or ask her if it was a good idea? Or ask her to pitch in?\n\nHe bought her a gift that blew everyone else\u2019s gifts out of the water to the point that it became the main topic of conversation.\n\nBoyfriends usually do this kind of thing. Not your best friend\u2019s boyfriends.", "This is Reddit for you", "We have only one bias side to the story and missing information, it's not against the rules to speculate.  It's only fair to press him before making any judgement", "Are you OP on a separate account? You\u2019ve been replying to everyone in a defensive way. If not you\u2019re just as clueless as he is.", "So I\u2019m a woman who has quite a few male friends, and my best friend is a man. He\u2019s basically my brother\u2026not in the \u201ctee hee nothing to worry about\u201d way, but in the \u201cmy parents think of him as a son, and we spend holidays at each other\u2019s houses.\u201d We\u2019ve known each other for 7 years and it\u2019s always been platonic. He\u2019s also my roommate (separate rooms, separate beds, just a roommate). \n\nHe is dating someone, I am doing the online dating thing. \n\nIt turns out that men and women can have deep and meaningful relationships with one another *without* dating or having sex. Shockingly, they can actually be friends. \n\nYou better believe I get him *damn* nice gifts for holidays and birthdays."]}
