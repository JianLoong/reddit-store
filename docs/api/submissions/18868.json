The friend often times comes along with my gf and I when we do stuff and we have overall just become good friends. I can talk and relate to her about topics that I can't really relate to with my girlfriend like sport and cars. For my birthday a few months ago, this friend bought me a sports jersey of my hometowns team which I had only mentioned once briefly to her so it was a very unexpected awesome gift. The jersey was not cheap (atleast $80) so I definitely wanted to return the favor when her birthday came along.\n\nThis friend's birthday was a couple of days ago and she invited my gf and I to her birthday dinner with some other girl friends of theirs. Since she got me such a sentimental and cool gift, I wanted to give her something equally exciting. I ended up buying her a pair of tickets to a concert of an artist she posts a lot on her social media (about $150) so I was pretty sure that she would like the gift. After finishing dinner, she opened the gifts that she received. I didn't really think much of it and went a long with it. My girlfriend bought her a nice watch and she seemed to like it. When I gave my gift, everybody for some reason seemed stunned and the friend was really happy about the tickets. Apparently they are all pretty big fans of the artists and the tickets weren't easy to come by. For some reason my gift became the topic for the rest for the night. Some of the friends started joking that they wanted to become my best friend so that I could buy them gifts. I didn't really think much of it because it really just seemed that they were joking around.\n\nBut after the night finished and while driving back to my girlfriend's place, my girlfriend seemed genuinely mad and upset with me. I asked her if anything was wrong nd she just started going off on me about how I embarrassed her in front of all her friends by buying her friend a better gift than she did. I asked her what exactly upset her by my gift and she said that it was the fact that I made her look cheap with the gift she gave.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1685802580, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13zeklw/aita_for_embarrassing_my_girlfriend_by_getting/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If not... You're not an AH but should start planning cool gifts for her too, otherwise it's disappointing for her.", "NTA\n\nHowever I'm not sure why you didn't suggest a group gift with your girlfriend.", "If you buy your gf and all her other friends gifts like this, than you are NTA.\n\nIf it only applies to this one woman, YTA.", "NTA.  But I'll wager a virtual beverage GF isn't upset about being one upped here.  She is more likely upset about the perception of the and jealous of this friendship since it sounds like OP is becoming increasingly tight with this friend, perhaps even moreso than with the GF.  That is the real item to address with her.\n\nEdit: Info: Is OP the +1 to the concert?  That would likely add fuel to all fires...", "INFO: Did you discuss the gift you were getting for her friend? Considering you two are dating and the birthday gift is for her friend...like wouldn't you have had a conversation about this expensive gift?", "NTA as long as you wouldn't have a problem with your best friend getting your girlfriend a really nice necklace that has personal meaning to her and then she got him hard to get tickets to a game but she didn't tell you what she got him beforehand and you showed up to the party with a new blender or something as your present. As long as nothing in that entire scenario would bother you, you're fine.", "NTA for your reasoning, but you definitely could have told her what you were getting so she\u2019d have a heads up. \n\nI\u2019m wondering, her friend got you an $80 jersey\u2026does she put the same money/thought into gifts for your gf?", "Idk if YTA, but you might be thoughtless. I don\u2019t know why you didn\u2019t ask your girlfriend if she\u2019d like the tickets to come from the both of you. Are y\u2019all partners or not?", "Uhhhh....  \nNTA, however it's kind of weird that you and your gf seemingly did not communicate at all about the seperate gifts you guys got for her friend?? I'm kind of surprised that \"Hey, so what are you getting \\_\\_?\" or \"What did you end up getting \\_\\_ for her bday?\" didn't pop up in conversation between you guys considering you're both attending the same bday party? \n\nI think it would've been way better if you guys collaborated on the gift (splitting the cost of the tickets) together, making it a gift from both of you. Considering the price of those tickets, no one would've assumed you guys were being cheap by having it be a gift from the two of you, and you might've avoided some miscommunication and misunderstanding from your gf that way too. \n\nI also think you might need to reassure your gf as to your reasoning for getting her friend that expensive gift; especially if you're not splashing out on your other friends as much. Putting genuine thought and effort into gifts for friends is generally a very nice sentiment; but going all out like that *specifically* for your gf's friend like that can be viewed as kind of sus (lack of better term) IMO, maybe that's just me though.", "Are you into the friend?

I\u2019ll tell you right now: it\u2019s not that she feels embarrassed. Maybe she\u2019s insecure about your friendship, maybe she feels her friend received a more meaningful gift that she received, maybe a previous experience or trauma was triggered for whatever reason so she\u2019s having an emotional reaction. Either way, you need to tell her your intention was not to hurt her, but the impact did hurt her and you apologize for that. Then hear her out in an open minded and curious way how she\u2019s feeling to understand better and repair. If you feel yourself getting defensive, pause and identify what upset you and ask a question to BETTER elaborate and understand her point in a rational mindset vs emotional. Together you can figure out what her boundary is, repair the conflict, and grow your trust and strength as a couple.\n\nI will say- in the future, make sure she knows going into it that you got a girl a gift and what it is so you can  get her friend a gift and she feels involved and included.", "More info. Have you got a crush on the friend?", "I suspect there's some underlying jealousy triggered by this that she can't really articulate so it's manifesting this way. Tread gently here and try not to take it to personally, imagine an identical situation where a handsome guy friend of hers fawns at her all night because she spend \u00a3150 on him. She probably loves both of you and can't bring herself to say what's really bothering her.", "I\u2019m gonna bet you don\u2019t do the same for all your friends so yta. If you feel inclined to get something nice then the gift should\u2019ve been from both of you and gf as a couple.", "NTA.  Sounds like you and your GFs friend are just good  listeners and therefore adept at choosing gifts that will hit the mark. I mean if you want to compromise going forward just make it you and the GF give gifts as a couple.", "NTA \nYour girlfriend should be happy that you got her friend such a nice gift.

Not only would she appreciate the gift but the memories made would also be worth it. \n\n(Anybody else feel like OP and the best friend have more chemistry than the gf, and maybe that\u2019s why she was mad? Maybe she\u2019s aware that you two don\u2019t share the same interests, and she doesn\u2019t put that much thought into gifts for you guys and vice versa probably, so she\u2019s insecure? \ud83e\udd14)", "NTA.

Surely it would come up in conversation. If not, then make sure it does next time. The lesson you should learn here is not to blindside your girlfriend with the gifts you buy for her friends. Ditto when buying for shared friends. Just be open with your girlfriend.\n\nYou didn't necessarily do anything wrong. Your girlfriend is embarrassed which led to her feeling upset - so far she doesn't rise to the level of asshole.", "NTA/NAH - i feel the same way about gifts and try and give back nice gifts when I receive them buuuuut I definitely think you shoulda told your girlfriend about the gift ahead of time, before the party. Waiting until afterwards to explain why you got her friend such a nice/expensive gift was probably a bad call and I do understand why she would be upset afterwords. Although I feel like she may realize she\u2019s more upset with the situation than she is with you. Which could have been avoided had you both discussed this before the party. I hope you guys are able to properly communicate through this and see each others sides though! (Remember it\u2019s not you vs girlfriend, it\u2019s you & girlfriend vs the problem and it sounds like she could use a reminder of that, but I do understand where her hurt is coming from. If this is the hill she wants to die on, I would switch this to fully NTA instead cause she would def be TA in that case but if she\u2019s anything like me, I think she just wants you to understand why she\u2019s hurt and comfort her a little bit)", "NTA your gf should be proud she has such a generous thoughtful boyfriend who values her friends that much! That is a dream guy right there! She has no right to be mad at you", "Yeah, I definitely think some reassuring is in order here :/ It's also strange to me that neither him or his gf had any sort of conversation regarding the gifts they were both getting for her friend? Like... you'd think 'hey, so what are you getting \\_\\_?' would've popped at some point prior to them both going to the same bday for the friend???", "I got my girlfriend a week trip for her birthday. If my friends get me a nice gift, I always try to give them something they would at least equally enjoy back. Since she got me such a nice gift, I wanted to return the favor", "I got my girlfriend a week trip for her birthday. I give friends gifts based on the gifts they give me. If they get me something really nice, I obviously want to give them something at least equally as nice.", "if he does this for her bestfreind then i\u2019m sure he does even more for her", "Ohhh, that's a good idea.  Especially if they want to gift her a bigger, joined gift \" as a couple \"\n\nAnd it's also weird that they didn't even have a conversation about what they are getting their friends. Seems like he did it on the low and was secretive about it. Like trying to impress her. \n\nMaybe I'm reading too much into it", "I bought my girlfriend a vacation for her birthday and give friends gifts similar in value that they give me. So no, I don't get all friends $150 gifts", "Why do people complain about gifts so freaking much?", "And to add on, did you consider giving this as a joint gift from you and your GF?", "It\u2019s pretty rare for non-married couples to have shared finances, aside from a joint account for paying bills if they live together. Plus at this point she\u2019s a mutal friend, not just the gf\u2019s friend. Is there a social issue around becoming good friends with your partner\u2019s friends?

I apologize.", "lmao of course he\u2019s not going with her i mean i wouldn\u2019t be okay with my boyfriend hanging out with my friend ALONE", "i think assuming OP and her bestfriend have chemistry because they like sports is crazy", "This might set specific expectations for others friends who did not see what the other girl got you. Not saying it's a bad gesture!", "I feel that is fair, him trying to impress her. Since why wouldn't he have said ..\"Hey let's do a joint gift, or this is what I'm gifting her.\". A joined gift as a couple would come across less weird. Especially if he doesn't do this for his girlfriend.\n\n\nI except an update soon where OP goes... \"Girlfriend dumped me after buying her a 20 dollar birthday gift.\"", "Genuinely asking, wtf are you on about? I didn't mention literally any of those things.\n\nI find it bizarre that OP and his partner both bought birthday gifts for the same person and never once discussed what they purchased. Seems like a casual car conversation.\n\nI've never shown up to a birthday celebration with my husband and been shocked at what he had purchased. I know what he bought, because we're going to the same party and we talk to each other...obviously.\n\nI'd have that basic conversation with any friend.", "BUT what if they already go to sport events and stuff alone together? I don\u2019t know their life LOL. He could have bought 3 tickets and they\u2019re both + him attending together", "I figured I probably worded something wrong even though i edited this comment like 86 times but I will humor you and your tone LMAO. \n\nChemistry doesn\u2019t have to equal sex or romantic relationships. Platonic people can have better chemistry together than people romantically involved. When I said chemistry I meant them as friends. Maybe OP and the bff get along better, share the same hobbies and interests, and now with the gift giving the gf may be feeling left out/weird and thats why it made her mad.\n\nDid I make myself clearer with this", "Sorry, I made some assumptions that I shouldn\u2019t have. I don\u2019t find it weird to not discuss the gifts you buy with your partner because to me it doesn\u2019t matter what you buy unless you have shared finances or need help picking a gift. It seems pretty reasonable that it just never happened to come up. I also assumed you weren\u2019t thinking of her as a mutual friend because of the \u201cconsidering the gift is for her friend\u201d sentence, but evidently that assumption was also wrong.", "idk he said couple of tickets so..", "Yeah, really reaching with those assumptions.\n\nIt's pretty normal to discuss gifts with friend's, family, and partners. How else do you know you're not buying the same thing for the same person?\n\nI never said it was essential, I just couldn't imagine how it would never come up. Perhaps other people aren't big on communication, that's fine. I just think it's strange.\n\nJust like how you went out of the way to make your assumption filled opinion piece just to inform me that you think it's *not* weird. Entirely unnecessary, but I hope you feel better telling me you disagree lol.", "Oh you\u2019re right! The post said a pair but didn\u2019t say who was going my bad", "I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m on the autism spectrum so I have a hard time with that sort of thing. There\u2019s a lot of things I\u2019m obviously supposed to assume, but then there\u2019s situations like this where I assume too much and people think I\u2019m trying to be mean or prove them wrong when I really just wanted to understand better. I\u2019ll take this as a learning experience to do better in the future."]}
