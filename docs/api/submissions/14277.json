{"id": 14277, "submission_id": "12fkmho", "title": "AITA for refusing to put a picture of my stepsister on the moodboard my sister and I made for ourselves", "selftext": "I (16F) am really close with my older sister Ezma (fake name, 18F). Before she moved out, we together made a funky moodboard for our room, on which we put our baby pictures and just all about written inside jokes and pictures of things we both love, like Ice Age movies (silly ik) and Taylor Swift. The moodboard means a lot to me, as we spent a lot of time bonding with each other all over again while making it.\n\nOn to the issue, I have a halfsister (6F) (same dad, different moms; my parents are divorced and dad remarried) who comes over every alternate weekend to spend time with her sisters, as my dad says. I'm gonna be honest, I don't particularly look forward to hanging out with her because of the wide age gap but she's a good kid and I make sure she enjoys herself every time she's over. We play games, watch movies and overall spend quality time together.\n\nNow she has obviously noticed the moodboard and she always says that she finds it very pretty and that our baby pictures are cute. My paternal grandma heard this and started nagging me to put a picture of her up there too, since she's our sister and deserves it (my halfsister herself has never asked for this). My issue is that:\n\n1. We had especially ordered customized pins for the board and I don't have any extras\n2. Ezma and I look very different now (she's much prettier) but as babies, we looked very similar and those pictures of us looking like each other mean a lot to me, idk why\n3. I like my halfsister, but she's not anywhere close to the place my sister holds. The board is a representation of things we bonded over, over the years and her photo up there just kind of comes off as intruding to me\n\nAfter weeks of nagging, I told my grandma I'm not putting a picture of her on the board for the above reasons and she went off on me, telling me I'm spoiled and entitled and that she's disappointed in me. She said I must hate my halfsister (100% false and she knows this too) and is now refusing to talk to me. My mom and sister are on my side, halfsis has been normal too but my dad said he can't believe I could be this selfish.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Halfsister not stepsister\n\nEdit 2: As I've mentioned in another comment, half sis is not crafty at all right now. She is more interested in playing doctor or house so that is what we do. And yes I did ask her if she wanted to make something with me and she literally suggested making the model of a tsunami so we can pretend her teddy bears were the victims of a 'tsunami attack' while playing doctor lol. If at any point in the future though, she did ask me herself to make a moodboard with her, I will.\n\nEdit 3: I live with my mom. My dad lives with my half sis and wife. She comes over not as a result of some custody arrangement but just to spend sometime with us, which we don't mind.

Your grandmother and father are projecting their own issues onto you and your half-sister relationship. They are creating unnecessary drama.  Your half-sister coming to visit you at your mom's house is proof in itself that you don't hate her. Her visiting you at your mom's house is not the norm.

Your grandmother is stirring up drama for no reason.", "And given my mom and dad are not on good terms, but my mom still doesn't mind because ofc the kid isn't responsible for whatever went down bw my father and her. I know halfsis herself wouldn't want it but I'm afraid my grandma may refuse to bring her over anymore since how dare I refuse politely aka talk back to her.", "You are not responsible for what your grandmother does. If she wants to hurt your halfsister  by doing that than that is her choice. You are young but this is an important lesson to learn it is never ok to give in to someone else's manipulation or blackmail. You do it once and they will continue to use your half sister as a bargain chip to get you to do what they want."]}
