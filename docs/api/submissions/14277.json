Before she moved out, we together made a funky moodboard for our room, on which we put our baby pictures and just all about written inside jokes and pictures of things we both love, like Ice Age movies (silly ik) and Taylor Swift. The moodboard means a lot to me, as we spent a lot of time bonding with each other all over again while making it.\n\nOn to the issue, I have a halfsister (6F) (same dad, different moms; my parents are divorced and dad remarried) who comes over every alternate weekend to spend time with her sisters, as my dad says. I'm gonna be honest, I don't particularly look forward to hanging out with her because of the wide age gap but she's a good kid and I make sure she enjoys herself every time she's over. We play games, watch movies and overall spend quality time together.\n\nNow she has obviously noticed the moodboard and she always says that she finds it very pretty and that our baby pictures are cute. My paternal grandma heard this and started nagging me to put a picture of her up there too, since she's our sister and deserves it (my halfsister herself has never asked for this). My issue is that:\n\n1. We had especially ordered customized pins for the board and I don't have any extras\n2. Ezma and I look very different now (she's much prettier) but as babies, we looked very similar and those pictures of us looking like each other mean a lot to me, idk why\n3. I like my halfsister, but she's not anywhere close to the place my sister holds. The board is a representation of things we bonded over, over the years and her photo up there just kind of comes off as intruding to me\n\nAfter weeks of nagging, I told my grandma I'm not putting a picture of her on the board for the above reasons and she went off on me, telling me I'm spoiled and entitled and that she's disappointed in me. She said I must hate my halfsister (100% false and she knows this too) and is now refusing to talk to me. My mom and sister are on my side, halfsis has been normal too but my dad said he can't believe I could be this selfish.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Halfsister not stepsister", "created_utc": 1680957162, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12fkmho/aita_for_refusing_to_put_a_picture_of_my/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't have to feel any closer to her than you want to but it would be good to at least recognise this.\n\nIf she does ask you could make a separate board with her, make her feel loved and a part of your life, even if it's not as true as she thinks it is.

I'm gonna be honest, I don't particularly look forward to hanging out with her because of the wide age gap but she's a good kid and I make sure she enjoys herself every time she's over.

Yeah if she ever asks me herself to customize a board with her, I would but I ain't editing my existing moodboard to appease someone else lol", "I mean yes half sis herself never asked to be up there idk whats grandma's deal", "If she herself ever told me that she wanted me to make one with her, I will", "My thinking exactly.... a moodboard for OP and SS", "Yeah I'm sorry I got confused and messed it up everywhere. Corrected it now, though", "She made a small mistake\u2026", "The point is she's currently not into crafty stuff rn lol she would want me to operate on and nurse her teddy bears alongside her or marry the two dolls that have already been wed like 500 times before. \n\nBut if there's ever a period after she grows up some more when she ends up wanting a board with me, I definitely will make a moodboard with her", "I love them too they're perfect lol", "This is what I had been thinking too like could I just suck it up? Afterall she's a kid and isn't even around most of the time? But then she didn't ask to have her picture on the board and it didn't seem like she cared about it either so I was wondering...", "Tbh she doesn't care. Yes she said it was cute but she never insisted on being up there and is not crafty in the slightest that's why I didn't bring up trying to make one with her.\n\nif she ever asks me for one tho, i'll make it", "You're right I was thinking of gifting her one of those convertible shimmery pillows with a picture of the three of us on it", "The child doesn\u2019t care though.

Even the kids mom says she shouldn\u2019t do it.", "> Even the kids mom says she shouldn\u2019t do it. \n\nNo. Read it again more carefully. \n\nOP literally said \u201cmy mom\u201d as in OP\u2019s mom, and she also specified that she and the 6 YO have the same biological dad but different moms\u2026 which BTW means they are half siblings, not step-siblings."]}
