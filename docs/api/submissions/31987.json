My boyfriend and I have our own place. My sister (24F) works a lot too and also has her own place with her husband. \n\nMy mom has an annoying habit of asking my sister and I for favors with very little notice. Both of us have dropped everything and cancelled our plans because my mom needed us to watch our step sister. We have asked her so many times to give us enough of a heads up to avoid making conflicting plans. She won't listen. \n\nMy step sister lives with my parents. She's disabled (physically as well as mentally), and can't be left home by herself. \n\nNext week, my boyfriend and I are going on vacation. I only have one weekday off before then, and it's filled with appointments that I need to go to before vacation. \n\nLast week, during Thanksgiving, my mom asked my sister and I if one of us could watch my step sister this Thursday (my day off), from noon to midnight because she and my step-dad are going to a concert. I told her I have appointments that day, and still have to get up at 5 am the next day for work. My sister said she *could*, but would need to change around some plans, and advocated for me saying that I work early the next day. \n\nLast night, my mom called me and said I'm her last hope. My sister has the flu and can't babysit. I told her that I'm really sorry, but I have appointments that I *need* to go to before going out of town next week, and that it's my only day to do it, also that I still work early the next day. I told her that I would have made my plans around that day if I'd known ahead of time, maybe like when she bought the tickets *months* ago. She got mad that I wouldn't just cancel my plans for her. I apologized a lot and all she said were things like, \"yeah, thanks a lot.\" \n\nSince then, I've been feeling so guilty. I'm trying to figure out how to rearrange my day so that I can help her out, but nothing is going to work. I feel selfish for not dropping everything to help. I feel like an asshole. So I'm here to ask, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1701268434, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/186qsbu/aita_for_refusing_to_watch_my_step_sister_on_my/", "score": 370, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why your parents need 12 hours to see a concert raises many questions of its own. Why can't your parents get a nurse or respite care for your sister?", "NTA\n\nYou and your sister are indentured babysitters in your mother's mind.  There is no basis for not giving proper notice.  Your step sister is your step father and mother's responsibility so when you help... that is a favor, not an obligation.  All of this current problem is because she wants to go to a concert.  Has she ever tried to get a professional baby sitter?  If she hasn't, you need to set and adhere to better boundaries (as does your sister).  \n\nThis is a THEY problem and maybe this is her frustration, but it is HER problem and actually... WTF does the Step father do about this????", "NTA but your mother is one for trying to make you feel guilty about not dropping everything for her.\n\nYou're 24, I think it's time for you to talk to your mom as an equal. You're not a child anymore and the world won't end if your mother is mad at you. Let her handle her own emotions.

Bye, gotta go.\"\n\nNTA.", "Don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm. I understand feeling guilty - we all like to be able to help family **when we can** \\- but you didn't create the conflict, your mom did. It's her problem to deal with, and guilting you into dumping your carefully-laid plans at the last minute is not the way.\n\nNTA", ">She won't listen.\n\nWhy shoud she, if you always cave in. Until you start dropping her in the shit, she has no motivation to change", "You have zero reason to feel guilty because you did zero things wrong. You only feel guilty because your mother has trained you to feel guilty by guilt-tripping you every times she wants something.\n\nYour mother needs to learn a skill called Planning In Advance. You and your sister are willing to watch your stepsister, but you need to be given suitable advance notice. Your mother probably knew about the concert weeks, if not months in advance. Why didn't she ask you two back then, so you could put it on your calendars? You also need to be able to decline if you have your own life things to do. You are allowed to go to the doctor and to go on vacation.\n\nThe only way your mom will learn to use this skill is if she has no other choice. It sounds like this was the first time your mother actually felt the consequence of her failure to plan in advance. Hopefully that will cause her to change her behavior.\n\nYour mother is also overusing the skill of \"using your resources.\" In this case, her resources are you and your sister, but she's at the point where you and your sister are being overused. You can't even plan doctor's appointments without hassle from your mother! What's going to happen if you ever have your own child? Children are a lot of work and you won't be so available to babysit your stepsister at the \"drop of a hat\". Your mother needs to find a paid caregiver, someone with background checks and so on, so that your mother can get some respite without always relying on you and your sister.", "NTA\n\nYou are an asshole to yourself... \n\nYou need to learn bout putting up boundaries, and you need to put some up, like, yesterday...", "NTA, Sometimes being a parent means that you have to cancel plans because something came up, it sucks but it is the reality.  You are not wrong, if they had asked when they booked the tickets, you and your sister would have had plenty of time to plan to help them out.  Springing things on you last minute is very inconsiderate of them.   I would not be accepting their last minute requests.  Their lack of planning on their part does not constitute an emergency for you.  Maybe getting in a pinch will teach them the importance of asking ahead of time.  Good luck.", "NTA\n\n Your mothers poor planning is not an emergency for you. \n\nThis is her problem to solve, and you are not the solution to it.", "NTA - some people are always super nice until they get what they want and then when they dont get it they become like entitled little brats. \n\nNo is a full sentence. Use it with gay abandon!", "NTA - your parents need another caregiving solution that is not you and your sister.\n\nYou are doing the best you can to help out, but you have your own lives and your parents need to be the ones ultimately responsible.  It can't all fall on you guys.\n\nYou and your sister should have a talk with them about alternate arrangements because this alone isn't working.", "NTA her outings are not more important than your day off, and it's her child not yours. Not your responsibility.", "NTA - the polite thing for your mom to do would be to check in with you and your sister before buying the tickets. This needed to happen so your mom learns to start planning for your stepsister's care.", "NTA.  You and your sister have your own lives.  Instead of continually relying on you, your mother needs to find caregivers for your stepsister.", "This moment was called breaking the cycle.  Hold the line. \nYour mom is used to guilt tripping you into what she wants.\n\nYes, caregiving is stressful, but it is not difficult to ask a few weeks out for help.\nNTA.", "NTA - your mom doesn't need a sitter due to an emergency, but to go to a concert.   She is welcome to cancel her own plans due to not having a sitter.", "NTA - stop feeling guilty, you did nothing wrong!

Your parents need to find a care giver(s) that they can rely on like any other parent that needs babysitting instead of always expecting you and your sis to drop everything.", "NTA. As you said, if they had informed you when they bought the tickets, then you may have been able to help. But waiting until the last moment, no matter what your plans were, was unreasonable on your mother's part.", "NTA\n\nYour mother is selfish and manipulative. She needs to have care arranged for her stepdaughter that is professional.", "NTA she is going to a *concert.* You are doing required appointments. You are not obligated to always be the one cancelling plans -- has she ever cancelled plans to accommodate *your life?* I would start saying no more often now, maybe if you and your sister stop dropping everything for her immediately she'll learn to let you know in advance!", "NTA- Don't feel guilty about it. Don't sacrifice your life. Your step-sister is your parents' responsibility, not yours. You are not a babysitter.", "NTA. Of course it is hard work to c be a care giver but you are not responsible for your step sister, and in this instance, you are simply not viable . She's asking that you cancel your pre-booked arrangements so she doesn't have to cancel her pre-booked arrangements. it might be reasonable if your appointment was getting your hair cut and hers was an urgent medical appointment, but as you say, she could have asked as soon as she booked the tickets, and of course if she had planned ahead, she could probably also have arranged formal respite care.\n\nSince you say she makes a habit of this, I think not only are you NTA, but that you (and your sister) may need to actually stand firm and refuse to drop everything, your Mom hasn't listened. Maybe you need to let her feel the consequences of her lack of planning - if she misses the concert, or has to cancel other plans, then it may mean she starts to listen or to plan a little better", "NTA, keep doing this until they stop or get the message that you are not a an ad hoc babysitter. Even if you do have the time, say no. This is how you set up a firm boundary.", "Nta your mom is.  She won't change her plans but expects you to change yours ???  Asshole move on her part. Mom can either start asking before hand or suffer the consequences of her selfish inconsiderate behavior.  Honestly after the mom treated you,  you would be justified in refusing to watch your sister ever again.  Tell mom how insulting and rude her behavior was and if she wants you to babysit in the future she will have to give you advance notice.  If she does not then your answer will always be no. She will then have no excuse to treat you this way again. Set boundaries and demand she respect you or no babysitting. Up to you.  Be walked all over and made to feel guilty when it is not your fault or don't.  Act like a child still under your moms control or act like an adult.  All up to you.", "Why didnt she hire a sitter? NTA. Your mom has options - aka people she can hire and pay to do the sitting.", "NTA - And honestly any time she last minuted me (unless for emergency or unforeseen circumstances) I wouldn't be able to do it. They need to learn that your aren't just auto babysitters that will drop everything. Your parent's need to ask if you can do it with plenty of notice. She should have asked you and your sister before she bought the tickets. Not buy them, and then a week before they have to go ask for you to watch her.", "Your mom can\u2019t cancel her own plans, but you should cancel yours? Nope. NTA.", "NTA.

Siblings are not default babysitters that have to drop everything to let your parents go have a good time.", "Nta", "NTA\nDon't be an idiot.  You and your sister need to stop dropping everything for your mother.  She's capable of buying tickets in advance, she's capable of organising someone to look after your step-sister. What are the plans for when your stepsister can no longer be cared for by your parents? It sounds like your mother feels sorry for herself and expects everyone else to do whatever she demands", "NTA don\u2019t feel guilty that you already had plans made well in advance. Your mother should take a lesson from that.", "NTA. You both have your own lives, and she needs to stop being cheap and pay for someone to look after her. I'm willing to bet she's expecting one of you to take her in when they pass away.", "NTA Her lack of planning does not constitute an emergency in your part. Stick to your guns and keep this a boundary. You are allowed to have a life. Have a great trip.", "NTA.  The only way to get her to give you advance notice is to do exactly what you're doing.  Why should you change your plans due to the late notice when you would have been fine with it if you had notice?  She's in the wrong.  You are not.", "NTA. Your mom should long ago have made plans for assistance with your stepsister in lieu of always relying on you and your sister. Someone that she can call not only for situations like this but for respite. However, that said, she would also have to give that person notice. Last minute doesn't work - and it merely inconveniences everyone.\n\nNeither you or your sister are selfish for having a life, and not being able to drop everything for your mom at short notice.", "Your mom is not the T A for desperately wanting a break. And if people went to hell for not planning for contingencies, we'd ALL be there.

You get that right?!?  Why are you letting her guilt trip you?", "NTA and stop feeling bad for something that isn't your fault. You have told your mom to let you know about watching your step sister with more time so you can plan it better and she refuses to do so and then guilt trips you for it. Your step sister is your moms responsibility not yours, If she can't plan well enough to have someone babysit while she's out then she needs to face the consequences so that maybe in the future she will actually plan like she needs to. If she doesn't then let her deal with the consequences. YOU DONT OWE YOUR MOTHER ANYTHING and for her to act entitled to your time is ridiculous. Good luck and i hope you make her face the consequences", "NTA \n\nFree advice you didn\u2019t ask for: Stop explaining *why* you can\u2019t do stuff. Your mom doesn\u2019t really think you\u2019re allowed to say no to her about this, the reasons don\u2019t matter. The more you justify and explain, the more it seems like it\u2019s negotiable. Don\u2019t do it, and from now on say \u201cI\u2019m not available, sorry\u201d without adding reasons. In your shoes I\u2019d form a union with your other sister and be \u201cunavailable\u201d\nfor the rest of 2023. \n\nYour mom & stepdad (whose daughter this also is, I assume?) need to find reliable, consistent care for her so that they can do things like concerts. They bought the concert tickets not really having a plan in place because they assume they can guilt you and your sister. Guilt trips only work if you let them.", "NTA.

And stop explaining.  Just say, \u201cSorry mom, I already have plans or you are working. (And you do not need to tell her your days off either).  If only you had asked me before, I could have marked that day on my calendar.  Rinse, lather, repeat.   Also, maybe look up respite care for you parents or providers who will babysit someone disabled.  Give them a list.  They have choices.  They choose not to use them.  And if you have not had that discussion as of yet, I suggest you and your sister do so now between yourselves and then have a talk with your parents.  What happens if they go anywhere and do not make it back home?  Have you discussed your sister\u2019s future care?", "Don\u2019t fall for the guilt trip. What kind of concert is that anyways to warrant 12 hours, unless some kind of festival? I\u2019m sure she can find a care service for situations like these.\n\nNTA", "NTA - you are completely right to tell your mother no.  You don't need to justify your reasons, but even if you did, you have completely legitimate reasons!  You have things you have to do and you have appointments you need to keep.  You are not available to babysit for TWELVE HOURS so they can go to a concert.  \n\nIf your mom is truly in a bind, she can hire a babysitter.\n\nAnd let me put this out there.  Your mom will continue to drop things like this on you and your sister at the last minute because you always cave and do it.  Start telling her no.  It'll be uncomfortable and awkward for a while at first, but she'll eventually stop asking.", "It is kind if you ease the burden of taking care of a disabled family member from your parents from time to time, but your (step) sister is not your responsibility.\nYou and your sister should set clear boundaries. Your mom can ask you to watch your stepsister, but you should always have the right to say no without owing an explanation. If she makes plans, she should arrange for a caregiver as soon as possible. NTA", "NTA , YOU CAN SAY NO AND DON'T FEEL GUILTY", "Every time you or sister cancel your plans to do a favor for your mom (let\u2019s reframe it from taking care of your stepsister, because your mom has other valid options on how to do this, and I bet the fact that it\u2019s your stepsister contributes to your sense of guilt), but every time you drop everything and help mom out of a problem of her own making, it just reinforces that it\u2019s ok for it to happen. Why should she change if nothing is forcing her to? Actions speak louder than words - you can complain and ask for things to be different, but you\u2019re still going along with it. \n\nIt\u2019s a good thing you didn\u2019t have the option of cancelling your plans this time because something needed to disrupt the system you guys have found yourself in. Take this opportunity to set boundaries: you are happy to help out with stepsister (for non-emergencies) IF AND ONLY IF mom gives you a reasonable amount of notice (and be very clear on what is reasonable and what is not) AND you are available at the time. I would also set up some limits on how often you guys are willing to be caregivers both currently and down the line. Sounds like parents take you guys for granted and don\u2019t plan ahead, so I highly doubt they\u2019ve got long term plans for your stepsister apart from putting it on you and sister, which is not fair to any of you. \n\nYour parents will definitely push back over any limitations you and sister set, so be prepared to be firm. It\u2019s like little kids testing boundaries, it gets worse until it gets better, but it only gets better once they know they can\u2019t push past it. \n\nYou and sister should also determine your boundaries together and agree on them ahead of time so parents can\u2019t take advantage of either of you individually, and so you can support each other. \n\nAnd put it in writing. Email or text the parameters so no one can argue they misheard or forgot. And refer back to them as often as needed. Don\u2019t give other reasons (that parents can argue with) and don\u2019t apologize. You aren\u2019t doing anything wrong by having reasonable boundaries with your parents. You and your sister are doing more wrong to yourselves, your own families, your stepsister, and your parents by NOT having reasonable boundaries established. \n\nThis is tricky stuff. Simple =/= easy. Strongly suggest therapy to help support you at this time. It\u2019s hard to be objective when it comes to family, and ultra hard to break longstanding patterns. But you can do this. The sooner the better. Best wishes!!! And enjoy your vacation!!!\n\nETA: NTA", "Not your kid, not your problem. You have a full plate. Make no your final answer and no more rebuttals. NTA", "It seems that you and your sister are quite willing to watch your sister, if you have enough notice. You have told your mom repeatedly that you need more notice. She needs the pain of not getting her way, because she waited until the last minute, to even consider changing. After the concert, which you should not babysit for, you and your sister need to have a come to Jesus talk with your mom.\n\nJust because two of her three daughters are not disabled does not mean she is entitled to your time, for free, whenever she wants. This child has known needs, there are services she is entitled to. Why is her father not arranging care for his daughter. Where is her mother and all of his and her mom's family in helping with this girl( since you call her step sister). Why does all the helping fall in her stepmom's kids? What is the long term plan for this girl if she is unable to live on her own? Have they set up a fund to pay for her needs? Even if you and your sister are willing to take her in, it will be an expense.", "NTA\n\nWho's child is this?

Are there no services available they can use? Or is it just because they like the \"free\" option that their _other_ kids have? Genuine question as I really don't see why this is a \"it's either of you or nothing\" type arrangement, especially for things clearly they know about months in advance.", "NTA you owe no apology for someone else's selfish bad planning. Have a great holiday!", "Why in the heck are you feeling guilty? She knew you were busy, you said no. Enough said.", "Unless you start saying NO in situations like this and sticking to it then things will never change!", "NTA. You were right. Why did she wait last minute to make plans? Even a heads up as a back up plan.\n\nDon't feel guilty. She's demanding you rearrange everything for her thats incredibly selfish.", "You are not selfish. My mom is like this and she doesn't realize how rude it is. You can't expect people to cancel/drop their prearranged plans for YOUR prearranged plans when you give them no notice.\n\nYour mom has known about this concert for months, and waited until the very last minute to ask for help with your stepsister. That complete neglect of her own responsbilities is HER problem. Your stepsister is your mom's responsibility, your mom made plans months ago knowing she would need care, and SHE decided not to ask until the last minue. She created this situation, SHE IS THE ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE for having no care for your stepsister - not you. Your mother should be incredibly grateful that you and your sister are usually so willing to help, many others would not. But that doesn't mean that she can disrupt your whole life by not giving you enough notice. I would ignore her comments, ignore her attitude and just continally repat the following to her, over and over again: \"I am happy to help you when you give me enough notice. If you don't give me enough notice, I can't guarantee that I'll be available. If it's something important, it's up to you to make sure I know well in advance or I can't help.\" That's it. She made the choice to wait until the last minute, and this situtation is her own fault.\n\nIt's not a very strong boundary to place - to say you need notice. It's like the BARE MINIMUM of consideration for her to give you some notice before asking for something like this. Stick to the boundary.", "NTA  Why on earth do you feel guilty?!?

No more dropping everything last minute. You need *at least* a couple of weeks' notice unless it's a true emergency.\n\nYou need to set boundaries *now* and stick to them.

You really need to hold your boundaries every time, like you did in this situation. I would encourage your sister to as well. \n\nAlso, you don't need to keep apologizing or explaining yourself. You're an adult with your own life. It's not your responsibility to provide free babysitting to two people who refuse to pay for help. They are being manipulative (calling you a selfish, entitled brat) and passive aggressive (\"yeah, thanks a lot\"). I would not do favors for people who treated me this way.

My boyfriend and I have our own place. My sister (24F) works a lot too and also has her own place with her husband. \n\nMy mom has an annoying habit of asking my sister and I for favors with very little notice. Both of us have dropped everything and cancelled our plans because my mom needed us to watch our step sister. We have asked her so many times to give us enough of a heads up to avoid making conflicting plans. She won't listen. \n\nMy step sister lives with my parents. She's disabled (physically as well as mentally), and can't be left home by herself. \n\nNext week, my boyfriend and I are going on vacation. I only have one weekday off before then, and it's filled with appointments that I need to go to before vacation. \n\nLast week, during Thanksgiving, my mom asked my sister and I if one of us could watch my step sister this Thursday (my day off), from noon to midnight because she and my step-dad are going to a concert. I told her I have appointments that day, and still have to get up at 5 am the next day for work. My sister said she *could*, but would need to change around some plans, and advocated for me saying that I work early the next day. \n\nLast night, my mom called me and said I'm her last hope. My sister has the flu and can't babysit. I told her that I'm really sorry, but I have appointments that I *need* to go to before going out of town next week, and that it's my only day to do it, also that I still work early the next day. I told her that I would have made my plans around that day if I'd known ahead of time, maybe like when she bought the tickets *months* ago. She got mad that I wouldn't just cancel my plans for her. I apologized a lot and all she said were things like, \"yeah, thanks a lot.\" \n\nSince then, I've been feeling so guilty. I'm trying to figure out how to rearrange my day so that I can help her out, but nothing is going to work. I feel selfish for not dropping everything to help. I feel like an asshole.
