I will no longer be bringing separate food in for my kid.

They're right. The child is going to be upset that he can't have what his friends have, and most daycares can't afford the snacks you prefer due to the number of mouths to feed. \n\nEdit: Also, for those unfamiliar with how snack time at most daycares works, they don't just supply blind access to everything. It is portion controlled (at any decent childcare facility). I see a few comments stating that OP needs to find new childcare, now knowing that this will be standard for most affordable options", "[removed]", "YTA, daycares gotta feed and take care of all the kids. Unless he's eating only junk 24/7, he's fine. You're already setting him up to have an unhealthy relationship with food", "YTA. Your child will survive eating perfectly normal snack foods.

Don't expect this one to persuade your kid to eat carrot sticks when the other kids have crackers.", "Let the daycare do it\u2019s thing.", "NAH\n\nIf you want different snacks there, either donate non-perishables or start a parent fund for it.", "NAH.  It just seems like a mismatch between you and the daycare.  Ultimately you need to decide if the snack issue is bigger than the benefits that lead you to place your child their in the 1st place and move on if they are not.", "NTA if you let it go but Y. T. A. If you keep pushing it. I was you and I just had to let it go, daycares simply can't cope with customized requests from every parent, there was one here recently specifying that her child had to have a different nap time. If you are that picky you need to get a private nanny. Also many daycares try to keep the budget down to be affordable for other parents and unfortunately fresh food these days is simply pricey. Plus, Goldfish aren't that bad.", "Finally someone who admitted they were in the wrong", "NTA! I work in a school and some parents have restrictions for their kids.

It sounds like they are giving small, easy to gum and swallow foods to babies who are learning to eat safely while one or two teachers try to watch all the kids at once.  The small amount they are getting isn\u2019t going to do any real damage. You still feed good foods at home.", "Abandon this issue or be prepared to have a reputation as a mom. These daycare workers have clearly tried to accommodate your ask but if your kid doesn\u2019t want it or actively seeks the other snack; what are they suppose to do? Also other parents clearly don\u2019t have an issue as no one else provides separate snacks. If you really want to reduce the snacks; you could offer to bring in fresh fruit or similar for all the children some days so the workers don\u2019t have to keep separate or exclude your kid from normal snack time.", "NTA\n\nUnfortunately, while not unreasonable I don\u2019t see it as something that is going to change due to budget. \n\nI don\u2019t see anything wrong with putting out feelers to see if other parents feel the same way and pool together funds for fruit as snacks if the facility won\u2019t provide them. \n\nAlso, is this daycare infant specific? Or is your son in with older children as well who have a higher threshold for sugary snacks as they are bigger?\n\nYou could go the route of telling the staff you provide your snacks for a reason and don\u2019t want him eating cookies and crackers full stop. Won\u2019t make you popular as tantrums are probably going to occur, and there is the chance your son might forgo snacks all together", "NTA, however to assign specific snacks for preferences (not allergies) is burdensome to the daycare.  As well as keeping your items stored.  I get that this isn't how you wish to feed your child, but you are also expecting others to care for him while you are working.  I would look into being home more, finding a new place, or accepting that the daycare is feeding multiple children and he's going to eat some crackers.", "Soft YTA. Not everyone can afford those 'better' snacks and while some may be able to, others may be relying on the cheaper (and maybe not as healthy) alternatives. \n\nI understand wanting your child to eat healthy but the saying goes, \"everything in moderation\". Thinking that junk food is entirely bad and should be avoided is a fantastic route to E.D.s (speaking from experience) \n\nAnd yes, I understand that your child is 11 months old but remember that kids learn FAST and no one wants their child to be the one hoarding junk food later in life because mom said \"it's bad and they shouldn't have it\"", "NTA but you might need to look for another daycare. I worked at some point for a facility (daycare, Kindergarten, elementary school) and they were not allowed to have sweets etc. they only gave out vegetables, fruits, and something like corn puffs etc. But it's definitely hard to find a facility like that. The thing with yours is that, if they have 10+ kids, which they likely have it's difficult for them to probably prepare and give your child different snacks. I would still try to ask for it and just bring cut fruits and veggies etc.and yes I would also talk to other parents. If more parents talk about it and maybe talk together to the facility leader, you might be lucky.", "YTA and an annoying one at that. Your child is not \u201cliterally an infant\u201d and snacks during the week is not the end of the world. Feed him your hippy snacks the rest of the time.

But as a childcare worker it\u2019s especially hard to make sure only one kid eats a specific food . Especially when eating is a social thing and you\u2019re controlling 10 or so more kids . Maybe this isn\u2019t the environment for your kid .", "NAH. At 11 months, it shouldn\u2019t be an issue to feed your kid what you send for him, but it is tough on the staff to try to accommodate 1 kid with special food. There\u2019s either going to be an issue of your kid wanting to eat what he\u2019s seeing others eat (junk food is marketed towards kids and just looks more fun in shape & color than most healthy snacks) or they\u2019re going to want to know why they can\u2019t have what he\u2019s having. Depends on the age range of the kids, but I understand and definitely tried to keep our kids away from junk food when they were that young and still struggle to do so now that they\u2019re toddlers. Unfortunately there is a shockingly large percentage of parents who are fine with giving their infants soda in a bottle and whatever sweet and salty snacks that they eat themselves as soon as they can hold and gum or chew them. Best of luck!", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nit is unreasonable to expect them to have that drama every day just to cater to you - so unless you find a way to make your kid eat the stuff you send with him without grumbling when everybody eats something he likes better, you will have to accept what they feed the kids, or find other daycare options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Do you think it would be annoying if I reach out to the other parents to see if they want to collaborate to send in more whole food snacks?\" .. they might allow it if you ORGANIZE it and pay for it.

Your concern and request are understandable, but the day care workers are also understandably telling you that bringing your own snacks isn\u2019t working. I\u2019d stop for now and look for places that serve snacks you\u2019re ok with or where parents provide the snacks. Our son went to one where parents took turn providing snack for a week for the whole class. It was a mixed bag but on the whole probably better quality/fresher options overall and it was fun for the kids when they were a little older (but not gonna lie, a total pain in the ass when it was your week ha ha). Good luck.\n\nEdit - clarity", "Nta. Schools have to navigate food allergens and diet plans. You\u2019re not the first parent or the last to make requests of this nature. As long you\u2019re making those snacks, they should be given. You\u2019re not an annoying crunchy mom. Goldfish, crackers and cookies have almost no nutritional value and honestly shouldn\u2019t even be in a small child\u2019s diet but that\u2019s me. \n\nMy question is what are they even serving junk foods? A lot of schools don\u2019t serve those kind of foods and so avoid them. I would change day care bc yes food habits are LIFE long habits. Healthy food habits should be encouraged especially when young.", "You\u2019re definitely NTA. \n\nYou pay the daycare for a service and that is to make sure your child is properly taken care of. \n\nIf that means you want him to be eating healthy snacks and not a bunch of garbage that\u2019s filled with endless dyes and additives, then they should be more than accommodating. \n\nSigned,\nA Fellow Crunchy Mama \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb", "INFO Are they giving your son the standard snacks even though you have provided another snack? Or are they just telling you that he didn't eat what you provided but they didn't give him the other food?", "Your baby apparently wants to eat the same thing as the other babies in daycare. That seems odd to me - I've never known babies pay all that much attention to what other kids are doing. You put the baby in the high chair, put some food in front of the baby, and they may or may not eat it.\n\nBut this is part and parcel of sending your kid to daycare. There are almost no daycares that are going to serve the children hand-knitted granola. The daycare is a package deal - if you don't want it, then you need to make different childcare arangements for your kid, or have a parent stay home with him or something.\n\nIf you have friends who are also \"crunchy moms\", then perhaps you'd all like to collaborate on childcare or something?\n\nYTA", "NTA", " YTA.

General recommendation is no added sugar until at least 1 preferably 2. Definitely not ideal for an 11 month old. I'd explore other options for childcare. My kiddo has a couple day a week preschool.

It doesn't sound like a huge deal but when you're dealing with several young kids at once in this sort of setting the additional time and attention needed can actually be a lot more of a burden than you'd think (i used to nanny and work at a daycare). If a knife is required there may actually be restrictions on whether something sharp enough is even allowed in the littles room - so to prep they may need to send someone outside of the room to do it. \n\nAdditionally lots of fruits aren't shelf stable and need to be refrigerated before serving. Not all places will be able to accommodate the space or have a large enough one in the room so even making snack time happen might require someone leave. Sticking one kid's baggie in a mini cooler or fridge is a lot easier than a full tray or room of kids' snacks. \n\nOne thing that might help though that I've used with kids I worked with and my niblings is using fruit cutters - basically smaller cookie cutters and fun shaped presentations. Chunks of mango? Boring they'd rather have the cheezits. But cut the mango like a porcupine and send it in complete with two raisin eyes ? The coolest!! Who wants plain old sad apple slices when you could have some goldfish? But Apple stars and hearts? So fun! Might help with kid not fussing as much and always wanting to eat what the other kids are having since his will be so much more fun and zany!", "Yeah, other people are talking about portion control and learning but the kid is 11 months old. They eat (or don\u2019t eat) what is put in front of them. There\u2019s a huge difference between teaching a kindergartner that cakes at birthday parties are a sometimes food and giving a baby sugar literally no one needs 3 times a week.", "So, at a lot of daycares, at least in my experience, nutritious and more filling snacks tend to be given for AM snack. PM snack is meant to be something small and quick to keep kids full until dinner, but not so full that they don't eat dinner.\n\nAlso, kids are growing very quickly at this age, and some carbohydrates as part of an overall balanced diet really won't kill them. Denying kids food that their peers have will cause them to have an outside interest later on-nothing like the allure of the forbidden. \n\n[Here](https://meaningfullliving.com/making-all-foods-fit-how-to-handle-dessert/) [are](https://plantbasedjuniors.com/incorporating-sweets-in-a-healthy-way/) [a few articles](https://myfamilynutritionist.com/how-to-offer-dessert-with-dinner-to-toddlers/) about presenting foods neutrally.

Why give kids the less healthy snacks when they're too young to know the difference?", "Also young tastebuds are extremely sensitive! Don\u2019t inundate them with sugar because other food will be less tasty as a result.", "It's fine. It is absolutely fine.", "Ok, there is an extremely easy alternative to giving a literal baby candy. I\u2019ve lived in other wealthy, industrialized countries and the amount of sugar in the American diet is ridiculous.\n\n\nETA: I see the downvotes but you know I\u2019m right.", "You learned from this experience, your child will be better off as a result", "I taught a class last year. Once of the parents got all judgmental about the snacks we provided and said she and the other parents would like to provide snacks.\n\nSo we gave them the parameters we were required to work with: nothing squishy or messy or juicy. Nothing that got dipped or sauced. Must be in single serve containers. No tree nuts or peanuts (one student had allergies). No drinks that had to be poured; boxes or small sized water bottles only. Nothing that required refrigeration. Nothing that had to be prepped by the adults.\n\nThe parents ended up providing the exact same snacks we gave them: things like goldfish and pretzels and cheezits, all of which are actually pretty healthy and come in single serve packages.\n\nCarbs are not inherently bad: growing children actually need a lot of calories (and none of these kids had any extra weight to be concerned about) and these snacks fit the bill.", "Daycare teacher here! Firstly I think NAH, I can't speak for every daycare but the one I work at, the kids get snack time twice a day and usually for snack it's crackers/animal crackers/string cheese/cheeseitz and sometimes bananas. Of course for some parents that's not ideal and that's totally respectable. I, for one, as a mom usually send my son with his own food but that's bc of his sensory issues. Either way as a teacher we never mind kids bringing their own food and try to be accommodating. That being said, those are what they get for snack but for meals the kids always get some type of protein, carb, fruit, and veggie. There is nothing wrong with sending your kid with a diff snack but I wouldn't get too hung up on it :)", "NTA dietary habits are learned early.  I\u2019d push the school to change the snacks they feed the kids.  They just getting junk.  Be nice if there was some nutrition involved in the food they give these tiny people!", "What daycare provides food? My grandkids only get what is sent by their psrents!", "YTA Feed him healthy foods at home and let him enjoy the fun snacks at daycare. The amount they give kids for snacks isn't going to hurt him.", "You're right that eating these foods in moderation is fine. But if they're served these foods every day they aren't eating them in moderation. Most days the snacks offered should be something healthier, like fruit.", "OP, 80% of folks on here have an unhealthy diet that they see as normal...for it is normal given them and all their friends eat it and the food industry sells it to them.  Most are overweight. (2/3 of Americans are obese or overweight).\n\n It IS junk food.  Too much sugar and Highly Processed ...which is what is killing folks, making them fat, screwing up their microbiome .\n\nYou can listen to the majority and think YTA ... or you can be THAT parent that contacts the others, sends out a poll and asks who would like their kids to have healthier snacks?  \n\nGet nutritionless food out of their diet. \n\nYou won't be popular if you overdo it ... but you can nudge the needle in the right direction.   \n\nAlso, don't cave to the 20 y olds on here  who haven't had their pizza and chicken nuggets catch up to them yet.  If you don't give your kid a healthy head start, who will?  I cringe when I see 8 y olds 20 pounds overweight.  I feel so sorry for them. They have lost the battle before they even got started.  \n\nFor the sake of your child, fight the good fight.", "YTA. My parents were the same. Your own issues with disordered eating is now going to be passed on to your child if you go down this path. It's all okay in moderation, don't go to the other extreme path of trying to keep your child healthy. Neither extremes are good.", "YTA (but I understand) My parents were the same. Your own issues with disordered eating is now going to be passed on to your child if you go down this path. It's all okay in moderation, don't go to the other extreme path of trying to keep your child healthy. Neither extremes are good. Definitely worth talking to someone and getting help for you so you're able to not go to the other extreme.", "I\u2019m so sorry that you bowed to the peer pressure and terrible advice in this thread. Not letting your kid eat junk food is one of the best ways of protecting them and ensuring they grow up healthy and happy.

No wonder there is an obesity and diabetes epidemic in young children. What a terrible start to life. NTA until I read your edit.", "Goldfish are the #1 cause of cavities in young kids. Don't let them snack on them all day. Brush your little ones teeth and they will be okay.", "I am guessing that the country all the y.t.a comments come from is the ones well known for its unhealthy food. Regularily giving sugar and processed food to a eleven month old sounds insane to me. The mothers I know only give breast milk at that age.

We had to adapt, and many centres have switched from prepping snacks/lunch to having parents bring them in! We eased up on other regulations from Covid but for many centres it\u2019s cost effective and allows resources to go towards buying play equipment, diapers and hygienic problems craft supplies (educators mostly get those supplies from their own pockets) we do what we can for each age group to have their needs met, and make their days go smoother  with infants it\u2019s honestly just getting them to transition from one point to another (lunch to quiet time or afternoon play to snack are the most difficult imo) sorry this is long and probably a bit off topic! Hope this might help give an idea especially with toddler classes like ops", "It sounds like they are accommodating her and giving him the snacks she sends but just also letting her know that he isn\u2019t really eating them", "That\u2019s what she\u2019s doing??", "NTA, since when are goldfish not junk processed crap? Literally orange. Brown rice is whole food. Not cheese crackers. I'm appalled.", "They\u2019re probably feeding their own kids that and enraged with guilt."]}
