And yeah, she's going to spend time spelling it out, but so do a lot of people. It's still not a Tragedeigh name though.", "Melody isn't super unusual where I live.  I've definitely known people named \"Summer\" and \"Melody\" and some other names with similar styles (Delaney, Petra, etc.)\n\nThe names that OPs sister had in mind, though I don't really see anything wrong with either, are much less common, though.", "Callum is not a common name in the US.  The only one I know of is Callum Turner from FBAWTFT.", "My 87 yr old neighbour Edith just died. It is an oldest of farts name.", "Oh FFS. Edith is a regular, ordinary name. Not everyone needs to be Claytonne Estheryxx", "\"Old lady\" names are *very* in these days.  There's a turnaround of about 100 years for names to come back and sound cool again. Edith was last popular in the 1920, so it's just about right. And I think \"Edie\" is adorable. I had a Great-aunt Edie, in fact. She was awesome. Died in the late '70s.", "Shiny!\n\nI wanted to name my oldest Malcom after Mal. It's a nice name and a cool character. Husband said no, so we found another name, lol.", "I prefer \"Edie\" as I had an Aunt Edie, but Eddie is cute too. Makes me think of AbFab. Although she was Edina, not Edith. Well, her name was originally Edwina, which is a *really* old-fashioned name, but she changed it to the more euphonious Edina.", "Really? It sounds upper-class British, or (regular) Scottish to me. But then I don't know anyone with the name in the US, just British people or British characters.", "...and Malcolm! I can't believe all the hate was reserved for Edith. I could never look at a baby boy and think 'He looks like a Malcolm'! Malcolm is your weird uncle in the brown cardigan with elbow patches.", "**Please** tell me you went with Jayne or Wash. lol", "I definitely had that theme song stuck in my head as soon as I read the name.", "Edith Wharton was awesome. Her books are so intelligent. And if you like ghost stories, she wrote some corkers. Including one that I--and plenty of other people--think is one of the best in the English language. It's called \"Afterward.\"  The \"afterward\" isn't what you think, either. It's one of those stories that you get to the end and shudder.  \n\n\nOoh, apparently her collection of ghost stories has been republished. I bought a copy back in the 80s(?).  \nhttps://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/edith-whartons-bewitching-long-lost-ghost-stories", "I did not expect that reference. That game is so surprisingly heavy, it took me months to finish.", "Love that game.  I replay it every so often.", "One of my best friends is named Gretchen, I think it\u2019s beautiful.", "I love Eddie as a nickname for my friend! It honestly fits their personality so well and I was so happy when a popular TV show had a female character on it who went by Eddie, I really think it\u2019s a cute nickname for a girl who is named Edith.", "I had a cat named Agatha. She was a queen. Named her after Agatha Christie, of course.", "Uh, that\u2019s my Uncle Bill.", "I wish, lol. Though he'd likely do washed up jokes. It's still too soon.", "Those were the daaaaaaaaaaays", "Edith went through so much shit, but I had such a hard time ever sympathizing because she brought so much of her misfortune on herself, and frequently hurt others in the process. Like with Marigold. Yes, it was an agonizing situation with no good answer, but how many people did she hurt because she couldn't make a decision and commit to it?", "I want someone in the comments to respond \"Bertha, such a beautiful name!\". LOL", "I might have to binge that now.", "I think the Bertha Butt Boogy song in the 70s killed off that name for good.", "My Mom always liked the name Bruce, but said she would never give it to a child (thank goodness, since she only had girls.) So my childhood dog's middle name was Bruce.", "I went to school with a girl named Gertrude, but everyone called her Trudy. She was a popular girl.", "I love that your dog had a middle name! Bruce is a great name for a dog and the fact that it was his middle name makes me giggle \ud83d\ude01", "NTA - Those are so normal...Edith on the other hand... did she come out 90?", "Your kids names are good. Idk what her problem is but if she has hurt feelings she earned them. NTA", "my personal opinion, naming kids words like \"summer\" and \"melody\" is juss pretty lame", "NTA. Everyone has a different idea of what is trashy. Clearly, for someone going for an Norah/Edith/Malcolm vibe, she thinks newer names are all trashy and that names that could have been in an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel are inherently classy. Has she seen some of the made up names & average names with stupid spellings people have been naming their children lately? Your kids have decent names that will not ever raise a red flag or an eye roll. She sounds like someone who is probably deeply insecure about how she presents to the world.", "I share a name with one your children. Ita not trasy. It isn't favorite name but it's not... trashy.\n\nNTA. \nAnd Edith while old school,  is a fine name. Both of my great grandmother's were named Edith", "Nta \n\nWtf names their kid EDITH....it's not 1923\n\nMelody is my eldest daughters name.\n\nShe called you a bitch cause you stood up for yourself.", "NTA. Girl own the \u201ctrashy\u201d names. They are beautiful and we can be in the same club. My grandmother hates my daughters name. Said it\u2019s too unique and she will get picked on about it. Her name is Amore and while I love her name the most important thing is that my daughter LOVES her name and never would want to change it.", "NTA. The names you picked are great. I considered Melody \ud83c\udfb6 but had a son so I went with something different \ud83d\ude03. Your kids names are not trashy. You didn\u2019t name your kids Garbage, Used coffee filters, Moldy Orange, Smushed Gold Fish Crackers or Last Fridays Pasta Primavera.  Block your sister until she pulls her head out of her ass. Picking on kids name is trashy.", "NTA. \n\nIf your sister is this obsessed with your kids' names 10 years after you started having kids she needs serious therapy. This is not about your kids' names.", "I... I do not know who hurt your sister but she needs therapy I swear. As a child I was picked on for my name and became very self conscious of it. Your kids names are lovely and I'm glad none of them have had problems like that. But having a family member say their names are trashy will make them self conscious and resent their names.\n\nI don't care if she's hurt, she's been hurting your kids talking like that. They are small innocent kids and she is an adult who should support them not make them feel bad for names they should be confident with. You're NTA, she is and I really hope your kids never heard her saying those things about their names.\n\nIf she continues like this block her on everything until she's ready to apologize. Actions meet consequences.", "NTA  What kind of adult attacks & insults children because she hates their names? I'm thinking she's weirdly jealous. But you had every right to defend your kids from her bad behavior.", "NTA\n\nShe called you a bitch for calling *her* a name? What does she think she was doing when she called you trashy?", "NTA. She sounds fun at parties.", "NTA What's wrong with your sister? She got to name her kids and you get to name yours. Period.", "NTA. Setting your kids up for failure would be naming them krxstxl, American dream, something like that", "NTA.", "She named her kid EDITH??? LOLOL!!! Projecting much?\n\nNTA. Block her for a few weeks and let her tire herself out.", "one of these is my name (callum) and i know a jonah as well. they\u2019re all pretty normal names i think", "Agreed.

Well, I certainly disagree. #TeamEdith", "That's the point it's  1923 name not 2023", "What do we think of Esther?", "My cat's name is Melody.

Truly thought it was a common spelling, but Alannah is actually a more popular spelling in the US, per the Social Security Administration (it barely cracks the top 1000, whereas Ilana doesn't at all).  \n\nIf the last name was something more common I would feel differently, but the last name is long, and starts with a letter that is pronounced like an entirely different letter. Personally, I would have gone with any first name that doesn't have a bunch of alternate spellings knowing my kid's last name was going to be such a bear.", "How dare you insult Everly. Everly is much better than old lady Edith.", "Chef on below deck sailing yacht just had this name last season - it just feels more European to me.", "stop trying to make fetch happen!", "I have a chicken named Gertrude.
