It falls in the same category as Bertha or Gertrude.", "It\u2019s an ugly name, that\u2019s all.", "It made me think of Malcolm in the middle. Which may be why I quite like that one.", "Also I know an Edith who goes by Eddie, and ngl, I actually am kind of jealous of the cool nickname\n\nI have a relatively normal but traditional name and there are cool nicknames for mine", "I have a distant relative named Nimrod, I'm 63", "What do you mean by \"indicating the sex of the person\"? and why is that a good thing?", ">even indicating the sex of the person. So much worse going around these days.\n\nwhat the hell is that supposed to even mean", "Im Scottish, there are TONS of Callums here!", "I know all of these names at least from books/tv shows as well (I\u2019m German so they aren\u2019t very common here xD) but they are not my taste (I prefer northern names/German names)", "I think of two people when I hear Edith. The one girl from Despicable Me, and a lady I new at the nursing home I worked at.", "I mean, it\u2019s still a good name. Just because it\u2019s old fashioned doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad. Not like \u201cEverleigh\u201d or some shit", "I have an old person named (literally, named after my grandma who was at least 80 when I was born). \n\nI hated it for a while as a teenager, went by my middle name which is gender neutral but more male celebs started having it so I was old and male. Moved to college and just went by my first name because I didn't have the energy to try and invent a new name. \n\nEmail is my primary form of communication, the odd call to discuss details but I much prefer email because then I know everything is writing. I'm also pretty formal in my writing out of habit of dealing with international clients who have excellent professional English (and 100% better conversation than me in any language) but could struggle when I used more casual slang/phrases. I also learned names are bullshit so it's just easier to be formal with everyone. \n\nNow, I love my old lady first name. People generally think I'm a little older lady, doing some admin. People are either really nice and match my formality or dicks send 1 line emails. \n\nI'm 30 and look younger. It's always fun seeing people's faces when they realize I'm little but I'm not old and know my shit. And I love how after meeting, all the nice people become more friendly and less formal and generally, we have a great relationship. \nThe dicks tend to ghost when they realize their short, ridiculous emails aren't being sent to a little old lady who doesn't know how her job works but carries on in the background so can be bullied by questions/requests. Ha, that's a no from me dawg. Byeeee.", "You realize kids grow up into adults and old people right? Most adults don't want childish names. Name them for their future.", "Eddie is like, the best nickname I\u2019ve ever heard for Edith though! But I\u2019m also all about defying traditional gender roles when it comes to naming.

There was a similar name that was common but that wasn\u2019t *my* name, darnit.\n\nI enjoyed being one of the few with the name and didn\u2019t appreciate it when every other kid suddenly had it. I was named after my grandmother.", "Mate I'm English where it'd be arguably more acceptable to name your child Edith but I still wouldn't. It's as ugly as it sounds and there's a reason it's dead. Naming a child Edith for their future won't come into play till they're in a nursing home and 5 other Edith's stand up when name called for drugs.", "/s, right? It's rather hard to tell apart subtle sarcasm from genuine feeling, nowadays.", "Actually, Edith was smarter than she appeared if you actually watched the episodes.", "Oh. I have not seen that show", "That\u2019s fair, but yes, absolutely sarcasm.", "That is true.  But, that developed and she came across as very flighty and confused. Especially in the early day."]}
