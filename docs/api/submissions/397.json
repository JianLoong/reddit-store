We told him one of the biggest rules was don't mess with our stuff. We told him, for example we had a roommate previously who rearranged our whole kitchen without telling us. Please don't move our stuff around or do stuff to the house without talking to us.\nSince he's moved in he's not only tried to move our stuff around but makes comments how he doesn't like how we do stuff, how we can do it better and that he's going to change my bearded dragons daily routines.\n\nI've told him no multiple times, and had to put my foot down about not respecting me.\n\nWhich leads to today. I get home from my second job and my partner tells me his brother rearranged my lizards enclosure, even after he kept telling him to not do it. Brother in law told him he was being too uptight and moved everything around anyways. And put his basking rock away from his basking light.\n\nAs soon as I heard this I was fuming.

He doesn't know him or how to care for him and he absolutely should not be messing with his cage.  Also, why would you move the bearded dragon's basking rock AWAY from the light?! That defeats the whole purpose and takes away prime sitting for their favorite hobby!\n\nBIL had one job! Don't touch shit... He failed...", "NTA. No good deed goes unpunished. You give him a place to live at a highly discounted price and he turns into a jerk. I'd give him the boot or let him know you will be raising his rent to $500.", "NTA. It's not his house. It's not his dragon. If he continues his belligerent ways, boot his ass to the curb.", "You work to jobs to support his ass and he won\u2019t follow basic house rules?

You doing him a favor by allowing him to stay. He deserves every letter of your ultimatum.", "NTA. Tell him to pack his things and get out.\n\nAt the very least, triple his rent.", "NTA. my BIL was the same way when we let him move in with us. He rearranged stuff, ate all of my vitamins that I needed and that were expensive, acted like the place was his. He was rude too. It didn't end well. We ended up having to call the police on him because he wouldn't leave when we asked him to leave for disrespecting us for so long. He also never paid us once, when we had agreed that he'd pay rent. I can't remember what we agreed to, but probably only like $200 like in your situation", "NTA although you would be if you don\u2019t send that dude back to his mother\u2019s house. Who cares if he doesn\u2019t like his stepdad, not your problem. Your problem is that the guy is arrogant and will deliberately do things to annoy you and endanger your pets.", "NTA He either respects your stuff or he can go. That is not his house and not his stuff. Would he like it if you rearranged his stuff and acted the way he does? \n\nMaybe Do that for a whole day. Rearrange EVERYTHING of his and talk/act like he does. I mean down to rearranging the FOOD off of his PLATE! \n\nIf that doesn't do it, kick him you tried.", "NTA. But I\u2019d start locking the lizard cage now.", "NTA. The way I see it there are two choices:\n\n1) BIL can find somewhere else to live. Immediately.\n\n2) He can pay full market rent for his room, you can use that money to come up with an alternate solution for your belongings in the room he is occupying (including your dragon, excellent pet choice), and he can do whatever he wants to the room to the level a normal tenant can. \n\nIt's up to you and your partner whether you let him choose or you make the decision for him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He needs your housing not the other way around.

You call it \"his\" room but it's not, you've made it clear he has no expectation of privacy and you stomped back in to rearrange things.  It's reasonable to expect others to leave the arranging of other spaces alone, IMHO your restrictions about \"his\" space were unreasonable.\n\nPeople can say \"your house your rules\", I disagree.  Everyone needs a safe space of their own.  Personally, I think he made a mistake in taking you up on your \"offer\".   He's 10 years older, why doesn't he have a place of his own.", "YTA", "I've been thinking the same thing. We've also been running into issues of him not watching his kids when they're here either. The kids have let our pigs loose in our house twice now, because brother in law wasn't paying attention to them", "Exactly! I've argued with him before about the purpose of the basking rock and light, because he does not think it's that important", "Its definitely a combination haha I also absolutely hate their step dad and refused to go to their moms house anymore because of him. But now I'm seeing brother in law isn't much better", "I dont understand where all their audacity comes from!", "\u2026 and the pig cages.", "The obvious answer to this question is because he is unable to get a place of his own. He's 10 yrs older than them but went from living with his parents to moving in a sibling. He has kids but doesn't actually watch them when they visit, at his siblings house. He doesn't get to complain about living arrangements when he can't support himself to have his own place to live. At $200 a month you would think that he would save up to get a place and not rock the boat. But your right he should move out since he can't respect the rules that were set forth, you know don't touch the lizard enclosure.", "Its funny you say this because I've never touched anything in his room and he can decorate it and do whatever he wants with it. The deal with living here is that my lizard has to be in there (because that was his room initially and dont have another room to put him in) and not to mess with his enclosure.\n\nHe doesn't have his own place because he's made lots of poor decisions \n\nAlso \"assigned room\"? We have one extra room in our house to offer him?", "What a jerk. I think your home would be more harmonious with him gone.", "He is a dad?", "He clearly doesnt even understand basic care.....", "But you did march in the room to arrange things back.   In any case, he's paying to rent a room.  I think he should move.", "Yeah, he has 3 kids that visit after school Monday and Friday", "NTA. Make him leave now. He is taking advantage of you and your kindness.", "Dad of the year right there!"]}
