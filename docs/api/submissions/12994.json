{"id": 12994, "submission_id": "11zmf91", "title": "AITA For Telling My Daughter She Can\u2019t Move 1,000+ Miles Away To Live With Her Girlfriend?", "selftext": "A friend at work pointed me to this to get some more advice/points of view on my situation.\n\nI (46F) am the mother to two wonderful children, Andrew (16M) and Nicole (21F). Nicole was very bright as a child and excelled in her classes, and she headed into college with a plan to get a Master\u2019s at least. I never had to worry about her doing well or hitting milestones, but the last few years have been very surprising. She became a bit withdrawn in her teen years, more so than I realized until now, and after her first year of college she suddenly moved out from a relative\u2019s home and got her own apartment. Then, after her second year of college (last May) she told me and her father (58M) that she was dropping out and might return in a year, but wasn\u2019t sure, and that she was incredibly stressed and depressed and had been for years. It felt like it was coming out of nowhere. \n\nLast fall she got a full time job and started talking about how she was happy and finally in a good routine and that she loved working. I was glad things were at least going well for her now, but still hoping she\u2019d return to college soon. One of the biggest recent bombshells she dropped on me though was a month ago when I drove to visit her. We went out for lunch, and we started talking about this friend (25F) of hers. Eventually, my daughter admitted to me that she was a lesbian, and that she and this girl had been dating since January and that she FLEW TO MEET HER WITHOUT TELLING ME OR HER FATHER! Mind you, she flew over 1,000 miles to see this girl that she had NEVER MET and had only called and video chatted with for a few months. I was shocked and angry, but all I did was gently scold her for not telling me, but that I\u2019m glad she\u2019s okay and that she had a good time with her girlfriend. I\u2019m very new to this whole thing with my daughter, as I thought she was interested in men, but I\u2019m willing to support her because I love her. \n\nThe problem now is that she told me earlier this week that she intends to move within the next year and a half. She says it may be sooner rather than later because things are changing with her girlfriend\u2019s living situation and she wanted to give me a heads up. I told her absolutely not, that she can\u2019t move in with someone she\u2019s only been dating for a couple of months, especially not when she\u2019s moving several states away. All of her family is HERE, including me and her father and her brother, and her three living grandparents. I told her she\u2019s too young and she can\u2019t move that far away from us just for a girl. She told me that regardless of her girlfriend, she\u2019s been wanting to move far away for years and that her girlfriend\u2019s state was on a list of potential places. She said she loved being there when she visited and can\u2019t wait to go back. She says I\u2019m being unreasonable by asking her to stay and that she hates it here and feels like she \u201ccan\u2019t be herself\u201d.\n\nAm I being the a-hole here? I don\u2019t think she\u2019s old enough or mature enough to leave.\n\nEdit because someone asked- my daughter didn\u2019t ask for money. She almost never asks for money, she\u2019s like her father in that way. She\u2019s almost completely financially independent. I have her on my health/dental insurance to help her out, my mother pays her monthly phone plan because she insisted on doing something for my daughter, and my daughters grandfather on her father\u2019s side pays her car insurance, and my daughter goes to her father when she has car troubles because he has a lot of experience with cars. My daughter takes care of all her other needs on her own.\n\nEdit- my child\u2019s father is NOT my husband. We never married. We have not been together since she was born. I would have left him earlier had I not become pregnant. I regret being involved with him because he is why I was introduced and became addicted to drugs. I do not regret my daughter. Please stop calling me a homophobe. I support my daughter. I am just apparently ignorant to some things about being gay.\n\nEdit- I am no longer talking about or answering questions about my addiction. Most of you are making baseless assumptions and disgusting accusations and I won\u2019t entertain them. I tried my best to be a good mother and get clean. That\u2019s that. I may not have been the best person to have custody of her as a child, but neither was her actively abusive father who stalked, abused, manipulated, and intimidated me the entire time I\u2019ve known him.", "created_utc": 1679582422, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zmf91/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_she_cant_move_1000/", "score": 7985, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It seems like you don't know much about your daughter's personal life. And that's okay, because she doesn't need to share, she's not a teen living under your roof. The more you butt in and tell her what she can and can't do as an adult, the less you're going to see her. Have you considered that the reason she wants to leave at all is to get away from the restraints of her hometown and family?", "Of COURSE YTA. Your daughter is an adult. Butt the fuck out. It sounds like she was depressed because she was hiding her sexuality from you. Live your own life, not hers. By the way, YTA.", "She's 21, so of course she can move. What a ridiculous position to take!\n\n>she FLEW TO MEET HER WITHOUT TELLING ME OR HER FATHER!\n\nAnd? Your daughter is an adult, I'm pretty sure she's doing all sorts of things on her own without telling her parents.\n\n>All of her family is HERE\n\nAnd she, apparently, doesn't want to be here. Hasn't wanted to be here for a long time.\n\nYes, YTA, and only getting more so with your additional protestations.\n\nedit: \"she's 21\"", "Yta, she\u2019s an adult and she has respected you enough to tell you.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame that you weren\u2019t close enough to get to see that she was depressed when you thought she was all good but keeping her close won\u2019t make up for that. Fully embrace and support her because it sounds like  she\u2019s happy, stay on her good side and hopefully she will bring you along in her new life", "> I told her absolutely not, that she can\u2019t move in with someone she\u2019s only been dating for a couple of months\n\nShe's an adult. She absolutely can. \n\nYTA.", "YTA.\n\nYou can have an opinion of the matter, but that's all it is - your opinion.  I'm not surprised she wants to get away from you - when she says she \"can't be herself\" she pretty obviously means that you are way too controlling and intrusive (just as you're being here).\n\nWish her well, tell her you'll always be there for her, invite her and her girlfriend to visit. Don't try and run her life, it will completely backfire on you.", "YTA. \n\nHey look, I get it. Her moving in with someone after a few months is scary. It may not work out. But she\u2019s an adult, and she\u2019s young. Maybe it works out for her, and if it doesn\u2019t, she\u2019ll learn from it. As a parent, you sometimes have to let go and let them figure things out. The best thing you can do is offer your stance but say that you will always be there for her. Maybe if you offered for her girlfriend to come visit for a bit so you can meet her? That might calm your worries.", "YTA. You don\u2019t get to veto another adult\u2019s decisions. \n\nYou aren\u2019t wrong to have concerns and to calmly express them, but you are wrong to say she can\u2019t do it.", "YTA, and I fully expect to see you posting in a year or two complaining about how you have no idea why your adult daughter has gone no contact with you.\n\nShe's an adult she doesn't need your permission to live her life as she pleases.", "YTA Your daughter is 21 and already living on her own. She's happy and excited about the direction her life is going. If things don't work out with the girlfriend, it still sounds like she's capable of taking care of herself.\n\nINFO: Is the area you live in a fairly conservative area? If you're in the US, is it a red state? If so, the fact that she's a lesbian was probably why she became withdrawn and did all the things that have surprised you. It's hard being queer in a conservative area, even if she's in a progressive city in a red state. I bet the girlfriend lives in a more progressive location. Now that she's finally out to you and you've been supportive in general, she feels more confident in her identity.\n\nSupport her happiness. If moving ends up being a mistake, it's a mistake she has to learn from.", "LOL. You are telling your adult daughter who has a full time job where she can or can't go? YTA. Stop trying to helicopter parent an adult and let her live her life.  Even if she's making a mistake, it's hers to make and learn from.", "YTA\nI get the concern. But she's legally old enough to make that choice for herself. And depending on your State, it may be unreasonable to expect her to stay. Many States are ramping up hate against LGBT people.", "YTA.\n\nIt\u2019s fine to have reservations about her moving to another state to be with a woman she hasn\u2019t been dating long, it\u2019s even fine to talk to her about those reservations but she\u2019s a grown adult and her choices are hers and hers alone to make. It sounds like she\u2019s got her shit together pretty well at such a young age and she\u2019s going to do what she wants.

She's 21. She definitely can do that. \n\n>I told her she\u2019s too young\n\nIn fact, 21 is not too young to make decisions about where she lives. \n\nYTA. You ain't gotta like it, but you do gotta accept that a 21 year old adult has the autonomy to choose where they live and with whom.", "YTA. Your daughter is an adult. You can\u2019t tell her she can\u2019t move and if you want to maintain a relationship with her you may want to stop acting like she\u2019s still a kid. \n\nAlso, she didn\u2019t have to tell you about flying off to meet this woman. I assume your daughter has friends. I bet they knew. \n\nTime to come to terms with the fact that your daughter is 21 and living on her own and that she\u2019s not asking, she\u2019s telling you she\u2019s moving.", "YTA. She is 21 and is financially independent. She gets to make her own life choices. You get to sit back, hope she is happy, and provide emotional support if needed.", "YTA. She is 21yo and doesn't need your permission to move.", "YTA She is 21 now and you need perspective - people move all the time. The days where everyone expects to live in the town of their birth surrounded by all their family are largely over. Most of us will move around, maybe come home to settle, maybe not. you\u2019ll Have a much better long term relationship if you focus on being the safe place she can always come back to if things don\u2019t work out or get rough than if you focus on limiting her options in life. 1) it won\u2019t work because she isn\u2019t a child and 2) she won\u2019t want to share with you or be around you because it\u2019s annoying", "YTA and you are shooting yourself in the foot. She's going to make her own decisions and all you have control over is whether she trusts she can reach out to you for support or not. \n\nIf you continue to treat her like a child and dismiss her choices for **her** life, she's just going to stop talking to you. Or potentially if she does end up in a bad situation, she won't feel safe coming to you for help because you pushed her away or she fears that you will only help if she allows you to take control of her life away from her. \n\nYou should be talking to her about why you feel so strongly about her choices like she's the smart and capable young woman you've raised her to be and not like she's too stupid or underdeveloped to comprehend the consequences of her actions.", "YTA - your daughter is an adult, and she is making independent adult choices. You have no right to control her or prevent her making those choices.", "YTA - She's an adult, she's not asking you if she can, she's telling you what she's planning. \n\nIf you want to maintain a good relationship with her, make yourself available to her. You can tell her your concerns, but you can't forbid her without pushing her away. If she DOES move and it doesn't work out, you want to make sure she feels safe and supported by you to reach out to you for help if she needs it. And also, that may be the plan a year + from now, but things can change in that time.", "I respect that as her parent you\u2019re concerned and don\u2019t want her to move away. I\u2019d be concerned too in your shoes but while you may be right about her maturity you are handling this completely wrong. She\u2019s your child but she isn\u2019t a child and you treating her like one is what makes YTA\n\nYou only have two real options here: Disagree with her choice but respect that it is her choice and let it happen or lose your relationship with your daughter.", "YTA. Please don't make the same mistakes that countless of parents make with ADULT children. Let her find herself because it has nothing to do with you. Many young adults take a break from college and only go back if they feel ready; but college is extremely expensive these days and not for everyone-- don't put her worth or your approval contingent on what YOU think is right for her life. If choices she is making surprise you, ask her about them! If you assumed you knew everything that was going on in her mind because she \"behaved well\" then you are likely pretty off. She is not a child, and now could be a great time to get to know who she is and who she is becoming without judgement. OR it could be a time you ruin your relationship with your daughter because you are still trying to control her. I know it all comes from a place of love, but love who she is, not who you want her to be.", "YTA for trying to tell her what she can and can\u2019t do as a fully grown adult. You can\u2019t make decisions for her anymore. \n\nWhile it\u2019s natural to have concerns, her choices are also no longer in your control. \n\nIt is better to support her through this move rather than risk alienating her. How you treat this situation may dictate how often she chooses to be available to visit in the future.", "YTA. You need to understand she\u2019s moving across the country to get away from you. You\u2019re incredibly overbearing, condescending, and I\u2019m pretty sure homophobic. You don\u2019t respect your daughter, you clearly aren\u2019t actively involved in her life, or these things would not have come as a shock. And to top it all off, you proved her exactly right when your response to her telling you these things was to FORBID her. As if you have any say in it at all.", "YTA - that\u2019s the judgement but I\u2019ve read your other comments and here\u2019s my take. Take it for what it is.\n\nYou had an addiction issue which caused your daughter to grow up faster than a normal child. But she is now an adult and has been for three years. \n\nYou also mention the period of her life where she was going through a tough time. It was probably because she was coming to terms with who she is. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t need your permission and you saying you don\u2019t want her to make a mistake is actually hindering her future growth. Mistakes define us and teach us lessons to build on later. If we go through life \u201cperfectly\u201d than we learn nothing. You became an addict. That was a mistake and you learned from it too, but you also taught lessons to your family during that time. \n\nFear is a funny thing but it can not keep us from growing. It can\u2019t keep everything from happening to us. \n\nAlso, family isn\u2019t everything. Friends can end up being family too. Let her explore the world, make friends, build her life and her foundation in her way. She will learn lessons, find ways to cope and be stronger.\n\nIf you really love her, always keep the door open so she can come back when and if she needs to. But how you are handling it now will assure the she keeps far away and visits very little.", "Maybe it\u2019s not the best decision, but you are incredibly overbearing. How old does she need to be to leave home?  She said in the next 18 months so she\u2019ll be 22 or 23? I left home at 17 for college. At 23 I started traveling for work. I was taking flights at least once a month to live in different cities for anywhere from a week to two months. No, I didn\u2019t move across the country for a significant other, but at least she will have a small support system with her. \nI\u2019m 27 and have lived long term in three different cities in the past decade. I feel like I was 21 like yesterday, and while I am certainly more mature now, I learned nearly everything by doing. *She will figure it out.* If you stop acting the way you\u2019re acting, she can always come home either to visit or for good if she runs into problems. YTA on this one.", "YTA \n\nShe\u2019s an adult and you don\u2019t get a say.\n\nPart of kids growing up is them making decisions that you don\u2019t want them to make or that you see as a problem. You just have to deal with it.", "YTA. Simple. She's an adult and can make her own decisions. I understand that this hurts you (my parents also weren't too happy when I moved 400 miles away), but that's life.\n\nIf you want to make sure to lose your daughter tell her that she cannot do this and that you are angry at her because of her selfish and childish behavior.\n\n(I had a giggle at your CAPITAL indignation. Mind you, she flew over 1,000 miles! Alone!!)", "YTA - Why do you think you have the right to tell her what she can or can't do? She's a 21 year old grown ass adult.", "YTA.  Your daughter is legally an adult, and therefore is fully within her rights to move if that\u2019s what she chooses.  There simply is nothing for you to prohibit.  You don\u2019t have to like her choices and you don\u2019t have to support them financially (although it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s asking for that), but you do have to respect her right as an adult to make her own choices.", "YTA. She\u2019s an adult, leave her alone.", "YTA. She\u2019s 21 and wants to live her life, you need to let her before you lose her forever", "INFO: Did she ask you to fund her moving or does she fully financially support herself?", "You need to let her her be..she's an adult now and can make her own decisions with or without you. She's been unhappy for a long time. She's figuring out what she wants and needs out of life. You might not understand it...but she still tried to share this with you. You need to step aside and let her go OP.  She's your daughter. You love her. Do you want to see her happy and settled or withdrawn and depressed?? Her choices are part of her growing and learning. As a parent you have to let her do this. Be a source of emotional support....don't let her growing up be your focus and cause you to act bitter and hurt. You can advise her... help her...make her aware of actual concerns to help prepare her...but don't block and stiffle her anymore......\n\nDon't be YTA OP...,... There's still time to change that.", "YTA\n\nShe'll be at or about at 23 by the time she leaves going by your testimony. She's old enough to do as she pleases.

Maybe she moves away and things don\u2019t work out, or maybe they do. Either way, she\u2019s an adult and it\u2019s very normal for people to move away even at 18 (what do you think people who go to university miles away do?).

It sounds like she wants to move to a more accepting/progressive area, and that\u2019s perfectly valid (even if the relationship isn\u2019t forever, which she seems to acknowledge). It sounds like she sees a brighter future there since she won\u2019t have to hide the fact that she\u2019s gay. This is a very real concern for people in certain areas, and you need to understand that if you want to have any chance of maintaining a relationship with her.\n\nYou never put 2 and 2 together in your post, at least not explicitly. It sounds like she became more withdrawn in her teens years because she realized she\u2019s a lesbian (I\u2019m guessing she waited to tell you as long as possible because she didn\u2019t expect you/your family/community to support her). All you said was you\u2019re \u201cvery new to this whole thing\u201d and you\u2019re \u201cwilling to support her because you love her.\u201d Maybe I\u2019m reading into it too much, but I think you should support gay people *even if* you don\u2019t love them or even know them.\n\nYTA. She\u2019s an adult. You have no right to dictate where she lives, especially if her choice makes her feel more accepted and happy. Why demand she lives in her own version of hell?

You can say that you worry about her moving in with someone she's been dating for a short amount of time. It's a fair concern but it shows that you understand that she is an adult.

If she is financially independent you have no right to tell her what to do.", "YTA. \"Can't\" is not how parenting works when your child is an independent adult. It's hard to let kids go, but it's essential for both of you that you see your child as an adult who is capable of making decisions. Will it be a mistake? Maybe or maybe not. She gets to make mistakes though. If you hold on too tight to your daughter, you will lose her.", "I knew YTA as soon as you said your daughter was 21.

Your daughter is a more or less financially independent adult aside from the insurances you mentioned. She is old enough to make her own moving, career, and romantic decisions. She is also not just planning to move one a whim if her projected timeline is a year and a half. \n\nIt is okay to worry, that is what parents do. Twenty one is still fairly young and inexperienced in the span of a lifetime but the way people become experienced is by living. It\u2019s entirely possible your daughter will move across the country and her relationship might not work out, as many relationships don\u2019t. It is also possible this could be the start of your daughter spending many happy years together with a woman she loves. Either way it\u2019s your daughter\u2019s risk to take. Love is worth risking a broken heart and the adventure of living in a new city is worth leaving home. \n\nAs her parent the best you can do is be loving and supportive of your daughter. Keep communication open, call and check in, let her know she can always talk to you. When she moves, go visit her if you can afford to. Invite her and the girlfriend to visit.

So you have two options:\n\n1) support her and maintain a relationship \n2) act like you are currently and lose her\n\nPick a lane, and if you choose option 2, don\u2019t come back here when your daughter goes no contact with you and expect sympathy.", "Pretty gigantic YTA I'm ngl\n\nYou are allowed to have your concerns but they were voiced in the worst way imaginable and this is only pushing her away even more.\n\nAlso, I think you fail to understand how depression works.", "You\u2019re not really an asshole, you\u2019re just a mom grasping onto your baby.

The only way to learn is to, unfortunately, make the mistakes.", "NTA, but you have to understand that your daughter has the right to move to another state and that there is nothing you can do to stop her.\n\nI understand your concerns as a parent. You are worried about her safety and well-being.

If her motivations to move are just to be with her new girlfriend... that's a bit trickier because they've only met in person once, and no matter how much they videochat, that's not enough to get a real sense of someone's character and how they truly are. If ai were you, I would support her in her decision, but also mention that she should try to live by herself first and date her new gf. Relationships can fail, and it would suck if they're living together and things don't work out between the two of them, and all of a sudden she finds herself all alone without a place to live.\n\nAll you can do is be supportive, let her find her own path in life. Guidance is good, threats and coercion are not. Trying to control her and telling her she \"can't do that\" will only damage your relationship with her.", "NTA, seeme like she just wants to move and picked the first girl that will take her. Definitely seems like an impulsive decision. If her issue really is depression then i think being far far away from her large, supportive family for a girl she just met isnt a good idea.

This isnt something to be mad at her for, just a poor decision on her part in a confusing time in her life.", "NTA-these are normal parenting concerns.

However, she sounds like she\u2019s all over the place and as a parent, it\u2019s reasonable you\u2019re concerned.  Can you take a moment, some deep breaths, and then try to sit down with her and express some concerns, help her figure out some plans? Reacting to her crazy with harsh demands isn\u2019t going to work in anyone\u2019s favor.", "NAH. Those are normal concerns for a parent to discuss, but she's an adult and can do as she likes. I'm assuming here she supports herself.\n\nI'm laughing at all the Y.T.A judgments here, as if no one in a family is ever allowed to express an opinion when someone is making life-changing choices after 3 months of dating.", "NAH. She is an adult. She can do what she wants to do. But I do think she is extremely dumb flying thousand miles to meet a someone she met online. That could have ended badly. Also moving in with someone you haven't really dated IRL is just a bad move. So is dropping out of college.

Nicole was very bright as a child and excelled in her classes, and she headed into college with a plan to get a Master\u2019s at least. I never had to worry about her doing well or hitting milestones, but the last few years have been very surprising. She became a bit withdrawn in her teen years, more so than I realized until now, and after her first year of college she suddenly moved out from a relative\u2019s home and got her own apartment. Then, after her second year of college (last May) she told me and her father (58M) that she was dropping out and might return in a year, but wasn\u2019t sure, and that she was incredibly stressed and depressed and had been for years. It felt like it was coming out of nowhere. \n\nLast fall she got a full time job and started talking about how she was happy and finally in a good routine and that she loved working. I was glad things were at least going well for her now, but still hoping she\u2019d return to college soon. One of the biggest recent bombshells she dropped on me though was a month ago when I drove to visit her. We went out for lunch, and we started talking about this friend (25F) of hers. Eventually, my daughter admitted to me that she was a lesbian, and that she and this girl had been dating since January and that she FLEW TO MEET HER WITHOUT TELLING ME OR HER FATHER! Mind you, she flew over 1,000 miles to see this girl that she had NEVER MET and had only called and video chatted with for a few months. I was shocked and angry, but all I did was gently scold her for not telling me, but that I\u2019m glad she\u2019s okay and that she had a good time with her girlfriend. I\u2019m very new to this whole thing with my daughter, as I thought she was interested in men, but I\u2019m willing to support her because I love her. \n\nThe problem now is that she told me earlier this week that she intends to move within the next year and a half. She says it may be sooner rather than later because things are changing with her girlfriend\u2019s living situation and she wanted to give me a heads up. I told her absolutely not, that she can\u2019t move in with someone she\u2019s only been dating for a couple of months, especially not when she\u2019s moving several states away. All of her family is HERE, including me and her father and her brother, and her three living grandparents. I told her she\u2019s too young and she can\u2019t move that far away from us just for a girl. She told me that regardless of her girlfriend, she\u2019s been wanting to move far away for years and that her girlfriend\u2019s state was on a list of potential places. She said she loved being there when she visited and can\u2019t wait to go back. She says I\u2019m being unreasonable by asking her to stay and that she hates it here and feels like she \u201ccan\u2019t be herself\u201d.\n\nAm I being the a-hole here? I don\u2019t think she\u2019s old enough or mature enough to leave.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

About 4 or 5 years later, he wanted to move to another state, and I refused to stop him, knowing he would again find himself wanting to come home. \n\nI've said all this to say, \"Let her go she sounds like she has her head on her shoulders, and you've done well with her.

Be supportive to your daughter so maybe she will trust you in the future to tell you about herself and her life. The last thing you want is to be cut out of her life. Tell her you love her.

I applaud you for accepting her, but please understand that she likely lived for years with the fear of you rejecting her for her sexuality.

Again, you ADULT daughter doesn\u2019t need your permission to move and the fact that you believe you\u2019re entitled to control her and tell her what to do is extremely concerning.

No I don\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t know this girl well enough at all, and she will likely have no way to support herself and be dependent on her own which is a bad spot to be in since she has no way to know if they are even people who can live together cohesively or worse if this girl is abusive. \n\nHowever, she\u2019s IS legally an adult, and she is going to do what she wants to do at the end of the day. You telling her no is going to do nothing but make her mad and make her feel like she needs to exert more control to show you that she\u2019s an adult. You are chasing her away faster with her actions.\n\nTbh what you should\u2019ve just done, is do what you did the first time around. Speak to her like an ADULT. Voice your concerns but tell her that you understand ultimately it\u2019s her decision and that you are just very worried for her. If something goes wrong you cannot likely afford to visit her let alone fund her to move back. You are worried she could get stranded up there with no way for you to help her. Ask if she would not be willing instead to get a job lined up and live by herself or with other roommates there FIRST so she can test the relationship at a closer distance. Frankly even if this is a good relationship she may ruin it by them trying to move to fast into it.\n\nYour response however is going to lead her to go anyways and then feel like she has to stick it out no matter had bad it gets. And that\u2019s not a good spot to place anyone in.\n\nThe other factor here is that she has made it clear she wants to move in general. You need to stop fighting that part of the equation.

I know people who tend to react to strong emotional situations with denial (my mom does this) so they can avoid all those feelings.

Of course this is all speculation.  \n\nRegardless, OP\u2019s daughter is an adult now. And OP\u2019s job as her mother is to support her.  A 21yo adult, unless handicapped in some way, is fully capable of going on trips without telling her parents and she doesn\u2019t need permission to move in with her girlfriend. Many young adults younger than 21 live several states away from their parents for college or whatever. \n\nMy advice to OP is to tell her daughter that she loves her and if things don\u2019t work out OP will always welcome her back with open arms. Keep the line of communication open in case she gets in a bad situation and needs help. Be her safety net. Once your kids reach adulthood, your role in their lives changes to more of a safety net and support system rather than an active parent. If you are having trouble accepting this transition due to your own grief and trauma, then that is something you need to work through on your own without holding your daughter back.\n\nEdit: OP also needs to be aware that her daughter was likely traumatized by the removal and because of this trauma and OP\u2019s own drug and abuse history, her daughter is more susceptible to drug addiction and abusive relationships as well.

LBD basically takes everything from you while leaving your family to grapple with a confused, angry person who looks exactly like you, but you don't know them, or love them anymore.\n\nWhile it is a different type of dementia, this is the horrible next several years (if that) that Bruce Willis' family has in store as he declines due to dementia. He will keep losing himself, and eventually will be completely unable to care for even his most basic needs. His family will mourn him in bits and pieces long before he dies. Their last memories of him will be unpleasant. His death will bring relief, and also guilt for feeling that way. Dementia, Alzheimer's, LBD, etc, are terrible, brutal diseases that are absolutely soul crushing for the families to endure.\n\nRobin Williams chose to end his life before he lost himself. I wish, for his and his family's sakes, that death with dignity/medically assisted death was more universally accessible, and culturally acceptable.

She's an adult, and whether you like it or not, she's flown the nest, and trying to hold her back is only going to cause harm. Let go.\n\nAlso:\n\n>All of her family is HERE, including me and her father and her brother, and her three living grandparents.\n\nIdk what her relationship is like with her grandparents, but  regardless, trying to weaponize them to gain control over someone is VERY emotionally manipulative. Speaking as someone who had their grandparents weaponized against them for almost a decade, it's just cruel. We aren't meant to put a pause on life for the sake of our parents or grandparents, especially at the expense of our happiness and safety.\n\nAnd on a final note:\n\n>I may not have been the best person to have custody of her as a child, but neither was her actively abusive father who stalked, abused, manipulated, and intimidated me the entire time I\u2019ve known him.\n\nDon't do this. Statements like these serve no one. \"I wasn't great but I could've been worse\" certainly isn't helping your case. It shifts any blame away from you by trivializing the impact you had on your children's lives, and paints you as THE victim, as opposed to a victim among several. I am sorry that your ex did all of that to you. No one should have to experience all of that, but remember that you weren't the only one impacted. Furthermore, I would posit that you aren't entirely innocent of abusive behavior. The family/grandparents bit alone is super manipulative, and your overall behavior to the very idea of your daughter moving away seems pretty possessive/controlling. People seem to think that \"soft abuse\" is more acceptable or tolerable that \"hard abuse\", but the reality is that, regardless of how subtle or well-intentioned you think your actions are, abuse is still abuse.

As you know first hand yourself, any partner can turn out to be abusive, whether you found them 5 feet away or 5000 miles away.\n\nWhat's more likely to happen though is that the relationship will be fine, and your daughter will start a new life.

You felt really angry at her for doing something that is pretty standard, ie taking the first steps into starting a new relationship.  I'm guessing you mainly felt hurt that she didn't share that with you.  Maybe now that you have completed rehab you were hoping to rebuild a better relationship with your daughter?  Maybe you thought your relationship was closer than it is and this has made you realise it isn't? Maybe you had hoped that your past hadn't affected your relationship as much as it has?  Maybe you had hoped that your daughter valued spending time with you more.\n\nYour daughter moving away isn't a slight against you.

At the age of 9 those issues become so severe that she can't live with her parents anymore. After 6 years of living (Where?) she goes back to her mother she has only seen briefly in those years and struggles and becomes withdrawn.  She was supposed to go to college and get a masters but her mental health collapsed to such a point she had to quit.  She still hasn't yet been able to go back.  She's suffered from depression for years and is struggling to cope but didn't feel like she could turn to her family for help.  She's gay in a red state.  **Her life isn't great right now**.

Here are some things to consider. At that age, we want to explore, have new experiences, find our home, meet new people. This is her chance to live. To thrive. Yes it's far, but your child doesn't need to live around family. I left home in my early 20s and lived 6 hours away for 10 years. I now live back in my home state to be close to my family.

But if your area has a lot of community members who are anti lgbtq+, the place she lives can feel scary, debilitating,  like she can't be herself. I have a siblings who left my home state for these reasons. We miss them, but they feel much freer to be themselves where they live. And safer. They were afraid of being murdered in my area because we do have a lot of angry, racist, anti lgbtq+ people here.\n\nYou need to accept that your daughter is an adult and instead of saying no, say, I'm worried about you, I care about you, I don't want you to go because I'll miss you so much,  so I hope you'll keep in touch with me.

I mean don't get me wrong, the older cynical part of me would share OP's concern.  I've been there where the daughter is, I have seen firsthand.  That's a long ways to go for a relationship, and you can think you know someone really well but then discover a completely different person when you move in.  You don't even have to live 1,000 miles apart to discover who your partner really is.  Just moving in together even if you both grew up in the same town your whole lives can reveal sides of them you never knew.\n\nSo I get the concern.  But, the daughter is an adult.  And the daughter needs to make her own decisions lol.  A parent has the hard job of letting go once their kid is old enough.  OP needs to do that.  Let her live and learn some shit.  And honestly, even if I share the cynicism of a youngster like that running off out of state to move in with a partner, and I'm fairly certain how an equation with those variables is likely to turn out...  We don't really know that shit.  I could be dead nuts wrong.  I don't think I am, but it'd still be very ignorant of me to say that I know a damn thing lol.\n\nNo, OP's daughter has every right, ever since she turned 18, to make her own life's decisions.  Hopefully it isn't a mistake.  But that's immaterial.  If it is, it is her mistake to make.  That's her right.  Nobody can tell her what to do.  If it's a mistake, then guess what?  She learns.

That anger stuck with me and I didn't feel like I had a safe place once my relationship went toxic and abusive... So I sank into it and took a long while to break free. Yes as an adult child, paying rent to parents isn't that unheard of, but that is something my mom could have waited to bring up whenever I did move back in instead of in anger while lashing out trying to hurt me cus she was hurt I was moving out.
