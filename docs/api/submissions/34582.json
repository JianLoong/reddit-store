It certainly sounds like it.", "NTA.\n\n>Around 5 mins before she's going I mention what my plans are when she goes out and she immediately says that she was going to ask me to walk her to the restaurant.\n\nThere was no good reason for her to wait until it was so late to bring this up. Was she expecting you to do the same again at the end of the evening?", "NTA. This is nonsense. She wants you to walk there, 35 minutes, and do what? Wait outside while she has a good time, or walk back, another 35 minutes? I would drive her, and offer to pick her up, and go to the movies while she was at the restaurant. It's a silly test of \"how much do you love her?\"... And the answer is, \"How much do you respect me, and my time?\"", "NTA.  It sounds like some kind of stupid test.  What was she planning to do when she left the restaurant?  Have you walk her home?", "NTA - to spring it on you just as you\u2019ve already told her you have your own plans is her poor planning if she was hoping you\u2019d walk with her. But why should you cancel your plans to just walk around endlessly while she goes out? If the safety is a concern then she can drive/take public transport.", "NTA If safety is a genuine concern she has plenty of options. If safety is not a genuine concern, she is trying to manipulate you.", "NTA did she also expect you to walk back to the restaurant when she was done?", "NTA - You already had plans and she had other options (to drive or get a ride?). \n\nI\u2019m guessing she\u2019s walking because sure doesn\u2019t want to drive home drunk? Is money tight? Can she afford a cab or ride share?", "Clearly you\u2019re the arsehole for not immediately recognising this as some kind of asinine boyfriend test. NTA", "You're NTA. She should have asked you sooner, for one thing. And practically speaking, what were her plans for you after the walk? Were you supposed to hang out with her friends? Leave, get home some way, then come back for her? Sit outside the restaurant and wait for her to be through,  then walk her home?", "She sounds exhausting.  Perhaps the best thing to do is let her walk alone and roll the dice if she gets there and back safely.  NTA, not even a little bit.", "NTA\n\nShe's probably trying to ruin your plans for the sake of it by guilt tripping you. Or she planned your evening too without even telling you and her plans for your evening is walking her there and then back. \n\nQuite frankly, she sounds very toxic and insufferable.", "She sounds delusional. Never in a million years. So it wouldn't be unsafe for you to walk back on your own!!", "NTA, not a relationship but I had friends like this, they made me feel responsible for walking them home even though they lived on the other side of town so like you it would be an hour+ round trip to go get back home. You are not responsible if she decides to walk instead of drive, could you not drive her?", "NTA. Sounds like a weird test. Were you supposed to pick her up too? Walk together to a restaurant when you both are expected at dinner", "This is an exact copy of something I read a few months ago", "This is a repost, I literally have no idea how people find and post the original but I know I have read this exact scenario before here.", "NTA - but are you sure this wasn't an opportunity to make the night a little more special and have a nice stroll out together?", "NTA if it actually conflicts with your plans you already advised her of, YTA if it doesn't. \n\nWalk the 35 then get a cab back to save time if you don't want to walk the 70 minutes. The walk there is a great way to spend some time together.", "Seems like you both need to communicate a bit more. \n\nShe told you what her plans were but you seemed surprised that she wanted you to walk her. \n\nDid you say what your plans were? Out of interest (and relevance), what were they? \n\nAs the other guy said, this is the chance for a nice leisurely stroll with your partner as opposed to the usual 'couch and phone' time. \n\nPersonally, I'd do the walk there then on the way back consider stopping off for either a take away meal or sit in somewhere for a quick pint etc. \n\nMissed chance from where I'm sitting.", "YTA.
