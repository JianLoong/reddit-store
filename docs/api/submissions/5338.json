If he had kids of his own from a previous relationship that were the same ages as yours I\u2019d cut him some slack. Despite you two living very different lives he still wants to get hitched after only two years?

If you\u2019re relationship is truly at the point where you\u2019re going to get married your relationship must have been through enough scenarios that you would be able to look back and say yes I noticed it or not.", "NTA. It's obviously none of your fianc\u00e9's business but I'd be concerned about his level of attention toward your son. He sounds creepy and this comes across like a \ud83d\udea9", "NTA. That\u2019s your child and your decision. Fianc\u00e9 is not his father. It\u2019s none of his business. Period.", "NTA! Why would your fianc\u00e9 want that for your son? That\u2019s just \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9. Let his controlling nature begin\u2026.. it also just sounds like your fianc\u00e9 wants a free laborer, your son.", "Nta, he needs to stay in his own lane.", "I can't believe nobody else has said ESH (except the kids). You aren't raising your kid. You aren't the asshole for not speaking to your SO but you are certainly the asshole for this situation existing in the first place. Of fucking course you shouldn't leave a 16-year-old alone, in an unfamiliar camper in an unfamiliar place for months at a time. You certainly shouldn't make your 21-year-old daughter pick up the slack. I'm sure you are saying in your head \"I'm not making my daughter do this\" but you are, because your daughter has the empathy to realize that its the best of some terrible options.", "NTA, don't budge at all, your fiance needs to mind his own business. Your fiance is showing his true colors, trust this and reflect if you want to be with him.", "Need more information, Since your 2 year relationship with your fianc\u00e9,has he been involved in your children\u2019s life? Does he help financially with the kids, what\u2019s the relationship like between the two? People here are quick to say something  along the lines of \u201coh he not the bio dad so he shouldn\u2019t have a say\u201d. Maybe they have been building a bond and your fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t ready to give that up maybe he feels like he been trying to be a step parent to your children. Maybe he feels like he not an equal in the relationship so he just wanted to be asked. Long story short is IF he is trying to step up and be a good step parent that\u2019s pretty hard as is. I\u2019d imagine it be even harder with your son out the house.", "It does. What really comes across as suspect is that he wants the kid to be isolated own trailer. I'm admittedly a pessimist, but this sounds like what leads to and episode of Dateline. I hope OP has talked to her son and made sure he's felt no discomfort from fianc\u00e9", "None of this matters. The son is 16 so 2 years ago he was 14. The fianc\u00e9 is not the sons father figure in any way shape or form had he doesn\u2019t get a vote.", "You aren't sure, so are you curious and getting to the bottom of this?", "Oof.  He is playing out his childhood issues on you and your nearly grown kids.  \n\nIf he wants a child of his own, he should be in a relationship with someone who wants the same thing.", "\u201cThe fianc\u00e9 is not the sons father figure in anyway shape or form\u201d Where does OP state that?", "I am not saying there's anything nefarious, but I would expect you as a mother to be more curious about why the deal not being honoured upsets your fiance to this extent. Not being \"bothered\" by the deal goes for a toss if your fiance reacts in this manner."]}
