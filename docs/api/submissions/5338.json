If he had kids of his own from a previous relationship that were the same ages as yours I\u2019d cut him some slack. Despite you two living very different lives he still wants to get hitched after only two years?

With that being said why wouldn\u2019t you want your SO to step up and fill in the role and be that male figure for your kids. again IF he is trying to step up into that role why would you down play it or belittle and or have a mind set of \u201coh they\u2019re not your kids\u201d. Also looking at OPs and her SO age it would be hard for her to give him a child at her age without having complications, maybe he sees OP son as his chance to be a dad.
