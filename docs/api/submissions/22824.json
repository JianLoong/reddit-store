He has no right to impose his religious beliefs on you or expect you to follow them.", "NTA, it seems your mother has sacrificed your well being for her comfort and money.

Also, you're only 16, so one screaming session at your mom isn't going to hurt (I've seen teens do way worse!). Of course, you aren't supposed to scream at your mom, but I can imagine it's pent up rage from those past 4 years of having to deal with your father. I would apologize for screaming at your mom, but she also needs to realize that the way your dad is behaving is not OK and in my personal opinion needs to at least be discussed.   \n\n\nI also have no clue if you are christian or muslim, but if you aren't either then he has no reason to dictate your beliefs. I really hope you can find a new Stray Kids poster soon and resolve this, your dad is abusive.", "NTA.

You need to communicate especially since it happened when she wasn't here. \nYour step dad is an AH too.Plenty of Muslims listen to music, watch Anime, etc. Your SD will be shocked to know that Muslims participate and in Kpop competitions(and won) in Korea.
