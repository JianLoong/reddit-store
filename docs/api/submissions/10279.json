Don't most people do a checklist before they leave home. The passport would be up there with \"ticket\" for me. Passport, ticket, wallet, bag. Ok good to go.", "NTA.

Hope you had a good time.", "NTA- your friend\u2019s expectations do not align with being a true friend.", "Definitely NTA. You had everything you needed to go, so why let your friend\u2019s mistake ruin the trip for you? Your friend is pissed and instead of pissed at herself, she\u2019s decided to lash out. She needs to grow up and take personal responsibility", "NTA.

No doubt you\u2019re annoyed with her because she screwed up the travel plans. You were meant to travel together.

It really sucks that she made a mistake she has to pay for, but I\u2019m guessing you would be out a substantial amount of money if you went with her too. When I\u2019m traveling, the one thing I\u2019m making sure I walk out the door with is my ID/passport. \n\nI think she is misplacing her frustration and a her on you so she doesn\u2019t have to take full accountability for her own lack of planning.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nShe didn't catch a later flight or what happened?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou did nothing wrong. SHE was irresponsible and paid the price. NO NEED for you to vaste a vacation, too.", "NTA. It would have been worse for you, and really no better for your friend, if you also didn't go.\n\nFriend can work out how to travel, maybe catch a later flight, but you just 'being there' isn't going to help. Emotional support is important for the loss of a loved one, etc....just forgetting a passport is one of those things to be handled by that person.\n\nDumb mistakes happen, and you can say you're sorry she didn't make it. It would be NAH if friend wasn't pissed and being pissy about it.\n\nEnjoy New York!", "NTA. \n\nAsk her if she would have reimbursed all the money you would have lost, because ultimately you weren't the one that caused the missed flight. \nHad you gone with her you would have lost flight and hotel money, she would be responsible for that and you thought she would rather not owe you all the money.", "NTA... If she was not willing to buy you a new ticket, she should not demand from you to lose your hard earned $$$...\n\nAlso find more responsible and less entitled friends...", "You\u2019re not her mother. You\u2019re an adult and she should have been better prepared. Her lack of responsibility doesn\u2019t become your problem.", "NTA", "NTA she could\u2019ve caught a later flight if she wanted. Why on earth should you loose hundreds of dollars because she made an avoidable mistake? Who doesn\u2019t make sure they have their ID and tickets before going to the airport?", "NTA. What else were you supposed to do?", "LOL. that's not your problem. SHE forgot her passport, you didn't. its so easy for people to say, \"i wouldn't do that if it were me.\" she's trying to justify it but she can't. she needs to be more responsible. NTA", "Why did she think that just because of her failure to plan you should also miss the trip? NTA.", "NTA I was faced with this choice once and logistically, it makes a lot more sense to get on the plane and catch up with her later than to try to find two sets of new tickets/travel methods on the day of travel.", "NTA... it's not logical to pay for a second missed flight. You can go ahead of her and get things organized", "\u201cMisery loves company.\u201d NTA", "NTA. I would have let them know that I would get on the plane without them before they left to go get their passport. If she missed the flight that\u2019s on her.", "NTA. Why would it be better to negotiate and pay for TWO missed flights instead of ONE?", "Info; was she planning on reimbursing you for flight and hotel because she wanted you not to go because of her error? \n\nIf, as I strongly suspect, she was not - NTA.

NTA.", "NTA- Your friend needs to learn how to adult.", "NTA\nYour friend isn't much of a friend of she's the one who screwed up but gets mad at you for continuing on with a trip you already paid for. A real friend wouldn't want you to miss out because they couldn't get their ish together.", "Why can\u2019t she just join you? She is the one who forgot. NTA.", " NTA you don\u2019t have to give up your vacation and lose your money because she fucked up.", "NTA my friend and I booked an international flight and I had the luck of being selected for a random security screening. It took a long time. Even though my friend and I were extra early for the flight, it was getting down to the wire. She texted me if she should stay with me. I said of course not because why should we both be inconvenienced and I wished her a safe flight. \n\nI don\u2019t get adults who throw tantrums because they don\u2019t want to do things in their own. Not your job to hold her hand.", "NTA - your friend's expectations put her in the AH category though....", "Yep. Like, how do you not triple check you have the three things you absolutely have to have while traveling internationally? Phone, wallet, and passport. Everything else can be replaced, but you need those three.", "Passport beats ticket. I can't even remember the last time I needed a ticket to fly. I  mean technically nowadays, you could fly with just your passport and phone.", "its literally the first thing we pack! can't leave home without it.", "i've forgotten my passport only once, and the stress nearly had me in a breakdown.
