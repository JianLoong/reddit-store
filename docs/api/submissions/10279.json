It really sucks that she made a mistake she has to pay for, but I\u2019m guessing you would be out a substantial amount of money if you went with her too. When I\u2019m traveling, the one thing I\u2019m making sure I walk out the door with is my ID/passport. \n\nI think she is misplacing her frustration and a her on you so she doesn\u2019t have to take full accountability for her own lack of planning.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nShe didn't catch a later flight or what happened?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou did nothing wrong.

It would have been worse for you, and really no better for your friend, if you also didn't go.\n\nFriend can work out how to travel, maybe catch a later flight, but you just 'being there' isn't going to help. Emotional support is important for the loss of a loved one, etc....just forgetting a passport is one of those things to be handled by that person.\n\nDumb mistakes happen, and you can say you're sorry she didn't make it. It would be NAH if friend wasn't pissed and being pissy about it.\n\nEnjoy New York!", "NTA. \n\nAsk her if she would have reimbursed all the money you would have lost, because ultimately you weren't the one that caused the missed flight. \nHad you gone with her you would have lost flight and hotel money, she would be responsible for that and you thought she would rather not owe you all the money.", "NTA... If she was not willing to buy you a new ticket, she should not demand from you to lose your hard earned $$$...\n\nAlso find more responsible and less entitled friends...", "You\u2019re not her mother.

Why on earth should you loose hundreds of dollars because she made an avoidable mistake? Who doesn\u2019t make sure they have their ID and tickets before going to the airport?", "NTA. What else were you supposed to do?", "LOL. that's not your problem. SHE forgot her passport, you didn't. its so easy for people to say, \"i wouldn't do that if it were me.\" she's trying to justify it but she can't. she needs to be more responsible. NTA", "Why did she think that just because of her failure to plan you should also miss the trip? NTA.", "NTA I was faced with this choice once and logistically, it makes a lot more sense to get on the plane and catch up with her later than to try to find two sets of new tickets/travel methods on the day of travel.", "NTA... it's not logical to pay for a second missed flight. You can go ahead of her and get things organized", "\u201cMisery loves company.\u201d NTA", "NTA. I would have let them know that I would get on the plane without them before they left to go get their passport. If she missed the flight that\u2019s on her.", "NTA. Why would it be better to negotiate and pay for TWO missed flights instead of ONE?", "Info; was she planning on reimbursing you for flight and hotel because she wanted you not to go because of her error? \n\nIf, as I strongly suspect, she was not - NTA.

NTA.", "NTA- Your friend needs to learn how to adult.", "NTA\nYour friend isn't much of a friend of she's the one who screwed up but gets mad at you for continuing on with a trip you already paid for.

It took a long time. Even though my friend and I were extra early for the flight, it was getting down to the wire. She texted me if she should stay with me. I said of course not because why should we both be inconvenienced and I wished her a safe flight. \n\nI don\u2019t get adults who throw tantrums because they don\u2019t want to do things in their own. Not your job to hold her hand.", "NTA - your friend's expectations put her in the AH category though....", "Yep. Like, how do you not triple check you have the three things you absolutely have to have while traveling internationally? Phone, wallet, and passport.

I  mean technically nowadays, you could fly with just your passport and phone.", "its literally the first thing we pack! can't leave home without it.", "i've forgotten my passport only once, and the stress nearly had me in a breakdown.

Passports aren't needed for state to state travel only driver license or id", "NTA!!!", "NTA. Flights are expensive (and typically not refundable). Hotels can release your booking if you don't pitch up on the opening night. There's no need to double your financial pain by both of you missing the flight.", "NTA. She got all the way to the airport before she noticed she didn't have her passport? That's definitely not on you and there is no reason you should have missed your trip because she was irresponsible.", "NTA. I literally have ADHD, which makes me INCREDIBLY prone to forgetting shit, and even I cannot imagine being stupid/irresponsible enough to leave my passport at home.  It would literally be the first thing I'd put in my carry-on, in an easily accessible outer compartment,  to avoid this exact scenario.", "NTA. Though you and your friend were traveling together, you were not joined at the hip. SHE was unprepared for the flight, not you. However much you may empathize with her situation, you do not have to share it.  If you'd not arrived at the hotel, you may have lost the booking. Your friend could have gotten a later flight.", "NTA maybe next time she\u2019ll remember her passport. Was she going to reimburse you for all the money you spent for a trip she was trying to ruin? I\u2019m sure was not going to.", "Forgetting her passport & expecting you to miss part of your vacay/hotel was a dick move. NTA.", "Nope, NTA. I remember seeing a tweet a while back about how pissed off some girl was that her friend had forgotten her passport so as a result both of them had missed their holiday and *all* of the comments were saying she should've just gone without her. You shouldn't miss out just because she messed up.", "NTA Not your responsibility.", "Reminds me of a joke I read a long time ago and before smart phones:  \n\nAs the husband stood in the airport line, he looked over his wife\u2019s large assortment of bags and luggage and sadly remarked \u201cI wish I had brought the piano with us.\u201d\n\nHis wife said, \u201cjust because I brought a lot of clothes doesn\u2019t mean you need to be sarcastic!\u201c\n\nThe husband said, \u201cI\u2019m not being sarcastic. I left the tickets on the piano.\u201d", "Ask her if she would be willing to cover the cost of your flight change for her mistake? If it\u2019s a no then she can shove it. She fucked up, she has to deal with the consequences. Simples.", "NTA\nShe made a mistake and wanted you to share in her mistake. It's pretty messed up of her to want you to miss out on your trip because she screwed up. I don't know if that's her usual behaviour but if it is... doesn't sound like a very good friend.", "NTA. Her lack of preparation isn't your emergency", "NTA. Make sure to note to her that you didn\u2019t realize that\u2019s how she views travel together and you\u2019re sad you won\u2019t be traveling with her again. Nobody wants to travel with a child on tow unless they have to. It\u2019s hard enough taking care of yourself.", "NTA \n\nHer unpreparedness does not equal an emergency on your part.", "NTA. I am paranoid and I check for my passport multiple times before either leave my house. Last time once I'm in the car. That's a big thing to forget and no you shouldn't suffer and lose out on your money because she f*cked up.", "NTA. You paid good money for the trip!

It wasn't like she had a medical emergency or something. A good friend would have told you to go ahead, and apologized to *you* for worrying and inconveniencing you.\n\nForgetting her passport is pretty irresponsible. I mean, you can forget your underwear, but don't forget your passport!!", "Not your problem.", "NTA. Your friend is an adult and knew what was needed to for the trip. It\u2019s her own fault she forgot.", "NTA. She should be the one saying \"Go yourself so at least the money is not wasted\".

NTA", "Yes, the long weekend implies Presidents Day, unless there's other random holidays in February internationally, but arguably I don't think someone would fly from Europe for a long weekend only, so I'm assuming they're both Americans, so if the friend had a driver's license, that's all they needed to fly, no passport necessary, for domestic travel.", "L take. please grow as a person", "Why?", "Hello OPs \"friend\"", "I'm on vacation right now.

Everything else can be bought/replaced/sorted.", "\u2026 and then you turn up at the airport without your ticket.\n\nLuckily it had been booked online and there was an Internet cafe with a printer, but that was a pretty scary time. \n\nEver since, I\u2019ve printed two copies: one to go with the passport that gets checked once, one for keeping in my pocket and checking and double-checking and checking again.", "And then multiple times standing in line, and about 5 more times after the line to make sure I didn't leave it at the security checkpoint... And then periodically throughout the trip. Repeat for coming home \ud83d\ude05", "I was thinking the same thing, but I think OP might be from Canada. It's also a long weekend provincial holiday on Monday for most Canadian provinces.", "NTA. The dick move is your friend forgetting the passport.", "Luckily with smartphones there isn't really a need to print the ticket anymore", "I lost my phone in Mexico few months ago right before my flight and they printed my online ticket without issue by just checking my passport with their data \ud83d\udc4c so I would definitely say that passport and Covid vax papers are the most important things now when you travel.
