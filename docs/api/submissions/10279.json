Don't most people do a checklist before they leave home. The passport would be up there with \"ticket\" for me. Passport, ticket, wallet, bag. Ok good to go.", "NTA. Your friend is an adult and responsible for packing all the items necessary for a successful trip. This is a strong instance of not my monkey not my circus not my problem.", "NTA. The dick move is your friend forgetting the passport. Very selfish of them to say you should have had your trip ruined because of them. Hope you had a good time.", "NTA- your friend\u2019s expectations do not align with being a true friend.", "Definitely NTA. You had everything you needed to go, so why let your friend\u2019s mistake ruin the trip for you? Your friend is pissed and instead of pissed at herself, she\u2019s decided to lash out. She needs to grow up and take personal responsibility", "NTA. Why should you both lose out because she messed up. \n\nGo enjoy New York, I wish I was there", "NTA she put herself into the situation to miss her flight.

She needs to look at herself, not you.", "NTA. You came prepared, and she didn\u2019t. Bet you she won\u2019t leave her passport next time.

Sorry not sorry.", "NTA She should\u2019ve made a list and double checked before arriving", "Understandably your friend is disappointed & she\u2019s is taking that out on you. No doubt you\u2019re annoyed with her because she screwed up the travel plans. You were meant to travel together. You did the right thing, certainly wasn\u2019t your fault but it still sucks for both of you. Sometimes even the best planned trips go sideways. \n\nHopefully, you still have a fun trip!\n\nNAH", "INFO:  Do you 2 not have phones and couldn't keep in touch while she went to get her passport?

It really sucks that she made a mistake she has to pay for, but I\u2019m guessing you would be out a substantial amount of money if you went with her too. When I\u2019m traveling, the one thing I\u2019m making sure I walk out the door with is my ID/passport. \n\nI think she is misplacing her frustration and a her on you so she doesn\u2019t have to take full accountability for her own lack of planning.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nShe didn't catch a later flight or what happened?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou did nothing wrong.

It would have been worse for you, and really no better for your friend, if you also didn't go.\n\nFriend can work out how to travel, maybe catch a later flight, but you just 'being there' isn't going to help. Emotional support is important for the loss of a loved one, etc....just forgetting a passport is one of those things to be handled by that person.\n\nDumb mistakes happen, and you can say you're sorry she didn't make it. It would be NAH if friend wasn't pissed and being pissy about it.\n\nEnjoy New York!", "NTA. \n\nAsk her if she would have reimbursed all the money you would have lost, because ultimately you weren't the one that caused the missed flight. \nHad you gone with her you would have lost flight and hotel money, she would be responsible for that and you thought she would rather not owe you all the money."]}
