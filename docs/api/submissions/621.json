It didn't take much to drop you, so either you weren't that important to him, or he's just that bad at dealing with the consequences of his actions. And honestly I think it could fall either way. \n\nI'm sorry that such a rare and expensive game had to be the price for you to find this out about him, though. **NTA.**", "NTA.

He\u2019s definitely not the person you thought he was. He never told you that he broke the game or if this even the truth.

Cos you got DARVO'd.\n\nTLDR: stands for deny, attack, reverse victim and offender. He broke (or more likely stole) your property. You are upset. He turns it around on its head and acts like YOU wronged HIM and bent over backwards to come up with a rationalization. \n\nOnce you're aware of this insidious abuse tactic you will see it everywhere in situations where you deal with entitled people. Cut out people in your life who DARVO rather than have honest, reasonable conversations with you.
