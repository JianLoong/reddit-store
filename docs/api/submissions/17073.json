The wedding is in a few weeks time and we have been together for 10 years.\n\nI come from a large family and have an older sister Kate, who went pescatarian just before I met Julie. Her 2 kids and husband are also following the same diet.\n\nNow Julie is very allergic to any type of fish or seafood, to the point if I eat something with fish sauce and kiss her on a cheek, she will likely end up in a hospital in a critical condition. We found this out the hard way. So for our wedding we only offered 2 meal options: meat (no fish/seafood) or vegeterian with accomodation to allergies. Kate's kids were allowed to bring fish sandwiches as long as they eat them not in a close proximity to Julie and only because of the pressure from my family.\n\nVery recently Julie and me found out we are expecting our first child together. At the time of the wedding she will be 12 weeks pregnant and Julie wants to announce her pregnancy on our wedding day. She is not comfortable announcing it sooner due to personal and some work related issues it can cause.\n\nDue to this I had to give my sister a call yesterday and tell her that the plans have changed and her kids (11 and 9) were no longer allowed to bring any seafood or any dishes containing fish and would have to suck it up with vegetarian/meat option or bring something else that won't trigger Julie's allergy. I haven't told Kate about Julie's pregnancy as she can't keep a secret at all. \n\nKate is not happy and have called me an asshole and that \"they are just kids and they don't like veggies\". I have told her that it is not my problem since pescatarian doesn't mean eating only fish, but other vegetarian friendly foods too, but Kate is not having it.

For goodness sake, if they are pescetarians, it is not religion, it is not an allergy,\nAnyone, even carnivores can eat vegetarian.... that includes eggs and dairy btw. That is plenty for them to not go hungry. If they are that picky, that's their own problem. Let them starve, maybe that's what those entitled people need.\nthey cannot demand others to accommodate to their  whim.

It\u2019s your wedding so you already get to dictate the menu and on top of that there are serious heath issues to consider here. \n\nI\u2019m hoping after the wedding when Kate knows about the pregnancy she will understand why you changed the rule and all this can blow over for the day. Hope you two have a happy marriage!", "NTA, though without being able to tell Kate why I can see her not being happy with the change of plan. That said, risking both mother and child for a dietary whim of some family members is a no go. Besides it's your wedding, you get to set the menu. Furthermore it is your and your fiance's baby and you get to choose when and how to announce it. \n\nCould you hint to Kate that there is a VERY good reason for this change that will be explained later?", "NTA\n\n. . . though frankly, I'm tempted to call it E-S-H just because the whole pregnancy thing seems both irrelevant and illogical. You haven't provided any explanation as to how pregnancy would somehow make what you claim was already a life-threatening allergy even worse? And for the life of me I can't understand why you would have risked your fianc\u00e9's health and safety in the first place, even if she wasn't pregnant? None of the way you've explained the change in plans makes any sense at all, and it's very tempting to call you an AH for allowing them to have fish sandwiches in the first place when there was no good reason for it . . . and clearly there's no good reason for it.\n\nAnd hence the crux of why you are NTA: if those children are pescatarians, it doesn't mean that they primarily eat fish. It means that they are primarily vegetarians, who will also eat fish (and possibly seafood).  Your sister's argument that they \"don't like veggies\" is incredibly weird, and while not completely outside the realm of possibility, because they ARE kids . . . clearly this is an issue she has already figured out, if they're eating a pescatarian diet full-time. And guaranteed, they aren't eating fish sandwiches for breakfast, lunch, and dinner; so there is obviously some non-fish alternative that she could have suggested (pasta, perhaps?) that wouldn't have been potentially deathly to your bride. \n\nThe whole pregnancy thing, though, seems like a weird red herring (no pun intended). And you're a bit of an AH for even agreeing to let them have something the bride was deathly allergic to in the first place.", "Esh she\u2019s is horribly allergic it\u2019s her wedding as well with or without the pregnancy she shouldn\u2019t have to worry whose around her that being said you shouldn\u2019t of agreed in the first place and of you said to your sister how you wrote you were unnecessarily rude and your family shouldn\u2019t have be pressuring to allow this", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
