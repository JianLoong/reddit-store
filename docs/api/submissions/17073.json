The wedding is in a few weeks time and we have been together for 10 years.\n\nI come from a large family and have an older sister Kate, who went pescatarian just before I met Julie. Her 2 kids and husband are also following the same diet.\n\nNow Julie is very allergic to any type of fish or seafood, to the point if I eat something with fish sauce and kiss her on a cheek, she will likely end up in a hospital in a critical condition. We found this out the hard way. So for our wedding we only offered 2 meal options: meat (no fish/seafood) or vegeterian with accomodation to allergies. Kate's kids were allowed to bring fish sandwiches as long as they eat them not in a close proximity to Julie and only because of the pressure from my family.\n\nVery recently Julie and me found out we are expecting our first child together. At the time of the wedding she will be 12 weeks pregnant and Julie wants to announce her pregnancy on our wedding day. She is not comfortable announcing it sooner due to personal and some work related issues it can cause.\n\nDue to this I had to give my sister a call yesterday and tell her that the plans have changed and her kids (11 and 9) were no longer allowed to bring any seafood or any dishes containing fish and would have to suck it up with vegetarian/meat option or bring something else that won't trigger Julie's allergy. I haven't told Kate about Julie's pregnancy as she can't keep a secret at all. \n\nKate is not happy and have called me an asshole and that \"they are just kids and they don't like veggies\". I have told her that it is not my problem since pescatarian doesn't mean eating only fish, but other vegetarian friendly foods too, but Kate is not having it.

For goodness sake, if they are pescetarians, it is not religion, it is not an allergy,\nAnyone, even carnivores can eat vegetarian.... that includes eggs and dairy btw. That is plenty for them to not go hungry. If they are that picky, that's their own problem. Let them starve, maybe that's what those entitled people need.\nthey cannot demand others to accommodate to their  whim.

It\u2019s your wedding so you already get to dictate the menu and on top of that there are serious heath issues to consider here. \n\nI\u2019m hoping after the wedding when Kate knows about the pregnancy she will understand why you changed the rule and all this can blow over for the day. Hope you two have a happy marriage!", "NTA, though without being able to tell Kate why I can see her not being happy with the change of plan. That said, risking both mother and child for a dietary whim of some family members is a no go. Besides it's your wedding, you get to set the menu. Furthermore it is your and your fiance's baby and you get to choose when and how to announce it. \n\nCould you hint to Kate that there is a VERY good reason for this change that will be explained later?", "NTA\n\n. . . though frankly, I'm tempted to call it E-S-H just because the whole pregnancy thing seems both irrelevant and illogical. You haven't provided any explanation as to how pregnancy would somehow make what you claim was already a life-threatening allergy even worse? And for the life of me I can't understand why you would have risked your fianc\u00e9's health and safety in the first place, even if she wasn't pregnant? None of the way you've explained the change in plans makes any sense at all, and it's very tempting to call you an AH for allowing them to have fish sandwiches in the first place when there was no good reason for it . . . and clearly there's no good reason for it.\n\nAnd hence the crux of why you are NTA: if those children are pescatarians, it doesn't mean that they primarily eat fish. It means that they are primarily vegetarians, who will also eat fish (and possibly seafood).  Your sister's argument that they \"don't like veggies\" is incredibly weird, and while not completely outside the realm of possibility, because they ARE kids . . . clearly this is an issue she has already figured out, if they're eating a pescatarian diet full-time. And guaranteed, they aren't eating fish sandwiches for breakfast, lunch, and dinner; so there is obviously some non-fish alternative that she could have suggested (pasta, perhaps?) that wouldn't have been potentially deathly to your bride. \n\nThe whole pregnancy thing, though, seems like a weird red herring (no pun intended). And you're a bit of an AH for even agreeing to let them have something the bride was deathly allergic to in the first place.", "Esh she\u2019s is horribly allergic it\u2019s her wedding as well with or without the pregnancy she shouldn\u2019t have to worry whose around her that being said you shouldn\u2019t of agreed in the first place and of you said to your sister how you wrote you were unnecessarily rude and your family shouldn\u2019t have be pressuring to allow this", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm not saying parents should force them to eat anything nor starving them, I am however saying that they should take the battle/confrontation/conversation it with the children. There's also a big difference between not liking certain specific foods, and then only eating a very specific thing (in this case fish). Iirc it takes around 6 \"tries\" before a child begins to like a new food. I think it's an important part of raising a child, to actually take the small battles and not just give up on your child, which in this case is continuously getting the child to try new foods, so they don't end up having problems with having a balanced and nutritious diet.\n\nMany kids primarily wants sugary foods, or food that is generally not very good for them. Are you saying that any attempt to raise a child with a balanced and healthy diet, is giving them either an eating disorder or making them rigid about food?\n\nI'm curious, how would you handle a child who only wants to eat fish sticks for example? Just feed them fish sticks for every meal?", "You owe kitty some fish now.", "Even though it's almost 11 pm now I want some mozzarella sticks that I have in the freezer.", "This a thousand times!", "Should she not have a plan like that in place anyways, wedding or not? Unless she never leaves the house she will always potentially cross paths with someone who maybe ate fish right before and then touched something that she touched; even without having any idea about allergies. I can\u2019t imagine in practice how someone avoids that completely.", "Yeah, sparkle doom is not saying there aren\u2019t plenty of ways to get the required nutrients as a vegetarian. Just that this woman is not a vegetarian, she\u2019s a meat eater. If you\u2019re already a meat eater, it\u2019s easier to just keep eating your normal diet, than to change to an entirely different way of eating and make sure you\u2019re doing it in such a way to be healthy.   \n\n\nIf she wanted to be a vegetarian anyway, then fine. But it doesn\u2019t make sense specifically to change your whole diet during pregnancy if it\u2019s not necessary and you\u2019ll be trying to learn a new way of eating while making sure you don\u2019t miss any nutrients during pregnancy.   \n\n\nIt\u2019s like exercising. There are people who run marathons prepregnancy and continue during. But we don\u2019t recommend people who\u2019ve been sedentary taking up marathons once they\u2019re pregnant.", "I had fish sandwiches for my first year at school until I gave up and made my own lunches. It was not pleasant.", "Yes! Absolutely! The plan might be different with a baby in the mix though. So definitely have a convo with the OB/GYN \ud83d\ude42", "Definitely, but that may change with pregnancy or OP might not be up to date - and with an allergy this severe, I'd consider informing several people what to do in case of emergency and where an epi pen is. \n\nIf in doubt, use an epi pen (if it can be found), call 911 and monitor breathing/do chest compressions if necessary. It's recommended to do rescue breaths for pregnant women and children, hands-only CPR for anyone else (if you're not a trained professional, at least) - unlikely to make much of a difference during anaphylaxis bc of closed airways, but can help if the person doesn't resume breathing afterwards. Hopefully that knowledge won't be necessary, but it's good to know in case it is.", "They're peskytarians", "Exactly. And kids are terrible bullies to anyone who doesn\u2019t things that are considered weird. Smelling like fish daily would be weird for lots of kids", "Shut up. I'm asking how long the random redditor knows the lady she says \"seems like something she'd do\"."]}
