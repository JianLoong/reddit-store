The wedding is in a few weeks time and we have been together for 10 years.\n\nI come from a large family and have an older sister Kate, who went pescatarian just before I met Julie. Her 2 kids and husband are also following the same diet.\n\nNow Julie is very allergic to any type of fish or seafood, to the point if I eat something with fish sauce and kiss her on a cheek, she will likely end up in a hospital in a critical condition. We found this out the hard way. So for our wedding we only offered 2 meal options: meat (no fish/seafood) or vegeterian with accomodation to allergies. Kate's kids were allowed to bring fish sandwiches as long as they eat them not in a close proximity to Julie and only because of the pressure from my family.\n\nVery recently Julie and me found out we are expecting our first child together. At the time of the wedding she will be 12 weeks pregnant and Julie wants to announce her pregnancy on our wedding day. She is not comfortable announcing it sooner due to personal and some work related issues it can cause.\n\nDue to this I had to give my sister a call yesterday and tell her that the plans have changed and her kids (11 and 9) were no longer allowed to bring any seafood or any dishes containing fish and would have to suck it up with vegetarian/meat option or bring something else that won't trigger Julie's allergy. I haven't told Kate about Julie's pregnancy as she can't keep a secret at all. \n\nKate is not happy and have called me an asshole and that \"they are just kids and they don't like veggies\". I have told her that it is not my problem since pescatarian doesn't mean eating only fish, but other vegetarian friendly foods too, but Kate is not having it.

There\u2019s also non vegetable foods that are also (gasp) not fish or meat.", "NTA.

Instead of fish sandwiches, they could have cheese, jam, egg...", "NTA - though you should never have agreed to the fish sandwiches in the first place. Your bride is highly allergic.", "NTA. It's literally a medical concern, and honestly, if kids don't like eating veggies, it's the parents problem, not yours. You provided them with a viable food option.", "NTA- if Julie is allergic then this should have been what was happening from the beginning.  You are giving them a veggie choice, so they either eat it or not.  And wow if they aren't eating veggies, they should be making sure the kids are on a balanced diet, these arent toddlers!", "NTA. It's your event, you decide the food. They can go a few hours without that specific food. It is better to keep your future wife and child as safe as possible.", "NTA - It's your/her wedding, Kate can stop off at McDicks and grab a filthy fish fillet if they're that hard up for fish. \n\nRealistically though, Kate is a *massive asshole* for knowing your wife is deathly allergic, and still insisting on bringing fish to your/her wedding. Especially kids, who aren't exactly the smartest and cleanest of people.", "NTA, with or without the pregnancy you shouldn\u2019t be bullied into accepting such bizarre requests with awful excuses such as \u201cthey are kids they don\u2019t like vegetables\u201d.

You\u2019re not eating solely fish with that diet. You do not give in because this is detrimental to your fianc\u00e9\u2019s and child\u2019s health. This is a safety concern.", "NTA.\n\nIt sucks that plans had to change. But when allergies are in play, it's simply too dangerous.", "NTA.

You don't know who had fish for breakfast or lunch before arriving at the wedding, or the thoroughness of their personal hygiene. \n\nTake whatever precautions she needs as far as limiting kissing, washing hands, whatever.\n\nI'd make the pregnancy announcement as early as possible at the wedding and include a reminder about the allergy.\n\nYou've made your request of Kate, and nothing is going to change by reiterating the request. She'll make her own decision.\n\n(And the wedding is just the tip of the iceberg for this conflict, you've got a lifetime of holidays and family events where this will be on repeat.)\n\nFor now, you've got enough on your plate with your fianc\u00e9, pregnancy and wedding. \n\nCongratulations!", "NTA.   Accommodating someone's dietary needs at your wedding is pretty much a given--so offer vegetarian??    Allergies are serious shit.

And guests are not supposed to dictate what their hosts serve.", "Kate can take her kids to a drive thru before, during, or after the reception. To demand to eat something that the bride is allergic to - *at* the reception - is insane. Tell her the decision is final and if she tries to bring an allergen to the wedding she will not be allowed in until it's disposed of or eaten outside. NTA holy hell", "NTA - how else can you say \"I don't want my wife and un-born child to die on our wedding day\".  My flabber is gasted that your sister thinks her kids eating habits (which she is responsible for) are more important than living.  Congrats on both the wedding and pregnancy, OP and best of luck!!!", "NTA going one meal without meat or fish isn't asking too much", "INFO\n\nWhy is this an issue? I don't know anyone pescatarian who eats seafood at ever meal, or even every fancy dinner. And I and multiple family members were pescatarian for over a decade.\n\nIs the vegetarian option a bit crap?", "CONGRATS ON YOUR BABY NEWS!!!!!\n\nAlso, NTA. Obviously.", "NTA,  AH for allowing it at the first place. It should never even be a point of discussion. Your fiance is allergic to something and it is her wedding day! FGS that is enough. What if they eat something and then give her a hug after ceremony and she has a reaction?! It is her wedding, any risk should be avoided.\nWe are talking about food. For goodness sake, if they are pescetarians, it is not religion, it is not an allergy,\nAnyone, even carnivores can eat vegetarian.... that includes eggs and dairy btw. That is plenty for them to not go hungry. If they are that picky, that's their own problem. Let them starve, maybe that's what those entitled people need.\nthey cannot demand others to accommodate to their  whim. I would even go as far as uninviting them if they cannot respect that someone has a life threatening allergy.", "cant they have some vegan burguers or plant based options that mimic meat/fish?\n\nNTA (the option should be provided by your sister, anyway)", "Rough NAH\n\nI think Kate was wrong to call you an asshole but she did so not having all the details of the situation so it is possible she felt a little targeted and defensive. It doesn\u2019t seem she has done anymore than that so don\u2019t want to fault her too much. \n\nYou and Julie are obviously not assholes here. It\u2019s your wedding so you already get to dictate the menu and on top of that there are serious heath issues to consider here. \n\nI\u2019m hoping after the wedding when Kate knows about the pregnancy she will understand why you changed the rule and all this can blow over for the day. Hope you two have a happy marriage!", "NTA, though without being able to tell Kate why I can see her not being happy with the change of plan. That said, risking both mother and child for a dietary whim of some family members is a no go. Besides it's your wedding, you get to set the menu. Furthermore it is your and your fiance's baby and you get to choose when and how to announce it. \n\nCould you hint to Kate that there is a VERY good reason for this change that will be explained later?", "NTA\n\n. . . though frankly, I'm tempted to call it E-S-H just because the whole pregnancy thing seems both irrelevant and illogical. You haven't provided any explanation as to how pregnancy would somehow make what you claim was already a life-threatening allergy even worse? And for the life of me I can't understand why you would have risked your fianc\u00e9's health and safety in the first place, even if she wasn't pregnant? None of the way you've explained the change in plans makes any sense at all, and it's very tempting to call you an AH for allowing them to have fish sandwiches in the first place when there was no good reason for it . . . and clearly there's no good reason for it.\n\nAnd hence the crux of why you are NTA: if those children are pescatarians, it doesn't mean that they primarily eat fish. It means that they are primarily vegetarians, who will also eat fish (and possibly seafood).  Your sister's argument that they \"don't like veggies\" is incredibly weird, and while not completely outside the realm of possibility, because they ARE kids . . . clearly this is an issue she has already figured out, if they're eating a pescatarian diet full-time. And guaranteed, they aren't eating fish sandwiches for breakfast, lunch, and dinner; so there is obviously some non-fish alternative that she could have suggested (pasta, perhaps?) that wouldn't have been potentially deathly to your bride. \n\nThe whole pregnancy thing, though, seems like a weird red herring (no pun intended). And you're a bit of an AH for even agreeing to let them have something the bride was deathly allergic to in the first place.", "Esh she\u2019s is horribly allergic it\u2019s her wedding as well with or without the pregnancy she shouldn\u2019t have to worry whose around her that being said you shouldn\u2019t of agreed in the first place and of you said to your sister how you wrote you were unnecessarily rude and your family shouldn\u2019t have be pressuring to allow this", "INFO: Why does the pregnancy announcement change anything?\n\nYTA, You were cool with them having it discretely there before as long as it was away from Julie, why has that changed? I would say n t a if you had told them from the beginning, but agreeing then switching later is rude if there\u2019s not like an amazing reason. It doesn\u2019t seem like whether or not you announce the pregnancy would affect the likelihood of her having an allergic reaction to them eating fish in the corner.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The fish sandwiches bit was mostly Julie giving in as she adores the kids, but with her now being pregnant she is getting very cautious and is at a point of switching full vegetarian for the entire pregnancy and while feeding our child as she is terrified of harming them.", "My sister believes pescatarian diet means you have to have fish or seafood with every meal, I am not happy about my nephew's choice of foods either as all I see them eating is either some deep friend fish and chips, fish fingers, seafood sticks or any of the above with bread. Or different sweet food with bread. The only healthy option is ramen, but again it has to have either prawns, or calmari, or fish for them to eat it.", "Vegetarian dish is ratatouille which was super delicious at a tasting. My dad is a big meat eater and he chose it over the meat option, which in my opinion was equally delicious.\n\nMy nephew's were going through a picky stage where all they would eat was deep fried food, fish fingers, fish and chips, fish with bread or bagels, or a lot of sweet food. It didn't help that my sister and my BIL took being pescatarian as eating fish/seafood as a part of every meal. The only healthy thing they would eat is ramen, but again it must have prawns or calmari or other fish in it, as they don't like tofu replacement.", "Ohhhh, I think you are being awfully optimistic about Kate changing her tune post-pregnancy announcement...", "I wasn't happy about fish sandwiches either, but when we were in process of making the choices Julie kinda agreed to fish sandwiches as she adores the kids. And I was hoping they would come back eating something more or less healthy by the time of the wedding.\n\nWith Julie's pregnancy she is carrying another human being, so it will essentially be risking 2 lifes if something goes wrong. And some bits in her family history makes things more complicated then they should.\n\nShe has a few valid work reasons why she can't announce the pregnancy sooner, mainly due to the way her boss behaves and due to potentially loosing a lot of money from her bonus payment if she does it before the wedding, which is not something she wants to do.", "They\u2019re allowed to change their minds since it\u2019s their wedding.

Originally it was agreed that my mum would look after my nephews and make sure they brush their teeth and wash their hands after eating and it was Julie more or less giving in to the sandwiches as she loves kids. Now as she knows she is pregnant she is being very cautions and doesn't want to take any extra risks, but is too nice to tell Kate about change of plans.
