I wonder where everyone is \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nAnyways\u2026 question for the amazing mod team.  I\u2019ve sporadically noticed that posts asking about situations where OP cut off someone are removed for Rule 11.  Why are these posts not allowed in this subreddit?", "This is not nearly as fun as the OF I was promised. :(", "Haha same", "> The following posts are forever banned:\n\n> AITA for breaking up with/ghosting/cutting contact with _ (or not)\n\nA lot of OPs like to hide this question behind a different phrasing, such as \"AITA for putting my foot down\" or \"AITA for how I reacted\". Bonus points if they use one that would break the rules anyway if it were genuine, such as \"AITA for being upset\". \n\nBut yeah, most of the time, the real question comes down to \"I broke up/cut contact with someone and now want a public vote on which of us was worse\".", "I've been reading threads in this sub for quite a while before creating this account and one thing that strikes me is how unreasonably nasty some of the judgements on here can be. \n\nA decent portion of the posts made on here are what I would consider to be disagreements where one/both parties have committed fairly minor infractions.  There really aren't a huge number of posts that I read on here which make me think \"wow, that guy/girl must be a real piece of shit\". And yet pretty much invariably, at least a few of the top-rated comments will be absolutely scathing in their judgement of the party deemed to be the asshole. People will be told that they evidently don't give a shit about their partners because they were late picking them up. People will be told that they should break up with their partners because they acted somewhat petty on a single occasion. \n\nIt's frankly a bit ludicrous. I'll be honest, I've never had a conflict happen which I'd have wanted to post on here. Even if I were to, though, I'd be completely put off by how fucking cruel some of the judgements on here are. Don't know if this has always been the case here or if it's a recent phenomenon but I'd say it really kills the spirit of the sub.", "One thing I don't understand on this sub, is why other commenters get so personally offended when you have a different opinion on something.   Our views are shaped by our experiences, and people have gone through different things that will cause them to view a situation through a different lens, and then render a judgment accordingly.  Yes so many people will read something and resort to name calling because they disagree with you.", "Because who you chose to allow in your life, and other issues of consent, isn\u2019t really up to moral arbitration/judgment. If they want to be judged for an action that led up to no longer being in contact that\u2019s usually fine. But most posts like that are really asking are they the asshole", "I swear I have a situation that would easily violate that rule.  It\u2019s quite spicy too.  Ugh!", "I wish there was a time limit or limit on the amount of judgments people could get where they can make edits to their posts.  Maybe like if its been up 1 hour, or had over 100 posts.\n\nI feel like too often, a post will be up for a while, the poster is getting completely roasted with the judgements against them, then they will post an edit that tells a completely different story, along with some BS about why it wasn't initially posted.   Besides changing the context completely, if you made a valid judgment based on the information you had, then all of a sudden you get a ton of \"read the edit\" posts, or people arguing with you based on this alleged new information.\n\nThis happens enough, but its spurred by the recent \"I'm not childfree but don't want to go to my sisters childfree wedding\", which after OP got a ton of YTA responses really became \"Here is why my sisters fiance is a piece of shit that my husband hates\"", "I don't know why I'm suddenly seeing them, but im shocked at how many AITA-like subs there are. AITBF I think was made by AITA mods, but I also see AITAH, AmIWrong, TwoHotTakes (which I think is for a podcast?), and a couple more I cant remember off the top of my head. \n\nIt does kinda make me wonder why people bother coming into this open forum to complain about the rules when there are so many alternatives.", "Sure seems to be a bunch of locked threads this week.", "[removed]", "You are not obliged to date someone if you don't want to. It's that simple. This also applies to platonic and familial relationships.", "This is a thread for discussions about the sub, not for AITA posts. Those belong in their own individual threads.\n\nBut also, this part:\n\n> Is it normal to take a roof and safe living space away from your wife because you think she\u2019s having a tantrum and deserves to be punished? \n\nThat doesn't belong in your post at all, because asking for advice and starting a debate are both against the rules. \n\nSame goes for posts about break-ups. You might want to look for a better fitting sub to post this to.", "*pats\n\nMaybe you can post it over on AmItheButtface?", "[removed]", "Someone got pretty upset with me for saying most kids don't have a problem with tomatoes. People will get upset about damn near anything.", "That kind of edit usuzally breaks the shitpost rule, so feel free to report it. You're not the only one annoyed by that kind of thing, trust me.", "AmIWrong has existed for ages. Back when this sub was tiny, I was active in both. This sub just was the one to take off for whatever reason.\n\nAITAH is for people who really, really want to call someone a cunt or whatever.", "Size, I think. All 4 of those other subs you mentioned total fewer than 1 million subscribers. People want to be on the original and have almost 10 million people call them an asshole, I guess.", "Queue has been insane lately, leading to more locked posts.\n\nThe API changes fucked us in multiple ways. We're starting to get a handle on it though.", "No links in the open forum, and \"nominee\" for what?", "I\u2019m not sure I can be on the same mod team as someone with such a controversial view.", "Well, duh! Tomatoes are super problematic! Why do you think Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes is rated PG? It's the tomatoes, I tell you. Kids get nightmares from just seeing one! ;)", "Ok.  Good to know.", "Oh interesting, I didn't know that about AmIWrong! \n\nAnd yeah, the couple of times I've been on AITAH have been very wild experiences. Both on post content and comments. Going onto the other subs really makes me appreciate the no relationships rule here because my god. Idk how many times I can't take \"AITAH for dumping my partner for [insert undeniably horrific thing here]\"\n\nUnrelated, but I've always wanted an Am I the Weirdo sub. I wanna see what Werid shit people do and see how many others do it. Always thought the votes could be NTW (not the weirdo) WBH (Werid but harmless) and WAH (Werid and harmful). However I am not up to making a subreddit lmao", "I thought AITAH was for people who don't know how to spell \"asshole\". XD", "Sorry, I don't think I'd seen a monthly open forum before and mistakenly assumed this was a \"best AITA of the month\" sort of thing.", "Hah, I love that idea. Although I am well aware I am the weirdo. I did just do my impression of our dog's happy dance to my husband like 2 minutes ago.", "Semi related but some of those spin-off type subs that are basically \u201cAITA but less strict\u201d (which is totally valid, that\u2019s exactly what buttface is) are getting bigger. And as they\u2019ve gotten bigger I\u2019ve noticed a lot more removed comments and posts (same happened with us as we grew and wanted to preempt content policy violations). Which makes me wonder what the critical mass is before they get even stricter and their users start complaining.", ">one thing that strikes me is how unreasonably nasty some of the judgements on here can be.\n\nA subreddit full of dopamine starved commenters will do that for you. \n\nIt's not enough for these people to call someone an AH. They have the incessant need to tack on extra labels like \"abuser,\" \"narcisssist,\" \"gaslighter\" etc. Or they play detective and invent scenarios so they can feel like they are Sherlock when its really just them playing make believe and diagnosing someone with ADHD from a sub-3000 character reddit post.", "This sub always managed to teach me new and interesting things. Latest thing I've learned from AITA:\n\nIf someone gets in a genuine accident that crippled their family member you're totally justified in telling them that it's all their fault, that they're the reason their family member is a paraplegic, and make them cry and probably destroy their mental health. Oh, and the big reason why it's their fault and all this is justified? 1) they had low tire pressure 2) a paraphrased (and likely highly inaccurate) quote where \"they said something **like** 'the accident was meant to be'\", like they didn't even claim the person actually said that just something like that (more than likely it was that the accident was unavoidable not \"meant to be\"). Those 2 weak ass points were justification enough for OP to say something unthinkably cruel to their \"friend\" and still get deemed NTA by this sub. \n\nWhat the hell is wrong with you people? Seriously, what is wrong with you guys? I just can't sometimes, I have to hope people aren't actually this cruel and you're all just treating this sub like a deranged power fantasy where you get to treat people the way you wish you could treat them in real life. It's either that or this place is full of people with antisocial personality disorders.", "It's absolutely insane how often this happens and how downvoted a comment can get. \n\nIt seems so often that the post is something super simple like mom asked a teen to empty the dishwasher and they didn't don't because they were tired. Mom got mad.  Everyone says empty the dishwasher.  \n\nOP doesn't like the responses so amends that mom screamed, called them worthless, has been verbally abusive their whole life, and next thing you know all the original posters are being vilified for siding with child abuse.", "It turns out you need a lot less than that to diagnose ADHD. Zero characters are more than enough, it seems.\n\nNot even posted? You clearly have ADHD. You might post? BPD too. You will post, come what may? NPD. Torn between two possible posts? DID.You dont need a doctor when you have TikTok.\n\nIts the cliches that annoy me slightly more than the 'adjectives i overheard someone use' thing though.\n\n\"If someone shows you who they are, believe them\"\n\n\"It takes a village\"\n\n\"The brain isnt fully developed until the age of 25\"\n\n\u201cThe blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.\u201d", "How many times did he make you do it? When I do something like that, my husband always is like 'What was that again?' 'Really? Are you sure it was like that? Try it again, I don't think you got it right.' And there I go, doing whatever silly impression of whatever or whoever 3 or 4 times until I can't stop laughing long enough to do it again....", "I do it kind of often as it is. She always greats people when they wake up or come home with a toy, a dance, and yelling (husky mix). I take her to doggy daycare a couple times a week and it's one of my go-to dumb jokes to pick up a toy and wiggle around for him.", "Also mom is super racist and/or homophobic, forgot to mention that!"]}
