I wonder where everyone is \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nAnyways\u2026 question for the amazing mod team.  I\u2019ve sporadically noticed that posts asking about situations where OP cut off someone are removed for Rule 11.  Why are these posts not allowed in this subreddit?", "This is not nearly as fun as the OF I was promised. :(", "Haha same", "> The following posts are forever banned:\n\n> AITA for breaking up with/ghosting/cutting contact with _ (or not)\n\nA lot of OPs like to hide this question behind a different phrasing, such as \"AITA for putting my foot down\" or \"AITA for how I reacted\". Bonus points if they use one that would break the rules anyway if it were genuine, such as \"AITA for being upset\". \n\nBut yeah, most of the time, the real question comes down to \"I broke up/cut contact with someone and now want a public vote on which of us was worse\".", "I've been reading threads in this sub for quite a while before creating this account and one thing that strikes me is how unreasonably nasty some of the judgements on here can be. \n\nA decent portion of the posts made on here are what I would consider to be disagreements where one/both parties have committed fairly minor infractions.  There really aren't a huge number of posts that I read on here which make me think \"wow, that guy/girl must be a real piece of shit\". And yet pretty much invariably, at least a few of the top-rated comments will be absolutely scathing in their judgement of the party deemed to be the asshole. People will be told that they evidently don't give a shit about their partners because they were late picking them up. People will be told that they should break up with their partners because they acted somewhat petty on a single occasion. \n\nIt's frankly a bit ludicrous. I'll be honest, I've never had a conflict happen which I'd have wanted to post on here. Even if I were to, though, I'd be completely put off by how fucking cruel some of the judgements on here are. Don't know if this has always been the case here or if it's a recent phenomenon but I'd say it really kills the spirit of the sub.", "One thing I don't understand on this sub, is why other commenters get so personally offended when you have a different opinion on something.   Our views are shaped by our experiences, and people have gone through different things that will cause them to view a situation through a different lens, and then render a judgment accordingly.  Yes so many people will read something and resort to name calling because they disagree with you.", "Because who you chose to allow in your life, and other issues of consent, isn\u2019t really up to moral arbitration/judgment. If they want to be judged for an action that led up to no longer being in contact that\u2019s usually fine. But most posts like that are really asking are they the asshole", "I swear I have a situation that would easily violate that rule.  It\u2019s quite spicy too.  Ugh!", "I wish there was a time limit or limit on the amount of judgments people could get where they can make edits to their posts.  Maybe like if its been up 1 hour, or had over 100 posts.\n\nI feel like too often, a post will be up for a while, the poster is getting completely roasted with the judgements against them, then they will post an edit that tells a completely different story, along with some BS about why it wasn't initially posted.   Besides changing the context completely, if you made a valid judgment based on the information you had, then all of a sudden you get a ton of \"read the edit\" posts, or people arguing with you based on this alleged new information.\n\nThis happens enough, but its spurred by the recent \"I'm not childfree but don't want to go to my sisters childfree wedding\", which after OP got a ton of YTA responses really became \"Here is why my sisters fiance is a piece of shit that my husband hates\"", "I don't know why I'm suddenly seeing them, but im shocked at how many AITA-like subs there are. AITBF I think was made by AITA mods, but I also see AITAH, AmIWrong, TwoHotTakes (which I think is for a podcast?), and a couple more I cant remember off the top of my head. \n\nIt does kinda make me wonder why people bother coming into this open forum to complain about the rules when there are so many alternatives.", "Sure seems to be a bunch of locked threads this week.", "AITA ? \n\nSituation: have been married for nine years. Off and on marriage. Infidelity on both ends. Mine due to trauma. We had committed to making it work. He is thirteen years my senior. I stayed with him through jail and also a 16 month prison sentence, where I wrote him daily and sent money etc. \nfast forward to today. I have to move from my current place in 27 days. \nWe had secured the perfect lease!! \nNo small feat. \n\nOn the drive back from the lease meeting, I found out that my partner had spent 700 dollars on a pair of sunglasses he was \u201cgifting\u201d me. \nI asked \u201cwhy would you spend 700 on sunglasses when you know I\u2019ve been having anxiety attacks over my credit card debt you accrued as much as I did or more.\u201d\n\nHe got dismissive and rude to me. Saying \u201cif you acted right, you\u2019d get your bills paid\u201d \n\nI felt so degraded that I got out of the car and had a panic attack where I screamed and had a breakdown. \n\nInstead of offering any kindness, my partner started to film my breakdown and say I was abusing him and he was going send it to the landlord. \n\nIs it normal to take a roof and safe living space away from your wife because you think she\u2019s having a tantrum and deserves to be punished? \n\nI\u2019m going to be homeless in LA in 27 days. \nMy husband says this is my choice bc I had a \u201ctantrum\u201d \n\nSide note: I have serious trauma and complex ptsd diagnosis. This plays into my \u201cmental break downs\u201d \n\nI can\u2019t understand why he believes to contact the landlord was ok. AITA ?????", "You are not obliged to date someone if you don't want to. It's that simple. This also applies to platonic and familial relationships.", "This is a thread for discussions about the sub, not for AITA posts. Those belong in their own individual threads.\n\nBut also, this part:\n\n> Is it normal to take a roof and safe living space away from your wife because you think she\u2019s having a tantrum and deserves to be punished? \n\nThat doesn't belong in your post at all, because asking for advice and starting a debate are both against the rules. \n\nSame goes for posts about break-ups. You might want to look for a better fitting sub to post this to.", "*pats\n\nMaybe you can post it over on AmItheButtface?"]}
