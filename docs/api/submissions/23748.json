I\u2019ve sporadically noticed that posts asking about situations where OP cut off someone are removed for Rule 11.  Why are these posts not allowed in this subreddit?", "This is not nearly as fun as the OF I was promised. :(", "Haha same", "> The following posts are forever banned:\n\n> AITA for breaking up with/ghosting/cutting contact with _ (or not)\n\nA lot of OPs like to hide this question behind a different phrasing, such as \"AITA for putting my foot down\" or \"AITA for how I reacted\". Bonus points if they use one that would break the rules anyway if it were genuine, such as \"AITA for being upset\". \n\nBut yeah, most of the time, the real question comes down to \"I broke up/cut contact with someone and now want a public vote on which of us was worse\"."]}
