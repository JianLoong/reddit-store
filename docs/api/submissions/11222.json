Most of these have been preventable do the adults had been more diligent with the safety of the dog and child. \n\nI worked in veterinary for 10 years and am a HUGE advocate of teaching children(and adults) how to speak dog language and how to respect personal space. Also, to never leave dogs and small children alone together. No one should be subjected to children who don\u2019t respect another\u2019s personal space, least of all a dog who has no other recourse than to bite when they eventually get fed up at having their other messages ignored. If you\u2019re sister can\u2019t teach your kids to be respectful of your animals then she doesn\u2019t get to have you babysit for her.", "NTA.

Lean into it. \n\nWhatever the stats are about how little kids ask parents for something 32 times (or however many) before they cave - your sister clearly has not grown out of this phase (which, since she has kids of her own, makes clear why they are such brats.
