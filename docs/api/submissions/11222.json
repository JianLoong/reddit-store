You could've just said no instead of \"fuck no\", that's true.

It\u2019s not intended to be overly harsh, it\u2019s just part of my diction. I\u2019m guessing you are similar. You said no, she kept pushing, then ran and tattled on you to mommy? What is she 5? \n\nINFO: could you not offer to babysit the kids in their own home? That\u2019s usually how babysitting works, the sitter goes to the children not the other way around. It sounds like you don\u2019t have a problem with your nephews (nieces?) outside of their rough treatment of animals. You have a wife so the animals are covered. Seems like a simple enough solution. That does not change that \u201cno.\u201d Is a complete sentence and you are under no obligation to babysit if you do not want to.

You are looking out for your pets' safety.  If her kids can't handle being around pets, they shouldn't be in a place with seven dogs.

It probably would have been better to err heavily on the side of kindness, with something like \"Oh man, I'd LOVE to see my adorable nieces and nephews but sadly, I'm unable to babysit due to my current obligations to my pets. I hope I can visit them at your place soon, though, or maybe I can take them to dinner some time.\" Hard to say you're an AH if you're expressing regret at your personal limitations. I also am hopeful that they aren't as monstrous now, having reached the age they have, and could now be decent to spend time with, and act appropriately gentle with pets.\n\nBut grand scheme? Definitely NTA for the gist of your message, your sentiment towards your sister or her kids based on your prior experiences with them, or your commitment towards making sure your pets are comfortable and treated appropriately in your care. It speaks volumes about her character that, at your ages, she felt it appropriate to threaten to 'go tell mom' on you. Eyeroll.", "Your adult sister threatens to \"tell Mom\" because you won't babysit the children she chose to have? This, despite not bothering to teach her children how to treat animals with respect and care. But she wants to subject your household of pets to her poorly behaved children?  If she doesn't already realize why no one wants to babysit, there's no nice way to get the point across.
