You agreed to share accounts, she backed out without warning, stole your money, and expects to still use yours which isn't acceptable.  If she wants to call you petty, then so be it.

This is your problem?", "NTA\n\nMom should have communicated better. Before OP sent the money, OP could have asked her mom about the account, but I can see where that can sound pushy.

Again, you didn't provide any other details so it all does seem a bit silly over $10. \n\nI mean absolutely no offense, but If you're struggling for money to the point where $10 makes a major difference for your special needs child then you should probably give up some of the streaming services anyway.", "I know", "I understand what you mean about people immediately jumping to you know losing contact with your family I definitely understand that but if you read through some of my comment replies to people it's not exactly the $10 that mattered as much as the principle of the fact that she could have told me at any time that she had no intention on paying it", "Sounds like you just want to argue for the sake of arguing, in which case, YOU need to grow up. Idiot.", "I totally get that it's the principle that matters. I'm not saying that you shouldn't be mad or disappointed that she never told you she had no intention of paying the Hulu bill. I still find the whole situation odd and slightly silly though.\n\nIf you knew she was struggling and you wanted to keep watching Hulu, you could've just paid for your own account since you say the money isn't the issue. She definitely should have told you that she wasn't planning to/didn't spend the money to pay the bill, but it also seems like you just suddenly sent it to her without really asking. \n\nChanging the passwords and cutting her off of the other shared streaming accounts you pay for is a reasonable solution, I guess.
