Your ex is abusive towards his son by involving him in the discussion, it's manipulative.\n\nYou are only responsible of your son and it's not your fault that his dad is struggling and can't feed him. You are not \"depriving\" them of food : your ex is not your responsability.\n\nYour son is having a hard time and doesn't understand why you are not willing to help someone he deeply loves.

You need to know that I divorced that man for a reason. Ask yourself why there is no one in his life to help him. That has nothing to do with me. If he cannot feed you, then you should stay here. But do not ever think to try to force a victim to support their abuser. I will not. there is no moral obligation at all to that end.

Your ex is the AH for weaponizing your child to manipulate you.", "NTA! Your son is not seeing the big picture because he is 18 and will never understand your feelings and what led up to this point. All he knows is his dad is sick. To some degree your son also knows you to be the responsible one so he, too, is looking for you to save the day, I am certain, yet again. Your ex and his doctor should have researched viable options for someone who can no longer work but still needs financial assistance. There are a whole lot of resources he can access for said assistance. Your son should be helping him find solutions and assistance instead of always looking for you to fix it. NTA in any capacity. He stole from you, was abusive, a bully and controlling. It's not your responsibility to take care of someone who was incapable of being a decent human when he had the chance. Give your son a prepaid card for groceries for himself for the week or you buy him the foods he likes and send it over with him.", "NTA. 18yo can get a job.", "Nta.

Also social services are there for people in his situation. Not your husband anymore. Not your responsibility. You need to have a sit down with your child.  It is wrong of your child to treat you this way.  Also have a talk with the dad and tell him to stop. Do not discuss this further with your child.  Explain how they are hurting you and tell them you will not talk about it again. No means no. Your reasons are valid. Theirs are not.", "NTA - You owe him nothing, as far as it affects your child, you could help him out by getting sole custody so at least the child can eat.  That should be your contribution only.", "Okay it looks like your kid is in college so there's no legal reason for him to be spending a week living in a house with no power and no food, so I think that actually absolves you of making sure he's eating, esp since he does have his own money.

You don't owe him money.\n\nI have no advice to give you concerning your kid.

This is about you lending money to benefit your child. As your child says you're depriving him of food. How after hearing your child say they aren't eating you're not willing to help. \n\nBecause it's not your \"week\" it's not your problem.  Again nothing to do with your ex but why sit back and watch your child suffer", "NTA\nYour child is an adult now and should have more compassion for you after going through an abusive relationship. Your ex needs to figure his own stuff out. Don't unblock him.  Please explain to your son what your relationship was like and why you don't want to contribute to a man who hurt you so badly.

You are no longer responsible for him.", "NTA but you're going to have to make a choice.\n\nIf you want your son to stay close to you, you're going to have to help your ex out somewhat.  Your son DOES think you're an AH because your son doesn't know what you went through, and he's not mature enough to get it.\n\nMaybe send dinner home with your son when he goes back to his dad's.  Give him $100 on a gas card.  Do some SMALL things not for him, but because you love your son.", "Is your son aware of what happened in your relationship? It\u2019s likely that your ex is filling his head with lies. \n\nHaving a parent going through cancer is horrific (been there) so I imagine your son is frightened and going through a rollercoaster of emotions. Add in the emotional manipulation from your ex and you\u2019ve got a scared, angry and confused kid. For the sake of your relationship with your son, he needs to understand your reasons.", "No, not giving you formerly abuse ex money does not make you and AH.  You'll never get it back.  If your son really cannot get enough to eat, you might consider sending over some groceries , food you know is healthy and that your son likes.  kt", "NTA. OP, I would sit down with your child and say, \"I know you love your dad, but he was incredibly abusive towards me. I've tried really hard to shield you from just how bad things were, but there's no world in which I'm going to help a man who did those things to me. But, because I love you, I've compiled this list of places he can go to for help, which are places specifically meant to help people in your father's situation. These are the places he should have been reaching out to this whole time and not the woman he abused. I love you. I'm glad you love your father, but you're eighteen. You're not a child. As hard as it is for you to understand, you have to know that I have a different relationship with your father than you have.\" \n\nIf that isn't enough, I would bring up an example of someone he had a major falling out with. Ask him, if that person abused him too, why would that person ask HIM for help out of all the people in the world? Would it be appropriate? Would your son help?\n\nI would do this because then you helped, but YOU didn't get personally involved. You also just need to be honest with your kid and have a real conversation. Maybe even use it to bridge a discussion about how your child is doing with everything. Does he think therapy might help?", "He is taking a final shot at his ex-wife before he dies. Ruin the wife/son's relationship would help him die happy.", "I don't think the ex is turning the kid against OP. The child doesn't have food when he's at his dad's house for a week. When asked for money so her child can eat she says not my week not my problem. \n\nYes the father should be providing food. But this child is old enough to realize his mother is choosing being petty while he's suffering", "Love it", "BOOM!!!", "\u201c\u2026.and you get s job and support him if you so wish\u201d!", "I'd add directions to local food pantries and mutual aid organizations if he really wants to help his dad with food.", "No need for sole custody since their child is an adult.", "This is exactly what is happening and mine and my sons relationship is falling apart because I won't give his dad financial aid and show no sympathy for his dad. To be honest I have never told my son about the abuse because he has a close relationship with this dad and I have never wanted to be that person to bad mouth his father or drive a wedge between them. All my son knows is that we didn't get along.", "Their child is 18yo, so no need to adjust \"custody\" since their child is an adult. But the ex is definitely the AH for manipulating their child like that. It might be good for OP and their child to go to family therapy together.", "Because my son is an adult and not suffering or going hungry. I give him money and His dads house is 10 minutes away and he can come around to mine and eat at mine any time he wants. My son also has a part time job and his own bit of money and he uses that to buy bits of food and eat out with his friends. He is only on a low wage though so can't give his dad much. This is why I have no guilt or sympathy when I'm told they are not eating because I know 100% my son is. It is purely a tactic to make me feel sorry for his dad.", "So much this.", "My Child is not a child but actually an adult, he's  18 years old in college and has his own part time job, he will probably be in university soon. His dad lives 10 minutes away and my son knows he can come to mine any time if he's hungry. Also, my son eats out all the time with his friends with his own money. I know for a fact that my son isn't going hungry when he's not with me and he is just saying that to make me feel sympathy for his dad.", "she can give the kid money, then. ex wants money for utility bills etc. he can go fuck himself", "Mom is not being petty. You are an idiot.", "This!!!!  The ***young man*** is old enough to understand reality, both the reason for the divorce and the reason he can get a job if it's that important.  Otherwise, the ***young man*** needs to decide for himself how he wants to live.\n\nNTA.  Your ex is gaslighting you through your son.  No question about it.", "It's time to explain the abuse to him. He has an inaccurate picture of the situation now because the abuse is a key part of why you're not willing to help. He's an adult, you don't have to protect him from the truth of what you went through. You have to decide what level of details are the right choice for your situation, or if your son is already so poisoned against you that he would try to argue the details and say you weren't abused. In that case, you could just leave it as, \"I didn't tell you because I wanted to protect you, but he abused me financially and physically, very seriously, for 8 years\" or whatever the case may be.", "You need to tell him.", "Ah.  I thought he was 16.", "Exactly.  Dad is a bad role model.  He is teaching their child how to manipulate people with guilt. Child can feed dad with the money he is using to go out with friends if it is that important to him.  Why is his need to spend money when out with friends  more important than her need not to have anything to do with her abuser. The child needs to answer that question.", "Pick the child up every time.  Feed them.  Then drive them back to dad. Enough of this crap.", "The kid asked and she said no. I agree ex might have been an asshole. But if your child calls you and says they aren't eating is your response going to be like OP? Block the other parents number and say it's not your problem", "i would absolutely make sure my kid gets fed and has everything they need, but i would be EXTREMELY concerned of the ex stealing the kid\u2019s money and using it on themselves", "But that's not what OP is doing. She simply says it isn't her problem. I'm not saying the ex is a good person. But doesn't sound like OP is that great either that when her son says he's not eating because his dad can't provide her response is I'm tired of hearing it.  \n\nHer hate for her ex seems higher than her love for her son.", "ok say you send your kid to dad\u2019s for the weekend and give him $100 for food. he comes back and says he ate table scraps because dad needed that money for rent. what now?", "It's a simple solution buy groceries. You're saying all these what ifs but OP is simply doing nothing.  Also this isn't just a weekend it's entire week. \n\nSeriously if a parent knows their child is eating (even if it's not their custody week) and does nothing to feed their child would you consider them a good parent?", "youre acting like the ex is going to keep his hands off the money and thats pretty naive.\n\nThe child\u2019s dad can\u2019t afford to feed him, he shouldn\u2019t be under his care then.", "Uhhh I'm pretty sure neither of us know him. So seriously how are you acting like you would know what would happen. \n\nAll your responses are well the ex is a bad person. \n\nI'm not saying yes or no because thats not the point I'm saying. It's simply that OP knows her child isn't eating and saying it's not her problem. So I'll ask this what is your opinion on that. Not about what the ex did or might do. That OP is saying she is sick of hearing her child isn't eating and asking for help. Like you said you wouldn't do that to your child so why are you defending her so much?"]}
