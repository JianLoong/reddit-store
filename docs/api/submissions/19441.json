My mental health is not my fault, but it is my problem to manage. At the very least, I would have offered to pay my share and apologise for the inconvenience.\n\nHere OP wasn\u2019t antagonistic, just disappointed and a little frustrated. Understandably so.

Anxiety, broken foot, someone's death - sh*t happens, but a good partner would at least not allow you to financially suffer.\n\nYou really want to be with someone who treats you this way?", "Info. Are you asking for 1/2 or all the money ? And could you not go without her ?", "NTA. \n\nIf you are asking for her half of the money. \n\nBut I'd find a friend and go without her. Her anxiety is going to put a kibosh on a lot of stuff in the future. And you are going to need a  plan to to live with it. Either you will not do stuff you want or you will need to find others to do them with you because her anxiety is going to get worse if she doesn't get it treated.", "NTA but NEVER plan and pay for another trip with your gf. Simply tell her that you will not take that financial risk again. You can say this nicely and calmly but stand your ground. If there is a risk that trips might need to be cancelled because of her anxiety then she should bear that risk. Again, no need to be nasty or belligerent about it, just be factual. Tell her you'll transfer your half to her on the day you depart for the trip. Life is about learning from experiences. This lesson cost you 250 pounds.  \nIf she would like you to pay your half up front (which is fair) do it on the basis that you will still go on the trip even if she needs to cancel.", "INFO  \nDid you know she had anxiety about trips like this? Did you know this was a potential outcome? If so, how come you've apparently never discussed what would happen in the case of monetary loss?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

For example, my dog needed $4000 surgery on her leg, so I opted out of a cruise I had planned to take with friends later that year. It was an easy decision, tbh. So you could dine out half as often as you normally do until you've saved back the amount the trip cost you (\"sorry dear, I can't treat you to dinner more than once a month for the next 4 months as I need to recover the money I lost on the trip we couldn't take\", for example). No anger or judgement, just the simple fact that you want to recover wasted funds.", "NTA. She canceled the plans the day that you were supposed to leave so you probably didn't have time to invite someone else. I would honestly never pay to reserve plans in advance with someone like this. She claims her paying for a lost deposit is \"you using her anxiety against her,\" so if you pay, that means it's okay if her anxiety is used against you?", "Info: would you ask her for the money even if you ended up going?", "NTA\u2026and you might break even by breaking up with this \u201csensitive \u201c little girl.   Don\u2019t waste your time anymore\u2026this is BS is bound to happen again.", "YTA\u2026.would you be asking for the $ back if she was sick with a fever and vomiting? I, guessing not.  Why is this different?", "Info: had the money issue been discussed beforehand? Ie for the other trips, did y\u2019all go 1/2 or agree to split costs / expect a reimbursement for upfront costs?", "When you initially booked the holiday, were you expecting her to pay 1/2? If so, then maybe you can ask for the money back. \n\nBut if she suffers from anxiety, something out of her control that you knew about, it\u2019s unfair and insensitive to punish her financially by asking for money back- especially if you had originally planned it as something you were going to pay for. Illnesses are out of our control & her intent wasn\u2019t malicious. But you acting like this might make her see you differently now.", "YTA, you never told her she needed to pay so why does she need to pay now? I do think that is wasnt nice of her to bail on you last minute but i think with this amount of money spent she would certainly understand if you had taken someone else to get use out of yout money", "YTA - you spent the money and made these Arrangements WITHOUT having a discussion with her about who's going to pay for what. Why is she expected to pay some of this portion of the trip when you didn't even say in the beginning that it was your intentions to go half? At that point she could have declined all together and you guys wouldn't even be in this situation. Fault is on you. And you are holding this against her like holy hell read your post dude you expect her to pay you back for a trip that was entirely your idea that you paid in advance for without her knowing.", "NTA Your GF sounds like she\u2019s a bit much.  How can you ever plan a trip with her?", "OP said they previously went on weekend trips, not sure if this one was different in some way though", "I mean I would.. shit happens but when you spend so much money the least she could\u2019ve done is pay half for the cancelled trip", "Because just \"feeling anxious\" is not quite the same thing as being verifiably ill.", "Okay, I don't know what post you read, but it wasn't the same one I read. Op stated that he showed her everything they'd be doing to make sure she was comfortable doing and she said yes, it looked amazing. Then he paid for it. Also, Op specifically stated that he asked her to reimburse him because she canceled the day of the trip was to start. \n\nOn to the question, ESH. I personally wouldn't have asked my SO to reimburse me even if they canceled at the airport. I also would have offered to pay my SO back as I was canceling because I was canceling. It's my belief that it's the right thing to do."]}
