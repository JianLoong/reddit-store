They've had more than a year to do what takes a couple of months. They had no issue with leaving the apartment on your shoulders, so if they freak out just point that out. And remind them that they can leave too. Just as leaving would be your choice, staying would be theirs.", "NTA - get out. Give your roommate notice and leave. How many months do you have on your lease? Don\u2019t let this person guilt you into staying in a situation that isn\u2019t healthy for you.", "NTA !!! They are not your friend if you're telling them how bad it is for you there and not meeting your needs and they do nothing about it. They're just a roommate and roommates move out all the time. However, I would find someone to take over your part of the lease or give them some time to find a new place themselves.

Start looking for your new place and give them reasonable warning before moving out. This is not your friend. This is someone who now finds you simply convenient to live with.", "As a reader I'm disappointed there's no info on why the friendship deteriorated. But there's no scenario where making your own choice on where to live makes you an asshole so NTA.", "INFO -\n\n1. What's the situation with the lease whenever you bring up moving out? i.e. do you bring up moving out with plenty of time before the lease ends - or at a less convenient time, like shortly before it's due to renew or right after it's been renewed?\n2. As for rent, you mentioned offering to cover their rent - have you brought up moving out *while* helping them financially (so presumably at a time they're less financially stable)?\n\nI can't think of any particular reason you would be TA for wanting to move out and it sounds like they are responding disproportionately. Especially since this conversation has come up more than once, so they shouldn't be completely blindsided by you wanting to move."]}
