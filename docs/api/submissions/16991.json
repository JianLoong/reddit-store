{"id": 16991, "submission_id": "13eruez", "title": "AITA for banning my niece to go in our house for using my makeup?", "selftext": "I (f23) has a sister (f37) who has a daughter (f13), we'll name her Pam. We moved near their house so almost everyday her kids are at our house. My nieces and I are close and I try to be the \"cool aunt\" as much as possible. Since Pam is approaching teen years, she has been curious about makeup. During her freshman year, I even bought her a tinted lipbalm as a starting point to makeup. Yesterday, I bought a new liquid blush and I asked her if she wanted to try it. I made sure to put it on my hand first before putting it on her face to be hygienic. I made it clear to her not to use my makeup because I don't like to share it since I find it unhygienic. Admittedly, this is because I have an anal-retentive personality, but also because I had an eye infection before from makeup so I wanted to be strictly clean when I decluttered and bought new ones. Earlier, I went to school while they hung out at home. When I got home, I saw that some of my makeup was disorganized. She claimed that my cat jumped on my desk and dropped them so she picked it up and put it back on my desk. I believed this and just hung out with them. But when they went home and I was finally going to bed, I found that there were 2 used wipes full of makeup stains on my bed and my white sheet was also stained with makeup powders. I looked at my desk and noticed that the box of my eyeshadow palette was slightly opened on both ends. I got all of my makeup and saw that both of my palettes in their boxes are put inside wrong. I am a control freak so I liked to put it right side up. But when I opened it, it was all flipped and not how I usually put it. The shadows inside are also full of fallouts like someone poked it. My newly cleaned brushes are used. Two of my liquid foundations were ruined. The packaging of my serum is peeling. My new beauty blender which I keep in a tied plastic was opened. It was dirty as well. \n\nI told my mother about this who told my sister. Later on, my mom forwarded a video from my sister. In the video, my sister was confronting her daughter and Pam kept insisting that it was my cat who dropped all the makeup and she just simply picked it up and organized it on my desk.  But the thing is, it wasn't organized as she claimed. It was hastily put on my desk and some of the makeup was still on the floor. Plus some of the ruined makeups were in a drawer a cat can't obviously open. I also bought those makeup for my upcoming graduation because I didn't want to hire a makeup artist anymore to save up. We also have an upcoming pictorial where I need to use those makeups so I am just completely pissed off because now I can't use some of it. \n\nI was so mad and told my mom to not invite them here. AITA for asking for \"banning\" them here just for some makeup?\n\nTL;DR: My niece ruined my makeup so I asked my mom to ban them from going to the house.", "created_utc": 1683821583, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13eruez/aita_for_banning_my_niece_to_go_in_our_house_for/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We are supposed to have them over tomorrow and have them spend the weekends here but out of anger, I told my mom not to have them over for the weekends.

I'll see tomorrow what happens.\n\nAnother edit: This is not the first time my niece acted like this. She has used my makeup before without permission and I didn't really care back then because I didn't use it that much and I didn't need it at the time like I do now. There was also a time I accidentally scratched her hamster's cage and she went ballistic thrashing my room.\n\nAnother clarification: My mom and I share a room since we are just currently renting a small house while we wait for our house to get built, so I can't really put a lock on my door like some of you suggest. But as a solution, I had put all my makeup into a makeup bag that I can easily hide when I go out. \n\nI also didn't ask my mom to talk to my sister.

She's 13, not 5, so she doesn't get a pass on this one.", "NTA, I get that she's 13, surely got nervous and acted rashly, but after u saw everything why does she keeps lying about it?? Maybe banning her from your house forever is a bit extreme, but at 13 you should own up to your mistakes...", "NTA overall but i think banning her from the house entirely is a harsh punishment for what seems like a first time offense. She's definitely old enough to know better but is still 13. If she gets an allowance i would talk to your sister about your niece paying you back for the destroyed make up. Still a punishment but one that seems a little more fitting for the crime/age.", "NTA and Pam\u2019s mother should have offered to replaced anything her grubby child broke or contaminated.", "NTA- your niece knows better or she wouldn\u2019t have tried to cover up her actions or lie about it.", "She should have to pay for the ruined makeup and ban her from your room, but banning her from your whole house may be a bit much", "Info: do you live alone?

Your niece, who is barely a teenager, was completely in the wrong for disobeying your rules, messing up your makeup, messing up your room and lieing. While a consequence is deserved, completely banning her from your house is too drastic (assuming this is a first-time offense).\n\nTo be clear, you have every right to ban her from your house and would be completely justified in doing so.

Please keep in mind that she\u2019s 13.", "You need to see someone about your \"control issues\" I think it is something more than that that will need a professional diagnosis, your reaction is not normal.  As for your niece she's 13, 13 yr olds don't really think about consequences. Banning them from their grandparent's house is not fair to them. Have your sister repay you for the makeup that is actually ruined, and she can work out a payment plan with her daughter.\n\nI'm going to say NTA, but lighten up on the girls, they don't need to be banned, just lock up your make up from now on.", "Not an a*hole for being justifiably upset and angry; your niece lied and that\u2019s concerning and unacceptable. She needs a consequence for that, maybe to have to pay you back, or that you won\u2019t do anything makeup related with her or let her in your room/bathroom until she apologizes. But YTA for banning her from the house. That\u2019s a severe overreaction and surely you realize that it will affect your relationship with the whole family, since her parents are not going to just leave their daughter at home so they can come visit. She\u2019s a kid, and you admit that you have anal-retentive tendencies. Y\u2019all need to talk this out. Punishment needs ti fit the crime. Also, am I reading correctly that you live with your mother? If that\u2019s the case, you have absolutely no right to dictate who she lets into her home. You\u2019re an adult, she doesn\u2019t even have to let YOU live there.", "[deleted]", ">I made it clear to her not to use my makeup\n\nI have a daughter who is much younger than her, and she has a ridiculous amount of makeup because it's her hobby.

I'd accept an apology if one is offered, but also be firm in her accepting that she can't act like a toddler.", "YTA the hygiene thing is a bit confusing as you said you weren't wanting to use a make up artist \"anymore \" to save money , so clearly you were prepared to use makeup that wasn't solely touched by you.  You would not have been the asshole not to allow your niece in your room anymore and to lock up your makeup , but that's your mother's house you don't get to dictate she cannot have her niece visit anymore", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We have a close bond and I really try to be the aunt she can open up to (which she does), but she really has some trouble owning up to her mistakes.

But banning is definitely extreme!  And repayment should be required.", "Or the niece and sister could just respect her belongings. She\u2019s a teen NOT a toddler.", "I already set the boundaries when I communicated to her not to use my makeup. I also gave her a reason why so she knows I am not doing it to be selfish. The moment I saw the mess, I called my mom but since it was night she was too tired to get up. The palettes, I cleaned right away but those that can't be saved, I gave it to my mom like the foundation. She took pictures and sent it to my sister.

The makeup products that can't be airbrushed I just planned to provide for them like mascara.

And we are renting the house tgt.", "Yeah sorry about that, my emotions were intense earlier and didn't communicate properly about the banning part. But I did want to see if my feelings were valid since makeup can be seen as superficial and she is a teenager. I just don't like it when people don't respect my privacy. This isn't really my mom's house. We are all renting it while we wait for our house to get built.", "I plan on buying a bag lock instead since this is just a temp setup! :)", "Nope. Not the close aunt, the aunt who refuses to be taken advantage of.\nNTA", "Tell her that when the opportunity comes up.", "Okdoke that makes sense . Renting the house means you can ban her from your room, not the house , just the same as if it was your mum's house .

They aren\u2019t super expensive and you\u2019ll eventually want one to keep your important documents like your passport, vehicle deeds, SS card, etc. I know some people use their bank security deposit box for this but as a widow I\u2019m against this. This is only bc if anything happens to you, unless you\u2019ve named successors/co-signers (can\u2019t remember the proper name) your legal heirs can\u2019t open a bank security deposit box without a court order.", "Edited the comment for more clarifications. But yes! I will definitely talk to her and my sister about it. But I think I need to have some time over the weekends first to pace myself.", "I'll reconsider this when we move into the house! It's such a hassle when you have so many items to bring so it'll be better if I buy once we move in. I'm graduating in June so thank you so much for this tip!", "See if you can't get a lock for your room", "It seems to me like your issue is bigger than your niece; you are sharing a room with your mother so of course you feel like you don\u2019t have privacy. It can be a pretty stressful living situation and your niece (while also sucking here) might be the brunt of it here. It\u2019s ok to ask for some alone time. But it doesn\u2019t have to be a punishment, just a need from your end that your family can hopefully respect if communicated correctly.", "As someone who's big on privacy, it is a challenge to share a room. I just thought I could've handled it better. I just hope the house finishes soon lol. But thank you (and to the other comments as well) for setting me straight! I guess I need to figure out now how I will communicate this to my sister and niece and what solution we can do.", "NTA. \n\nStore your makeup out of access for niece.  Sit down with her and explain why lying isn't the right solution. Ask niece what she sees as an appropriate punishment - it may surprise you.  Go on a shopping website and show her how expensive it is.  Teach her about contamination.  (she wouldn't use an opened period product would she? ).\n\nI'd have her do work to pay you back,  half hour minimum increments.  When that's finished,give her the ruined makeup but don't tell her that beforehand.", "NTA but a full ban  for someone you were close to is a bit rough all round. tell your sister of the proof you have-the cat used wipes?- see if she'll offer to pay for some of the ruined stuff. but elt your niece know you're upset that she betrayed your trust and then lied. if you're the 'cool' aunt she'll be even more upset that she damaged that situation and can learn from it", "Are you perfect have you ever made a mistake in your life?", "Right, if OP's mom thinks it's \"just some makeup\", then she can \"just pay for it\".\n\nAlso, eye infections are no joke! Don't share makeup, people.", "If hiding your stuff doesn't work, I recommend a tool box with a lock. It's how I made sure the kids didn't get into medicine when they were little. (Much younger than your niece.) Ideally, you shouldn't be the one having to pay for it, but it sounds as if the rest of the family isn't taking this seriously. Even young children know that destroying someone's stuff and lying about it is wrong.\n\nI've had to toss makeup for an eye infection. I don't share.", "Nta but misguiding. You are very valid but you have to actually do something about it and not just \"feel\" and leave. Also you're her aunt, she thrashed your room and threw a tantrum. You didn't hold her accountable? You are spoiling her.", "Spring for a wall safe to be installed in your new room.", "I've mentioned this as a solution to similar posts.\n\nGet yourself a footlocker (or smaller) and a lock.\n\nPut anything you want your niece not to touch in the box and lock it up. Keep the key with you, not lying around somewhere.\n\nDon't bother hiding your makeup, lock it up.\n\nIf anyone (aka your sister or niece) asks tell them you need to lock up your valuables due to people who don't respect boundaries."]}
