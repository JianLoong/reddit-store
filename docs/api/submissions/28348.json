Notably, they probably haven't provided you with a receipt justifying your expense, so that might also be considered in kind.  \n  \nI wouldn't go over there for dinner much at all either, it's certainly inappropriate. The lapse of time can definitely make a difference here. You're probably justified in your expectations not to pay. You always have the option of telling them to pound sand about the bill, but if you don't want to rid them to the badlands it's probably not worth it and just a lesson learned.  \n  \nI'll grant you a NTA in light of the further information provided.", "If you know the deal ahead of time it's pretty asinine to claim you expected otherwise.
