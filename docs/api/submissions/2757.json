You're absolutely right - bodily autonomy matters. What you did was model excellent behaviour, show respect for him (highlighting that respect for others' bodies matters), offer an alternative that he was comfortable with and reinforce a positive interaction.

Thank you for standing up for bodily autonomy. You might be the only sane voice in that child\u2019s life because his mother is a control freak who will drive him away with her behavior. She has the size advantage now, but by the time he hits the early teen years, he will rebel and it will be bad.", "NTA - You are right, they are wrong.  But you weren\u2019t trying to overstep your bounds, just being gracious and accommodating.", "NTA for recognizing that nephew was not comfortable with a hug and finding an acceptable alternative to both of you and *way* NTA for not hugging your nephew that didn\u2019t want hugged when *you* were uncomfortable hugging him because he was uncomfortable being hugged. Lots of parents tell their kids to hug me but I always let the kid lead and if they hesitate I make sure to tell them it\u2019s OK to not hug. I\u2019ll take high fives, fist bumps, air hugs, waves, and other verbal or nonverbal acknowledgements of departure. It\u2019s just icky to force affectionate physical contact on a kid who doesn\u2019t want it.", "NTA parents should never force their kids to do that", "Not at all. You are definitely NTA. I want to smother my nieces and nephew (ages 3, 8, 8, 11) with hugs and kisses, but I refrain and always ask if I can have a hug. They always say yes, but it's important to me that's it's *their* decision to do so and that they actually want to. Affection should never be forced, no matter how much we want to share a cuddle with them. It comes back to consent--teaching children that no one gets to touch you without your permission, and I feel you can never be too young to learn that (in age appropriate ways). Forcing a kid to hug someone makes them feel they don't have control over their own bodies and that's a super confusing and harmful thing for a child. \n\nHis not wanting to hug has nothing to do with listening, so that's a weird thing for your SIL to say. Despite what she said, she can't make her children do what she wants all the time and there are times when doing so is harmful. Luckily you understand that and also understand that it doesn't mean he doesn't like you. You showed your nephew that he can trust you with his feelings and with his physical self in general, and he won't forget that. Nor will he forget how his mom made him feel, but that's on her. \n\nKeep being an awesome auntie! \ud83d\udc97", "From someone with a bachelor degree as a kindergarten teacher, thank you so much for doing this for your nephew.\n\nMega Mega NTA OP, and keep doing this for him, kids should never be forced to hug or kiss people.", "NTA - former social worker here, and thank you for supporting this child in having bodily autonomy. Too many parents think their role gives them some sort of ownership of their child and take an authoritarian approach.\n\nHer approach seems to indicate that she cares more about obedience than she does about how her child feels - or apparently how you feel as well, since she was going to force him to give you a hug after you also declined.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of parenting that produces young men with poor boundaries and difficulty expressing emotions - because if you don't have your boundaries and emotions respected as a child, why would you respect others' as an adult?", "That sister is fucking crazy. \n\n\"My child I can make them do what I want\" says every mother that wonders why their kids no longer talk to them after they leave the household.

Offering a high five instead is perfectly acceptable.", "NTA. Poor kid, having a mother like that. I've never made my kids hug anybody and have stepped in when pushy adults have wanted to force the issue. Kids' bodies aren't public property, they don't owe anybody affection (and adults who fail to see that can get bent).", ">*and she starts getting angry with me saying it\u2019s her child and she can make him do what she wants.*\n\nJeeze, he's a kid, not a handpuppet.  They'd do better to focus on getting him to do things that are actually in his best interests, instead of forcing \"cute\" behaviors that might backfire.  NTA.", "NTA. This situation is so uncomfortable. Even if this lady wants her child to give someone a hug just because she says so, she has no leg to stand on trying to compel another adult to participate.
