Your son and his friend are probably internalizing some homophobia at school or in media. Maybe have a conversation with him later in private about what he thinks is weird about it?", "NTA.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Like generations of kids before them, they need to learn how to adapt, how much things cost, and not to pay attention to toxic masculinity.  My parents wouldn't have even paid for separate hotel beds for kids even if they won the lottery.  I bet when they relaxed, they had fun talking to each other.\n\nIgnore any complaining.  They got to go camping and spend time with each other and you.  This is exactly the kind of experience a loving and involved parent should be providing.

Why do they find it weird? Have a sit down with him and have a talk about it\n\nI can understand not wanting to share with a parent as to him he wants to feel 'independent' from you, especially in front of a friend.

You might have asked your son before you booked it and then avoided the situation by coughing up the 8 bucks.", "YTA. The boys are at an awkward time in their growth.

They are 11 years old. There are multiple reasons they may be comfortable with the arrangement. \nIf saving money is your primary concern then cancel the whole trip. Otherwise talk to your son and **listen** to him.", "Dude, do you not remember being a preteen? They're just starting to feel things, experiencing body changes, and feel embarrassed by things. YTA for not recognizing that and being responsive.", "YTA This is all over $8! 11 is plenty old enough to think it's wierd to sleep with dad or in the same bed as a friend.\n\nEdit: it did say 8.

He explained that boys get nighttime erections in their sleep and don't want to accidentally cuddle up and be embarrassed. \n\nBoth boys said that they were uncomfortable sleeping in one bed. Listen to them. Try to find a cabin with twin beds for them. Or buy an air mattress for someone.", "YTA.
