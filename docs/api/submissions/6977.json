Ask her why this is so fucking important.", "NTA, she hurt you. you don\u2019t owe her anything.", "INFO - Did you come out at some event that was to celebrate her engagement or something else like that? Is it possible she felt like you were taking the attention away from her?\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t at the engagement party or some equally inappropriate time then she is definitely TA. You are NTA in that case and you don\u2019t owe it to someone who is being mean to you to do them a favor.", "NTA. Your sister can\u2019t handle the family dynamic where you get any attention. That\u2019s all I can think of. Do not make her dress.", "NTA. Why does she think she can be so nasty and disrespectful and then ask a major favor like this? It's no small thing designing and making a wedding dress.", "NTA\n\nEven if she hadn't been so rude and unkind to you, you are not obligated to design her dress if you don't want to.", "NTA at all. I do think though that if this was out of character for her maybe you should try (if you haven\u2019t already) to have a conversation with her about why she reacted that way, when she did not with other people she loves who are trans.\n\nIf you guys were close before it\u2019s worth a shot. Could it be she feels she is losing her sister by you telling her you\u2019re her brother? (Not what is happening but feelings can be irrational). \n\nYou absolutely do not owe her any favours, either way, but especially at a time when she has hurt you and not apologised.", "NTA. You have full autonomy of what clients you choose to serve, no matter the reason. Though she is a major AH for her reaction, but still.", "NTA - making a wedding dress is a lot of work, you're not obligated to perform that service for anyone, especially when they've been so rude to you.", "Obviously NTA", "NTA.  What a shame.  I bet if your sister had said, \"hey yeah I'm sorry for overreacting to you coming out, you blindsided me,\" she might have gotten you to make her dress.  Instead she doubled down and ensured that you won't help.  The level of stupidity she shows is only rivaled by her sense of entitlement.", "Has she even apologised?? You wouldnt be obligated to accept it but im curious how much audacity she has. \n\nYou also wouldnt be obligated, and wouldnt be an asshole, to not make it simply cos you didnt feel like it. i bet she expects to to do it entirely for free, and cover the costs of the materials huh?? \n\nNTA. Dont back down and dont let anybody pressure or bully you into giving in.", "NTA I would go further and tell her friends how she reacted. You don't owe her a thing.", "NTA  so, your sister insulted and hurt you then feels she can change your mind by cursing at you? Don't do anything for her.", "NTA. You\u2019re under no obligation to waste time and money on someone who treats you like crap.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She was rude and can\u2019t decide to use your for your talent when it suits her.", "NTA. Treat others how you want to be treated. Sounds like she treats others like shit and then wonders why they don't help her.

I wouldn't even speak to her.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister burned a bridge, and is now complaining because SHE has to replace it, demanding that not only do YOU have to replace it, you have to build her a house on her side of the crevasse.", "NTA indeed. And that is indeed the best response OP can give his sister.", "No, I came out by first calling to my parents, then called to my other sibling, and then to my sister, after making sure from each of them that is this a good spot to call because I want to talk about something important.  (I don't like to just text people about things I find important.) She said she's free and had nothing going on so I called.", "What I understood she thinks I came out to get our parents attention", "Oh that sucks. In that case you can tell her you can\u2019t make her a dress cos you want all the attention for yourself, so she\u2019ll have to wear an ugly storebought one", "NTA she is reaping in what she sowed. She made you feel bad but still asks for you to help? Honestly I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t laugh and tell her to fuck off.", "NTA\n\nIn the USA many businesses have signs that say, \"We reserve the right to refuse business to anyone.\" I think that covers your sister.", "NTA\n\nDoubt sister was going to actually pay for the dress. She sounds entitled and would have wanted it free.", "Nta even if you were the very best if friends.  That is a huge ask.  Will she pay you for fabric, let alone e the hours you spend designing?", "NTA.  I am always surprised how entitled some people can be.", "NTA. Amateur seamstress here: there's a reason why wedding dresses are so expensive. The fabric itself is expensive and a dress like that needs lots of it. Not counting embellishments (lace, beads, embroidery etc.) and the time to make it. And that's if you already have a pattern to follow; designing a dress is on another level. It would not be cheaper to make the dress: it only shifts the cost to you. You're nta to refuse such a commitment of time and money.\n\nThe background about your coming out is not relevant to your refusal. You are entitled to refuse service if it doesn't suit you, especially if unpaid. The background here is only to show that you are not enclined to help your sister with a multi hundreds (and probably thousands) dollars expense.\n\nWhat makes you think that your sister will be happy with your design anyway?  I would not be able to take that much pressure.", "Nah, I know she would have paid. But that's not the point", "Honestly, she would have. But that's irrelevant to me atm", "Well, I am well aware why they are pricy, I just stated it for the post sake. And about design, I'd never just do a design and then execute that idea without first showing it to the one who wants the dress (or whatever else they wants to be done.) And yes, the background is relevant to me.", "I would love to, but she is about to have a kid and I feel like if I wanna see my nephew or niece I will have to be careful about what I say.", "Yeah, I hear ya.  It's your time and skill and you wouldn't enjoy it. And she can't behave like that and exspect you to jump to it.", "Trust me Op you'll see your nibling the second she needs a babysitter and Mom isn't available...", "Tbh I wouldn't mind at all babysitting my nephew or niece since I can't have kids. (Us transgenders are required to be sterile if we want to juridically transition, but that's huge OT.)", "JFC I did not know this was a thing, today I learned and am horrified. So sorry"]}
