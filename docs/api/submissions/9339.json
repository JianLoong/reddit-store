It is going to be less enjoyable for everyone involved if you constantly have to police Lucy to make sure she doesn't hit another child or start yelling obscenities. \n\nLucy's mom started cursing you out when she heard the news? Maybe she needs to take a good look at where her daughter is learning this behavior.", "NTA. Lucy is the victim of incompetent parenting, but she is disruptive and treats your daughter badly. There is no reason to subject her to that kind of treatment on her birthday.", "Nta. Tell her you know why her kid is a little shit", "NTA. Not your daughter's fault that your SIL is a crappy parent. Nor should she have to tolerate her cousin's abuse. SIL had either better get used to being offended or get off her ass and start being a parent because Lucy's behavior is quickly going to earn her a reputation in grade school. Parents of Lucy's classmates sure as shit aren't going to entertain her behavior, neither would the school.", "Soft NTA.

Of course you want your daughter to enjoy her birthday party without being bullied.\n\nInform your mil and Lucy's mother that when they nip her malicious and cruel behavior in the bud she might be invited to events again.\n\nYou are not obligated to invite anyone who doesn't appreciate and treat your daughter with respect and civility.", "NTA Mom has to accept that when you don't teach your kids right from wrong, no one wants to play with them.

Is it possible that Lucy has a medical or mental health condition impacting her behaviors? Or is this straight-up spoiled child behavior? At 5, it could be either, but there is probably some room for compassion for Lucy while still not inviting her to keep your daughter safe. I'm not sure how the original conversation occurred, but it may help to keep the focus of your concern on the well-being of both children rather than pointing out all the bad behaviors which can make the mom defensive. You may have already tried that.", "Well, now we know where Lucy has learned it. NTA", "Nta. Lucy's mom needs to parent her child better and she would get invited to parties.

There are consequences for not parenting your child when behavioral concerns are expressed by other parents. Good Job putting your foot down", "NTA\n\nNo one is entitled to attend parties.

It is a direct result of her mother's failure to discipline or control her child, to the point that Lucy poses a physical threat to others (I mean, the kid pulls hair, hits, pinches, and bites; this is not normal 5 y.o. behavior), and poses a realistic threat of ruining your daughter's party.  And leaving bit marks.\n\nAssuming Lucy's mom isn't home schooling, soon she'll be getting a whole lot of feedback from Lucy's school.

Cousins or not why would you want your child around someone like Lucy? And why does a 5 year old know that many swear words?! Lucy\u2019s mother is clearly a complete AH, you need to cut them out of your life. You don\u2019t want your daughter growing up with someone like that.", "NTA. Even though Lucy is only 5 and her behavior is clearly the product of her upbringing, this is the consequence. If you're mean and rude, people don't want to hang out with you. Same goes for her uncivilized parents. Nope, people who can't behave are not invited - sorry, not sorry!"]}
