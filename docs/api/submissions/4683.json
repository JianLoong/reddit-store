Her stepdaughter is 16, she's got a nephew of her husband's they are raising who is 14 and she has a 7 and 5 year old with her husband. Ex-wife wanted to talk to me about college for our kids and she told me that she and her husband had told all their kids that community college would be the most affordable option for them and that they would get as much help as possible but a more expensive school would be tough on them. I told her that our kids would have that option if they wanted it because I have saved a more than healthy amount for them. She asked me why I never told her sooner and I told her because I was taking care of our children and it wasn't something she needed to know.\n\nA few days after this talk she called me and alongside her husband said that they would like me to pay child support for our kids, so that they can save more money for their other children's futures. I told her I was not going to pay her child support just so she could support the other children in her home. Her husband told me I could always offer to split the money between all of the children. I told him I was not paying for his kids to go to college. I told them I only had a responsibility to my children. I told them if they wanted to save more money, I would happily take the kids more if THEY (my kids) want to spend more time at home with me. Ex-wife called me cruel and said keeping 50-50 and paying money so our kids siblings can go to college should be a no brainer for me. I told her the day I have an obligation to help her support her entire household is a day in another universe where we never broke up. But we did and she has to accept she is equally responsible for our kids as me.\n\nThey both told me I was an ass and even though I feel like I'm crazy for asking, I must ask, AITA?\n\nETA: The courts did not order CS because I only make a little more than my ex-wife and I was well below the threshold they use to determine CS in 50-50 custody cases.\n\nI have control of the money.

That was just some guy my mom dated for a bit years ago. Not like he was my step dad.

It's part of protecting your children.  I know it's hard to think like that as someone who wouldn't act like that; but because of how greedily your ex and her husband acted upon hearing about your savings you have to think about the worst possibilities to ensure they don't happen.   They didn't express relief at you working hard and sacrificing and saving for your children, they didn't say 'we're glad you saved but we will contribute and do our best as well', they didn't react positively at all..... Instead they got greedy and told you how you could spend your children's savings on their children...... That's batshit insane. And because they brought it up right away and want you to pay child support *now* they may try to do all sorts of things to get money from you. If you don't think they'll manipulate your kids or take out college loans in your kids name but spend it on their kids then you need to read more threads in r/raisedbynarcissist and r/justnomil and the credit subs, college subs, loan subs, legal subs etc.   Justnomil won't seem to fit at first as it just no motherinlaw, but  there is so much in there about narcissists and about how one set of kids are used against the other and from siblings against siblings and divorced parent against the other.   \n     I would suggest an attorney to set up protections in whatever ways you and the attorney deem correct.   \n     And please whatever you do never tell them that you have life insurance and that your kids are the beneficiaries.

They are not.  \n\nI dual majored and got an A.S. in physics and an A.S. in math from a community college, then transferred to a 4 yr university to finish both those degrees with a B.S.  I then went on to get admitted to one of the top schools in the world for physics, where I got my graduate degree.\n\nStarting at a community college in no way detracted from my eligibility or competitiveness in a very challenging and competitive field.  What it *did* do was saved me a ton of money and allowed me to graduate with no student loan debt.  It also was one of the objectively best parts of my college career in terms of quality of education.  The professors at community colleges typically have advanced degrees in their fields and are there because they *want* to teach, and the focus of their entire job is teaching.  Contrast this with my prestigious graduate university, in which the faculty of my department included four nobel laureates, a MacArthur genius grant recipient, and so much more.  Some of the best minds in the field.  But...they don't give a rat's ass about teaching, or about any students except for those working in their labs (and maybe not even really those).  They are there to do research and bring in grant money and prestige to the university, and grudgingly teach a class every one or two calendar years because they *have* to as part of their faculty package deal.  They range from enthusiastic but usually poor/inexperienced teachers to (more typically) disinterested or even openly bitter/annoyed, unwilling participants for the time they perceive as \"wasted\" that they must spend in front of a classroom.\n\nI advocate for community colleges for everyone I know who is starting out.  The first 2 years of your degree won't include any really advanced coursework, but you can hammer out your electives with fun and engaging and interested professors, as well as have a much, much better experience and head start with the fundamental building block courses of your chosen field.\n\nSo...by all means, keep saving for your kids!  Establish that trust fund.  But also, please seriously consider the benefits of spending the first 2 years of their degree at a community college.  Community colleges by definition do not offer 4-year degrees, so they'll be transferring anyway to finish the last half of their undergraduate education at a 4-yr university, which they can list when they apply for jobs or graduate schools.  It'll help your savings for them go even further (especially since the average time to complete a \"4 yr degree\" in the US is now actually 6 years) and they'll probably get a better experience out of it anyway and have a great head start on their peers.\n\nThanks for coming to my ted talk lol", "NTA.

They give my younger kids gifts too. \n\nAnd I still think these people are tripping to suggest OP pay for their kids college", "Ask her if her hubby comes into a huge sum of money if he'll be contributing to your kid's futures?!", "Yes! I've seen other AITA posts in the past where this happened! OP is responsible for HIS kids! Also, 1. not every kid HAS to go to college and 2. the kids could go to college on a scholarship or there are work programs too. There are other options other than let's hit up the ex-husband for money.", "What does any of that have to do with OP's question?", "It's what I said. \n\nI may understand their reasoning, but OP is not a AH for not complying", "Not his monkeys not his circus", "I get where she might feel bad about that but seriously - in her home there are 5 kids.  That's a family of 7; unless she & her husband have huge incomes - that would be a monumental amount of $$ to come up with.  \n\nThere's no shame in not being rich, that's a tough thing to admit to ones kids especially if You  seems to be in a better position.", "A trust with someone besides the ex as the trustee. If the kids are minors there is nothing to stop her getting access unless there is a trusted trustee with your interests at heart.", "I knew a few of them in college. One didn't really get his act together until he was in his 30s and his money had almost run out.  \n\nI wholeheartedly endorse seeing an estate planning lawyer.  When you have the trusts and wills drafted make sure your kids know the details and how to get ahold of the trustee in case something happens to you.", "This is how I have my 8 year olds savings account. It's in his name but I'm custodian.  It's for when he graduates high school. It's not a college fund it's a start your life fund. Travel, trade school, college, possible down payment on a place of his own I'm fine with any of those choices. His grandparents have a first car fund for each of their Grandkids. My FIL wants to make sure they all have good vehicles. The rest is up to the parents.  \ud83d\ude05", "I concur. And after he has done so, make sure he TELLS HER that the money is in a trust, managed by him, but with provisions already in place to be managed by an attorney in case of his death. And I wonder if the trust can be made the beneficiary of a life insurance policy....cause that would solve the true crime potential mentioned above too! That way she knows there is NO WAY for her to manipulate her way into a single penny of it.", "You sound kinda like you feel you should be entitled to his parent's money, and that makes the rest of your story come across as bitter and ugly. Don't like it. Don't like you.", "He shouldn't have told the ex tho", "There definitely are. When I was growing up, a few of my friends had stepmoms and dads. They all had great relationships with there bio parents.", "This really is the way to go. This is what my parents did with me. Although I\u2019m an only wasn\u2019t in the same position as OP. They helped me for a few years after college as well, but they would only give me what I needed (rent and bills) plus a little spending money for food. It really helped me get ahead because I was working full time and was able to save all of my money for a home. I was able to buy my own home by 25 and they actually gave me the remainder of the money which i used for my mortgage for the first couple years. Their requirement were that I either worked full time or was in school. It really motivated me to try my best because I knew they would continue to help me as long as I was doing the things they wanted me to. Essentially paid me to go to school and save money. I\u2019m so grateful for this and intend to do the same with my future children. I understand not everyone has that luxury but definitely don\u2019t give it to them all at once, at 18 I probably would have bought a Ferrari and some exuberant apartment that would have left me broke by the time I was 20. Also OP not the asshole, you saved money like a responsible parent. If your ex had other plans that\u2019s on her..", "Yay!\n\nMy brain had to say something \ud83e\udd29", "NTA. You have a legal agreement and are sticking to it and are ensuring YOUR kids futures. Your ex chose to raise 6 kids and didn\u2019t plan accordingly. You don\u2019t have any obligation to those kids and she and her husband need to get off their high horses. \n\nI would talk to your kids though and ensure they don\u2019t feel manipulated into sharing their money with their siblings.", "That happened to my brother but in a slightly different way. His dad died when he was young and he has three half siblings on his dad\u2019s side from his step mom. When his dad died, he had a will or trust or something in the kids names for money that would be used for college, first vehicles, something like that. His wife gained access to the account and starting draining it making improvements to their home so she could list it and move out of state with the kids. \nFortunately, my parents realized what was happening and got an attorney and froze the account. Unfortunately a lot of damage had already been done, and it was only frozen until he was eighteen. The other siblings were all under 12. My brother got his portion and then the account was no longer froze, so none of the other kids ever saw the money their dad left them.", "Bud ur only a couple years away from that nightmare of a ex wife. U got this. Ignore and keep living. NTA", "nta, ur ex wife and her husband need to figure out how to get over it and get better at their own money management or whatever they have to do", "NTA\n\nAnd I would only pass the info on a need to know basis from now on.\n\nAlso if the kids do live with you more, you should sting them for child support.", "NTA. But be very careful of the money. Your kids could get bullied into sharing the money with their siblings and if god forbids something happens to you before they are adults their mom could have control of the money", "I'd be petty as F, after being called an AH by that ex's husband!", "A few years ago, this girl went on a dinner date with me. The next morning, she texts me about how her boyfriend is glad she's meeting good people.\n\n...\n\nUp until then, I'd assumed she was single. I was just thinking, \"Your boyfriend is so bad at providing for you that he's encouraging you to go on dates with other people so that they can do it? That's just... Cringe. I'm out.\"", "Wth, that\u2019s nuts.  It was her way of telling you she had a bf I guess.  Not sure why they don\u2019t just tell you upfront instead of wasting your time.", "I thought the same thing!!  lol"]}
