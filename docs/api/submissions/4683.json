We share custody of our kids 50/50 and we have been divorced for 13 years now. Neither of us pays child support because we have equal time with the kids and we split the costs of everything (school, medical, dental, extra curricular's). I opened up bank accounts for my kids when each was born and I have saved from the get go, but around 8 or so years ago I came into some money because I was injured at work and I put that money into their accounts. As well as this a relative died 4 years ago and I was left a sum of money that also went into the accounts for my children.\n\nThe money I have now saved for them will help them tremendously in their futures, whether they go to college or not.\n\nMy ex-wife remarried several years ago. Her stepdaughter is 16, she's got a nephew of her husband's they are raising who is 14 and she has a 7 and 5 year old with her husband. Ex-wife wanted to talk to me about college for our kids and she told me that she and her husband had told all their kids that community college would be the most affordable option for them and that they would get as much help as possible but a more expensive school would be tough on them. I told her that our kids would have that option if they wanted it because I have saved a more than healthy amount for them. She asked me why I never told her sooner and I told her because I was taking care of our children and it wasn't something she needed to know.\n\nA few days after this talk she called me and alongside her husband said that they would like me to pay child support for our kids, so that they can save more money for their other children's futures. I told her I was not going to pay her child support just so she could support the other children in her home. Her husband told me I could always offer to split the money between all of the children. I told him I was not paying for his kids to go to college. I told them I only had a responsibility to my children. I told them if they wanted to save more money, I would happily take the kids more if THEY (my kids) want to spend more time at home with me. Ex-wife called me cruel and said keeping 50-50 and paying money so our kids siblings can go to college should be a no brainer for me. I told her the day I have an obligation to help her support her entire household is a day in another universe where we never broke up. But we did and she has to accept she is equally responsible for our kids as me.\n\nThey both told me I was an ass and even though I feel like I'm crazy for asking, I must ask, AITA?", "created_utc": 1671012054, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zln3vb/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_child_support_to_my/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
