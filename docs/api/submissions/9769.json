I am introverted and keep my interests to myself, while she is excitable and talkative, and likes to gush about her interests. I listen politely, but I just don't care about most of the topics, and the chatter cuts into my quiet time. If I cut her off, she gets dejected and pouts. I explained it comes off as attention-seeking or attempting to impress me, and it helped her cut back on the extraneous details, but she still has her excited outbursts.\n\nHer newest (rediscovered) obsession is Minecraft. I've listened to her random tidbits, I even humored her when she asked my opinion on her \"concept house in creative mode.\" Today while we were out with friends, she happily brought up her Minecraft progress. I teasingly (but honestly) said that at a certain age, Minecraft is a form of regression and shouldn't be shared so proudly and openly. She got quiet, the topic changed, but she had that dejected look the rest of the time.\n\nWhen we got home, she called me a jerk and said I ruined her excitement for the game. She complained that I'm always encouraging her to find new interests and always mocking her choices. I argued it wasn't mocking, it's a common opinion and I shouldn't be afraid to share my opinions with her. I told her I'm very close to never speaking to her again, if she continues to act like this. If her enjoyment is dependent on my opinion, she should just keep her interests to herself.

She should break up with you immediately, what a terrible partner you sound like.

I am introverted and keep my interests to myself, while she is excitable and talkative, and likes to gush about her interests. I listen politely, but I just don't care about most of the topics, and the chatter cuts into my quiet time. If I cut her off, she gets dejected and pouts. I explained it comes off as attention-seeking or attempting to impress me, and it helped her cut back on the extraneous details, but she still has her excited outbursts.\n\nHer newest (rediscovered) obsession is Minecraft. I've listened to her random tidbits, I even humored her when she asked my opinion on her \"concept house in creative mode.\" Today while we were out with friends, she happily brought up her Minecraft progress. I teasingly (but honestly) said that at a certain age, Minecraft is a form of regression and shouldn't be shared so proudly and openly. She got quiet, the topic changed, but she had that dejected look the rest of the time.\n\nWhen we got home, she called me a jerk and said I ruined her excitement for the game. She complained that I'm always encouraging her to find new interests and always mocking her choices. I argued it wasn't mocking, it's a common opinion and I shouldn't be afraid to share my opinions with her. I told her I'm very close to never speaking to her again, if she continues to act like this. If her enjoyment is dependent on my opinion, she should just keep her interests to herself. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I listen to him about his Marvel Snap and God of War or Hearthstone, law school, and he listens to me talk about Minecraft, jewelry design, dog training (he takes particular pride that my 5' self can handle dogs bigger than me better than most men can), Harry Potter,  witchcraft. I read this drivel by OP and looked at my husband like... my husband would never!!", "I currently have Race to Edge on in the background because my 5 yo is obsessed and it\u2019s something I can enjoy too. He was asking this morning about books but I didn\u2019t enjoy reading the first one to him! (It\u2019s different when you have a small kid and have to talk about how the way they act and talk to each other isn\u2019t for him to do \u2014 the series is so different! And no Astrid!). So if anyone has any input on books or fan merchandise please let me know!! (He asked for a dragon eye lense projector flashlight this morning, and apparently those exist but only in Europe!)", "You\u2019ll not regret reading them! I live the books so much, and have read them all at least twice. Now reading them again, for my son. Very different indeed, but not disappointing at all.", "Let's sit and talk about the Hidden City and if Glorfindel is the same Glorfindel or a different one!", "I love it. Mushrooms are so varied and cool!", "The way he tells her that talking about her interests comes off as 'trying to impress him' is the worst part, and honestly such an ick. Man is really just going round thinking his girlfriend is an NPC", "> Why do you date someone you have so much contempt for?\n\nWas going to ask this very question. If you aren\u2019t willing to listen to someone talk excitedly about their interests and hobbies, then do them the basic respect of *not* dating them.\n\nI hope the gf moves on, she deserves better.", "He\u2019s killing her spirit. Does that count?", "Fourth because I don't want to be left out.", "Anson Mount as Captain Pike in the new Star Trek series is my husband's and I love it so much.", "Haha, \"call me Lois Lane\" \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02, thanks, made me snort my coffee laughing... \n\nBut, also I get you, I'm female, hetero, love my guy, however, my weak spot is Salma Hayek \ud83d\ude0d... fell in love when I saw her in the movie From Dusk till Dawn, dancing with a snake and all \ud83e\udd70", "Straight guy. He\u2019s hot af. And the Minecraft\u2019s only helping..", "There was a man who was convinced that Henry Cavill had to be a trans man because how could anyone born male have such beautiful eyes? Man could not accept he was just crushing on another man.", "I am a lesbian and the guy is a work of art! We can appreciate the male body and its beauty. Doesn't mean we want to go to bed with them, but we definitely appreciate it...", "My straight male friend has told me \"That man can have my babies\"", "He is the only man my brother has ever admitted finding attractive. My brother, who is the so stuck in his obsession with coming across as masculine kinda straight cis guy, can even get down for Cavil. It might be because they share the name Henry though, he is a bit self obsessed in that way lol", "Everyone has their own tastes! My other celeb crushes are not everyone\u2019s cup of tea so I get it!", "No time to talk anyway if you\u2019re between his thighs", "I am dying. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I feel like 60 percent is underselling it", "Thank you!", "His thighs would get so tired.\n\n\nLuckily, he'd have a lot of people willing to massage them for him.", "[Emily D. Baker](https://m.youtube.com/c/theemilydbaker)", "I owed it to the victim, who the crime (kidnap for ransom) happened to at age 8, and who was then around 30, to take it as seriously and thoughtfully as possible.\n\nAnd, frankly, the man on trial had such an overwhelming glut of evidence proving he was the moron behind the severely botched plot, thankfully with no physical harm coming to her, it was nice that she got justice for the emotional havoc it threw her life into at such a young age. I think about her a lot, and I hope she\u2019s doing well.", "Go on\u2026", "Yay a fellow crocheter! I could go on about all my crochet goodness...", "\n\nExactly! My partner and I have many shared interests, but also many different ones. There have been many times where I don't know what he's talking about and I listen and ask questions because, you know, I love him?? And I know he's not overly interested in everything I'm interested in, but he'll listen because he wants me to feel respected and heard. \n\nHell, one of my best friends is a big anime fan, while I am not. I have participated in many anime and manga conversations (and watched some episodes!!) because I love her. And I'm not her romantic partner!! My other best friend loves pop punk/emo music and I have never been into it, but you bet your ass I send her stupid memes and make references because I've been paying attention! \n\nI hope OP's girlfriend realizes that she deserves a partner who makes her feel like we do.", "Oh I can talk about that. He's my favorite after all. And Gondolin is my favorite city.", "That's got to be one of the best bits of a relationship, surely? Watching someone light up and glow as they get all passionate? That's when they're most beautiful...", "I plead the fifth", "Henry Caville is stunningly handsome, and im straight as an arrow.", "My man wants to be so straight he goes back to gay again no way", "That's what relative says! \"I like to look at him, he can stay over there!\" Lol", "The amount of straight men who tell me they'd gladly bottom for Cavill is truly impressive...", "Boredom and a severe case of unmedicated ADHD, required me to find a hobby. I started crocheting when I was 24ish, as a lefty most YouTube videos didn't help. So self taught, became addicted to yarn, I have 7 Sterelite tubs, the big ones, full of yarn. Seperated by weight, every color and texture. Pretty colors too, mostly for making stuffed animals.", "And me the sixt. Dont even mind sharing here.", "You made me LOL and scare my kids!", "I'll just plead, I don't need a number.", "Me seventh cause even that i\u2019m straight maybe if i can convince him to come back as Geralt", "Me seventh please", "Septimus here. Tu es culus.", "Eighth!"]}
