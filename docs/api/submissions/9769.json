I am introverted and keep my interests to myself, while she is excitable and talkative, and likes to gush about her interests. I listen politely, but I just don't care about most of the topics, and the chatter cuts into my quiet time. If I cut her off, she gets dejected and pouts. I explained it comes off as attention-seeking or attempting to impress me, and it helped her cut back on the extraneous details, but she still has her excited outbursts.\n\nHer newest (rediscovered) obsession is Minecraft. I've listened to her random tidbits, I even humored her when she asked my opinion on her \"concept house in creative mode.\" Today while we were out with friends, she happily brought up her Minecraft progress. I teasingly (but honestly) said that at a certain age, Minecraft is a form of regression and shouldn't be shared so proudly and openly. She got quiet, the topic changed, but she had that dejected look the rest of the time.\n\nWhen we got home, she called me a jerk and said I ruined her excitement for the game. She complained that I'm always encouraging her to find new interests and always mocking her choices. I argued it wasn't mocking, it's a common opinion and I shouldn't be afraid to share my opinions with her. I told her I'm very close to never speaking to her again, if she continues to act like this. If her enjoyment is dependent on my opinion, she should just keep her interests to herself.

She should break up with you immediately, what a terrible partner you sound like.

I am introverted and keep my interests to myself, while she is excitable and talkative, and likes to gush about her interests. I listen politely, but I just don't care about most of the topics, and the chatter cuts into my quiet time. If I cut her off, she gets dejected and pouts. I explained it comes off as attention-seeking or attempting to impress me, and it helped her cut back on the extraneous details, but she still has her excited outbursts.\n\nHer newest (rediscovered) obsession is Minecraft. I've listened to her random tidbits, I even humored her when she asked my opinion on her \"concept house in creative mode.\" Today while we were out with friends, she happily brought up her Minecraft progress. I teasingly (but honestly) said that at a certain age, Minecraft is a form of regression and shouldn't be shared so proudly and openly. She got quiet, the topic changed, but she had that dejected look the rest of the time.\n\nWhen we got home, she called me a jerk and said I ruined her excitement for the game. She complained that I'm always encouraging her to find new interests and always mocking her choices. I argued it wasn't mocking, it's a common opinion and I shouldn't be afraid to share my opinions with her. I told her I'm very close to never speaking to her again, if she continues to act like this. If her enjoyment is dependent on my opinion, she should just keep her interests to herself. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
