{"id": 19561, "submission_id": "1471gdk", "title": "WIBTA for not paying for my younger daughter to go college after I paid for her older sister?", "selftext": "I (43F) and my ex (45M) have two daughters together, Fiona (22F) and Ellie (17F). Our marriage ended due to my ex's affair. After the divorce, Fiona requested to live with me full-time, and I was awarded full custody. However, Ellie was was too young to pick, so we agreed on joint custody. Unfortunately, my ex chose not to continue a relationship with Fiona and only pays child support.\n\nFiona and I have maintained a close bond throughout the years, meeting regularly and spending time together. On the other hand, my relationship with Ellie is strained. My ex and his new wife have filled her head with negative opinions about me, and she repeats hurtful things that she's heard. Admittedly, hearing hurtful comments from my own daughter has made me less inclined to pursue a strong relationship with her in the past, and as a result, I didn't see her often and we only text occasionally for birthdays and special occasions as she agreed to live full time with my ex when she was 14. Fiona has maintained a relationship with Ellie, and I rely on her to learn about Ellie's life.\n\nI am now remarried and have a stepson, James (16M), who is neurodivergent. Ellie constantly bullies him at school and makes fun of him in group chats with friends and I have seen how this upset James. This behavior has made it challenging for me to establish a healthy relationship with Ellie because whenever I've tried to address her behavior, she accuses me of favoring James.\n\nRecently, my ex reached out to me and asked if I would contribute to Ellie's college fund. I declined his request and said that since he has primary custody of Ellie, he would take care of her college expenses or that she might be eligible for scholarships, but he told me that he assumed since I paid for Fiona (he didn't contribute), I would do the same for Ellie. Currently, my husband and I are saving for James's college fund and my ex suggested that we redirect the money we're saving for James to Ellie instead.\n\nNow, I'm wondering if I'm TA for refusing to contribute to Ellie's college fund. I have reservations about financially supporting Ellie due to our strained relationship.", "created_utc": 1686508476, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1471gdk/wibta_for_not_paying_for_my_younger_daughter_to/", "score": 1232, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There should be no argument here at all.  you are NTA", "NTA - tell the dad you\u2019ll gladly match whatever he contributed toward Fiona\u2019s college funds. If that number is zero then that seems fair.", "NTA let you me ex pay for Ellie\u2019s as you paid for Fiona\u2019s without any help from him.", "ESH. Just know this will likely completely end your relationship with Ellie.", "NTA - You paid for one entire college education now it is his turn. This is not unreasonable. This should be the end of the discussion. Ellie should be told this rationale because it is not a personal reflection on her. It is a sound financial decision between parents. \n\nSeparately you can put aside money for Ellie should you both work on and create a healthier relationship. These funds will be welcomed by most kids when they need a car, apartment security deposit, dental care, house down-payment, etc. \n\nYou have not lost out on supporting Ellie you simply are not willing to support a bully and who embraces negative views feed to her by others. Fingers crossed she changes. Best to you.", "I'll go with NTA. If your ex didn't contribute to Fiona's college fund, you have a right not to contribute to Ellie's, especially since he's gone out of his way to poison your relationship with her.\n\nTHAT SAID... I think you should sit yourself down and think long and hard about what you want to do with Ellie. Ask yourself, do you love her? As a psychologist I'll tell you that as a rule, children love their parents unconditionally. However, this love can be twisted into hate and into resentment because children have few defenses when one parent poisons them against the other.\n\nSo. Do *you* love her? Do you want to fight for her?\n\nIf you love her and that is something you're willing to do, then consider asking Ellie out so you two can have a serious discussion in some restaurant or other place where the ground is neutral, and there won't be your new family or her new family around. Tell her that you will want to talk with her seriously, and lay out how you feel calmly and clinically. Tell her that she has hurt you, and accept when she accuses you that you have hurt her too. Ask her if she wants to mend this relationship, and reassure her that this won't affect her relationship with her father (though I'm willing to bet her dad won't be so gracious). If she says yes, set up therapy for you two. If she says no, tell her that the offer is always on the table. DON'T shut her down. Don't give her ultimatums.\n\nAs for the college fund. Ask her why her father wants you to contribute, when he didn't contribute to Fiona's. Let Ellie answer. I'm willing to bet it'll be a revealing answer. Then, ask her what she wants. In all of this, be calm even when she's hurtful to you, and repeat that you will only talk to her like an adult towards a soon-to-be adult, because at this time you aren't ready to talk as mother and daughter. Wait her out. **Don't give her reactions that she expects, that her father and his wife will have told her you will have. She will try to elicit them, because realizing her father lied to her about you is excruciatingly terrifying and traumatic to a child that was forced to pick parents and take sides. Therefore, it's on you to weather out that onslaught of goading and provocation, until it dies down.** Don't mention James in this first talk you have with her. if she brings James up, ask her why she feels it's becoming to her to attack a neurodivergent guy. Why she feels it's cool to be a bully and if anyone has done it to her. Who showed her how to be a bully?\n\nOnce you get meaningful answers, you can decide whether to contribute to her college or not. In the end, it's not what's important. What's important is to give her a chance to stop being raised as a toxic individual, and ultimately living an unhappy life.\n\nIf you want to invest in that.\n\nEDIT to add the bold stuff in the post", "NTA\nIt's not Ellie's fault that your ex tries to make her dislike you, however, it's extremely rude of her to bully James. Due to this, I think it's fair not to help her pay for it because it can be a good lesson for Ellie. However, you are kind of favoring James if you're contributing to his college (your step-son) while not helping Ellie, so I do think Ellie got a point about the favoring. Keep in mind, Ellie was young when most of this happened and she can't be blamed for that. This whole situation must have been very hard and confusing for her.\n\nIf you fully paid for Fiona's college it wouldn't be too unfair for your ex to pay for Ellies. However, you also have to realize what will happen if you don't contribute at least a little. If you barely have a relationship with Ellie as of right now, then you most likely won't be in her life at all if you choose not to contribute.\n\nI don't think you're treating Ellie completely fair and maybe that is why she gets more and more distant from you. However, you fully paid for Fiona's college, so then it is only fair for your ex to pay for the other child's college.", "NTA\n\nYou could contribute some money to her college fund on the condition she actively joins and engages in family therapy with you.", "There seems to be missing information.

Your ex and his new wife talk trash about you to Ellie.  You have tried to address Ellie's behavior, but with the venom coming from her father and stepmother,  it will be difficult to make her see the error of her ways.

If you pay for Ellie's college, will they hit you up to help with other major costs like a wedding.  The money you have put away is for James.  If you want to help, I suggest offering to help pay for her first year books only, or something similar.  A token gesture only for one year.", "INFO: Did your ex-husband contribute towards Fiona's college fund?", "I would have just said \u201cIt\u2019s only fair I paid for one alone and now it\u2019s your turn to do the same.\u201d He shouldn\u2019t even have knowledge of James\u2019 college fund.", "ESH\n\nWhatever the ultimate outcome here is, know that paying for one and not the other is probably the nail in the coffin of that relationship. Right or wrong, asshole or not, that will almost certainly be the outcome.", "Tell him you will contribute the same amount to Ellie that he did for Fiona.\n\nIs OP to blame for the strained relationship with Ellie? Partly but so is her ex. He's the one that poisoned the relationship so he doesn't get a pass. He should have been helping his daughter bond with her mother but he didn't. He wants OP to contibute to Ellie but where is his contribution to Fiona? \n\nEveryone needs therapy and I hope Ellie is getting the proper punishment for her bullying.", "Since you paid for Fiona\u2019s college, isn\u2019t it up to him to pay for your second child\u2019s college? Shouldn\u2019t both parents contribute to college costs?", "What a ***** your ex is. You paid for your eldest in full bc he abandoned his daughter! And now he doesn't even want to pay for the only daughter he chose to brainwash! \n\n>ex suggested that we redirect the money we're saving for James to Ellie instead.\n\nHe's a piece of work! Frick that guy! Tell him you expected him to pay for Ellie since you paid for Fiona's and remind that she's still his daughter! Sadly this will only affect your relationship with Fiona though.. So maybe give something but not from James's part bc your daughter still bullied him, brainwashed or not. NTA either way.", "NTA. He did not contribute directly to Fiona\u2019s fund. I know he paid child maintenance but that money was for her upbringing and essentials. Not for the college fund.  So it\u2019s his turn to pay for one of his kids to go to college.", "NTA- why would you pay for somebody who says mean things about you and who bullies your other child? You paid entirely for the oldest, and he didn\u2019t contribute at all, so he should\u2019ve had plenty of time to save for his other daughter!! And by saying no, maybe you\u2019re ungrateful daughter will learn that if you\u2019re absolutely awful to people, they won\u2019t help you", "If you don't have full custody I don't see why you'd be expected to pay for the whole college. They should also be pitching in", "NTA for declining to contribute. I\u2019d tell him you\u2019ve already paid for both. \n\nSince you paid for one in full without his help - should have been split - he can pay for \u201cyour half\u201d this time to balance equally. Seriously, this is fair and I think it makes sense.\n\n\nEdited to add: Or, he can pay you back for his cost he didn\u2019t pay for Fiona \u2026and then just turn around and give him the money back and advise it\u2019s for Ellie.\n\n2nd edit: This isn\u2019t about your daughter but your ex not wanting to pay for college. He didn\u2019t pay for Fiona and he speaks bad about you - as you say - to Ellie and yet wants you to contribute? Nah. Help your daughter in other ways, but I wouldn\u2019t give a cent until he paid his half for Fiona.

You\u2019re the adult, so you need to iniate this and make sure she understands that you would like to have a better relationship with her.

Make sure she knows you\u2019re there if she needs you, and that you\u2019re not paying just because you\u2019ve paid 100% of your other daughters college education without her father\u2019s help. She needs to know you don\u2019t despise her.", "NTA because plenty of kids pay their own way through college, I did so I know for a fact it can be done without parental help or joining the military, but your kid will remember that you didn't help for the rest of her life.

You are a prime asshole.", "NTA \n\nYou paid for Fiona\u2019s because he couldn\u2019t contribute? Tell him you can\u2019t contribute and since he thinks your husband can fork over money for Ellie, his wife can do the same. \n\nYou paid for one, he pays for the other. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t pay regardless.

I would say NTA, but its honestly kind of hard to tell.", "Look, it's not fair, but I would contribute 1/4 of her college education.

He needs to pay for Ellies tuitiin because you already paid for Fionas. That just fair to you. But, you as a patent to Ellie need to make sure she doesn't get neglected in terms of her education in the even her father just decides not to pay. \n\nThe relationship issue is another matter and I believe should be seperate from her education needs.\n\nI suggest some therapy together for you and her. Parental alienation is a thing and Ellie has been manipulated for years. It going to take work to build back that bond.", "Nta", "NTA. You can spend your money as you see fit. She\u2019s old enough to know how to conduct herself kindly and she chooses not to.

Seem fair to me. I\u2019m assuming he didn\u2019t pay his half of the older daughters college.", "NTA. There are two children, if you paid for one tuition fully then it\u2019s his turn to do the same. Had you split the first cost 50/50 and you refused then that would be a completely different scenario; in this case each parent would be responsible for half which is what happens when you fully paid for one and he fully paid a for one.  On another note, it sounds like you could all use some therapy to work out the family issues. Even if it\u2019s just for individual for working on the relationship with your youngest daughter.", "NTA snd James deserves a better sister.", "NTA, I don't understand how your ex thinks it's okay for you to pay for all of Fiona's tuition without any contribution from him,  but he expects you to contribute funds for Ellie?  \nIs your ex serious?

I don\u2019t like that she\u2019s bullying her step brother. But it really sounds like you gave up on your kid while she was still a kid. Your love for your kids sounds conditional.", "NTA\n\nYou took financial responsibility for one daughter to go to college. He can take financial responsibility for the other. Seems completely fair.\n\nBut you still have a responsibility to parent Ellie. The more absent you are, the more she will lash out at James. Your ex's parenting is not putting a stop to the bullying. You should be. Parenting doesn't stop just because it gets hard. She is still a minor and clearly in need of a decent female role model that she isn't getting right now. I understand that it's hard when she's cruel to you, but it's still up to you to do the work, even when she's bratty about it.", "NAH\n\nI mean, she's not wrong that you're favouring James over her but that's only because you spend more time with him. You can't have a relationship with someone who isn't around.\n\n You're the adult here, and I feel like not paying for her college fund because you don't get along is only going to solidify in her mind that you suck, true or not.\n\nWhatever you choose, you're either taking the high ground and paying for her college knowing that she may never appreciate it, or choosing James because your relationship is easier with him. \n\nRegardless of your ex you should be supporting your daughter. Teenagers are jerks by default, don't prove her right by punishing her because of your ex, she's chosen his side but she won't be a child forever, I could very well see this becoming a reason she goes NC, so if you're okay with that, that's one thing. But if you ever hope to have a relationship with her (beyond her teenage years) I wouldn't decline paying for her education. \n\nAt the end of the day, life isn't fair, and your ex may not have paid for Fiona's education, but don't you still want your daughter, Ellie, to have the best chance to become the best version of herself?", "My question is this: you paid for Fiona and her father didn\u2019t pay at all, is that correct? So now he STILL doesn\u2019t want to pay for his daughter Ellie, whom he has alienated from you. The only reason to pay for Ellie would be to (try) to maintain a relationship with her.

Maybe you can still salvage this relationship", "NTA But ask Ellie why her dad cut off Fiona and didn't pay for her at all. Maybe address the lies he and his wife told her somehow.", "I'm pretty sure Ellie is jealous of James. You also sort of sound like you gave up on Ellie pretty early on.  Sure, she is a bully, but you need to ask yourself why and remember that she isn't even an adult yet, so likely has emotional and mental issues dating back to your divorce and subsequent issues with the ex.", "YTA. \nNot only for the college,  it way more for abandoning Ellie. What you did will cost her a fortune in therapy. You showed her that you don\u2019t care about her. You clearly didn\u2019t pursue a relationship with her. You not once fought for her. What you are showing her is that you don\u2019t love her and that the son of your new partner is more important to you than her. Why do you think she lashes out at him? Think about it. He is getting all the love from her mom that she never received. \nReach out to Ellie and apologize for your behavior over the last few years and the fact that you never fought for her. Be prepared that she hates you for it and that she will no accept the apology. Be a better parent and show up for her and finally start fighting for her.", "NTA. I think it's only fair that he pay for the other one that he had custody of since he didn't help you pay for the older at all. You can pay her child support to help with her college but that would be it.", "NTA, you paid for one daughter, he should pay for the other one.

Instead of keeping the sisters together, you agreed to joint custody of Ellie because she was too young to choose, and when she was old enough, she chose to maintain the status quo and stay with you ex.  And then you say Ellie repeats things you ex and his wife say about you, but instead of confronting them, you hold her in contempt.

There\u2019s lots of room between.\n\nIF she goes NC, remember you made the choice to cut her off and not pursue a relationship.

You did not protect her. You abandoned her.\n\nYou also also letting her bully this kid in school.

You are the A for making this point, because financial support from your parents(as long as you are not capable to maintain the living cost yourself) is not bound to good behaviour. \n\nYour reasons not to pay for her are a bit weak", "YTA. Ellie is still your daughter and deserves the same treatment as your other daughter and stepson. How awful that you are willing to pay for a stepson but not your own daughter.

Our marriage ended due to my ex's affair.\r After the divorce, Fiona requested to live with me full-time, and I was awarded full custody. However, Ellie was was too young to pick, so we agreed on joint custody. Unfortunately, my ex chose not to continue a relationship with Fiona and only pays child support.\r  \n\r  \nFiona and I have maintained a close bond throughout the years, meeting regularly and spending time together. On the other hand, my relationship with Ellie is strained. My ex and his new wife have filled her head with negative opinions about me, and she repeats hurtful things that she's heard. Admittedly, hearing hurtful comments from my own daughter has made me less inclined to pursue a strong relationship with her in the past, and as a result, I didn't see her often and we only text occasionally for birthdays and special occasions as she agreed to live full time with my ex when she was 14. Fiona has maintained a relationship with Ellie, and I rely on her to learn about Ellie's life.\r  \n\r  \nI am now remarried and have a stepson, James (16M), who is neurodivergent. Ellie constantly bullies him at school and makes fun of him in group chats with friends and I have seen how this upset James. This behavior has made it challenging for me to establish a healthy relationship with Ellie because whenever I've tried to address her behavior, she accuses me of favoring James. \n\nRecently, my ex reached out to me and asked if I would contribute to Ellie's college fund. I declined his request and said that since he has primary custody of Ellie, he would take care of her college expenses or that she might be eligible for scholarships, but he told me that he assumed since I paid for Fiona, I would do the same for Ellie. Currently, my husband and I are saving for James's college fund and my ex suggested that we redirect the money we're saving for James to Ellie instead.\r  \n\r  \nNow, I'm wondering if I'm TA for refusing to contribute to Ellie's college fund. I have reservations about financially supporting Ellie due to our strained relationship.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And legitimate bullying at that. \n* And then, after having gone NC after treating a parent with utter disrespect and vitriol for no good reason, there is now an expectation on OP to reward this treatment towards her by giving her money to go to college?
