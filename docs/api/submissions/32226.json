I 26F am caught between a rock and a hard place right now. To start things out, my cousin, Angel 22M came out as transgender when he was 13 and I was 17. I of course accepted him with open arms and don\u2019t think any less of him for being transgender. He said his parents weren\u2019t exactly amused and just tolerated it. When I was in college and would come to visit, they would deadname him and use his old pronouns and my other cousins would say things like \u201cAngel wants to be a boy\u201d and \u201cShe\u2019s still a girl.\u201d My aunt and uncle didn\u2019t do anything about that and I could tell it was making Angel upset. \n\n4 years ago when Angel was 18, he had a big fight with his parents after he started HRT. They didn\u2019t kick him out, but he called me to vent and said he couldn\u2019t take it anymore and couldn\u2019t wait to move out. I talked to my fianc\u00e9, and we agreed to let Angel stay with us until he can get his own place to live. \n\nWe called back and offered him the guest room, which he gladly accepted. And he stayed with us until he finished trade school, got a job and moved in with his partner. He remained low contact with his parents, but still wanted me to stay in touch. Any time he and his parents spoke, it was through me or my fianc\u00e9. \n\nFast forward 4 years, I\u2019m 26 and Angel is 22 and hasn\u2019t spoken to his parents at all in that time. My aunt reached out to me and asked to talk to Angel. He didn\u2019t want to talk, so I told her that. She wasn\u2019t having it and demanded to \u201ctalk to her daughter.\u201d I stood firm and she asked for at least Angel\u2019s phone number, which Angel didn\u2019t want so I told her no. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t backing down, and neither was I until she stopped with me and started pestering my fianc\u00e9 about it, only to get the same results. While she was on the phone with my fianc\u00e9, I took the phone and told her to stop trying to get to Angel because it wasn\u2019t happening. If she wanted to have a relationship with him, she should\u2019ve been a better mom and accepted him for who he was with a few choice words thrown in the mix. \n\nOur extended family is extremely divided, with Angel and my fianc\u00e9 firmly in my side. I\u2019m being crucified by everyone on my aunt\u2019s side for how I spoke to her and keeping her child from her. But with some of the things they\u2019re saying to me and calling me, I\u2019m now feeling a little guilty for causing this rift in the family so AITA?", "created_utc": 1701570097, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189ja5b/aita_for_not_giving_my_aunt_my_cousins_phone/", "score": 1195, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His family unflinchingly accept me, they've not been great with him. He went no contact with his mom over 3 years ago and a big sticking point was not even attempting to try to gender him or name him correctly. My mother passed around the time he went no contact and a big thing for him was the difference in how our mothers treated us. My mother was one of my biggest supporters and there was no one she loved more than her sons. My husband's mom treated him like an afterthought and continuously just didn't respect him. His family still tries to get him to break no contact because I get that its awkward for them but I doubt he ever will, there's too much damage there. You're not keeping Angel from his parents, he's a grown adult who realized that his parents love for him was conditional. You didn't cause the rift, THEY did. You told your aunt the truth, and she needed to hear it. You're very much NTA but I would absolutely uninvite aunt from the wedding. Especially since I dont doubt she won't be aggressive with Angel.

If they did, then they were somewhat sympathetic/supportive and I would say that you only added to the drama by implying that Aunt was a bad mom.

And the fact he is trans doesn\u2019t even enter in the equation. He is an adult. He has chosen not to have contact with his mother, and the OP would be the AH if they ignored his wishes. Not sure why the mother thinks that the OP is somehow the go between. Sounds like Angel has made his expectations perfectly clear to his mother. If she wants a relationship with her son then she needs to respect him, but by the sounds of it she has no intention of doing so.", "I'm trans, and let me tell you: NTA!\n\nHad you given your aunt his number, you would have been, though. It will result in you losing Angel as well, and he would never trust you again.\n\nAngel is an adult, he can choose whoever he wants to stay in touch with. Trans people get enough trash in life, we don't need to be forced into contact with parents who can't accept us. \n\nFamily is chosen, and his parents chose not to be parents to him. So he chose not to be their child. He doesn't owe them anything. Your aunt and anyone who supports her in this are AH's.", "NTA", "As a trans person who doesn't have a super supportive extended family, I want to say thank you for being so supportive", "NTA", "NTA and the abuse they\u2019re hurling at you shouldn\u2019t be making you doubt your decision, it should be reinforcing it. This is what you\u2019re catching simply for blocking access. What do you think they\u2019d be doing to Angel if you weren\u2019t stepping in? Because it would be a whole lot worse than what you\u2019re getting now. She literally just wants access to abuse him. Don\u2019t give it to her.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s Angel\u2019s decision and he doesn\u2019t want to talk to her. She obviously hasn\u2019t changed as she still refers to him as her \u201cdaughter.\u201d\n\nI do feel that Angel needs to be more proactive in setting his boundaries with your extended family. It\u2019s wonderful that you have been there for him but using you as a buffer is clearly stressing you out. If he, himself was to tell your extended family that he has cut contact with his mother and you are respecting his wishes. It not ideal but I feel like they see you as a gatekeeper and don\u2019t believe he\u2019s cut contact but if they heard it directly from him they might accept it.", "Huge NTA! You are great as family and support system!", "So big NTA here. \n\nYou did everything right. You told Angel that his mom wanted to get in touch with him, Angel wasn\u2019t interested, and you protected his privacy. \n\nYou\u2019re not just an awesome relative, but a good friend, too. I\u2019d be so proud to have you both in my family. Your aunt, on the other hand, can go pound sand.", "NTA, as someone who is 16 years NC from their parent and also trans, Thank you for being so supportive.", "Next time she asks to be able to contact her daughter, tell her \u201cYou can\u2019t contact her because she is dead and has been for a long time. Whenever you are done grieving your daughter and are ready to have a sincere conversation to apologize for how bad you were at parenting, I\u2019d be happy to pass along the message to your son.\u201d \n\nHave a script and that is all you and your fianc\u00e9 say or text to your aunt and a version to the crazy family members coming at you. Shut down that nonsense by repeating the same thing each time and hanging up. They\u2019ll quickly quit.", "NTA - however, you need to talk to your cousin because you're getting blowback which is unfair. The two of you need to form some kind of response so that you don't deal with constant harassment from the family. He was very young when you helped him out, so I don't blame him for pitting you against your family, but he's an adult so I think the two of you need to figure out what to do to stop this (maybe a strongly worded letter from him to the family, something like that)...", "NTA\n\nNot Even Slightly The Asshole.\n\nI'm always a bit skewy wrt kids transitioning, but in the end, as long as they're not getting surgeries and shit, it's just experimentation, at worst, and I'm happy it worked out for Angel, and he had such a supportive cousins as you and your fiancee.", "NTA. You are the supportive family that Angel needs. I'm so happy that he has you and your fianc\u00e9. You did exactly right. That aunt should have loved and respected Angel, and she just wants a pass for being an abusive AH. You're not keeping him from her. You're standing strong and holding a boundary. You're showing him respect, kindness, and love.", "NTA. It's been multiple years and she still won't even make the basic effort to use Angel's name/pronouns? Ugh. She hasn't changed and isn't going to get what she wants.", "You're NOT \"keeping her child from her\". Her son is free to contact his mother any time he chooses. You're simply not allowing her to harass him against his will. His crappy mom could fix the situation in a minute, but she's too stubborn.\n\nYou're NTA, none f this is your fault. And thanks for shielding your cousin from the Wrath of Mom.", "NTA.\n\nMy personal policy is to never give out contact information without permission. If my aunt wants my sibling\u2019s new phone number, I ask my aunt if I can share her number with sibling and tell sibling aunt wants them to reach out.\n\n\nFriends, parents, strangers, I don\u2019t care, I don\u2019t give out contact information without checking with the person it belongs to. (And I don\u2019t want other people giving my contact information out without asking me either.)\n\nSo before you even get to the drama, you\u2019re NTA. \n\nThe rest of your family is saying that you should go against Angel\u2019s wishes to not be harassed? So they\u2019re harassing you instead?\n\nYou didn\u2019t cause this rift. The people who made it so uncomfortable for Angel to live with them that he doesn\u2019t want them to have his phone number made this rift.", "Like one of my favorite quotes \"sometime you know you made the right decision when it's the most painful and hard choice to make yet puts your heart at peace \" nta", "NTA\n\n  For all the obvious reasons, but I think an important one is the fact that she needs to be reminded every time that it's her own  actions that pushed her son away.

The \"child\" she denigrates is 22 years old, an *adult* that has cut her off, and with excellent reason to do so. She caused her own rift, several years ago, and hasn't changed one iota, thus calling him her \"daughter.\" She made her bed, and it's a shame they are taking their frustrations out on you.", "NTA", "NTA. You're not keeping her child from her. Angel is an adult who can make his own choices, and he is choosing not to interact with his mom - given she still misgenders him, I'm not surprised. There's no rock and hard place here. You love and support your cousin, and you are showing that by protecting him. Block your aunt if she can't control herself - now she has no contact with her son because of *her* actions.", "I would have said providing a safe venue for everyone to talk would be appropriate because maybe Angel\u2019s parents has grown over the last few years, but then she demanded to talk to \u201cher daughter\u201d\n\nNTA NTA NTA", "Not only is OP the best cousin and good friend, they are a good *person*. If you can't love & support your child unconditionally (suppose there is the argument if your child was a rapist or murderer) then you don't deserve to be in their lives. Simple as that. There is nothing my child could do to make me turn away from him. \n\nStay strong OP.", "This is really the only comment that matters. As others have also suggested, might be time to go no contact with then yourself. You owe them nothing.", "Not to mention - he's an adult and can make his own damn choices. He just happens to be staying with his cousin. If he got an apartment then Mom would have no way of knowing or contacting him.", "Exactly. OP, you didn\u2019t cause the rift - your aunt and uncle did.", "Exactly. Bonus negative points for them for claiming OP is keeping a daughter away from the aunt. The aunt doesn\u2019t have a daughter, she has a son.", "The fact that you keep saying her explains exactly why you want to claim the parents were not abusive. Because continuing to refer to him as their daughter and using her deadname knowing how that makes him feel, is exactly that. If Angel has made it clear that he has no interest in speaking to them then the parents have no right to demand a single thing from any other individual. Especially the individuals that were taking care of the child they were not treating right. They are yet again putting their own wants first. There is no situation where that will fix things, only cause further, and rightful, estrangement.", "Angel is not a child, and he has been male for nearly 10 years. The fact that you refuse to see or acknowledge that means that your opinion is worthless in this case. OP is not blocking anything. There is no constructive dialogue that can happen with bigots. If Angel wants to share his number or contact his parents, he can. OP is following his wishes.", "Even better- have the number of someone no one sane would call to harrass and threaten under his name. \n\nLike their towns nonemergency line. Or their boss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey get ahold of the phone and steal his number to harrass him and get in a shit ton of trouble.", "Older folks have had decades to get with the times. Turning 70/90/ect doesn't magically negate the fact that they weren't always old.\n\nA 72 year old would have been 50 in 2001. Depending on when their birthday landed they could have been 49 on 9/11.\n\nOld people were young once.\n\nIf they haven't kept up with the times it's because they chose not to.

In fact the whole family is)", "He's not. He already moved out and stays with his partner.", "That is not abuse that is reality. A person can change the characteristics superficially, but they remain what they are. She is still a female. That biological remains true no matter how much one tries to conceal it. If I believe I am a giraffe, it is not cruel or abusive to tell me different.", "I would stop being the communicating factor between the 3. It's called triangulation and it's not healthy for you because you get caught in the crossfire. It was good when angel was still in his teens and in school as he needed that protection. As an adult it's time for him to handle it himself. It would be best to tell angel \"If you ever want to talk to your mom you can talk to her you're an adult now and I'll support whatever you want and but I'm not going to be go between anymore\" to her if she calls you can say \"I've given him your number and told him you want to talk to him if he wants to talk with you he'll call.\" And any time she calls for info just say \"nope sorry we're staying out of it goodbye\" for other relatives you can say \"this is between us and them so its none of your business\"\n\nI would definitely uninvite them from the wedding.

You didn't just protect Angel but you actually made it clear to your aunt that you will not be swayed nor betray Angel's trust", "Even when trying to reconnect, she said she wants to talk to her daughter, not son. Yeah no, she's not worthy of you spending any time thinking whether you might be in the wrong.\n\nAlso, you and your fiance are amazing people for being there for Angel when he needed someone!", "This is the kind of petty I\u2019m here for!", "Yesssss \ud83d\udc4f\u2728\ud83e\udd73 this OP", "Yeah, \"what daughter?\" might be a good answer....", "Honestly, I'd consider changing the venue.

Especially because the aunt still says \"I want to speak to my daughter\". Not only will they hurt Angel at your wedding but they will cause a huge drama that I'm sure you don't want either!\n\nKeep being an excellent cousin to Angel!", "I can't believe some parents actually woild do that? Shoot their own kid because of something like this?\n\nBig NTA OP, if i were you or your fiancee, i would have your cousin as best man :) just to show how much he is appreciated and loved. Good luck with your marriage and I'm so happy you guys stand up for him like this."]}
