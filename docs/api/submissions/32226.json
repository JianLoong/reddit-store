I 26F am caught between a rock and a hard place right now. To start things out, my cousin, Angel 22M came out as transgender when he was 13 and I was 17. I of course accepted him with open arms and don\u2019t think any less of him for being transgender. He said his parents weren\u2019t exactly amused and just tolerated it. When I was in college and would come to visit, they would deadname him and use his old pronouns and my other cousins would say things like \u201cAngel wants to be a boy\u201d and \u201cShe\u2019s still a girl.\u201d My aunt and uncle didn\u2019t do anything about that and I could tell it was making Angel upset. \n\n4 years ago when Angel was 18, he had a big fight with his parents after he started HRT. They didn\u2019t kick him out, but he called me to vent and said he couldn\u2019t take it anymore and couldn\u2019t wait to move out. I talked to my fianc\u00e9, and we agreed to let Angel stay with us until he can get his own place to live. \n\nWe called back and offered him the guest room, which he gladly accepted. And he stayed with us until he finished trade school, got a job and moved in with his partner. He remained low contact with his parents, but still wanted me to stay in touch. Any time he and his parents spoke, it was through me or my fianc\u00e9. \n\nFast forward 4 years, I\u2019m 26 and Angel is 22 and hasn\u2019t spoken to his parents at all in that time. My aunt reached out to me and asked to talk to Angel. He didn\u2019t want to talk, so I told her that. She wasn\u2019t having it and demanded to \u201ctalk to her daughter.\u201d I stood firm and she asked for at least Angel\u2019s phone number, which Angel didn\u2019t want so I told her no. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t backing down, and neither was I until she stopped with me and started pestering my fianc\u00e9 about it, only to get the same results. While she was on the phone with my fianc\u00e9, I took the phone and told her to stop trying to get to Angel because it wasn\u2019t happening. If she wanted to have a relationship with him, she should\u2019ve been a better mom and accepted him for who he was with a few choice words thrown in the mix. \n\nOur extended family is extremely divided, with Angel and my fianc\u00e9 firmly in my side. I\u2019m being crucified by everyone on my aunt\u2019s side for how I spoke to her and keeping her child from her. But with some of the things they\u2019re saying to me and calling me, I\u2019m now feeling a little guilty for causing this rift in the family so AITA?", "created_utc": 1701570097, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189ja5b/aita_for_not_giving_my_aunt_my_cousins_phone/", "score": 2050, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His family unflinchingly accept me, they've not been great with him. He went no contact with his mom over 3 years ago and a big sticking point was not even attempting to try to gender him or name him correctly. My mother passed around the time he went no contact and a big thing for him was the difference in how our mothers treated us. My mother was one of my biggest supporters and there was no one she loved more than her sons. My husband's mom treated him like an afterthought and continuously just didn't respect him. His family still tries to get him to break no contact because I get that its awkward for them but I doubt he ever will, there's too much damage there. You're not keeping Angel from his parents, he's a grown adult who realized that his parents love for him was conditional. You didn't cause the rift, THEY did. You told your aunt the truth, and she needed to hear it. You're very much NTA but I would absolutely uninvite aunt from the wedding. Especially since I dont doubt she won't be aggressive with Angel.

If they did, then they were somewhat sympathetic/supportive and I would say that you only added to the drama by implying that Aunt was a bad mom.

Her blatant disrespect and refusal to accept her child for who he is, that's all down to her. Keep on being the fabulous person you are. NTA", "NTA. I want to start by thanking you. Because what you did, supporting Angel, accepting him, letting him live with you, and being the go between for him with his family is much more difficult than you made it seem. It\u2019s a huge thing that many trans people don\u2019t get. Support and love from family. So thank you for that. \n\nOnto the subject of family. You are NTA and you are not keeping your aunt from her child, her actions have. Even now she deadnames and dead pronouns him. If she wanted a relationship she\u2019d adjust. Tell me why every single of one of these people who can\u2019t learn a new name and pronoun has no issue learning a married woman\u2019s new last name and switching from Ms. to Mrs. Oh that\u2019s right, because it\u2019s not hard and your aunt is making a conscious choice to alienate her son. You are not giving up information per Angel\u2019s request. End of story. Tell your family to shove it.", "You're not the asshole. You're the cousin that sooooo many people need. Thank you for being a good person. You might have saved your cousin's life by supporting them.", "NTA at all! As someone who is NB and pansexual and didn't have support from my family in the slightest, I really love and appreciate you for sticking up for Angel. At a time when he needed familial support the most, you were there for him and took him in. \n\nIf they wanted a relationship with them, they should've accepted him or at least tried to educate themselves to better support him so they could learn to accept him. I say that because my grandma didn't accept me at first, but over time she learned to and was super happy to meet my girlfriend at the time. Sounds like your aunt hasn't tried at all and thinks Angel should just deal with it because \"family\". Yeah no. You did good, and you helped Angel in a big way. Keep your head up and don't let your aunt and her side get to you. You're doing great \u2764", "You are being the best cousin ever. \u2764\ufe0f NTA", "NTA. Big. Huge NTA. He knows who he is after 10 years. His parents are bigots for not accepting it. Personally lived through this. I have no problem going NC with people who are toxic, they have no business in your lives.", "NTA he is not underage kid. He made decision to move out and he does not want to contact them for obvious reason. You are just allowing him to keep him emotional safe area ...safe. He does not want to speak with them and you do not provide the number because it is not yours to give. If he wants to speak with them he will. \n\nAlso \" He didn\u2019t want to talk, so I told her that. She wasn\u2019t having it and demanded to \u201ctalk to her daughter.\u201d\" Tells you everything...they still have not accepted him and only want to speak with them in their own terms and own pronouns. They can kick rock.  Also you rock :)", "NTA. Angel went no contact by his choice because of horrible parents. You are being the absolute best support to him. He is an adult and she has no rights anymore. Keep doing just as you are.", "W fianc\u00e9, NTA, I just wanted to also pat fianc\u00e9 on the back for being an awesome future cousin-in law", "NTA. But your aunt is and so is your family. Smells of bigotry and regrets.", "You protected your family,Angel. He didn\u2019t want to speak to his parents and you told them that. They chose to be nasty. You told them the hard truth and they cannot accept it. You\u2019re not the AH, they are.", "NTA. Fuck her. When she demanded to speak to her daughter, should\u2019ve said \u201cDaughter? I don\u2019t know her. I just know your son.\u201d", "NTA. \n\nIf it's such a big deal to your aunt, she can learn to accept that Angel is a male and stop referring to him as her daughter. You did the right thing.", "NTA in the slightest.", "Absolutely not.", "Yta give them her number", "NTA. You didn\u2019t cause this rift, your Aunt did by disrespecting your cousin\u2019s very being. She is a terrible mother & until she grows up, your cousin will continue to desire no-contact. You are a good cousin for respecting his wishes & refusing your aunt\u2019s attempts.", "Nta. Your cousin is an adult. If he wants to speak to her he will. You did the right thing, she isn't owed anything", "NTA, at the very least, it\u2019s not your information to divulge.  You are not keeping her from her son, she\u2019s done that herself.", "YOU did not cause anything\n\nKid-Beaters Stalkers Bullies Religious Political Are Garbage Oppression\n\n\n?? Start Blocking Phone Number And Social Media??\n\n\nN\nT\nA\n\n\n\nN\nT\nA\n\n\n\nPeace\n\n\n,", "NTA. Angel rocks! You, your finance, and Angel are all lucky to have each other! Haters gonna hate. If your aunt is upset, she should remember it sucks to suck!", "You. Did. Not. Cause. This. Rift. Your bigoted asshole family did. I am always so happy when I hear that marginalized youth (look, I\u2019m 59, y\u2019all are youth to me!) have other family members who cherish, support, and protect them. If your aunt keeps it up, I would consider blocking them. NTA. Keep having Angel\u2019s back.", "NTA as the parent of a transgender I will say is very hard. You basically have to go through the death of the child you raised. All pictures and memories have to be kept secret as not to out them. You then have to embrace the new person they are. It's really really hard. However if you love them you do it. You put your feelings aside and do what's best for them to have as happy a life as possible. It's what must be done to stay in their life so you either do it or get the hell.out of their way. Thank you for being there for your cousin.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t keeping anyone from anyone. You are respecting a grown adults decision not to share their contact info with someone else. Which is pretty basic respect and desency", "You did not cause this rift, it was there and always will be.  Your Aunt and Uncle have not been able to come to terms with who their child became.  It is time for Angel to man up and either in a letter or in person tell his parents in no uncertain terms to leave you and your fianc\u00e9 alone.  He needs to tell his mom who he is and if that is unacceptable to them, then this is the last communication he will have with them.", "[removed]", "Even now Angel\u2019s mother is misgendering him. That\u2019s not going to help OP to trust her. Angel wanted very LC and through someone else, it will stay that way.", "You are not the one causing a rift in your family. You are merely respecting your cousin's wishes.", "I\u2019ve been reading the other comments and I\u2019m starting to think they don\u2019t really want to just talk to Angel. They probably want money or something from him", "Just he. No need for the transphobic he/she", "Let me break down why what you said is wrong. It has nothing to do with being grown. He is setting boundaries. Next older adults are allowed to \u201cprotect\u201d whoever they want especially from people who don\u2019t give a fuck about someone else\u2019s boundaries. You don\u2019t stop having trauma because you turn 18.  Next calling a trans person anything but their name and pronouns that they so choose is abuse. Abuse isn\u2019t just physical. It\u2019s mental and emotionally as well. Which is what this is. As for Angel needing counseling if he is Is on HRT he\u2019s been in counseling probably for a lot more then just gender issues. The only A H here is Angels parents and the people not respecting him.", "seems like you're just blind to reality, actually", "How is this overly complicated? It's a story that happens time and again to LGBT folk sadly.", "You must be one of the parents. And correction: him/he/his.", "You\u2019re wrong and I will tell you why. Angel is a he, and you\u2019re getting sex and gender confused. Now OP hasn\u2019t said if Angel has gone under the blade or not, but that isn\u2019t our business anyway. He was assigned female at birth, and that\u2019s a fact. But he is still a man, which is also a fact. And well yes, Angel\u2019s parents technically are still his parents, OP is not hindering them coming back together. Angel is a grown ass man and if he wants to reconcile with his parents, he can initiate that himself", "OP isn\u2019t fighting Angel\u2019s battles for him, she\u2019s standing by his side and seeing him through his hardships, because there\u2019s absolutely no way in hell that this is easy for him. Everyone needs support every now and then, and OP is providing the support Angel needs", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I have no idea what I did to deserve that but hey, I\u2019m not complaining", "Aww, cute. Glad there's lots of good parents out there", "Then it's even more important to not let them talk to him. They just want to use him.\n\nI saw in some other replies that you're getting married? Congrats on that ^^ you and your SO sound like wonderful people.\n\nI also agree with the replies regarding the wedding where people said to uninvited the aunt, or just not invite her or the rest of her family at all. On your wedding day you should have people who love and support you. Not a three-ring circus of flying monkeys harassing you and your cousin. I'm also in favour of getting security at the wedding, just in case. Because if the aunt knows/suspects that \"her daughter\" will be there, or anyone else in her family knows/realises, then someone will likely show up and cause a scene. So security staff who knows what those bigots look like could get you peace of mind on the big day.", "Your aunt misgendering Angel shows she still hasn\u2019t come to terms with his gender identity. If your gut feeling is that there\u2019s an ulterior motive then listen to your gut and keep this NC.", "Because they disagree they are bigoted? If that is the definition, then anyone who adheres to a position can be ascribed that label; however,  at the moment you feel comfortable saying such things because you can appeal ad populum for support, but that doesn't make it correct.", "Nah, I guarantee the birth certificate says female, and that denotes female pronouns. Those pronouns, if you did not know, are **she/her/hers** in English. You're welcome for the correction.", "Congratulations! Hope everything goes well at your wedding :)", "Oh hell yes. They do not deserve to attend and you need to protect Angel.", "Oh absolutely, I wasnt saying that being old is an excuse to be transphobic or anything. But like, my uncle grew up with the whole heteronormative being forced on his head, and during the time with no internet he never actually saw a gay couple. So yeah it made him feel weird and unconfortable the first time he saw two man sharing a kiss in public. But the thing is, he was never rude to gay people, but it still took some time for him to get used to it.\n\nThe same happened to my sibling's friend who came out as trans when she was 16. Her patents were not rude, or agressive, but they also were not supportive at first because they had a hard time understanding this. Yes they knew trans people existed, but they also had many misconceptions about it and didnt understand how their child could be one.\n\nThey are supportive today, but it took a while for them to get there, they used the deadname sometimes out of habit, but their daughter was very understanding and patience. Today they are supportive and proud and will correct other people when they use their daughters deadname and wrong pronoums", "Love this!", "If awards were still a thing I\u2019d give one to you.", "He probably changed that certificate already, so that's another one of your arguments been wrong. \n\nHe's been a male he's whole life, out for almost a decade and an adult now, he's the one making the decision to not talk to his parents who are not willing to understand him for who he is, OP is just respecting that decision.", "That's not up to you, nor his parents to decide. If he decided to go by he/him/whatever, then you go by that if you respect wlhim without any buts of contradiction. \n\nAnd don't lecture me about the English language. You didn't correct anything. You should correct how you treat people, especially people that live true to their ownselves.", "So in other words, you don't actually believe in 'constructive dialogue' or whatever shit you're trying to advocate here. You just want the parents to have a chance to browbeat their ***son*** because for some reason you think people should be forced to be around those who don't respect them and abuse them.\n\nKindly, with all due respect, get fucked. The parents broke their family, they can sleep in the bed they made.", "Thanksss!!", "Yeah, that makes sense. I was totally confused the first time I stumbled over the use of they/ them pronouns. If you don't know, you don't know.\n\nI think most of us have some learning to do when someone in our family or surroundings come out as trans. What I generally experience is that as long as people actually do their best and will listen and respect even if they find it strange and unfamiliar, that really goes a long way.", "The argument is not likely gone. Not every state allows birth certificate alteration.\n\nThe parents will not see that she has been male her whole life. I will put the whole biological argument aside for the moment. It can be incredibly hard because they will see her as their little girl. Their hearts are hung on her having children and them becoming grandparents. This is excluding any religious beliefs they have which further complicates things. \nThe parents have beliefs and identities too. It is amazingly complex, but nothing will happen until they communicate.\nThe mother after 4 years has opened the door. They cannot even meet half way if they don't talk.", "Living falsity isn't true. It would be disrespectful to allow someone to live a lie and feed the echo chamber. It's disrespectful to alter the English language and expect people to conform to your derangement.", "Right... Notice I am not the one using pejoratives and ad hominems when they hear something they don't like. \nConstructive dialogue doesn't mean abandoning one's position, but understanding the opposing viewpoint. I do understand both viewpoints, but put forward what would be the opposite contention. There's actually no need for people to get upset. It is a discussion.", "Yeah, if you want the wedding to go smoothly, they can't meet. Sounds like you'll get backlash but like... If she is still calling her son \"my daughter\" after all those years it's going to be a trainwreck that you don't need to be handling. If you want to be the most courteous possible, send her some reading material on transgenders and call it a day. Invitations to those kinds of events are earned, not owed.", "Some security people at the wedding would be a good idea because there's a chance they may try to go there even if they get uninvited.", "Op this - please stop acknowledging the misgendering and deadnaming. If your aunt called screaming about \u201cmy lizard!\u201d you\u2019d be like \u201cwtf are you talking about, I don\u2019t know anything about your lizard, you don\u2019t have a lizard/all your lizards are accounted for.\u201d Take the same approach here: she doesn\u2019t have a daughter, if she calls looking for her daughter, she\u2019s not making any sense and does she need psychiatric help?", "She hasn't opened anything, she's still disrespecting her son, there is no opening for any communication here and that's pretty clear.\n\nAnd also, if your whole thing is respecting the mothers wishes, what about Angel? He's likely still hurt, he has been disrespected his whole life and that's pretty difficult, he likely still needs time to heal, and that's his choice and his choice only. Once again, OP is just respecting that he just doesn't want to talk to his mother.", "Okay then, let's put the whole trans thing out of the equation.\n\nThe child gets to decide who they let into their life. If they don't want their parents in there, especially because of the shitty things they did to him, then trying to push the issue, when being in his life isn't a right they have to begin with, is the asshole move.\n\nChildren get estranged from their parents for a myriad of reasons. To advocate that a person *has* to interact with people they want nothing to do with, especially when the offending party show no sign of being apologetic or contrite, is, frankly, a shitty thing to do.  \n\n\nWhat do you think that would accomplish, exactly? The shitty treatment is clearly going to continue given how the aunt is acting, so why do you think the cousin should be subjected to that against his wishes? He doesn't want to argue his identity, he just wants to live. Despite a depressingly popular belief, family doesn't actually *own* you as a person. He doesn't owe his mum anything. In fact, I'd say he's respecting *their* beliefs by not trying to insist they seem him as their son and simply removing himself from the situation. Win-win for everybody, the son gets to be a man and the parents don't need to deal with having a trans child. So what, exactly, would forcing them together accomplish?", "Has your cousin been saddled with his bigot father's name on top of everything else? \n\nPoor kid... Well, poor adult now.", "Yeah that\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do. Angel\u2019s partner is one tough cookie and they\u2019re in the bridal party so if my aunt were to get past security and try something there, then she\u2019ll have to deal with them too", "This is spicy and i like it", "Except it IS technically gaslighting to pretend to not know what she's talking about when what she's talking about is factually incorrecr but you DO know what it's about. \"He's not your daughter\" is the appropriate wording, Just Like telling a Stalker \"She's Not your wife\" when it's about their ex-wife or \"He's Not your best friend\" when it's about an ex-friendly acquaintance who never reciprocated bestfriend Feelings, are more productive that \"you never Had a wife\" or \"you don't have a best friend\".", "Yes. Yes he is and as far as I'm aware he doesn't go by any nicknames either. He's basically NC with the entire family so I'm not sure where he's at or how he's doing, but I look him up once in awhile and hope he's doing OK for himself."]}
