I 26F am caught between a rock and a hard place right now. To start things out, my cousin, Angel 22M came out as transgender when he was 13 and I was 17. I of course accepted him with open arms and don\u2019t think any less of him for being transgender. He said his parents weren\u2019t exactly amused and just tolerated it. When I was in college and would come to visit, they would deadname him and use his old pronouns and my other cousins would say things like \u201cAngel wants to be a boy\u201d and \u201cShe\u2019s still a girl.\u201d My aunt and uncle didn\u2019t do anything about that and I could tell it was making Angel upset. \n\n4 years ago when Angel was 18, he had a big fight with his parents after he started HRT. They didn\u2019t kick him out, but he called me to vent and said he couldn\u2019t take it anymore and couldn\u2019t wait to move out. I talked to my fianc\u00e9, and we agreed to let Angel stay with us until he can get his own place to live. \n\nWe called back and offered him the guest room, which he gladly accepted. And he stayed with us until he finished trade school, got a job and moved in with his partner. He remained low contact with his parents, but still wanted me to stay in touch. Any time he and his parents spoke, it was through me or my fianc\u00e9. \n\nFast forward 4 years, I\u2019m 26 and Angel is 22 and hasn\u2019t spoken to his parents at all in that time. My aunt reached out to me and asked to talk to Angel. He didn\u2019t want to talk, so I told her that. She wasn\u2019t having it and demanded to \u201ctalk to her daughter.\u201d I stood firm and she asked for at least Angel\u2019s phone number, which Angel didn\u2019t want so I told her no. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t backing down, and neither was I until she stopped with me and started pestering my fianc\u00e9 about it, only to get the same results. While she was on the phone with my fianc\u00e9, I took the phone and told her to stop trying to get to Angel because it wasn\u2019t happening. If she wanted to have a relationship with him, she should\u2019ve been a better mom and accepted him for who he was with a few choice words thrown in the mix. \n\nOur extended family is extremely divided, with Angel and my fianc\u00e9 firmly in my side. I\u2019m being crucified by everyone on my aunt\u2019s side for how I spoke to her and keeping her child from her. But with some of the things they\u2019re saying to me and calling me, I\u2019m now feeling a little guilty for causing this rift in the family so AITA?", "created_utc": 1701570097, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189ja5b/aita_for_not_giving_my_aunt_my_cousins_phone/", "score": 453, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His family unflinchingly accept me, they've not been great with him. He went no contact with his mom over 3 years ago and a big sticking point was not even attempting to try to gender him or name him correctly. My mother passed around the time he went no contact and a big thing for him was the difference in how our mothers treated us. My mother was one of my biggest supporters and there was no one she loved more than her sons. My husband's mom treated him like an afterthought and continuously just didn't respect him. His family still tries to get him to break no contact because I get that its awkward for them but I doubt he ever will, there's too much damage there. You're not keeping Angel from his parents, he's a grown adult who realized that his parents love for him was conditional. You didn't cause the rift, THEY did. You told your aunt the truth, and she needed to hear it. You're very much NTA but I would absolutely uninvite aunt from the wedding. Especially since I dont doubt she won't be aggressive with Angel.

If they did, then they were somewhat sympathetic/supportive and I would say that you only added to the drama by implying that Aunt was a bad mom.

You're doing the right thing.", "NTA\n\n\nHard and fast rule: Never give out anyone's phone number to anyone without first getting their okay. Never.\n\nGive someone's number to 'phobic parents who made life so miserable they moved out as soon as possible and has avoided direct communication with the parents since? Hell to the *NO!* \n\nNext time someone accuses you of \"keeping her child from her,\" laugh at them and point out that Angel is an adult and you don't control him.\n\nLet them crucify you. Do you really care what the 'phobes think?\n\nYou're a good person, helping the world be a better place. I'm glad Angel has you in his corner.", "You didn't cause a rift. Your transphobic aunt caused a rift. \n\nLet it go. Feel free to go NC with her, as Angel has wisely done.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nYou're doing an amazing job. Angel is lucky to have a cousin like you.

You did everything right for Angel. His birthing adult is mad that abusing a kid didn\u2019t end with stockholm syndrome. As a trans guy myself, if I had someone like you in my life, I\u2019d be over the moon", "NTA\n\nAngel is an adult and gets to decide who he wants in his life.

BUT! I will pass on your message and your number. I can also pass over a letter if you\u2019d like.\u201d  \n\n\nAnd never leave your phone unlocked somewhere they can get the number from.

Also, expecting OP to be the person in the middle and facilitate access is not only wrong but would damage their relationship with their cousin, who has been through enough.

From what you said I would not be surprised if she and others from her side of the family cause a scene and harass Angel and his partner during the wedding.\n\nSeh is not willing to even try to change and use Angel's correct pronoums.

Horrible to his 3 kids, let his 2nd/3rd/ whatever wife mistreat them regularly (ex throwing away their mementos or if their rooms whole they were on so, , called his own daughter a bitch to her face at a family gathering. And I made the decision (not a hard decision on all honesty) to simply not invite him to my wedding for the primary reason that I DID want his kids to feel safe and attend. Bless his older sons heart, a month-ish befor the wedding he reached out to me directly to ask if his dad had rsvp'd yes and I was like \"baby, your dad's not invited!\"\n\nThat was nearly nine years ago, my cousin was able to come to my wedding w his partner at the time and have a lovely day and this is still one of my prouder moments in life.
