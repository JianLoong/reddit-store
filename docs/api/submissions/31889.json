The weather wasn\u2019t the best so I didn\u2019t end up at the beach but sat by the pool did some work and journaling. I enjoyed margarita\u2019s by the pool and wine at dinner. I don\u2019t know how I was able to drink all day and get everything done by 4pm. Dinner was late, we didn\u2019t end up eating until 6pm so the people who worked that night just took to go plates, and couldn\u2019t eat with us.\n\nMy mom called a few times from the kitchen asking how to turn on the oven, make a pre-made ham and turkey. My aunt asked for the recipes that I previously emailed and asked if I could come over and supervise. I ignored the calls and texts.  I did end up carving 2/3 turkeys ate and helped clean up and went back to bed. \n\nMy moms friend ended up bringing herself and 6 other people, empty handed. The creepy family friend did the usual show up empty handed, eat, grab to-go plates and leave. My cousins were bummed they didn\u2019t get left overs for finals, they were also shocked to see that their favorites weren\u2019t made and it didn\u2019t taste the same. No one took leftovers home besides my mom\u2019s friends, they cleaned us out. \n\nI think they finally realized how much goes into it because my aunt complained that she had to go to multiple stores even though she was making 1/3 of the food. My mom ordered from the fresh market and that was \u2018too much\u2019. \n\nThanksgiving day my husband and I spoke and had a great conversation about moving forward with the separation what it\u2019s going to look like for us financially and a rough timeline of when we should be legally divorced. \n\nSaturday morning I get a call from my husband\u2019s local hospital saying that he was got injured while running (he had a stress fracture that resulted in a complete break in multiple places and needed surgery). Since I\u2019m legally still his wife and he has not updated his emergency contact I flew up and I am currently at his bedside hoping I can get his family out here to take over. He didn\u2019t expect to wake up with me being there but was happy and thinks we should try counseling. \n\nAll in all I\u2019m emotionally drained. Working from his bedside. I should be able to take him back to our house tomorrow and get him set with his family and friends to take over. It\u2019s been nice being in a cold city and seeing him after so long but I\u2019m sure this marriage is over. \n\nThanks for all the advice. My therapist actually told me I have to start putting my self first and this was a good first step\n\n[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/1oZqUPFmVf)\n", "created_utc": 1701147122, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/185nybc/update_aita_for_not_cooking_thanksgiving_dinner/", "score": 2591, "replies": ["#[Original Post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17wurfs/aita_for_not_cooking_thanksgiving_dinner_and/)", "I'm so glad you didn't end up cooking.

Well done. \n\nIt might not feel perfect yet, but you're getting there.", "I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s good for everyone to decide not to cook every other or every third year.

I didnt know you had so much other things going on in your life. I was just so proud of you for dropping the rope for this years Thanksgiving.  It is the only way that people learn.\n\nI hope you continue to stand up for yourself - while being there for others. It is a balancing game not a sacrifice yourself operation.", "I applaud you for going to your husband while he was in the hospital. In a separation it\u2019s easy to be angry but you put that aside to be there for him when he hurt. I think that says a lot about your character.

If you're anywhere near Tampa the Metropolitan Ministries does a big Thanksgiving dinner for homeless or low income families. I believe they also do something at Xmas time and need help then.\n\nIf you're going to be alone at Xmas consider checking now on where in your area you can volunteer. You get to be around people that need help and don't have to put up with your stbxh and his BS.", "Only you know your family, but what about next year dividing up the labor and requiring people to pitch in and help, now that they know how much work goes into it? I love to cook, too, and I couldn\u2019t imagine going to a big feast like this and letting one person do everything. I can\u2019t imagine 20 people sitting on their asses in the living room while you rush around to do everything. \n\nI\u2019m actually the kind of person who hates that women are expected to work in the kitchen on holidays while the men sit in front of the tv watching the game, but I would never just leave it all to someone to do it solo. As it is, just preparing for my family of four, logistically I need my husband\u2019s help to get it all on the table at the same time.  I assign the kids stuff to do, too. \n\nIt sounds like you love hosting thanksgiving dinner, you just need a hand and for people to appreciate it. Don\u2019t give up that activity if you love it!

You definitely needed a break, and they definitely needed to learn to appreciate all your hard work!\n\nI think you should go back and read your posts about your husband and your break up, they will remind you why are you broke up and why you shouldn\u2019t get back together. \n\nThings are going to be on the up now, you\u2019ve escaped and you\u2019re learning to look after yourself. You are bright, physically active, educated and are clearly an excellent cook. This is a great foundation for a great life: the best is yet to come.", "Good for you for staying strong and not making Thanksgiving dinner. Bad for you for dropping everything and running to the side of your ex-husband to be his caretaker for no reason whatsoever except for the delusion that he would drop everything and go to you as well.", "I don't know why you're separating from your husband, but if it's not too bad a reason, I am hoping you can get counseling and stay together.", "This sounds beyond fake. Did everyone stand up and clap for you after?", "Yta. Usual entitled yank 1st world nonsense.", "Congratulations.\n\nOn setting boundaries for those STAYING in your life and coming to a resolution on where your relationship has gone.  \n\n\nI hope your future had very pleasant surprises awaiting you(and even more planned pleasant events).", "You should be proud of yourself.

If anyone complains, tell them they just volunteered to do the cooking.", "I couldn't imagine what you've gone through!", "I was wondering how things turned out.", "That part made me laugh. Supervise would turn to \"could you just stir that pot\" to \"could you just add some seasoning\" to \"since you're already here, could you just make this dish\"", "My friend is from the Caribbean and she says that\u2019s normal for randos to show up to eat and take food home. Happened at her wedding too.", "It's polite in my culture to send guest home with food/gifts. Even for a casual visit I've sent people home with something as little as a few plantain or a few pieces of fruit. We make so much because it is common for people to stop by unannounced for holidays. \n\nMy creepy uncle has brought tubber ware or asked for left overs at formal events. He's a physician and I've seen him do it at fundraisers I've attended for work.", "Yeah, but that still my husband. I personally felt like I had a moral obligation to be there until we could get his family state side. He needed surgery and I know how much medical situations freak him. Plus this also saved me the cost of shipping some of the items I still have here.", "Technically its her house. It's just that I cook since the last edible thing she made was breastmilk.", "I did that when I was younger, not the best experience in my book. I also think leaving volunteer experiences for people who need the for resumes is better than feeding my own need to enjoy cooking.", "I'm the opposite, I loved doing everything alone. One year I had surgery right before the holidays, I had to show a 30 year old how to grate cheese. I have a set schedule and having other people help got in my way. \n\nI genuinely HATE having people in the kitchen with me on a normal day when I can take my time cooking, but on a holiday where I have a billion and 10 things to do I'm hyper focused and do not under any circumstances want anyone over my shoulder or \"helping\".", "He is not a bad man, he is just not the right partner for me. I hope one day we can be friends but until the judge signs off I'm still his wife and in instances like this, I will show up if wanted.", "He has done so recently as well. I was hospitalized for dehydration a few weeks ago when things were contentious and missed mediation because of it. He left a work trip to be by my side, even though it was minor. \n\nWe don't hate each other we just don't work as a couple.", "85% of the stories on this sub are fake, why are you complaining? Everyone knows this is mainly a creative story writing sub these days.   It's like going into a sushi place and complaining that there's' fish.\n\nAt least this one sounds like it could actually be real, unlike most others.", "Can I just make a suggestion- if you enjoy the cooking, but not the pressure or ungrateful guests, maybe you could find a nice way of celebrating the holiday for YOU. Maybe cook a little feast for YOU, or you and  a couple of friends, or a neighbor, or your cat, whoever. But please don\u2019t put off something you enjoy until you \u201chave a husband and kids\u201d as if YOU aren\u2019t already worth the effort. Just my 2 cents.\n\nBut I\u2019m glad you held your boundaries with your family! Good job!!!", "Nail lady sounds like a best friend \ud83e\udd23", "Your nail lady sounds like my hairdresser. These are the people we need to keep us level in life!", "I think you going there for the medical emergency was fine - it showed you taking the high road, that you are a good responsible person, you didn\u2019t leave him out to dry (so to speak) and it solidified for you that it\u2019s over and you\u2019re ready to move on. You looked the the better person and cemented in how much they rely on you.", "Sorry, if you thought I was pushing it. Didn't mean to. I just got excited as I have never interacted with anyone from that part of the world. Again, sorry.", "Valid point. It's not for me either but I do know a few that get some satisfaction from doing it so I made the suggestion.   \n\nI'm also not a beach person even though I grew up in FL usually less than 15 miles from the gulf. I had my skin cancer scare many years ago in my late 20's but that was due to my time in a baseball field not the beach.", "This, I have been out of a 27 year relationship for 5 years now and I video call my mother and we cook together, squabbling in a nice way over recipes (I've changed some of the family classics) and then we eat together.  My small feast, and talks with her still keeps the passion for cooking there, just on a smaller scale.  We all are worth the effort.  We just forget it because of baggage.", "I used to be a SAHW and cooked elaborate meals everyday. \n\nI make meals I enjoy because thats how i unwind after a long day. The past few months it has been a bit harder to find motivation to cook because I've lost my appetite due to what's going on.", "THIS OP! You are definitely worth it and you'll enjoy it! At least, this has been my experience making traditional meals from scratch just for my little old lonesome! Good luck moving forward, you seem 100% on track!", "Cheaper, too.", "Bartenders. I've spent more than half my life being an unpaid therapist.", "My hairdresser is one of my best friends so it\u2019s a bonus!", "I love seeing someone stand up for their boundaries!!!  Good for you. I wish you lots of support and peace during this next phase of your life.", "OP I don't have any advice to offer but I would like to offer an online big hug from me to you. I give the best hugs and you sound like you need such a good one", "Very very happy you stuck to not making dinner! And I am glad you enjoyed yourself despite everything. Hopefully now that your family understands how stressful dinner can be, they'll re-evaluate. (Especially with your mom's friend bring 6 extra people who didn't bother to provide anything that annoys me so much lol). Or they won't. But as my favorite saying goes: not your circus, not your monkeys. I really hope counseling works with you and your husband! A random college student is rooting for you!", "Good for you.\n\nStill NTA", "Your nail lady is harsh but fair.\n\nBecause it seems it gave your husband false hope by turning up when you should have contacted his family members.\n\nLike, yes, he might do it for you... because he still has a glimmer of hope for your relationship, and it sounds very much like you do not want to be with him any more. You don't want him to learn he can pull out 'emergencies' and you'll appear instantly.", "And I LOVE how unbothered you were by them taking the leftovers and how you didn't let the college kids being sad about the lack of food for finals get to you since it *isn't. YOUR. ***PROBLEM***!*!", "Been there. Rushed marriage and everything. It's incredibly hard when you look in the mirror and find yourself unrecognizable and doing things out of sorts and having no good communication with the other person.

We both respect that and will honor that.", "It\u2019s a cultural thing. I do feel bad for the college kids.

I also always do homemade protein bars because of allergies.", "My mom grew up \u2018privileged\u2019 she always had a cook so she never learned how to.

It\u2019s so good.", "And aestheticians. I\u2019ve told mine she should charge more when I dump on her.", "And that's the thing though, you can empathize *and* enlist them to make future thanksgivings better for y'all. Remind them in 10 months that you didn't cook this year and they may be willing to throw in some money or effort (ex. Grocery run while you do your kitchen thing) to get a plate to go and also run interference on the most disrespectful guests.", "Agree, I've learned that now. Back in the mid-70's when I was spending large amounts of time on  baseball fields and sweating heavily we didn't have waterproof sunscreen. The time I tried to use the sunscreen we did have I ended up getting it in my eyes trying to dry off sweat on my head. Believe me, sunscreen and contacts don't work too well together.\n\nI realize this is way off topic, but as a 50 plus year resident of Florida one of the funniest tourist fails is seeing some guy that has bald spots not realizing he needs sunscreen on his head.", "I try to do that for Easter", "One of my male suitors grew up in the north east, he planned a late afternoon picnic in Florida winter on the beach and asked why I was putting it on as I was getting ready.
