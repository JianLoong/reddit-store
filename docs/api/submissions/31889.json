The weather wasn\u2019t the best so I didn\u2019t end up at the beach but sat by the pool did some work and journaling. I enjoyed margarita\u2019s by the pool and wine at dinner. I don\u2019t know how I was able to drink all day and get everything done by 4pm. Dinner was late, we didn\u2019t end up eating until 6pm so the people who worked that night just took to go plates, and couldn\u2019t eat with us.\n\nMy mom called a few times from the kitchen asking how to turn on the oven, make a pre-made ham and turkey. My aunt asked for the recipes that I previously emailed and asked if I could come over and supervise. I ignored the calls and texts.  I did end up carving 2/3 turkeys ate and helped clean up and went back to bed. \n\nMy moms friend ended up bringing herself and 6 other people, empty handed. The creepy family friend did the usual show up empty handed, eat, grab to-go plates and leave. My cousins were bummed they didn\u2019t get left overs for finals, they were also shocked to see that their favorites weren\u2019t made and it didn\u2019t taste the same. No one took leftovers home besides my mom\u2019s friends, they cleaned us out. \n\nI think they finally realized how much goes into it because my aunt complained that she had to go to multiple stores even though she was making 1/3 of the food. My mom ordered from the fresh market and that was \u2018too much\u2019. \n\nThanksgiving day my husband and I spoke and had a great conversation about moving forward with the separation what it\u2019s going to look like for us financially and a rough timeline of when we should be legally divorced. \n\nSaturday morning I get a call from my husband\u2019s local hospital saying that he was got injured while running (he had a stress fracture that resulted in a complete break in multiple places and needed surgery). Since I\u2019m legally still his wife and he has not updated his emergency contact I flew up and I am currently at his bedside hoping I can get his family out here to take over. He didn\u2019t expect to wake up with me being there but was happy and thinks we should try counseling. \n\nAll in all I\u2019m emotionally drained. Working from his bedside. I should be able to take him back to our house tomorrow and get him set with his family and friends to take over. It\u2019s been nice being in a cold city and seeing him after so long but I\u2019m sure this marriage is over. \n\nThanks for all the advice. My therapist actually told me I have to start putting my self first and this was a good first step\n\n[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/1oZqUPFmVf)\n", "created_utc": 1701147122, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/185nybc/update_aita_for_not_cooking_thanksgiving_dinner/", "score": 41, "replies": ["#[Original Post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17wurfs/aita_for_not_cooking_thanksgiving_dinner_and/)", "I'm so glad you didn't end up cooking. I hope that after your separation is less fresh that you can love the holiday again, even if you never, ever, cook another full Thanksgiving meal.", "I was really hoping for a happier ending, but I hope that you do start doing more for yourself and maybe try counseling for yourself to help you get through and on to the next stage.", "I'm glad everything worked out!  Thank you for the update.\n\nI very much enjoy cooking Thanksgiving dinner, but this year it was only my wife, her parents and my parents (plus our two kids), so it was a relaxing, enjoyable time. I couldn't imagine what you've gone through!\n\nBest wishes to you!", "I'm so proud of you. I read your first post and was really hoping you got a giant break from the demands that your family had on you.\n\nHoping this year was breaking patterns- a new start and that you get what you need going forward. Including a peaceful end to your marriage. Thank you for updating.", "Oh I\u2019m going to go back to cooking the whole thing when I\u2019m married and have my kids. It\u2019ll be just my little family.", "My called my therapist when I landed and she literally said \u2018we just talked about this\u2019 \u2018why did you drop everything\u2019 and I said I\u2019m still his wife and he\u2019d do it for me (which is true). My nail lady called me a dumb bitch and asked to pick up something from a store here we don\u2019t have back home.", "Sounds like perfection!", "Honestly I think I frequently get better (more direct, lol) therapy from my nail lady than my actual therapist, too."]}
