Other than her I have 2 more kids: daughter, 19 and son, 11. \n\nMy eldest is currently pregnant and was recently speaking about wanting to buy a bigger apartment, because they now live in a 1 bedroom apartment that her husband has had a while before they got married.\n\nThey also share a business together as their main source of income (they don\u2019t have other jobs) and the nature of that business is seasonal, so there are times when they could get a lot of money and the other times it would be stalled. \n\nHer parents-in-law are pretty well off, not rich but definitely above average. And they are older than me and my husband (both in their 60s) so apart from this son they only have one other daughter who is also in her late twenties and is married into a very rich family. In short - my daughter\u2019s family in law is better off financially than us by a lot and the parents don\u2019t really have any dependents. \n\nMy daughter and her husband borrowed money from their rich relatives to open their business with promises to give it back within 2-3 years. And I\u2019m speaking a big sum of money, about a 100k. You would think that with a big debt like that they should be more frugal with their finances, but they make a lot of uneconomic decisions. They buy designer clothes for their toddler, eat out/order food practically every day, buy latest phones and go on vacations to very expensive hotels. \n\nMe and my husband still have to support our two younger kids, as my daughter is now in college (so definitely a couple more years of financial support) and my son is in middle school so he fully depends on us. We are not by any means poor, we have significant money in savings but that we set aside for our two kids\u2019 education and retirement. FYI we put our eldest daughter through college as well so no one is getting special treatment.\n\nI would not call myself frugal, but we don\u2019t spend a lot of money on clothes, barely ever eat out, have all IKEA furniture and replace our electronics at least after 4-5 years. We only really splurge on going on a vacation 1-2 times a year and it\u2019s never very fancy hotels either. I\u2019ve always been conscious about money so that let me set aside good savings.\n\nNow my eldest secretly told my dad that she\u2019s planning to ask me for the money for the apartment, not to borrow but as my gift for her, since her husband\u2019s family already helped them with the business so they don\u2019t want to bother them more.\n\nI genuinely don\u2019t want to give her that money because I still have two dependents and want to have some left for myself for a safe retirement. Her spendings do not align with her financial goals and I don\u2019t want her to think that she can have a lavish lifestyle which even I cannot afford and then ask me for 100+k as a gift.\n\nWIBTA?", "created_utc": 1693691434, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168eybm/wibta_for_not_giving_my_daughter_money_to_buy_an/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
