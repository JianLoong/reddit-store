She brings the food upstairs, takes my son in the guest room with her, closes the door and they eat. \nI go downstairs shortly afterwards thinking there is some bacon and eggs left over. I get down there and\u2026.nothing. She didn\u2019t even make an extra slice of bacon for me. \nMind you, It\u2019s my house, my groceries, yada yada yada. I\u2019m the only one working to keep us afloat due to his injury so it\u2019s already a lot on my shoulders (which is possibly why this felt like a bigger deal than it actually was) But the part that pissed me off was that she cooked and didn\u2019t make enough for me or ask me if I wanted any. I find that extremely rude. I was raised that if you cook, you make enough for everyone unless they say otherwise. \nThat night I go to the hospital and I tell my husband. I told him that I would address it, but wanted to give him a heads up. He tells her anyway and the next morning she does the same thing. Only this time she\u2019s left me ONE piece of bacon on the stove. Nothing else. \nI felt she was trying to be funny, but I was raised to respect my elders so I didn\u2019t snap.

Am I not worth the \u201cHey, I\u2019m making breakfast, you want something?\u201d\u201d So I told her that in this house, if we cook, we make enough for everyone. She told my husband I was being disrespectful and that she came to do us a favor so I should be grateful. \nI mean, thanks for helping me with my son, but that doesn\u2019t give you an excuse to treat me like I\u2019m not here in my own house. \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1685763128, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13yzec6/aita_for_expecting_my_mil_to_make_enough_food_for/", "score": 213, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is such bizarre behaviour that it can\u2019t be anything other than an intentional slight. \n\nI get that she\u2019s there to help with childcare and not to be your full-service housekeeper, but if she\u2019s cooking your groceries for herself and your child, she should absolutely be asking if you want some too.", "First red flag for me:  I don't know of anyone that would take a child into their private room, shut the door and feed them there---and not in the kitchen. In my house, there's a rule you don't eat in bedrooms. Sometimes the living room, but the kitchen is preferred. And what was the purpose of isolating herself and your son in a closed bedroom to eat? Or isolating them in an enclosed room at all? \n\nOnce, I get. Maybe at one point, she saw you not eat breakfast, and she wrongly assumed you wouldn't want anything. All I can think is, she's mad you didn't address it with her, and her son told her. That could be the cause of the 1-piece of bacon (in her eyes, talking about her behind her back instead of confronting her directly). Okay, I'm giving her that one. I can be petty myself on occasion. Until you went on. \n\nThen, you confronted her directly and said you found it disrespectful. She turns around and tells your husband (NOT YOU) that YOU were being disrespectful. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. \n\nBottom line, this woman does not like you. She also isolates herself with your child for some odd reason. HUGE RED FLAG. Anytime someone isolates themselves from another person, I immediately question their intentions. What are they saying or doing that they need a closed door? I'm not talking about normal privacy but deliberate isolation from the household/ person when it's not necessary. Eating is something you do in the main house, or kitchen---not your bedroom with the door closed. Especially with a toddler who tends to be very messy. \n\nYou/anyone doing me a favor does not give them permission to be an asshole toward me. Yes, I'm grateful for your action in assisting me, but that doesn't mean you get to abuse me because you helped me. Now she's also manipulative. \n\nI'd tell her thank you for your time and assistance, but we have it from here. Good bye. Pack her bags and escort her to the airport. You might have to visit your husband less, or enlist the help of friends or a neighbor you trust, or hire a sitter. But you're going to be better off without this woman in your home saying God knows what to your son about you--behind closed doors. Or worse. Call me paranoid, and I am. But just because I'm paranoid doesn't mean I'm wrong. \n\nNTA", "Just\u2026.dang.\n\nI was sorta okay with her just being absent minded, but the one piece of bacon\u2026. Not gonna lie, I\u2019d have had trouble holding my tongue at that point! And I also was raised to respect my elders, but just dang!\n\nNTA\u2026 like doubly so.", "Let me add a few more things for context and a timeline: \n\nMy husband was in the hospital for a week. She arrived the afternoon before surgery. He picked her up from the airport with my son (airport runs usually aren\u2019t a family trip) so i stayed behind. Usually we go out to eat when she gets in. This time they went out to eat at a restaurant on their way home and didn\u2019t bring me anything or ask if i wanted to join them. My husband felt terrible that he forgot to ask me about food, but i told him I\u2019d just Uber. The next morning was surgery day and I wasn\u2019t home and expected nothing. 2nd morning is the day in the room with son. I tt my husband that afternoon. . On my way home, after speaking with my husband, she called him and asked if she can use my car to go visit him. When I got home, she asked where the key was. Me being confused asked her what was going on and she said my husband told her she could use my car. I gave her the keys, she left to visit. She could\u2019ve asked me herself. Anyway, this must have been when he told her what i said during her visit with him. She came home later that night with food only for herself and ate it downstairs. The tv was loud and my son was sleeping. I grabbed my son and brought him in the room with me so she wouldn\u2019t wake him. I was too tired to confront her and told myself i would address it in the am.  Which brings us to the 3rd morning. This is when she left the piece of bacon. Shortly after, she left for the airport. Honestly, i wasn\u2019t expecting her to cook and when she did i was expecting the same thing she did the day before. I was going to drop it, because confrontation sucks and she was leaving anyway. When she left the 1 piece of bacon, i felt like it was a middle finger to me which is why I addressed it. \nMy husband should\u2019ve let me handle it. But out of respect, i wanted to give him a heads up. Truthfully her actions pissed him off more than I would\u2019ve expected and I\u2019m assuming that this is why he said something to her.\n\nYes I felt slighted and disrespected in my house. And again, I may be feeling really sensitive with all the stress going on. However, I have always been really nice and accommodating to her. Always. Sometimes she just acts like I pissed in her cheerios towards me.", "NTA. Your MIL not making you breakfast while cooking for herself and your son is super petty and passive-aggressive. When she left you one piece the next day, that was malicious compliance. \"Technically, I made you something.\" BS. \n\nThat old idea of \"don't do me any favors\" comes to mind. I hate when people \"help you\" so that they can hold it over your head, mistreat you later, or resent you for it.", "NTA. \n\nDay 1: isn't her fault- she assumes you've eaten. She's in charge of feeding your son. No blame, just lack of communication. \n\nDay 2: WTF is wrong with this spiteful cow? We don't sneer at people who need our help. We don't feed toddlers in a bedroom. And we certainly don't leave a single slice of bacon in a passive aggressive AH move. \n\nCausing you stress isn't helping. It's time for her to go.", "NTA. It is very rude to just feed yourself in someone else's house with their own food while you are just sitting there being hungry.\n\nShe really doesn't like you.", "NTA, order a pizza for you and your son.", "MIL sounds pretty vindictive. NTA.", "NTA- I find her behavior disrespectful. This is your house, food, utilities, appliances, etc. she should at least ask if you would like whatever it is she is cooking. The fact she left you ONE piece of bacon is definitely being funny and assholery. That\u2019s a slap in the face. First you weren\u2019t good enough for a meal, now you\u2019re getting scrap like a dog. No ma\u2019am I don\u2019t think so. She should be grateful she is even allowed to make herself meals at all with your groceries instead of buying her own. Me being me, I would\u2019ve went to wherever she was , and took food off her plate and ate it right there in her face. Or asked your son if you could try a piece since grandma forgot to make more food for mommy. Hopefully she will be gone soon. I\u2019m sorry you feel like a ghost in your own home!", "That was pretty rude of her. NTA. Since it is your food she should have at least asked and considered you. I don't necessarily thing the same as you, but she was a guest and didn't bring her own food so bad on her. And the way she did it...wow. It's kind of a slap in the face. \n\nIf I were visiting someone I would never touch the food unless offered and even then I'm like let me help with something, i'll buy some groceries for everyone...etc.", "NTA She\u2019s doing this intentionally and I\u2019d tell her she is not allowed to shut your son in the guest room with her, because that\u2019s really weird. Even if she\u2019s just doing that to rub in the fact that she\u2019s excluding you from meals, it\u2019s weird and inappropriate.", "NTA", "NTA- I think your MIL doesn't like you for some reason. Maybe valid... maybe not. But if it was me, I'd make extra for you. It is not hard to whip up two more eggs and some bacon.   \n\nMaybe something else happened here", "NTA", "NTA. This is some of the most passive aggressive BS If I\u2019ve ever heard. Sounds like it\u2019s time to tell her that she\u2019s there to help the family, which means all of you, and if she\u2019d prefer to outline specific duties to cover, thats fine, but it\u2019s your home and she doesn\u2019t get to isolate herself and your son like a petulant teenager. \n\nYou may need to evaluate if having her there is actually helping, or just creating more stress. If having the child care is worth it, then sit down and meal plan for the rest of her visit- make a schedule and decide who is cooking what when, when you\u2019ll order out instead, and who cleans up after. Literally break down every task- if she wants to be petty, simply leave no room for interpretation, because at least then you can plan appropriately or hold her accountable.", "ESH\n\nMIL definitely started this bs for no reason and suck big time. But you could have just upfront asked her to make enough for you after the first time. Though for some reason you decided confronting her is the better option ~~after allowing this to happen for a few more times~~. Then you expect MIL to take the talking down just because it\u2019s your house and you\u2019re fed up when you didn\u2019t try to address the issue early and upfront but go around the bushes", "YTA\n\nShe's not your maid. Make your own breakfast.", "YTA. If you're asking someone to come stay at your house for a week and take care of your kid, for FREE, the least you could do is be a good host. I don't see anywhere where you cooked her anything or did anything for her whatsoever. You expected her to come to town to wait on your kid hand and foot, AND you also? She already was doing you a massive favour watching your kid, and you decided to get pissy because she didn't make YOU breakfast? Because making everyone breakfast is your \"house rules\" that you never informed her about?  And then you went to tattle on her to your husband who is sick in the hospital? \n\nYou operate under such an extreme level of pettiness that I can't believe you still have people in your life who are willing to do these huge favours for you. All I can say is that you're unbelievably rude and ungrateful, and although I hope you wouldn't dare to ask your MIL for more help in the future, I'm sure you will anyway, because you seem like an entitled asshole. YTA.", "Yta- she\u2019s there to care for her grandchild which she\u2019s doing. She\u2019s not there to be your cook. You providing the groceries that she\u2019s initially making for your child and then in turn logically feeding herself as well, is not a slight to you.", "YTA\n\nMIL came to town to provide free childcare for the duration of this emergency. Be grateful and make your own breakfast. To be honest, it sounds like she may not like you much but perhaps she finds that you act entitled from time to time.", "Soft NTA. Maybe you could have asked her, very kindly, to also leave some food for you. \n\nOkay, that was just the people-pleaser in me. Honestly, I feel like if the MIL really wanted to help you, she\u2019d do everything she could to make your lives easier. Being either passive aggressive from the start or absentminded at the start and then passive aggressive later seems very toxic. \n\nTry and find someone else to be able to rely on. You don\u2019t need this kind of toxicity right now.", "I might be downvoted for this, but YTA?\n\nShe came to provide free childcare. She is providing that. She is not required to cook for you. She is required to look after the child, and she is feeding the child. She is doing all that she is supposed to. \n\nYou telling your husband and him talking to her would be seen as you complaining about her behind her back. When she is already doing so much for you. She is annoyed and showed it in a petty way. \n\nAnd the fact you are paying for groceries, cause you made a point of that, doesn't matter. Cause she is feeding not just herself, but your child too. With the groceries. And she is providing free childcare. It's bare minimum you feed her. But she is cooking for herself too, and not bothering you. \n\nI get you are under a lot of stress. But she is doing what she agreed to. She doesn't have to do more. And wanting more is you acting entitled. You are entitled to your groceries, but not her cooking. And if you want her to pay for groceries that she used to cook for herself, better be ready to pay for childcare as well.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The host should be doing all that.", "I understand that you were raised like that. But did you offer her any meals? Because it's convenient to say that you would make enough for her if you were cooking, but I cannot see any instances of that occurring. Instead I only see your complaints that she didn't cook for you when her reason for coming was to help with your child, which she did. Maybe she was annoyed because she didn't feel appreciated as a guest. I know that if I went somewhere and offered a favour, plus I was a guest, I wouldn't expect to have to sort my own food. But if everyone was out, I'd feed myself. You weren't out though, so you should have sorted the food, or ASKED her to help you. Not just assume she'd cook for herself, your child and you.\n\nAs for the 'taking your son into her room' thing, I agree it felt a bit rude. But it really sounds like you got her to come to be a babysitter, didn't treat her like a guest (i.e. no cooked meals or spending anytime with her) and made her feel like she was there only to serve. So maybe she decided she would just focus on that. I really don't think you sound too welcoming tbh. Just very expectant that she should come, be ignored, help with your kid and cook for you. I'm confused why you don't think that is a rude way to treat a guest."]}
