This is such bizarre behaviour that it can\u2019t be anything other than an intentional slight. \n\nI get that she\u2019s there to help with childcare and not to be your full-service housekeeper, but if she\u2019s cooking your groceries for herself and your child, she should absolutely be asking if you want some too.", "First red flag for me:  I don't know of anyone that would take a child into their private room, shut the door and feed them there---and not in the kitchen. In my house, there's a rule you don't eat in bedrooms. Sometimes the living room, but the kitchen is preferred. And what was the purpose of isolating herself and your son in a closed bedroom to eat? Or isolating them in an enclosed room at all? \n\nOnce, I get. Maybe at one point, she saw you not eat breakfast, and she wrongly assumed you wouldn't want anything. All I can think is, she's mad you didn't address it with her, and her son told her. That could be the cause of the 1-piece of bacon (in her eyes, talking about her behind her back instead of confronting her directly). Okay, I'm giving her that one. I can be petty myself on occasion. Until you went on. \n\nThen, you confronted her directly and said you found it disrespectful. She turns around and tells your husband (NOT YOU) that YOU were being disrespectful. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. \n\nBottom line, this woman does not like you. She also isolates herself with your child for some odd reason. HUGE RED FLAG. Anytime someone isolates themselves from another person, I immediately question their intentions. What are they saying or doing that they need a closed door? I'm not talking about normal privacy but deliberate isolation from the household/ person when it's not necessary. Eating is something you do in the main house, or kitchen---not your bedroom with the door closed. Especially with a toddler who tends to be very messy. \n\nYou/anyone doing me a favor does not give them permission to be an asshole toward me. Yes, I'm grateful for your action in assisting me, but that doesn't mean you get to abuse me because you helped me. Now she's also manipulative. \n\nI'd tell her thank you for your time and assistance, but we have it from here. Good bye. Pack her bags and escort her to the airport. You might have to visit your husband less, or enlist the help of friends or a neighbor you trust, or hire a sitter. But you're going to be better off without this woman in your home saying God knows what to your son about you--behind closed doors. Or worse. Call me paranoid, and I am. But just because I'm paranoid doesn't mean I'm wrong. \n\nNTA", "Just\u2026.dang.\n\nI was sorta okay with her just being absent minded, but the one piece of bacon\u2026. Not gonna lie, I\u2019d have had trouble holding my tongue at that point! And I also was raised to respect my elders, but just dang!\n\nNTA\u2026 like doubly so.", "Let me add a few more things for context and a timeline: \n\nMy husband was in the hospital for a week. She arrived the afternoon before surgery. He picked her up from the airport with my son (airport runs usually aren\u2019t a family trip) so i stayed behind. Usually we go out to eat when she gets in. This time they went out to eat at a restaurant on their way home and didn\u2019t bring me anything or ask if i wanted to join them. My husband felt terrible that he forgot to ask me about food, but i told him I\u2019d just Uber. The next morning was surgery day and I wasn\u2019t home and expected nothing. 2nd morning is the day in the room with son. I tt my husband that afternoon. . On my way home, after speaking with my husband, she called him and asked if she can use my car to go visit him. When I got home, she asked where the key was. Me being confused asked her what was going on and she said my husband told her she could use my car. I gave her the keys, she left to visit. She could\u2019ve asked me herself. Anyway, this must have been when he told her what i said during her visit with him. She came home later that night with food only for herself and ate it downstairs. The tv was loud and my son was sleeping. I grabbed my son and brought him in the room with me so she wouldn\u2019t wake him. I was too tired to confront her and told myself i would address it in the am.  Which brings us to the 3rd morning. This is when she left the piece of bacon. Shortly after, she left for the airport. Honestly, i wasn\u2019t expecting her to cook and when she did i was expecting the same thing she did the day before. I was going to drop it, because confrontation sucks and she was leaving anyway. When she left the 1 piece of bacon, i felt like it was a middle finger to me which is why I addressed it. \nMy husband should\u2019ve let me handle it. But out of respect, i wanted to give him a heads up. Truthfully her actions pissed him off more than I would\u2019ve expected and I\u2019m assuming that this is why he said something to her.\n\nYes I felt slighted and disrespected in my house. And again, I may be feeling really sensitive with all the stress going on. However, I have always been really nice and accommodating to her. Always. Sometimes she just acts like I pissed in her cheerios towards me.", "NTA. Your MIL not making you breakfast while cooking for herself and your son is super petty and passive-aggressive. When she left you one piece the next day, that was malicious compliance. \"Technically, I made you something.\" BS. \n\nThat old idea of \"don't do me any favors\" comes to mind. I hate when people \"help you\" so that they can hold it over your head, mistreat you later, or resent you for it.", "[removed]", "NTA. It is very rude to just feed yourself in someone else's house with their own food while you are just sitting there being hungry.\n\nShe really doesn't like you.", "NTA, order a pizza for you and your son.", "MIL sounds pretty vindictive. NTA.", "NTA- I find her behavior disrespectful. This is your house, food, utilities, appliances, etc. she should at least ask if you would like whatever it is she is cooking. The fact she left you ONE piece of bacon is definitely being funny and assholery. That\u2019s a slap in the face. First you weren\u2019t good enough for a meal, now you\u2019re getting scrap like a dog. No ma\u2019am I don\u2019t think so. She should be grateful she is even allowed to make herself meals at all with your groceries instead of buying her own. Me being me, I would\u2019ve went to wherever she was , and took food off her plate and ate it right there in her face. Or asked your son if you could try a piece since grandma forgot to make more food for mommy. Hopefully she will be gone soon. I\u2019m sorry you feel like a ghost in your own home!", "That was pretty rude of her. NTA. Since it is your food she should have at least asked and considered you. I don't necessarily thing the same as you, but she was a guest and didn't bring her own food so bad on her. And the way she did it...wow. It's kind of a slap in the face. \n\nIf I were visiting someone I would never touch the food unless offered and even then I'm like let me help with something, i'll buy some groceries for everyone...etc.", "NTA She\u2019s doing this intentionally and I\u2019d tell her she is not allowed to shut your son in the guest room with her, because that\u2019s really weird. Even if she\u2019s just doing that to rub in the fact that she\u2019s excluding you from meals, it\u2019s weird and inappropriate.", "NTA", "NTA- I think your MIL doesn't like you for some reason. Maybe valid... maybe not. But if it was me, I'd make extra for you. It is not hard to whip up two more eggs and some bacon.   \n\nMaybe something else happened here", "NTA", "NTA. This is some of the most passive aggressive BS If I\u2019ve ever heard. Sounds like it\u2019s time to tell her that she\u2019s there to help the family, which means all of you, and if she\u2019d prefer to outline specific duties to cover, thats fine, but it\u2019s your home and she doesn\u2019t get to isolate herself and your son like a petulant teenager. \n\nYou may need to evaluate if having her there is actually helping, or just creating more stress. If having the child care is worth it, then sit down and meal plan for the rest of her visit- make a schedule and decide who is cooking what when, when you\u2019ll order out instead, and who cleans up after. Literally break down every task- if she wants to be petty, simply leave no room for interpretation, because at least then you can plan appropriately or hold her accountable.", "ESH\n\nMIL definitely started this bs for no reason and suck big time. But you could have just upfront asked her to make enough for you after the first time. Though for some reason you decided confronting her is the better option ~~after allowing this to happen for a few more times~~. Then you expect MIL to take the talking down just because it\u2019s your house and you\u2019re fed up when you didn\u2019t try to address the issue early and upfront but go around the bushes", "YTA\n\nShe's not your maid.

Be grateful and make your own breakfast. To be honest, it sounds like she may not like you much but perhaps she finds that you act entitled from time to time.", "Soft NTA. Maybe you could have asked her, very kindly, to also leave some food for you. \n\nOkay, that was just the people-pleaser in me. Honestly, I feel like if the MIL really wanted to help you, she\u2019d do everything she could to make your lives easier. Being either passive aggressive from the start or absentminded at the start and then passive aggressive later seems very toxic. \n\nTry and find someone else to be able to rely on. You don\u2019t need this kind of toxicity right now.", "I might be downvoted for this, but YTA?\n\nShe came to provide free childcare. She is providing that. She is not required to cook for you. She is required to look after the child, and she is feeding the child. She is doing all that she is supposed to. \n\nYou telling your husband and him talking to her would be seen as you complaining about her behind her back. When she is already doing so much for you. She is annoyed and showed it in a petty way. \n\nAnd the fact you are paying for groceries, cause you made a point of that, doesn't matter. Cause she is feeding not just herself, but your child too. With the groceries. And she is providing free childcare. It's bare minimum you feed her. But she is cooking for herself too, and not bothering you. \n\nI get you are under a lot of stress. But she is doing what she agreed to. She doesn't have to do more. And wanting more is you acting entitled. You are entitled to your groceries, but not her cooking. And if you want her to pay for groceries that she used to cook for herself, better be ready to pay for childcare as well.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The petty little piece of bacon left the next day was her way of telling you the level of her contempt for you personally, and she is taking bets that you won't dare retaliate because it wasn't an in-your-face insult.

You need to be more assertive, otherwise she will continue with these sort of antics.  She expects to get away with being ugly because there's no consequences, and trust me on this:  your husband taking her to task was not a consequence, as she is still under YOUR roof, eating your food, interacting with your son, and mistreating you however she pleases.  \n\nNow, I dealt with a similarly contemptuous MIL, and she did not stop until consequences started happening that affected her personally.  I chose the route of calling my MIL out with other people in the room, and making it clear that if she did not treat me with respect, she could just keep herself out from under any room that sheltered me.  I made it embarrassing, because that kind of person usually makes her insults visible only to the person to whom it's intended; others do not suspect a thing unless you speak up.  My husband backed me up on this, thankfully, and told the woman that if she didn't accept me and treat me respectfully, then none of the family would, either.

Meals are a social/bonding experience.  Ideally she would care about her daughter-in-law but the reality is that your presence in her life was not her choice. To be fair you didn't choose her either.\n\n All these people talking about the fact that she used your utilities and your groceries sound like shitty hosts. The utilities are the bare minimum of hosting a guest. The groceries are a bit more gray but if it is only one person I wouldn't expect them to pay for their own groceries. If you expected otherwise that is something you settle before they arrive. \n\nThe actual issue here is the disrespect in literally yoinking your child from you, going to the guest room, and closing the door to eat a meal with the kid. 1. You don't eat in a bedroom unless you are a savage or live in a studio apartment. Hard no.\n2. Literally excluding you from time with your kid while you are caring for them. If you are there she is not on duty.\n\nThe only explanation I can think of here is that she hates your guts but is willing to put up with you to some extent so she can have a place in her son's and grandchild's lives. \n\nIn this scenario she agrees to care for her son's kid and does so. She cooks for the kid because in her head that is what she is there to do. She isn't going to let the food go to waste just because you are still there so she takes the kid to feed him where you aren't explicitly welcome. She contacts your son for permission to use his car and then asks you for the keys after getting his permission (Edit: reread that comment and saw that is was your car which makes this weird ). Her son tells her that you are talking shit behind her back (or that is what she hears) and that you expect her to feed a grown ass woman. She gets pissed off and leaves the one piece of bacon to make it clear what she thinks of your entitlement. \n\nI don't actually know what is going on inside her head. Other commenters have mentioned that she might be poisoning your kid against you. I don't know  and neither do they. I would assume that you talk to your kid about what they did that day and would have heard hints about that but again, I don't know. If that sounds possible investigate. \n\nIn general E S H. Whatever her deal is, she acted inappropriately as a guest within your home. I don't think it is her responsibility to cook for you unless she explicitly agreed to and YTA for acting like it is your god-given right. With that said, she agreed to live in the same house as you but then purposely excludes you from something usually communal like meals and takes some of the little time you have with your kid. It is her right not to cook for you but she sucks for not packing away her damage to help her son's family in this situation. \n\nShe is making no effort to cultivate a positive relationship with you. Take that for what it is and figure out what you are willing to deal with. Have an adult conversation and establish rules of engagement from the ground up. None of this \"in my family we . . .\" shit. The majority of humanity didn't grow up in your household and expecting anyone to adhere to the expectations you built there is stupid. \n\nTL;DR based on the question asked YTA because she doesn't owe you her labor. Based on the situation E S H because she is fucking rude about it but that wasn't your question.\n\nEdit: i thought about it and it might be N T A because it sounds like MIL wasn't honest about how she felt. People don't need to like each other but it is a part of being a healthy adult that you act in a courteous manner. If your usual social courtesies aren't enough to lubricate you interactions than you talk and establish new ones for your particular relationship. I haven't changed my judgement because as far as I know OP hasn't clarified their relationship prior to this incident. 3", "That was mean spirited. NTA. I am one to not mince words she would have gotten an ear full. And I would have told her \"We eat at the table NOT in the bedrooms like hillbillies\" then I would tell her if I find one cockroach she WILL be paying for the exterminator. When I saw my husband I would let him know what I said verbatim and I would look for a temporary nanny to care for the child. You don't have to be treated like that in your own house. Sorry your husband was injured I hope he is on the mend.", "My FIL made a food I am allergic to when I had just given birth. I had leftovers. I understand your feelings.", "NTA this is really weird! I am sorry this is happening to you! I would recommend having a sit down. When the time is right maybe make two cups of tea and explain, \n\n\u201cHi Jane I appreciate your help, this situation is really stressful, I\u2019m scared about my husband and I\u2019m exhausted, you being here is nice, I would like for things to be better, we are family and we\u2019re going through a struggle right now it\u2019s best if we stick together. Could you please explain your side of the breakfast situation?\u201d", "Info: has MIL had an opportunity to see her son in the hospital? Is there some sort of \u201cif all I\u2019m good for is childcare than all I\u2019ll do is childcare\u201d?", "Looks like low key has an issue with you Maybe you should confront her.", "You need to nip this in the bud. She sounds like the kind of person to sabotage your son against you. She\u2019s already taking care of him and secreting him away into her room to eat - WHY? That absolutely must be answered. If your son is old enough, find out what she is saying when you\u2019re not around. And literally put your foot down. Age means jack all, it\u2019s your house, your son, and your rules. You may even want to warn her that this childish behavior of hers will not be tolerated.", "I just had to comment on the going in the bedroom to eat alone with your son. As opposed to like, where people would normally eat? That's such bizarre behavior, and I think you should ask your husband why she does that or have an open conversation to figure why that is before you bother with the not making food for you part. That's concerning, and that's got to have more to it than just passive aggressively pretending like you don't live there.\n\nNTA. Something is up.", "You are definitely NTA and what she is doing is so bizarre. But question: had you asked her if she wanted to visit her son in the hospital with you? Sure she could have asked you, but did you offer?", "Definitely NTA.  It's just rude.  Yes, she's there doing you a favor, but if she's cooking for herself and grandson, with the food, cooking utensils and utilities you work to provide, the least she can do is make a couple extra eggs a bacon.", "NTA\n\nGonna be honest, the more alarming thing to me is that MIL took her grandson into her own room and shut the door (thought she said \u201clocked the door\u201d, but it seems it was just closed).  What the actual F***?  Maybe it\u2019s a cultural thing?  Even so, that is suss as hell.\nGranted, I might be paranoid (binging a lot of crime shows probably doesn\u2019t help).  But combine that with MIL only making food for herself and the grandson\u2026 it just feels\u2026 off.  Like something might be happening or being said behind closed doors that MIL knows OP will not approve of.  Might be worth talking to the grandson and making sure he\u2019s okay.\n\nBut back to the original question.  No, OP, you are NTA.", "This is a monster in law type woman who sees their son\u2019s partners as incubators for grandchildren. Then they view the grandchildren as another extension of themselves. Hence why she felt so comfortable just taking OP\u2019s child out of the room they were playing in with no explanation. OP isn\u2019t a person to MIL. This is such shitty and toxic behavior this woman should NEVER be welcomed back. Stay in a hotel.", "What other expectations are you talking about apart an extra piece of bacon and an extra couple of eggs, that would be cooked not separately but together with what is being cooked anyway?", "You know, people have tongues, and most of us can use them. It is not difficult to say \"DIL, would you like bacon and eggs?\"", "She just doesn\u2019t want to answer any toddler questions about why mommy doesn\u2019t have any breakfast", "Husband should have told his mother to ask OP directly. It\u2019s her car, damnit!", "Put them in writing so she doesn\u2019t \u201cforget.\u201d", "That sounds so adult. I was going to suggest 1) mailing a Thank You card for her help, but also a PS returning her last piece of bacon she left behind; and 2) if she must come back to your home remove all internal doors and ask I friend to store them until she leaves - tell her you sent them out to be cleaned. But I\u2019m childish and petty.", "Yeah I\u2019m a little confused. Op makes it sound like husband is on her side and really supportive but this car thing seems to contradict that", "And then a single slice from the same package for every holiday after that until it runs out. Dry bacon jerky forever!", "Yes they are. That's why I like animals more they don't give me headaches.", "Definitely. This screams of help that isn't really help.", "Damn true! Human are unpredictable and complicated. My MIL was so nice for the first 10 years of our marriage then suddenly snapped out last time when we were visiting and staying with them. Suddenly she showed her true colors and how much she hated me. That incident made me realize that human are great actors and big liars! Animals would never do that.", "This exactly", "NTA by a long stretch. MIL has a great big \u2018mommy dearest\u2019 sized chip on her shoulders. She needed to be called out for her petty actions. Never give this woman an inch as she will undoubtedly take a mile.", "NTA\n\nAny posibillity of being quick? When she's done cooking, casually grab her plate, smile nicely, say 'thank you' and eat it. If she complains, tell her these are your groceries, both you and your husband had told her about the rules, and you assumed she understood and this was her apology. \n\nAnyway, this need to be adressed firmly and clearly, as she's playing a power game in YOUR house. \n\nDo you have any other option than having her there?", "MIL *suckssss* you are most definitely NTA", "Man... I'm an AH, I would take her plate and say thanks. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Most toddlers go to bed fairly early, so I would assume it was a late lunch or maybe dinner the day before surgery.

She can take care of her own", "Fair enough.", "The OP says otherwise. She claims the MIL is a \"guest\" several times in her post and comments.", "Stand your ground.\n\nI am not going to say she would do anything.\n\nNo adult should be teaching a child to go behind closed doors with them like that. (Mom, Dad, doctor. Period) when I babysat, the parents always had a key to my house and could walk in while their child was with there with no notice. My bedroom door was always closed and locked. Children going potty could lock the door (if they needed help going potty that door was not locked).\n\nI went above and beyond to make sure parents knew that we were not teaching children to keep secrets. Taught parents that it was 100% their right to make sure their child was safe.\n\nI know I seem like I'm over reacting. Kind of hard not to. Children should not be taught to hide from their parents or to be sneaky with adults like that.\n\nShe should be teaching your child how to be safe. Not how to close you out and keep secrets.", "Out of all of it. That is the part that makes me mad the most.\n\nShe is working to provide for her family and being treated like that by MIL?\n\nA good MIL would have made breakfast, called the both to the table and eaten as a family. Taken advantage of the time they have together.\n\nI have a really hard time with MILs that treat their D/SIL like the enemy.", "Don\u2019t forget the bacon mints!\n\nOr better, do forget the bacon mints. Those are NASTY.", "I think it's a matter of definitions. We can call MIL a guest or something else, but my point stands - MIL didn't come to do OP a favour, she came because of her son.", "Lol It was a fair takedown of mine.", "So is MIL. So don't forget them.", "But the OP actually laid out what the definition of what \"guest\" was supposed to do in her view (she expects her guests to make her food if they're making food). \n\nALso I don't get your point in regards to my comment, because MY point was that this woman is NOT a guest, as she's doing them a favor by watching their kid (doesn't matter whether she's doing it for the husband or wife; they're BOTH benefiting from it).  I think it's rude for the OP to expect this woman to cook her breakfast when she's already woken up to cook and care for her child (i can't imagine having the audacity to complain about it!).", "Tell your MIL but there\u2019s no eating allowed in the bedrooms. Find a friend find a neighbor find someone but kick her out and then take care of your family with somebody else\u2019s help.", "The one piece of bacon makes you NTA fursure, but prior, I just want to say that it wasn\u2019t normal in my household to make more unless someone asked. Like if I smelled someone making food (insanely big family, too little rooms to fit us all, low income) I would go in and ask if they could make a little more for me too. \n\nI think your MIL was playing with you the next time, but it seems she\u2019s there to help with her grandchild while her son is in the hospital. If you want more than that, it should be a conversation. \n\nMy grandma who would come and live with us to watch over my brother and I as children only made enough for us. She never made more to put in the fridge for my mom to access. Personally I think she only only did that because she specifically came over to help my mom who became a single parent with us.", "NTA Your MIL is being blatantly disrespectful.  Send her home and get someone else to help you with your son. You may have to hire a babysitter or a nanny for a bit.", "NTA", "NTA.  Talk about passive aggressive.   MIL can head on home.", "ESH\n\nYes, it is kind of rude of her. But she is taking care of your kid. \n\nYou have bigger problems than this. And the fact that you brought it to your husband was in the hospital is really shitty.", "Still ESH. \n\nHonestly, you especially suck I think in this situation for bringing such a trivial issue to your husband who is in the hospital. Why would you even raise this while he\u2019s recovering?", "How about the situation:\n\nHusband is in the hospital for a week \n\nWife brings him problems from home to unload on him in the hospital \n\nHusband is stuck between a rock and a hard place trying to stop a conflict from arising when he cannot physically be present in the home", "Clearly, this issue could have waited until your husband was out of the hospital.", "I think I remember seeing bacon bandaids awhile ago, you could use those in place of tape when wrapping the presents!", "UMMM maybe because you\u2019re about to go into the hospital for some sort of procedure, or currently sick"]}
