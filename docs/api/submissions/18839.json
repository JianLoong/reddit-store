This is such bizarre behaviour that it can\u2019t be anything other than an intentional slight. \n\nI get that she\u2019s there to help with childcare and not to be your full-service housekeeper, but if she\u2019s cooking your groceries for herself and your child, she should absolutely be asking if you want some too.", "First red flag for me:  I don't know of anyone that would take a child into their private room, shut the door and feed them there---and not in the kitchen. In my house, there's a rule you don't eat in bedrooms. Sometimes the living room, but the kitchen is preferred. And what was the purpose of isolating herself and your son in a closed bedroom to eat? Or isolating them in an enclosed room at all? \n\nOnce, I get. Maybe at one point, she saw you not eat breakfast, and she wrongly assumed you wouldn't want anything. All I can think is, she's mad you didn't address it with her, and her son told her. That could be the cause of the 1-piece of bacon (in her eyes, talking about her behind her back instead of confronting her directly). Okay, I'm giving her that one. I can be petty myself on occasion. Until you went on. \n\nThen, you confronted her directly and said you found it disrespectful. She turns around and tells your husband (NOT YOU) that YOU were being disrespectful. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. \n\nBottom line, this woman does not like you. She also isolates herself with your child for some odd reason. HUGE RED FLAG. Anytime someone isolates themselves from another person, I immediately question their intentions. What are they saying or doing that they need a closed door? I'm not talking about normal privacy but deliberate isolation from the household/ person when it's not necessary. Eating is something you do in the main house, or kitchen---not your bedroom with the door closed. Especially with a toddler who tends to be very messy. \n\nYou/anyone doing me a favor does not give them permission to be an asshole toward me. Yes, I'm grateful for your action in assisting me, but that doesn't mean you get to abuse me because you helped me. Now she's also manipulative. \n\nI'd tell her thank you for your time and assistance, but we have it from here. Good bye. Pack her bags and escort her to the airport. You might have to visit your husband less, or enlist the help of friends or a neighbor you trust, or hire a sitter. But you're going to be better off without this woman in your home saying God knows what to your son about you--behind closed doors. Or worse. Call me paranoid, and I am. But just because I'm paranoid doesn't mean I'm wrong. \n\nNTA", "Just\u2026.dang.\n\nI was sorta okay with her just being absent minded, but the one piece of bacon\u2026. Not gonna lie, I\u2019d have had trouble holding my tongue at that point! And I also was raised to respect my elders, but just dang!\n\nNTA\u2026 like doubly so.", "Let me add a few more things for context and a timeline: \n\nMy husband was in the hospital for a week. She arrived the afternoon before surgery. He picked her up from the airport with my son (airport runs usually aren\u2019t a family trip) so i stayed behind. Usually we go out to eat when she gets in. This time they went out to eat at a restaurant on their way home and didn\u2019t bring me anything or ask if i wanted to join them. My husband felt terrible that he forgot to ask me about food, but i told him I\u2019d just Uber. The next morning was surgery day and I wasn\u2019t home and expected nothing. 2nd morning is the day in the room with son. I tt my husband that afternoon. . On my way home, after speaking with my husband, she called him and asked if she can use my car to go visit him. When I got home, she asked where the key was. Me being confused asked her what was going on and she said my husband told her she could use my car. I gave her the keys, she left to visit. She could\u2019ve asked me herself. Anyway, this must have been when he told her what i said during her visit with him. She came home later that night with food only for herself and ate it downstairs. The tv was loud and my son was sleeping. I grabbed my son and brought him in the room with me so she wouldn\u2019t wake him. I was too tired to confront her and told myself i would address it in the am.  Which brings us to the 3rd morning. This is when she left the piece of bacon. Shortly after, she left for the airport. Honestly, i wasn\u2019t expecting her to cook and when she did i was expecting the same thing she did the day before. I was going to drop it, because confrontation sucks and she was leaving anyway. When she left the 1 piece of bacon, i felt like it was a middle finger to me which is why I addressed it. \nMy husband should\u2019ve let me handle it. But out of respect, i wanted to give him a heads up. Truthfully her actions pissed him off more than I would\u2019ve expected and I\u2019m assuming that this is why he said something to her.\n\nYes I felt slighted and disrespected in my house. And again, I may be feeling really sensitive with all the stress going on. However, I have always been really nice and accommodating to her. Always. Sometimes she just acts like I pissed in her cheerios towards me.", "NTA. Your MIL not making you breakfast while cooking for herself and your son is super petty and passive-aggressive. When she left you one piece the next day, that was malicious compliance. \"Technically, I made you something.\" BS. \n\nThat old idea of \"don't do me any favors\" comes to mind. I hate when people \"help you\" so that they can hold it over your head, mistreat you later, or resent you for it.", "[removed]", "NTA.

The fact she left you ONE piece of bacon is definitely being funny and assholery. That\u2019s a slap in the face. First you weren\u2019t good enough for a meal, now you\u2019re getting scrap like a dog. No ma\u2019am I don\u2019t think so. She should be grateful she is even allowed to make herself meals at all with your groceries instead of buying her own. Me being me, I would\u2019ve went to wherever she was , and took food off her plate and ate it right there in her face. Or asked your son if you could try a piece since grandma forgot to make more food for mommy. Hopefully she will be gone soon. I\u2019m sorry you feel like a ghost in your own home!", "That was pretty rude of her. NTA. Since it is your food she should have at least asked and considered you. I don't necessarily thing the same as you, but she was a guest and didn't bring her own food so bad on her. And the way she did it...wow. It's kind of a slap in the face. \n\nIf I were visiting someone I would never touch the food unless offered and even then I'm like let me help with something, i'll buy some groceries for everyone...etc.", "NTA She\u2019s doing this intentionally and I\u2019d tell her she is not allowed to shut your son in the guest room with her, because that\u2019s really weird. Even if she\u2019s just doing that to rub in the fact that she\u2019s excluding you from meals, it\u2019s weird and inappropriate.", "NTA", "NTA- I think your MIL doesn't like you for some reason. Maybe valid... maybe not. But if it was me, I'd make extra for you. It is not hard to whip up two more eggs and some bacon.   \n\nMaybe something else happened here", "NTA", "NTA. This is some of the most passive aggressive BS If I\u2019ve ever heard. Sounds like it\u2019s time to tell her that she\u2019s there to help the family, which means all of you, and if she\u2019d prefer to outline specific duties to cover, thats fine, but it\u2019s your home and she doesn\u2019t get to isolate herself and your son like a petulant teenager. \n\nYou may need to evaluate if having her there is actually helping, or just creating more stress. If having the child care is worth it, then sit down and meal plan for the rest of her visit- make a schedule and decide who is cooking what when, when you\u2019ll order out instead, and who cleans up after. Literally break down every task- if she wants to be petty, simply leave no room for interpretation, because at least then you can plan appropriately or hold her accountable.", "ESH\n\nMIL definitely started this bs for no reason and suck big time. But you could have just upfront asked her to make enough for you after the first time. Though for some reason you decided confronting her is the better option ~~after allowing this to happen for a few more times~~. Then you expect MIL to take the talking down just because it\u2019s your house and you\u2019re fed up when you didn\u2019t try to address the issue early and upfront but go around the bushes", "YTA\n\nShe's not your maid.

I don't see anywhere where you cooked her anything or did anything for her whatsoever. You expected her to come to town to wait on your kid hand and foot, AND you also? She already was doing you a massive favour watching your kid, and you decided to get pissy because she didn't make YOU breakfast? Because making everyone breakfast is your \"house rules\" that you never informed her about?  And then you went to tattle on her to your husband who is sick in the hospital? \n\nYou operate under such an extreme level of pettiness that I can't believe you still have people in your life who are willing to do these huge favours for you. All I can say is that you're unbelievably rude and ungrateful, and although I hope you wouldn't dare to ask your MIL for more help in the future, I'm sure you will anyway, because you seem like an entitled asshole.

Be grateful and make your own breakfast. To be honest, it sounds like she may not like you much but perhaps she finds that you act entitled from time to time.", "Soft NTA. Maybe you could have asked her, very kindly, to also leave some food for you. \n\nOkay, that was just the people-pleaser in me. Honestly, I feel like if the MIL really wanted to help you, she\u2019d do everything she could to make your lives easier. Being either passive aggressive from the start or absentminded at the start and then passive aggressive later seems very toxic. \n\nTry and find someone else to be able to rely on. You don\u2019t need this kind of toxicity right now.", "I might be downvoted for this, but YTA?\n\nShe came to provide free childcare. She is providing that. She is not required to cook for you. She is required to look after the child, and she is feeding the child. She is doing all that she is supposed to. \n\nYou telling your husband and him talking to her would be seen as you complaining about her behind her back. When she is already doing so much for you. She is annoyed and showed it in a petty way. \n\nAnd the fact you are paying for groceries, cause you made a point of that, doesn't matter. Cause she is feeding not just herself, but your child too. With the groceries. And she is providing free childcare. It's bare minimum you feed her. But she is cooking for herself too, and not bothering you. \n\nI get you are under a lot of stress. But she is doing what she agreed to. She doesn't have to do more. And wanting more is you acting entitled. You are entitled to your groceries, but not her cooking. And if you want her to pay for groceries that she used to cook for herself, better be ready to pay for childcare as well.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This sequence of events is so weird to me, I don\u2019t even understand how she did that without weirding you out? So she came upstairs, breakfast tray in one hand, picks up your son \u2013 no, she can\u2019t carry him with the tray \u2013 so she tells your son to come with her and he follows her to the guest room and she closes the door? Just leaving you there sitting on the floor of your son\u2019s room? Did she say anything to you? Did she tell your son, \u2018Come here, have breakfast with grandma\u2019 and then just leave you? Didn\u2019t it strike you as super odd in the moment that she would take him to the guest room and CLOSE THE DOOR? Does she always close doors in the house, is it some kind of reflex? I just can\u2019t picture how this happened.", "NTA. She would be out of my house. Period. Nobody has time for these games. She did it because nobody checks her on her behavior.", "NTA. Has she expressed that she doesn't like you before? That's such a weird thing to do", "NTA. Clearly, your MIL is signaling she doesn't like you (the closed door with giving your child breakfadt) and sounds like she's trying to pick a fight so she can whine to her hospitalized son about it.\n\nWas your relationship strained before this?", "NTA. However, she is doing that on purpose. Some people love to create caos and cause havoc, you are just helping her by behaving this offended.\n\nIn my opinion just ignore her. She is helping with you son, and loving on him while your husband recovers.", "NTA", "NTA. And it\u2019s good your husband addressed it. Less for her to get away with. Mil does not like you. She should not take your kid to a room to feed him unless I\u2019m missing context here -  it was to hide and feed him in secret so she wouldn\u2019t have to do anything for you. It\u2019s off behavior. Shut it down.", "NTA. She's being intentionally rude at a time when she should be going out of her way to be kind.\n\nI'm curious if this is always how she treats you or if it's new. Either way though, I wouldn't let her rope you into her games. It's some twisted power play and people like that delight in getting reactions, proving she can upset you. Whatever she does don't show it bothers you in the least (because that's what she wants) and just count down the days until she leaves. Later, though, when your husband is home, you should probably have a discussion about how she treats you and think about how much you want to engage with her.", "I\u2019d tell her after this visit she\u2019s no longer welcome, and tell your husband his mother disrespected you in your own home.

That was glaringly obvious when she chose to cook breakfast for only your son and herself, as well as in her consuming that breakfast in a closed room that kept you out.  The petty little piece of bacon left the next day was her way of telling you the level of her contempt for you personally, and she is taking bets that you won't dare retaliate because it wasn't an in-your-face insult.  It was passive-aggressiveness meant to let you know that you can tell her son whatever you want, she is still going to do as she pleases while she is there, and there is nothing you can do to stop her.\n\nUnfortunately, your politeness and your silence is being taken by your MIL as permission for her to treat you as poorly as possible.  You need to be more assertive, otherwise she will continue with these sort of antics.  She expects to get away with being ugly because there's no consequences, and trust me on this:  your husband taking her to task was not a consequence, as she is still under YOUR roof, eating your food, interacting with your son, and mistreating you however she pleases.  \n\nNow, I dealt with a similarly contemptuous MIL, and she did not stop until consequences started happening that affected her personally.  I chose the route of calling my MIL out with other people in the room, and making it clear that if she did not treat me with respect, she could just keep herself out from under any room that sheltered me.  I made it embarrassing, because that kind of person usually makes her insults visible only to the person to whom it's intended; others do not suspect a thing unless you speak up.  My husband backed me up on this, thankfully, and told the woman that if she didn't accept me and treat me respectfully, then none of the family would, either.  It took six months of us studiously avoiding her for her to understand that her nastiness would not be tolerated.  You can't make the woman love you, but you CAN get her to quit acting like a sullen 12 year-old if you respond appropriately.

It's called not taking sh-t, and establishing boundaries.", "NTA,  but how do you feel about these actions?\n\n Your husband tells his mother she can borrow your car without asking you. \n\nYou tell your husband about the breakfast situation, and he tells directly to his mother.\n\nHe goes to dinner with his son and mother and forgets to ask if you need food.", "Soft YTA\n\nI feel the same way about cooking as you, but she was a guest there to take care of your child.\n\nShe cooked breakfast to feed your kid, primarily, and maybe even thought she was doing you a favor by bringing him in the room to feed him so you could go on about your day without interruption.\n\nYour husband exhibited manners similar to his mother by not picking up food for you or asking you if you wanted to join them for dinner - it seems like their family manners are overall different than yours.

I know that was a major boundary for both my husband and myself when it came to our son. We absolutely refused to leave him alone with anyone (including family) who didn't like or at the least, respect us both. Kids are impressionable and the last thing a child needs is to be around is someone who is shit talking one or both of their parents.

He's a keeper for that alone! \n\nHope his recovery is going well.", "NTA. Tell her it\u2019s your house, you bought the food, and if she is incapable of making enough for everyone in the house, to stop cooking in your kitchen.

More like an unpaid nanny? Cause that's basically what she is.
