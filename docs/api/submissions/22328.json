Or the mom could have lied to him and told him that op knew her sister was coming while lying to op that it was just going to be the three of them.", "All your comments can just be boiled down to you don't trust young people, and older people are always right.\n\nGood for you.", "Thank you, agreed", "Geeze you're on a personal mission to shoot my opinion down lol", "Here is the paragraph\n\nMy dad says he knows why I did and he understands. But he says I should have let him know so he didn't waste money. He said he would have gone along with my ruse\n\nThere is nothing in that paragraph that suggests she knew before getting to the airport that her sister would be going \n\nI took what her dad said to mean \" if you didnt want to go to Disneyland at all, wish you wouldve told me before i bought the tickets\"\n\nIm not sure the dad realized the sister being there is why OP changed her mind, i think  he thought she didnt want to go from day 1 when they began discussing it and therefore he wishes she wouldve told them at the beginning and he wouldve supported her and went along with her not going.\n\nHis comment.suggest HE knew in advance the sister was going to be there, but nothing about it suggests OP knew, imo.", "It was last second because she found out her sister and kids were going on the trip at the last second, like it explains in the post you couldn't be bothered to read.\n\n>I asked who was going and they said it was just the three of us. \n\n>But when we got to the airport my sister and her family were there. Strangely enough they were also going to Disneyland. \n\nI've highlighted the relevant sections for you.", "You seem to be struggling, I\u2019m not going to kick a dead horse- refer to JohnJohnstons comment", "Hahaha you're wrong and got called out and can't handle it.", "That's what I think too. I have a feeling dad is whipped since he hasn't confronted his wife directly about this. There's also no way in hell this man wants to go to Disneyland, especially without his kid lmao", "NTA\n\n> My dad says he knows why I did and he understands. But he says I should have let him know so he didn't waste money. He said he would have gone along with my ruse.\n\nOP, let your dad know that if he'd only let you in on their nefarious plans before you all got to the airport, then he could have refunded the tickets, or not paid for them in the first place.", "Facsimile it to your best friend too.  Plus UPS a copy to the White House.", "In advance!", "Also\n\n>He said he would have gone along with my ruse.\n\nThe whole point of the trip was supposed to be rewarding OP, and his suggested solution is leaving her behind on purpose. And probably still let her be berated by mom and sister. Nope, that selfish AH deserved to pay the AH tax.", ">so he didn't waste money.\n\nThat's the focus, Dad? Not wasting your relationship with your daughter?", "Right? They tricked the poster first with the lie this was for her graduation.", "Yeah. Forget \u201che should have warned her\u201d. He should have told his wife they weren\u2019t lying to and tricking their kid in the first place. This should never have gotten to be OPs problem to solve even if they had forewarning. NTA", "Happy wife happy life. The dad is a doormat and just goes along with whatever the women want to avoid confrontation. It's these women that create the whole ball and chain, women are always right, who wears the pants around the house joke.", "Easy when the father tells OP the real purpose of the journey instead of leading her on with \"it's only our 3, it's to celebrate your graduation\"", "This but with my mom placating my dad. He didn't volunteer me for things but he was almost always yelling at me. I still live at home but the only reason it's gotten better is because he's gone to therapy.", "I think y\u2019all have hit the nail on the head here. Mom and Sis probably just expected it to work bc OP has always gone along with it.", "I think they meant roll vs role.", "Not sure why the attack was warranted, this disagreement isn\u2019t personal. Find peace", "Never should be a screaming match, even though it is a possibility. And if OP's parents or sister turns it into one in a public setting that is 100% on them not OP.\n\n I actually think that the public setting might make her family check they're behaviour and stop them from being more of an AH than they already were, I'd hope so anyway. \n\nAnd I agree they shouldn't have deceived her, deception is bad. That's why I don't like the way OP handled it. I just don't like deception period, but it's definitely worse to use it to take advantage of someone than to use it to get out of something. I agree walking away is right in this situation, just dislike the deception part.", "Your privilege is crazy.", "Mom could have lied and told dad she let OP know sister was coming and OP was okay with it", ">Dad could just be talking out his ass\n\nThis one!", "Says who, you? This isn't a young vs old issue. FYI I'm happy OP got out of there and avoided a week of babysitting hell. I just think she knew before hand.", "Well, your opinion is crap, so...", "Making stuff up isn't an opinion lmao.\n\nYou know what, fine. I don't think OP even has a family. She made all of this up. She actually enjoyed a lovely day at disneyland all on her own. That is my opinion and you can't prove me wrong.", "But did you highlight the section that I'm specifically referencing or did you only highlight the sections that make your argument look better?", "Yup. How was OP supposed to let him know if she didn\u2019t know sister and kids were coming until they got to the airport? \n\nThink it through dude.", "NTA. No sympathy for the dad, he deserves to lose the money. He went along with the lie knowing how hurtful it would be for his daughter, and how miserable her holiday would be. It was cruel to promise her a graduation treat, knowing they were going to disappoint her and use her yet again. And if he complains about the money when he gets back, she should point that out to him.", "Exactly. Dad could have prevented wasting his money 100%, but he chose not to. He\u2019s also TA for not standing up for OP.", "Yeah, it's very telling that it's 'my mom and sister' instead of 'my sister and her husband' complaining. Sister's husband expects his in-laws to take greater responsibility for his own children. Both women blame the 17 year old instead of making him pull his weight.", "Or maybe, just maaaaybe the dad enjoys being a grandfather and loves taking care of the kids and doesnt whine about it on social media..kinda like most of the fathers abd grandfathrts I know, my own included.", "Why would an ~~uncle-in-law~~ **edit: grandfather** provide childcare for ~~his wife's sisters'~~ **kids**, on a vacation?\n\nWouldn't childcare default to the... Parent of the kids? If she's trying to pawn off the kids, that's not patriarchy, that's just bad parenting.\n\nEdit: clarified relationships, I was seeing OPs Dad as uncle to grandkids, not grandfather.", "Maybe the Dad just looked after the kids without complaint?", "Oof you're right! Thank you for pointing that out to me.", "That's true. You're right about his behaviour in general. But in this specific case he can't say that she should have told him she didn't want to go when he intentionally kept important information from her.", "Of not forcing my children on other people and not trying to trick someone on a holiday to be an unpaid babysitter so they can't enjoy the holiday but I can.\n\nOk then I am privileged.", "I feel like this is what happened. Or OP actually asked mom if sister was coming and mom lied knowing that OP would not go if the kids did. Dad just assumed that OP knew the whole family was going", "Probably just plane tickets. They will refund park tickets.", "You\u2019re welcome to not believe whatever you like. These are the facts as presented to us and that is all we can judge on.", "It's not a young vs old issue but your main argument is OP is 17 and you don't believe them.\n\nOkay.", "Hey it's ok to read something and critically think about what you read. It's ok to see clues and make guesses on what you think happened. Hey news flash people lie and people leave out details to make themselves look better. Based on what OP wrote about her dad's reaction I think she may have known before hand. It's not beyond a doubt that someone would twist a story for internet points or to make themselves look right. It's done every single day across social media. Come back to planet Earth please.", "I highlighted the part that shows you are completely making something up.", "100% this.\n\nOP isn't a mind reader, and also is NTA.", "In other words mom runs the house with the sister and dad does as told. Dad needs to stand up instead of guilt tripping OP for not letting him know. For all OP knows dad would do anything to keep mom from wringing his sack for not making sure she got her way. I'm sure BIL is another wonderful piece of work in the situation.", "Exactly. He said he knew why she faked out. Which means he\u2019s been thinking about things and looking at the free babysitter situation for quite some time and part of him knew it was very wrong. He knew and he let things continue and not once did he put a stop to it. \n\nPoor OP, only 17 and has no one in her corner.\n\nNTA. You\u2019re so close to getting out and going to college. Do the very best you can and maybe make it a point to not come back home for every break. I have a feeling your breaks will turn into a workload from your sister.", "They will be all surprised when in a few years, OP moves out and that shit doesn't fly anymore!\n\nIn my family there's a case where the husband complained it's so much work with all the 3 Kids. So you ask him , if it's too much, why get so many? Well, when we had them we were basically relying on both grandmas to play a very actively role. Now both have health issues and we have to do it alone.", "Or her husband doesn't mind taking care of his kid/doesn't complain about it on fb", "It doesn't have to be telling. She might not even have her sisters' husband on social media, since he's not part of her core family, he might not have social media, or rarely post on it.\n\nIt's far more rare for men to post online to complain about such things.\n\nYou may be right of course, but please don't jump to conclusions.", "It's nice that this is true for your life, but it's not what's Happening here. She Pointed out that for the visit they (everyone!) Stick the Kids to her. So we can answer that question already without looking at the vacation itself.", "There is no uncle in law", "Childcare default would of course be the parents. So, male parent seems to not be doing shit, at least there's no hint to any childcare related activity. As this is Reddit, of course I assumed the worst of him.\n\nSo that means the female Parent would do it. But she whines to her Mum (or sister? You got me confused with that uncle comment) how hard her life is. Mom, knowing the Patriarchal deadbeat, wants to give her daughter a break. She Kind of voluntold her other sister and assigned childcare duties to her.\n\nAnd that could have been the Dads time to shine: after years of forced Babysitting of his daughter he's finally fed up. He offers childcare to a) give his daughter a break on vacation and b) embarrass the male parent to Show that apparently even while having male genitalia you really can do childcare!\n\nThe cycle I just sketched is like the whole thing that built up over the years, it's not exclusively for the vacation.", "They are talking about the father of the kids. The man who is married to OP\u2019s sister, and is on the vacation with them. Childcare should default to the\u2026Mother AND Father of the kids.", "They're talking about the father and grandfather of the kids.", "What are you talking about?    \nOP is the aunt, and she is not married.    \nThere is no uncle or uncle-in-law in this situation.    \n\nIn relation to the children, there is:    \nGrandma  *(OP's Mom)*    \nGrandpa *(OP's Dad)*    \nMom *(OP's Sister)*    \nDad  *(OP's Brother-inlaw)*    \nAunt *(OP herself)*", "OP's dad is the grandfather of the children in question.", "My brother NEVER watches my kids because I never ask him to.  The most he's ever done is physically hold the stroller so I can run into the bathroom if we're in public.  They're my children, my responsibility.", "Yes I would hate to be stuck at Disneyland with my niblings. If you think wasting Disney and plane tickets isn\u2019t a big deal then that\u2019s what makes you privileged.", "That's not my main argument. It definitely influenced it a little. Dad asked why she didn't tell him beforehand hand. She never says she told her dad she didn't know. She was very detailed so why would she let that detail slip? Why wouldn't she tell her dad that she didn't know her sister was coming?", "Making stuff up is not critical thinking. You're not 'reading between the lines' here, you're flat out fabricating information in direct contradiction to the facts we've been given.", "Again you are clearly avoiding my comment and refuse to acknowledge the section I'm referring to.", "So basically they\u2019re surprised that time exists and people get old.", ">*OP moves out*\n\nYeah, like that\u2019ll stop them. I think it was just yesterday that we had \u201cAITA for not following my sister\u2019s rules for her kids\u201d because sister drops her kids off with her work-from-home sibling (who lives on her own!). I\u2019d prepare to go LC or NC when you move out, because it\u2019s never going to stop. Guess who\u2019s the golden child and who\u2019s the scapegoat. \ud83d\ude12", "If he did such a great job taking care of his kids, then OP wouldn't have felt the need to \"lose\" her passport.", "If the parents had not have lied and manipulated the whole thing none  of this would have happened if they had been honest then OP could have declined and no money would have been wasted.\n\nAnd going to Disneyland with your niblings and being forced to watch them are 2 completely different things.\n\nThe parents waisted the money themselves.", "Again trying to put all the blame on the 17 year old lmao.", "Hahahaahahaaa you can't handle disagreement and correction.", "They planned getting older only for their Kids ;-) Seriously, I think the forgot that being old is often paired with being sick or disabled... It somehow didn't cross their anti vaxcer mind that you could eat healthy and Go. To the gym and what not and still get sick.", "No I'm not. If she did know she should learn to stand up for herself and say something. Sucks she feels like she can't speak her mind, her life would be a lot happier if she did.\n\nAnd you contradict yourself. You imply that I don't trust young people when I should, then you say I'm putting blame on a 17 year old implying she's too young to take any blame. Which way is it?"]}
