It's my family (wife and 2 well-behaved kids), my father-in-law and his new family, and my sister-in-law, whose kids are terrible and she absolutely sucks as a mom and at choosing her baby daddies. Anyway, we all went out for dinner to plan a bit more about our trip. When my sister-in-law said, \"It's all inclusive, I can't wait to be drinking every night,\" then I asked her, \"Who's going to be watching your kids while you do all that?\" And she had the nerve to say my wife, without ever asking her about it. I'm glad my wife told her that she plans on creating core memories with her kids and she should do the same. But she continued to drop hints that she will try to pawn her kids on us. I told my wife I see this being a shit show, and we backed out of the vacation. Now we will be traveling alone, just the four of us, to a different location. OP I totally understand lol.", "You couldn't have told your dad in advanced because he didn't tell you in advanced that they were coming, NTA.", "NTA. Keep saying no to being your sister\u2019s unpaid nanny. Lock yourself in your room or leave to a friend\u2019s when they come over. Avoid them until they learn to respect you.", "NTA - you are definitely a boss. That is quick thinking! I'm so proud of you for seeing the situation and finding a solution that quickly!!! Pat yourself on the back. And yeah, Disney is so overrated.", "Thank your dad for his understanding and let him know that you would warn him if you had any warning yourself. If he makes sure you aren't surprised next time, then you'll let him in on your plan.", "Fuck no you're not at all.", "NTA. A celebration for you they said. Yet they lied and manipulated the situation so you would be baby sitting the entire time whilst everyone else has fun.\n\nYour family is sucky, wasting this money will hopefully make them realise that you're not free labour whenever they feel like it. I feel like you need to have a sit down with your parents though and really express how ridiculous they are. \n\nEnjoy your time alone! Glad the actual kids parents are having to put the work in and look after their own damn kids for once, like everyone else does.", "NTA Tell your dad you gave him as much warning as he gave you.", "NTA. Honestly I respect what you did, it was quick thinking, 'losing' your passport like that.", "NTA. Maybe you could have given your Dad a head\u2019s up if he had given *you* one first.", "Yeah. Reply with \" Oh, I'm sorry I ruined your vacation. If you had only let me know in advance that you didn't in fact plan this vacation as a celebration for my graduation like you told me but only wanted me there as your unpaid fulltime babysitter, I'd have made more of an effort to be there.\"\nNTA", "NTA this 100 percent! Call them out on this! This was definitely planned.\n\nWhen dad mentions knowing what you did and you should have warned him. Tell him strange things like this happen like your sister showing up on-a vacation for the three of you?\n\n\nStart saying no. Start having plans. Get a job when your sister show up volunteer to work a lot that week until you have money to move out.\n\nIf parents can\u2019t take care of the kids they have then don\u2019t have them.! Parents need to realize their siblings are not free nanny\u2019s. It isn\u2019t thier sibling\u2019s responsibility to offer any kind of child care.\n\nNo wonder siblings know longer want to be fun aunts and. Uncles because they are expected to be childcare on demand!", "Love this! Also what the hell is the point of taking kids to disneyland if you don't want to actually be with the kids? And 3 adults to 2 kids doesn't exactly sound impossible... NTA", "She clearly knew her sister was going beforehand and pulled this stunt last minute. The Dad said she should have let him know so he didn't waste money so that gives the impression she already knew the sister was going.", "Right! If dad had let OP know beforehand and helped with the ruse it would\u2019ve worked and he could\u2019ve not paid for her trip.", "My thoughts exactly, if this was a concern he should have brought it up ahead of time and not said \"just the three of us\". Don't spring changes on people at the last minute and be mad that they aren't okay with it. OP sounds like she is near parentified. I hope they take the hint. NTA.", "I'm wondering if the dad knew, was told by the mom that OP knew as well, and based on that info, he is upset she didn't say something earlier. But OP didn't know earlier, so she couldn't say anything but the dad doesn't know that.", "Exactly!", "Relationships are way more complicated than that.", "The trip was for the sister 100%.\n\nFor making honor role in high school one of my parents suggested going to dinner, and I was excited since this was for me I\u2019d get to pick where we go. Nope. Parent decided where we were going. Turns out my honor role was just an excuse to go to the restaurant they wanted.\n\nNTA, OP, and super quick thinking on your part!", "Good point", "Also, couldn\u2019t tell him because she only found out last minute\u2026 but dad wasn\u2019t surprised. Dad didn\u2019t step up before because dad doesn\u2019t care, he just doesn\u2019t want to look like the bad guy.", "Especially when it was him who was keeping it from her\u2026 because he wasn\u2019t surprised by the additions, and it was both of them that told her it was just the three of them.", "It could have happened if someone had told OP that her sis was coming along. Instead, they all tried to ambush her to go along as the babysitter under the guise of celebrating her graduation. If dad knew all this and didn't say anything, dad is bit of an AH too.", "It\u2019s hard to learn to set boundaries as a minor who\u2019s probably punished for trying to, particularly when those boundaries need to be against your parents. Parents have too much power over children. OP wouldn\u2019t be the AH for not having learned a challenging skill she was actively discouraged from practicing, regardless.", "NTA\n\nWhy should OP pay Dad back? He went along with the lie!", "No way on paying Dad back.  He should have shut this little scheme down before it started.  Fuck him.", "The unpaid nanny work she did should be sufficient. Not sure where OP is from but a quick Google shows nannys generally make anywhere between $18-$32 an hour or more.", "OP has already paid back the ticket in all the childcare they have provided over the years.", "Really? Dad sounds awesome? He is mad at OP for not telling him beforehand so the money wasn\u2019t wasted but OP didn\u2019t know. The parents straight up lied to OP saying that it would only be the two of them. Everyone but OP sucks. Dad just sucks a little less for understanding why OP did it.", "He doesn't sound awesome. He sounds like an asshole. It was on him to stand up for his daughter this whole time.", "How is the dad awesome? He needs to grow a spine", "Oh look such great quality time with the grandkiddos can\u2019t miss out on magical moments", "Noooo, if dad was \"awesome \"  he would have given OP a heads-up that sis and mom were planning this Disney ambush... NTA", "Yeah, not so much \"awesome\", as an enabler, & someone who want to not see the boat rocked.\n\nHe has seen how the older treats the younger, EVERY TIME(?) she visits. He cannot be so stupid or so unaware as to not know the younger **does not like it**.", "Missing info, did he know his married daughter plus kids were also going? Was this only a secret from op or also from the father?\n\nAlso, the fact Dad hadn't done anything for the previous slave labour speaks louder. He can not be that blind. Maybe he sympathise but needs peace in the house.\n\nThe family is terrible.", "I mean, he was in on the plan not to tell her the kids were coming, so how awesome is he?", "Dad is ok, he's awesome if he wasn't aware the sister and kids were coming before hand. Not awesome if he was aware and didn't say anything.", "Did dad know that sister was coming ahead of time, or was he just as surprised as OP? I suspect the former and that's not awesome. He allowed OP to be a free nanny upto this point too, not a good look on him.", "They done this many times. If dad really had OP's back why didnt he steped in before.\nNTA", "Her dad said he would have backed her in her plan, but she had to create the plan last minute, because her dad not only failed to tell her her sister was coming, but her parents outright lied to her when they told her it was just the three of them.\n\n\u201cOh I\u2019d have backed you up had you told me the plan I prevented you from making beforehand by not giving you any of the real information\u201d", "So awesome that he went along with this deception until she found a way to spike their wheels and has gone along with letting her be used like this to this point. She needs to keep her own counsel from any of these people permanently. They will never stop trying to use her.", "He's been letting this crap go on, he was in on the deception, he's not THAT awesome.", "To be fair they lied first and sprang the sister + kids coming right when they were already at the airport, so she'd have had very short notice to give that ultimatum anyway.", "Her parents were sneaky and dishonest. She just matched their energy.", "At the airport, seeing sister and niblings, after literally asking and being told they were not going to be on the trip?!", "They lied to her and they've been forcing her to babysit. She does NOT owe them anything.", "Teenage minor living under her parent's roof doesn't have a ton of leverage when older family members are united (or complacent) in using her like this.", "It would have cost him the exact same amount of money.", "Honestly, from the picture I get of mom and sister she actually chose the most drama free option by removing herself from the situation. Her trying to stick to her boundaries would have caused sooo much drama. All week long. I say good on OP.", "That's a really hard to thing to ask of a 17-year-old, and it wouldn't have worked. Her family would have guilt-tripped her, called her selfish, said \"oh we will be gone for just a minute!\", she would have had to say no to taking care of the kids in front of the kids which sucks, etc.", "It's not OP's fault the parents lied.", "They lied and schemed and failed to communicate too. At worst it's an ESH.", "Lying to get out of a situation your family lied to get you in (at 17) \u2026 I can\u2019t judge that very harshly.", "What\u2019s wrong with you? They lied to OP to coerce her into yet another unpaid babysitter gig. They wasted HER time, and their own money.", "On top of that screenshot the whole post after so when they take it down cuz you made them look bad you can repost it on your own!", "NTA. They tried to trick you into something unpleasant and it blew up in their faces. Maybe next time they won't lie to you to manipulate you into being their unpaid nanny.", "Adding to this: \"I have already put in [x] hours of babysitting services that were never paid. So the money my parents paid for my unused flight and entrance fee can be deducted from what I am owed.\"", "Dad should have warned op, of the ruse, they were trying to pull on her.", "Yeah, OP couldn't have warned their dad ahead of time because OP didn't know there was a problem until the sister showed up at the airport with her kids. OP thought fast and did the only thing they could, and I admire them for it.", "So true! I do wish we as a society helped parents more with childcare. It takes a village and all that. But the entitlement of OP's sister and some of these other parents is appalling. It's bad enough to just presume she is alway going to take care of kids so the grownups can talk but to hijack her graduation celebration like this? They're the worst.", "It was probably actually a treat for the sister's kids and they pretended to be giving OP a \"present.\"", "So OP says they were told it's just them and their parents, finds out otherwise at the airport and does some quick thinking.\n\nBut you think she clearly knew beforehand and that's why she pulled a stunt at the last minute? Are you kidding?", "That gives the impression the Dad is just searching for someone to blame and like hearing his own voice. That's it.\nOP even asked if it's just the 3 of them and it was confirmed.", "Most likely dad is not on her side, he just tries to avoid conflict (and wasting money).\n\nWhich also means he would gladly side with her mom if it meant less headache for him.\n\nOP shouldn't feel guilty for him at all.", "Not really, we like to give people a lot of forgiveness and second chances but considering how the dad has rolled over and let the family dynamic get this bad, he's going to avoid rocking the boat. And that will come at the expense of OP every single time\n\nEdit: Also, notice how he said he would play along with the lie, not that he would stand up for OP. He can stand up to his wife and tell her to cut it out at any moment, but he won't. Why would that change now?", "So he's supposed to just stay silent while his family takes advantage of his daughter? Complicated my ass, she deserves at least one person in her corner", "They're usually not, though. If someone, a parent no less, has a history of not having your back, they won't change when you're nearly or fully an adult.", "*Individual actions* are complicated to judge.\n\nThis is not about an individual action but something that became a pattern over a long time.\n\nAnd dad *never* did anything about it. What makes you think it would be different now?", "Dad is totally the asshole. He\u2019s talking out of both sides of his mouth.", "Exactly, consider the airfare, hotel, & park admission costs a very small price to pay for all that \"free\" child care the younger has provided for the older.", "Can\u2019t up vote this enough! All the adults were the a**holes", "Lots of people saying this, but we don't know what he's saying in private.\n\nMaybe he's telling his wife and elder daughter they shouldn't be using the youngest as a babysitter, but he doesn't want to start arguments when they're all together. Especially if youngest hasn't spoken up herself, it suddenly puts her in an awkward position.\n\nI'll bet they got no sympathy from him the entire time they were there.", "That's a good point! I didn't think about how he could have advocated for OP.", "And would have insisted she not be left in charge of the kids.", "You're right. I missed that part about the dad being part of the lie.", "If we\u2019re being real, dad could be one of those spouses that\u2019s told to pipe the hell down.

But he says I should have let him know so he didn't waste money. He said he would have gone along with my ruse.\n\nThis is BS, because he never warned her this was happening. He has also never confronted his wife and daughter about their abuse of the OP's time.", "Why would Dad say you should have told me so I didn't waste money?

Stupid games, stupid prizes.", "Did you notice that only the women, Mom and sister, complained about caring for the Kids? So it's the typical Story of women are default childcare. What I mean is, is OPs das really on her side or is it more like he doesn't care which women will take care of the Kids? Because, if he understood the whole dynamic, it's Kind of obviously that He never offered childcare to give OP a break on vacation. He was happy with this arrangement. Just now He gets a bit pissy because of money.", "Or the Dad is an enabler. \"Oh if you had only told me, I would've supported you,\" but has watched this play out several times before, most likely knew the sister was coming and it would happen again, and didn't warn her.

He went with the moms ruse when he knows how OP feels, and also says he would have gone along with OPs ruse if he knew she didn't want to go.

That is much more likely than whatever conspiracy you have playing out in your head.", "No, her story doesn't. She quite clearly said she found out at the airport.", "Maybe there's a good reason why he hasn't been babysitting, we don't have the information one way or the other. I'm just presenting another interpretation.\n\nAnd I'm sure you'd be calling Dad an asshole if he said to them \"Well OP feels like this...\", throwing her under the bus in front of Mom and Sister.", "It's not about hiding it, it's about not speaking for OP, or forcing her into conversations she may not be ready to have.", "I'm not claiming he's a hero, he's obviously not.\n\nBut unless OP advocates for herself in these situations, he couldn't solve the problem himself.\n\nMaybe his comments about the ruse are a way of saying \"If you stand up for yourself, I'll back you\". It's another interpretation of the facts we're presented with.", "We can def agree to disagree", "Might have been park tickets.", "Idk this is a 17 year old we are talking about. Her sister just pops up at he airport with her entire family? I don't believe that part."]}
