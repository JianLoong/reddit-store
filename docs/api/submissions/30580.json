My niece, \"Pink\" is a beautiful playful and curious little girl who loves to touch and examine everything she comes into contact with. Her curiosity follows her everywhere. But Green, would bring her to my house every now and then and instead of stopping her from touching things like my glass coasters, she would just leave Pink to her own devices. I would step in to redirect Pink. I'd turn her away from the object of interest, distract her with a cuddle or even sit on the floor and play with her - heavily pregnant or postpartum and recovering from an episiotomy, rinse and repeat, I've done both.\n\nWhen I brought the fact up with my sister she told me to baby-proof my house. I told her no, and stayed firm on my answer. So she decided to stop coming over to my house all together to visit my newborn and I and suggested I come to her house for every visit because her house is already baby-proofed. I told her no, because I didn't want to be the only one going to and from every time. I have told her that all I want is for her to keep an eye on Pink when she comes to my house. My whole family hate me now. AITAH?\n\nEDIT: People have been double checking. Yes, I am baby-proofing my home when it's necessary for my daughter. To elaborate, when Green asked me to baby-proof my home it was for Pink's 20 minute visits once every fortnight and my baby was still in my womb at that point. Pink has never been with me when her Mum wasn't there. She's never stayed at mine and I've never been asked to babysit, otherwise I would've seen it necessary to baby-proof for my niece. I was asked to baby-proof my house for Pink.\n\nAnd I used the glass coasters as an example, there's also a 50 inch TV on a TV unit in my livingroom, etc. Regardless, Pink never stayed in just one room, but even when she went to explore Green wouldn't follow. I did.\n\nEdit 2: The frequency of the visits between us does not matter to me. I would happily visit once a month or even less if need be. Though, I would prefer for the responsibility of the visits to be rotated between us. eg. I visit her, she visits me and so on. Green wants weekly or fortnightly visits with the responsibility being solely mine to come to her, and never her to me.", "created_utc": 1699458696, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17qola4/aitah_for_asking_my_sister_to_keep_an_eye_on_her/", "score": 215, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And I was heavily pregnant during one of those visits, and during the rest of them I was postpartum and recovering from an episiotomy. After about 2 months she stopped coming. I was still postpartum when all of this was happening and through most of it was in serious pain from having my privates cut open. And I should've taken responsibility for another person's child despite all that? I had to take sole responsibility of Pink all of those times - at that visit 2 weeks before my due date, and the other 2-3 times after having my daughter.\n\nI don't want a reason to be angry at anyone, I don't think it's fair to expect a heavily pregnant or in-postpartum woman with stitches in her privates to look after your toddler just so you don't have to.

As someone with two young children (5M and 2F), I can tell you how rapidly of a moving target babyproofing is, so if you're able to get some advance practice, it'd be a shame not to take advantage of it.\n\nEdit: Changed NAH to NTA, because your sister absolutely should be watching her own child, babyproofed house or not, as every child requires a different level of babyproofing.", "She can complain but that doesn\u2019t mean that guilt have to do anything about it", "If you look at OP's post history ... while she's claiming her baby is 2-3 months here, her due date was also a week in the future 7 months ago.", "Not to mention that babies have secretly expandable arms.

She is a climber.\nI've seen and read many stories like that which is why it shocked me that Green never prevented or stopped my niece from touching the TV, she just let her.", "As your niece gets more active, and you refuse to babyproof, there will be no point in your sister coming to see you. She would spend every minute there trailing her daughter, not getting to see you or your kid. So why would she come to you when you won't help her out?", "But it is their choice to not want to come for visit to a place where they will have to spend all 5heir time watching the child like a hawk. Such visits are very tiring and pointless. One do not even get a conversation or socialization out of it.\n\nGoing to a place where toddler can easily destroy things if you loose attention for 20 seconds is, frankly, not smart.", "Is there more to this? Do you and your sister not get along? Because most people, IME, would be happy to do this small thing for their sister and niece.", "Honestly at this point, this seems like a rage bait post. A child free person, changing details to now have a baby to seem more empathetic. The baby proofing topic is huge on TikTok right now. \nHer staying only 20 minutes every fortnight really sealed it for me. I don\u2019t know one mother of a toddler who packs up their little hellion to go to a house where they\u2019ve got breakable items and no baby proofing for 20 minutes, to have no conversation really because someone has to be chasing the kid around and the person there refuses to baby proof, yet also has a child on the way so will need to eventually do it anyway? It seems so set up to get everyone to shit on toddler moms. \nAnd if on some wild shit, this is actually true, I\u2019d bet that you\u2019re actually child free or you just hate your sister. Because this seems like the absolute stupidest hill to die on, and lose a relationship over. Especially if you love your niece & sister. ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A BABY AND ARE GOING TO NEED TO DO IT ANYWAY. Wanting to do it only when your baby needs it but also wanting your toddler niece to visit seems so counterproductive. If this is real, I can\u2019t wait for the reality to set in when you have toddler and no one around you is empathetic to that. Your sister is also a person, and she was her own person before she was a mom, so her wanting some relaxing time at a house she thought she could deem safe, with safe people- is not her being a bad parent. It\u2019s her being an exhausted one. \n\n\nBut like I said, I really think this is rage bait- or at the very least details about OP have changed to make her seem more empathetic.", "I feel as if you're now adding more details to make this more severe than it actually is. If you were already visiting her and she's only been over a few times then it's no real loss if she stops coming. She doesn't want to lug her toddler to a home that's unsafe for her toddler especially if since you seem to think her 20 minute visits where she wants some adult time, you're basically calling her a bad parent. \nI don't agree that you should be in charge, especially heavily pregnant and pp, but she gave you a solution, you didn't want to do it (which is your right) so now she's made the decision not to come over. Simple. If you don't want to go over to her, don't. Simple. This isn't the case of anyone being an AH, it just seems like you two don't mesh. And maybe when you are in similar stages with your children, you'll connect more. Because, as a mom of three, I can 100% confirm that pregnancy and pp are worlds easier than the toddler stage. And until you're in it, you can't understand. I have empathy for where you're both at in your motherhood journey but it just seems like you two probably don't like each other as friends and just don't mesh.", "The very first thing I said was that asking her to watch her child was reasonable.  It's also reasonable that if you care about the safety of your own child you would also care about the safety of your niece.  You are drawing lines in the sand here that are going to come back to bite you.", "That's fair, thank you!", "It's scary how often people think something bad won't happen to them or their child. Almost every parent who lost a child to an accident like this thought it wouldn't happen to them or that it wasn't possible. They forget what it was like to be a curious child, we all did stupid things at some point not realizing how dangerous it was and kids this age have no sense of self preservation, they don't understand what danger is.", "I was heavily pregnant, and then I was postpartum, and recovering from having my privates sliced open, and despite all that I was expected to keep an eye on a child that isn't mine so that her own mum didn't have to keep an eye on her for 20 minutes whilst she and her daughter were guests in my house. And I'm setting a selfish precedent?\n\nThank you for your input. But if you're taking your own child to another person's house isn't it your own responsibility to take care of your own child whilst you're there, instead of deciding its a vacation and making your child someone else's responsibility - someone who you didn't even ask to take responsibility of your child. Instead you just sit back, relax, and let it happen until the host steps in.\n\nI can't wrap my head around that.\n\nI live in the top half of a two story house. Green stayed in the livingroom whilst her baby ran out and into the hallway where there is a concrete staircase. She could've fallen had I not been there. My baby was just born, she wasn't getting anywhere, I wasn't even 24 hours from having given birth.", "I've no problem with helping her out if she asks. The problem is that she doesn't ask for help, and nevertheless, I'm not helping her, I'm doing everything whilst she does nothing.", "Okay, thank you for your opinion \ud83d\ude0a", "That's completely fair. I never expected regular visits by any means, my sister did. Only, she expected me to take 100% of the visiting responsibilities after I asked her to keep an eye on her baby when she was over at my house - it's as if she doesn't want to take responsibility of her own child if someone else can do it. And I use the words \"can do it\" very loosely, being postpartum/episiotomy and all that.", "Have you guys looked at other options like putting her in a play pen with toys or staying in one baby proofed room and closing the door to the rest of the house? How about a park?", "To find friends?", "Dear me.  We've all done this.  We've all had babies and episiotomies.  My mother in law had 12 babies.  Who do you think looked after them each time she had a new one?  She did.  Who will look after this one after you've given birth to the next one?  You will. \n\nI don't know what in the world makes it so hard to put a few things up so that a child doesn't get hurt.  Also, maybe say yo, bro, your kid is over there, please get her back and watch her until I have a chance to make this house safe for her.  \n\nThis isn't just someone bringing their child to your house, it's your sister and your niece.  I can't wrap my head around that.\n\nOf course your sister should watch her child.  And so should you.  Because you're her aunt.", "Cause I've no friends to ask, only family and they all think I'm an AH.", "Sounds like it\u2019s time to broaden your friend group. It\u2019s likely that your family is taking your sisters side because they are tired of the bitching", "I don't think so.

You\u2019re just selfish.", "NTA\n\nWe didn't really baby proof the house when my nephew was born. So what big baby proofing is she expecting?", "NAH. The thing is, as a parent of a toddler, when you go over to someone's un-baby-proofed house, your mind becomes absorbed with \"what are they going to touch?\", \"are they going to break anything?\". And it requires a whole lot of getting up and chasing them around. It takes a lot of mental energy to do this. It's super hard to focus on a conversation with another person. \n\nPerhaps you could alternate going over to each other's place? You could baby-proof a little bit so when your sister comes it's not as stressful for both of you.", "NTA", "NTA. This is not about baby proofing. This is about your sister not watching her own child in someone else's house.

My SIL has had her mom babysit countless times and we only ever baby proofed the house for the pup we had. \n\nBecause we kept an eye on the babe entirely or trusted the kids to keep to their own in the same room. \n\nMy SIL isn\u2019t even proofing their new home for their 1year old and he had a fixation on stairs for MONTHS, she just keeps an eye on him and same when she visits others. Is it so hard and bad to expect mothers to mind their kids?", "I personally find the idea of baby proofing a home to be absurd.  While one should not have knives and such lying about, the idea that you must make your home such that everything in it is unbreakable and available for a kid to touch/handle/toss around is the symptom of lazy parenting.  Decorate as you wish, but if your sister wishes to avoid your home because it isn't kid/baby proof, that is her choice and somewhat reasonable.", "When you bring you child to someone else's house, you supervise your child.  \n\nEven if OP's house were perfectly baby-proofed, no responsible parent allows an 18 month old child to run around at will without supervision anywhere.  What, are you going to babyproof your chairs so a child can't climb up and jump off?  \n\nAlso, Green's expectations are unreasonable. Are your supposed to make sure that every drawer in your house, every cabinet, the top and bottom of every stair, every breakable ornament, every choke-sized object is going to be baby-proofed when you, yourself, don't have a small child?\n\nNope\n\nNTA.   Here's hoping Pink survives the many houses she'll be in that aren't perfectly babyproofed, and even the ones that are perfectly babyproofed, given that her mom walks through the front door and takes a vacation from responsible parenting.", "Look, my son is 15 years old now, but I only ever did \u201cmild\u201d baby proofing when he was a child. By that I mean I covered electric sockets, and made it so doors couldn\u2019t be opened etc. There is no substitute for paying attention to what your child is doing, and making sure their room is designed for them.  Playpens etc can go to other peoples homes, and frankly, I paid attention to what my son was doing if we were not at home. I have no idea if anyone\u2019s house that I went to was baby proofed. I knew exactly where my baby was the whole time. NTA", " NTA.  Who doesn\u2019t watch their child when they are in a strange environment.  This entitlement of expecting everyone to cater to her is annoying.", "NTA Just cut the visits.  We are unable to baby proof our home (medications, medical paraphernalia).

I stopped visiting friends like OP who left breakables in reach of toddlers because it was too stressful trying to split my attention between listening to them and watching my kid like a hawk. You can't win. You are either the bad friend because your attention is clearly elsewhere (ie your child) or you are a bad parent because your child is into everything. YTA for refusing any sort of inconvenience or compromise. You could offer to meet at a playground or a cafe with a play area if you don't want to childproof your house.
