My niece, \"Pink\" is a beautiful playful and curious little girl who loves to touch and examine everything she comes into contact with. Her curiosity follows her everywhere. But Green, would bring her to my house every now and then and instead of stopping her from touching things like my glass coasters, she would just leave Pink to her own devices. I would step in to redirect Pink. I'd turn her away from the object of interest, distract her with a cuddle or even sit on the floor and play with her - heavily pregnant or postpartum and recovering from an episiotomy, rinse and repeat, I've done both.\n\nWhen I brought the fact up with my sister she told me to baby-proof my house. I told her no, and stayed firm on my answer. So she decided to stop coming over to my house all together to visit my newborn and I and suggested I come to her house for every visit because her house is already baby-proofed. I told her no, because I didn't want to be the only one going to and from every time. I have told her that all I want is for her to keep an eye on Pink when she comes to my house. My whole family hate me now. AITAH?\n\nEDIT: People have been double checking. Yes, I am baby-proofing my home when it's necessary for my daughter. To elaborate, when Green asked me to baby-proof my home it was for Pink's 20 minute visits once every fortnight and my baby was still in my womb at that point. Pink has never been with me when her Mum wasn't there. She's never stayed at mine and I've never been asked to babysit, otherwise I would've seen it necessary to baby-proof for my niece. I was asked to baby-proof my house for Pink.\n\nAnd I used the glass coasters as an example, there's also a 50 inch TV on a TV unit in my livingroom, etc. Regardless, Pink never stayed in just one room, but even when she went to explore Green wouldn't follow.

And you may find them not as curious as your niece. Less likely to get into things. You baby proof according to your child\u2019s needs.

Having Pink and Green over would be exhausting. \n\nBaby-proofed or not, a parent (or some other trustworthy person) needs to keep a close eye on their toddler at all times, especially in a strange home. It is not fair of your sister to expect you to watch her kid every time she visits. \n\nHowever, you may as well start packing away the breakables now, you are going to need to soon enough and you want it done before they grab something for the first time.

Making sure the child is safe is a different level of watching than making sure there are no fingerprints on the TV.

Sounds like a bad idea to wait until she's already moving", "Watching an active and mobile young child when you're trying to visit another adult is stressful when it's not in a safe space.  Your sister is within her rights to not want to come visit you in your place in that circumstance.  \n\nYou're not wrong for refusing to baby proof or expect your sister to watch her kid.  But you became one for continuing to demand that she come visit on your terms after that refusal. She offered a compromise that you shot down.", "That still doesn't really make sense. Baby proofing for one child would work for another. Your baby is very young right now so maybe you don't have much to do, but in like a year it'll be the same kind of baby proofing for both kids. Is it possible for you guys to just meet in the middle somewhere if just your houses are no good to meet in?", "It sounds as if your sister has been going to your house every time? So why would you not be able to go to hers until you\u2019ve deemed it appropriate to child proof your own house? It sounds as if you just want to be upset with your sister. You demand visits be at your house but do nothing to make those visits easier on your sister or her child. If she has to spend the whole visit wrangling her kid at a home that not baby proofed and she doesn\u2019t get the adult time she\u2019s probably craving, what\u2019s the point in going. \nMaybe when your child is older and people start demanding you bring a toddler to their home but have done no prep for that toddler and you spend the entire time stressing over them, not including the mass amount of effort it takes just to get them out of the house, you\u2019ll understand it\u2019s just not worth the effort to pack up and make those visits. I think time will you give you empathy. Your sister probably just really wants to feel like her own person and not just a mother and she figured her sisters house would be a safe space for that. But she was wrong.", "Every other time would be fine, but I guess I also don't get why you're so adamant about not baby proofing.  You have to do it for your own anyway, how does Pink not rate the same care?

That's why I refused. My family wanted me to go to them and only me to them every week cause they weren't coming to my house.", "Baby-proofed or not, shouldn't she still have to keep an eye on her own child? She can't expect every house she ever visits to be baby-proofed for her arrival? And she can't expect a heavily pregnant woman to watch her child cause its too stressful for her to do it? Or a woman who's just had an episiotomy? Or a woman that has a newborn baby to care for?\n\nAm I really being unreasonable?", "It sounds like both you and your sister need to find other friends who are not family members.", "Right.  Because you're sticking to your guns on not baby proofing. \n\nYou want to not babyproof.  Your sister doesn't want to kid wrangle in that environment. Her compromise respects your desire to keep your house how you damn well please *and* your desire to not have her kid running amok in it. Your continued demand that she keep coming to your space is not respecting her desire to not have to deal with how you want to keep your house.\n\nIt's a weird hill to die on since your own kid is about to start crawling so you're going to have to soon anyway.

You cannot expect every house to be baby-proofed but we didn't visit those that weren't often.  Visiting the grand-parents was always a short/stressful visit because we had to either leave the child in only the pack-n-play or follow them like the hawk.  We didn't visit often.  We visited my cousins all of the time because her kids were about the same age and we could trust that nothing was very dangerous/fragile in the play room.", "You are correct, that's exactly why I came here \ud83d\ude02", "I suspect you are both going to find that other moms with similarly aged kids are going to be better fits. Your sister will find that other moms with 18+ month old toddlers have properly baby-proofed and allow for some age-appropriate unsupervised exploration; you will find that other moms with infants are still more hovering."]}
