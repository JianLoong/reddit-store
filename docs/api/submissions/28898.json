{"id": 28898, "submission_id": "177p92x", "title": "AITA for abruptly leaving a night out after being berated by my wife in public?", "selftext": "My wife (27f) and I (29m) had my wife's brother (29m) and his partner (29f) over for lunch as a light housewarming and an evening of drinking in our new area. I was drinking less than the group as I had work to do the next day (still had a few beers though). We historically all get along. There has been one other time where I left a night out after my wife had a go at me, and where her brother and partner were in attendance.\n\nThe evening was going well. It was getting cold so the group made the joint decision to move inside. The bar was busy, so I said I'd go in to check and make sure we could get a table without losing our current one. When I went inside, there was one table free (not enough space), but the bloke sitting on the one next to it said he was leaving in 5 mins. I sat at the free table and messaged the others that I had one.\n\nAs soon as they saw the table my wife and her brother complained about the spot and were frustrated that we had lost our old table. I explained to them that the bloke sitting next to us was about to leave and that both tables were ours in 5 mins. Her brother immediately went to look for another table. During his search my wife started having a go at me asking why I chose said table. She was pretty drunk at this point, and beyond explaining that there were no other tables when I looked, I basically ignored her. She then started to berate me, and yelled \"fucking listen to me\", or something close to that effect. This occurred in the middle of the bar. I felt both embarrassed and angry for being yelled at in public. I told her that \"I'm not putting up with this\", left the venue, and walked home.\n\nAll three of them tried to call me, but I ignored their calls. Once I got home I messaged her brother and sister-in-law to apologise for leaving, but explained that I was very frustrated with my wife, and that I would not be returning. They let it be. When my wife arrived home she continued to berate me. This angered me more, but I felt she was too drunk to reason with and so told her to go to bed. She eventually stormed off. The next morning I told my wife that she was out of line on the night. She said that she only had a vague recollection of the previous night, but based on my recap agreed and was very apologetic.\n\nI also woke up to a message from my wife's brother (sent the night before). He said that he thought my behaviour was poor (he was absent during the actual event and my leaving). Having been yelled at, I felt justified in leaving. I felt like his judgement was both unfair and unnecessary. Taking his perspective, I have done this twice, but both times were in response to my wife berating me when drunk. I don't really know how to move forward with my wife's brother, but I feel as though I'm owed some kind of apology from him.\n\nAm I the asshole for\n\nAbruptly leaving the night out?\n\nFeeling defensive in response to my wife's brother's message and wanting some kind of apology for calling my behaviour poor?", "created_utc": 1697289099, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/177p92x/aita_for_abruptly_leaving_a_night_out_after_being/", "score": 1335, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Best thing to do is detach yourself from the situation and stay out of the line of fire, don't allow yourself to be a target against someone who can't control themselves.

You're never the a-hole for leaving such a shitty situation. Why should you endure verbal abuse? \n\nI absolutely despise people who do that when drunk. It's never an excuse.

It is very reasonable to have a boundary that you will leave if some starts to shout at you. I wouldn't think too much about your BIL.

No-one wants to witness this sort of behaviour on a night out or be the recipient. If you had stayed I bet she would have continued berating you and causing a scene.

However, he lost that possibility when he went off to look for a different table rather than stand up to his sister.\n\nYour wife needs to take control of herself.

First, the problem is not tables or where you sat. But, I'll get to that in a moment.\n\nYour BIL wasn't aware of the circumstances under which you left.

Her husband is responsible for telling his views. \n\nYou could have let them know know you leaving before you left the bar. You knew they would be coming back to the area around the table, you could have located one of them or stood where you could see the table and approach them when they started toward the table. \n\nNow, as for the REAL problem. Your wife. You said this is not first time you left because of her behavior after drinking (too much). Sounds like she has a problem with gauging when to stop. It also sounds likes YOU are fully aware this. So, the question then becomes, WHY would you even go to place where she is in a position to drink that much? Why didn't you try to stop her from drinking enough to be drunk? And finally, why would you leave your clearly intoxicated wife sitting at table ALONE in a bar, and expect your BIL and SIL to take care of her?\n\nWhile she had no business biting your head off, you were very much responsible for everything that happened beyond that point and partially responsible for her getting that drunk to start with.

I get that you left because your wife were being disrespectul and she shouldn't drink much if she can't control her attitude, but to her brother it may seem like you are the type of man to abandon his sister drunk leaving her to her own luck. I know it isn't the case as you were probably sure her brother would take cake of her, but just as you couldn't stand her he could also feel the same and this is overall not the best solution. \n\nAlso, your brother in law could've just say something to you about his concern instead of just judging.

Stop drinking.", "Well maybe the ahole, you realize you knew you were going to be the only sober one and your wife is a mean drunk. What did you expect. First this habit of your wife going off on you tells you she thinks very little of you, she so easily goes off on you in public to embarrass you. Drinking to get drunk and not social seems to run in the family since the brother had to get his 2 cents in.

They're how I made a living.", "The thing is that OP isn't even concerned about her behavior, he is asking if he's TAH because he wants **her brother** to apologize. **NOBODY IS ACTUALLY ADDRESSING WHAT OP ASKED FOR**.", "Attention is attention even if it's negative, isn't it?  \n\n\nedit - removed my explanation of my comment", "Alcohol Use Disorder is a spectrum. Still have AUD when it\u2019s just that every time you do drink - which may be weeks in between - you over drink. \n\nLots of \u2018common\u2019 college behavior is AUD, it just never progresses any further and then becomes a non-problem\nIn that persons life.", "As I said in my last comment, as a recovering alcoholic with 16.5 years of sobriety who was a daily blackout drink for at least 3 years, I know EXACTLY what I'm talking about. Being an alcoholic isn't about how much or how often you drink. A baseline definition would be \"has little control over when they drink and, once they start, they're unable to stop.\"\n\nAnd there's no reason to be rude.", "You worked in a bar and seem to drink a lot, you are not a good source on alcoholics.", ">  Alcoholics don't do that.\n\nHell yes they do. Many alcoholics apologize constantly, for everything. \"I'm sorry\" might be their single most used phrase.", "Mom is a binge drinker and I grew up in dive bars until I became a bartender myself. These people truly do not know what someone with an actual alcohol problem looks like. A couple things that I think are - she's getting too drunk when she's with the people she feels safest with, which is SUPER important. People drink heavier when they know they are with safe people. The second thing is that she may not remember, but she still apologized immediately to OP with no argument. Lastly, the actual issue OP wanted to address was him wanting an apology from **wife's brother**! Wife doesn't control her brother. He's a grown ass man.", "it does point to the strong possibility of her being an asshole, though.", "It wasn\u2019t twice \u201dever\u201d, it was twice just with BIL at attendance.  Sounds like a problem to me.", "You are clearly raging from all this, I just thought it was messed up that you were making things up to blame OP. \n\n\nThat's it. Not complicated. Not a conspiracy or thought out plan or anything. \n\n\nI'm not mad either, just annoyed now considering it's like every response you just make up more complicated victimizing narratives."]}
