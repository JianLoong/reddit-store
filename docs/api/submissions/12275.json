My parents did not know any english so the whole application process is done by me and a math teacher. They were really unhappy about me leaving China but gave consent, and they paid for the school, which is 20000$ yearly and a boarding school, and told me I need to come back. There was one relative taking care of me there. Our family is pretty well off since my dad and mom is both graduates from the Beijing University, the best university in China. Their job roughly have 10000$ per month pay. However, I've gone to college at US and moved to Iceland, which was a very complicated process and took me 9 months. My parents was very unhappy about it, however, and asked me to come back\n\nI told them that I will be staying in Iceland since it is a really good place, and that I am really sorry I cannot come back, and that I will help them(my parents only, specifically mentioned not my brother who bullied me) if they have issues, and things did not escalate that much.\n\nNow my brother's wife had a baby and then she died from the birth, and my parents is asking me to come back to china since my brother is broke. I told them it could only be 3 months at most, since, even though my boss is VERY lenient, he still got a company to manage. They said it is a long term job. I politely declined, telling my parents that I am settled in Iceland and I will not be coming back too long. I told them that they can give financial aid to my brother, and that I could also give it. They declined to give financial aid for whatever reason, and I still gave 1000$. The parents then accused me of \"betraying\" china and the family, and all of my family except my uncle is shutting me out and accusing me of being selfish. They are saying I am richer than most of my family and I don't even have a wife and that I am selfish and a liar, which is true, so am I being selfish? And am I being an AH by lying that \"I will come back\"?\n\nBTW non native english speaker here pls don't be the trolls who says \"you're wrong cuz you forgot a comma\"", "created_utc": 1678789423, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11r2hm7/aita_for_not_helping_my_brother_babysit/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Be selfish.  You need to care for yourself.  If you go back to China, I\u2019m afraid you will never leave.", "Try considering shame as a tool. They're using shame as a tool against you. \n\nTurn the tables on them. Use shame as a tool on them. \n\n\"You are right there, why are you not helping brother? You are his parents, why can't you be good parents to him? Why are you not helping your struggling child in his time of need? You certainly can afford to hire help for him\" and then just pile on and on. Don't even respond when they ask you to come home, just dive straight into shaming them for not helping him.  Teach them that they will receive nothing but shame from you when they go this route. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s very sad for your brother, but he isn\u2019t alone - he has them to help raise his baby while she\u2019s small. Maybe also his wife\u2019s family.  Even if he was alone, you would do better to send him whatever money you could afford without making your own life harder rather than wrecking your career and your chance to stay in Iceland.\n\nHow did you end up going to the US in 6 grade alone? Were you staying with a relative? It seems like you must have a fairly extended family; maybe some of them could help your brother financially too - spread the burden. Your parents aren\u2019t reacting to this situation with their brains, just their feelings.", "Oof, the cultural differences are huge here.\nYou still are NTA and I can see why they are upset you said you would come back and didn\u2019t. However, circumstances change, and when you said you would you come back, you were likely in a different circumstance. They had to have known you were moving to Iceland? Especially if it took 9 months for the process. \n\nRegardless, despite the fact that your brother has experienced a tragedy - it isn\u2019t your responsibility to take care of his child full time. Offering to come back for *up to 3 months* was generous, and that would have given him time to figure something else out, but again, it isn\u2019t your responsibility. And I don\u2019t think the fact that they paid for your tuition while you were in America makes a difference unless they were clear that you were essentially indebted to them for the rest of your life once you were done with school. Which is ridiculous even if they did.", "NTA Neighbor. You have a right to your life and to make decisions about it. I'm sorry for your brother's loss but his child is not your responsibility. You sent money for child care and your parents should be doing the same if they're really that concerned.", "I mean $10k is like \u00a570k and that\u2019s a pretty comfortable salary even in Shanghai or Beijing, especially if they already own their homes and have no mortgage. \n\nI don\u2019t want to make assumptions but are you the daughter by any chance? And does your parents just want you to raise your brother\u2019s child so he could go have a career and get remarried without having to take care of his kid?", "NTA\n\nYou did mention your brother bullied you, I do feel bad for him but I guess you could call it karma.", "NTA! You need to take care of YOU! They made their choices! I\u2019m sorry his wife passed but that\u2019s not your issue to take care of.", "NTA.  Your family cut you off so you are now free from their manipulation and guilt tripping,  enjoy your life free from those users and leeches.", "NTA\n\nYou are free to do what you want. Don't mind your brother. It will eventually go away", "NTA- I think you going to help your brother for 3 months as well as giving him $1000 is extremely kind and something not a lot of people would do. I think it is hypocritical that your parents expect you to help when they aren\u2019t helping. They are his parents not you.", "NTA", "NTA. You've built a life for yourself and you're helping out in a way that you can despite the fact that your brother bullied you. Your family will be fine. Let your life lead where it will.", "NTA but did your parents prioritize your brother over you during your childhood??", "NTA. Wow you betrayed all of China. That is quite the accomplishment.  Lol. Seriously though. As the eldest son , you know they will ask you of this over and over. They have afforded you a life most never will have but that doesn\u2019t mean you owe them your life.  You\u2019re not a bad son for not coming back to China. You made a good life.  You also have to know they will probably never forgive you for not coming home and doing as they want because you ARE the eldest child. You know they want you to obey. You are breaking free from cultural ways and as the first to do so, you are walking a very lonely and difficult path. It doesn\u2019t make you wrong though. It makes you strong and independent.  Something you will never be in China under your parents thumb. Enjoy your life.", "NTA  If you intended to go back when you made that statement then you are not a liar, however as you got older and understood where the opportunities lie in your chosen field then your thoughts about going back also changed, this does not make you a liar.  If you go back even for 3 months they will try to make it as difficult as they can for you to leave again. They raised you, they know what to say to get you to do what they want. In this instance it seems they want to pass responsibility for your brothers family onto you when they refuse to take responsibility themselves.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That makes no sense.  What do other single parents do in China?  can't your father quit work and mind the baby?

Then, leave copies with your uncle, or someone that can overnight them to you from home (Iceland), AND TAKE A COPY WITH YOU and give them to a friend or put them in a safe place during your stay like a safety deposit box or other secure location in China...sometimes parents who feel their ADULT children have an OBLIGATION to care for family will do CRAZY THINGS to PREVENT THAT PERSON FROM LEAVING AGAIN. I'd hate to see you get stuck in China due to \"lost\" travel documents. Especially since you have a great life in Iceland.", "You can't be held accountable for promises you made (maybe?  did you actually promise to return permanently to China or did your folks just tell you you had to?) while aged 11ish.

You get to decide what you want to do with your life.", "NTA I am concerned that they will prevent you from leaving China even if your plan is only to visit short term.

Immigrating to another country doesn\u2019t make you a traitor to your birth country. Your brother is an adult and a parent and lives half the world rod away; you are giving him what you reasonably can offer.\n\nIt\u2019s weird that your parents won\u2019t help him financially- maybe their income has dropped and they don\u2019t want to admit it?

You offered monetary help. They just want you back home under their thumb. Your brother will and can figure it out.", "I would offer financial assistance, but not return even for three months. There will be immense pressure brought to bear on you to stay, perhaps even via the authorities to the point that you cannot leave again. Any financial assistance you are prepared to give should fulfil your \"duty\" (such as your family may perceive it), and discharge any \"guilt\" you may feel. There are many childcare options available in China, and babysitting sure does not require an IT professional.\n\nI left my own country for an exchange year at university, met my husband and never returned. We make our lives where we find them. Enjoy yours - Iceland is an amazing place!"]}
