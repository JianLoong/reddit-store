This isn't something she can control. \n\nAs time goes on, she will continue to need more care that is likely more than you are able to provide. You need to have a conversation with your parents about how you aren't qualified to be taking care of her at this stage, and you are uncomfortable with it.", "NAH \n\nDude caregiving is really fucking hard and taxing. Don't feel bad for how you feel. It's not easy. Wondering if in home care (by a paid professional) would be a helpful compromise here?", "NTA. You are NOT a bad person for feeling worn out and frustrated!  Caring for someone who is disabled and dependent on others is not an easy job and it WILL wear you out.  Is your family able to financially provide some respite care for your grandmother so that all three of you can GET A BREAK?  \n\nIt seems like you ALL THREE are about bottomed out when it comes to caring for grandma.  It's really heartbreaking to watch a loved one slip deeper and deeper into the illnesses of their twilight years, no matter what those particular conditions are.  You are watching a once vibrant and active human slowly lose their independence and abilities, and they come to rely on the caregivers more and more.  \n\nCaregiver BURN OUT is A THING.  Your parents should definitely look into getting someone to come in and help.  Even if it's only once or twice a month, that could be the break that you all need to get out of the house and do something fun, or even just go rent a hotel room and sleep for 18 hours straight.  Even small things like a day here and there can be super helpful for the whole family, I understand that it may very well upset grandma, but you cannot allow her to dictate whether or not you and your parents need a break from caregiver burnout.  \n\nA GOOD home caregiver will put up with the patient's tantrums and can let the person have a fit and once they are done, they will go right on with their task of caring for them.  My daughter is a caregiver and she has to have nerves of steel with some of her charges because they get mad if the family takes a day off and will start yelling and being uncooperative.  They get all excited for a few minutes and when they finally calm down, she just barrels into the room and states \"I'm your caregiver today, your family needs to run errands (or some excuse). THIS is your schedule: meds at x time, meal at x time, tv at x time, walk after snack at x time...  The person may argue a little bit, but like i said a good caregiver knows when to use their steel, and when to use their soft, and the patients respond quite well once they realize the caregiver isn't going to argue or mess about.  \n\nGood luck OP.  I know you are really feeling overwhelmed right now, and that is totally normal.  I hope you can get the help you all need to get a break and feel a bit better.", "NAH caregiver burnout is very real and not the fault of anyone involved. Look into respite care.", "NTA.  Dementia is hard on everyone.  I'm surprised that your dad, who is trained to be a care giver, is arguing with his mom, although on second thought, these could very well be arguments that are unavoidable as he deals with issues regarding her health and safety.\n\nIt sounds like it's time for your grandmother to be placed somewhere other than home.  She may not be happy there, but she's not happy at home, either.  This isn't her fault - it's the dementia.  But the rest of you are allowed to have lives, as well.  Please don't feel like you are a bad grandchild for not wanting to deal with this 24 hours a day - you sound quite compassionate.", "NTA. This doesn't make you a bad grandchild. Your feelings are perfectly normal. Is her preference for living at *\\[your\\]* home the only obstacle to her being in a home with 24/7 professional care? There is a reason people train to be professional caretakers, and you are not trained to deal with this.", "NTA, caregiving is not easy at all. Maybe hiring a caregiver will ease everyone\u2019s stress and work load.", "NTA. Caretaking is grueling, lonely, unforgiving work. Please be kind to yourself. You should hear what some of my friends that are new mothers say about how much they hate themselves and their babies when they're deprived of sleep and exhausted. And they chose to be a caretaker of a helpless infant, you did not choose to be the caretaker of a helpless adult.\n\nI practically had to raise my own brother because of the choices my mother made, and it impacted my life in a lot of ways. The biggest is that I do not want to have kids because I already raised one. By foisting your grandmother on you, your parents are putting you in a situation where your empathy will eventually run dry and you will not have any left for them when they get older. Nobody is an endless font of selflessness. Especially when they do not choose the burdens placed upon them. \n\nPerhaps avoid going home as much as you can until she passes, and set up boundaries between you and your parents and your grandmother. It may be their decision not to put her in a home, but you had no say in that.", "Nta. You just need a break", "Dementia is frustrating. It\u2019s frustrating for the family and Uber. Frustrating for the person suffering from it. The person with dementia does develop fear because they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. They just know that they are changing and they know they are losing their mind. I have been through this with my grandmother and my mother. There is kind of good news and that is that they get to a point when they don\u2019t realize how much they have lost. If the family can adjust and learn to react by agreeing with the patient things will get easier. My Mom could talk about things from 30 years ago and we learned to nod along. Don\u2019t argue and everyone is happier. \n\nIt\u2019s not easy to cope. If the family has a hard time you should consult a memory care facility. Medicare and Medicaid will help manage the costs. Dementia is progressive, it won\u2019t get better.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour parents have decided to burn themselve out, instead of making rthe reasonable solution that would also be better for grandma: A carehome.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou should REFUSE to join them, you need to replenish your energy for the next semester.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
