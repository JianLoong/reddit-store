Her and her wife have been separated for a few months but, are still \"trying to sort out their differences.\"\n\nEvery year around March, the whole family holds a sort of Spring banquet. Due to their separation my uncle and her wife arrived, well, separately. My uncles wife arrived first with the kids. Not long after my uncle showed up. She was wearing a full face of makeup, and a dress. At first everyone thought it was some kind of joke and started laughing but, soon realized it wasn\u2019t. When we sat down for dinner she fully came out and said she identified as woman now. My uncles wife almost immediately burst into tears and left the room. Her eldest went after her while the rest of us stared at my uncle in shock.\n\nNow here\u2019s where it gets interesting. My uncle has expressed \u201cnot feeling like a man\u201d to some of the family (including me). It was why we pushed for her to get a divorce. When they got separated, we thought my uncle had finally told her, come to find out she did not.\n\nBack to the dinner table. My uncles wife and son had run out and the youngest was in hysterics. So, I lashed out. It wasn\u2019t the smartest thing to do looking back but, I told her she was a selfish piece of shit and if she thought anyone was proud, she\u2019d been snorting too much coke. She left immediately.\n\nA few days ago, my mother called me and and said I\u2019d taken it too far and that my uncle wasn\u2019t responding to anyone\u2019s calls or texts.\n\nI know I was a bit harsh but, it wasn\u2019t the right place or time to reveal that. Especially when she hadn\u2019t told her wife and kids. For everyone to know something like this was up, except for her, I honestly feel terrible for my uncles wife. \n\nThis is a 64 year old we\u2019re talking about, to come out that way after so long. I love my uncle. My uncle was the first person to teach me how to ride a bike, drive but this is just\u2026\n\nI think I could\u2019ve been more sensitive so, AITA.\n\nEdit: Seen a few comments about this so, I quickly wanna say, she said she was fine with using uncle/ dad etc but wanted to be referred to as she/her and her new name. Edit 2: This is not written the best but, her wife and kids didn\u2019t know.", "created_utc": 1680917777, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12f75iw/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_uncle_for_coming_out_as/", "score": 3650, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I agree with commentors who say you are never too old or young to come out. I agree with commentors who say that you do not get to dictate when others come out.  I hope it's not taken as transphobic when I say that I DO think that she had an obligation to give wife & children this information before coming out to the extended family. It's 42 years of marriage, 4 children. Many trans people chose not to have spouses and children even though they remained in the closet. It's literally in this case not just about her. Her immediate family, while they should be supportive, deserved the opportunity to process this without the involvement of the wider group.", "Info- Your story isn\u2019t clear.

But this is someone in their 60s! \n\nYes, maybe it was a bit harsh but the truth hurts sometimes.  Surely she didn't believe that her wife and kids would be happy to find out like this? All the best to your family", "NTA. I am a firm believer in telling people they fucking suck when they Fucking suck.", "NTA. It\u2019s unacceptable for her to blindside her wife and children like this in public.", "Nta that was the worst time and place they're selfish", "ESH. You should not have said that to her. You only made a difficult moment worse, but it seems like you know that. \n\nShe should have told her family privately, especially her children, who are going to need time to adjust to this. The public setting was not the way to go. \n\nIf you want to maintain a relationship with your uncle, call her or go out to lunch with her and try to mend fences.

I hate to say it but I\u2019m so sick of seeing stories of these couples who have a long marriage + children all for it to be used as a facade. ??

A heads up should have been given, s conversation had.  Totally handled inappropriately.", "ESH, clearly. Both you and your relative handled this poorly.\n\nI agree that her wife should not have been told so publicly.  But there were better ways for you to express that.\n\nObviously, she wanted to do the coming out all at once and get it over with. It's very stressful, so I can understand,  but not very considerate of her wife and kids. Also, the dramatic and confrontational approach made it more likely that people would respond badly.\n\nBut you really made the worst of the situation, and it's likely that she has interpreted your reaction in the worst possible way.\n\nFor someone who has been in the closet that long, coming out at all is pretty terrifying. And, it's not like there was some way to do it where her wife and kids wouldn't be upset.", "NTA\n\nThe way your uncle came out and transitioned was extremely hurtful and painful to her own family. This really reminds me of how Caitlyn Jenner came out and did not allow any of her family any opportunity to process the change.\n\nShe may have felt like a woman for decades; however, she lead her immediate family to believe otherwise. When she decided to come out she did not give any of her immediate family an opportunity to process it before demanding it be recognized and respected.\n\nWhen this happens to a family unit where the trans person has had a long term established relationship with their immediate family as one specific gender and identify, it is very important that the immediate family be given the opportunity (even briefly) to process the grief of knowing that person for who they always have known them as so that they can move forward and actively accept them for who they are now.\n\nWhen that grieving process is denied, nothing but hurt and painful feelings are the result.", "NTA it was incredibly messed up for your uncle to not address this with their wife before announcing in the company of others. I understand that it\u2019s hard to come out and probably more difficult the older you get because you become used to living in a way that isn\u2019t authentic to who you are. But the fact remains that the more people who will be directly and deeply affected by this change in your life, the more responsibility you have to be aware and sensitive to this. Just as your uncle wants people to be aware and sensitive to their situation, I imagine. His wife and kids deserved better. Coming out without giving them time to process in private was an asshole move on their part.", "NTA. Everyone was kinda blindsided and it was inappropriate for her to come out this way. She should've spoken to her wife first and let her have some time to process.", "NTA, you don\u2019t wait come out for that long, and having children, that\u2019s just wrong to do your partner", "Eh, NTA. Uncle was an egregious AH and you had an honest familial reaction. If the uncle wasn't trans and showed up with a new lover unannounced I wouldn't bat an eye at you calling her selfish, etc.\n\nYou definitely could have handled it better though, always best to keep a calm head. You seem like a younger member of the family. Given your uncle's age, an elder probably should have confronted her on her behavior. Probably in private.", "ESH\n\nSounds like your entire family needs a class in communication.", "NTA. Coming out as trans is difficult and I commend your uncle (aunt?) on owning her truth. But to do it like this, not give her ex and children a heads up, and do the entire family at once, was selfish and moronic.\n\nYour relative owes the rest of you an apology.\n\nOf course you owe her an apology yourself. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right.", "NTA", "NTA - no matter how hard it was for her to come out she should have given her family the dignity and respect of letting them know first. Look at the wife and kids\u2019 reactions. Her coming out isn\u2019t just about her anymore when she has a family to be responsible for.

Then again, the family's reaction to seeing her for the first time (laughter and disbelief) implies that this is a family who are either transphobic or very insular in their experiences. I don't think yelling on top of what reads like a spectacle of emotions was the right thing to do. Something needed to be said about OP's \"uncle's\" poor choice communicating with her kids but, in a private setting.\nESH", "NTA - there is a time and place to make such a life changing and serious revelation to our close loved ones. How did your uncle think your aunt would feel finding out about this hidden secret at a family reunion in front of everyone? Does your uncle not realize this revelation would shake your aunt\u2019s life and turn it upside down? Your uncle is acting as if coming out as trans would have no effect on your aunt. I have nothing against trans people, but I know that if my husband came out as trans, I would be devastated because the man that I love would not be who I thought he was. I would not want to find out in a public setting. I would want to have that discussion in private. Your aunt is grieving the loss of a husband. The loss of that person she thought she knew, and now realizes she doesn\u2019t - and after so many years, it would be difficult to process such a big change. What your uncle did was inconsiderate to your aunt.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty trashy way to let your spouse and kids know something so big.", "NTA.  but your uncle is.", "INFO. Why were the wife and children so upset? Were they upset because they had no clue, or were they upset because they wanted the uncle to remain in the closet? Most importantly, did you know the answer to this before you attacked the uncle in public?", "INFO so this wife finds out the man she's is separated with wants to be a woman, and so does his child, at dinner infront of everyone??", "ESH I think it\u2019s important to remember you don\u2019t get to dictate how someone comes out.

No. If anything it just made everything worse. \n\nYou didn\u2019t get to have a say in how your uncle comes out and the consequences of that were hers to face alone.

It didn\u2019t help anyone, and simply added tension to a fraught moment.\n\nYour Aunt also handled this incredibly badly. Not because her ex-wife was upset, I don\u2019t think anyone knows what kind of discussions have been had between the two of them, but definitely because it seems her children were blindsided.

I\u2019m trans too so I can totally understand where your uncle (probably should call her aunt) is coming from. Considering recent events it\u2019s pretty hard for people to come out as trans and when you consider that we\u2019ve only really gotten visibility and awareness recently it\u2019s very understandable why she came out so late. I regret not transitioning earlier but the fact remains: you\u2019re never too old or too young to transition. I\u2019m very concerned for her right now because it seems like she feels ostracised by her own family.\n\nI am also very concerned about some of the comments that seem to be too eager at using the wrong pronouns. A stark contrast to the love I got on another AITA thread.", "So, it was perhaps a misguided choice for her to come out to everyone at once instead of her kids and spouse first. We don't know her reasoning, there are many possibilities as to why she did that.   \nHowever, YTA 100%. Your reaction was extremely cruel and it's clear to me that you care far more about everyone else than her. Your post doesn't paint you as particularly remorseful. Most of your post is about how terrible this is for her wife. Aside from the lack of tact and trust, I don't see why she is so hysterically upset--for christ's sake, her partner is trans, not dead or cheating! Maybe her wife doesn't like or accept trans people, I mean, she seems awfully upset to be married to one.   \nPeople don't always know they are trans until they are older. People don't always accept themselves until after years of denial. People come out when they can. And coming out, especially to family, can be absolutely terrifying. Maybe she felt safer coming out in a group with certain supportive presences there. Maybe this was the only way she could bring herself to do it, or maybe it was a rash decision after a long time of anxious deliberation. Fear and stigma doesn't help us make good decisions.   \nAt any rate, she finally came out, showed who she really was, even got dolled up (which is even harder if you're new to it,) and what happened? Her family laughed at her, her spouse and kids freaked out, and you stepped in and told her \"she was a selfish piece of shit and if she thought anyone was proud, she\u2019d been snorting too much coke.\" \n\nAnd you're not even *worried* now that she's not answering anyone's efforts to contact her?", "Mesh( except the wife and kids. They should've been told first. Now imagine how the uncle's wife feels. You don't know how long your spouse felt that way. You don't know if your marriage is a lie. You don't know even know if the person you married is who they say they are/ if you were used as a cover.\n\nThe uncle is a jerk because they shouldn't have done it before sitting their family down and telling them.  I don't think the kids cried because they didn't support her. I think they cried because of their mom's sake. \n\nOp you're the bad guy for how you reacted. I get that in that moment it just came out but you should've asked , did you tell your wife and kids first?. Or does your family know?.. you could've even said. Now wasn't the time of place.\n\n But i get why you did it though", "YTA Did she not handle this the kindest way when it came to her immediate family? No, she did not.  What you are not taking into consideration is the trauma she went through to get to where she is now.  This wasn\u2019t about you.  This was a matter for her and her immediate family to work through.  You could have supported all of them better.\n\nYou aren\u2019t a main character in this story.  It was not your job to step in as a hero or villain, just observe and play a supportive role to the people who mattered to you.", "YTA. As someone who is trans, we are not obligated to come out when YOU feel like it\u2019s the right time. Should she have handled things a lot better? Yeah, of course. But your (aunt?) is old enough to determine when the right time is to come out to her family.", "YTA, You do not get to decide how someone else comes out!", "This story is fake as fuck. Trans people do not come out this way. Stop posting fake shit designed to excuse transphobia.", "ESH. All I can say is wow.", "ESH. People can come out at ANY age. My good friend was 65 when she did and had her surgery at 67. They live their entire life in a body that they feel is not theirs and then when they finally have the courage to be honest, you yell at them?

In my case - it was because I tried to come out to a few people who I trusted to be safe at first... and I was wrong about who was safe. So they took from me my ability to safely come out to other people. It put me as a minor at the time into a lot of danger because, contrary to popular belief, they don't really care about the actual safety of minors who claim they are trans - they only care that those minors decide they aren't trans and they often will do quite a lot of terrible things to those children to make that the case. Like I learned about some people, she's learned that you specifically were an unsafe person to talk to about this stuff and may believe that of your whole family based on her reaction.\n\nMy guess is that she started speaking to you and your family about it as a stepping stone while she was figuring out how she wanted to deal with it - which is not an uncommon practice with trans people just because of how fraught it can be to march to the beat of your own drum in a world that only likes one kind of tune.\n\nBeyond that - for all you know, at the time, she may have been unsure about what she was talking about. You don't give a lot of details here other than 'not quite feeling like a man' which is relatively broad and doesn't necessarily scream to me 'definitely trans' off the bat. It can take a lot of time for trans people, especially older ones who are only now really starting to be exposed to these words because they were part of a generation that didn't encourage such presentation. I'm 30 myself now and I've had the privilege to know a few genuinely elderly trans people and I've heard a lot of these kinds of sentiments echoed by them over and over again.", "YTA \n\nI agree that maybe more communication with her wife as the marriage broke down would have been a kindness \n\nBut that\u2019s not your business \n\nYour business was to support your uncle or at the very least shut up", "Info:what is your age?

She\u2019s been married for 42 years and has 4 kids. Her and her wife have been separated for a few months but, are still \"trying to sort out their differences.\"\n\nEvery year around March, the whole family holds a sort of Spring banquet. Due to their separation my uncle and her wife arrived, well, separately. My uncles wife arrived first with the kids. Not long after my uncle showed up. She was wearing a full face of makeup, and a dress. At first everyone thought it was some kind of joke and started laughing but, soon realized it wasn\u2019t. When we sat down for dinner she fully came out and said she identified as woman now. My uncles wife almost immediately burst into tears and left the room. Her eldest went after her while the rest of us stared at my uncle in shock.\n\nNow here\u2019s where it gets interesting. My uncle has expressed \u201cnot feeling like a man\u201d to some of the family (including me).   It was why we pushed for her to get a divorce. When they got separated, we thought my uncle had finally told her, come to find out she did not.\n\nBack to the dinner table. My uncles wife and son had run out and the youngest was in hysterics. So, I lashed out. It wasn\u2019t the smartest thing to do looking back but, I told her she was a selfish piece of shit and if she thought anyone was proud, she\u2019d been snorting too much coke. She left immediately.\n\nA few days ago, my mother called me and and said I\u2019d taken it too far and that my uncle wasn\u2019t responding to anyone\u2019s calls or texts.\n\nI know I was a bit harsh but, it wasn\u2019t the right place or time to reveal that. Especially when she hadn\u2019t told her wife and kids. For everyone to know something like this was up, except for her, I honestly feel terrible for my uncles wife. \n\nThis is a 64 year old we\u2019re talking about, to come out that way after so long. I love my uncle. My uncle was the first person to teach me how to ride a bike, drive but this is just\u2026\n\nI think I could\u2019ve been more sensitive so, AITA.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA. Your uncle was married to her wife for 42 years, she still didn't feel the need to tell her wife that she's trans before transitioning? AH behavior. Your poor aunt, she did not deserve this. Imagine being married to somebody for 42 years and they still don't respect you enough to tell you the VERY BASIC details of their life.", "NTA. Your uncle should have handled this better.", "the uncles wife and child would have been in such shock so their reactions are warranted, while not ideal, you can excuse their actions due to the way the uncle decided to come out publicly without informing the wife or child who are his closest family. Its just a bit shitty. \n\nwhich is probably why op reacted how they did which ofc could have been handled better but in those circumstances most people won't be using logic. \n\nOverall, the uncle is definitely an asshole to their wife and kids and could have handled the situation much better, however OPs reaction in the moment while not ideal is excusable in those circumstances.", "ESH- it was definitely the wrong time and a very mean thing to do to your own wife and children. But it seems like you overreacted and were unnecessarily mean.", "ESH \n\nYeah, she definitely needed to come out to the closest family first, but dude. You didn't have a right to act like that, man.", "She should have spoken to her ex and children first.  This is very personal and shocking.  It wasn't appropriate to just spring it on them in front of everyone without giving them a chance to understand, ask questions,  etc.  Your comment was harsh,  but she WAS selfish to make the occasion all about her and she had to have known the effect it would have on her loved ones", "YTA. Your comments to your uncle were not constructive or helpful in any way. You were just making a bad situation be about yourself.", "NTA. Everyone worried about his feelings but not his poor wife and children has me \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "YTA\n\nYour relative should have talked to their ex and their children before making their gender identity public. But your calling them names and lashing out at them is grade-A a**hole behavior. \n\nYou didn't make things better for anyone, just showed everyone what a jerk you are. Coming out at age 64, during a time of extreme anti-trans sentiment is TERRIFYING. If I hadn't come out and transitioned when I did (over 10 yrs ago in my early '20s), I'd probably stay in the closet for my own safety - assuming I even made it this long anyway.\n\nYou don't fix bad situations by being an a**hole, you just show everyone what an a**hole you are.", "Yta\n\nYes it sucks but it looks to me like she was drowning and needed to rip the bandaid off. Nobody knows that feeling but her. And people need to stop this \u201cright time\u201d with coming out shit. No. They do it when they do it and stop expecting them to keep lying about it.", "Yta. That was a disgusting thing to say, and she most likely took your comments as you telling her she was disgusting and selfish for being a trans woman.", "soft yta\nmy father is transgender. she didn't know until 20 some odd years into her and my moms marriage. my mom is straight but shes stayed married to my dad because she loves her. i dont really see why you blew up at your uncle. it sounds like she just figured herself out completely.", "How do we know the wife didn\u2019t know? All it said was wife burst out crying and left the room. Seems like a reasonable response if wife was aware uncle felt this way but wife was still processing or didn\u2019t want others to know yet (but it\u2019s not wife\u2019s choice) or it made it all seem real or even in a way announced the marriage is over (assuming wife is straight she would no longer be attracted to uncle). Wife could be going through a lot of emotions right then but I don\u2019t see anything that said wife didn\u2019t know.\n\nThis is in my opinion supported by the fact that wife didn\u2019t have a huge reaction to uncle entering dressed as a woman but broke down when uncle \u201cmade it official\u201d by specifically telling everyone how she felt.", "At 64 years old?! YES IT FUCKING IS. \n\nthat shit was HEAVILY  stigmatized for the vast majority of his/ her (yes really her) life.  \n\nI'm not a boomer as the subject is, but I'm an older Gen-xer, it was NOT OKAY decades ago.  Who could she trust? \n\nOP is NTA for having a reaction, but the uncle (ok, aunt )isn't really either. \n\nTimes change.  We move forward.", "If you think that coming out as trans at the age of 60 is easy, fucking meet trans people, holy shit", "How is coming out in front of everyone rude isn\u2019t that how it works you come out to EVERYONE no matter who it is.", "Do you clock how that sounds transphobic or honestly not?", "She.", "Why should the immediate family have to be supportive?  This is a huge life changing situation - the wife has been lied to for years, the children are going to be upset that dad now expects to be mum.  They have every right to be angry, and telling them that they have to be supportive and all 'yay go you, live your truth' when they have dropped a major bombshell into the family life is unfair and dismissive of their right to their own feelings.", "Can I give you an advice? You are not transphobic, but the reason why your comment might come off as such is because she has no responsibility to share such information (and if nothing else, you can kinda understand why she might've not) It might've been a good and correct thing, but by saying that a trans person has the obligation to share this information with someone is transphobic. You wouldn't say, for example, that I have obligation to disclose to my parents that I will get a face tat: sure, it might be NICE to say that, but I don't have such OBLIGATION. Creating a different standard for trans people is what's wrong here.", "She said she didn\u2019t feel like a man (she\nexpressed this to just my family, mother, sister and me) so the extended family didn\u2019t know. When we had this conversation, I wasn\u2019t completely sure she was trans. I didn\u2019t want to make such a big assumption on minimal information. I thought maybe non-binary or even just her getting older - there is some deeper issue that I don\u2019t think I should discuss which is part of the reason why we told her to consider divorce. When they\u2019d separated I thought she told her everything. I feel like at least had she known that she wouldn\u2019t be blindsided. Just like the extended family who didn\u2019t know about it.", "her family  \n\nshe had told her ex wife\n\nhow she was feeling", "I think there must be something that isn\u2019t being stated by OP (perhaps they aren\u2019t aware themselves). I tend to agree that \u201cthe uncle\u201d owes it to her ex wife and children to have those conversations first, but I have a hard time believing that she would have subjected her kids to that without having a very valid reason.", "But was it reasonable for OP to add to the chaos by lashing out? Sure the coming out could've been handled better, fine, but what is helped by creating more conflict?", "*her", "Do you not know how hard it is for us to come out? I took time to come out because I was terrified! I was scared of getting shut out by family. I was scared of being ridiculed. I was scared of being thrown out of my house. These things have happened to trans people who came out to their families.", "[removed]", "I agree, aunt could have done things better for sure. \n\nBut what's up with the random \"snorting too much coke\" comment. Seems like a backhanded way to disapprove of other stuff aunt does.", "Yeah. This in a nutshell. I feel very sorry for the wife and kids, but also for OP's uncle, who couldn't be her authentic self all those years, and who then chose one of the worst ways to reveal her transition to her family. I think ESH as well, since OP made a bad situation worse.", "I get most of what you\u2019re saying, minus the part about the uncle taking OPs reaction the wrong way. OP already knew she was trans, as uncle had come out to OP before all of this- so they knew OP was supportive, because OP had been pushing for the divorce and for her to live as her authentic self.", "Exactly and someone that old is used to being deathly afraid of coming out. I get OP's point of view and she could have expressed that better but that is also not the right way to come out when you've been in the closet for so long.", "That's actually interesting. I'm sure some people would think the idea of \"grieving\" is itself transphobic, but I'm almost certain it's just human nature. Of course, part of being human is walking that moral tightrope; I personally do find it weird to ask a trans person to respect your sadness over their former identity. Sort of makes it sound like you preferred it when they were still pretending to be cis, but again, you're not. I guess it would be like losing a friend, but...not really?", "I agree with your judgment for the most part. But I take issue in you using neutral and masculine pronouns for her.", "*Her, she, and her :)", "You are using the wrong pronouns. Uncle uses she/her", "I mean she\u2019s 64, if I saw my 64 yr old uncle who has identified as male their whole life, has children and a wife, show up to a family function dressed in women\u2019s clothing and wearing makeup, I\u2019d definitely be surprised and think he was pulling our leg. OP could have handled it differently but I bet the shock of the moment played into their reaction", "Well NTA then sorry for using wrong noun but yeah that\u2019s too much", "Thinking it\u2019s dickish to not be considerate to her wife and kids doesn\u2019t mean OP is dictating how she gets to come out. Someone\u2019s identity struggle\nalso doesn\u2019t mean they get to be an AH without consequences. I get that OP\u2019s uncle must\u2019ve suffered greatly hiding who she was, but she also doesn\u2019t get to be upset thinking that OP\u2019s outburst was transphobia when it was very *very* clearly about the uncle hurt her wife and kids.", "[deleted]", "Op is not mad a the fact that uncle came out as trans is the fact that uncle never informed her wife and kids about it first. Op is angry at the way that uncles wife and kids found out and honestly uncle was supposed to inform them privately the same way she did the rest of the family. Op wants to know if they are the asshole for the way op reacted. In my opinion uncle needed a reality check because if she could come out to the majority of the family in private, she could have came out in private before the big reveal to wife and kids as well.", "Thank you. Finally someone who's not bashing the trans person in this", "If this was a matter for her and her immediate family, why do it in front of everyone. And I\u2019m not trying to be a main character/hero/villain whatever. I acted on impulse it wasn\u2019t right but, I did", "As a member of the LGBT community I'm going to say that if someone comes out in a manner that is completely callous and will hurt their loved ones...you can say that it's a fucked up thing for them to do. It's completely and totally insensitive and cruel to SUDDENLY come out to your family like this when you haven't even told your spouse or kids. You don't get a free pass to do whatever the hell you want just because you're LGBT or it's \"part of your journey.\"", "So the uncle keeping the news from their wife and kids and then springing it on them at a public family gathering is cool?

First of all, you don\u2019t usurp someone else\u2019s event (family Easter) and make it about you. Throw your OWN coming out party. And second, according to OP, wife though her spouse was trying to work things out, and yeah, springing on a change of gender (and wife\u2019s orientation) is for a private discussion, not at a family Easter. Wife was owed a chance to process this news in private, and frankly so we\u2019re the kids. \n\nIt\u2019s as fucking weird as announcing your divorce at Christmas.

Also, the % of people who dump spouses who come out as cross-dressers was something like 95% back then. I can't imagine what misguided notion caused the uncle to think coming out to her wife, kids, and extended family was a good idea. \n\nI'm wondering what the uncle told her wife about why she was wearing a wig, make-up, and traditionally feminine dress to the family gathering. Did she lie and say it was a joke?", "And if the wife was still under the impression that they were \"trying to work things out\" - not only was the declaration of trans a shock, it was basically a declaration that 'nope, it won't work out - def getting divorced', which - that's an unpleasant shock in itself, and also something that should have been disclosed privately before making a public announcement.", "And the kids!! OMG not sitting your wife and kids down privately and having that conversation but instead blindsiding them in public is just yikes. How does she expect her relationship with her children to be a good one after doing it this way?", "Why? What is this supposedly serious thing that some parties need to be told in private?", "It's still misgendering to call her \"they\" when she has stated she wants to be called she. Do you call random people you know are women they? No. You call them she.", "This is usually true, yes, but 'they' should generally only be used when 1. You don't know the person's gender, or 2. They use those pronouns. We know the uncle's pronouns, it's she/her, so using 'they' instead of the pronoun she prefers is just as disrespectful as using he/him", "Using \"they\" to avoid correctly gendering trans people is super shitty.", "You can use \"they\" to refer to a person whose pronoun preferences you don't know or whose pronoun preferences include neutral pronouns. If a person has expressed, for example, that their preferred pronouns are exclusively the feminine she/her, then calling her \"they\" or calling her \"he\" are both misgendering", "Not if someone has asked you to use another pronoun. If someone has asked to be called \"she/her\" and you call them \"they,\" you're still using the wrong pronoun.", "Agreed. I\u2019d feel the same way if she\u2019d stood up and announced she was moving to France without telling her estranged wife and their kids first. This is a big thing that is going to affect all of their lives. It\u2019s quite likely a sign uncle and wife will not be reconciling, that their separation _will_ end in divorce. It\u2019s shitty and selfish to spring that on your wife and kids.", "Trauma? Really", "So it\u2019s her fault the family is breaking up because of who she is? I feel like everyone\u2019s overreacting about this. I mean people announce important decisions in a huge public family event all the time. Why is this different?", "They already knew", "Right? I feel like maybe uncle thought no one would yell at her and that her family wouldn't make a scene if they were in public?

Op's remarks were not \"Uncle, you should have told Auntie and your kids first, and then came out to the rest of us all after they had a few weeks to react.\" Op's remarks were to call Uncle a coke head and say that nobody cared about them.

Another friend had a spouse transition to female 5 years into her marriage. Despite a valiant effort on both sides, they couldn\u2019t make it work because my friend is straight and attracted to men, and her spouse was a woman. \n\nSo, like, no, wife isn\u2019t suddenly a lesbian.

Not it a \"you can't be openly trans when you have kids\" way, you still should be yourself. But you do actually have to tell them privately and give them a bit of time to come around, during that time you can go tell other people sure, but doing it for the first time publicly around other people is cruel and an AH move.\n\nPeople not being owed an explanation for your gender identity means that if you want to stay closeted it is your right. It means you do not have to tell your parents if you do not wish to, it means you don't have to tell your best friends, it means that if your bisexual you can for your protection pretend to be straight and marry someone of the opposite sex and settle down and keep it to yourself. It means that if you really want to you can pretend to be cis and not ever transition (you can also change your mind later on, but you shouldn't marry someone with the intention to transition later without telling them).\n\nWhat it does not mean is when you and your partner are separated but working it out you can suddenly bring someone of the same sex in front of your kids and separated partner with no previous warning then expect a good reaction. What it does not mean is you can start to transition on the side without ever letting the person your married to know. Those are things you do actually owe the people closest to you the information on so they have time to process it. To not is selfish.\n\nNow I don't know if OP was the AH here. Their lashing out felt unnecessary and didn't actually come across as \"not the right time\" and instead came across as \"how dare you be trans.\" But their anger here is justified.", "Sorry but no. You have an obligation to tell your immediate family before going public, especially before going public in front of them.", "Thing is, nothing that happened in this situation was reasonable. And people do not always react to emotional situations with reason. Given how the uncle chose to come out, an emotional and hurtful outburst was nearly guaranteed. I don't think OP is an asshole for having such a reaction given the situation.", "I get that! 100%\n\nI don't think that the uncle was wrong not to have come out sooner or to have kept her gender a secret for so long. It's a tough choice to make and made tougher by our culture.\n\nI do think the uncle was wrong to do it the way she did. And, in the end, the way she did it seems to have caused more of a rift with her family and more condemnation than if she'd first privately told her wife and kids or even first privately told her other family members.\n\nNone of this needed to be in front of everyone.\n\nHowever, I am sure that the lapse in judgment on the uncle's part was likely due to the fears you mentioned. Fear can make humans make bad decisions.\n\nIt still doesn't make OP the AH for how they reacted, because that was born out of the messed up moment, and that's valid, too.\n\nThis all makes me wish the uncle had made better choices, because maybe if she had she wouldn't be feeling so lonely and hurt right now.

However, the (aunt?) may have a genuine reason as to why she didn\u2019t tell her wife or kids.

I feel bad because she was blindsided with the entire thing in front of an audience during what was probably already a tense and difficult moment for her (first family gathering after the separation.) \n\nShe was not given any space to process things in private, she had to do that in front of her ex's entire extended family *and* their kids.", "The way the uncle told her wife was indeed a very poor way of doing it. She (uncle) should have sat her (wife) down and discussed this together so that the wife, and possibly kids, wouldn\u2019t be blindsided. Or may have chosen not to attend if this was how she wanted to come out to the rest of the family. \n\nOP- NTA, it sounds like your reaction was more based on your feelings about how her wife and kids reacted.

It's not the uncle's fault she realized late in life? We can feel bad for her because of the separation, the impending divorce, the stress of handling the kids, and definitely the way the uncle chose to come out because it should have been handled in private first instead of at a tense and awkward family gathering. But the way you phrased it makes it sound like we should pity her for being \"deceived\" or something. People learn things about themselves and their worldview changes and sometimes that means that something that worked before doesn't work now. We can sympathize with the difficulty of separating and getting a divorce and the futility of knowing they've grown apart, but to feel bad that her former partner is now identifying as a woman instead of a man is a weird take. It comes off as finding something wrong with trans people and the journies that unfortunately sometimes go as planned. I hope that's not what you meant, but it's how it reads.", "Like at a therapists office!", "Exactly, it wasn\u2019t only the wife who was blindsided by the public announcement, it seemed to also be the kids. They all deserved more respect than that.", "This was a real grounding point for me in this situation.  \n\nI hate when women are made to be unwitting beards, raising children, and keeping a home just to have the rug ripped out from underneath them once the childrearing is done. Used and then disposed of with lies of love.\n\nI think it might just be one of those situations that is just awful no matter how you slice it. The person assigned male at birth is pressured into living a certain kind of life, and it's brutal but doable to fake it. It certainly was not, and arguably, is still not safe to come out as trans.\n\nBut women have always been at the whim of the provider, and it just feels like all the agency has been taken by her husband (ex-wife). A lot of trans women will tell their wife and see if divorce is needed first (some women are bi after all). They don't divorce and then surprise them at a family function. Uncle should have given her some choice, or if she didn't love her anymore, a heads up in the situation instead of this onslaught of continued (and now public) changes. Even if the choice was \"you're right, I also want a divorce.\" \n\nBut coming out earlier is just not a point that can be argued due to safety. And I don't know, maybe the wife is also not a safe person to trust with this first, and it needed to be public in the uncle's mind. It's just a whole mess, really, and I'm not surprised the \"wrong\" decisions were made.\n\nEdit : I can't comment anymore, but please read the replied comment. Lgbtq+ people do not lie to those around them when they are in the closet, though some people will and do. Many simply do not yet know that they are gay or trans yet, and it will take time to get there. Especially for someone in their 60s.

The fact that the uncle is trans is not the problem. The uncle hiding that is understandable and not the problem. Coming out in the way she did?

Some figure it out quick, some don\u2019t. It takes introspection, exploration, and self honesty to figure these things out. You need to be in the right headspace for it to click.

I may have worded it too harshly?", "Who knows if the Uncle was even allowed or able to contact her wife? People do get blocked, and maybe she was trying to tell her wife\u2026. Before!

If her own family reacted this way, imagine her fear to come out to people who she didn't teach to ride a bike and drive.\n\nBack to OP - \"I think I could've been more sensitive.\" I don't think you could have been more insensitive.

ESH at most. She IS who she is. It's not your right to gatekeeper when the right time to 'reveal' it is. Your uncle/aunt and aunt have been divorced and their own people.

It's not like it was an event focused on a specific person/people  where it could potentially take away the spotlight. it was just a general family gathering. You lashed out at her for not doing anything wrong and confirmed her worst fears: you don't accept her as she is, and you won't take her side. It's possible that this was the only was she felt comfortable coming out.\n\nCould it be argued that maybe she should have talked to aunt first? Sure. But at a certain point after a divorce the other person just isn't your reasonability anymore. Your reaction was out of order. At the end of the day this is a matter of feelings. Should the aunts feelings be protected or uncle forced to pretend? It's also entirely possible she didn't feel comfortable telling aunt alone.\n\nI have a lot of trans friends and what I've learned is that coming out is extremely difficult and there may be only a certain situation/way that the person feels able to do it. Sometimes, this may clash with how other people feel but at the end of the day it's got to happen for everyone to move on.

Here though I can\u2019t help but feel that the way she went about coming out wasnt fair. It was a pretty massive thing to spring on her wife and children and in such a way. Yes she can come out how she wants, but I can\u2019t help but feel it\u2019s a bit selfish and a slap in the face to have done it in such a manner, no respectful talk to her wife who she was married to for decades, no explanation or talk to her kids (who were extremely confused and upset and may not have fully understand what was going on), nothing. \n\nSure no one has to do anything for other people, but having understanding of others peoples feelings (the type of understanding she was hoping to get about her sexual identity) is important too.
