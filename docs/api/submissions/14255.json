Her and her wife have been separated for a few months but, are still \"trying to sort out their differences.\"\n\nEvery year around March, the whole family holds a sort of Spring banquet. Due to their separation my uncle and her wife arrived, well, separately. My uncles wife arrived first with the kids. Not long after my uncle showed up. She was wearing a full face of makeup, and a dress. At first everyone thought it was some kind of joke and started laughing but, soon realized it wasn\u2019t. When we sat down for dinner she fully came out and said she identified as woman now. My uncles wife almost immediately burst into tears and left the room. Her eldest went after her while the rest of us stared at my uncle in shock.\n\nNow here\u2019s where it gets interesting. My uncle has expressed \u201cnot feeling like a man\u201d to some of the family (including me). It was why we pushed for her to get a divorce. When they got separated, we thought my uncle had finally told her, come to find out she did not.\n\nBack to the dinner table. My uncles wife and son had run out and the youngest was in hysterics. So, I lashed out. It wasn\u2019t the smartest thing to do looking back but, I told her she was a selfish piece of shit and if she thought anyone was proud, she\u2019d been snorting too much coke. She left immediately.\n\nA few days ago, my mother called me and and said I\u2019d taken it too far and that my uncle wasn\u2019t responding to anyone\u2019s calls or texts.\n\nI know I was a bit harsh but, it wasn\u2019t the right place or time to reveal that. Especially when she hadn\u2019t told her wife and kids. For everyone to know something like this was up, except for her, I honestly feel terrible for my uncles wife. \n\nThis is a 64 year old we\u2019re talking about, to come out that way after so long. I love my uncle. My uncle was the first person to teach me how to ride a bike, drive but this is just\u2026\n\nI think I could\u2019ve been more sensitive so, AITA.\n\nEdit: Seen a few comments about this so, I quickly wanna say, she said she was fine with using uncle/ dad etc but wanted to be referred to as she/her and her new name.", "created_utc": 1680917777, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12f75iw/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_uncle_for_coming_out_as/", "score": 555, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I agree with commentors who say you are never too old or young to come out. I agree with commentors who say that you do not get to dictate when others come out.  I hope it's not taken as transphobic when I say that I DO think that she had an obligation to give wife & children this information before coming out to the extended family. It's 42 years of marriage, 4 children. Many trans people chose not to have spouses and children even though they remained in the closet. It's literally in this case not just about her. Her immediate family, while they should be supportive, deserved the opportunity to process this without the involvement of the wider group.", "Info- Your story isn\u2019t clear.

It\u2019s unacceptable for her to blindside her wife and children like this in public.", "Nta that was the worst time and place they're selfish", "ESH. You should not have said that to her.

The public setting was not the way to go. \n\nIf you want to maintain a relationship with your uncle, call her or go out to lunch with her and try to mend fences.

Both you and your relative handled this poorly.\n\nI agree that her wife should not have been told so publicly.  But there were better ways for you to express that.\n\nObviously, she wanted to do the coming out all at once and get it over with. It's very stressful, so I can understand,  but not very considerate of her wife and kids. Also, the dramatic and confrontational approach made it more likely that people would respond badly.\n\nBut you really made the worst of the situation, and it's likely that she has interpreted your reaction in the worst possible way.\n\nFor someone who has been in the closet that long, coming out at all is pretty terrifying. And, it's not like there was some way to do it where her wife and kids wouldn't be upset.", "NTA\n\nThe way your uncle came out and transitioned was extremely hurtful and painful to her own family. This really reminds me of how Caitlyn Jenner came out and did not allow any of her family any opportunity to process the change.\n\nShe may have felt like a woman for decades; however, she lead her immediate family to believe otherwise. When she decided to come out she did not give any of her immediate family an opportunity to process it before demanding it be recognized and respected.\n\nWhen this happens to a family unit where the trans person has had a long term established relationship with their immediate family as one specific gender and identify, it is very important that the immediate family be given the opportunity (even briefly) to process the grief of knowing that person for who they always have known them as so that they can move forward and actively accept them for who they are now.\n\nWhen that grieving process is denied, nothing but hurt and painful feelings are the result.", "NTA it was incredibly messed up for your uncle to not address this with their wife before announcing in the company of others. I understand that it\u2019s hard to come out and probably more difficult the older you get because you become used to living in a way that isn\u2019t authentic to who you are. But the fact remains that the more people who will be directly and deeply affected by this change in your life, the more responsibility you have to be aware and sensitive to this. Just as your uncle wants people to be aware and sensitive to their situation, I imagine. His wife and kids deserved better. Coming out without giving them time to process in private was an asshole move on their part.", "NTA. Everyone was kinda blindsided and it was inappropriate for her to come out this way. She should've spoken to her wife first and let her have some time to process.", "NTA, you don\u2019t wait come out for that long, and having children, that\u2019s just wrong to do your partner", "Eh, NTA. Uncle was an egregious AH and you had an honest familial reaction. If the uncle wasn't trans and showed up with a new lover unannounced I wouldn't bat an eye at you calling her selfish, etc.\n\nYou definitely could have handled it better though, always best to keep a calm head. You seem like a younger member of the family. Given your uncle's age, an elder probably should have confronted her on her behavior. Probably in private.", "ESH\n\nSounds like your entire family needs a class in communication.", "NTA. Coming out as trans is difficult and I commend your uncle (aunt?) on owning her truth. But to do it like this, not give her ex and children a heads up, and do the entire family at once, was selfish and moronic.\n\nYour relative owes the rest of you an apology.\n\nOf course you owe her an apology yourself. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right.", "NTA", "NTA - no matter how hard it was for her to come out she should have given her family the dignity and respect of letting them know first.

Then again, the family's reaction to seeing her for the first time (laughter and disbelief) implies that this is a family who are either transphobic or very insular in their experiences.

How did your uncle think your aunt would feel finding out about this hidden secret at a family reunion in front of everyone?

I have nothing against trans people, but I know that if my husband came out as trans, I would be devastated because the man that I love would not be who I thought he was. I would not want to find out in a public setting. I would want to have that discussion in private. Your aunt is grieving the loss of a husband. The loss of that person she thought she knew, and now realizes she doesn\u2019t - and after so many years, it would be difficult to process such a big change.

Why were the wife and children so upset? Were they upset because they had no clue, or were they upset because they wanted the uncle to remain in the closet?

I\u2019m trans too so I can totally understand where your uncle (probably should call her aunt) is coming from. Considering recent events it\u2019s pretty hard for people to come out as trans and when you consider that we\u2019ve only really gotten visibility and awareness recently it\u2019s very understandable why she came out so late. I regret not transitioning earlier but the fact remains: you\u2019re never too old or too young to transition. I\u2019m very concerned for her right now because it seems like she feels ostracised by her own family.\n\nI am also very concerned about some of the comments that seem to be too eager at using the wrong pronouns. A stark contrast to the love I got on another AITA thread.", "So, it was perhaps a misguided choice for her to come out to everyone at once instead of her kids and spouse first. We don't know her reasoning, there are many possibilities as to why she did that.   \nHowever, YTA 100%. Your reaction was extremely cruel and it's clear to me that you care far more about everyone else than her. Your post doesn't paint you as particularly remorseful. Most of your post is about how terrible this is for her wife. Aside from the lack of tact and trust, I don't see why she is so hysterically upset--for christ's sake, her partner is trans, not dead or cheating! Maybe her wife doesn't like or accept trans people, I mean, she seems awfully upset to be married to one.   \nPeople don't always know they are trans until they are older. People don't always accept themselves until after years of denial. People come out when they can. And coming out, especially to family, can be absolutely terrifying. Maybe she felt safer coming out in a group with certain supportive presences there. Maybe this was the only way she could bring herself to do it, or maybe it was a rash decision after a long time of anxious deliberation. Fear and stigma doesn't help us make good decisions.   \nAt any rate, she finally came out, showed who she really was, even got dolled up (which is even harder if you're new to it,) and what happened? Her family laughed at her, her spouse and kids freaked out, and you stepped in and told her \"she was a selfish piece of shit and if she thought anyone was proud, she\u2019d been snorting too much coke.\" \n\nAnd you're not even *worried* now that she's not answering anyone's efforts to contact her?", "Mesh( except the wife and kids. They should've been told first. Now imagine how the uncle's wife feels. You don't know how long your spouse felt that way. You don't know if your marriage is a lie. You don't know even know if the person you married is who they say they are/ if you were used as a cover.\n\nThe uncle is a jerk because they shouldn't have done it before sitting their family down and telling them.  I don't think the kids cried because they didn't support her. I think they cried because of their mom's sake. \n\nOp you're the bad guy for how you reacted. I get that in that moment it just came out but you should've asked , did you tell your wife and kids first?. Or does your family know?.. you could've even said.

My good friend was 65 when she did and had her surgery at 67. They live their entire life in a body that they feel is not theirs and then when they finally have the courage to be honest, you yell at them?

In my case - it was because I tried to come out to a few people who I trusted to be safe at first... and I was wrong about who was safe. So they took from me my ability to safely come out to other people. It put me as a minor at the time into a lot of danger because, contrary to popular belief, they don't really care about the actual safety of minors who claim they are trans - they only care that those minors decide they aren't trans and they often will do quite a lot of terrible things to those children to make that the case. Like I learned about some people, she's learned that you specifically were an unsafe person to talk to about this stuff and may believe that of your whole family based on her reaction.\n\nMy guess is that she started speaking to you and your family about it as a stepping stone while she was figuring out how she wanted to deal with it - which is not an uncommon practice with trans people just because of how fraught it can be to march to the beat of your own drum in a world that only likes one kind of tune.\n\nBeyond that - for all you know, at the time, she may have been unsure about what she was talking about. You don't give a lot of details here other than 'not quite feeling like a man' which is relatively broad and doesn't necessarily scream to me 'definitely trans' off the bat. It can take a lot of time for trans people, especially older ones who are only now really starting to be exposed to these words because they were part of a generation that didn't encourage such presentation. I'm 30 myself now and I've had the privilege to know a few genuinely elderly trans people and I've heard a lot of these kinds of sentiments echoed by them over and over again.", "YTA \n\nI agree that maybe more communication with her wife as the marriage broke down would have been a kindness \n\nBut that\u2019s not your business \n\nYour business was to support your uncle or at the very least shut up", "Info:what is your age?

She\u2019s been married for 42 years and has 4 kids. Her and her wife have been separated for a few months but, are still \"trying to sort out their differences.\"\n\nEvery year around March, the whole family holds a sort of Spring banquet. Due to their separation my uncle and her wife arrived, well, separately. My uncles wife arrived first with the kids. Not long after my uncle showed up. She was wearing a full face of makeup, and a dress. At first everyone thought it was some kind of joke and started laughing but, soon realized it wasn\u2019t. When we sat down for dinner she fully came out and said she identified as woman now. My uncles wife almost immediately burst into tears and left the room. Her eldest went after her while the rest of us stared at my uncle in shock.\n\nNow here\u2019s where it gets interesting. My uncle has expressed \u201cnot feeling like a man\u201d to some of the family (including me).   It was why we pushed for her to get a divorce. When they got separated, we thought my uncle had finally told her, come to find out she did not.\n\nBack to the dinner table. My uncles wife and son had run out and the youngest was in hysterics. So, I lashed out. It wasn\u2019t the smartest thing to do looking back but, I told her she was a selfish piece of shit and if she thought anyone was proud, she\u2019d been snorting too much coke. She left immediately.\n\nA few days ago, my mother called me and and said I\u2019d taken it too far and that my uncle wasn\u2019t responding to anyone\u2019s calls or texts.\n\nI know I was a bit harsh but, it wasn\u2019t the right place or time to reveal that. Especially when she hadn\u2019t told her wife and kids. For everyone to know something like this was up, except for her, I honestly feel terrible for my uncles wife. \n\nThis is a 64 year old we\u2019re talking about, to come out that way after so long. I love my uncle. My uncle was the first person to teach me how to ride a bike, drive but this is just\u2026\n\nI think I could\u2019ve been more sensitive so, AITA.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA. Your uncle was married to her wife for 42 years, she still didn't feel the need to tell her wife that she's trans before transitioning? AH behavior. Your poor aunt, she did not deserve this. Imagine being married to somebody for 42 years and they still don't respect you enough to tell you the VERY BASIC details of their life.", "NTA. Your uncle should have handled this better.", "the uncles wife and child would have been in such shock so their reactions are warranted, while not ideal, you can excuse their actions due to the way the uncle decided to come out publicly without informing the wife or child who are his closest family. Its just a bit shitty. \n\nwhich is probably why op reacted how they did which ofc could have been handled better but in those circumstances most people won't be using logic. \n\nOverall, the uncle is definitely an asshole to their wife and kids and could have handled the situation much better, however OPs reaction in the moment while not ideal is excusable in those circumstances.", "ESH- it was definitely the wrong time and a very mean thing to do to your own wife and children. But it seems like you overreacted and were unnecessarily mean.", "ESH \n\nYeah, she definitely needed to come out to the closest family first, but dude. You didn't have a right to act like that, man.", "She should have spoken to her ex and children first.  This is very personal and shocking.  It wasn't appropriate to just spring it on them in front of everyone without giving them a chance to understand, ask questions,  etc.  Your comment was harsh,  but she WAS selfish to make the occasion all about her and she had to have known the effect it would have on her loved ones", "YTA. Your comments to your uncle were not constructive or helpful in any way. You were just making a bad situation be about yourself.", "NTA. Everyone worried about his feelings but not his poor wife and children has me \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "YTA\n\nYour relative should have talked to their ex and their children before making their gender identity public. But your calling them names and lashing out at them is grade-A a**hole behavior. \n\nYou didn't make things better for anyone, just showed everyone what a jerk you are. Coming out at age 64, during a time of extreme anti-trans sentiment is TERRIFYING. If I hadn't come out and transitioned when I did (over 10 yrs ago in my early '20s), I'd probably stay in the closet for my own safety - assuming I even made it this long anyway.\n\nYou don't fix bad situations by being an a**hole, you just show everyone what an a**hole you are.", "Yta\n\nYes it sucks but it looks to me like she was drowning and needed to rip the bandaid off. Nobody knows that feeling but her. And people need to stop this \u201cright time\u201d with coming out shit. No. They do it when they do it and stop expecting them to keep lying about it.", "Yta. That was a disgusting thing to say, and she most likely took your comments as you telling her she was disgusting and selfish for being a trans woman.", "soft yta\nmy father is transgender. she didn't know until 20 some odd years into her and my moms marriage. my mom is straight but shes stayed married to my dad because she loves her. i dont really see why you blew up at your uncle. it sounds like she just figured herself out completely.", "How do we know the wife didn\u2019t know? All it said was wife burst out crying and left the room. Seems like a reasonable response if wife was aware uncle felt this way but wife was still processing or didn\u2019t want others to know yet (but it\u2019s not wife\u2019s choice) or it made it all seem real or even in a way announced the marriage is over (assuming wife is straight she would no longer be attracted to uncle). Wife could be going through a lot of emotions right then but I don\u2019t see anything that said wife didn\u2019t know.\n\nThis is in my opinion supported by the fact that wife didn\u2019t have a huge reaction to uncle entering dressed as a woman but broke down when uncle \u201cmade it official\u201d by specifically telling everyone how she felt.", "At 64 years old?! YES IT FUCKING IS. \n\nthat shit was HEAVILY  stigmatized for the vast majority of his/ her (yes really her) life.  \n\nI'm not a boomer as the subject is, but I'm an older Gen-xer, it was NOT OKAY decades ago.  Who could she trust? \n\nOP is NTA for having a reaction, but the uncle (ok, aunt )isn't really either. \n\nTimes change.  We move forward.", "If you think that coming out as trans at the age of 60 is easy, fucking meet trans people, holy shit", "How is coming out in front of everyone rude isn\u2019t that how it works you come out to EVERYONE no matter who it is.", "Do you clock how that sounds transphobic or honestly not?", "She.", "Why should the immediate family have to be supportive?  This is a huge life changing situation - the wife has been lied to for years, the children are going to be upset that dad now expects to be mum.  They have every right to be angry, and telling them that they have to be supportive and all 'yay go you, live your truth' when they have dropped a major bombshell into the family life is unfair and dismissive of their right to their own feelings.", "Can I give you an advice? You are not transphobic, but the reason why your comment might come off as such is because she has no responsibility to share such information (and if nothing else, you can kinda understand why she might've not) It might've been a good and correct thing, but by saying that a trans person has the obligation to share this information with someone is transphobic. You wouldn't say, for example, that I have obligation to disclose to my parents that I will get a face tat: sure, it might be NICE to say that, but I don't have such OBLIGATION. Creating a different standard for trans people is what's wrong here.", "She said she didn\u2019t feel like a man (she\nexpressed this to just my family, mother, sister and me) so the extended family didn\u2019t know. When we had this conversation, I wasn\u2019t completely sure she was trans. I didn\u2019t want to make such a big assumption on minimal information. I thought maybe non-binary or even just her getting older - there is some deeper issue that I don\u2019t think I should discuss which is part of the reason why we told her to consider divorce. When they\u2019d separated I thought she told her everything. I feel like at least had she known that she wouldn\u2019t be blindsided. Just like the extended family who didn\u2019t know about it.", "her family  \n\nshe had told her ex wife\n\nhow she was feeling", "I think there must be something that isn\u2019t being stated by OP (perhaps they aren\u2019t aware themselves). I tend to agree that \u201cthe uncle\u201d owes it to her ex wife and children to have those conversations first, but I have a hard time believing that she would have subjected her kids to that without having a very valid reason.", "But was it reasonable for OP to add to the chaos by lashing out? Sure the coming out could've been handled better, fine, but what is helped by creating more conflict?", "*her", "Do you not know how hard it is for us to come out? I took time to come out because I was terrified! I was scared of getting shut out by family. I was scared of being ridiculed. I was scared of being thrown out of my house. These things have happened to trans people who came out to their families.", "[removed]", "I agree, aunt could have done things better for sure. \n\nBut what's up with the random \"snorting too much coke\" comment. Seems like a backhanded way to disapprove of other stuff aunt does.", "Yeah. This in a nutshell. I feel very sorry for the wife and kids, but also for OP's uncle, who couldn't be her authentic self all those years, and who then chose one of the worst ways to reveal her transition to her family. I think ESH as well, since OP made a bad situation worse.", "I get most of what you\u2019re saying, minus the part about the uncle taking OPs reaction the wrong way. OP already knew she was trans, as uncle had come out to OP before all of this- so they knew OP was supportive, because OP had been pushing for the divorce and for her to live as her authentic self.", "Exactly and someone that old is used to being deathly afraid of coming out. I get OP's point of view and she could have expressed that better but that is also not the right way to come out when you've been in the closet for so long.", "That's actually interesting. I'm sure some people would think the idea of \"grieving\" is itself transphobic, but I'm almost certain it's just human nature. Of course, part of being human is walking that moral tightrope; I personally do find it weird to ask a trans person to respect your sadness over their former identity. Sort of makes it sound like you preferred it when they were still pretending to be cis, but again, you're not. I guess it would be like losing a friend, but...not really?", "I agree with your judgment for the most part. But I take issue in you using neutral and masculine pronouns for her.", "*Her, she, and her :)", "You are using the wrong pronouns. Uncle uses she/her", "I mean she\u2019s 64, if I saw my 64 yr old uncle who has identified as male their whole life, has children and a wife, show up to a family function dressed in women\u2019s clothing and wearing makeup, I\u2019d definitely be surprised and think he was pulling our leg. OP could have handled it differently but I bet the shock of the moment played into their reaction", "Well NTA then sorry for using wrong noun but yeah that\u2019s too much", "Thinking it\u2019s dickish to not be considerate to her wife and kids doesn\u2019t mean OP is dictating how she gets to come out. Someone\u2019s identity struggle\nalso doesn\u2019t mean they get to be an AH without consequences. I get that OP\u2019s uncle must\u2019ve suffered greatly hiding who she was, but she also doesn\u2019t get to be upset thinking that OP\u2019s outburst was transphobia when it was very *very* clearly about the uncle hurt her wife and kids.", "[deleted]", "Op is not mad a the fact that uncle came out as trans is the fact that uncle never informed her wife and kids about it first. Op is angry at the way that uncles wife and kids found out and honestly uncle was supposed to inform them privately the same way she did the rest of the family. Op wants to know if they are the asshole for the way op reacted. In my opinion uncle needed a reality check because if she could come out to the majority of the family in private, she could have came out in private before the big reveal to wife and kids as well.", "Thank you. Finally someone who's not bashing the trans person in this", "If this was a matter for her and her immediate family, why do it in front of everyone. And I\u2019m not trying to be a main character/hero/villain whatever. I acted on impulse it wasn\u2019t right but, I did", "As a member of the LGBT community I'm going to say that if someone comes out in a manner that is completely callous and will hurt their loved ones...you can say that it's a fucked up thing for them to do. It's completely and totally insensitive and cruel to SUDDENLY come out to your family like this when you haven't even told your spouse or kids. You don't get a free pass to do whatever the hell you want just because you're LGBT or it's \"part of your journey.\"", "So the uncle keeping the news from their wife and kids and then springing it on them at a public family gathering is cool?

First of all, you don\u2019t usurp someone else\u2019s event (family Easter) and make it about you. Throw your OWN coming out party. And second, according to OP, wife though her spouse was trying to work things out, and yeah, springing on a change of gender (and wife\u2019s orientation) is for a private discussion, not at a family Easter. Wife was owed a chance to process this news in private, and frankly so we\u2019re the kids. \n\nIt\u2019s as fucking weird as announcing your divorce at Christmas.

I 100% understand why he hadn't told me before: HE hadn't come to terms with it, himself and had been raised in a conservative, blue collar town where NOBODY admitted to cross-dressing. Also, the % of people who dump spouses who come out as cross-dressers was something like 95% back then. I can't imagine what misguided notion caused the uncle to think coming out to her wife, kids, and extended family was a good idea. \n\nI'm wondering what the uncle told her wife about why she was wearing a wig, make-up, and traditionally feminine dress to the family gathering. Did she lie and say it was a joke?", "And if the wife was still under the impression that they were \"trying to work things out\" - not only was the declaration of trans a shock, it was basically a declaration that 'nope, it won't work out - def getting divorced', which - that's an unpleasant shock in itself, and also something that should have been disclosed privately before making a public announcement.", "And the kids!! OMG not sitting your wife and kids down privately and having that conversation but instead blindsiding them in public is just yikes. How does she expect her relationship with her children to be a good one after doing it this way?", "Why? What is this supposedly serious thing that some parties need to be told in private?", "It's still misgendering to call her \"they\" when she has stated she wants to be called she. Do you call random people you know are women they? No. You call them she.", "This is usually true, yes, but 'they' should generally only be used when 1. You don't know the person's gender, or 2. They use those pronouns. We know the uncle's pronouns, it's she/her, so using 'they' instead of the pronoun she prefers is just as disrespectful as using he/him", "Using \"they\" to avoid correctly gendering trans people is super shitty.", "You can use \"they\" to refer to a person whose pronoun preferences you don't know or whose pronoun preferences include neutral pronouns. If a person has expressed, for example, that their preferred pronouns are exclusively the feminine she/her, then calling her \"they\" or calling her \"he\" are both misgendering", "Not if someone has asked you to use another pronoun. If someone has asked to be called \"she/her\" and you call them \"they,\" you're still using the wrong pronoun.", "Agreed. I\u2019d feel the same way if she\u2019d stood up and announced she was moving to France without telling her estranged wife and their kids first. This is a big thing that is going to affect all of their lives. It\u2019s quite likely a sign uncle and wife will not be reconciling, that their separation _will_ end in divorce. It\u2019s shitty and selfish to spring that on your wife and kids.", "Trauma? Really", "So it\u2019s her fault the family is breaking up because of who she is? I feel like everyone\u2019s overreacting about this. I mean people announce important decisions in a huge public family event all the time. Why is this different?", "They already knew", "Right? I feel like maybe uncle thought no one would yell at her and that her family wouldn't make a scene if they were in public? Women do get socialized to sit and not make a fuss at the family table, especially considering her age.", "I thought they were being transphobic.

She has a serious case of main-character syndrome. It's one thing to support her, but supporting her transition **should not** have to include participating in ambushing innocent, already maligned third-parties to satisfy her egotistical need for a 'big reveal'. \n\nI sincerely hope she's the one footing the future psychology bills for the kids.", "Seriously? So she gets to have her big coming out at the expense of a spouse and kids she\u2019s supposedly loved for 42 years?? Your comment about \u201cwhat\u2019s the point\u201d suggests that this is somehow all about attention and uncle getting her \u201cgrand reveal.\u201d You think uncle should just get to dictate this entire situation, and that isn\u2019t fair at all.", "By in private is hey i dont feel like a man i never have as she did the rest. Big reveal is when you change into a women and people see it for the first time as the whole family did.", "The point of the big reveal would've been coming out to everyone else. A wife and kids were not the only ones at this event; her siblings, their kids, and maybe her parents (if they're still alive) all would've been at the big get together. The benefit to the privacy would've been giving her life partner of 42 years the opportunity to process without a big crowd to see how she is feeling.\n\nEither way, though, I'm with you. Op's remarks were not \"Uncle, you should have told Auntie and your kids first, and then came out to the rest of us all after they had a few weeks to react.\" Op's remarks were to call Uncle a coke head and say that nobody cared about them. That's uncalled for, unfair, and honestly a bit confusing.\n\nOp YTA for going for personal attacks on an uncle you clearly are quite close to, rather than actually speaking to your uncle kindly regarding what you were actually upset about. You should apologise for what you said and talk about what you're saying here, which seems to be that you felt blind sided, and felt that her wife and kids were even more blind sided.", "So that devoids how they treat their loved ones? I'm sure it's difficult, but lying to people for years and then expecting them to just jump on board is selfish. Especially with how OP's uncle did it. Coming out does not absolve you from being a decent human being.", "That is no excuse to treat the people you spend your life with so far like shit.", "The person coming out then doesn't control how people react. This is absurd thinking.", "This comment it presumptuous in its self. I didn\u2019t come here for validation. I came to see other opinions on the matter. I\u2019ve read some and taken them to heart. That doesn\u2019t mean I will stand for someone to tear down, my character or my family\u2019s. A whole bunch of wrongs don\u2019t make a right - which is something I\u2019ve learned.", "Well, her partner is a woman now, so she\u2019s either  lesbian/bi/pan or she doesn\u2019t have a partner. That\u2019s a hard choice to make. Especially to tm start thinking about over Easter brunch. \n\nI have a friend who identified as lesbian her whole adult life. And then she meets a trans man that she connected with. It was a huge transition for HER to realize she wasn\u2019t as firmly into women as she\u2019d thought for 25 years. Another friend had a spouse transition to female 5 years into her marriage. Despite a valiant effort on both sides, they couldn\u2019t make it work because my friend is straight and attracted to men, and her spouse was a woman. \n\nSo, like, no, wife isn\u2019t suddenly a lesbian. But wife has to consider if she can be fulfilled in a lesbian relationship. Or deal with the end of a 40 year relationship if she isn\u2019t. Which is probably scary as shit for someone in their 60s on a fixed income who envisioned a different life for themselves in their final years. So, yeah, the poor lady deserved to be told in private.", "Everyone Sucks Here\n\nAnd don't be afraid to ask! That's how we learn! :-)", "Because this is a huge, tectonic shift to the current family dynamic which is 42 *years* in the making.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with being out and proud! That\u2019s amazing! But to do it like that is to disregard their valid feelings and says you don\u2019t respect them enough to speak to them one on one about a life altering decision", "Because as others have said, it\u2019s a huge change for her wife and kids. They deserve the respect of being told first so they can process this change.", "Oh fuck off. You are not seriously implying that someone coming out as trans *to their spouse* isn\u2019t a big deal.", "Its something that she should let her wife and kids have time to process in private not in front of the rest of their family. The wife in particular because this has massive implications on their relationship, they haven't fully divorced or anything. Like it is her identity and all but I think there are people close enough to her that its gonna impact them strongly, namely wife and kids, and those are people she should have extra consideration for? If they're adult kids maybe less so there but for sure the wife", "Typically I use they for strangers and specific pronouns for people I know.\n\nIf I\u2019m telling a story about about talking an interaction I had with a stranger, I refer to that person as they.\n\nThe word \u201cthey\u201d is perfectly appropriate to use for ALL people.

Its very easy it is to think of examples where you remove the \"appeal to inclusivity and diversity\" and just reduce things to basically decent and considerate human behaviour.\n\nIt doesn't matter what your own situation is or what diagnoses you have.  If you put yourself first all the time, put everyone else last all the time, and then play manipulative games to maintain that power dynamic, then you are an asshole.  Its as simple as that.\n\nInclusivity and diversity is great.  Caring for people with differing needs is great.  It doesnt help anyone when people use the good nature of humanity to play bullshit games.", "yeah it is in fact pretty traumatizing to find out that your spouse has been lying to you/hiding who they really are from you for a number of year and then creating a situation where they announce that publicly without giving you a chance to process privately.", "As the child of a mtf dad (what I called her), yeah. It\u2019s trauma. It\u2019s traumatic no matter how it\u2019s handled because something fundamental to your life is rocked. But it can be handled in a way that makes it less traumatic. And this ain\u2019t it. \n\nThis is shaking someone\u2019s foundations to the core without concern for your family\u2019s feelings. This family is about to change dramatically and the person in question didn\u2019t pause for one moment to think about the feeling of her spouse of 40 years or her children. THAT is the AH move.", "You can support trans people and trans rights and still think that individuals can act like AH's.\n\nBeing trans doesn't mean you get to treat your wife and kids like they are meaningless people who have no feelings and don't love you.or have a special bond than means you talk to them about this before you go public.", "This is different because normally, when big announcements are made, the immediate household family members (spouse, children) are given the respect of being told first. I'd be pissed if my spouse/parents announced a pregnancy, major move/career change, marriage/divorce, etc. to the family without first talking to me/the kids - coming out in any capacity falls into the same category. Prioritizing feeling good about announcing in a huge public setting over showing your spouse/children basic respect over *major* life changes is the issue here.\n\nETA: That said, I do think OP responded poorly. It did nothing but throw fuel to an already tense fire. I have more thoughts on this, but wanted to keep this comment focused on the one point.", "They aren't \"breaking up because of who she is\". Quit projecting. \n\nThe family is breaking up because of how poorly it was handled. \n\nPeople can announce an important decision that affects *them* in any way they choose. But to blindside your family with something like that in a public way.. it's fucking selfish and not ok.", "If she felt this way for so long, how can you be the wife and not feel betrayed? I understand societal pressure for staying in the closet - and nobody should have to feel that - but staying true to who you are means you don't get married to a woman who does not know you're trans and have 4 children. And if you do that anyway you owe it to them. Acceptance is necessary for trans people - deadnaming is wrong, not using proper pronouns is wrong, not giving acceptance to this person's truth is wrong - saying you can't do these things is intellectually lazy. But it's got to be different when you're talking about mom and dad, husband and wife. It's not just about being in the closet, it's living a total and complete lie for 42 years and then popping your truth on everyone in a very public way and expecting nobody to be upset about that.", "No they don't. Have you not seen all the AITA posts telling people that a big family event is NOT the time to make important annoucements? If you have an engagement, a pregnancy, or a coming out - make that your own event.", "If \"who she is\" involves 100% hiding this from the wife she divorces and the child she fathered until an event for the whole family, then she's a weak and inconsiderate person.\n\nIn ANY family event, you announce something to the extended family something you ALREADY DISCUSSED with the immediate family.

I mean if they did then kids would not get kicked out of their houses and disowned. The SH rate would plummet. The world would be an overall better place and coming out could be celebrated in stead of anxiety inducing. You putting words in my mouth is absurd thinking!", "No, of course not.

A lot of people wouldn't care, but I also know of many people who would.", "The family literally pressured her to divorce her wife. Of course trans people can be dicks.
