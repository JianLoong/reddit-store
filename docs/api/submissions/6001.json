The rule with destination weddings is you're welcome to have one, but people are welcome not to show up. I do think in general siblings are the ones you should make the effort for, but if you can't afford it you can't afford it and that's all there is to it.

What a ridiculous waste of money if they truly wanted the love and support of their friends and family they would not be having an expensive destination wedding.
