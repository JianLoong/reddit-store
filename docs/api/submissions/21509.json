{"id": 21509, "submission_id": "14se1vn", "title": "AITA for asking my boyfriend's siblings to reschedule their trip so I could still go with them?", "selftext": "My(32F) boyfriend(27M) has had an overseas trip planned with his siblings and their spouses for a number of years. They've all been saving for it but when the global 'thing' happened they had to cancel. I've known about this trip since before we started dating when we were just friends. Once we were together for a while, he invited me to go too. I accepted.\r  \n\r  \nThe trip has been scheduled for later this year and we were supposed to be gone for a little over a month. I am up for promotion next year and to keep my chances high, it means a lot of travel and training for my job this year. One of the training sessions is during the trip. Obviously, I put my career first because better pay means more travel opportunities in the future. I was upset when I told him I wouldn't be able to make it and suggested that either we go by ourselves and then plan to go with his family in a couple of years or we talk to his family about rescheduling for next year. He said no because the time picked was already the time that worked best for everyone and they want to get a long overseas trip finished before their kids are older and they start taking more kid-friendly vacations. I could not get him to see my point of view regarding scheduling or how it's kind of cruddy to go on vacation for a month without the person you're talking about moving in with and marrying, plus I'll really need his support during that time.\r  \n\r  \nI think it's pretty reasonable to bring it up with his siblings so I created a group chat and explained the situation to them and how my talk with their brother went. I also thought that maybe if he heard my concerns from married people close to him he'd get the picture. His brother and sister pretty much repeated what he said about rescheduling and told me I should be alright with him going because I know how much it means to him and these plans predate his relationship with me. I accepted their no and that was that but I guess they did talk to him just not about rescheduling. He called me and was disappointed I \"went over his head\" to talk to his family like that and I had made myself look bad because he was now having to defend me to his family that I'm not controlling or want everyone to do things my way because of my decisions.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?\r", "created_utc": 1688660455, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14se1vn/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriends_siblings_to/", "score": 586, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His family has been planning this trip for some time, and you were invited but you were *never* central to the trip. You should be acting like a guest in the family at this point. To ask them to reschedule a long-planned vacation because your schedule changed was extremely entitled, and to ignore your boyfriend\u2019s \u2018no\u2019 and go over his head made it way worse. You should be grateful you were even invited, much less asking people to rearrange the trip for you.\n\nI\u2019d be reconsidering the relationship if I were him. He\u2019s having to defend you to his family that you\u2019re not controlling and want everyone to do things your way\u2026and he\u2019s having a hard time because that IS how you are. You need to sincerely apologize and reconsider your behavior.", "YTA. You were a plus one invite, not the main character.", "YTA\n\nThey have been planning this for years. Even before you all were together. You honestly think they are going to postpone something like this. He told you a pretty good answer but you wouldn't hear it. \n\nWhat you thought would happen was his family would side with you. You honestly sounded like you were trying to manipulate the situation and make him the bad guy.", "You accepted his family saying NO, why didn\u2019t you accept your BF\u2019s NO in the first place? YTA here and a very entitled one expecting everyone to change their plans for you. \nThink you might have shown some \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 to your bf abs his family.", "YTA. It might have been okay to ask your boyfriend the first time to wait for you, but once he said \"no\" that should have been it. \n\nIt was really inappropriate to create a group chat that excluded your boyfriend, and recruit his family to put pressure on him to get your way. It was definitely controlling. There's no better way to describe it. The only way your boyfriend can defend you is for him to say, \"she's not usually this controlling.\" Hopefully, it's true that you aren't usually like this.", "YTA. They\u2019ve had this trip in the works for years. The two of you can take a different trip at another time; no one is under any obligation to reschedule the trip for you. Get over yourself.", "YTA, you are not the center of the universe.  BF needs to rethink the relationship.", "YTA. This was long arranged.  What were you thinking?? Obviously,  you weren't thinking about your bf, or anyone else but yourself. You chose your career aspirations over the trip, and that's ok. You can't have it both ways.", "YTA:  Here's what stood out to me. This new job means a lot of traveling for you.  So in other words he should be ok with you traveling for work a lot this next year but you think it's unreasonable he want to go on a trip he been planning for years.", "YTA\n\nYou are choosing to put you career over this trip, you've made that choice.\n\nThey've been trying to plan this trip for years (before you were even in the picture) and they finally found a time that works for everyone. And it sounds like the career opportunity came up after you all had agreed on this timeframe for the vacation, you previously okayed this.\n\nSure it would be extremely nice of them to completely replan this vacation but they're already on a time crunch. They need to do this before the kids grow up and they're years behind. You're the one not understanding your boyfriends POV in this situation, it's unfortunate but you needed to accept that you can't go.\n\nGoing behind your boyfriend's back like that was shitty, that's what makes you the asshole here. You've made a terrible impression on you boyfriend's family, and that's something you won't be able to fix.\n\nEDIT: Used the word husband not boyfriend", "Holy cow. yep, YTA. Huge one!\n\nThe options you gave him are to:\n\n1. have him *not* go on a family trip while you are in training. OR\n\n2. Have everyone reschedule. Including married couple with kids that already have to juggle. Just to accomodate your training.\n\nHow can you not see that you are being completely unreasonable?? Then to text the family group chat after your bf said no to try to get your way? I think that's absurd.", "YTA. Your job being your priority is not a bad thing. It is great even. However, your job can't be other's priority. Join for part of the trip? Let is be real this is about the siblings being together, your presence there is more of a nice extra.", "YTA. Nobody thinks your important enough to reschedule this whole trip for. Your not some main event who needs to be pampered. You either go or stay home. Nobody is going to ruin this trip to accommodate for you.", "Wow, way to overstep. YTA. (Good luck on the promotion though!)", "YTA. I am ***amazed*** that you made this pre-planned family trip all about you.", "YTA\n\nThe question was asked & answered. No means No\n\nIt appears your have very little respect for your boyfriend. Why would you ever think it would be okay to talk to his family about rescheduling \u201ctheir\u201d trip? You were always only going to be a guest on this trip. \n\nIf you can\u2019t attend a wedding do you call the bride or groom to have the wedding rescheduled? Hopefully, no. This is boyfriend\u2019s family event. Not your event.", "yes, YTA. you *chose* to put your career first and make yourself unavailable for the trip. they shouldn't have to change a trip they've been planning for years because of it! and going behind your boyfriend's back after he said your crazy idea wasn't going to happen is just... mindblowingly bad. disrespectful, sneaky, rude, not your place at all, the list goes on.", "N T A to ask your BF.\n\nYTA for not accepting his no and trying to get his family to strong-arm him into agreeing to your request.\n\nGood luck on the promotion.", "Yeah YTA. I can only imagine the coordination it took to schedule a month long trip for multiple families, some of whom have children. It isn't so easy to just reschedule such a thing. They've also already waited a long ass time because of the pandemic. You request to your bf was fine, but talking to his family without telling him was not.", "YTA definitely. You did go over his head and not only is that disrespectful but asking for them to change plans they all have had for years is selfish and disrespectful. Wtf kind if entitlement is that?", "YTA You want EVERYONE to reschedule a trip that\u2019s already planned to accommodate your work schedule.  Who\u2019s to say that your work won\u2019t interfere with the next vacation? You\u2019re seriously out of line, and his family is right to find you controlling, not to mention entitled.", "YTA and a selfish one to boot.", "YTA. Your proposal was crap and when it was rejected you went behind your boyfriends back like a kid trying to back one parent in a corner when they tell them no. \n\nThis trip isn't about you and you need to stop trying to make it all about you. Like...these plans are literally older then your entire relationship. \n\nIt is unfortunate that you are unable to go but it is what it is. You and your boyfriend will have more opportunities to travel together in future. In the meantime let them finally enjoy their long awaited family trip.", "I don't know if you're an asshole, a bit delusional perhaps. No one is going to reschedule a long planned family trip because sibling X has a new partner who wants to tag along. The entire trip was planned before your partner meet you. Where you stray into asshole territory is when you created a group chat to try and persuade your partner's siblings to reschedule.", "YTA. So just to be clear, this trip predates your entrance into the family, and has been in the making for a while now, you chose to do a training opportunity instead of going on vacation, and when your boyfriend told you he wasn\u2019t going to ask to move the date, you went ahead and directly asked his siblings to see if they might change the date, and after everyone told you no that\u2019s when you accepted it? You wanted everything to revolve around you so much so that you under minded your boyfriend\u2019s decision and made him feel uncomfortable and aggravated with his family when he now has to defend you. Nobody is in the wrong here but you.", "YTA, you're entitled and going behind his back was sneaky. You made your choice, so accept it.", "YTA - yeah but,....\n\n*I'm not controlling or want everyone to do things my way because of my decisions.*\n\nThis is exactly what you are doing.  I mean to the \"T\".  You didn't take no from your SO, and you went to \"persuade\" his family by going over his head to see things your way.  Also, I really cringed at this:\n\n*I could not get him to see my point of view regarding scheduling or how it's kind of cruddy to go on vacation for a month without the person you're talking about moving in with and marrying, plus I'll really need his support during that time.*\n\nThis is why they say you are acting controlling.  \"Could not get them to see MY way\"  Really?!?!\n\nLastly, this trip was planned with his FAMILY(not friends) for years with a time stamp on it.  You can't get around the timing part because time has run out for the family to take this trip how they want to before the kids will have to be factored into future vacations.", "YTA. Wow. They have had this trip planned for literally years. They are gracious enough to include you. Now you think you and your career should be more important than their years of planning. Make it make sense. You seem either young and clueless or seriously entitled. Your boyfriend was trying to save your reputation when he didn\u2019t want you to talk to his siblings. Now his family is aware and probably judging whether your entitled or clueless. This doesn\u2019t look good for you.", "YTA, you were just invited, if you can\u2019t then don\u2019t go but you can\u2019t seriously think a whole family is going to reschedule such long and complicated trip just because BF\u2019s new girlfriend wants to go but can\u2019t. Not to insult you but seriously even thinking about it nonetheless asking is kinda embarrassing for you, im sorry but you\u2019re so in the wrong for me.", "YTA - This is a siblings trip.  One they were planning pre-you.  They've already had to cancel once due to covid, but now you think they should cancel again just for you and your needs.  They already had worked out a date that worked for everyone.  Not their fault it no longer works for you.  When that happens, you bow out gracefully, not stomp around like an elephant.\n\nFor the love of a good family membership, why did you go past your bf and go to the siblings.  Do you not respect your bf?  You're going to be the one they talk negatively about from now on.", "I\u2019m just going to hang out on Reddit until one of the siblings post about their brother\u2019s (ex?) GF in r/EntitledPeople.\n\nYTA. What nerve.", "YTA. This trip is not about you, it's about your boyfriend's family. And note, you are not yet part of your boyfriend's family. You're not even engaged. At present, you have absolutely zero standing to even consider making this request. And even then, if you were married to your current boyfriend, this would still be about him and his family, not you.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" He called me and was disappointed I \"went over his head\" to talk to his family like that \"", "YTA...Your bf is right on both counts. This is a special trip planned that you were invited to, unfortunately you can not attend. Its unreasonable for you to try to convince anyone to reschedule for a trip you were invited to, and its worse to expect your boyfriend not to go without you when you are the one who is deciding not to go..(career first, which is fine, but thats still your choice).\n\nYou seem very entitled and  selfish.", "Uh yeah, YTA. \n\nThis trip has been in the works even before you two even started dating, and now you think the entire group should put themselves out to reschedule just for you, someone they don\u2019t even know very well? The no from your boyfriend should have been enough. Creating a group chat with his family members to plead your case again makes you look needy and desperate. Not a good look in front of people who could be your in-laws in the future. \n\nAnd why do you say you\u2019ll need his support during that time? If you can\u2019t be away from him for a month and be independent, maybe you should reevaluate why you feel that way. That\u2019s not a sign of a healthy relationship.", "Step 1: \"Obviously, I put my career first\" \ud83d\udea9 Adults in relationships, Male and Female should make well thought out career decisions based on theirs needs and goals with consideration to others in their lives.  Not \"Obviously\".  Maybe this isn't really how it happened, but that is what I read the words posted. \n\nStep 2:  Ask the BF.  This was OK but a bit self-centered. Sadly, you didn't read the room.\n\nStep 3:  Create group chat, now in the AH danger zone \ud83d\udea9\n\n**Next Steps:**  Contact the travel agent of companies the trip is booked with, and change everyone's trip dates to suit you, since this is clearly what they were communicating, you are special and everyone else wants to treat you like the amazing unicorn that you are.\n\n\"Obviously\" I see this all working out really well for you.", "YTA.\n\nTrip is planned, then you have an opportunity arrive. You made your choice, and it\u2019s not a bad choice.\n\nNow here\u2019s the bit you\u2019re missing.\n\nThis trip isn\u2019t about you.\nIt was planned without you.\nYou were kindly invited to join.\n\nNow, personally, I think you were an AH to suggest changing the trip to your boyfriend, and equally as bad, if not worse, suggesting he shouldn\u2019t go because of your choice.\n\nBut just in general, bypassing him to address his family about it was massively AH behavior. And of course they\u2019re now going to judge you for being selfish and entitled, because clearly you are, plus you don\u2019t even has the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of youth as an excuse.\n\nBe an adult. Do better. Though his family isn\u2019t going to forget this.", "YTA, you made your choice by putting career first. That's great, but you have to learn that you can't sit on two chairs. You can't expect to make decisions that change smth that was planned for many ears and expect everyone to accomodate you", "YTA. Your boyfriend has every right to be disappointed.", "YTA. Every point you made as to why your bf is wrong, was you being selfish. You want him and his family to change plans to accommodate your career choice, and so your bf will be around to support you. Maybe you should be more mature, and tell your bf you won't go, but to have a great time and support HIM.", "YTA. Serious main character syndrome", "YTA, and just threw some MAJOR red flags.  I wouldn't be surprised if his family starts suggesting he break up with someone so out of touch and entitled. \n\nThey have had a plan for YEARS. Saving, planning, and you, a latecomer to this and a guest, want them all to just arrange around you.  Hope that crown isn't too heavy as your lowly subjects don't bow to your whims.\n\nYou are not married, you are just a girlfriend, but probably not for long as your career is obviously more important than the relationship.", "YTA, self-centered one too!", "Well if the shoe fits... YTA", "YTA you where invited alone. Then when you can\u2019t go no one can go.\n\nYour bf better listen to his family. If your this controlling and dramatic with out living together or being married it will only get worse.\n\nYour ruined any good relationship you may have had with your future inlaws. Because now they see you as controlling and entitled.", "I think that because you weren\u2019t already in a group chat with the siblings and set one up especially without your boyfriend YTA. They\u2019ve scheduled it already. If you get your promotion you might not be available for a month of in the future. The trip was planned before you were on the scene and you think they should move it to suit you?", "Gosh - you even have to ask?  YTA, sorry.\n\nYou're making yourself the main character in a story that's not even about you here.\n\nHonestly the only justification needed is that he declined when you wanted him to turn a family trip into a couples trip on a different date then put his family off for \\*literal years\\* so you tried to end around him.  That is, in fact, controlling behavior and you're kinda lucky he's defending you against that accusation because this was a bad decision on your part and you put him in a bad spot there.\n\nI respect your dedication to your work, no sarcasm, but that dedication sometimes comes with a cost.  The opportunity cost of keeping yourself in the running for that promotion, in this case, is this vacation.  I think it's wildly selfish and unfair of you to expect a group of other people to all delay something they've been trying to plan for years to accommodate you alone.  If this was just you and BF?  I feel differently.  It's not and you should probably take a step back here.", "YTA. The world doesn't revolve around you and existing plans for an entire group should not change just because of you, and you are insanely entitled to think they should.", "Why are you trying to make this trip about you?? YTA and you know it", "YTA. Wow. First, really think long and hard about your attitude towards work. These types of things will always come up and prevent you from vacationing and doing other things. This attitude will not give you more free time, it will give you golden handcuffs. Second, it's not \"cruddy\" of him to go on the trip that's already been planned. Maybe if you'd told him you needed his support and then his family invited him on the trip and he accepted I'd see that POV, but you've known about the trip for a long time. And third, which puts you in break up territory, is talking to his family. That's unhinged.", "YTA. I\u2019m laughing at the thought of receiving that kind of text from a brother\u2019s girlfriend. \u201cCan you believe this shit? I have to move my long-planned vacation because of *her* work? LOLOLOL no and no.\u201d", "YTA. Can\u2019t say any more because everyone already said it so well", "YTA 100%.  Go or don't go.  It's their trip, long planned.  Sometimes disappointment happens.", "YTA\n\n>I could not get him to see my point of view\n\nYour \"point of view\" is that either your boyfriend skips a family trip he's been waiting years for or everyone rearranges the trip to fit your schedule. Nothing you're asking for is reasonable. Sit this trip out and focus on the promotion. If you manage not to screw up this relationship, you can always go on the next family trip.", "What do you want?  A vacation or a promotion?  Sometimes, there is no compromise.  The plans move along without you.  It's not your place to ask for this to be rearranged for you.  Your boyfriend goes on the trip as he planned.  During that month, he's gone, if you choose to stay home, you pull up your socks & get to work on that promotion.  It was not right for you to start a group chat either.  Bad manners.  You are not representing yourself well.    The more you twist & shout about this, the farther away you'll be from his family.", "Of course you are and you know it. This has been planned for years and you want everyone to reschedule just for you. Really?", "B R U H . . . . . . .\n\n*YTA*", "YTA he gave you a clear explanation as to why he would still go and not reschedule but you chose to ignore him because you didn\u2019t like his answer. \n\nYou forced him into a position where he had to defend you to his family because you refused to accept his answer. \n\nHe should be allowed to go on a family trip without you, considering the fact you guys aren\u2019t even married yet. \n\nI\u2019m curious did you date a younger guy because you thought he would do whatever you say? You clearly don\u2019t respect his opinion as an adult, seeing as you went behind his back.", "YTA. Do you respect your boyfriend? Because it doesn\u2019t appear so based on your actions.", "YTA, and a very selfish one. How could you have the audacity to ask them to reschedule hahahaha. If I was your boyfriend I would be so embarrassed and would definitely reconsider the relationship.", "YTA. You went behind your bf\u2019s back when you created the group chat. Well, it backfired in more ways than one. Not only are his siblings not amenable to what you proposed, they now see your true colours in full technicolour. You\u2019ve got a lot of making up to do if you want to keep your bf, but also have good relations with his family.", "YTA and you owe *everyone* a massive apology, you *way* overstepped.", "YTA.  You want 6+ or more people to reschedule their expensive overseas vacation to better suit your schedule and needs? Yikes.  Hopefully your BF sees your entitlement as the massive red flag it is", "YTA and pretty short sighted if you think going on this vacation to skip some training would be the make or break of your career. I\u2019ll tell you right now - they\u2019ve already decided if they\u2019re giving you the promotion. That training means jack shit. Go on the vacation. Don\u2019t tell them to reschedule.", "YTA.  You were invited as a courtesy, you don't get to change the trip.", "YTA.  I am guessing you just pushed your way out of a relationship.", "YTA. You should NEVER have went to his siblings without talking to him first. You did make yourself look bad because it was a shitty and controlling thing to do. This trip has been planned for a number of years. It isn't cruddy of him to go on a vacation he has been planning since before you were dating, I think it is \"cruddy\" for you to try to get them change all their plans for you and for suggesting that you two just go on your own KNOWING full well this trip was planned with his family before you came into the picture.  Do you buy your audacity in bulk??? YTA.", "YTA. It's not YOUR trip. It's HIS family's trip, that you JUST HAPPENED TO BE INVITED ALONG. This trip was planned before you ever even a consideration. How entitled are you to insert yourself. WOW no words.", "YTA. Being 5 years older than him do you often mother him this way, why can't he go on holiday without his mommy? \n\nAlso what is he meant to do while you are off on your training, twiddle his thumbs at home and not play with anything hot or sharp? Grow up.", "No you\u2019re being selfish. It\u2019s fine you wanted to ask, but this trip pre-dated you. It\u2019s not all about you and the support you WANT, not need. You\u2019re trying to manipulate his family into changing his mind. He\u2019s made his wishes known. You both can have independent experiences separate to each other. YTA BIG TIME", "So they started planning this trip before you were even dating your boyfriend and you expect them to reschedule for you? YTA.", "It's a FAMILY trip. \nYou are NOT FAMILY.\nSelfish AF to ask them to change their trip for one person who hasn't been in the picture long, and as of yet not even POTENTIALLY part of the family permanently. Lucky to be invited.\n\nMy boyfriend would never have the audacity to ask me to change my family vacations for him, or interfere in any way because he has no say in family matters. Family > gf/bf.\n\nYTA", "YTA you went over his head hoping to get a different answer and they told you the same thing. And probably how you explained it to them was most likely borderline self centered. I would be tell my brother my concerns as well if his girlfriend did something like that.", "YTA. They've had it planned longer than you've been dating. When it was rescheduled, you had apparently agreed to the tineframe. You can't now change an entire trip for multiple people based on your inability to go. One person doesn't dictate the entire trip.", "YTA. This trip was being planned before you were even in the picture. You aren\u2019t married and don\u2019t live together.  You don\u2019t get to ask them to change plans for you (after bf said no). This really makes you look bad.", "YTA\n\nI get asking if it's possible to reschedule a trip, I really do.  You want to go with the man you're thinking about marrying, makes sense.  But it's one thing to ask if it's possible to reschedule for a week or 2 later and another entirely to reschedule for a year down the line.  On top of that, you need to accept the answer the first time you're told.  You ask, you get an answer, you accept it.  That's it.  Definitely don't try to go get the rest of his family on your side (and then fail, at that).", "YTA \n\nWhen he told you no you DOUBLED DOWN AND TEXTED THE GROUP CHAT? If I was him you wouldn\u2019t even be a gf let alone invited on the *family trip for siblings and SPOUSES*. Wtf?", "YTA. This trip is not about *you*. You are not central to their trip. Their plans are finalized and you should never have thought they would change that to accommodate you. It was fine to ask, but you should have known the answer was likely no. \n\nLet him go on the trip without guilt. It sounds like you have a lot of focusing to do so that you can advance your career. If you can't do that because you \"need his support\", than you have no business being in a relationship. It's great that we can support and have the support of our partners. But it should never be something that you are completely reliant on.", "YTA.  For many reasons, but first starting a text chain with his family with out checking with him first.", "YTA.  You want everyone else to change their plans and schedules for one person. You aren\u2019t married but you are showing your BF and the whole family what kind of person you are. A selfish self-centered person who isn\u2019t willing to listen to anyone else. \n\nI wish we spoke up about my BIL wife. Right now the whole family is feuding and the damage is irreparable. But after what she has put everyone through I welcome going NC with them. My other BIL says cut off the cancer.", "So join them \u201cduring\u201d\u2014 and u only vacation for three weeks instead of a month", "Unfortunately YTA as it is their trip which they planned and have worked their schedules around to have.  I do empathise with your logic and not wanting to miss part of a work opportunity.  Did you see if you could do the training session at another time or use a different media to learn the information?  Most good employers will be able to work around long term planned leave and training commitments.  I\u2019d take a step back and apologise to his family as long term it will be respected.", "Soft YTA, asking is fine and understandable, he said no from his also very understandable point of view. You should not have pushed his family, that\u2018s a bit of an overstepping of boundaries.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They've all been saving for it but when the global 'thing' happened they had to cancel. I've known about this trip since before we started dating when we were just friends. Once we were together for a while, he invited me to go too. I accepted.\r  \n\r  \nThe trip has been scheduled for later this year and we were supposed to be gone for a little over a month. I am up for promotion next year and to keep my chances high, it means a lot of travel and training for my job this year. One of the training sessions is during the trip. Obviously, I put my career first because better pay means more travel opportunities in the future. I was upset when I told him I wouldn't be able to make it and suggested that either we go by ourselves and then plan to go with his family in a couple of years or we talk to his family about rescheduling for next year. He said no because the time picked was already the time that worked best for everyone and they want to get a long overseas trip finished before their kids are older and they start taking more kid-friendly vacations. I could not get him to see my point of view regarding scheduling or how it's kind of cruddy to go on vacation for a month without the person you're talking about moving in with and marrying, plus I'll really need his support during that time.\r  \n\r  \nI think it's pretty reasonable to bring it up with his siblings so I created a group chat and explained the situation to them and how my talk with their brother went. I also thought that maybe if he heard my concerns from married people close to him he'd get the picture. His brother and sister pretty much repeated what he said about rescheduling and told me I should be alright with him going because I know how much it means to him and these plans predate his relationship with me. I accepted their no and that was that but I guess they did talk to him just not about rescheduling. He called me and was disappointed I \"went over his head\" to talk to his family like that and I had made myself look bad because he was now having to defend me to his family that I'm not controlling or want everyone to do things my way because of my decisions.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?\r\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You admit your career is priority over anything, so there\u2019s a too big possibility he will not be able to do this entire trip ever if he doesn\u2019t just go. If you somehow convince him not to go, I guarantee he will look at social media all month as they happily enjoy themselves without him and will breed resentment for you, especially as you talk about your job.

He will find it irritating he has to listen when it could have been told over the phone or waited till he got back. Anything fun or exciting you do during training? He will resent you are enjoying yourself while he sits at home watching his family have a fun time and he is left completely alone.\n\nYou might be upset when he does go, but I guarantee the resentment that would be created if he stayed would absolutely have nuked the relationship.

Jesus, be an adult already, he's only gonna be away for a month. Tough job and a lot of work? Boo fucking hoo. It was your choice to put extra work to get a promotion, you don't have to make your boyfriend suffer because of your own decisions and if you can't deal with this either by yourself or also getting support from friends and family so much that you have to have your boyfriend  there all the time, then there's something really wrong here and you're putting a lot of emotional load on him.", "YTA you know you are.

Also YTA. Your boyfriend\u2014 the one you asked to leave his family and go with you on a trip they planned before you were even together\u2014 is a grown man who has the right to say no and not allow anyone, family or not, coerce him out of his \u2018no\u2019.

Do you even have a relationship with these people that would justify reaching out to him? Or are you just his girlfriend to these people? The only scenario where I could even imagine having the audacity is one where you\u2019ve been an intimate part of their lives for years. \n\nI doubt that\u2019s the case. You disrespected everyone in this scenario: your future husband\u2019s decision, and the plans of your future family. YTA, but maybe they won\u2019t ever end up being your family like you so wish if you keep up this behavior. \n\nI would be more worried about what they\u2019re all saying behind your back than what internet strangers think, though.", "Yes you are! Seriously you think everybody should reschedule for you because of your career? And then a group chat?? Unbelievable how desperate are you. They are probably talking alot of shit about you for that. I would apologize.", "Guessing OP is regretting starting this group chat as well.  Yes, YTA.", "100% a-hole and seriously concerning that you even have to ask.", "You\u2019re 32 years old and act like an entitled 10 year old brat??!! Ya, YTA. Your whole post is a face palm and I feel bad for your bf. You\u2019re so embarrassing", "That was very embarrassing for your boyfriend.  You are not central to this trip so do get over yourself.", "YTA for asking to begin with - this group planned this trip before you were even in the picture, and I'm guessing have booked travel already?  Put in for time off work?  It stinks you can't go, but if you can't, you can't, you shouldn't expect everyone else to change for you.  And double YTA for going around you bf who already told you his answer.\n\nAlso, have you asked anyone at work about it?  If you have already set travel plans, they may make an accommodation for you.", "Yta and incredibly self centered to ask them all to reschedule or for hubby to forgo his plans to go with family", "YTA. Wow, you\u2019re truly entitled. \n\nYou literally said yourself that you\u2019re prioritizing your job over your boyfriend\u2019s plans. And then you\u2019re surprised that the plans don\u2019t change?", "YTA.  You're expecting several people to cancel their plans because you want to stay behind now.  it's irrelevant that it is training for your job.  They get nothing out of delaying except that those with children might not get to go in the future, due to child friendly vacations.\n\nYTA for going over his head once he said no.  You tried to get his family into guilting him into letting you have your way.\n\n>without the person you're talking about moving in with and marrying\n\nSeems like he has reasons now to quit talking about this since you get petty when you don't get your way.", "YsooooTA. Selfish too. Some one in the relationship heard the concerns of the married couples, hint, wasn\u2019t you.", "YTA.", "Couldn\u2019t even finish reading your post -YTA, big time. They\u2019ve been saving for YEARS! If the trip is over a month long, can\u2019t you compromise and come meet them for part of it? \nHe\u2019s going to treasure this trip with his siblings for the rest of his life and you\u2019re trying to steal that and make it about you.", "YTA. Did you even read what you wrote before you posted it? Prepare to be the ex-girlfriend because his whole family is asking your boyfriend why he's with someone so entitled.", "They, the siblings, have been planning and saving for this trip for years. Your BF invited you to come along. That was nice of him. Now you want everyone to change their plans, to put it off for another year, because it is inconvenient for you. When he explained to you why that was not possible you went behind his back to his family to manipulate them into taking your side.\n\nYou will be very lucky if he doesn't dump you.   \n\n\nYTA", "Noooooo. No no no. Girl cmon. \ud83d\ude02 You know you shouldn\u2019t have done that. These plans are from before the both of you even dated. You want his whole family to change the vacation that\u2019s been in the works for years because you can\u2019t go!? YTA\n\nHis family will also feel some type of way towards you now..", "Who doesn\u2019t want to go on a month long vacation? It sounds wonderful. But you have different priorities and acted entitled expecting that your boyfriend\u2019s family (who never had to invite you) should rearrange their schedules to accommodate your priorities. I don\u2019t see how many people this is but you said siblings and spouses so there is a minimum of 4 people plus your boyfriend who should work around you when they didn\u2019t know you when plans were made? A pandemic already made them postpone the trip. Once you get this glorious promotion, will there be another excuse for you to not being able to go?\n\nThe most disturbing part is that you say you need his support while you are doing training. No, you just don\u2019t want him to go without you. You proved it by not accepting his answer of no and contacting his family to try to get your way. \n\nYou are insecure, manipulative and controlling based on your words and actions. No matter what your boyfriend tells his family, they have seen that this is who you are and will not think highly of you.", "Wow, you are SUCH an asshole. Your boyfriend and his family had this planned for literally years and have already had to postpone. You are a recent addition, asking them to change their whole very large scale plan just for you? Tit would be one thing if these were a bunch of retired people, but they aren\u2019t. This is the time that works for them. Suck it up, tell them you\u2019ll have to miss this one, and don\u2019t even THINK about trying to ruin this fit your boyfriend by trying to make him feel guilty. \n\nTake this as opportunity for you to focus on the new job stuff while he\u2019s gone and not feel guilty for not having much time for him.", "YTA not a good move to go behind his back. Entitled much?", "YTA.\n\nWell everyone has given you the reason why YTA. Now if you want to save your relationship from the mess you created, apologize to your boyfriend and his family members for making it awkward for them.Maybe he\u2019ll bring you a nice souvenir \ud83d\ude01.", "Yta", "YT HUGE A. As soon as I found out you talked to my family without asking me, I would have immediately broken up with you.", "YTA I have second hand embarrassment for you.", "YTA\n\nWhy are you trying so hard to control your boyfriend? Going over his head after he said \"no\" is a gigantic red flag.", "YTA. Also massively overstepped your partner's boundaries. Nothing says trust and respect like not getting the answer you want and trying to manipulate him through family instead.\n\nYou could have said no to your work trip but you decided to place work/career ahead of family and the trip, that was your choice, you don't then get to try to force everyone else to work around your schedule. \n\nI see a lot of signs of problems with two people wanting to move in together but none of them are signs from your partner. hell the fact that you haven't even got to the stage of moving in but you feel you can approach his family and use them to get the outcome you want is a giant red flag.", "YTA - his family has been planning this trip for years. This trip isn't for you or about you, you are just invited as a courtesy, so you don't get to request a date change. Could you go to the training and then join them mid-trip (Or go on the trip, fly back and do training, then fly back to the trip)? That's the only reasonable thing I see.", "YTA. \n\n>I think it's pretty reasonable to bring it up with his siblings so I created a group chat and explained the situation to them and how my talk with their brother went. I also thought that maybe if he heard my concerns from married people close to him he'd get the picture.\n\nGod that's shitty behavior. Don't go over your partner's head to talk to them. You were told no, deal with it. They planned this before you were in the picture and now that you are you're welcome to come if you're able to. But it's not your trip. It's theirs.", "YTA. you admit the trip was before you and still think you\u2019re entitled to make such a request?", "Omyikes. Send your boyfriend over this way so we can talk him thru. He\u2019s not seeing the  clear red flags you are wearing like a cape.", "YTA, plenty of comments explaining why so I'm just voting", "girl \ud83d\ude2d YTA you\u2019re a guest, act like it. entitled and selfish ass", "YTA, accept that you have differing priorities for that time and neither can be compromised.", "YTA.... Good Lord how unaware are you.... let me spell this out clearly...\n\nTHIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU\n\nYou were an add on. Literally.  This was a trip they planned together and when you asked about the dates your bf said NO. So you went behind his back and tried to manipulate his family next. \n\nManipulative, egocentric, oblivious, ignorant and arrogant AH", "YTA!  You are looking at this from an extremely selfish point of view. Welcome to reality, the world does not have to accommodate you. Wish your boyfriend well and let him enjoy a long-awaited trip with his family without feeling guilt forced upon him by you.", "YTA you were aware they have been planning this trip for years even before you got togheter. And you were invited, it's not like you have to come to a family vaccation. You can make a choice to not go, for valid reasons. But you have no valid reason to ask your bf to change his plans for your career", "YTA and those 3 letters are a complete sentence for you.", "INFO: What\u2019s wrong with you? You honestly thought this was okay? WTH YTA", "YTA. WOW aren't you selfish and self-centered! Others have lives that don't revolve around you. You and your bf can take a trip together later.  This trip is with his family and he has ever right to go without you if you can't attend.\n\nApologize to him and his family. Hope he sees this as a red flag.", "YTA. You are controlling! Talking about it with your BF was one thing but when he said no, you going around him and trying to get his siblings to reschedule was overstepping. It\u2019s not your trip, they had been talking about this trip for years!! YEARS! Everyone\u2019s lives doesn\u2019t revolve around yours. Get over yourself. I hope they have a great time on this trip without you.", "YTA. And based on your attitude soon you won't have to worry about your job conflicting with family trips anymore.", "Where can I get this level of audacity? Were you born with it or can it be developed? Hahahaha I could never in my wildest dreams ever expect, let alone ask out loud for several people to change their long-standing travel plans to accommodate me because I am choosing a different personal priority. To be so unapologetic and obtuse about it, that is some next level confidence.", "YTA for so many reasons\n\n1) The world (and this vacation) doesn\u2019t revolve around you. This trip has been planned before you were even involved. \n\n2) You didn\u2019t get the answer you wanted from bf so you involved the rest of his family in something that really wasn\u2019t their business. So you\u2019re unwilling to take a no or accept boundaries. \n\n3) People can be apart for a while during the dating process and it\u2019s not a commentary on their relationship. It\u2019s actually healthy. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re excluding you. This scheduling conflict is YOUR issue. They were perfectly willing to have you along. \n\n4) I get that you\u2019re disappointed that you can\u2019t go. An adult deals with disappointment and doesn\u2019t try to mess things up for everyone else.", "Yta. You're an adult and can survive that time alone. That's a family trip, planned way before you. You don't respect your partner either. When you didn't get the results you wanted, you overstepped.", "YTA majorly and selfish. They, as a FAMILY decided on a group trip. You want to prioritize your work so you should\u2019ve gracefully bowed out or asked your job if you could go. But thinking that siblings would prioritize you in any fashion was jussi \u2026 asinine.", "JFC, YTA.  You don't get to tell someone else's family what to do.  \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA and this is a huge red flag. I would be really put off by your oblivious entitlement and selfishness if I was the partner...", "\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f \n\nYTA, OP.", "Yep. YTA. OP could easily say something like, \u201chey, for this job reason I can\u2019t go for the full vacation. But I\u2019d love to come for a bit (1-2 weeks)! So excited!\u201d\n\nBut instead she just lobbed in a grenade to the entire situation. \n\nI understand that it sucks that a significant other will be going on holiday without them (by their choice\u2026even if it\u2019s a responsible choice and investment in their future career), but it\u2019s not with a bunch of friends, it\u2019s family.\n\nMaybe consider more creative problem solving solutions in the future instead of throwing the baby out with the bath water.", "She could have met them somewhere for a week or two. Heck, I don\u2019t have enough vacation days for a month trip.\n\nThere\u2019s no rule that you have to be with them the entire time.", "Came here looking for this comment!!!", "Not even a fianc\u00e9\u2026 She\u2019s tripping", "Ohhh my god she *asked* and accepted the 'no'. 'Lobbing a grenade to the entire situation' would have been doing something that actually screwed up everyone's plans. But guess what, the plans remain", "Why do you want him to stay home and \u201csupport\u201d you when you\u2019re just going to be away training anyway?", "Sorry you aren\u2019t invited, that does suck, but I agree with how you\u2019re approaching it , I think it\u2019s mature and honestly, you\u2019ll probably have a better trip bc he\u2019s already been there.", ">I could not get him to see my point of view regarding scheduling or how it's kind of cruddy to go on vacation for a month without the person you're talking about ***moving in with and marrying***\n\nThis was really rich of the OP! They don't live together yet and she doesn't have a ring on her yet and yet she goes and starts a private chat group with his siblings and spouses looking for them to \"convince\" to go with her plans for *his family* vacation that was planned long before they were even dating. The gall of this person.", "Eww so you\u2019re saying a government piece of paper is what makes family?", "My ex decided the marriage didn\u2019t count the day after the wedding. We were together for almost 4 years. Engaged doesn\u2019t mean family apparently based on how he and his family behaved (and they behaved so badly his friends first told him his family was crazy and then later told me they took a step back from their friendship with him without even hearing my side of the story)."]}
