{"id": 21509, "submission_id": "14se1vn", "title": "AITA for asking my boyfriend's siblings to reschedule their trip so I could still go with them?", "selftext": "My(32F) boyfriend(27M) has had an overseas trip planned with his siblings and their spouses for a number of years. They've all been saving for it but when the global 'thing' happened they had to cancel. I've known about this trip since before we started dating when we were just friends. Once we were together for a while, he invited me to go too. I accepted.\r  \n\r  \nThe trip has been scheduled for later this year and we were supposed to be gone for a little over a month. I am up for promotion next year and to keep my chances high, it means a lot of travel and training for my job this year. One of the training sessions is during the trip. Obviously, I put my career first because better pay means more travel opportunities in the future. I was upset when I told him I wouldn't be able to make it and suggested that either we go by ourselves and then plan to go with his family in a couple of years or we talk to his family about rescheduling for next year. He said no because the time picked was already the time that worked best for everyone and they want to get a long overseas trip finished before their kids are older and they start taking more kid-friendly vacations. I could not get him to see my point of view regarding scheduling or how it's kind of cruddy to go on vacation for a month without the person you're talking about moving in with and marrying, plus I'll really need his support during that time.\r  \n\r  \nI think it's pretty reasonable to bring it up with his siblings so I created a group chat and explained the situation to them and how my talk with their brother went. I also thought that maybe if he heard my concerns from married people close to him he'd get the picture. His brother and sister pretty much repeated what he said about rescheduling and told me I should be alright with him going because I know how much it means to him and these plans predate his relationship with me. I accepted their no and that was that but I guess they did talk to him just not about rescheduling. He called me and was disappointed I \"went over his head\" to talk to his family like that and I had made myself look bad because he was now having to defend me to his family that I'm not controlling or want everyone to do things my way because of my decisions.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?\r", "created_utc": 1688660455, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14se1vn/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriends_siblings_to/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His family has been planning this trip planned for some time, and you were invited but you were *never* central to the trip. You should be acting like a guest in the family at this point. To ask them to reschedule a long-planned vacation because your schedule changed was extremely entitled, and to ignore your boyfriend\u2019s \u2018no\u2019 and go over his head made it way worse. You should be grateful you were even invited, much less asking people to rearrange the trip for you.\n\nI\u2019d be reconsidering the relationship if I were him. He\u2019s having to defend you to his family that you\u2019re not controlling and want everyone to do things your way\u2026and he\u2019s having a hard time because that IS how you are. You need to sincerely apologize and reconsider your behavior.", "YTA. You were a plus one invite, not the main character.", "YTA\n\nThey have been planning this for years. Even before you all were together. You honestly think they are going to postpone something like this. He told you a pretty good answer but you wouldn't hear it. \n\nWhat you thought would happen was his family would side with you. You honestly sounded like you were trying to manipulate the situation and make him the bad guy.", "You accepted his family saying NO, why didn\u2019t you accept your BF\u2019s NO in the first place? YTA here and a very entitled one expecting everyone to change their plans for you. \nThink you might have shown some \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 to your bf abs his family.", "YTA. It might have been okay to ask your boyfriend the first time to wait for you, but once he said \"no\" that should have been it. \n\nIt was really inappropriate to create a group chat that excluded your boyfriend, and recruit his family to put pressure on him to get your way. It was definitely controlling. There's no better way to describe it. The only way your boyfriend can defend you is for him to say, \"she's not usually this controlling.\" Hopefully, it's true that you aren't usually like this.", "YTA. They\u2019ve had this trip in the works for years. The two of you can take a different trip at another time; no one is under any obligation to reschedule the trip for you. Get over yourself.", "YTA, you are not the center of the universe.  BF needs to rethink the relationship.", "YTA. This was long arranged.  What were you thinking?? Obviously,  you weren't thinking about your bf, or anyone else but yourself. You chose your career aspirations over the trip, and that's ok. You can't have it both ways.", "YTA:  Here's what stood out to me. This new job means a lot of traveling for you.  So in other words he should be ok with you traveling for work a lot this next year but you think it's unreasonable he want to go on a trip he been planning for years.", "YTA\n\nYou are choosing to put you career over this trip, you've made that choice.\n\nThey've been trying to plan this trip for years (before you were even in the picture) and they finally found a time that works for everyone. And it sounds like the career opportunity came up after you all had agreed on this timeframe for the vacation, you previously okayed this.\n\nSure it would be extremely nice of them to completely replan this vacation but they're already on a time crunch. They need to do this before the kids grow up and they're years behind. You're the one not understanding your boyfriends POV in this situation, it's unfortunate but you needed to accept that you can't go.\n\nGoing behind your boyfriend's back like that was shitty, that's what makes you the asshole here. You've made a terrible impression on you boyfriend's family, and that's something you won't be able to fix.\n\nEDIT: Used the word husband not boyfriend", "Holy cow. yep, YTA. Huge one!\n\nThe options you gave him are to:\n\n1. have him *not* go on a family trip while you are in training. OR\n\n2. Have everyone reschedule. Including married couple with kids that already have to juggle. Just to accomodate your training.\n\nHow can you not see that you are being completely unreasonable?? Then to text the family group chat after your bf said no to try to get your way? I think that's absurd.", "YTA. Your job being your priority is not a bad thing. It is great even. However, your job can't be other's priority. Join for part of the trip? Let is be real this is about the siblings being together, your presence there is more of a nice extra.", "YTA. Nobody thinks your important enough to reschedule this whole trip for. Your not some main event who needs to be pampered. You either go or stay home. Nobody is going to ruin this trip to accommodate for you.", "Wow, way to overstep. YTA. (Good luck on the promotion though!)", "YTA. I am ***amazed*** that you made this pre-planned family trip all about you.", "YTA\n\nThe question was asked & answered. No means No\n\nIt appears your have very little respect for your boyfriend. Why would you ever think it would be okay to talk to his family about rescheduling \u201ctheir\u201d trip? You were always only going to be a guest on this trip. \n\nIf you can\u2019t attend a wedding do you call the bride or groom to have the wedding rescheduled? Hopefully, no. This is boyfriend\u2019s family event. Not your event.", "yes, YTA. you *chose* to put your career first and make yourself unavailable for the trip. they shouldn't have to change a trip they've been planning for years because of it! and going behind your boyfriend's back after he said your crazy idea wasn't going to happen is just... mindblowingly bad. disrespectful, sneaky, rude, not your place at all, the list goes on.", "N T A to ask your BF.\n\nYTA for not accepting his no and trying to get his family to strong-arm him into agreeing to your request.\n\nGood luck on the promotion.", "Yeah YTA. I can only imagine the coordination it took to schedule a month long trip for multiple families, some of whom have children. It isn't so easy to just reschedule such a thing. They've also already waited a long ass time because of the pandemic. You request to your bf was fine, but talking to his family without telling him was not.", "YTA definitely. You did go over his head and not only is that disrespectful but asking for them to change plans they all have had for years is selfish and disrespectful. Wtf kind if entitlement is that?", "YTA You want EVERYONE to reschedule a trip that\u2019s already planned to accommodate your work schedule.  Who\u2019s to say that your work won\u2019t interfere with the next vacation? You\u2019re seriously out of line, and his family is right to find you controlling, not to mention entitled.", "YTA and a selfish one to boot.", "YTA. Your proposal was crap and when it was rejected you went behind your boyfriends back like a kid trying to back one parent in a corner when they tell them no. \n\nThis trip isn't about you and you need to stop trying to make it all about you. Like...these plans are literally older then your entire relationship. \n\nIt is unfortunate that you are unable to go but it is what it is. You and your boyfriend will have more opportunities to travel together in future. In the meantime let them finally enjoy their long awaited family trip.", "I don't know if you're an asshole, a bit delusional perhaps. No one is going to reschedule a long planned family trip because sibling X has a new partner who wants to tag along. The entire trip was planned before your partner meet you. Where you stray into asshole territory is when you created a group chat to try and persuade your partner's siblings to reschedule.", "YTA. So just to be clear, this trip predates your entrance into the family, and has been in the making for a while now, you chose to do a training opportunity instead of going on vacation, and when your boyfriend told you he wasn\u2019t going to ask to move the date, you went ahead and directly asked his siblings to see if they might change the date, and after everyone told you no that\u2019s when you accepted it? You wanted everything to revolve around you so much so that you under minded your boyfriend\u2019s decision and made him feel uncomfortable and aggravated with his family when he now has to defend you. Nobody is in the wrong here but you.", "YTA, you're entitled and going behind his back was sneaky. You made your choice, so accept it.", "YTA - yeah but,....\n\n*I'm not controlling or want everyone to do things my way because of my decisions.*\n\nThis is exactly what you are doing.  I mean to the \"T\".  You didn't take no from your SO, and you went to \"persuade\" his family by going over his head to see things your way.  Also, I really cringed at this:\n\n*I could not get him to see my point of view regarding scheduling or how it's kind of cruddy to go on vacation for a month without the person you're talking about moving in with and marrying, plus I'll really need his support during that time.*\n\nThis is why you're they say you are acting controlling.  \"Could not get them to see MY way\"  Really?!?!\n\nLastly, this trip was planned with his FAMILY(not friends) for years with a time stamp on it.  You can't get around the timing part because time has run out for the family to take this trip how they want to before the kids will have to be factored into future vacations.", "YTA. Wow. They have had this trip planned for literally years. They are gracious enough to include you. Now you think you and your career should be more important than their years of planning. Make it make sense. You seem either young and clueless or seriously entitled. Your boyfriend was trying to save your reputation when he didn\u2019t want you to talk to his siblings. Now his family is aware and probably judging whether your entitled or clueless. This doesn\u2019t look good for you.", "YTA, you were just invited, if you can\u2019t then don\u2019t go but you can\u2019t seriously think a whole family is going to reschedule such long and complicated trip just because BF\u2019s new girlfriend wants to go but can\u2019t. Not to insult you but seriously even thinking about it nonetheless asking is kinda embarrassing for you, im sorry but you\u2019re so in the wrong for me.", "YTA - This is a siblings trip.  One they were planning pre-you.  They've already had to cancel once due to covid, but now you think they should cancel again just for you and your needs.  They already had worked out a date that worked for everyone.  Not their fault it no longer works for you.  When that happens, you bow out gracefully, not stomp around like an elephant.\n\nFor the love of a good family membership, why did you go past your bf and go to the siblings.  Do you not respect your bf?  You're going to be the one they talk negatively about from now on.", "I\u2019m just going to hang out on Reddit until one of the siblings post about their brother\u2019s (ex?) GF in r/EntitledPeople.\n\nYTA. What nerve.", "YTA. This trip is not about you, it's about your boyfriend's family. And note, you are not yet part of your boyfriend's family. You're not even engaged. At present, you have absolutely zero standing to even consider making this request. And even then, if you were married to your current boyfriend, this would still be about him and his family, not you.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" He called me and was disappointed I \"went over his head\" to talk to his family like that \"", "YTA...Your bf is right on both counts. This is a special trip planned that you were invited to, unfortunately you can not attend. Its unreasonable for you to try to convince anyone to reschedule for a trip you were invited to, and its worse to expect your boyfriend not to go without you when you are the one who is deciding not to go..(career first, which is fine, but thats still your choice).\n\nYou seem very entitled and  selfish.", "Uh yeah, YTA. \n\nThis trip has been in the works even before you two even started dating, and now you think the entire group should put themselves out to reschedule just for you, someone they don\u2019t even know very well? The no from your boyfriend should have been enough. Creating a group chat with his family members to plead your case again makes you look needy and desperate. Not a good look in front of people who could be your in-laws in the future. \n\nAnd why do you say you\u2019ll need his support during that time? If you can\u2019t be away from him for a month and be independent, maybe you should reevaluate why you feel that way. That\u2019s not a sign of a healthy relationship.", "Step 1: \"Obviously, I put my career first\" \ud83d\udea9 Adults in relationships, Male and Female should make well thought out career decisions based on theirs needs and goals with consideration to others in their lives.  Not \"Obviously\".  Maybe this isn't really how it happened, but that is what I read the words posted. \n\nStep 2:  Ask the BF.  This was OK but a bit self-centered. Sadly, you didn't read the room.\n\nStep 3:  Create group chat, now in the AH danger zone \ud83d\udea9\n\n**Next Steps:**  Contact the travel agent of companies the trip is booked with, and change everyone's trip dates to suit you, since this is clearly what they were communicating, you are special and everyone else wants to treat you like the amazing unicorn that you are.\n\n\"Obviously\" I see this all working out really well for you.", "YTA.\n\nTrip is planned, then you have an opportunity arrive. You made your choice, and it\u2019s not a bad choice.\n\nNow here\u2019s the bit you\u2019re missing.\n\nThis trip isn\u2019t about you.\nIt was planned without you.\nYou were kindly invited to join.\n\nNow, personally, I think you were an AH to suggest changing the trip to your boyfriend, and equally as bad, if not worse, suggesting he shouldn\u2019t go because of your choice.\n\nBut just in general, bypassing him to address his family about it was massively AH behavior. And of course they\u2019re now going to judge you for being selfish and entitled, because clearly you are, plus you don\u2019t even has the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of youth as an excuse.\n\nBe an adult. Do better. Though his family isn\u2019t going to forget this.", "YTA, you made your choice by putting career first. That's great, but you have to learn that you can't sit on two chairs. You can't expect to make decisions that change smth that was planned for many ears and expect everyone to accomodate you", "YTA. Your boyfriend has every right to be disappointed.", "YTA. Every point you made as to why your bf is wrong, was you being selfish. You want him and his family to change plans to accommodate your career choice, and so your bf will be around to support you. Maybe you should be more mature, and tell your bf you won't go, but to have a great time and support HIM.", "YTA. Serious main character syndrome", "YTA, and just threw some MAJOR red flags.  I wouldn't be surprised if his family starts suggesting he break up with someone so out of touch and entitled. \n\nThey have had a plan for YEARS. Saving, planning, and you, a latecomer to this and a guest, want them all to just arrange around you.  Hope that crown isn't too heavy as your lowly subjects don't bow to your whims.\n\nYou are not married, you are just a girlfriend, but probably not for long as your career is obviously more important than the relationship.", "YTA, self-centered one too!", "Well if the shoe fits... YTA", "YTA you where invited alone. Then when you can\u2019t go no one can go.\n\nYour bf better listen to his family. If your this controlling and dramatic with out living together or being married it will only get worse.\n\nYour ruined any good relationship you may have had with your future inlaws. Because now they see you as controlling and entitled.", "I think that because you weren\u2019t already in a group chat with the siblings and set one up especially without your boyfriend YTA. They\u2019ve scheduled it already. If you get your promotion you might not be available for a month of in the future. The trip was planned before you were on the scene and you think they should move it to suit you?", "Gosh - you even have to ask?  YTA, sorry.\n\nYou're making yourself the main character in a story that's not even about you here.\n\nHonestly the only justification needed is that he declined when you wanted him to turn a family trip into a couples trip on a different date then put his family off for \\*literal years\\* so you tried to end around him.  That is, in fact, controlling behavior and you're kinda lucky he's defending you against that accusation because this was a bad decision on your part and you put him in a bad spot there.\n\nI respect your dedication to your work, no sarcasm, but that dedication sometimes comes with a cost.  The opportunity cost of keeping yourself in the running for that promotion, in this case, is this vacation.  I think it's wildly selfish and unfair of you to expect a group of other people to all delay something they've been trying to plan for years to accommodate you alone.  If this was just you and BF?  I feel differently.  It's not and you should probably take a step back here.", "YTA. The world doesn't revolve around you and existing plans for an entire group should not change just because of you, and you are insanely entitled to think they should.", "Why are you trying to make this trip about you?? YTA and you know it", "YTA. Wow. First, really think long and hard about your attitude towards work. These types of things will always come up and prevent you from vacationing and doing other things. This attitude will not give you more free time, it will give you golden handcuffs. Second, it's not \"cruddy\" of him to go on the trip that's already been planned. Maybe if you'd told him you needed his support and then his family invited him on the trip and he accepted I'd see that POV, but you've known about the trip for a long time. And third, which puts you in break up territory, is talking to his family. That's unhinged.", "YTA. I\u2019m laughing at the thought of receiving that kind of text from a brother\u2019s girlfriend. \u201cCan you believe this shit? I have to move my long-planned vacation because of *her* work? LOLOLOL no and no.\u201d", "YTA. Can\u2019t say any more because everyone already said it so well", "YTA 100%.  Go or don't go.  It's their trip, long planned.  Sometimes disappointment happens.", "YTA\n\n>I could not get him to see my point of view\n\nYour \"point of view\" is that either your boyfriend skips a family trip he's been waiting years for or everyone rearranges the trip to fit your schedule. Nothing you're asking for is reasonable. Sit this trip out and focus on the promotion. If you manage not to screw up this relationship, you can always go on the next family trip.", "What do you want?  A vacation or a promotion?  Sometimes, there is no compromise.  The plans move along without you.  It's not your place to ask for this to be rearranged for you.  Your boyfriend goes on the trip as he planned.  During that month, he's gone, if you choose to stay home, you pull up your socks & get to work on that promotion.  It was not right for you to start a group chat either.  Bad manners.  You are not representing yourself well.    The more you twist & shout about this, the farther away you'll be from his family.", "Of course you are and you know it. This has been planned for years and you want everyone to reschedule just for you. Really?", "B R U H . . . . . . .\n\n*YTA*", "YTA he gave you a clear explanation as to why he would still go and not reschedule but you chose to ignore him because you didn\u2019t like his answer. \n\nYou forced him into a position where he had to defend you to his family because you refused to accept his answer. \n\nHe should be allowed to go on a family trip without you, considering the fact you guys aren\u2019t even married yet. \n\nI\u2019m curious did you date a younger guy because you thought he would do whatever you say? You clearly don\u2019t respect his opinion as an adult, seeing as you went behind his back.", "YTA. Do you respect your boyfriend? Because it doesn\u2019t appear so based on your actions.", "YTA, and a very selfish one. How could you have the audacity to ask them to reschedule hahahaha. If I was your boyfriend I would be so embarrassed and would definitely reconsider the relationship.", "YTA. You went behind your bf\u2019s back when you created the group chat. Well, it backfired in more ways than one. Not only are his siblings not amenable to what you proposed, they now see your true colours in full technicolour. You\u2019ve got a lot of making up to do if you want to keep your bf, but also have good relations with his family.", "YTA and you owe *everyone* a massive apology, you *way* overstepped.", "YTA.  You want 6+ or more people to reschedule their expensive overseas vacation to better suit your schedule and needs? Yikes.  Hopefully your BF sees your entitlement as the massive red flag it is", "YTA and pretty short sighted if you think going on this vacation to skip some training would be the make or break of your career. I\u2019ll tell you right now - they\u2019ve already decided if they\u2019re giving you the promotion. That training means jack shit. Go on the vacation. Don\u2019t tell them to reschedule.", "YTA.  You were invited as a courtesy, you don't get to change the trip.", "YTA.  I am guessing you just pushed your way out of a relationship.", "YTA. You should NEVER have went to his siblings without talking to him first. You did make yourself look bad because it was a shitty and controlling thing to do. This trip has been planned for a number of years. It isn't cruddy of him to go on a vacation he has been planning since before you were dating, I think it is \"cruddy\" for you to try to get them change all their plans for you and for suggesting that you two just go on your own KNOWING full well this trip was planned with his family before you came into the picture.  Do you buy your audacity in bulk??? YTA.", "YTA. It's not YOUR trip. It's HIS family's trip, that you JUST HAPPENED TO BE INVITED ALONG. This trip was planned before you ever even a consideration. How entitled are you to insert yourself. WOW no words.", "YTA. Being 5 years older than him do you often mother him this way, why can't he go on holiday without his mommy? \n\nAlso what is he meant to do while you are off on your training, twiddle his thumbs at home and not play with anything hot or sharp? Grow up.", "No you\u2019re being selfish. It\u2019s fine you wanted to ask, but this trip pre-dated you. It\u2019s not all about you and the support you WANT, not need. You\u2019re trying to manipulate his family into changing his mind. He\u2019s made his wishes known. You both can have independent experiences separate to each other. YTA BIG TIME", "So they started planning this trip before you were even dating your boyfriend and you expect them to reschedule for you? YTA.", "It's a FAMILY trip. \nYou are NOT FAMILY.\nSelfish AF to ask them to change their trip for one person who hasn't been in the picture long, and as of yet not even POTENTIALLY part of the family permanently. Lucky to be invited.\n\nMy boyfriend would never have the audacity to ask me to change my family vacations for him, or interfere in any way because he has no say in family matters. Family > gf/bf.\n\nYTA", "YTA you went over his head hoping to get a different answer and they told you the same thing. And probably how you explained it to them was most likely borderline self centered. I would be tell my brother my concerns as well if his girlfriend did something like that.", "YTA. They've had it planned longer than you've been dating. When it was rescheduled, you had apparently agreed to the tineframe. You can't now change an entire trip for multiple people based on your inability to go. One person doesn't dictate the entire trip.", "YTA. This trip was being planned before you were even in the picture. You aren\u2019t married and don\u2019t live together.  You don\u2019t get to ask them to change plans for you (after bf said no). This really makes you look bad.", "YTA\n\nI get asking if it's possible to reschedule a trip, I really do.  You want to go with the man you're thinking about marrying, makes sense.  But it's one thing to ask if it's possible to reschedule for a week or 2 later and another entirely to reschedule for a year down the line.  On top of that, you need to accept the answer the first time you're told.  You ask, you get an answer, you accept it.  That's it.  Definitely don't try to go get the rest of his family on your side (and then fail, at that).", "YTA \n\nWhen he told you no you DOUBLED DOWN AND TEXTED THE GROUP CHAT? If I was him you wouldn\u2019t even be a gf let alone invited on the *family trip for siblings and SPOUSES*. Wtf?", "YTA. This trip is not about *you*. You are not central to their trip. Their plans are finalized and you should never have thought they would change that to accommodate you. It was fine to ask, but you should have known the answer was likely no. \n\nLet him go on the trip without guilt. It sounds like you have a lot of focusing to do so that you can advance your career. If you can't do that because you \"need his support\", than you have no business being in a relationship. It's great that we can support and have the support of our partners. But it should never be something that you are completely reliant on.", "YTA.  For many reasons, but first starting a text chain with his family with out checking with him first.", "YTA.  You want everyone else to change their plans and schedules for one person. You aren\u2019t married but you are showing your BF and the whole family what kind of person you are. A selfish self-centered person who isn\u2019t willing to listen to anyone else. \n\nI wish we spoke up about my BIL wife. Right now the whole family is feuding and the damage is irreparable. But after what she has put everyone through I welcome going NC with them. My other BIL says cut off the cancer.", "So join them \u201cduring\u201d\u2014 and u only vacation for three weeks instead of a month", "Unfortunately YTA as it is their trip which they planned and have worked their schedules around to have.  I do empathise with your logic and not wanting to miss part of a work opportunity.  Did you see if you could do the training session at another time or use a different media to learn the information?  Most good employers will be able to work around long term planned leave and training commitments.  I\u2019d take a step back and apologise to his family as long term it will be respected.", "Soft YTA, asking is fine and understandable, he said no from his also very understandable point of view. You should not have pushed his family, that\u2018s a bit of an overstepping of boundaries.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They've all been saving for it but when the global 'thing' happened they had to cancel. I've known about this trip since before we started dating when we were just friends. Once we were together for a while, he invited me to go too. I accepted.\r  \n\r  \nThe trip has been scheduled for later this year and we were supposed to be gone for a little over a month. I am up for promotion next year and to keep my chances high, it means a lot of travel and training for my job this year. One of the training sessions is during the trip. Obviously, I put my career first because better pay means more travel opportunities in the future. I was upset when I told him I wouldn't be able to make it and suggested that either we go by ourselves and then plan to go with his family in a couple of years or we talk to his family about rescheduling for next year. He said no because the time picked was already the time that worked best for everyone and they want to get a long overseas trip finished before their kids are older and they start taking more kid-friendly vacations. I could not get him to see my point of view regarding scheduling or how it's kind of cruddy to go on vacation for a month without the person you're talking about moving in with and marrying, plus I'll really need his support during that time.\r  \n\r  \nI think it's pretty reasonable to bring it up with his siblings so I created a group chat and explained the situation to them and how my talk with their brother went. I also thought that maybe if he heard my concerns from married people close to him he'd get the picture. His brother and sister pretty much repeated what he said about rescheduling and told me I should be alright with him going because I know how much it means to him and these plans predate his relationship with me. I accepted their no and that was that but I guess they did talk to him just not about rescheduling. He called me and was disappointed I \"went over his head\" to talk to his family like that and I had made myself look bad because he was now having to defend me to his family that I'm not controlling or want everyone to do things my way because of my decisions.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?\r\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019ve been on a family vacation without my fianc\u00e9 who I currently live with. My sister, who is married, went on the same family vacation without her husband. It\u2019s not \u201ccruddy\u201d because we go on plenty of other vacations together. Your behavior comes across as very controlling and disrespectful. I hope your bf has a lovely, well-deserved vacation with his family", "YTA, this isn\u2019t about you, you were never a central part.  You picked a job first, which is fine, but why would they pick your job over all their plans?  \n\nA lot if times the season picked for a trip is VERY specific for certain climate or activities.  Not to mention their own jobs, getting approved time off which for many is a months in advance thing.  Good grief zero consideration", "YTA.

The world does not revolve around you.", "You are a massive, massive asshole, and expecting a trip that's been planned for years to be rescheduled because of you is fucking ridiculous and if I were him would be a HUGE red flag telling me to look for an off ramp to the relationship.", "YTA I wouldn\u2019t even dare to make a group chat to ask this.

It would have been nice if you could have joined them but you made your choice and no they have zero reasons to wait for you. Get over yourself and bow out gracefully. Apologize to your bf for making this about you and your career.", "You can really think what you did was ok? YTA.", "YTA. It's a family trip that you're being included in - that doesn't mean you get to change major plans. It's hard enough to coordinate everyone that if everyone bumped it to one reason or another, no one would end up going.  What if one of them is up for a big promotion the next year? Should the trip just move again?", "Yikes on bikes indeed.  Also just wanted to point out something else OP said: \n\n>Obviously, I put my career first because better pay means more travel opportunities in the future.\n\nThis is not necessarily a true statement.  It is one way of thinking about the world, yes.  But A) 'putting your career first' in front of the other family's schedules is selfish, and B) this is 100% what workaholics say when they're trying to justify working instead of going on vacation.  \n\nIt sounds like it was a huge effort to get this many people's schedules aligned for this trip.  And OP's desire to work because of some vague opportunity for a future promotion does not sound like an emergency or requirement by any stretch of the imagination.  There's nothing wrong with using your vacation days to go on vacation.", "Hit the nail on the head with this comment!\n\nYTA - please see above as to why.", "YEP definitely TA these are Blinking neon red flags to expect them to change a trip they've had for years to accommodate her when she wasn't even considered to be an invitee until recently and then when her bf tells her exactly what he knows they'll say she decides to take her entitlement to another level by pushing for it anyway", "OP is a walking red flag.
