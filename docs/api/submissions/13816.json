{"id": 13816, "submission_id": "129klns", "title": "AITA for saying what I would do in my cousins position?", "selftext": "So my cousin T is gay and came out to his parents in the early 80s. They disowned him and didn\u2019t speak to him for close to twenty years. When his parents started getting older and needed help they went to their daughter who as they said \u201cwas all in to drugs and wouldn\u2019t help us\u201d. So they called T. T left his job in Texas and moved back home. He took care of his parents till his father died and still takes care of his mother. T was recently diagnosed with a very rare blood cancer and has been given a few months to live at most. My mother is devastated as she has always loved T and they have a brother sister relationship. I was invited over to Ts house with my mom and dad as well as my brother and his fianc\u00e9. I could tell T was in a stressful mood as I\u2019d be in his shoes but when he invited me to smoke some weed with him in his garage I joined. While we were getting stoned he started to tear up and cry. He is in his 60s and I\u2019ve never seen him cry as long as I\u2019ve known him and asked if he needed to vent. He did and I won\u2019t repeat what he said(I told my mom the same thing), he then asked me what I would do. \n\nNow I\u2019m 30 and T is 64 so I gave him my honest answer. I said, \u201c man I would put your mom in a home cause they only called you back here not to make amends but cause they needed to be taken care of and knew you would do it even though they hated you are gay. Thats something I couldn\u2019t forgive dude. Then after that I would sell this house, buy a nice car and go on a road trip and hopefully die in a more beautiful place than this shithole we call home. That\u2019s me man, so you gotta do you, I just would want to be in a happy place both in my mind, physically and literally.\u201d T stayed silent for a few minutes and I thought maybe I had over stepped as I said it without any emotion I just answered his question. He put his stash away and said we would be missed at dinner. At the end of the night on my way home my mother called me and asked why T was in a worse mood when we left. So I told her what I said and the gist of what happened in the garage without telling her what T told me when venting. \n\nShe called me a cold hearted bastard for saying something like that about her aunt and why would I say such a thing to a man who is dying and worrying about his old mother. I tried to explain my point of view but she hung up and I drove home. My dad told me that she apparently called T and apologized on my behalf and told him he needs to just process what is happening. My dad doesn\u2019t know what T said to my mom but she hung up in tears and no one has heard from T in a few days. My mom has been very cold to me and my brother said while he understands my view he wouldn\u2019t have said what I said. His fianc\u00e9 when told this looked and me and simply said \u201cwtf tuna\u201d. My dad is just dad he doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m right or wrong. But I\u2019m starting to wonder if I am an asshole for being honest with a dying man. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1680440432, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/129klns/aita_for_saying_what_i_would_do_in_my_cousins/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Frankly I think you\u2019ve got a really good point. If he\u2019s dying he shouldn\u2019t have to spend his last few years taking care of a woman who disowned him if he doesn\u2019t want to. I think she released him off that obligation by not talking to her son for twenty years.", "He asked and you answered and your answer was founded in compassion for him and his life. He\u2019s probably looking at the end and feeling a lot of feelings about the time he gave to people who treated him like shit. Maybe you\u2019re the only person in decades who has ever told him he doesn\u2019t have to care for people who were horrible to him and that realization is not sitting well. Ultimately, I think you are NTA and I agree with every word you shared after being asked for your thoughts. I hope your uncle follows your advice and spends his last days somewhere lovely because it\u2019s the bare minimum he deserves.", "NTA. You gave an honest answer. The its family card burned when they kicked him out. Didn't call to mend fences. Just needed someone to take care of them. Hope he takes your advice.", "NAH - the guy asked for your genuine opinion after he opened up and vented how he was feeling. You gave your honest opinion. I don\u2019t think that makes you an AH.", "NTA he doesn\u2019t owe his family shit if they disowned him for 20 years.", "NTA\n\nT is himself old and will die at a youger age than his parents.\n\nHe is alone and was a long time \"abonded .\nHe should enjoy his left time without burden and I hope happier.\n\nBeing a bigger person / but family in some momenrs is abuse of the victim", "NTA - You should have suggested a Porsche 911 to him. It's a beautiful car.", "NTA. You maybe could have said things in a less harsh way to your Cousin, but quite frankly he lived half his life without his hateful parents who only picked him back up when they needed something. He should take care of himself now and enjoy his last days without the stress of his unloving parent.", "He asked you answer. And yeah, he was generous to go at all to help them out. Now is the time for him to focus on himself. Your mom sounds like is making it about herself. She should have been clapping if he was going to not hang around to live his last days catering to somebody who is using him now because it\u2019s convenient.  You didn\u2019t lie to him about what you thought. NTA.  Shame on your mom.", "If you're an asshole I am to bc that's exactly what I would have told him NTA", "NTA. People shouldn\u2019t ask for an opinion if they\u2019re not prepared to hear any possible answer, regardless of how serious the topic is.", "NTA.  But man, you're one cold m.f.\n\nI think that T was looking either to vent or for some help in thinking through some solutions to what seems like an intractable problem: what to do if his parent outlives him.  Your answer was honest. But it forced him to face a very ugly truth about how his parents went no contact for two decades or more. Also, the solution may have been way too far out of the box for what he was looking for.\n\nIf it's not too late, call him and ask if you crossed a line with him.", "While you are NTA. please do understand that the generation they lived in and yours are in different era hence the negative reactions", "NTA. Keep in mind T has a lot to process right now. Give it a little time.", "NTA.  If T starts looking for good residential care *now* he can find something that he is comfortable with - hopefully his mother will be also.  What if he gets critically ill and passes away sooner than expected.  Who takes care of mom then? Who else knows where her financial records are located? insurance? special concerns?\n\nT may want to take care of this puzzle before he is bedridden.  Can you imagine him undergoing end-of-life care and also trying to find a place for his mom? Unless your mom plans to offer to care for T's mom, she has no right to inject her opinion into the situation.\n\nNext, I also agree that T needs to take sometime to enjoy his life as much as possible while he can.  Maybe you were more direct and blunt than other people would be, but honestly answered the question.  Personally I could have said the same exact thing.\n\nYou're a good and honest friend.", "Well if you are a cold hearted AH so am I.\n\nThe only think I think I might see differently than you is than I'm older than you and I wonder if he will beat himself up (emotionally not literally) for not being able to follow your advice if he decides he can't put his mother in a home.\n\nBut yeah, she deserves nothing less. \n\nNTA", "YTA. Not for what you said to T, but for what you said to your mother. It was completely unnecessary and likely to inflict distress. She was not responsible for T's parents' decisions nor for T's decisions. You dont always have to share every opinion or judgment with other people.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I just want to man to be happy in the last stretch before he kicks off.", "I really do as well he hasn\u2019t reached out to me personally but I hope he is processing it in a healthy way and takes my advice. I was fortunate to have parents that would be fine with me being gay/bi or whatever. T didn\u2019t and I think he deserves to be happy before the end. If no one hears from him today I\u2019ll call him on Monday and see how he is doing.", "I think he is more of a Mercedes guy haha. I should have told him whatever car he gets to get a convertible.", "This is exactly how I feel. I could\u2019ve worded what I said in a better way but we were both high and just answered his question without trying to tip toe around being polite I guess is how I would say it.", "I have been giving him space right now.

And really, the car being convertible should be a priority in the choice.", "NTA. Realistically he needs a solution to care for his mother after he\u2019s gone. He either places her now or someone else takes her on or places her later.  I don\u2019t see in practical terms how different what OP suggested is from the scenario above. Is the OPs mother willing to take in her Aunt?\n\nUnfortunately, unless there\u2019s serious family bucks or the house is already in his name, the asset is going to be claimed by the nursing home due to the 5 year look back. $15k per month eats up your life savings very quickly. Don\u2019t get his hopes up for that Porsche.", "NTA, don't let your family make you feel bad, T deserves to enjoy what's left of his life, his parents should have thought about that before disowning him. Yes thats his mother biologically, but she wasn't his mother emotionally and physically since she disowned him.", "NTA\n\nhe asked advice and honestly it may be that he had to face hard truths that still hurt him.", "NTA - you can't ask for an honest opinion and then be mad at it. WTF?!?! Especially when adding in the weed!\n\nEven if this comment was unsolicited it is true and I agree but it wasn't.", "NTA", "Bingo. Let call a spade a spade.
