He's trying to punish you by cutting contact, when in reality he's doing you a favor.", "NTA I\u2019m going to assume your father has a history of being verbally abusive\u2014even if you haven\u2019t realized it yet. It took me having a child of my own, and seeing that treatment towards my child to really see it. I\u2019ve gone no contact, in part, because of incidents like that.\n\nA seven year old is not a pathological liar-they\u2019re a child. Your brother needs to know if his child is being mistreated, and badmouthing both her and her mother like that is likely to cause long term mental health issues. Poor kid.\n\nYour dad sounds like a narcissist.", "NTA.\n\nYour Dad realized what he said was inappropriate and tried to backpedal, but it was too late. She's seven, and a grandparent announcing in front of/to a 7 year old they are on the naughty  list is unecessarily cruel. He 100% deserved the callout and he knew it, which was why he tried to cover his ass.\n\nAnd then to act like a young kid himself when he gets called on his shit? Hes just embarassed. Sucks to parent a parent, but there it is. He'll get over it.  \n\n\nEDIT\n\nAlso, I'm guessing if he is living with THEM and they aren't living with him, this situation somehow benefits him. He needs a serious sit down.", "NTA\n\nHe was being abusive and he knows he was being abusive because he tried to make a 7 year old keep the abuse a secret.", "NTA. Your dad knew what he said was wrong that's why he didn't want your brother to know.", "NTA\n\nYou did what a responsible, empathetic adult would do. \n\nYour father has some serious issues if he's talking about his 7 year old granddaughter this way to her face. \n\nDo what he asked and lose his number. I suspect it won't be a great loss.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Was he always like that? Anyway, he insulted a child, the child's mother and then tried to coerce you into \"keeping your mouth shut\". WTF?", "Good grief, is your Dad 8 years old? This is the crap 1st & 2nd graders pull.
