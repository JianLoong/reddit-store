She deserves to be in her home where she feels comfortable in her bed where she feels best. I am going to tell you this with the utmost importance. LEARN TO CREATE APPROPRIATE BOUNDARIES!!!

I think you need to set some ground rules and boundaries right now, because otherwise she might come up with other bullshit traditions like \"Maternal grandmother is the person who first cuddles the newborn baby\" \"Maternal grandmother is the person who chooses the baby's name.\" I'm sure your wife will be more comfortable in her own home afterwards. There's been a lot of stories on here where in-laws have come to stay with new parents ostensibly to 'help out' and instead expected to be waited on hand and foot, contributing nothing and just creating more work, so I'd have a think about whether you want them to visit and stay over, or just visit. \n\nIf you think she'd overstep boundaries, make sure that the delivery room staff are fully aware that MIL is not allowed in while your wife is in labour.

It feels like if you start letting MIL dictate how you raise your family from the moment of birth, that you\u2019ll be fighting battles with her the entire time you are raising your children. I would find it rather insulting to be told that, as one of the two parents, my feelings, input, and role was secondary to a person who is not one of the two parents to said baby. It\u2019s just as important for you to be there and bond with your baby as your wife. It\u2019s significantly less important (to me completely unimportant) that your MIL be involved in those first moments. Beyond that, you and your wife have a plan that you decided together. You don\u2019t have to let someone else change that.

Period.\n\n2) husband has the right to make medical decisions if wife for some reason can't.  Not wife's mom.\n\n3) baby can only stay at a house with a safe sleeping space for baby.  Non negotiable.\n\nHowever, having hands to just cook and do laundry and watch the baby while you sleep is valuable, so if wife doesn't want mom in the delivery room, but does want help, and their house has a safe crib or bassinet, offer to stay with them as a 'compromise'.

Many women want their mothers to also be there. She does not have a right to be there, but remember the people in the delivery room are meant to support your wife and should be of her choosing. Your wife gets the say here- you don't get to 'not allow' her mother. She needs to keep stress levels down as much as possible, and that means having who she wants with her. If both of you are allowed and she wants both of you, no reason to cause a fight. If it's just one person, I'd hope she'd rather have you anyway, but sometimes when someone is scared, they just want their mom, especially when she's already been through it.
