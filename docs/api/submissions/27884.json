Our kids are 7M and 5F. Now on to the main issue.\n\nIt's been awhile since I've spent any time with my friends. I miss going to clubs, partying and just living my life the I want to in general. I am aware of the fact that the situation changes when you have kids, but I feel like everyone deserves some off time once in awhile. Between the kids and my husband, I've hardly had any time to myself. \n\nAll this got me thinking of planning a getaway to Hawaii with my friend group sometime in the next months. Quite a few of them are down for it, and since those who agreed can afford the trip too, we decided to go ahead with our plans. We mutually decided to make it a 2 week long trip. \n\nNow, my husband had a pretty bad reaction when I told him about our plans. He called me selfish for taking 2 weeks off when 'I haven't had a single day for myself in months.' I told him no one's stopping him from doing so, had he planned any such vacation with his guy friends, I would never have interfered. He laughed in my face and reminded me of the time when he actually had done so, but I told him not to go since it wasn't fair to me. I was pretty annoyed at that point and reminded him the reason why I had refused. Our son was down with a cold and I felt like it would be better for my husband to be there as well, as it's his time to take care of the kids when he's home, and taking care of a sick child for 3 whole days wasn't something I thought I could or should have to do when he has a father as well. He told me that it would be impossible for him to take care of the kids for 2 whole weeks on his own on top of his job, and I was being a 'hypocrite' when it came to myself. I felt like he was blowing things way out of proportion and was being too controlling, so I told him I planned to take this trip regardless of what he feels about it, since I too deserve a break from him and the kids once in awhile.\n\nHowever, when I told one of my friends about our argument, she called me an asshole for dissmissing my husband's feelings like that, and maybe I should just postpone the trip to a time when he feels comfortable enough for me to go.

TWO WEEKS IN HAWAII?! Without your husband and kids?! \n\nSeveral things:\n\n1. Your husband is working 6 days a week to provide for your family. He deserves a break, too. And a child having a cold is no reason to make him cancel his plans, IMO. \n2. Yes, taking care of kids and a house is hard work. I\u2019m a SAHM and I get it. You deserve a break, but a two week beach vacation alone with the girls is a bit much when you have young kids and a husband working nonstop. Especially on short notice and without having all of your daily responsibilities covered. \n3. When was the last time you took a vacation alone with your husband? As a family?", "YTA. Not because you want time away, but for a plethora of other things. \n\nMaybe re-read your post until what you typed actually sinks into your head.  Your kid had a *cold* so you threw a shit fit over a **three-day trip** \u2026..because one of the kids had a *cold* while then telling your husband, 'I'm taking a ***-two-week trip-*** don't like it too bad so sad.'  You really are being a hypocrite, not to mention the lack of communication and planning for ***people that are supposed to be partners*** is pretty astounding", "YTA. This is a huge thing to just spring on someone with no warning. You are supposed to be a team, and you need to COMMUNICATE. If you feel overworked, fine, but you need to be an adult and talk about it with your husband. This is going to cause a ton of stress on your whole household, your children included.", "YTA\n\nThis is a Y-T-A BINGO:\n\n* made travel plans w/o his input on dates or duration and then *informed* him of the plan\n* hypocrisy\n* complete dismissal of your husband's thoughts and feelings on this\n* no mention of any consideration for covering the logistics you handle on the day to day \n* *TWO WEEKS?!*", "YTA, you can't just randomly check out of marital and parental responsibilities for weeks at a time and also a hypocrite for the fact that you think it's okay for you but wouldn't allow your husband the luxury. Very assholish to not even consider not going because of how he feels.\n\n\nI am not sorry to tell you this but unless you intend to abandon your family, the clubbing and party and carefree lifestyle gets put on hold when you have a family. Not saying you can't ever have a vacation or anything, but away from your family? That's fucked.", "YTA.  You absolutely *are* being a hypocrite.\n\nThat said, you're not wrong that you both deserve time away from your family.  A two-week trip might be a bit much when your kids are both so young, unless you can afford to hire a nanny during that time or make other arrangements to help your husband care for them while he's also working.  Surely you could start smaller, though?  Maybe you each get one Saturday a month to yourself and then see how that goes.", "YTA here. You interfered with your husband going away for \"3 whole days\" because one of your kids had a cold, and you think 2 weeks is nothing? Take 3 whole days yourself. In fact, take one day to yourself every week instead of trying to get everything you need all at once. You know as well as anyone that a lot can go down with a five year old and a seven year old over a two week period.", "YTA and a hypocritical one at that.\n\nYou expect to go away for 2 weeks an for your husband to have to take 2 weekd holiday to look after the kids after you refused to lethim go away for for s few days.\n\nYou are bloody selfish\n\nAlso If you are a SAHM i take it you are expecting your husband to pay as well.\n\nI feel sorry for you husband being married to you.", "YTA - And are absolutely the hypocrite your husband called you out as. It's one thing to plan a 3-4 day girls trip, but two weeks is not okay. Especially when your PARTNER does not agree. This is not how marriage, or co-parenting, works. When you have children, you don't get to be this selfish anymore. You absolutely deserve some time to yourself, but not two weeks thousands of miles from your children.", "The mental gymnastics people go through to convince themselves they aren't being an asshole...\n\n\nYTA", "YTA. What an outrageous thing to do! 2 WEEKS in Ha-fucking-waii? A need-a-break girls' trip is a weekend, for crying out loud. You are not single. You have massive responsibilities. So does husband. Get it together, OP. You're acting like a spoiled \"why, why?\" teenager.", "100% YTA\n\n>I told him no one's stopping him from doing so, had he planned any such vacation with his guy friends, I would never have interfered.  \n>  \n>and reminded me of the time when he actually had done so, but I told him not to go since it wasn't fair to me.  \n>  \n>taking care of a sick child for 3 whole days wasn't something I thought I could or should have to do  \n>  \n>He told me that it would be impossible for him to take care of the kids for 2 whole weeks on his own on top of his job, and I was being a 'hypocrite' when it came to myself. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDid you ever think that perhaps one of you kids could fall ill while you're away for **2 whole weeks**? Is it not enough that your husband works 6 days a week to provide for your family? Now he has to finance your vacation while getting stuck with doing literally everything and the one time he planned to get away you vetoed it using the kids as an excuse. \n\nA weekend away I could understand, even in these circumstances, as everyone does need a break - but you're not even listening to your husband here. You are dismissing his **VERY VALID AND COMPLETELY LOGICAL** points as to why he is upset, as \"he's overacting\". \n\nYou are a massive asshole.", "YTA\n\nI mean\u2026. A two week trip almost feels like you\u2019re using your friends just to gaslight him. \n\nI mean\u2026 did you work out a plan for while you\u2019re gone (like having his or your parents help while he is at work)?", "So you said no to your husband because your son was sick with a cold. So he wasn't dying and you told, husband he couldn't go off with his friends. But you want to do a 2 week girls trip to Hawaii...  You planning on coming home if one of them gets a cold or a sore throat. Because you should be caring for them as he shouldn't be doing it alone as your mum.\n\n\nYTA - a break is at a push a few days at a spar, not a 2 week trip out of state\n\nIf you want more time away from them get a job, so he can work less hours and you get time away from the kids and husband.", "Yta. So if a kid gets unwell you're gunna cancel ey? Thought not. \n\nA months notice is NOT enough either when you're going away for 2 whole weeks. I would not know where to start trying to find childcare for all that time on such short notice. \n\nStart of small not go all out.", "YTA for planning a trip without discussing it with your partner, making it TWO WEEKS LONG, and seemingly not presenting a suggested plan for childcare/etc.\n\nI'm a SAHM of two kids, 7 and 10, and when I want to go on vacation sans partner and kids I tell him what I'm thinking, let him know how I think we can cover childcare at the times that I'm with them and he's at work, and ask him what he thinks. If it's not time-bound (ie, not for a concert or a birthday, etc, but just want to visit a friend) I also ask when would be a good time based on his work schedule. When possible I try to go during the week, so that the kids are at school most of the day.\n\nAnd two weeks is a LONG time to solo parent. People can do it when necessary, but I wouldn't want to put that level of stress on my partner unless it was something that really had to be that long.\n\nLook, I 100% get wanting time away from kids and husband!  I do too, and when I'm able to do it it's wonderful and refreshing and I come back a better mother and wife.  But parenting is a partnership, and the way that you talked about it here you informed him rather than shared what you're thinking about and used it as a starting point for a discussion. THAT'S the problem.", "YTA! This is like a YTA lottery. \nWhy you may ask?\n\n\n1) Two weeks at a stretch is way -way too much even for a SAHM.\n\n\n2) When your husband who works and provides you with the luxury of being a SAHM asked for 3 whole days of vacation you denied it, why because your child had a cold? A common cold, really?\n\n\n3) You are not wrong for wanting some time for yourself but you went about it in the wrong way. \n\n\n4) Your husband does take care of the kids while he is home, he too has a right to do something for his sanity, a right which is denied to him.\n\n\n5) Why tell your husband about the trip, if you were going to dismiss his concerns anyway.\n\n\n6) Mothers and parents regardless of the gender take care of their children, you can't really use that as an excuse to take time off.\n \n\n7) A more sensible option would have been a weekend or 3-5 days Max or taking time off every alternate weekend.", "YTA. Such a hypocrite. He can\u2019t go away for three days when your son has a cold? But you can take two weeks in Hawaii? I\u2019m assuming you will not run home immediately if Junior gets the sniffles.", "He works 6 days a week and you are stay at home mom for two school age children, your sense of entitlement is bewildering.", "You're not an AH for wanting time to yourself. But YTA for planning a *two-week* trip, apparently without talking to your husband first, and then dismissing his very valid feelings about it.", "YTA -\n\nThe fact that you just presented him with this instead of having a conversation about it makes you TA. You planned an entire TWO WEEK trip without looping your husband in. That\u2019s ridiculous. He\u2019s the one who has to manage in your absence, so he should have been in on this from the start.\n\nAnd then you clearly have a rules for me, not for thee thing going on. You wouldn\u2019t let him go for\u2026 three days\u2026 and now you want to go for fourteen? That does, in fact, make you a hypocrite.\n\nBoth of you deserve time to yourselves, but this isn\u2019t the way to go about it.", "YTA big time. Also incredibly hypocritical and selfish. You're expecting him to fund an extremely expensive two week trip for you to go clubbing even though you made him cancel a 3-day trip because of a common cold. Your kids are in school now so why can't you get a job?\n\nIt's pretty bad when an almighty SAHM is getting this many YTAs in this sub.", "bro YTA. you need to work as a team and communicate better.", "YTA. Not only for being a hypocrite but three days is nothing compared to 2 whole weeks.", "Wow. You're a piece of work. \"I know I did exactly what I'm telling you not to do but forget about that because that was different.\" It's not. You're a hypocrite and YTA. \n\n\nDo you even love your husband? What is wrong with you? Spoiled, hypocritical AH.", "YTA\n\nI'm expecting a post about \"I went on a 2 week trip to Hawaii with  my friends because I needed time away from my kids and husband, even though I didn't let my husband have a 3 day trip. I got back from Hawaii and the locks have been changed. What do I do?\"\n\nThat's what needs to happen. You can't be selfish in a marriage. The marriage won't last that way. You are a complete selfish narcissistic hypocrite. You are a mom. You can't take care of your sick child for a few days? Really?\n\nWho is paying for this trip? You or hubby? If it's from money you have in a fun money account that might be something, but if you expect hubby's money to pay for your trip, then you need to rethink shit. Get a job if you need time away from hubby and kids. You yourself said that they are in school from 8-2. GET A JOB.", "YTA. If one of your children gets sick just before you\u2019re supposed to go on this trip, will you cancel so that you can stay home and co-parent, like you expected your husband to? It doesn\u2019t sound like it, or that you\u2019d be willing to fly home if one of your kids got sick when you\u2019re on this two week trip. So you\u2019re not willing to reciprocate, not really \u2014 you think that your breaks are yours, no matter what, and your husband is supposed to supply them. You need to come up with something more manageable that can be reciprocated, including in the event of routine minor illness.", "YTA and a hypocrite.", "YTA \n\nI am a Stay At Home Mum too and I understand you want to get away but you ought to have spoken with your husband before you agreed with your friends that you would be gone for two weeks! Also you did shoot down his request for a break too, that does not put you in a strong bargaining position.   \nI need a break away too but I ask for a day or a weekend not two weeks and even then I don't just go off,  not without talking to my husband and checking calendars and organising everything beforehand.   \nI do understand you feeling burned out but the way you went about this was completely back to front.   \nMy husband has friends he goes motorcycling with and believe me it is an act of Parliament would be passed faster than  to organise the trip.    \nI could not just go on a fortnight's holiday without consulting with my husband and I would have to plan in months in advance.", "Yta-   I was soooooo rooting for you, I really wanted to give N A H,   But two weeks?  To hawawii? In a months time? Without discussing with him first?   AND After you vetoed his 3 day trip for a cold?   Yta for that anyway! \n\nI mean come on, I\u2019m sympathetic and sure you both need some you time, but you need to support each other, make it feasible and work for both of you. Discuss it first and agree something that gives you both time.", "YTA. \n\nOkay so your husband asked for three days away and you said no because your kid had a COLD? A freaking cold? You couldn't handle that? \n\nAnd now you want to leave to Hawaii for TWO WEEKS without your husband or kids, and he's somehow supposed to take care of everything at home while working six days a week? \n\nIt's fair to want time away as a SAHM but two weeks is ridiculous. Especially when you don't give your husband the same thing in return. He's working too and taking care of the kids, when does he get a break?\n\nEdit: love OPs replies... \n\n>1. I just felt like it was unfair for him to expect me to take care of our son on my own while he himself was off enjoying his vacation.\n\nYou taking care of your kid for three days versus him doing it for two weeks? LOL\n\n>2. Me and my girls plan to get absolutely stoned and drink ourselves 'to death' all two weeks lmao, something we haven't had the opportunity to do as a group in ages. That's why we decided on a 2 week long trip, so we won't feel like we missed out on things\n\nYou have some issues if you need two weeks to get completely obliterated with your friends. You can get drunk over a weekend somewhere much closer and cheaper. Grow up. How would you react if your husband went to Vegas for two weeks?", "YTA - you set a stupid precident when you didnt let him go in past. 2 weeks your kids could easily get a cold during that time (not that i agree both parents need 2 be there.)\n\n2 weeks is pretty long and definitly need to plan it out but havong family or friends help it should be doable but after you already said no to his past trip rly no way around getting that thrpwn back at yah.", "So you whinge and moan when he wanted a 3 day trip but you're entitled to a 2 week trip just because?? You're selfish", "YTA. Sounds like you regret the position you find yourself in from getting married and having kids young and would rather get hammered and party.", "YTA. I'm so confused because I don't know anyone whose every actually met children who thinks a 5 year old can go 2 weeks without getting a cold. So you'll be leaving him with a sick kid at some point, which you refused to let him do to you.\n\nIn any case 2 weeks is a long time. If you asked for 3 days, maybe 5, and he had taken a similar trip or was able to plan one if he was interested, that would be reasonable and it sounds like your husband would be up for that. If you wanted to go out one night every other week (and not be so hungover you can't help care for the kids the next day) while he had one night to himself also, that would be a reasonable way to spend time with your friends.", "YTA.\n\nYeah\u2026I don\u2019t know what you were expecting with this post. But this is ridiculous. A 2 week trip to Hawaii to get stoned and drunk while your husband shoulders all the responsibilities of childcare. For 2 weeks. His trip that you made him cancel was only for 3 days. I honestly don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s opinion matters to you and you\u2019ll do what you want anyways, so I\u2019ll just give you this piece of advice: You do this, and it will cause resentment in your marriage.

It is understandable that you want some time away from husband and kids, but that usually means the occasional night out with the girls. Maybe even a weekend when he is home. But to take off alone for 2 weeks is selfish. It is something we might all dream of but most of us postpone until the kids are older. \n\nDoes your husband have a mother or someone else who could look after the kids while he is at work? His work hours probably don't allow for him to get kids ready for, or to transport them to and from school. He may not be home enough to prepare meals. Your household routine is already well established and it would not be easy to have this thrown at him overnight.", "YTA. You completely blew off your husbands feelings and opinions after refusing him a similar trip and you plan on leaving for two weeks. You accuse him of being controlling while saying you are taking the trip regardless of what he thinks. Everyone does deserve time once in a while but you are gong about this in a really bad way.\n\nEdited to add: Your kids are in school every day from 8-2 and, according to you, your husband takes care of them when he is home. You get all kinds of time that you choose how to spend.", "YTA. Regardless of your comments that you didn\u2019t sprint it on your husband you did spring this on him. The thing to do would\u2019ve been to say I\u2019m thinking of planning a trip with my friends to Hawaii. Do you have a problem with this? Do you mind if we go for two weeks? And you should\u2019ve had a plan for who was going to help take care of the kids and not make him figure it out. If you were going for a week, it probably wouldn\u2019t be as bad but you want to go for two weeks. And what are your kids going to think about you being gone for two whole weeks that you just don\u2019t like them anymore and you want to be away from them? If you plan to be stoned and drunk the entire time when do you plan to call home and talk to your children? You are married with kids you are no longer single plans don\u2019t go like they used to. There\u2019s two of you in the marriage you have to discuss the trip before you plan it.", "YTA - 2 weeks is ridiculous. Especially when you wouldn\u2019t even let him do 3 days. What happens if one of the kiddos gets sick while you are away? You are coming home, right? Since it\u2019s not fair to have to parent a sick kid alone? No of course you aren\u2019t.\n\nYou are selfish and if you take this trip you are going to be divorced", "YTA. All parents, whether stay-at-home or those with a job they go to, want and need some time to decompress. And they should get to. But what you don\u2019t get to do is make a plan for a 2-week vacation and just spring it on your husband, especially when you threw a fit about taking care of your kids on your own for only three days. Your son had a cold; you would have been fine. To expect your husband to work 6 days a week and take care of the kids alone for TWO WEEKS when you didn\u2019t even discuss it with him is extremely hypocritical in light of you not wanting him to leave for only a few days. Be prepared to stay home if one of the kids ends up getting a cold again. If you forced him to stay home that time, it\u2019s only fair that you stay home if it happens again. And don\u2019t say \u201cbUt I dEsErVe A vAcAtIoN!\u201d You don\u2019t think he does too? You\u2019re supposed to be partners. Act like it. Figure out a way to take a little time away that works for BOTH of you, and make sure he gets the same.", "YTA and a hypocrite! \n\nSo you haven\u2019t allowed your husband to do so, you are leaving for 2 weeks with no plans for your family, and spend family funds to do so. \n\nWhat do you expect? That he doesn\u2019t work for 2 weeks? And your kids\u2019 feelings?", "YTA totally. But not for needing time away.  Because you are a hypocrite", "YTA. I'm not even gonna get into it with you, but you are.", "YTA... and selfish to boot. You wouldnt let him go for 3 days cuz your baby had a cold and you \"didnt think you could or should do it alone\" like WTAF. You CHOSE to be a mom. That night life is gone. And 2 weeks are you kidding me so basically f him and the kids you out for 2 weeks. It should be at best 4-5 days. Again you CHOSE to have children and you cant just roll out for 2 weeks and think thats ok cuz its not! If you dont want to be a SAH momma go get a job and put them in daycare. So your husband is also supposed to take 2 weeks off of work since your home the kids arent in daycare so whos going to look after them when hes at work. But it kinda sounds like you dont care. So maybe you should just leave your husband and kids altogether since you care so much about clubs partying and 2 week vacations. TF is wrong with you!!!", "Absolutely YTA.  Not for wanting to spend time with friends (completely reasonable and needed), but for wanting to do it for 2 weeks when you have kids and being a hypocrite about your husband wanting to do a guys trip\n\nWe have a friend group of 6 families.  We do different guys, ladies, and couples trips.  The difference is the guys or ladies trips are normally 3-4 days as a long weekend.  Even though we could all afford it, none of would even think about doing a guys or ladies trip to Hawaii for 2 weeks.", "YTA Sounds like you didn\u2019t realize that part of your life is over. At least the partying and clubbing. You can\u2019t have it all especially if you don\u2019t have a job and it\u2019s essentially your husband having to pay for this. Having the desire doesn\u2019t make you an asshole, but not being able to see reality and expecting a trip with friends to be it does. If we were to ignore all of this , your son having a cold is such a bullshit excuse so naw he\u2019s entitled to reject your plans just like you did his.", "YTA. There's a big difference between a night out on the town with the girls and a two week vacation to Hawaii. If a break is what you need, then you need to be communicating with your husband and making realistic plans as a couple. You clearly just expect the sole breadwinner to stop everything so you can run away on an expensive trip for two weeks without any consideration of the logistics, finances, or what's best for your family. If you're a SAHM, and no side gig or bringing in any income, then you need to be contributing somewhat if you want a vacation. He deserves a break too. It's not all about you.", "YTA That is a huge amount of time to expect your husband to take over for, in addition to his job. Yes, being a mom is the hardest damn job, but you can\u2019t call in sick and take vacation like you can with most other jobs. \n\nTo have planned this without talking to your husband is horrible. Do you do this often?", "YTA. A better approach would have been to sit down and discuss the idea of taking a trip with your friends before you planned it out and started making group plans. \n\nAlso 2 weeks away to Hawaii is insane on a single income household. You need to start with like a weekend spa retreat instead. \n\nAlso you\u2019re being incredibly hypocritical for giving him a bunch of grief over his trip while you yourself are planning a 2 week excursion to basically go comatose from drugs and alcohol. \n\nIf my wife presented this to me I would 100% shoot the idea down as well.", "YTA and from how you describe your plans this is nothing more than 2 weeks to step out of your marriage to pretend and act like you are single.", "YTA. And I hope he divorce you.", "YTA definitely. He wanted to go away for 3 days! You don't have a job so there was nothing actually stopping you from taking care if the kids even if one was sick but you want to leave him alone with 2 under 10s and his job for 2 WEEKS?!?!?! you're such a massive hypocrite it's way more unfair for you to do that then what he wanted to do. If you went on a trip for maybe like 4-5 days it'd be acceptable but not _2 weeks_!", "YTA. Your son had a cold so you told your husband he couldn\u2019t go away? Wow. And you told your husband about this after it was a done deal. Did you arrange after school care for your kids when you are away?\n\nSide note- aren\u2019t your kids in school all day so how do you have no time to do some things you want to do?", "Fixed your title for you:\n\nAITA for planning and booking a two week vacation without my family, without discussing with my husband first, and after denying him the same type of trip.\n\nGirls trips are 3 days long, not 2 weeks. I suggest you spend the Hawaii money on peronal counseling.", "Dude YTA. Big time. You're also a hypocrite. You told your husband that he couldn't go away for a single weekend because you apparently can't take care of a kid who has a case of the sniffles and now you expect him to take care of them for 2 whole weeks while you get drunk and stoned for 2 weeks. Grow the f*** up. You give up certain things when you choose to become a parent and partying for days/weeks at a time is one of those things. You chose to marry and have kids young. Time to live with the consequences of your choices. You're just jealous because your friends are still childless and still have freedom. If you go on this trip and abandon your family for 2 weeks, don't expect to have a husband when you get home.", "YTA. If you want to take a girls trip vacay you need to let your husband plan a trip first since you canceled his last one. The fact you can\u2019t see how this is the exact same situation is baffling.", "Omg YTA! A two week vacation?? You're completely delusional and selfish. A long weekend is what you get now, you made this choice when you had kids. It's completely laughable that you also don't think your kids will not be overwhelming or possibly get sick during this time. Your husband needs a break too. Just because he's not at home doesn't mean he doesn't feel the burden of responsibility for life the way you do. Actually he feels it worse than you do because you're a complete YTA for this trip", "YTA for multiple reasons: 1) it sounds like you didn't discuss this trip with your husband first before booking it, 2) he works 6 days a week supporting your family while you are a SAHM, when does he get his rest? 3) you shut down his trip with friends and now you think he should bend over for you to go on this trip? 4) your logic around why you wouldn't let him go could easily happen to him. What if one of the kids gets sick while you're away? He would not only be taking care of a sick kid by himself (which according to you is impossible) but be missing work at the same time. 5) for most people, a \"break\" from your kids/spouse is, like, a weekend away or something, you think 2 whole weeks is appropriate? Good lord. You come off sounding like an entitled, spoiled brat and your husband is right, you are definitely being a hypocrite.", "YTA. He pulled the receipts on you, and you deflected. He's 100% right, and you're thinking of only yourself. \nThere's nothing wrong with taking a day off here and there, but two weeks? You're being ridiculous.", "YTA. \n\nIt sounds like you're exhausted, Momma, and I agree that you deserve a break.  But start small!  Try doing something short term (maybe a weekend) and lower cost first.", "Yta, you stopped him, and now you want 2 weeks of vacation without contributing to finances. You just want to remove single life I don't blame him for being upset.", "YTA. Two weeks is too long. One week is acceptable. Grow up and compromise.", "YTA. Two weeks is an incredibly long time for anyone to be solely responsible for kids, and you're expecting your husband to be OK with it when he's also literally not at home 40 hours a week.\n\nYou also told him he couldn't go on a 3-day trip. If one of your kids gets the sniffles before your flight, are you going to cancel? Are you helping your husband plan two weeks away from the family sometime in the very near future?", "YTA you vetoed his trip because the kid had a cold.  \n\nI think you should have time to yourself, absolutely.  2 weeks in Hawaii is a LOT though, both for time and expense.  If you want to do it, you should be arranging for help for your husband, if you are a sahm and he works outside the home, he's not going to be able to do both.  Enlist a family member, hire a nanny, etc.", "YTA. Try maybe a weekend or a night out first. And you\u2019re being a hypocrite. He couldn\u2019t leave for three days cuz it\u2019s unfair for you to handle the sick child alone but he should handle both alone for 2 weeks\u2026 what if one gets sick are you cancelling? Your poor husband", "So it wasn\u2019t ok for him to go because you didn\u2019t think you could take care of kid(s) for THREE days but yet you expect him to take care of them for TWO WEEKS while working 6 days a week?

YTA", "YTA a very selfish mom", "YTA. Two weeks?!?!

YTA! \nIf it was for a weekend trip then it would been another issue..", "YTA.", "Yta big time.", "Yeesh... clubbing and partying at almost 30 with two kids? \n\nJust that in a vacuum is a problem. Having personal space or leisure time is appropriate and healthy. But when I hear the grouping of clubs and party, that's a red flag right there. If either side wants to do this, it's a red flag.", "YTA and you know it. Why bother asking us? You know you\u2019re at fault here.\nYou are taking a 2 week trip. When you didn\u2019t let your spouse take even a weekend off due to a child having a cold? \nPlus he works 6 days a week so not like he\u2019s out there partying while you are at home. \nYour kids are now 7 and 5 probably going to school full time and you are bored.\nGet a part time job to combat the boredom and that will help your husband to get some much needed rest. \nAnd clubbing and partying ?? Are you a teen ? Jeez", "YTA. For reasons you clearly outlined in your own post.", "2 weeks!?! Without making sure he was chill with it? That\u2019s nutz", "Also, what makes you think your kids will be ok with you gone for 2 weeks?

YTA for so many reasons. \n\nIt\u2019s fine to want time away for a few hours or a day, but TWO WEEKS? Also, why did you discuss this with your friends before discussing it with your husband?

Luckily others have already said it all.", "It's like once every month or two that there is a rash of obviously fake as hell, rage bait posts and I'm just really curious if it is just one person with WAY too much time on their hands doing all of them or if there is some kind of weird Reddit Society that meets and plans this shit out. Either way, try harder to make it less obvious.", "This feels like a rage-bait post.

We all need breaks from time to time, but 2 weeks is excessive. Your husband works 6 days a week. Assuming your kids are in school 5 days per week that means this trip will have the added expense of before/after school care, and one full day with a sitter. Maybe try just a weekend trip first, but, if you're going to do that, your husband gets to go on a weekend trip as well. You can't expect him to be held to a different standard than you are. Also, you mentioned you're a sahm. Do you work from home/have your own source of income or did you just walk up to your husband and tell him you're spending money he earned for the household on a 2 week trip and he can kick rocks? He'd be entitled to his opinion and hurt feelings either way, but if you're a single income family that is such a huge financial choice to make without consulting him. I think you both need to sit down and figure out when you could do weekends away for the sake of both of you getting a well needed break. Maybe also consider a weekend away together without the kids and spend some alone time working on those communication skills", "YTA- I understand needing time off. You aren\u2019t the asshole for that. But you are in how you did it. You should have spoken to your husband first and figured out a timeline. And then talked to your friends. Plus keeping him home from a trip because a kid has a cold is childish. Find a compromise.", "YTA - You made this judgement too easy.", "SAHM here. YTA. If you need time away from the kids (which is reasonable) then plan a weekend away or a long weekend. Your husband should get the same at a different date. As the kids get a little older, you can extend that time to a week. A two week trip is a LOT to put on your spouse. I wouldn't do that with kids this age, unless it was a family emergency or something.

I wouldn't blame the guy.", "YTA - 2 weeks is a very long time to solo parent when you are not used to it.

The kid could get sick during that time alone!", "YTA.  Needing time to yourself is completely understandable.

There is no off time or breaks.

Two weeks is a long time but a compromise of a shorter break would probably not meet so much resistance so that makes YTA. Equally your husband not recognising that being a SAHM is a full time job and quite isolating in itself and you need some time away makes him TA. The biggest issue though and why ESH is because the art of communication has been lost. You need to sit down and talk to your husband and find some middle ground.

You are a relatively young mom, and you're stuck with not one, but TWO kids all day every day while even though your husband is working hard, he is (seemingly) blissfully unaware of all the work you have to do as a sahm. You not allowing him to go on the trip since your child was sick makes perfect sense, and I personally don't know why he would think it was good to go in the first place. However, you can't expect him take care of the children by himself when they're so young and when he has a full-time job.

I tend to be frugal and put everyone else first so my spouse was like, babe you work hard and make good money, you can afford to get yourself the machine you want if this hobby is how you want to spend your time and if you later want to sell it, you know if holds it's value as a used item.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese are the kinds of conversation OP should be having with her spouse.", "I can\u2019t even blame it on age as I\u2019ve seen plenty of 40-50 yr pulling selfish AH moves then wonder why their relationship is in the toilet. \n\nIt\u2019s like they are all shocked you have to communicate in a healthy manner to maintain a relationship.", "As I said in another comment. We keep our finances separate but we still have an agreement to discuss purchases over 1k. \n\nUsually, that discussion results in one of us encouraging the other to do the thing since neither of us are big spenders but occasionally it\u2019s resulted in talking each other out of a rash impulse buy. \n\nIronically enough the topic of a solo vacation recently came up. Both my parents died this year right before my birthday and it made my spouse think about how old his mom is getting and he wanted to go see her. Only I can\u2019t take the time off that month. But I whole heartedly encouraged him to go without me and hug his mom for me. But we talked about it. He didn\u2019t just go \u201coh hey, my flight leaves on x date see you in two weeks.\n\nWho does that?", "This is a classic situation of why I don't really get why people continue to stay home after the kids are in school. Go. Leave your house. Get a life. Do something. \n\nIt's way better for everyone's sanity.\n\nI feel like I see more SAHMs with older kids who are miserable and acting like this than any other parent.", "She also says the kids are his obligation when he gets home. So the kids are at school/out for much of his time at work. During which she does what exactly?\n\nAnd when he gets home, he has to take care of them too. This woman isn't overworked, at all.", "Yeh 2 weeks and she's saying her friends are going too. I find it very hard to believe 1 could even get that time off. High high probability it's some dude she's planning with.", "Yeah and it doesn\u2019t sound like she works\u2026 not that being a SAHM isn\u2019t work (it is). It\u2019s just a privilege that very few people can afford these days and is certainly an economic advantage for any family that can afford it.", "She's not overworked, she just wants attention", "Sounds like OP will need a STD panel on her way back home \ud83e\udd23", "I don\u2019t have kids. I can\u2019t even imagine a two week *vacation*. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had one in my life, besides visiting family.", "NINE!", "You need 2 weeks in Hawaii!!!", "That's how I read it too.

Work less? absolutely the fuck not, then we'd need to use MY money for the house and that's a no from me dawg, this is my fun vacation money\"  \n\n\nnot to fucking mention even if she funded the trip herself she is still leaving her kids with someone who works 6 days a week and is then suddenly expected to pick his kids up directly after and go into dad mode until theys leep. that's fucked up asshole behavior no matter who funds the fuckint rip  \n\n\n  \nit's not just one thing here that makes her an asshole, not just a single thing you can change that would make OP not an asshole. it's like 10 different factors from her forcing him to work OT to her doing nothing all day to her forbidding him from going on a trip to her not working to her entire outlook to her not telling him. her getting a job to pay for the trip would not change a single thing in the judgement here. she's an asshole through and through. she's such an asshole she doesn't have a regular doctor, she goes right to a proctologist", "For TWO weeks?!! Jesus Tap Dancing Christ!", "Yup the vetoing of her husband's trip because her kid had a cold rubs me the wrong way. As a single parent I've had to nurse my child from colds, strep throat, dislocated elbow and COVID just this year alone on top of running the house and studying full time.", "And her own only thoughts are drinking and doing drugs.", "That's what I was thinking. It's a matter of what is reasonable. A SAHM deserves a little friend time and a chance to recharge and be herself again. A dinner with friends. A girl's night. Spa day. Maybe even a weekend thing to a nearby relaxing spot. Hubby should even be seeing to it that she gets those things. But 2 weeks in Hawaii? No, that's not reasonable.", "I'm also pretty sure that the husband could have come back pretty quickly in case of an emergency. OP will be at least a six hour flight away.", "You forgot that it's his turn to watch the kids when he is off work... Poor bastard doesn't get any daily rest!", "But if her kids are in school all day, when is HER time with the kids? Other than that 6th day when husband is working. Just wondering. She sounds like a joy.", "This is pretty common for families where one parent stays home. I haven't really heard it laid out as \"it's his time with the kids\" like they are on some kind of formal shift arrangement (which makes me wonder how stable their marriage is, generally). But yeah, when my partner was a SAHP I would try to do more hands on stuff with the kid when I got home, to give him a break. When our kid was a baby, late night wakeups and any diaper change that happened after I got home was my territory. Since little kid go to bed early, we're talking about like 2 hours after work, max. It's my kid. Hanging out with him for a couple hours per day is the least I can do.\n\nEven now I like to do something just me and the kid to give my partner time to recharge, despite the fact that we both work now.", "Dad works 6 days a week, so there\u2019s a day each weekend when they\u2019re out of school and he\u2019s at work. Also depending on what time school lets out, he may need to adjust his schedule to get them (most schools let out before 5pm when he gets off work)", "Right?! I was loosely on her side when it sounded like she wanted a night out or a weekend alone. But just the childcare requires massive forethought.\n\nI'm very sorry to hear about your parents. I'm glad your spouse is able to take the time to see his, but sorry that it came from such a loss.", "Normally I would think that\u2019s a ridiculous thing to say, but given how much she clearly resents her husband\u2026", "Jesus what did you spend $5k on? I\u2019m about $4k into my mid October 6 day vacation in maui but that\u2019s including AirBnb, flights, car and snorkeling trips.

Kids get colds every other day. And husband works 6 days a week. Did she even try to find someone to help with childcare before she told him what she was doing?", "She also talks about how it's his job to take care of the kids when he comes home. So he works 6 days and then takes much of the childcare too as soon as he gets home as well?", ">Especially with talking about missing going clubbing...\n\nI really don't understand how she can't make time for clubbing every now and again? I'm a SAHM, part time job (my hubby is full time and I work while the kiddies are in daycare/school), study, run a small (literally tiny!) business and still make time every month to go our with my friends... we go dancing, to dinners, the movies etc.", "For me anybody that actually wants to go clubbing over the age of 25 is a walking red flag to me. I've always hated clubs with a passion, but now I'm nearing 30 I can't even tolerate them anymore.", "When I got burned out, I'd leave the kids with hubbie at 5AM and spend the morning fishing.

She presumably gets a big break from them for like 7-8 hours a day", "Same\u2026 but the gross entitlement and then the topper of it bro g a drunken drug fest. \n\nAnd thank you. No one prepares you for aging parents\u2026 my dad was end stage dementia. It was past time. My mom just couldn\u2019t be without him and passed in her sleep. Together for 55yrs.

Close together after we are old and declining sounds like a pretty good life.", "Even Breathing in Hawaii is expensive \ud83e\udd72", "Not necessarily. A lot of what a SAHP does can be outsourced with two incomes. Daycare means anywhere from 3/4 (once in school) and 9 (before school age) hours of childcare that neither parent does. It also means that the kids are not making a mess in the house that needs to be cleaned up. Depending on income levels, hiring cleaners and yard workers become an option. \n\nNot saying any of that applies here, but in general.", "TRUE DAT !
