I lived in an area with league A and played for a while before retiring into reffing full time for many years. I moved about an hour away for work/family and started volunteering for league B.\n\nJust to clarify- referees and non skating officials are not paid in roller derby, it\u2019s all volunteer- and you need 7 refs and about a dozen non skating volunteers to run a bout (game).\n\nAlmost immediately, I noticed there were issues with how league B treated their volunteers. In most derby leagues, officials and volunteers are included in recruiting, training, and the community. \n\nAfter two seasons of volunteering, I finally gave up. I had asked several times for them to consider showing appreciation to the volunteers by inviting them to community events, including them in decision making, helping offset costs for transportation to games (refs pay for their own gas to the games, sometimes as far as 8 hours one way, plus accommodations).  I spoke to the other volunteers, and apparently league B has been through several waves of volunteers because of their poor treatment and opinions of volunteers and officials. \n\nLeague B decided that they would prefer officials and volunteers have to pay them, the league, to volunteer, and began implementing this system. They rejected all requests. So 4-5 officials quit with official resignation letters and we\u2019ve all gone back to league A, who already provided all this basic stuff to their volunteers.\n\nProblem solved right? Wrong. Then covid hit. Leagues are finally starting to rebuild- including League B. \n\nEarlier this year, they were supposed to play league A, but upon finding out that I was the head official (I\u2019m almost always the head official in this area- not because I\u2019m the best, but because I\u2019m the only who gets getting sucked in to do the work), they informed league A that they would rather cancel the game. They blame me for several of their volunteers quitting, and those volunteers did ALL the work for the league. \n\nNow, a year after that, they are trying to put on several games in a day and are trying to recruit referees. I have declined to volunteer, as well as all the referees who were around at the time. I\u2019ve been approached by some newer refs about the games, as they noted I wasn\u2019t organizing the officials, so I told them the truth about why I wasn\u2019t volunteering and they declined to help as well. \n\nNow I\u2019m being called an AH, because there are several new skaters with League B who will not get to skate and haven\u2019t been privy to the history- but the board and the decision makers are still the same people, and their policies are still the same and still anti-volunteer. \n\nAITA for not volunteering AND for telling new referees why honestly?", "created_utc": 1702136709, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18eg912/aita_for_not_volunteering_for_a_specific_league/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I never knew.\n\nBut, definitely NTA.", "There is no interpersonal conflict here to judge. Who is actually calling you an asshole?\n\nReddit might not be well versed in derby culture, but i am. But from what I've seen to be an active member of a league, and tonrecievednthe benefits of membership you do need to pay the membership dues. It is expected leagues show some appreciation, and travel stipends are only somewhat common. And It's nice when leagues go above and beyond, but I don't think it should be expected. \n\nIf you volunteered for a food bank what would you be expecting to get from them in return?\n\nYou can volunteer for whoever you want, and if league b isn't working for you then don't volunteer there. Stick with A, it sounds like they treat their officials well.\nIt's weird that league b is actually reaching out to you to call you an asshole. People can be disappointed that they don't get to play, but to name a specific individual and insult them for it is uncalled for", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Wow. That\u2019s\u2026 \nDouble NTA.", "That is a spectacularly bad decision on their part. It's no surprise they can't keep volunteers. I've never heard of membership rights not equaling voting rights. Particularly because i think that might be illegal where I'm from? Not for profits can't have tiered membership, but you might be abke to get around it by not calling it membership.\n\nI also think I came off more harsh than I meant, I've just been an official, and a coach, and a board member. And ive found if you expect a lot as an official/Volunteer you'll just end up disappointed. I've mostly stopped officiating for my own league because it's not worth the hassle."]}
