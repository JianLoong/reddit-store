She denies any of my reasoning and goes on to say I can\u2019t read social cues and went so far as to call me autistic. Despite this, I simply said sorry if she found what I did rude but also said that her bringing it up is what ruined the night and not me.

Get and pay the bill when it's convenient, then sit and finish your drinks and conversation at a leisurely pace. Then when you're ready, you can simply get up and leave rather than trying to flag down your server and having to wait several minutes while they run your card and bring the bill back.", "Um very clearly NTA. Her comment about you being autistic is downright gross. How does your girlfriend feel?", "NTA  \nThat friend is an asshole. Your girlfriend should\u2019ve stood up for you. Reconsider that relationship.", "NTA. This sounds like standard practice to me. And that is reeeeally not cool to use \"autistic\" as a slur.", "NTA. Asking for the bill when you have a servers attention and you know you are finished is ok. But some places will expect you to leave when you\u2019ve paid to free up table for clearing and setting, so depending on the place they could\u2019ve felt rushed", "NTA This is a very common thing to do when everybody is finished. Sound like the best friend was looking for something to get in an argument about. \n\nShe is definitely the AH for saying that you have autism during the confrontation. If she believed that, it seems like she would be more understanding in the situation. \n\nDid your GF step in and stand up for you at all?", "NTA\n\nCalling someone autistic for requesting the tab to pay is beyond rude. Health issues are not too be used as insults.\n\nShe does not need to be invited for any other outings if she acts like that.\n\nI hope your girlfriend stood up for you.

I'm a slow wine drinker myself and often have a bit more to go after someone's asked for the bill.", "NTA, she wanted a reason to fight with you, ableism aside.", "Were you paying for the whole meal?

If a place is busy we will ask for bill once we know we aren\u2019t getting anything else. Nothing worse than waiting forever to get bill.", "Info: did you ask if anyone wanted to order anything else?", "NTA!  Friend is toxic.  If they thought this was an autistic response on your part, and used it to object to your behavior, as an insult!, they are wrong on so many levels that it's barely worth responding.  They sound like a huge asshole,  not worth your time.", "Essssh. NTA. \n\nThough maybe next time you can say \"shall I get the bill and we can pay while you finish your wine?\" It's probably what I would have done (though in the UK waiters can be very slow to come take payment after they've given you the bill. It might be different where you are). Even so, her reaction was very out of line. Especially the calling you autistic bit. Like if you were, would that be cause to shout at you?", "NTA she doesn't like you and is looking for something to complain about. No matter what you do, you will be wrong. Your gf could have said something and shut down her foolishness, but you can't reason with people like her.", "NTA That she decided it\u2019s rude doesn\u2019t make it rude.

Did she actually wanted to order more? You didn't looked on the clock every ten seconds, sighing and starting the \"oh my god i'm sooooo tired\"-routine\". \n\nI would talk with your gf if she really thought her behaviour was alright.

I don\u2019t see what you did as harmful if - as a group - you\u2019d already decided you wouldn\u2019t be ordering anything else.

I mean, it\u2019s usually good to just say to everyone \u201care we all ok if I get the bill?\u201d but what you did was neither offensive nor disruptive.

It's very common procedure to pay the bill when everyone is finished and knows they won't order anything else. Also using autism as an insult? God, this reminds me of 2016.

Will you be ordering dessert or shall I just bring the bill?\" If you say would like the bill and they are you're not done yet.
