I do it all the time when I want to find driving distances for myself.  \n\nHer reaction seems childish.  She disagreed with what you told her, so you showed her hard evidence.  She should have given you more respect since you lived there longer than her and were likely to already know better, and once you backed up your point,  she should have just conceded.", "NTA. As a texan, I sympathize. DFW area is the size of Connecticut.", "LOL NTA. What a whiney brat. She just felt dumb, but not your fault.", "NTA. As an Irish woman she\u2019s used to our longest drives being a few hours, but should know better than that in America.   She is being stupid, and over here we\u2019d say that lol, but you\u2019re best off just ignoring her for now. \nIt was a nice idea though.", "NTA \n\nObviously she didn't understand the American West.

She\u2019s projecting her insecurities onto you. I see no problem with visual aids to get your point across. Good thing you found out what she\u2019s like before you went on a road trip with her.

Showing on a map with driving distances is completely reasonable\u2014I mean, I use Google maps to figure out what length a trip would be and I live in the American west myself and have nearly my whole life.

People do not realize how big the state is. I live 2 hours from the Canadian border, around 3 hours from NYC and 6 hours from buffalo.

Also had someone insist they can drive from our hometown to central Florida in 7 1/2 hours. It takes 3 just to get to Jersey! Literally impossible based on mileage alone. It\u2019s well over 1000 miles. You can do it in about 22 if you\u2019re really pushing, but that\u2019s not a fun ride for anyone. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m rambling.
