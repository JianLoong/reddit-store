While I enjoyed the break from her\u2026 I didn\u2019t enjoy worrying about her safety. I\u2019m certain she will continue to believe I was just being paranoid", "With a peepee dance interlude representing the lack of potty breaks. Those who prefer more realism could just pee themselves.", "I see what you did there.", "I can count on my fingers how often I've driven, so I am absolutely terrible at guessing drive times.  I can tell you within ten minutes how long any trip on the NYC subway will take though.  Part of growing up in Brooklyn I guess.", "Well, that seems to be what OP did, and got called an asshole for doing so.", "Nailed it. American with quite a bit of miles logged in Europe, it's a completely different beast to drive there and I almost found religion driving in areas around the Bay of Naples in Vico Equense and Castellammare di Stabia. That said, when hanging out with some local friends there was always banter about each side not understanding driving logistics so we would absolutely breakout google maps and look. Kind of cool to do because we learned more about each other's respective countries/areas as well as ideas for trips.", "We just got back from England. Went to Seven Sisters Park from London. I\u2019ve never seen such narrow roads. The scenery was beautiful. On the trip back, we were on highways and made better time. But like in the states, the scenery wasn\u2019t as pretty.", "Many of my colleagues are in Europe. When I\u2019m at HQ in DK, I like to do a bit of sight seeing. It\u2019s common for me to ask my work friends \u201chey have you been to X?\u201d And they\u2019ll be all \u201coh, no. It\u2019s way too far away!\u201d And then I\u2019m all \u201cmap says 45 min?\u201d \u201cYeah, too far.\u201d\n\nLOL I used to commute longer than that one way every day for work.", "PNW here - I feel like \"long drives\" start at the 4 hour mark.", "That\u2019s a valuable skill! Do you know how many times I check the time in the subway?!", "When we visited my dad in Lufkin (just north of Houston) my husband couldn't understand why going to see the Alamo wasn't just a pleasant day trip. We live in West Virginia and while not a large state by any stretch, for us to drive from our little corner of heaven to the state capital would take 5+ hours.", "Perhaps it was a larger number, it\u2019s been 25 years. But the guy who checked in the car called everyone else over to share in his disbelief.", "45 min is nothing. Same, I live in New York and that\u2019s like a reasonable commute on the train. I wouldn\u2019t think much of 45 min to hour in the comfort of one\u2019s own car, esp if sight seeing was involved!", "I\u2019m laughing so hard I\u2019m crying! I bet southwest bees and northeast bees don\u2019t know the same moves.", "As a teen I kept time via music.  The countdown clocks make it a lot easier.\n\nOn average it's 2-3 minutes per station, then maybe a minute or so in them.  Rush hour completely flips the script, and you still have to account for tunnels and bridges.  My favorite stretch is the wetlands on the A line though... catch that at the right time of day and it's like riding through a world of magic.", "I had a colleague planning a trip to the US earlier this year. Asked if I might join for lunch. I had to show him that it was a 12 hour drive from my house to that particular office. LOL\n\nI mean, I don\u2019t think the OP was making fun at all. I think her neighbor is just like my colleagues. When I lived in Europe it was lovely to go country to country faster than I could get out of my own state.\n\nOP was definitely NTA.", "\\> I always thought it was the blow up man you see outside car dealerships move.\n\n\"Air dancer,\" at least when chosing the emoji.", "Don't forget the heels for percussive flamenco steps . . . .", "Are you really asking that question? OFCOURSE WE ADD COSTUMES!", "This is the most poetic comment I\u2019ve ever seen", "Will it be my first interpretive dance about routes? Yes! \n\nWill it be my last? With those heels, also yes!", "Oh goody, even better.", "I don't know how else to say it.  The sunlight hits the land just so and it all glows.  It's the best part of the entire system in my opinion.", "Are you familiar with the show masked singer? I propose we wear those but then with colourful laser lights shooting from our behinds on each wag. Like wag yellow wag blue wag pink! People will all be like: oh wooow! What colour is next?", "I can totally picture it"]}
