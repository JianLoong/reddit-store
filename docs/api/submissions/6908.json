Sometimes people aren't the right fit and that's ok. And family members when given a job that they aren't qualified for have tendencies to take advantage of the fact that their family and don't put in effort. When it comes down to it, the point of a business is to make profit. If your family was causing profit loss, I can see how you would have to let them go. \n\nWhat exactly would their job entail? Have you thought about putting them at the very bottom position? He said a job in the company, not at the highest level, but just a job. So what I'm thinking is, give them the crappiest job in the company and make them earn their way up. Have them prove themselves worthy of their promotions. If they're insulted that that is what the deal is then that's on them if they don't want to take your offer. \n\nIf you have already given them a chance within the company and let them go because they couldn't meet company expectations then you already upheld your dad's wishes by giving them the opportunity. \n\nI hope this helps at all. NTA in my opinion.", "NTA. Nepotism in most businesses is a guarantee that talent won't stay with you. If people know that getting a job isn't reliant on your ability but on who you're related to then the other employees will lose respect for you as a leader.", "NTA - If they want a job they either have to have the skills or at least be willing to learn them. There's no point of giving everyone Jobs when the company goes bankrupt", "NTA. You also need to try to keep that business running, & if they're not any good at the job, your business will suffer for it. You tried to do what your father wanted, & it didn't work out.", "NTA\n\nYou gave them a chance.  They weren't fit for the job.  If your decision is mentioned in conversation, you're free to explain why.\n\nWould your father rather the business stay afloat or them have positions in the company? Well, if the business tanks, so do their jobs.  I'm sure your father would have done the same.", "Nta. Your cousins aren't owed jobs. You hired them and they fafo'd", "NTA that is why work and private life should be kept separate. It's not like you didn't even give them a chance to show how they can contribute to your business. They are constantly complaining so let them find job elsewhere on their OWN and show their true capabilities.", "NTA. Your dad would have eventually fired them, too. You\u2019re carrying his legacy forward the right way and I know he\u2019d be proud.", "You gave them a chance. The lack of skills is one thing - skills can be taught, and we seriously need to stop rejecting inexperienced candidates and start teaching them stuff. However, they complain about the work and the pay\u2026 even though they aren\u2019t qualified to earn more to begin with? No. You\u2019re correct, it\u2019s not fair towards your other employees. You tried, it didn\u2019t work, their attitude was horrible. You did right by your dad, now do right by the company you\u2019re responsible for. NTA", "NTA.  You dont work, you dont eat.  You know their characters as workers.  They see you as a meal ticket and are determined to ride your coat tails to ensure their own security while adding nothing of value to the business.  By employing a deadbeat employee, word spreads and morale among other coworkers suffers.  These people are a cancer that spreads and need to be cut out.  What would it say about your own leadership and what kind of example would it set?  You did the right thing.  Your father had good intentions but I think would have soon realized that his nephews/nieces were just dead weight.  You did nothing wrong.  NTA", "NTA, would your father have tolerated their shenanigans?  Probably not.  They got treated like any other employee, actually probably better, and they blew it.  It\u2019s not fair to you, or your employees, to support dead weight.", "INFO: Do you plan to give the third cousin a chance with an entry level job? Like full NTA on this because they sound like AH's but just curious since the third cousin wasn't mentioned.", "I'm assuming these were young people since you used the phrase \"once they were old enough to work\" and I'm going to go with a gentle YTA here because young people, by and large, suck at their first jobs. For someone starting their first job, even if they don't realise it, it's about developing a work ethic, navigating conflicts like wanting time off but not being approved for leave, meeting workplace requirements, and all the \"unsaid\" stuff that happens in workplaces like doing that extra chore even though it's not on your job description, because it makes the next guys life easier, etc.\n\nI would imagine there would have been time and opportunity to engage with these cousins and help them grow professionally and learn how to fit into the business. Show them the ropes, so to speak.\n\nNow that said maybe there wasn't time or opportunity, maybe the margins were too thin to effectively have three cousins on a paid traineeship, basically contributing nothing while they learned how to be valued employees. I just like to default to a place of guidance and growth, rather than sink or swim.", "NTA... you gave them a chance even when it wasn't you who made the promise (or where you like yeah sure, I'll give you that promise?). And they just didn't fit the job. If you gave them jobs anyways, that would be Nepotism (it kind of already was for giving them the jobs in the first place, so a bit of YTA for that).", "I agree. It's important to note, however, that getting started in the business is always difficult because most tasks other than driving are considered sh\\*t jobs (I'm not sure if I should include this in the edit).", "This is the answer. NTA.", "Before getting sick, he was a successful businessman, but after getting sick, he wanted to make sure that everyone was taken care of even though it wasn't in the company's best interests. It's really hard work and we strive to be the best, but I pay fair wages (well above average for this line of work) and employees seem happy because many of them have been here since I was a child.", "It bothers me that I can't give my disabled cousin a job (third cousin). I really do love him, but right now I'm not able to give him a chance because I don't think it's safe to leave him unattended in the garage, and neither can my staff really help him.", "I provided them with a salaried trial period. It goes without saying that they had to begin with the low-paying jobs because it wouldn't be fair to my other employees to promote them right away. The majority of the time, menial tasks involve cleaning the garage and assisting drivers or mechanics with smaller tasks.", "It's in one of the top comments but i will add it in the edit!", "Hi, I understand what you're saying, but I don't entirely agree. It is their first \"real\" job. They used to work at a supermarket or deliver newspapers when they were younger, but they had the same problems. We don't really have any margin; first, finance wouldn't allow it, and now we're so busy that we can't really train or care for them. I understand that they suck; most of us did at first, including myself, but the issue is that they felt entitled and superior to other employees as well.", "There are family run businesses out there where the majority of their employees are family. There's no problem with hiring family. Nepotism becomes a problem when family members are receiving more pay than non family employees, get promotions over other staff who are better suited, or receive other benefits that non-family employees don't have.", "You should. I'm sure they expected to skip over the learning phaze (shit jobs) and get automatically placed in an earned position. You're very right, it wouldn't have been fair to the other employees. NTA Op.", "Sounds like you did give them a job but they were either unwilling or unable to do the job at the level necessary for them to keep it. A promise of a job is not a promise of permanent employment regardless of job performance. Employing overly entitled relatives is a great way to sink any business. NTA", "Then you do the shit jobs. My first year on my job was full of repetitive work that was not glamorous at all. Lots of preparing things for next step for someone more advanced to continue. I was being taught on the side, but without spending hours filing the edges off stuff I\u2019d never have learned how to and not to do things.\n\nIt\u2019s a job. You don\u2019t get to do the \u2018cool\u2019 stuff until you can prove you are responsible and willing to listen. Beginners who cop an attitude to \u2018grunt\u2019 work are usually not to be trusted with the skilled stuff because they won\u2019t listen and aren\u2019t safe.", "I understand. A friend of mine owns a cafe and the beginnings of it were not exciting, fun, or glamorous. It's doing really well now but it took years before he got to this point.", "Still Nta !!", "still NTA, everybody starts somewhere.", "If you run a business where you employ family who can't/won't do the work properly, your non-family employees who *are* doing the work and are keeping you in business will get fed up and quit to work elsewhere. Depending on how many of them do it at once, you will be somewhere on the scale of \"in difficulties\" to \"utterly screwed\". Obviously you don't want that to happen, so the cousins can't work there.", "Then I think you met your dad's wishes. Don't beat yourself up over this. I know it's hard for you because you had to make a business decision that has a lot of emotional ties to it. If your cousins had shown gratitude and effort, the story for you and their outcome would have been much different. \n\nAlso, I'm sorry you lost your father. I can't imagine the pain of losing him. Good on you for respecting your dad and trying to do right by him but also by the company. I think if he saw you taking care of the company the way you are, he would be so proud of you. I think you have honored your father by making sure the business he started thrives.", "What about can't be fired even when doing work that would get non-family members fired? Isn't that an unfair advantage?", "This!
