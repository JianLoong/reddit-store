We started talking about literature and books and stuff and I told him I preferred comics, and he asked what kind of comics. I was up front with the kind of comics I liked (Boy\u2019s Love, which is like a genre of comics/books that feature male on male romance and sex, more commonly called yaoi) and he was surprised and asked to see them. I took him to my bedroom where I kept my stuff and showed him.\n\nHe got really quiet when I started showing him the comics I read, and I asked him what was wrong. He said he thought that I was kind of weird for reading and liking these comics, and that it made him uncomfortable that I had a \u201cfixation\u201d on \u201ctoxic and weird gay porn.\u201d I was hurt that he was talking about my interests like this, so I told him I told him BL (Boy\u2019s love) was how I found out I was queer, but he was still uncomfortable, so I just brushed it off and we went back to talking about other things. \n\nHe\u2019s been kind of distant ever since then, and I\u2019m wondering if he\u2019s just being sensitive or I legitimately fucked up.

On the one hand, wanting to share the thing that helped you work out who you were and is something you're really interested in, on the other hand yaoi has a bad reputation, and to a certain extent for a good reason. Just as there's plenty of lesbian porn designed for straight men by straight men, there's plenty of yaoi designed by straight women for straight women, both of which can contain harmful stereotypes and fetishisation (obvs not all yaoi is porn but a lot of people think it is)\n\nIf you care about him as a friend, apologise for making him uncomfortable and think about separating out the stuff that's more hard core and putting it somewhere separate. I read romance and (used to) read erotica and the romance lives on the book shelf, while the erotica lives in its traditional home, under the bed\n\nPS: killing stalking 1000% needs to not be one you show other people, especially not on a first introduction and definitely not a work friend, if that's one of the ones he picked up, you definitely need to apologise, just from a quick google it deals with some really serious topics that can be extremely traumatising", "INFO: Was this comic porn and was the guy aware he was going to look at porn?", "NAH. His reaction though is understandable as he may have had to deal with gay fetishization before. He could need more reassurance before being ok with the idea that you enjoy BL. I hope you guys work things out!", "Info - do you have examples of them? I\u2019m curious if it was specific titles or genre in general.", "NAH.  He asked to see your collection.  You showed him.  He didn't like it.  He stated his feelings, you explained yours, and now he needs time to process.  That's it, that's all.  Your friendship may or may not move forward from here... but you didn't do anything wrong by showing him your comics as asked.\n\nHope everything works out, OP!  Good luck!", "YTA. It was awkward for him because you are fetishizing gay men. It would be similarly awkward to show a Black man your collection of BBC porn, or show a Japanese woman your collection of Japanese school-girl porn.", "NAW, because he did ask to see your collection. \n\nBut he also has the right to not hang around you if he's been made uncomfortable. \n\nI would generally advise against showing your buddies Porn or Fetishist stuff. It weirds normies out.", "YTA. There is absolutely a problem with the fetishizing of Asian queer men. For starters, it's called boys love. It's creepy. I'm a lesbian and I know the kind of culture surrounding yaoi.", "INFO I need more information before I can decide. What kind of yaoi is it? Is it just romantic stories? Is it hentai? If it was hentai did you warm him before hand? How twisted are the stories?", "NAH \n\nhe asked to see and you showed him, he didn't like it. Oh well", "i was going to say N/A/H but you ONLY read BL, and support people/a book series that relies on gay rape fetishing, which.. as a gay man, yeah you fucked up. big time. stop supporting fetishizing content. \n\nalso, if ALL YOU HAVE is BL, that is fetishizing gay men. YTA.", "YTA, he wanted to see your Superman and Batman comics and you showed him your porn.", "YTA. Those types of comics are written for and by people who fetishize gay men. They are not indicative of healthy male homosexual relationships and often glorify violence and age gap/pedophilic relationships.", "YTA it\u2019s weird when straight and even queer women have a fixation on BL and yaoi. Maybe if you liked queer fictional materials in general it would be fine. But having it all be BL comics? That\u2019s fetishization.", "NAH\n\nSo, heres the thing I feel like loads of people are overlooking here: there's nothing wrong with having a fetish. You're attracted to what you're attracted to, and you don't have to feel guilty about that. That includes gay rape porn--yes, truly. You can have a specific fetish and that doesn't mean you will automatically fetishize/dehumanize actual people. So much of sexual fetishizing is rooted in complicated and somewhat inscrutable intermingling of psychology and desire. You don't have to \"figure it out\" or \"get over it\"--you can be attracted to whatever you're attracted to. And again, that doesn't mean you want to be actively participate in what you fetishize. There are plenty of people into porn that depicts rape fantasy, incest, BDSM, etc. who have *zero interest* in actualizing those fantasies. \n\nAll that being said, it's also okay for your friend to feel uncomfortable. You can't control that, and you need to accept that that's how he feels.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe him an explanation or a justification for liking what you like. He asked to see it and you showed him, his reaction is not your problem.", "NTA. Yes, most of the time the relationships depicted in these comics are unrealistic and sometimes can easily be labeled as toxic, but then again so are great many hetero-romance novels, and people still love them. Your taste in literature is your taste in literature, he doesn't have to like the genre in order to not to be judgemental about it.", "YTA\n\nSeems like an excessively creepy thing to do to be honest.  Most folks do not like to be fetishized.", "Honestly, NAH but you really should've known better", "NTA - My parents neglected my orthodontist appointments for most of my childhood too because I was in a retainer and the braces between the ages of 9 and 18 but went years without having my braces adjusted as a child. It truly caused me so much anxiety because I didn\u2019t have the executive function or resources to schedule appointments and go to them as a kid. Because of the way they taught me to neglect that responsibility it\u2019s been really challenging to deal with as an adult. I definitely plan on asking them for help when I go back to the orthodontist soon", "YTA", "NTA.\n\nYaoi is enjoyed by a huge cross section of the world's population. I'm totally straight and read it, along with MM romance, straight romance, MFM, MMF and all kinds of other literature. Gay people read straight romance and erotica quite regularly. Your friend is narrow minded and clearly thinks you are fetichizing gay reading material, which is a weird take since you're queer. Most of the rest of world does not think that way. Brush it off and move on. Don't let one person's misguided opinions negatively impact your life.", "NTA.  You told them what they were.  He asked to see them.  He can not like them, that\u2019s fine, but that doesn\u2019t make you an AH.", "YTA. you showed your gay friend your gay porn collection. Don't be a weirdo", "NAH.  People of all orientations are going to have a different reaction to pornographic books, movies, etc.  Some people are all in, some people grossed out, some people morally object.  The cross-product of your attitude to it vs his may be a factor in how close of friends you are, or the more restrictive friend may come to \"compartmentalize\" his dislike of your hobby.  Just as well the issue came up early.", "NTA because a) it's fiction, you're allowed to read things that are \"problematic\" without it being a huge thing. It's why bodice rippers are such a big genre as well. B) he did in fact ask to see it after you said it was BL, so it's odd to me to have a turn around from \"oh cool! BL let me see!\" to \"uhm ew why are you reading all this??\" and c) imo people throw around fetishizing far too easily. Are you rude/invasive to living queer men? No? Then honestly you're fine, it matters more how you behave towards actual living and breathing humans. \n\nSide note I'm curious what some of the ones you have on your shelf are tbh! I saw you had Killing Stalking and I enjoy that one as well, psychological horror is absolutely fascinating. I also remember reading one called Loveless in my teen years which looking back was very oof probably shouldn't have \ud83d\ude05 but it also contributed to me realizing I'm queer so y'know!", "NTA. Don\u2019t yuck someone\u2019s yum. That\u2019s what I always say.", "NTA.  Specifically NTA because I think he *is* an asshole for his words making you feel bad for having private interests and kinks. His discomfort peeking into your private life is not your fault or responsibility.", "hi izzy", "I don't know this comic but...is it toxic? Like the relationship in it? It doesn't really sound like you've done anything wrong he just had a reaction to it. Did he read any of it or is he just basing his judgement of it off the covers? NTA", "NTA - he *asked* to see them even after you told him what they were. It's not like you wandered into work waving printed out stills of gay porn.", "NTA. You are allowed to enjoy this type of content.", "\nMaybe he underestimated the morals or content you tried to describe in the literature?? \n\nIts probably less about the gay aspect, but more about the things he sees as morally unsafe to sexualize or promote such as sexualizing murder, encouraging rape or other aspects that it sounds like the literature might elude to? \n\nI\u2019ve seen that a lot of these refer to more twisted or erotic topics; I could be wrong though or maybe that\u2019s not the type of content he saw? \n\nI don\u2019t think you are wrong for having interest in these things and I don\u2019t think you are the AH. Especially if you warned him first. \n\nBut I think that he is justified in feeling uncomfortable depending on what he saw.\nEven if it\u2019s fiction, the morals of the story or the interest can come off as real. \n\nI could watch a fiction show about riding dragons\u2026.it\u2019s fake; but would it make me want to ride a dragon if I got the chance in reality life??? Yeah I\u2019d probably be more inclined if the shoe made it sound appealing and epic sort of thing \n\nOverall your not the AH though", "I was gonna go for y. t a but decided on NAH. Honestly, it was in poor taste, especially if your collection has more taboo topics. As someone who also reads BL, it's my guilty pleasure for a reason and I definitely understand why someone would be uncomfortable so I would never admit to it in real life. But you are also queer, so I think that does matter. I think it would be different if you were straight. You might feel differently if your gay friend showed you his extensive yuri collection vs if it was a straight man.", "YTA. This is borderline sexual harassment. Maybe not even borderline. Yaoi is animated porn. You don\u2019t just flash porn at people.", "NTA, if he was in deep with with anime, manga, comics, or graphic novels, he would understand. If not, it's all weird. Anything can be fetishized. Honestly how I found this out was learning about the \"male gaze\" in comics. If it helped you figure you out, I'm sure it's helped others. As long as you don't hurt anyone, just be yourself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Let alone porn fetishizing that person's sexuality.\n\n Probably wouldn't even show somebody porn in the first place.\n\nThat just me I guess.\n\nOp mislead the guy. He thought she had comics that were gay romances. I mean they she phrased it initially? If I didn't know what BL was, I'd have thought it was a romance where both leads are men for once.\n\nInstead She showed him rape/torture kink porn featuring gay men, that was written by a woman for other women (bl is not written for gay/bi men. The target audience is actually women)\n\nBL is a genre that loves insanely toxic relationships.

I\u2019ve been buying physical copies ever since I\u2019ve gotten a steady job, so while my collection isn\u2019t like half a room huge I\u2019d say it\u2019s decent enough sized that it can occupy several drawers and have a dedicated section on my shelf", "I agree so much. Straight women fetishizing gay men isn\u2019t cute or funny, and it shouldn\u2019t be normalized. \n\nJust as heterosexual men are criticized for propagating lesbian pornography and causing that whole market to cater towards men, BoysLove literature should be subject to the exact same criticism. I am a gay man and I can\u2019t tell you how infuriating it is to realize that the gay erotic literature market is dominated by straight women who fundamentally DO NOT understand how male attraction works, **much** less how gay male sex and eroticism works. I enjoy written erotica as my primary form of pornography and it is very clear when the author is a woman because when it gets to the sexual foreplay and/or climax, their ignorance as to how a penis works is so confidently ignorant and blatant.\n\nWhat I am about to say is contentious, but as a gay man, homosexual written erotica has been **ruined by straight women**. They are now the dominant authors within that space and it really sucks.", "Just a heads up, I think you've commented on the wrong post", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "What?", "Well, lots of older yaoi comics do indeed depict quite toxic relationships, but people also like 50SoG and nobody makes a big deal about it.", "One of the comics was a really popular one that\u2019s kind of controversial (killing stalking) so I think he might have gotten upset seeing that?

It was just comics, and he was flipping through some of my comics on his own", "Are you serious? Because that should definitely be in the main post if so.\n\nBecause it adds a different layer of issues other than some \"boy love\" fans fetishizing gay men and making the gay men around them uncomfortable. \n\nBecause while that can be a big issue on it's own the toture/rape content would very understandable of freaked her friend out. That's not the kind of fetish you just spring on someone and not consider the reaction you'd get.", "I will say that fetishization, even when fictional, can be shitty to see. Because it may be interpreted like, \"I really want to fetishize gay people, but I know that I'll get dragged for fetishizing real people, so I'll do it with fiction instead to cover my ass.\" In short, fetishization in fiction could look like an excuse to act on problematic viewpoints that you have in real life. It's not always like that, and I can imagine your friend is struggling to determine how to tell if your interest in BL is an excuse to fetishize or a genuine interest in shared queerness.", "The characters are, but homosexuality isn't. a lot of people get really weirdly obsessed with gay people, and they're usually Yaoi readers.", "This may be the single stupidest thing I\u2019ve seen today (and I\u2019ve been scrolling Reddit for a couple of hours, so that is really saying something).", "Is it the porn in general he's creeped out by or the fact that you have a rape/torture manga?

BL is a medium of representing queerness yes but there's also a big part of the yaoi genre that's about using gay men to act out very specific situations e.g. rape so women can feel safe. it's an issue in gay representation--not a stigma against ppl who like reading it--also doesn't mean that \"everything yaoi\" is beneficial to gay men irl like your friend. you chose to show super explicit and violent titles (the first two are korean I'm korean and y'all the korean lezhin comments are ALL about getting off to the comic like porn but also female sexuality in korea is repressed but i digress). I don't blame your friend being uncomfortable and feeling like boundaries were crossed. there's a time and a place when things you appreciate privately can make someone feel objectified or uncomfortable. you seem to value this friendship so if you understand your fuck up then talk to him--he's not overly sensitive, *you* were insensitive.", "hey. uh. as a gay man, if any friend i knew told me they had a copy of killing stalking id also drop them", "Bruh you got out killing stalking AND painter of the night to display?

Which centers around a homosexual romantic relationship between a serial killer and someone who he has trapped in his home. There is rape, torture, murder, Stockholm syndrome, extreme emotional abuse and incest between mother and child.

I've read it and it is absolutely not played as erotic or otherwise positive. I think the story itself is a good psychological thriller, and the way some people have romanticised the story really takes away from the genuinely interesting character dynamics and explorations of obsessive love and stockholm syndrome.", "The equivalence of these texts is disingenuous. The primary purpose of the texts you are citing is *not* sexual, and the degradation of the women in those texts is *not* for a primarily sexual purpose.\n\nTo contrast, the literature OP is reading is *primarily sexual*, and the degradation or subjugation of the gay men is *foundational* to the *erotic nature* of the text.\n\nThe texts you cite, like Beauty and the Beast and Flowers in the Attic, are damn near the antithesis of erotica. They are *not* erotic . \n\nYour cited texts are not primarily erotic, and the subjugation of the characters in those texts is not erotic. OP\u2019s are. \n\nDo not be tempted to draw false equivalency within society on this topic. We are talking about the specific interaction OP had with their friend, and within this interaction OP was the AH. For her to show her friend these things was a degrading experience for him."]}
