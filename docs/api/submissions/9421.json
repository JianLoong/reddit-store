On the one hand, wanting to share the thing that helped you work out who you were and is something you're really interested in, on the other hand yaoi has a bad reputation, and to a certain extent for a good reason. Just as there's plenty of lesbian porn designed for straight men by straight men, there's plenty of yaoi designed by straight women for straight women, both of which can contain harmful stereotypes and fetishisation (obvs not all yaoi is porn but a lot of people think it is)\n\nIf you care about him as a friend, apologise for making him uncomfortable and think about separating out the stuff that's more hard core and putting it somewhere separate. I read romance and (used to) read erotica and the romance lives on the book shelf, while the erotica lives in its traditional home, under the bed\n\nPS: killing stalking 1000% needs to not be one you show other people, especially not on a first introduction and definitely not a work friend, if that's one of the ones he picked up, you definitely need to apologise, just from a quick google it deals with some really serious topics that can be extremely traumatising", "INFO: Was this comic porn and was the guy aware he was going to look at porn?", "NAH. His reaction though is understandable as he may have had to deal with gay fetishization before. He could need more reassurance before being ok with the idea that you enjoy BL. I hope you guys work things out!", "Info - do you have examples of them? I\u2019m curious if it was specific titles or genre in general.", "NAH.  He asked to see your collection.  You showed him.  He didn't like it.  He stated his feelings, you explained yours, and now he needs time to process.  That's it, that's all.  Your friendship may or may not move forward from here... but you didn't do anything wrong by showing him your comics as asked.\n\nHope everything works out, OP!  Good luck!", "YTA. It was awkward for him because you are fetishizing gay men. It would be similarly awkward to show a Black man your collection of BBC porn, or show a Japanese woman your collection of Japanese school-girl porn.", "NAW, because he did ask to see your collection. \n\nBut he also has the right to not hang around you if he's been made uncomfortable. \n\nI would generally advise against showing your buddies Porn or Fetishist stuff. It weirds normies out.", "YTA. There is absolutely a problem with the fetishizing of Asian queer men. For starters, it's called boys love. It's creepy. I'm a lesbian and I know the kind of culture surrounding yaoi.", "INFO I need more information before I can decide. What kind of yaoi is it? Is it just romantic stories? Is it hentai? If it was hentai did you warm him before hand? How twisted are the stories?", "NAH \n\nhe asked to see and you showed him, he didn't like it. Oh well", "i was going to say N/A/H but you ONLY read BL, and support people/a book series that relies on gay rape fetishing, which.. as a gay man, yeah you fucked up. big time. stop supporting fetishizing content. \n\nalso, if ALL YOU HAVE is BL, that is fetishizing gay men. YTA.", "YTA, he wanted to see your Superman and Batman comics and you showed him your porn.", "YTA. Those types of comics are written for and by people who fetishize gay men. They are not indicative of healthy male homosexual relationships and often glorify violence and age gap/pedophilic relationships.", "YTA it\u2019s weird when straight and even queer women have a fixation on BL and yaoi. Maybe if you liked queer fictional materials in general it would be fine. But having it all be BL comics? That\u2019s fetishization.", "NAH\n\nSo, heres the thing I feel like loads of people are overlooking here: there's nothing wrong with having a fetish. You're attracted to what you're attracted to, and you don't have to feel guilty about that. That includes gay rape porn--yes, truly. You can have a specific fetish and that doesn't mean you will automatically fetishize/dehumanize actual people. So much of sexual fetishizing is rooted in complicated and somewhat inscrutable intermingling of psychology and desire. You don't have to \"figure it out\" or \"get over it\"--you can be attracted to whatever you're attracted to. And again, that doesn't mean you want to be actively participate in what you fetishize. There are plenty of people into porn that depicts rape fantasy, incest, BDSM, etc. who have *zero interest* in actualizing those fantasies. \n\nAll that being said, it's also okay for your friend to feel uncomfortable. You can't control that, and you need to accept that that's how he feels.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe him an explanation or a justification for liking what you like. He asked to see it and you showed him, his reaction is not your problem.", "NTA. Yes, most of the time the relationships depicted in these comics are unrealistic and sometimes can easily be labeled as toxic, but then again so are great many hetero-romance novels, and people still love them. Your taste in literature is your taste in literature, he doesn't have to like the genre in order to not to be judgemental about it.", "YTA\n\nSeems like an excessively creepy thing to do to be honest.  Most folks do not like to be fetishized.", "Honestly, NAH but you really should've known better", "NTA - My parents neglected my orthodontist appointments for most of my childhood too because I was in a retainer and the braces between the ages of 9 and 18 but went years without having my braces adjusted as a child. It truly caused me so much anxiety because I didn\u2019t have the executive function or resources to schedule appointments and go to them as a kid. Because of the way they taught me to neglect that responsibility it\u2019s been really challenging to deal with as an adult. I definitely plan on asking them for help when I go back to the orthodontist soon", "YTA", "NTA.\n\nYaoi is enjoyed by a huge cross section of the world's population. I'm totally straight and read it, along with MM romance, straight romance, MFM, MMF and all kinds of other literature. Gay people read straight romance and erotica quite regularly. Your friend is narrow minded and clearly thinks you are fetichizing gay reading material, which is a weird take since you're queer. Most of the rest of world does not think that way. Brush it off and move on. Don't let one person's misguided opinions negatively impact your life.", "NTA.  You told them what they were.  He asked to see them.  He can not like them, that\u2019s fine, but that doesn\u2019t make you an AH.", "YTA. you showed your gay friend your gay porn collection. Don't be a weirdo", "NAH.  People of all orientations are going to have a different reaction to pornographic books, movies, etc.  Some people are all in, some people grossed out, some people morally object.  The cross-product of your attitude to it vs his may be a factor in how close of friends you are, or the more restrictive friend may come to \"compartmentalize\" his dislike of your hobby.  Just as well the issue came up early.", "NTA because a) it's fiction, you're allowed to read things that are \"problematic\" without it being a huge thing. It's why bodice rippers are such a big genre as well. B) he did in fact ask to see it after you said it was BL, so it's odd to me to have a turn around from \"oh cool! BL let me see!\" to \"uhm ew why are you reading all this??\" and c) imo people throw around fetishizing far too easily. Are you rude/invasive to living queer men? No? Then honestly you're fine, it matters more how you behave towards actual living and breathing humans. \n\nSide note I'm curious what some of the ones you have on your shelf are tbh! I saw you had Killing Stalking and I enjoy that one as well, psychological horror is absolutely fascinating. I also remember reading one called Loveless in my teen years which looking back was very oof probably shouldn't have \ud83d\ude05 but it also contributed to me realizing I'm queer so y'know!", "NTA. Don\u2019t yuck someone\u2019s yum. That\u2019s what I always say.", "NTA.  Specifically NTA because I think he *is* an asshole for his words making you feel bad for having private interests and kinks. His discomfort peeking into your private life is not your fault or responsibility.", "hi izzy", "I don't know this comic but...is it toxic? Like the relationship in it? It doesn't really sound like you've done anything wrong he just had a reaction to it. Did he read any of it or is he just basing his judgement of it off the covers? NTA", "NTA - he *asked* to see them even after you told him what they were. It's not like you wandered into work waving printed out stills of gay porn.", "NTA. You are allowed to enjoy this type of content.", "\nMaybe he underestimated the morals or content you tried to describe in the literature?? \n\nIts probably less about the gay aspect, but more about the things he sees as morally unsafe to sexualize or promote such as sexualizing murder, encouraging rape or other aspects that it sounds like the literature might elude to? \n\nI\u2019ve seen that a lot of these refer to more twisted or erotic topics; I could be wrong though or maybe that\u2019s not the type of content he saw? \n\nI don\u2019t think you are wrong for having interest in these things and I don\u2019t think you are the AH. Especially if you warned him first. \n\nBut I think that he is justified in feeling uncomfortable depending on what he saw.\nEven if it\u2019s fiction, the morals of the story or the interest can come off as real. \n\nI could watch a fiction show about riding dragons\u2026.it\u2019s fake; but would it make me want to ride a dragon if I got the chance in reality life??? Yeah I\u2019d probably be more inclined if the shoe made it sound appealing and epic sort of thing \n\nOverall your not the AH though", "I was gonna go for y. t a but decided on NAH. Honestly, it was in poor taste, especially if your collection has more taboo topics. As someone who also reads BL, it's my guilty pleasure for a reason and I definitely understand why someone would be uncomfortable so I would never admit to it in real life. But you are also queer, so I think that does matter. I think it would be different if you were straight. You might feel differently if your gay friend showed you his extensive yuri collection vs if it was a straight man.", "YTA. This is borderline sexual harassment. Maybe not even borderline. Yaoi is animated porn. You don\u2019t just flash porn at people.", "NTA, if he was in deep with with anime, manga, comics, or graphic novels, he would understand. If not, it's all weird. Anything can be fetishized. Honestly how I found this out was learning about the \"male gaze\" in comics. If it helped you figure you out, I'm sure it's helped others.

Straight women fetishizing gay men isn\u2019t cute or funny, and it shouldn\u2019t be normalized. \n\nJust as heterosexual men are criticized for propagating lesbian pornography and causing that whole market to cater towards men, BoysLove literature should be subject to the exact same criticism. I am a gay man and I can\u2019t tell you how infuriating it is to realize that the gay erotic literature market is dominated by straight women who fundamentally DO NOT understand how male attraction works, **much** less how gay male sex and eroticism works. I enjoy written erotica as my primary form of pornography and it is very clear when the author is a woman because when it gets to the sexual foreplay and/or climax, their ignorance as to how a penis works is so confidently ignorant and blatant.\n\nWhat I am about to say is contentious, but as a gay man, homosexual written erotica has been **ruined by straight women**.

That's not the kind of fetish you just spring on someone and not consider the reaction you'd get.", "I will say that fetishization, even when fictional, can be shitty to see. Because it may be interpreted like, \"I really want to fetishize gay people, but I know that I'll get dragged for fetishizing real people, so I'll do it with fiction instead to cover my ass.\" In short, fetishization in fiction could look like an excuse to act on problematic viewpoints that you have in real life. It's not always like that, and I can imagine your friend is struggling to determine how to tell if your interest in BL is an excuse to fetishize or a genuine interest in shared queerness.", "The characters are, but homosexuality isn't. a lot of people get really weirdly obsessed with gay people, and they're usually Yaoi readers.", "This may be the single stupidest thing I\u2019ve seen today (and I\u2019ve been scrolling Reddit for a couple of hours, so that is really saying something).", "Is it the porn in general he's creeped out by or the fact that you have a rape/torture manga?

BL is a medium of representing queerness yes but there's also a big part of the yaoi genre that's about using gay men to act out very specific situations e.g. rape so women can feel safe. it's an issue in gay representation--not a stigma against ppl who like reading it--also doesn't mean that \"everything yaoi\" is beneficial to gay men irl like your friend. you chose to show super explicit and violent titles (the first two are korean I'm korean and y'all the korean lezhin comments are ALL about getting off to the comic like porn but also female sexuality in korea is repressed but i digress). I don't blame your friend being uncomfortable and feeling like boundaries were crossed. there's a time and a place when things you appreciate privately can make someone feel objectified or uncomfortable. you seem to value this friendship so if you understand your fuck up then talk to him--he's not overly sensitive, *you* were insensitive.", "hey. uh. as a gay man, if any friend i knew told me they had a copy of killing stalking id also drop them", "Bruh you got out killing stalking AND painter of the night to display?

Killing stalking is a psychological horror with Stockholm syndrome, etc. It is not romance. I hate that people romantasize it and make it seem like it's love when it most certainly isn't.  The author herself even said it isn't romance. If OP is reading KS as if it's love then she is very very weird but if she is reading it with the knowledge that it isn't love then that's fine.\n\nEdit: killing stalking is not for the faint of heart and I do not condone showing it to someone who doesn't know what it is.

I'm queer myself and I've encountered a number of bisexual women who do fetishize men who love men and the relationships between them.\n\nI don't think there's necessarily anything wrong with enjoying portrayals of relationships/sexual encounters which doesn't correlate with an individual's gender/orientation, but the problem comes with consuming (and creating) fetishistic material. The difference between the two is that unlike the former, the latter is usually an objectifying depiction that not only does not reflect reality, but can perpetuate harmful stereotypes or behaviors. One example is how some men watch \"lesbian\" porn which a) is usually highly unrealistic and almost never actually designed for lesbians and bi women (hence why I put lesbian in quotation marks, especially considering that the actresses often aren't even lesbians or even attracted to women), and b) gets some men to stop seeing lesbians as actual people and instead as sexual objects to get off to, which can lead to actual harm to lesbians.\n\nI've seen women who fetishize gay men do stuff like ask them to their face if they're a top or bottom (roles in gay sex involving who penetrates and who is penetrated), \"fangirling\" over their relationships, trying to push gay men they know to be with men they think would look hot with them, etc. This is another example of how people who fetishize these relationships stop perceiving them as normal and instead as something that exists for fantasy.", "This ^.

The fact the he is gay only makes it worse in this scenario.\n\nI hope you can make it clear to him that these don't reflect your actual personal beliefs/views and are in fact just fictional erotica. This might be hard to understand for...idk...normies? What's a nicer word for that?", "NAH, from your post I think he expected Romance and softcore stuff and found hardcore stuff instead. You're not TA showing him your collection but surely you understand that reading killing stalking as someone who hasn't been exposed to it will be shocking. Just apologize for shocking him and react accordingly based on his action.", "NAH he\u2019s understandably uncomfortable, IMO i don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird or uncomfortable when queer women like yaoi. my close lesbian friend loves yuri & yaoi and they chat with my bf who is also into both. \n\nyes im also gay. that being said i do think u have bad taste in manga lol", "NTA\n\nHe asked, you showed. It's rude considering he knew you had comics and what they were about. Not specifically those but BL comics also did help with my awakening when I was younger.", "NAH, i mean it's okay to like yaois and all, but his r\u00e9action is understandable, also, it is more logic of being weirded out if you show him hardcores ones (like Yabichi) but cutr boys love stories is still cool and all", "NTA. Reading through some of the comments I get the gist of what those comics are and they seem pretty equivalent to bodice ripper romance novels. I'm guessing the reason people are ok with novels versus comics is the lack of pictures. Whatever floats your boat. He doesn't like it and that's ok. You don't bring it up again and move on", "Is it somehow different from showing, for example, a white girl your collection of white straight porn? I kindly ask for explanation for i'm not sure i can understand it.", "It's worth to consider that OPs friend asked to see the comics after being told what they are tho. At least that's how I understand the post. OP didn't force him to look at them.", "It\u2019s amazing to me that so many people in this thread know what this is. I have never heard of it before. I\u2019m not heavy into BL so maybe that\u2019s it but this an infamous series or something?", "It was, as well as so much more", "It\u2019s shocking to me that OP is missing this", "Could you give a bit more insight into the topic? I'm don't anything about this.\n\n\n>For starters, it's called boys love.\n\nThis doesn't seem inherently creepy to me, that's why I'm asking.", "Counterpoint: They are fetishizing something that deeply affects their FRIEND and then SHOWING that to them after making it sound like it was media for queer people, not for violent fetishists (and I use the word violent because the content IS violent, not saying all fetishists are violent). That\u2019s disturbing and misleading.", ">B) he did in fact ask to see it after you said it was BL, so it's odd to me to have a turn around from \"oh cool! BL let me see!\" to \"uhm ew why are you reading all this??\"\n\nI fully agree with you, except for this part. It's quite obvious that he didn't know at all what BL is and probably just expected some lighthearted romance stories from the description he was given.", "Yaoi in itself is quite a wide genre and has both disgusting and just sweet love stories", "In that case OP is the asshole for showing potentially triggering content without proper warning. Asking to see a \"boys love\" collection is not equivalent to asking to be shown explicit, traumatising sex scenes. Thats like saying you read straight romance novels and then shoving fifty shades of grey under other peoples noses.", "No, he asked to see \"boys love\", not explicit sex and rape. Thats like asking for recommendations for straight romance books and getting fifty shades of grey shoved under your nose.", "OP is very clearly being *extremely careful* in his description of events.\n\nHe knows that most people won't have any idea what these comics are about. I imagined they would just be Japanese comics about gay dudes. It never occurred to me they would essentially be some form of fetish porn. \n\nI guess OP already knew if his title was **I showed my gay friend my collection of violent gay fetish porn, AITA** the answer would be pretty obvious.", "i dont read BL but i am active on tumblr. killing stalking was very popular a few years ago", "Insulting insinuation but ok", "yaoi is made for (mostly straight) women as a method of fetishizing gay/queer asian men. it's like men watching lesbian porn and fetishizing lesbians\n\nit's made specifically to sexualize gay male relationships without supporting equality or anything, leaning into a lot of stereotypes. and also, a lot of the authors of yaoi/yuri (female equivalent) are straight", "Also a lesbian, and gay women are frequently fetishized by men. It\u2019s gross and uncomfortable and can sometimes be dangerous.\n\nBoys love as a genre is problematic because it inherently focuses on the fact that the couple are male and their specific relationship which is usually deeply sexualized. It\u2019s not labeled as LGBTQ, which usually has to do with queer culture and issues specific to LGBTQ people. Boys love/girls love is a way for consumers to only focus on the gender and sexuality of the characters while ignoring the rest of queer culture, topics, and values. Fetishization and sexualization are never okay but especially toward members of marginalized communities.", "I complain a lot about how it's so difficult to find sapphic written erotica (or fiction in general), but on the other hand I'm very aware that at least the sapphic written market is primarily by sapphics for sapphics. I don't ever see fans of MLM fiction who are straight women actually support MLM fiction written by gay and bi men. I even saw a gay author on social media get attacked by them for expressing the same kind of frustration you have with this situation.", "Just looked it up\u2014super popular back in Korea, huh. Not my thing but to each their own. Sure as hell wouldn\u2019t let someone from work pick it up, that looks like it gets into snuff porn territory.", "Thank you for the insight!", "Im not a big fan of BL manga unless it\u2019s slice of life manga but for me killing stalking to me is more on thriller genre with BL rship. \n\nWont consider it as typical fetish BL manga.", "No no no no no! Collecting this material is supporting it.  I would never go to the home of someone who fetishized this type of material.  It's not ok.", "When your kink is rape or physically assaulting women, yes we need to kink-shame. Feel free to research just how bad porn is for the women involved and how it affects male brains and sexuality. \n\nRape porn. Smh", "That is quite the drastic positioning. Many non con fanfiction/internet authors write as a therapy method for their own rape/non con experience (as a victim). For them its a safe way to explore feelings regarding fears, kinks and sexuality in general and does not mean authors or readers condemn any of what they read/write. But I guess if you feel that way the friendship would be doomed anyway.\n\nThat being said showing your porn to your friends unsolicited should be a big no no in general. Especially if potentially triggering content is included.", "Why are you talking about women? Killing Stalking's sex scenes are between two men.", "Some women enjoy that kink to tho. As long as everyone participating is a consenting adult is it really shame worthy? It's just another kink under the BDSM umbrella. \n\nPorn is bad for the brain tho, I agree with that.", "Just to want to make sure that I\u2019m clear. It\u2019s okay to abuse women, just as long as you are not sexually abusing them. Okay got it!"]}
