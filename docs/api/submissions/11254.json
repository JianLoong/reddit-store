My own mother asked me if she could be in my delivery room and I said No. Just No. Sure, she can hold my baby after but nobody except my husband and the delivery team is allowed inside the delivery room.

Before you mom starts trying to be a third parent and push your wife out. \n\nHow will youn handle her not getting vaccines? Kissing the baby? Wanting to babysit? Or feed the baby? Complaining that your wife is/is not breastfeeding. Buying clothes, wanting to change/bathe baby? And so much more. \n\nTalk to your wife and figure these things out now. Write them down so you can send a rule list to your mother in writting. So she can't claim she didn't know about the rules later.", "NTA!! NTA!! Hooray for you for standing up for your wife and protecting her, and not knuckling under to your mother. THIS is what you're supposed to do: take care of your wife, and your child before the interests of your mother. Finally! A husband on here who is not a total wuss when it comes to his mother! I hope you will always be this way with your wife and children! NTA!!", "NTA this is so refreshing. You did exactly the right thing, unprompted. Boundaries feel like threats to people who benefit from you having none. You view your wife as a human, your mom seems to view her as a birthing vessel. Also, tip off your nursing team and they\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t get unwanted surprise visitors! They don\u2019t mind being the bad guy. I\u2019ve had them make up lies to cover for me before lol", "NTA\n\nVery obviously.  You\u2019re doing the right thing.\n\nNot just about the birth itself.  As everyone else is saying, that\u2019s a medical event for your wife, so her needs are what is important.  It sounds like keeping your mother from taking things over after birth is going to be a problem as well, and you\u2019ll be NTA for making sure your wife, your baby, and you are comfortable there too.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nETA: A piece of advice from a married lady with a wonderful but\u2026 er, well let\u2019s just say Stereotypical Southern Mama-in-law, when my husband delivers news that might not be well-received, he makes it a point to always use \u201cwe\u201d and never \u201cshe\u201d. It makes a world of difference.", "NTA - Your wife is the one giving birth, she gets to call the shots. You are doing the right thing but honoring her wishes. Everyone else can hang out in the waiting room or at home.", "NTA but start using the phrase \"WE decided\", \"WE think it would be best\" not \"my wife thinks, my wife decided\".  You are a TEAM, make decisions together and stick to then together.  You are inadvertently throwing your wife under the bus and your mother will grasp at any straws to blame her.", "NTA, your mom is off her damn rocker if she thought she was automatically invited into the birthing room to watch her daughter in law give birth.\n\nI didn't even have my mom in the room. It was just me, my husband and the medical team.\n\nGiving birth ain't a spectator sport.\n\nKeep those boundaries and keep supporting your wife, good job.", "NTA. OP, you need to make your mother understand that you are your own person and your relationship with your wife is not something that she can just barge in and control. If you don't set this boundary, things will get much worse when your baby is actually born.", "Why would a woman want her MIL in the delivery room ever? Her own mother I can understand but MIL is so not typically there", "NTA stand by your wife. Once you married her you committed to sharing your life with her and making a family with her. Your mother is being absolutely ridiculous. If I was your wife I wouldn\u2019t want someone who is bad mouthing me to be around me or my child. You are not required to keep anyone in your life that is toxic and disrespects your wife and family. Her being your mother and behaving like and immature child is worse. Set boundaries now or she\u2019ll be disrespecting your wife and interfering with your parenting until you put her in check.", "NTA- you my friend have what is called a \"shiny spine\" and its a massively good thing. THANK YOU for standing up for your wife and her bodily autonomy. You and your wife will be teaching your child what they deserve in life and would you ever want them to let someone get away with treating them that way and not say anything? Even if it was you messing up?  I think not. \n\nYour wife's body, your wife's choice, period. And if i was you i'd put her on timeout. If she continues to act this way it would be \"if you dont stop right now not only will you not see baby when everyone else gets to, youll be waiting a week longer, and everytime i hear about it i'll be adding another week\".\n\nCheck out r/justnoMIL for a glimpse at your future if you dont stand your ground and shut this shit down now. This stuff ends marriages if not dealt with quickly (seems to me youve started on the right foot, now keep going). If you dont draw a line now and she doesnt respect your right to make parenting decisions about your child together then youre setting yourself up for disaster.", "NTA. Why the fuck would she ever think she was entitled to be there. \u201cHere if you need me\u201d is how it should be phrased, not \u201cwhat time should I be there\u201d. WAIT TO BE ASKED. The entitlement, Jesus fucking Christ.", "NTA. Your wife is a shellfish? lol.  Your mother is out of line and will continue to overstep with your child if you dont eatablish boundaries now. Choose your wife, every time.", "Childbirth is not a spectator sport.\n\nTNA", "NTA and so very love the \"shellfish\" \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "NTA.  Only me and my husband when our child was born.  It isn\u2019t a spectator sport!  Your wife should only have the people there that bring her comfort.  My own mother wasn\u2019t there until a week later.  Your mother has no rights here, she\u2019s being selfish and entitled.  Bravo, Sir, for supporting your wife and standing up to your mother.  You\u2019re a wonderful husband!", "It\u2019s better to keep very young babies away from people for a while after birth. Some folks wait up to  three months, and some wait even longer - babies don\u2019t really have a functioning immune system when they\u2019re super-fresh. \n\nAs much as the new parents might love them and want them to meet the baby, visiting family members carry germs, and newborns are fragile. So for the baby\u2019s safety, a lot of people choose to wait for a while before letting others meet them.", "Newborns are extremely susceptible to pertussis (whooping cough)  unless the family around them has had their DTP booster and RSV is extremely prevalent right now, the parents are being cautious and good parents .", "Also not only just baby having a weak immune system. Sometimes new parents want that alone time to bond with baby. It is a big adjustment for them as well and they want a month or so to adjust with out people being around of giving them input. It\u2019s also very stressful after birth to recover and if she has postpartum it can take a while for her to adjust as well", "I told my husband that I had no interest in having my MIL in the room and if she ended up there I took no responsibility for what might fly out of my mouth when I was in pain.  Since my husband has heard the things that come out of my mouth when I am mildly annoyed, he took that warning to heart.", "\ud83e\udd9e", "Idk it seems a little fishy.", "My husband and I waited a month. We didn't live near family, so they couldn't just drop by, and I wasn't wanting to be anyone's hostess. I also wanted us to be comfortable with our son.", "I decided very last minute like days before that I actually did want my mom and with all the complications I had and the baby had I was very lucky my mom agreed and my husband was ok with my choice, he wanted me to be comfortable. Otherwise my mom wouldn\u2019t haven\u2019t cared if I said no like I did in the beginning.", "\u201cWe\u201d implies that he\u2019s part of the decision though. He has no place in making that decision.", "I second that!", "THIS!! That last paragraph!", "Even if the mom has to wait a whole month before meeting baby, she still has no room for complaints. It's not her baby.", "My wife wants the bonding and heal up before baby meeting everyone.", "This. Inform hospital staff and anyone who does not have the patient's explicit permission to be there will be kept out.", "Depending on the mother, it's normal. Some new moms bring their mom or family for emotional support.", "Until I started reading this sub I had no idea people even had their parents there! Maybe it's a cultural thing but I don't know a single person who has had anyone but their partner/husband.", "The hospital won't let people on the floor unless they are delivering a baby or have the special password from the mother. So we're safe from unwanted visitors.", "One more time for the people in the back? BIRTH IS NOT A SPECTATOR SPORT. \n\nYour wife has sole control over who she wants in the room and she should! This is absurd. NTA. I\u2019m glad you have her back.", "I don\u2019t often see this mentioned but truly, how are there so many people sharing arguments with extended family? And then those family members are getting involved? It\u2019s wild to me. If I called an aunt or cousin about an argument of this nature they\u2019d say I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re upset and move on.", "Honestly I only started looking in the comments because I wanted to see some shellfish related jokes like \u201cyou better flex your mussels and tell your mom she conch act like that around your wife\u201d", "Was looking for this comment!", "I love the spectator sport comment. So true!", "Came to say this. They should be more than happy to keep uninvited people out. NTA and good for you for supporting your wife!", "That\u2019s great advice I will one day impart to my daughter in case she ever needs it!", "THIS. This right here. Do not give her an iota of ammo to vilify your wife for only wanting you with her. And I'd be very clear her with about boundaries-both of you get to decide when she gets to see the baby so she needs to clean up her act sharpish.", "\ud83c\udf64\ud83d\udc76\ud83c\udffb", "\u201cWe\u201d also implies a united front against monster in law.\nShe can\u2019t make the wife the \u201cbad guy\u201d if it\u2019s united", "He agrees, though. Don\u2019t throw her to the wolves.", "And further it\u2019s disgusting she yelled at OP\u2019s wife. Disgraceful", "Right? Why would anyone think she has any ground to stand on? I totally understand wanting to see her grand baby, but\u2026 it\u2019s not her baby.", "As she should. Plus covid is still a thing.", "We waited 6 weeks after the baby was born for anyone to meet the baby in person. It was great! You can send pictures/videos and video chat until then. Great job for sticking up for your wife and her needs and wants!", "Which is totally valid. I would only suggest letting loved ones know that you \u201cwill let them know when you are ready for guests\u201d rather that setting a definite timeline.\n\nThe only thing predictable about a new baby is that it will be different than your expectations. You may want more or you may want less time.", "Make sure you info hospital staff of who is and isn\u2019t allowed in.", "Yes THEIR MOM not their MIL. Big huge difference. No way in hell do you want your MIL in there during that time.", "You don\u2019t hear mother in law going in too often", "And when it\u2019s time for you to give birth your mom is welcome to watch.", "Is this a cultural thing?", "That's great security! Our hospitals are a little more open so it's not as easy for the nurses to play guards. I still wouldn't tell. My dad thought he heard a baby cry and burst into the room mid push while I was facing the doorway. I couldn't imagine being your wife and her mother-in-law bursting in to see her in that vulnerable position.", "The mom does seem a bit crabby about the whole situation and just fishing for sympathy."]}
