I think this would have worked better. \n\nWhy were those people invited over?", "NTA.  It\u2019s normal to want your home to reflect you are your husbands life together and tastes.  It\u2019s your home.  On the flip side it\u2019s also normal for someone to be upset when something their daughter was a part of is now gone.  She went to far blaming you but it\u2019s understandable she would be upset.  It\u2019s not your fault though.  It\u2019s something she just needs to work through.  It\u2019s not fair for her to take it out on you though as if you did something wrong.", "NTA. It's understandable that she'd be upset, but that's not on you. It was appropriate for you and your husband to redecorate.\n\nGive her some time. Hopefully she'll come to understand that the redecorating is no reflection on her daughter or the life she shared with your husband.\n\nIt's possible she won't get over it, and they'll drift away from your husband, and that's ok, too.\n\nNone of that is a reflection on you or your husband in any way.", "NTA. It's your home now, with your new husband. You were harassed and yelled at, so it's perfectly understandable that you lost your patience, anyone would after some time.\n\nI do understand their pain and even what made their react how they did as they saw the house as a \"Sanctuary\" of their daughter, and seeing it changed was a painful reminder of it.  \nMy suggestion is, when everyone calm down, and if your husband is ok with it, to give them some of her belongings, like wedding photos (or make copies of it for them).", "NTA. \n\nthey are grieving but you are right. their daughter unfortunately no longer with them. and its wrong for them to be expecting the husband to be holding onto that memory when he is starting a new life with you. your husband could have given the former FIL a heads-up just in case to avoid this situation. but you are absolutely in right here.", "NTA. I really don\u2019t know what they were expecting. Your house isn\u2019t a museum for their daughter & it\u2019s almost been a decade since she died. Your husband is allowed to move on.", "NTA. They obviously expected your husband not to move on with his life which is unfair and wrong. At best, he could have given them a polite \"heads up\" letting them know you've made changes. I can imagine it was a shock for them to be where they were previously surrounded by memories of her and they will always grieve the loss, but that doesn't justify her reaction.", "NTA \nYou have every right to decorate as y'all want. You did nothing wrong, she's just sad and grieving still.", "NTA. It\u2019s unreasonable for his former MIL to expect the house to remain unchanged forever.", "NTA why would YOUR husband have pics of him & his widow still hanging up in the house when he is now married to YOU?", "NAH.  \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong.  Your husband has a right to remarry and move on.  Sounds like there are no kids involved so it is normal for him to want to remodel his home with his new wife (you) and have a fresh start.  It is totally fine that he didn't want to keep up any photos of his first wife. \n\nIt is also normal that he has a relationship with the parents of his first wife.  They were his family and he was in love with their child and his shared grief will bond him to that family, possibly forever.  However, it is up to him to set healthy boundaries as they will not be able to do so. When parents lose a child it is the most difficult loss, even when that child is an adult.  For the parents, your husband and the home he shared with their daughter are a reminder of her.  His (your) house may have felt like a monument to them so seeing it remodeled is like seeing their daughters gravestone smashed to pieces.  Her reaction was coming from the grief that she holds every day, it wasn't rational and I am sure she could not really control it. You can't reason with pure emotion, and when it comes to a dead child, everything is pure emotion.  We can't fault them.  Life is just too painful sometimes.  Your husband is the only man their daughter ever loved:  so even if they (logically) are happy for him that he has found love again they will still find it painful to see ways where his life moves away from what it was with their daughter.  The house she lived in changing was like another piece of her disappearing from the world. It hurts. But if you don't know anyone personally who has been through the loss of a child then you wouldn't really know to expect a big reaction and warn them ahead of time.", "NTA.    They lost their daughter,  beyond sad.   However, Its now your house. Not hers. Not her daughters. Your life is not a novel where the dead person's things were not touched for ever and made a shrine", "NTA \u2026. not to be mean but she\u2019s isn\u2019t here anymore so they need to move on", "NTA We have to live for the living, not live in the shadow of the dead.", "NTA and seriously you handled it way better then I think I would have.", "NTA. It\u2019s not her daughter\u2019s house. She had no right to make those comments. She\u2019s misplacing her grief and it\u2019s not appropriate.", "NTA\n\n Ffs, did she expected you to live in a memorial house for her daughter?? Her daughter's dead, you didn't even knew her and that's your house. Honestly, why is this woman even involved in your life? I would understand if they had kids, but since they don't, why do you have to put up with her?? \n\n Consider this a blessing in disguise. Maybe she'll stop coming to your house and you'll get rid of her.", "NTA", "I think you are being kind. Of course you can't live in a shrine to her. Her mother cross a line by verbally attacking you.\n\nYou need boundaries. No more coming to the house. Stay more distant. Your husband needs to be clear that if they can't respect you and your lives moving in without their daughter then they need to stay quiet about it and not dump it in you and not dump it on him either.", "NTA. It is your home and you can decorate all you want. I\u2019m sure your husband was happy to give it a fresh start too. It\u2019s your moments and memories that are going to fill it. A house is meant to be lived in, and you can\u2019t do that if it\u2019s treated as a mausoleum.", "NTA. It sounds like the two of you enjoyed the renovations and it was a good idea.\n\nThe loss of his first wife is tragic. But if her parents want a shrine it should not be in your house let alone the entire house.\n\nMy husband passed away 7 years ago. My son and I after about 6 months went through his things in the house, boxed up and saved what he wanted. I saved what I wanted. The rest was trashed, donated or given to his family.\n\nFor her parents to expect no changes after your husband moved on and got married is unrealistic. Husband needs to explain this to them.\n\nI would suggest they aren't allowed in your home going forward. And maybe getting some distance would be good.", "NTA, but your husband sound have addressed his former MIL. She\u2019s obviously very much still grieving, but it\u2019s unreasonable to expect you to maintain her daughter\u2019s former home as some kind of shrine to her.", "NTA but this is 100% on your husband to address.  There\u2019s no reason for someone who treats you like a villain to be in your home.", "> It doesn't look like she even lives here\n\nShe doesn't.\n\nGod knows they're in an awful position but their assistant expectation that he'd live his life from **25** onwards as a living shrine to her was not just unrealistic but cruel.", "NAH. \n\nIt\u2019s you and your husbands home. However given this was the first time they visited and the house was completely different then when her daughter lived there; I understand how emotional she would have been due to her grief.", ">He doesn\u2019t visit her grave, or celebrate her birthdays or any day really. It\u2019s just any other normal day for us.\n\nAfter reading this just give his late wife's belongings to her parents, who cherish her, and move on. Staying away from them would be doing them a favor because he is acting like he never loved her and I think that photo thing was the last straw for his former MIL. She wanted to see that he was appreciating his late wife and he didn't. He doesn't seem like he really cares about her so why not just cut contact and stop torturing them?\n\nESH", "I think thats a good idea! If they want to see yall again, meet up somewhere else.", "ESH.  They see you as replacing her daughter and erasing her memory.  \n\nIt doesn't matter if you are intentionally doing it or not; they are having a hard time grieving and could use time with a therapist to talk about it.  \n\nP.S.

There is absolutely no reason you can't put away wedding photos.  No one wants to be reminded of their husband being married to someone else.

Life is about moving forward constructively. Your goal was not to eliminate her, but to fully establish you, as it should be.\n\n>His late wife\u2019s parents were visiting town to see some of their grand kids from his late wife\u2019s brother who lives in the same city as us, and we invited them over for dinner. Immediately upon entering the home, their mood changed.\n\nI think their sensitivity and vulnerability must have been extremely high after this. It must have been jarring to then walk into complete changes without a heads up that where they normally might feel closest to their daughter is no longer there (a married child's house is like the grown up version of their room at home...it's an expression of their life a parent can walk into and feel immediately and immersively included or an extended safe space parents can subconsciously pretend their child is when they don't have eyes on them). They were visiting as parents but arrived as guests, if that makes sense. Kind of like if a student moves away from their family for the very first time and lives on campus, then visits their childhood home and parents, ready to sit in their favorite chair and eat the family recipe homemade mac and cheese, only to find that not only is their chair gone, but their room has been torn apart, redesigned, and reassigned to their step sibling and the household is now vegan. If they had known that the step sibling living at home meant this could happen and there was some renovation taking place (so that it would no longer be the childhood home they visit for nostalgic comfort of simpler times), \"home\" (and all it entailed) could have started dissolving in their mind before they saw it no longer existed to match the memories, making it easier to accept the changes as transformation for now instead of elimination of before.\n\nThe way this played out (especially getting upset about the wedding pictures) was not logical in anyway, but that's grief for you.\n\nIt wasn't necessarily an AH move to not give them a heads up, but it would have been more inline with the sensitive and empathetic impression you had left on them.\n\nI think meeting them elsewhere will always be a good idea if their grandkids are in the same city as you/visited on the same trip, especially as they get older, so your husband can still preserve their connection. That relationship is how he can cherish what his late wife brought into his life and honor her in controlled, finite moments, no photos required, while fully thriving in the life you're building together. Hopefully they can see that and see how lucky they are that even though their daughter is no longer here, the son they gained because of her can live the life she would have wanted for him, because of you.\n\nWishing you the best.", "We are planning to have kids.

Grief is messy, it makes you long for people and experiences we cannot have again. He dealt with his grief a long time ago and he no longer desires that his memories of her keep him warm at night. \n\nLife is a gift. It\u2019s a beautiful experience.

It\u2019s a tough thing to navigate and it came together beautifully. \n\nI understand why the mother acted that way. It was a pure emotional reaction\u2026it must have been a shock to her. She was maybe expecting/hoping to feel reconnected with her daughter because it\u2019s the same house, but it hit her that it\u2019s a new home that doesn\u2019t involve her daughter. \n\nStill, she owes you an apology.

He and I both felt that going to his late wife\u2019s grave was a little different than say, a familial member\u2019s grave, because of who she was to him, his late partner. \n\nSo it wasn\u2019t the most appropriate thing to do and set a weird precedent for our relationship - that she was on his mind enough for him to go and make the drive to the grave, when his current partner was right there. We both came to this resolution together.\n\nSecond, most of her belongings are donated or given away, and we didn\u2019t know what to do with the few photos of her childhood she had. So we boxed them up and put them away, should anyone request them. We were just trying to do the right thing here.\n\n\n\nReplying to u/Bing147 , think you\u2019ve blocked me but here\u2019s my word: \n\nHe is a former widower because he is a husband. My husband. He is no longer tied to her. He can\u2019t be both. Whenever he signs an important form, his status is \u201chusband\u201d and not a \u201cwidower\u201d - and that distinction is important even from an emotion\u2019s perspective. \n\nShe was a chapter in his life. I am the continuation as long as I live for, maybe his whole life. \n\nI am not threatened by her because she\u2019s dead. She might have had him first but I have him now. That\u2019s what matters to me. Who he ends up with, matters the most. \n\nHe told me her memories don\u2019t keep him warm at night, he dealt with his grief long time ago, so I absolutely knows that even though he might think about her from time to time, it doesn\u2019t consume his life. It doesn\u2019t inspire any action in him. He doesn\u2019t actively love her. Because he has me. He tells me everyday that I am his greatest strength. \n\nAlso, I have mentioned this before, I don\u2019t play around with hypotheticals. I don\u2019t need to worry about the fact if he forgets me because present matters the most. It would be the same as asking, if the afterlife were real, who would be his mate? \n\nNah, I am better than playing games with my own head", "She is not his MIL. My mom is. Late wife\u2019s mom WAS his MIL - currently former MIL. \n\nI am his wife.", "He didn't have to communicate anything to his ex- mil. It's been 7 years since she isn't his mil anymore, she doesn't have any input in how he lives his life. I would understand if they had kids, but they don't, so her opinion is irrelevant.", "Of course it would\u2019ve been nice to give her a heads up but what we do with those pictures, whether we put them up or put them away, is really none of her business. \n\nWe stored her belongings in a box inside the storage and my husband is my husband now.

That terminated it. No, she isn't still his mil. And he definitely doesn't have to live his life according to her wishes or give any kind of explanation to her", "Umm.. that would imply the late wife is still his wife. Which isn\u2019t true at all. Marriage means \u201ctill death do us part\u201d - his only obligation to the promises he made to her were until the time she passed. There is virtually no other marital commitment now until I became his wife. \n\nI didn\u2019t marry an already married man. He doesn\u2019t have two wives. So he doesn\u2019t have two sets of in laws. I am his wife, so his only in laws now are my parents.", "You don\u2019t know anything about our relationship. Or him. I have no incentive to lie here. \n\nJust because I happen to have an actual relationship with someone who\u2019s widowed doesn\u2019t mean you have to get mean about it. Because I\u2018ve met your kind too \n\nStop projecting", "Don't listen to this guy, op. That's your house now and neither of you owe that lady an explanation. Maybe now she'll get the gist that she should butt out of your lives  and you won't have to put up with her ass anymore", "So he should cut off her family completely and ignore the relationship he had with them as soon as she died? which is what I think you actually want and would likely happen gradually/naturally.  If your husband dies will you no longer have a relationship with his parents?\n\nI don't think you're the ah for redecorating at all. Him giving her a heads up things have changed in the house would have been nice so it wasn't a complete blindside and I think she reacted emotionally, another reminder that her daughter is no longer alive and life is moving on.\n\nBut your comments make you appear quite aggressive and not as compassionate as the way you've worded your post.\n\nIt sounds like If he had kids you would expect their memory of their mum to be confined to their room and there should be no evidence of her elsewhere in the home because it's yours now not the home they had with their mum. I know that's hypothetical but the impression I get.  \n\nDoes your husband visit her grave? Honour her on her birthday? How do you feel if  he does? A bit jealous I mean she was his greatest love first because he married her first, if she hadn't died you wouldn't be his wife now.\n\nI don't think you're as ok with being the second wife as you make out.", "I'm impressed by how well I called it.  You fooled a lot of people on Reddit. \n\nGood luck with your husband", "If I actually believed in cutting off a former in law, I wouldn\u2019t have invited her at all. Let\u2019s get this straight. I appreciate their friendship and bond that they have, but not as my husband\u2019s in-laws. Because his actual in-laws are my parents, as he is MY husband. I don\u2019t share that, never will, and I don\u2019t think anybody should have to. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t visit her grave, or celebrate her birthdays or any day really. It\u2019s just any other normal day for us. I am not jealous that she had him first, because I have him now and that\u2019s all that matters.\n\nWe have a happy married life primarily because we focus on OUR relationship and what makes us happy as a couple.

If I didn\u2019t read your comments I would have said NTA, but your comments are cold and dismissive to his deceased wife. \n\nI think you\u2019re not noticing there\u2019s a huge difference between a divorce and a widow. Two major reasonings for this are- \n\nYour view of him visiting her grave setting a weird precedent for your relationship is pretty unhealthy. There\u2019s no damage to your relationship by visiting his deceased wife. He deserves that outlet, yesterday, today and in ten years. \n\nSaying things like \u201che doesn\u2019t actively love her because he has you\u201d is also not helping him. He loves her, he will always love her, it wasn\u2019t his choice to not spend forever with her. That doesn\u2019t mean he loves you any less. \n\nMy boyfriend\u2019s first wife died. His second wife he divorced and has kids with, then there\u2019s me. We all (including the second wife and kids) go to the first wife\u2019s grave every single year, every holiday, every birthday. Both myself and his second wife love her because she loved him and is apart of him. I couldn\u2019t imagine not being grateful and respectful of her. \n\nYou married a widower. You becoming his new wife didn\u2019t erase his other wife. You don\u2019t get to choose how he copes or how he moves forward. I think some therapy is in order for all parties before resentfulness sets in.", "YTA.. when I first read your post I was on your side. Then I read your comments and they were crazy!! You did not just re-decorate you pressured him into getting rid of anything that would remind him of her including all photos. That\u2019s creepy and weird.", "YTA. I am shocked you won't allow him to visit her grave. If you died, wouldn't you want to be remembered??", "INFO: Did your husband not give his former in-laws a heads up he was redecorating?

If you both wanted a fresh start, why didn't your husband move into your house, or you both sell your homes, and buy a new one together?", "YTA from your comments jeez!! You are so insecure and jealous of a dead woman it's sad. There is a difference between an ex and a passed loved one. That IS his dead wife, and it appears if she didn't die they would still be living in a loving marriage now. Instead of having respect and appreciating this, you have made it very clear to him that she is to be forgotten and never spoken of or else it would be disrespectful to you.\n\n You mention a bunch of times how he has said that he reconciles this in his mind by the fact that his dead wife can't cuddle him at night so if he wants love and affection he must sacrifice her memory completely. I hope one day he leaves you and finds someone who actually cares about him and his feelings and not someone willing to stomp all over a vulnerable person. His first inlaws have ever right to be disappointed by their SIL's downgrade. \n\nYou say you don't hurt yourself by wondering if he will be reunited with her after death but you sure do mention it a lot for someone who claims they don't think about it.

Would you do the same if you had a child who died? \"Well, now that I have a new child, I'd better pack away all reminders of the dead one; after all, visiting their grave will take away from my capacity to exist in the present!\" This whole attitude is just so weird to me.", "Good lord, read op's comments before deciding.\n\n\"What relationship does she bear to him?

I remember that a friend of mine who lost her son cried about it the last time upon being informed that his fiance was getting married.  It was the last time it really hit her that he wasn't coming back.\n\nYou're right that you have the right to make the home your own if the two of you didn't decide to move somewhere more neutral.  The one thing it might have been a good idea to do was for him to gently warn them that the house was going to look very different and reflect that you're now present.  Part of that means that, yes - it was time for him to store pictures of her since there weren't kids involved (if there were, that's alot more complicated).  You need to know that you're not competing with a ghost in a battle you would never win.  You need to be comfortable in your own home.  Your husband has the right to have a life partner again.\n\nI think she may just have been in shock seeing the house changed for the first time if she hadn't been reminded to prepare herself for it.  Try not to take it personally.  It was railing against fate, not a personal attack on you.\n\nNow, however, she knows, and knows how it's going to hit her at least for a while.  She deserved one strike - now she has to not attack you in your own home.  If she can't do that, it might be time for him to start disconnecting from them.  That often happens organically when someone acquires a new partner in the fullness of time if no kids are involved and the widow(er) didn't know their in-laws well enough to have been super close to them.  It might be too painful and better to just wish eachother well.", "You have every right to do it, but your husband should have warned them. Actually, since they are only now tangentially related, you guys could have met them at a restaurant. If he's going to keep them in his life, he has to be more thoughtful about this transition. Blindsiding them with the house changes was a terrible thing to do, they deserved a chance to take that information in and prepare themselves. I don't get why they have to come over at all, seems like this sort of thing is inevitable as long as you are there and he's living his life without their daughter.

She is, at best, a deeply insecure and self-centered woman, lacking basic empathy and emotional depth, who should never have gotten into a relationship with a widower. She sees his late wife as an \"ex\" and a challenge to her relationship, and has sought to erase her not only from their home but from every aspect of his life.\n\nIt's not healthy or healing, it's controlling and reeks of jealousy and childishness. \n\nLook, I see it this way:\n\nI dated a widower and honestly, perhaps it was because he was only a couple of years out from her death and still grieving, but it felt very meaningful and important to me to INCLUDE his feelings about her, and to talk about her, as part of our growing relationship. \n\nShe was his whole world for over a decade, and then he had to live through the life-changing experience of watching this young woman die from a slow, painful illness. For me to try to erase her or even just quietly ignore her importance to him would have felt equally ugly and like I was ignoring a part of him. I didn't feel jealous or challenged by her memory. I felt curious, about who this wonderful woman was who would have been so loved by this man I cared about.\n\nSo I told him from the outset: \"You don't have to talk about her if it's painful, but I would love to know about her, as much as you WANT to talk about her. About your life together, about who she was. I want you to feel like you don't have to push her or your memories out of your life. I hope we will make new memories, but I want to also know who this amazing woman was who made you love her so much, and I hope she will always be a part of your life. That's fine by me. If anything, I think it's important.\" He was so relieved and grateful. \n\nOur relationship didn't last, for entirely other reasons, but if I was ever with another widower I would do exactly the same. A secure and loving partnership does not require erasing GOOD, MEANINGFUL MEMORIES from someone's past. It should ENCOMPASS them and carry them forward as part and parcel of building something new.\n\nOP, YTA. What you are doing is not creating a \"fresh start\". You can do that without cruelty or erasure. You can do that whilst including mementoes of a loved and loving past. You can create a home that is yours while still keeping a photo or two, an album, a favourite chair or knickknack from your husband's late wife, that her memory might bless your happy new home together. Your post reeks of insecurity and jealousy of a woman long gone. You need therapy.", "OP, just one thing makes YTA: failing to have enough empathy to foresee that this would probably happen. The bereaved parents should have been given plenty of warnings and the option to meet instead at a restaurant. \n\nMIL and her daughter would have made many shared memories in that house. It must've reflected the daughter's personality, and her energy would have remained tangible as though she had just stepped out not died. (Which is why you understandably sought a completely new look that removed every trace.) How could you not know that the loss of those touchstones would be to her mother like a 2nd death? \n\nOr did you know and not care?

Maybe FMIL was also wondering where all of the late wife\u2019s extra belongings went, etc. and why she didn\u2019t get them.\n\nEdit: saw OP\u2019s comments\u2026 changing my judgment. YTA, OP. The wife is DEAD. Have some compassion. Jfc. Everyone should read OP\u2019s comment history before making a judgment. She literally doesn\u2019t allow her husband to even talk about the late wife or visit her grave. Smh", "This.  OP didn't have to respond in such a hostile way.  Surely she and her husband could have anticipated that his former in laws might be shocked and hurt upon seeing the transformation and navigated their visit gently.  They should have been given some warning.  Are all the photos of his first wife put away?", "But he\u2019s moved on, he\u2019s even removed everything from the home, even photos mementos of their daughter. It not narrow minded imo. It\u2019s just realizing it\u2019s time to let go of the relationship with him and move on as well", "Of course ex-in laws don't get a say, but being a bereaved parent is one of the worse things anyone can go through, and seeing the impact of your child disappear is a massive trigger. A heads up from their ex-SIL before they walk into the situation would've been courteous.", "I think this is absolutely what happened. FMIL likely looked forward to the dinner, partially, as a way to \u201cfeel\u201d their late daughter. And to walk into a house that is 10000% stripped of her would be shocking to the system, absolutely.", "Sell one house buy a new one. Or sell it and live in the home she had before they started living together", "Photo albums? Sure, but not family photos framed on the wall....", "[removed]", "It sounds like MIL was especially upset that the wedding photos were gone.\n\nI can't imagine having wedding photos of my husband and his deceased wife displayed in the living room next to mine.\n\nI don't think your husband needs to get rid of them entirely but it doesn't seem unreasonable to me not wanting all those pictures displayed in your home.\n\nI wonder if people would still feel she needs to be represented in your home if you had sold & bought a new one, or just because this was the home she lived in.\n\nI don't think you did anything wrong. If anything ever happened to me I would hate to think the memory of me prevented my partner from moving on.\n\nI do sympathise with her mother. Try to show as much grace as you can.", "It seems a little unhealthy he doesn't have even one photo to remember someone who passed away who he was close to for decades. \n\nHim being a widow at one point and having loved before you shouldn't be something he's ashamed of. You loved before him.", "Honestly OP, as much as you\u2019re NTA for redecorating with your husband\u2026you also have to realize that his former MIL will probably never be rational about this. Losing a child changes a person, even if their \u2018child\u2019 was an adult. Your husband\u2019s former MIL will never get over her daughter\u2019s death. She will be reminded of her daughter *every time* she sees you doing something that her daughter didn\u2019t get to do. Every milestone, big or small, will be like ripping open that wound again. Your husband has a new wife, while they just have a big hole that will never be filled.\n\nMy friend\u2019s little sister died. It\u2019s been well over a decade. Their mom still grieves the things that should\u2019ve been. \u201cShe would\u2019ve been going to her first homecoming dance tonight.\u201d \u201cShe would\u2019ve been starting driver\u2019s ed with all her friends today.\u201d \u201cShe would\u2019ve graduated high school tonight.\u201d \u201cWe would\u2019ve been dropping her off at college for the first time this weekend.\u201d And on and on and on. All of the events and milestone that her friends/classmates have gone through, have been fresh sources of grief.\n\nIf your husband wants to have a relationship with his former PILs, these big waves of grief are something you\u2019ll have to contend with. Just as your husband was entitled to move on and have a happy life, they\u2019re entitled to their feelings. Having a good relationship with former PILs could be as simple as giving them a heads up next time, instead of surprising them with something that could be upsetting. If the two of you aren\u2019t willing to handle their grief gently, and give them space to process or even vent about their feelings, don\u2019t keep adding to their pain - it may be time to close that chapter and end the relationship.", "Ok now I get why the mom was upset. You have a right to be happy, but I can see how she would feel her daughter had been completely erased by your husband. He can love you, and still keep something of his first wife to remember their life together. It\u2019s interesting you mentioned it was a decision made by both of you. I think it should have been solely his decision. Because she was his first love(I assume because they were high school sweethearts ) and his wife. It was a life they had together, it has nothing to do with you.", "That is so fucked up.", ">Obviously the dialogue was opened by me but it was entirely a choice for both of us and our relationship to move forward. No, there aren\u2019t any photos or mementos.\n\n\"Both of us\" makes me think you pressured him over the years. Not a single photo? That's pretty heartless, and I can see why his MIL is upset", "Maybe consider giving those belongings to your husbands former in Laws. Sort of in a \"we didn't erase her entirely and throw her memory out\" which is probably where former MILs mind went.", "I thought you said there were no pictures left  in the house? Which is it?", "Idk man, OPs comments are pretty cold. Even just the comment above makes it sound like the late wife shouldn't have a place in his memories at all.", "Bruh this is still cold as shitm it doesnt have to be the worst of the worst to be evil. OP is literally cold as shit", "God you even talked him out of going to her grave? Geez are you that threaten by a dead woman?", "Hate to break it to you, he definitely goes to her grave. He just doesn\u2019t tell you.", "I think most of what you say is fine and mostly agree with it. Years later upon remarriage I likely wouldn't have tons of pictures and things. I'd be trying to build something new.\n\nBut I do think the attitude you display here is a bit toxic. Marrying a widower is not the same as marrying someone who got divorced. Their love never ended, only her life did. Assuming you actually loved the person that never fully goes away. The pain never fully dissipates. It softens and changes. It reaches a point where it's not the only thing you can remember. But it's always there. He's not a former widower. That's not a thing. His wife died. He had a life with her. That will always be part of his story. That doesn't mean he can't build a new chapter with you but it's built on the foundation of the chapters that came before. \n\nI guarantee you he thinks about her at times. That's not something he necessarily shares with you, but it happens and it isn't a problem. She's dead. Theres no need to compete with a ghost. Shes not coming back around the corner. His love for her does not diminish his love for you.  But you sure won't find any therapists who will tell you that when those thoughts come up the healthy choice is to ignore them and pretend they don't exist. The issue here isn't that he doesn't think about her, he almost certainly does. Huge portions of his past are tied up with her. The issue is that he feels he needs to hide that and you discourage healthy outlets for it such as visiting her grave. You say it's a decision you came to together but you brought it up. That really doesn't work. By bringing it up you set an expectation. Even if he's presumably agreed there's an inherent pressure there which isn't fully escapable. \n\nAs someone who loves him I struggle to see how you can't get that. Would you be comfortable with the idea that he could one day forget you? That after your death his love for you would simply vanish without a trace? That doesn't sound like any love I've ever seen or particularly healthy.", "He doesn't visit her grave? Wow....what shitty people.", "I'm not angry. I'm just confused; why do you want to keep her belongings so badly? Oh, and I use capital letters to emphasize, not scream.\n\nI'm not judging you or him for not visiting her grave once a year (well I am but I'm not talking about that and I won't talk about your agreement about his late wife's grave). I'm saying if he doesn't even visit her grave he doesn't care about cherishing her. Which makes it NOT okay to keep her belongings. Why does he need to keep someone he doesn't care belongings? You two can give her memories (because they also belong to her, not just your hubby) who would love to cherish her memories. I'm pretty sure you would love to have that space to keep your own memories considering that both of you want to act like she was never born. \n\nAs for the request thing; consider her mom's cry as her request and give his late wife's belongings to her parents so that they can cherish her and cut contact with them. Because if you are going to pretend like they never had a daughter why keep them in your life?", ">Second, most of her belongings are donated or given away\n\nYou donated them to his late wife's family, right? You gave them away to his late wife's family, right? And you'll do the same with the photos?\n\nI am hoping you two weren't so unkind as to hand them to charity shops when there are grieving parents and family members, who would be overjoyed to be reunited with their late daughters belongings.", "He\u2019ll be with her in the afterlife so it\u2019s great you don\u2019t believe in it \ud83d\udc4d", ">He and I both felt that going to his late wife\u2019s grave was a little different than say, a familial member\u2019s grave, because of who she was to him, his late partner.\n\n\nSpouses are your family, or are you so cold hearted you don\u2019t see that?", "YOU ARE THE DEVIL!", "Also he only views you as a warm body and I don\u2019t think your marriage will last as long as you live, so good luck with that.", "I was fully with you on the main post, but Holy shit these comments here make you sound like a mega asshole", "Girlie pop YOU ARE THERE BY CHANCE. If his wife hadn\u2019t of died HE WOULDNT HAVE CHOSE YOU.", "A picture of the late spouse isn\u2019t about you, nor about your relationship. If it is, as you suggest, you have some serious insecurity issues.", "He only chose you because he had to. His first wife, his first love, died. He didn't want to have to choose someone else until life forced his hand. You have a nasty attitude about his late wife (not ex, late wife), about your husband, about the in laws, about everything. You sound overbearing and demanding. The fact that your husband didn't say anything to the MIL speaks volumes. So do you, apparently.", "He didn\u2019t choose you though. You can tell yourself that all you want but everyone knows it\u2019s true, including you deep down. That\u2019s why you are so adamant in your need to completely erase her. Your previous comment about an afterlife\u2026. If there is an afterlife, he will be with her in it. You know this and so does he. If you were more secure in yourself and he was able to properly remember his one true love while in this relationship with you, you would have a chance at eventually being someone he chose. Your insecurity has ruined that as has your extremely unhealthy obsession with pretending she didn\u2019t exist. He may be your current husband, but he will always be a widow and nothing you attempt to do will ever change that.", "Dead of previous partner in marriage does not mean the marriage was over.\n\nThis statement is telling.", "People discuss their house renos all the time. \n\nThey must have had some discussion to arrange their visit, he could have told her \"you'll notice some changes, we've done a lot of work on the house.\"", "[removed]", "I don't think any reminder is necessary - OP's husband didn't have children with her, so any honouring of her memory can be done by him privately. \n\nI've read OP's comment history - unless she's lying, it sounds like her husband has made decisions about how he feels about his first marriage and he's choosing not to focus on it. I admit, I find it a bit weird and some of his comments seem a bit cold, but it's working for them. Clearly OP hasn't banned him from talking about his late wife because he's still in contact with his in-laws from the first marriage. I don't think it's entirely unnatural for OP to ask that he discusses his memories or feelings for his first wife with someone else rather than her - it's a tricky situation to navigate, they've found a system that works for them.", "Nope, they ERASED her. OP is a massive ahole.", "That again assumes that their only connection is through the daughter and they don't have a relationship of their own. \n\nI didn't say narrow minded, I said narrow set of experiences. Those are very different things. You seem to see relationships with a spouses family as something that exist only for the sake of the spouse. And sure, that's often a thing. My father in law is a decent enough guy but we aren't close. When we see each other we make small talk. I can hang with him for a few hours. I don't dislike him. But we have nothing in common. I'm not sure we've ever had a conversation much deeper than asking how work is going. If my wife died I'd stay in touch initially but slowly drift away to the point where he probably still gets a Christmas card but not much more.\n\nSometimes though you build a relationship all your own. My brother in law is genuinely one of my favorite people. I'm closer to him than one of my actual brothers. We talk about everything including very personal stuff. Our relationship is not done in service of my wife. It's between us. Even if my wife died he'd be in my life forever. If I was getting remarried he'd be at the wedding. If everyone felt comfortable probably in the wedding party. \n\nMoving away from that relationship is fine if he wants to but it's not inherently the right choice because there's pain within the relationship. Most relationships if they go long enough have some pain in them. They often have far more as well though. Those people are his family, at least as long as both sides want that to be the case.", "People aren't things to be replaced and relationships can evolve.", "Or just do whatever works for the couple? \n\nNot everyone is haunted by previous spouses at every turn.

Being widowed is not the same as being divorced.", "Stop extrapolating.", "Dude get help. This level of obsession over some photos you don\u2019t even know about is crazy", "I honestly think you have either a reading comprehension deficit and/or a reasoning deficit. They have answered the question about the items. You wanna go through their attic and get the stuff to give to dead girls Mom? Jfc. Get it together.", "This is a point I made in this thread. She shouldn\u2019t have been a part of any decisions regarding his first wife and how he moved on . It\u2019s already been mentioned but I\u2019m sure the husband thinks of wife #1 but he can\u2019t say anything because he knows wife # 2 doesn\u2019t want to be reminded that she\u2019s with her husband because he\u2019s 1st  wife died", ">So he should cut off her family completely and ignore the relationship he had with them as soon as she died?\n\nYou\u2019re setting up a false dichotomy here. Nothing here suggests going NC with the former in-laws but they also don\u2019t get a say home decoration.", "But she did die. And he made the choice to move forward with another relationship. His first marriage is over. He may not have wanted it to be over, but it is. He can't live in this \"we'd still be married if she hadn't died\" headspace if he expects to have a healthy romantic relationship in his life.", "The marriage ended with her death, regardless of choice. By every metric it\u2019s over. One person can\u2019t be in a marriage when the other no longer exists.", "I hope people still visit my grave after 7 years. It\u2019s not much time at all, in any way. \n\nI don\u2019t think people are arguing that the husband and wife shouldn\u2019t be allowed to create a beautiful life of their own. The issue is the callousness in the attitude towards the late wife.", "That's a divorce and entirely different because OPs husbands previous wife DIED.", "No I get that, but in this case the relationship is causing the MIL to have emotional breakdowns in the newly renovated home. It\u2019s causing more harm than good. And from the looks of it the new wife isn\u2019t really a fan of the relationship. I can see it causing arguments at some point. Plus the SIL has completely moved on. He doesn\u2019t even have a picture of his 1st wife any more. So it\u2019s time to let go, for everyone\u2019s sake", "This has not been a discussion. Discussions share ideas. This has been you scolding me and the way you write is hostile. Telling someone they have no right and it\u2019s none of their business- is not discussing. So please stop", "A spouse who died and an ex are really not the same thing at all and treating them as if they are is messed up. *You* are not being a good partner if you make him feel like he has to discard or hide everything from that time of his life to make you happy.\n\nMy husband died when we were in our 20s and my current fianc\u00e9 is just fine with having some photos of him around with all of the other family photos because my late husband *is* family.", "Yeah but if she didn\u2019t die, you wouldn\u2019t be anything to him. So not even one photo to honor her is crazy!", "So he doesn't even have a picture in a memory box somewhere? That's a little strange.", "Well. I hadn\u2019t seen that comment which is just as fucked. Mine was cremated, so she was technically in the house. Which I also didn\u2019t care. You can\u2019t just erase a loss like that. It\u2019s pretty fucked up. Though I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s allowing her to be erased from his memory either.", "Yikes! \n\nIf OP passed away I imagine she\u2019d want her husband to visit her grave. It\u2019s not like the late wife can leap out of the grave and steal her man back!!!!!", "Yes, exactly. With time, it\u2019s now down to the one picture I mentioned that we have up of her. But I never asked him to put any away. He eventually did it himself. And that\u2019s how it should be.", "WHAAAAT\n\nYour husband\u2019s experiences \u2014 the relationship and her death \u2014 absolutely are your concern. They were foundational experiences to who he is. Everything you love about him, everything you cherish about his kindness and love, was likely sculpted by this woman. \n\nYou think he\u2019d be the same husband to you if he\u2019d been single and dating for all of that time, instead of learning to be in a marriage with his high school sweetheart?\n\nNo, you don\u2019t need to know her. But it\u2019s ignorant of you to pretend like she has no bearing whatsoever on your husband and relationship.", "I agree it\u2019s not your concern. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t get why you were a part of the decision in how he moved on. I\u2019m going to sound harsh, I\u2019m sorry if this offends you. But you come across as a bit cold, and like you don\u2019t understand grief.  Its clear you don\u2019t understand the mom\u2019s POV. Honestly I don\u2019t know why they are a part of your life with your husband. And now thinking about it, I wonder if it\u2019s a way for your husband to hold on to a piece of his 1st wife because he doesn\u2019t have anything else.", "Does he maintain any other connection with his late wife? Does he visit her grave? I know from losing someone myself that a denial of the persons existence, like not looking at photos, isn\u2019t healthy. \n\nI think as long as he can talk about her, and still mourn her when he needs to, because he will miss her sometimes, is good enough. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d still have one picture of her in the house, and I\u2019d be ok with that if I was the partner of a widower too. That being said, ad long as he\u2019s not burring his emotions and memory of her entirely I think it\u2019s ok you don\u2019t have pictures of her in the house. \n\nIf however he isn\u2019t talking about her, or visiting her grave on her birthday for example, then that\u2019s a good sign he\u2019s might be going through a period of denial where it\u2019s easier to pretend she never existed than accept the loss. \n\nAlso, if her parents ever came over again, maybe just having a framed photo of her to pull out when they visit might be a kind thing to do for them. You could always pack it away after they leave", "Read OP\u2019s comments, she is *awful*.", ">extrapolating\n\nNah, we're just reading what's clearly written.\n\nYou need a therapist, OP.", "JFC... you're the one who needs help, lady. The fact that you have no emotion over any of this when strangers clearly do should be having alarm bells going off for you.", "That part!", "You literally came to Reddit to ask if you were an asshole - your original post sounded fairly reasonable, your comments reveal you to be a fully fledged unadulterated asshole. You are now arguing with everyone that they don\u2019t know you or your life and can\u2019t judge you or your relationship\u2026.you literally posted to be judged.\nIn actual fact, your words reveal you to be incredibly self obsessed and insecure.\nThere is nothing wrong with the contents of your original post, but the attitude you have toward a dead woman, the remnants of her life and your husbands marriage and life before you is so sad and makes your husbands MIL\u2019s (sorry, your insecurity requires me to specify FORMER) reaction likely very understandable. If in just a few online comments it\u2019s so clear to all of us how cruel your attitude towards this woman and her life is, I\u2019m sure her mother has more than picked up on that and that must be so painful.\n\nYou do not want your husband to move on, you want him to pretend his ex never mattered. \u2018She\u2019s just an old friend now\u2019\n\nThis is one of the saddest things I\u2019ve seen on Reddit, the fact that your happiness depends on doing all you can to wipe the life she lived and the love she gave and had away. It\u2019s so so tragic.\n\nPlease leave that poor woman\u2019s family alone, and rest safe in the knowledge that yes -  most certainly YTA", "Y'all some people can't handle getting rid of their dead loved ones stuff on their own. Even if it is every day stuff. A family member had some of her deceased husband's belongings, old hats and bookbags and even though she didn't want it and felt it was mostly clutter, she didn't want his family to think she as being disrespectful to his memory but its all junk. I helped her clean out her house a few months ago and anything his kids and his mom didn't want, I donated and threw away for her because it was junk. She had kept that stuff for 5 years because going through it alone was overwhelming for her. You shouldn't judge a stranger's motive when we know nothing about his thoughts on what happened.", "Girl you are sounding more and more vindictive, jealous, insecure, and small-hearted the more comments I read.\n\n\u201cWE decided it was best he delete his former wife completely.  He\u2019s MINE now HAHA.\u201d\n\nYikes.", "Well you are wrong. They are your husbands inlaws and always will be. \n\nBoth you and your husband don't sound emotionally healthy at all. He should be talking about her, remembering her, visiting her grave. She is his late wife.", "I\u2019m not saying he should think of himself as  still  married to her, but it\u2019s different than a divorce. With OP part of the decision making process he removed all pics mementoes from the house. Although later she\u2019s said they were in the attic so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. And \u201ctogether\u201d they also decided he won\u2019t visit the grave anymore. There\u2019s moving on and then there\u2019s this situation where it seems op needed to completely erase the years her husband had with wife #1  so she could feel comfortable", "Okay? He's still allowed to continue to have a relationship with his FAMILY. Family isn't just blood. Family is who you choose. If OPs husband wants to continue to have a relationship with his in laws then that is not up to OP. If she doesn't like it she can leave. But she doesn't get a say. It's not her relationship to determine if it's okay for him to keep or not. Nor is it ours.", "Same if my mom died. My dad would still be considered my grandparents son. Divorced or dead,  if my parents were no longer together, my grandparents would continue their relationship with my dad. Again, we joke about them keeping him in a divorce, forget if something happened to my mom. \n\nYou literally proved my point more for me \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd26", "You\u2019re telling someone what they should do with their house and you think you\u2019re being helpful? No were you crossing a line and someone needed to tell you that. She asked a question all you had to do was give your opinion on what she was asking not give unsolicited advice. She doesn\u2019t need criticism she is getting plenty of that from her husbands ex in-laws. If you\u2019re on her side be supportive don\u2019t also try to knock her down by saying what she did was technically wrong cause she could have got a new house. When people are wrong or overstepping they need someone to let them know instead of letting them continue which is exactly what you did when telling her that she should have sold her house and I jumped in to tell you that\u2019s not your place and she wasnt asking so stay out of it. she wanted to know if she was wrong for redecorating as in should she have kept it as the late wife had it or was she within her right to redecorate, no where in there did she ask if she should move cause that was never in the cards for her and her husband.", "I don\u2019t have to tell him to hide or discard or anything. But we are both cognisant of the fact that both instances can bring up similar unproductive feelings. \n\nHe knows his shit. He takes on his role as a good partner. I am his family.", "I mean she seems a bit controlling. I can\u2019t imagine the memory of my late spouse becoming some kind of negative obsession with my current one. Maybe he\u2019s just exhausted by it and does what she wants.", "I didn\u2019t make him move on. He was far ahead in his journey when we met. All we had was a discussion where I voiced how I felt about his progress, and what his views were on getting into a relationship again after experiencing a loss like that. \n\nWe both were compatible on how we thought about love, and that\u2019s why we are married today", "Why is she awful though?\n\nBecause she's not memorialing someone she did not know in her own home? It is solely up to that grown man to choose if wants to have a space in his home for a dead person or the living people there. I don't get how that makes OP bad. If he did not want to move on he would not have. He is a grown up, he can make up his own mind and if he chose to please his now wife over a dead one, it still doesn't make OP the bad guy", "Why should he do that if he doesn\u2019t want to? They didn\u2019t have kids together and it sounds like he wants to move on. He has the right to move past this situation and deal with it how he sees fit.", "That\u2019s his choice though and how he wants to move on. Everyone doesn\u2019t want to memorialize a dead person forever, and that\u2019s ok. If they had kids it would be different."]}
