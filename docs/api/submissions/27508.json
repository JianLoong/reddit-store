I think this would have worked better. \n\nWhy were those people invited over?", "NTA.  It\u2019s normal to want your home to reflect you are your husbands life together and tastes.  It\u2019s your home.  On the flip side it\u2019s also normal for someone to be upset when something their daughter was a part of is now gone.  She went to far blaming you but it\u2019s understandable she would be upset.  It\u2019s not your fault though.  It\u2019s something she just needs to work through.  It\u2019s not fair for her to take it out on you though as if you did something wrong.", "NTA. It's understandable that she'd be upset, but that's not on you. It was appropriate for you and your husband to redecorate.\n\nGive her some time. Hopefully she'll come to understand that the redecorating is no reflection on her daughter or the life she shared with your husband.\n\nIt's possible she won't get over it, and they'll drift away from your husband, and that's ok, too.\n\nNone of that is a reflection on you or your husband in any way.", "NTA. It's your home now, with your new husband. You were harassed and yelled at, so it's perfectly understandable that you lost your patience, anyone would after some time.\n\nI do understand their pain and even what made their react how they did as they saw the house as a \"Sanctuary\" of their daughter, and seeing it changed was a painful reminder of it.  \nMy suggestion is, when everyone calm down, and if your husband is ok with it, to give them some of her belongings, like wedding photos (or make copies of it for them).", "NTA. \n\nthey are grieving but you are right. their daughter unfortunately no longer with them. and its wrong for them to be expecting the husband to be holding onto that memory when he is starting a new life with you. your husband could have given the former FIL a heads-up just in case to avoid this situation. but you are absolutely in right here.", "NTA. I really don\u2019t know what they were expecting. Your house isn\u2019t a museum for their daughter & it\u2019s almost been a decade since she died. Your husband is allowed to move on.", "NTA. They obviously expected your husband not to move on with his life which is unfair and wrong. At best, he could have given them a polite \"heads up\" letting them know you've made changes. I can imagine it was a shock for them to be where they were previously surrounded by memories of her and they will always grieve the loss, but that doesn't justify her reaction.", "NTA \nYou have every right to decorate as y'all want. You did nothing wrong, she's just sad and grieving still.", "NTA. It\u2019s unreasonable for his former MIL to expect the house to remain unchanged forever.", "NTA why would YOUR husband have pics of him & his widow still hanging up in the house when he is now married to YOU?", "NAH.  \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong.  Your husband has a right to remarry and move on.  Sounds like there are no kids involved so it is normal for him to want to remodel his home with his new wife (you) and have a fresh start.  It is totally fine that he didn't want to keep up any photos of his first wife. \n\nIt is also normal that he has a relationship with the parents of his first wife.  They were his family and he was in love with their child and his shared grief will bond him to that family, possibly forever.  However, it is up to him to set healthy boundaries as they will not be able to do so. When parents lose a child it is the most difficult loss, even when that child is an adult.  For the parents, your husband and the home he shared with their daughter are a reminder of her.  His (your) house may have felt like a monument to them so seeing it remodeled is like seeing their daughters gravestone smashed to pieces.  Her reaction was coming from the grief that she holds every day, it wasn't rational and I am sure she could not really control it. You can't reason with pure emotion, and when it comes to a dead child, everything is pure emotion.  We can't fault them.  Life is just too painful sometimes.  Your husband is the only man their daughter ever loved:  so even if they (logically) are happy for him that he has found love again they will still find it painful to see ways where his life moves away from what it was with their daughter.  The house she lived in changing was like another piece of her disappearing from the world. It hurts. But if you don't know anyone personally who has been through the loss of a child then you wouldn't really know to expect a big reaction and warn them ahead of time.", "NTA.    They lost their daughter,  beyond sad.   However, Its now your house. Not hers. Not her daughters. Your life is not a novel where the dead person's things were not touched for ever and made a shrine", "NTA \u2026. not to be mean but she\u2019s isn\u2019t here anymore so they need to move on", "NTA We have to live for the living, not live in the shadow of the dead.", "NTA and seriously you handled it way better then I think I would have.", "NTA. It\u2019s not her daughter\u2019s house. She had no right to make those comments. She\u2019s misplacing her grief and it\u2019s not appropriate.", "NTA\n\n Ffs, did she expected you to live in a memorial house for her daughter?? Her daughter's dead, you didn't even knew her and that's your house. Honestly, why is this woman even involved in your life? I would understand if they had kids, but since they don't, why do you have to put up with her?? \n\n Consider this a blessing in disguise. Maybe she'll stop coming to your house and you'll get rid of her.", "NTA", "I think you are being kind. Of course you can't live in a shrine to her. Her mother cross a line by verbally attacking you.\n\nYou need boundaries. No more coming to the house. Stay more distant. Your husband needs to be clear that if they can't respect you and your lives moving in without their daughter then they need to stay quiet about it and not dump it in you and not dump it on him either.", "NTA. It is your home and you can decorate all you want. I\u2019m sure your husband was happy to give it a fresh start too. It\u2019s your moments and memories that are going to fill it. A house is meant to be lived in, and you can\u2019t do that if it\u2019s treated as a mausoleum.", "NTA. It sounds like the two of you enjoyed the renovations and it was a good idea.\n\nThe loss of his first wife is tragic. But if her parents want a shrine it should not be in your house let alone the entire house.\n\nMy husband passed away 7 years ago. My son and I after about 6 months went through his things in the house, boxed up and saved what he wanted. I saved what I wanted. The rest was trashed, donated or given to his family.\n\nFor her parents to expect no changes after your husband moved on and got married is unrealistic. Husband needs to explain this to them.\n\nI would suggest they aren't allowed in your home going forward. And maybe getting some distance would be good.", "NTA, but your husband sound have addressed his former MIL. She\u2019s obviously very much still grieving, but it\u2019s unreasonable to expect you to maintain her daughter\u2019s former home as some kind of shrine to her.", "NTA but this is 100% on your husband to address.  There\u2019s no reason for someone who treats you like a villain to be in your home.", "> It doesn't look like she even lives here\n\nShe doesn't.\n\nGod knows they're in an awful position but their assistant expectation that he'd live his life from **25** onwards as a living shrine to her was not just unrealistic but cruel.", "NAH. \n\nIt\u2019s you and your husbands home. However given this was the first time they visited and the house was completely different then when her daughter lived there; I understand how emotional she would have been due to her grief.", ">He doesn\u2019t visit her grave, or celebrate her birthdays or any day really. It\u2019s just any other normal day for us.\n\nAfter reading this just give his late wife's belongings to her parents, who cherish her, and move on. Staying away from them would be doing them a favor because he is acting like he never loved her and I think that photo thing was the last straw for his former MIL. She wanted to see that he was appreciating his late wife and he didn't. He doesn't seem like he really cares about her so why not just cut contact and stop torturing them?\n\nESH", "I think thats a good idea! If they want to see yall again, meet up somewhere else.", "ESH.  They see you as replacing her daughter and erasing her memory.  \n\nIt doesn't matter if you are intentionally doing it or not; they are having a hard time grieving and could use time with a therapist to talk about it.  \n\nP.S.

There is absolutely no reason you can't put away wedding photos.  No one wants to be reminded of their husband being married to someone else.

Life is about moving forward constructively. Your goal was not to eliminate her, but to fully establish you, as it should be.\n\n>His late wife\u2019s parents were visiting town to see some of their grand kids from his late wife\u2019s brother who lives in the same city as us, and we invited them over for dinner. Immediately upon entering the home, their mood changed.\n\nI think their sensitivity and vulnerability must have been extremely high after this. It must have been jarring to then walk into complete changes without a heads up that where they normally might feel closest to their daughter is no longer there (a married child's house is like the grown up version of their room at home...it's an expression of their life a parent can walk into and feel immediately and immersively included or an extended safe space parents can subconsciously pretend their child is when they don't have eyes on them). They were visiting as parents but arrived as guests, if that makes sense. Kind of like if a student moves away from their family for the very first time and lives on campus, then visits their childhood home and parents, ready to sit in their favorite chair and eat the family recipe homemade mac and cheese, only to find that not only is their chair gone, but their room has been torn apart, redesigned, and reassigned to their step sibling and the household is now vegan. If they had known that the step sibling living at home meant this could happen and there was some renovation taking place (so that it would no longer be the childhood home they visit for nostalgic comfort of simpler times), \"home\" (and all it entailed) could have started dissolving in their mind before they saw it no longer existed to match the memories, making it easier to accept the changes as transformation for now instead of elimination of before.\n\nThe way this played out (especially getting upset about the wedding pictures) was not logical in anyway, but that's grief for you.\n\nIt wasn't necessarily an AH move to not give them a heads up, but it would have been more inline with the sensitive and empathetic impression you had left on them.\n\nI think meeting them elsewhere will always be a good idea if their grandkids are in the same city as you/visited on the same trip, especially as they get older, so your husband can still preserve their connection. That relationship is how he can cherish what his late wife brought into his life and honor her in controlled, finite moments, no photos required, while fully thriving in the life you're building together. Hopefully they can see that and see how lucky they are that even though their daughter is no longer here, the son they gained because of her can live the life she would have wanted for him, because of you.\n\nWishing you the best.", "We are planning to have kids.

Grief is messy, it makes you long for people and experiences we cannot have again. He dealt with his grief a long time ago and he no longer desires that his memories of her keep him warm at night. \n\nLife is a gift. It\u2019s a beautiful experience.

It\u2019s a tough thing to navigate and it came together beautifully. \n\nI understand why the mother acted that way. It was a pure emotional reaction\u2026it must have been a shock to her. She was maybe expecting/hoping to feel reconnected with her daughter because it\u2019s the same house, but it hit her that it\u2019s a new home that doesn\u2019t involve her daughter. \n\nStill, she owes you an apology.

He and I both felt that going to his late wife\u2019s grave was a little different than say, a familial member\u2019s grave, because of who she was to him, his late partner. \n\nSo it wasn\u2019t the most appropriate thing to do and set a weird precedent for our relationship - that she was on his mind enough for him to go and make the drive to the grave, when his current partner was right there. We both came to this resolution together.\n\nSecond, most of her belongings are donated or given away, and we didn\u2019t know what to do with the few photos of her childhood she had. So we boxed them up and put them away, should anyone request them. We were just trying to do the right thing here.", "She is not his MIL. My mom is. Late wife\u2019s mom WAS his MIL - currently former MIL. \n\nI am his wife.", "He didn't have to communicate anything to his ex- mil. It's been 7 years since she isn't his mil anymore, she doesn't have any input in how he lives his life. I would understand if they had kids, but they don't, so her opinion is irrelevant.", "Of course it would\u2019ve been nice to give her a heads up but what we do with those pictures, whether we put them up or put them away, is really none of her business. \n\nWe stored her belongings in a box inside the storage and my husband is my husband now. He doesn\u2019t feel the need to bring his former wife in our relationship and we are more than happy to give all her pictures away to her mom.", "I\u2019m allowed to share my opinion. Just as you are sharing yours.", "I admire how clear you are in your thinking and communication about being a partner in your new lives. I wish you happiness.\n\nNTA", "So you're ok with the thought that if you died and your husband remarried he would never visit your grave?", "He was never divorced, and there was no termination of the relationship. \n\nShe is still his MIL.", "Let's upgrade you to YTA. \n\nBecause I've met your kind, and he didn't agree; you bullied him.", "You don\u2019t get to tell them what they should have done with THEIR home. Your advice should have stopped right before that sentence because that is none of your business, it\u2019s not what she asked about so it wasn\u2019t needed.", "I think, that\u2019s the same as asking, who would my husband be reunited with if the afterlife is real? \n\nI don\u2019t play games with my own head. Right now, right here, what matters is my husband\u2019s love for me. I cherish it everyday. \n\nHave a great rest of the week.", ">there was no termination of the relationship.\n\nShe died. That terminated it. No, she isn't still his mil. And he definitely doesn't have to live his life according to her wishes or give any kind of explanation to her", "Umm.. that would imply the late wife is still his wife. Which isn\u2019t true at all. Marriage means \u201ctill death do us part\u201d - his only obligation to the promises he made to her were until the time she passed. There is virtually no other marital commitment now until I became his wife. \n\nI didn\u2019t marry an already married man. He doesn\u2019t have two wives. So he doesn\u2019t have two sets of in laws. I am his wife, so his only in laws now are my parents.", "You don\u2019t know anything about our relationship. Or him. I have no incentive to lie here. \n\nJust because I happen to have an actual relationship with someone who\u2019s widowed doesn\u2019t mean you have to get mean about it. Because I\u2018ve met your kind too \n\nStop projecting", "Don't listen to this guy, op. That's your house now and neither of you owe that lady an explanation. Maybe now she'll get the gist that she should butt out of your lives  and you won't have to put up with her ass anymore", "So he should cut off her family completely and ignore the relationship he had with them as soon as she died? which is what I think you actually want and would likely happen gradually/naturally.  If your husband dies will you no longer have a relationship with his parents?\n\nI don't think you're the ah for redecorating at all. Him giving her a heads up things have changed in the house would have been nice so it wasn't a complete blindside and I think she reacted emotionally, another reminder that her daughter is no longer alive and life is moving on.\n\nBut your comments make you appear quite aggressive and not as compassionate as the way you've worded your post.\n\nIt sounds like If he had kids you would expect their memory of their mum to be confined to their room and there should be no evidence of her elsewhere in the home because it's yours now not the home they had with their mum. I know that's hypothetical but the impression I get.  \n\nDoes your husband visit her grave? Honour her on her birthday? How do you feel if  he does? A bit jealous I mean she was his greatest love first because he married her first, if she hadn't died you wouldn't be his wife now.\n\nI don't think you're as ok with being the second wife as you make out.", "I'm impressed by how well I called it.  You fooled a lot of people on Reddit. \n\nGood luck with your husband", "If I actually believed in cutting off a former in law, I wouldn\u2019t have invited her at all. Let\u2019s get this straight. I appreciate their friendship and bond that they have, but not as my husband\u2019s in-laws. Because his actual in-laws are my parents, as he is MY husband. I don\u2019t share that, never will, and I don\u2019t think anybody should have to. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t visit her grave, or celebrate her birthdays or any day really. It\u2019s just any other normal day for us. I am not jealous that she had him first, because I have him now and that\u2019s all that matters.\n\nWe have a happy married life primarily because we focus on OUR relationship and what makes us happy as a couple. He tells me daily he loves me and I am his greatest love and I tell him the same. Marriage is a wonderful thing \ud83d\udc95", "Who hurt you?", "If your husband didn't care about the pictures, he would have burned or thrown them away.  He wouldn't have put them in a box inside storage.  \n\nYou can stop pretending.", "Much of her stuff has been donated/given to her brother. Only a few things are left in storage. We just didn\u2019t know what to do with them so we put them away.", "Seriously man, who hurt you?", "Lmao you sound delusional"]}
