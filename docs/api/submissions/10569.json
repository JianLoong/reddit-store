He said since grandpa was always the one driving, he would talk to them from the passenger side and tell his sob story and ask if they could spare a few dollars. He said it was important to be on the passenger side because the old man wouldn't be able to say no while being able to see his wife's reaction. They don't want to look callous to a struggling young family in front of their wife and would usually hand over $10-20. \n\nThey made enough from panhandling that they didn't need other jobs.
