Gertrude is allergic to glutens so cooking for her has always been a bit of a challenge.\n\nI really didn\u2019t want to have a dinner party on a Wednesday because I am the gourmet cook in the household and people expect me to make gourmet food for them. I work late that day so the time I start cooking dinner, I am already exhausted.\n\nBut Mark and Gertrude insisted on coming ASAP. Because Gertrude is unemployed while Mark was recently laid off. I offered to refer him to my current employer who is hiring for multiple positions and Mark wants to see what\u2019s available.\n\nSo I ended my WfH day at 3:30 and began slow cooking oxtail stew. I mix my own source using fresh ingredients and a little bit of miso. For some reason - most probably tiredness - kept thinking miso is gluten free because it\u2019s made of soy, not wheat or corn.\n\nMy partner \u201cCasper\u201d offered me to help me do some cooking and when he saw the miso, told me that miso can have trace gluten in it and we can\u2019t serve the oxtail. By the time dinner had been stewing for over 1.5hrs and there was not enough time to make anything else. So we ordered sushi takeaway instead.\n\nWhen Gertrude and Mark arrived she was excited to smell the oxtail cooking on the stove, because that was her favourite. I apologised and explained the situation and offered sushi instead. Gertrude was quiet the whole evening and starred daggers at me.\n\nIt got worse because Casper and Mark are both socially inept and dug into the oxtail stew while commenting on how delicious it was. At that moment I really wanted to dig a hole in the ground and disappear.\n\nLater today I saw that Gertrude had made a passive-aggressive social media post calling me TA without actually naming me. Her words were something along the lines of \u201csome stupid asshole thought it was a good idea to add miso in a dish that never required miso for thousands of years just to feel smart. And now my dinner was ruined. SMH.\u201d\n\nThe comments were agreeing with her and there are other allergic people calling me an ignorant asshole. And I just feel really bad. I tried to do two nice things for Mark and ended up being called TA.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1696521750, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/170lpb2/aita_for_making_dinner_for_a_friend_with_allergy/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You made an error so ordered take out sushi and instead of saying thank you she posts on social media about it. Wow. I can't fathom the rudeness. \n\nNTA", "Of course you're NTA. You didn't know miso had gluten. Gertrude really overreacted. I don't know why she \"stared daggers\" at you. You provided something else to eat. I'm sure it's not the first time she's been at a meal while others ate something she couldn't have.\n\nAnd to shame you about it on social media was disgraceful. She needs to get over herself.\n\nThey don't sound like good friends either, \"insisting\" they come over early. Don't they understand the meaning of the word \"No\"? I'd have been tempted to tell them if they came early I wouldn't open the door.", "\"I spent hours cooking dinner for a couple of guests mid-week after a long day, because one of them wanted to come over so I could do them a favor. In my exhaustion, I made a mistake and included an ingredient one of them was allergic to. I immediately ordered food in, as there was no time to cook something else from scratch, and felt awful because all that effort had been wasted.\n\nThen, the guest decided I had been an asshole to her for my honest mistake, and bitches about it on social media, calling me names. I don't think I'll be cooking for her again.\"", "So let me summarize and see if I have this straight. A couple of unemployed moochers invited themselves to your house for dinner on a weeknight.

Instead of accepting what happened as a mistake, she chose to roast you on social media.  Not a mature or nice person.\n\nI personally would never, ever, invite them to dinner again.\n\nLet your partner meet Mark for coffee or lunch if they want to catch up or network.\n\nHugs and Good Luck", "NTA. That would be the last time she was able to cross over my threshold, much less eat my food.", "NTA. Your unemployed friends \"insisted on coming ASAP\" for dinner, used an ingredient that is usually gluten-free (not all miso labels have the ingredients in a language other than Japanese), you provided a reasonable substitute for the guest, and she sniped at you online. Please tell me she didn't use soy sauce with her sushi!", "What did the label on the miso say? I am gluten-intolerant: the white miso paste I buy does not list any gluten allergens, and has never caused me any problems.\n\nLooking it up, I see that miso paste made with fermented soy and rice is gluten-free (like mine), while some kinds may have some fermented wheat or barley and are not gluten-free.", "She got Sushi and she complained about a ruined dinner?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople should be so lucky\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  Also not all miso has gluten.  So you weren't even necessarily wrong in the first place.", "\" some stupid asshole...And now my dinner was ruined.\"\n\nWow.  The entitlement.  You understand  that you no longer have to invite Gerturde over  anymore, right?  \"Thems fighing words.\" Buggs  Bunny\n\nYou made a mistake.  NTA don't cook for her again.", "NTA, but please never cook for Mark and Gertrude again. Sit Casper down, show him this post and Gertrude\u2019s post and explain how exhausting it is to go out of your way only to be bashed online for a small mistake. \n\nYou cook when you feel like it- not when someone forces you into a corner by coming over \u201cASAP\u201d. Gertrude can kick rocks.", "NTA. \n\nFirst, ignore the posts on her social media, because they don't know the story and how she wrote it makes it seem like SHE made the meal and someone added to it. So their opinions really don't matter. \n\nSecond, you made a mistake and more importantly, corrected it by not serving food that would hurt a guest AND by having alternate food available. \n\nFinally, do not have these people over again. You can take two approaches to this. The first is to simply decline to host them and not invite them over. Share with your partner the social media post and that you don't want to cook for them again, and if he every wants to have them over, he can be in charge of hosting. The second is to text/call these two \"friends\" and tell them that you saw the social media post, it is very hurtful given you made an honest mistake, no one was harmed, and everyone was fed, and that you will not be inviting them over again. Both approaches are fine, I'd do the latter but if you don't want confrontation, simply not having them over again is fine. \n\nAnd don't be pressured in to hosting, ever. Just because people can't feed themselves doesn't meant they can put the work on you.", "Oh my, SOOOO NTA. Gertrude was frankly insanely rude, not to mention the disgustingness of being PA towards you as a completely gracious host. \n\nSome of this - a tiny amount - seemed to stem from you taking on too much and hopefully in the future you're able to guard against that more. But that does NOT make you TA. I'm sorry she was so insulting and hurtful. You aren't a GF eater, and it's more than reasonable for you to lack total awareness of ingredients that may have trace amounts. I would really be questioning Gertrude's friendship and sure as hell would not host her again, and would not take responsibility for making her food. If you stay friends, you should hold a firm line to never be responsible for her food, and I'd probably be a bit passive aggressive like \"Sorry Gertrude, I just can't risk putting you in danger with any of my cooking so this meal is not intended for you.\"", "NTA.  Gertrude sounds like an awful human being.  You tried doing something nice for them and made a mistake.  I also never would have thought miso had gluten in it.  Also, they invited themselves over to your house for dinner expecting some gourmet meal likely because they're struggling financially right now and didn't want to pay to go out.  I would seriously hesitate to ever spend time with her again.  The fact that you're even questioning how big of an asshole move that is for her to make is kind of ridiculous.", "Good lord, NTA - what an ungrateful drama queen. You made a MISTAKE, admitted it, and provided a perfectly good backup. She's ridiculous.", "NTA. You made an honest mistake and tried to rectify within the time limits you had available. Gertrude's post is ... unbelievable. HER dinner was ruined? Why are you calling them your friends again?", "NTA. Having a family member who suffers with celiac disease, I know how difficult it is to make sure foods and other substances don't contain gluten. You were trying to be a gracious host to a couple who, in your own words, imposed themselves on you at an inconvenient time for which you had to rearrange your working day. As far as using miso, I often use miso or tamari to add a savory flavor to sauces. Just don't invite Gertrude anymore.", "NTA Gertrude has been very rude. It was an honest mistake and you gracefully provided her with an alternative. She seems entitled. Urging you to cook on a busy day and than complaining because she didn\u2019t get to eat what she prefers.", "Wow. Gertrude is a prize jerk. Do not invite her again. NTA.", "You\u2019re nta and these people are not your friends. They\u2019re users and rude. Cut off contact and move on. No loss for you.", "Nta but you need to learn to stand up for yourself a lot more- invite people when it\u2019s convenient, not when they want to come and order something easy if it\u2019s a weeknight - start drawing some boundaries and saying no", "NTA\n\nI'm a coeliac so I also can't eat gluten. If someone told me \"I'm sorry I made a mistake and mixed something not gf in, but please have x to eat instead\" I'd be happy they are careful and provide for me. Actually stuff like this happened before. Never have I made someone feel bad for accidents like this.", "NTA I insist you don\u2019t cook for them anymore", "NTA. Gertrude needs to learn some manners. There was nothing socially inept about Mark and Casper eating the stew, it was there to be eaten. You made a simple mistake-it wasn't out of ignorance or made deliberately, it was just a simple mistake and you offered an alternative. It's not your fault Gertrude is a graceless, vengeful moron. Personally, she'd never be invited back to my house again unless she offered a genuine apology for her behaviour.", "NTA, found a problem before it became a health issue. Gertrude on the other hand is unhinged, saying \"her dinner was ruined\". I hope you never cook for them again.", "NTA. Your \"friend\" is being an ungrateful AH. People make mistakes and once you realized you made a mistake you did your best to come up with an alternative. She can make her own stew next time.", "Nta,\n\nThese people sound unbearable. Also, pretty sure soy miso is gluten free. But that\u2019s besides the point. Moochers who basically invited themselves get upset by an honest mistake. Goodness people are losing it", ">people expect me to make gourmet food for them  \n>  \n>Mark and Gertrude insisted on coming ASAP.\n\nYou're not a restaurant\n\n>Gertrude was quiet the whole evening and starred daggers at me.\n\nchoosy beggar\n\n>Gertrude had made a passive-aggressive social media post calling me TA\n\nPut some distance between you and the Gertrude-Mark duo\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA to yourself, grow a spine and start putting boundaries and limits with these \"friends\"", "NTA, you didn't want her to get an allergic reaction and suffer, so you told her not to eat. Y'all ordered takeout anyways. Like why is she being so pissy about freakin dinner?", "NTA. That would be if you had thought \"oh well, a little bit of gluten won't hurt\" and served it anyway.", "You need better friends. NTA.  I have celiac and I can't have gluten.  You fed her, that's all you are obligated to do...that and end this \"friendship.\"", "NTA Wow your friends sound incredibly entitled and rude.\nYou made a mistake, unintentionally. And admitted to it\n\nPeople with food allergies should know how difficult it is to live with such restrictions and having to check every single label before buying and cooking\n \nSo for a person (especially one who loves to cook and doesn't have such allergy) it's hard to change the mindset and mistakes can happen .. \n\nYou told her about it, and instead of saying thank you for telling me and for making an effort to cook especially for her she stared daggers at you and then blew up on you on social media\n\nTell her, make your  own damn food \n\n\n I wouldn't be friends with them\nThey didn't even appreciate  the effort you made", "Honestly if someone is going to act like a spoiled brat when you fed them out of your pocket then fuck them. NTA.", "NTA - it was an honest mistake and you told her about it", "NTA as someone who has a severe gluten allergy I always offer to bring my own food or make adaptions myself to make the life of others easier. Gluten allergy is exceptionally hard to cater to and you can\u2019t expect other people to be aware of everything that contains gluten. I did want to point out that most sushi also contains gluten, at least where I\u2019m from.", "NTA. \n\nThese people are not your friends.", "You are NTA, you made a mistake and corrected it before dinner. Gertrude is rude, ungrateful and a b. I'd never cook for them again and definitely not refer either of them for a job where you work. That won't end well for you.", "NTA for a simple and easy mistake. You also made steps towards a solution.

You made dinner not knowing miso had gluten in it (I didn\u2019t know until your post). Then you came up with an alternative meal once you found out. \n\nHonestly, not only are you NTA, but they are A for being such rude guests. I would reconsider referring them to your manager. I\u2019ve referred many people over the years and you should not do it if there is going to be potential drama.", "I think you need new friends !", "NTA but don't have them over for dinner again.

She is.", "NTA\n\nI would not welcome anyone who shits on me over social media.\nmuch less cook for them!! \n\n\nonly suggestion for you for next time is to show the offending ingredient to the guest and ask their opinion. if they risk it its on them.", "NTA. It's an illustration of what good manners and social intelligence are good for. The others could have helped to defuse the disappointment. Yeah, it sucks, but people make mistakes, and yours was caught, and you provided food she could eat.", "NTA\n\nYou made a mistake and corrected it.\n\nBut 35 and 60? What's up with that?!", "INFO:  did it say 'contains gluten' or 'may contain traces of gluten' because if it's the latter she should have been ok provided she doesn't have a serious allergy.  My son is allergic to gluten but can eat miso pastes ok if it's not an actual ingredient.  There wouldn't have been much if it was just a spoonful of miso.  \nBut either way NTA, you provided an alternative meal for her.", "NTA honest mistake and it's not like she starved while there. posting on social media is super immature", "NTA but don't invite them over again", "NTA. There's a reason you're good at what you do. It's because you try new ingredients and combinations to see what might make something more palatable. Yours was an honest enough mistake, and I'm sorry, but anyone that insists you cook for them is a jerk.", "NTA but I would be petty and just not cook for her anymore.", "NTA. You owned up to an apparent error and provided alternative food for her . This was very thoughtful of you.  Miso sometimes is gf so you just needed to check the label btw. I'm severely gluten intolerant and use it sometimes, it does give a nice umami.\nAnyway NTA, she is for posting about it and not  appreciating your efforts", "Oh dear god your so NTA. Do not let this women be part of your life and please stick up for yourself in this matter. You cooked dinner, yes mistake with the miso but you made the effort to gave this couple over for dinner. Then rectified it by ordering sushi. Say you\u2019d decided to order sushi from the start she would have no reason to complain. This women is entitled and ungrateful. Don\u2019t need that kind of person in your life. Especially with the Facebook post. What an unkind person to have over to your home. I\u2019d say put a post up yourself to explain you had an ungrateful guest over who you bought sushi for due to a meal mishap. And they were entitled enough to complain. But y know what there\u2019s no point retaliating. Just make sure people know the actual situation.", "TIL miso isn't gluten free.

She was a guest for dinner and therefore what you served is what she gets.  You talk about the entitled mentality... that's Gertie.  Honestly I am very gluten sensitive and I do avoid it.  If someone serves something I cannot eat... I don't eat it, no big deal.  Tell her next time bring a dish she knows she can eat... problem solved.", "oh ffs", "ESH. If you promise someone who's allergic to cook for them then you have a responsibility to check that you're not using ingredients they are allergic to. You screwed up, but seemingly not out of ill will.\n\nBut once you realized you'd screwed up you tried to fix it. And then literally everyone else behaved like complete shit.", "ESH, Everyone Sucks Here.\n\nShe shouldn't have taken her complaints to social media.\n\nBut you shouldn't have served *anyone* the stew.  You realized before anyone got there it was a problem for one guest and ordered takeout for the gathering. That should have been given to all. \n\nYou chose not to do that, to \"show off\" your gourmet stew. You should have saved your stew for dinner tomorrow with your own household, instead of creating a situation where some guests are getting special treatment.", "YTA. If you know someone has an allergy, you read the labels on everything you use while cooking.", "I'm not going to call you an asshole but you're the one who decided to have a dinner party. You're the one who knew one of the 2 people you invited has a gluten allergy.  Then you're the one who didn't check the ingredients before cooking.  \n\nYou're not an asshole but this is your fault 100%.

Good thing you never have to cook for her again!  She is completely wrong here.", "NTA\n\nSimple solution.  Don't cook for her anymore.  Simply call her out in the comments.  Tell her that if she thinks you're such an idiot with your cooking, you're happy to never cook for her again.  Then either block her or ignore her.

C'mon she's not 3yo\ud83e\udee3 \n\nYou don't write about it, but it also depends on whether she eats gluten-free because she has to, because she is sick or because of her beliefs.

If it is because of her beliefs then it is her own decision, she could have tried it if she really wanted.", "Also, a lot of sushi is prepared either with or certainly around gluten such as soy sauce, if she's that severely allergic she could just have easily reacted to the sushi as the white miso.

Fuck that ungrateful AH. \n\nYou didn\u2019t HAVE to cook for them, you simply made a small mistake and then ordered food so there would still be something she could eat.

You made a mistake.  Bigger mistake would be to be a reference for her husband when he applies.  Call and tell him so and why.  For her to trash you like that.  You did not serve it to her.  You went out of your way to get food she could eat.", "ESH here. You always check ingredients when you are dealing with a guest who has allergies. Hell, I have things that I know have been cross contaminated so if I am making something for a celiac I will buy all new ingredients so I can be 100% certain that I\u2019ve done my due diligence. That said, she was a bit rude with how she reacted to the situation.", "NTA - and lose these friends!  They are WAY too old to act like this and they expect a job favor on top?  Please find it within yourself to stand up to her and say \"I'm sorry for the mistake, but I do not like the way you are treating me.\"  Then no more dinners OR job recommendations.  Her behavior is really awful and you do not have to put up with it.", "NTA. You forgot about it, as you said. And it isn't a big mistake that cost anyone their health.

Like, say it directly if you're so angry.", "NTA\n\nEspecially considering that they invited themselves in way and let you deal with it.", "Because Gertie liked a good oxtail soup and hers didn't have miso as an ingredient.  Well then, Ms Gertie should have brought something, then.  Her attitude towards OP is unbelievably entitled.  She not only expected a good meal, but prepared the way she cooks.  Well I guess Ms. Gertie should have cooked the meal.  It would be the last time she broke bread in my home.", "Thanks.

I have yet to find a brand of soy sauce that does not have a cross contamination warning.", "I just checked the miso soup I had at work just to be sure I hadn\u2019t overlooked it when I bought it. It\u2019s also gluten free.", "I got white miso too. Pretty sure no miso ever contains gluten. There was a warning on the label that said the white miso I got was made with machinery that also made gluten products and trace amounts of gluten could have gotten into it.", "Even the ones that are not made from wheat still may contain traces of gluten due to cross contamination. And for a celicac or allergic it may be enough to trigger a reaction.", "Apparently when the package was read it said, \"may contain trace amounts\" it was a cross contamination issue. But, unless someone needs to know that they won't have any clue. I didn't think about miso having gluten. \n\nBut I always ask the ingredients if desserts because I'm allergic to peppers and people will throw them into just about anything! I had some pumpkin pie that had cayenne in it. Never made that mistake again. But if you ask someone without my allergy they'd assume a pumpkin pie would be safe because most of the time it would be. I also don't eat anything that just lists \"spices\" because that could be safe or it could kill me.", "Guaranteed Gertrude will never eat there again as she won't want to get ill.", "Boundaries are literally the most important thing ever and learning that it's ok to set them seems to be the hardest lesson some people never learn", "Sometimes it isn\u2019t. With celiac you really just have to read the label for everything to make sure.", "Haha yeah that amused me too. OP is NTA, but \u201csorry this food actually contains gluten, do you want to eat something else that almost definitely contains gluten?\u201d kinda cracked me up. I\u2019ve only seen GF sushi in one restaurant in my entire life (but if OP knew for sure that was also definitely safe that makes them even more NTA)!\n\nRegardless, her entitlement sucks.

In OP's places, I would have said exactly that to Gertrude and allowed her to decide for herself whether to risk it.", "Miso itself *should* be gluten free. There's nothing about it that *requires* a gluten-containing ingredient. In OP's case, the miso used was processed on machinery that also processed foods that contained gluten, so the issue was cross-contamination. *Some* types of miso *can* include wheat or barley, but only *some*. In my experience (as someone on a gluten-free diet), miso is generally pretty safe, but as with all things, double-checking a specific product is always a good idea.", "mmm calling her an ahole for a mistake seems a bit much- she was a teeny bit irresponsible, yes, but an honest mistake she apologized her exempts her from the Ahole title, yes?", "Um... she ain't promise shit.

Obviously, there is the option of saving it to eat for later, yes, but she made the food for this gathering. She put time and effort into it.

Maybe she would've had time to formulate something else to cook? She quite literally admits she made a mistake, and that she apologized to gertrude for it, and paid for other food for her to eat.

How exactly is not eating one dish.... ruining dinner?", "You can\u2019t be serious. \n\nIt was a honest mistake, and the \u201cguests\u201d self-invited themselves over.
