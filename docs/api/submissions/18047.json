I had no idea. But apparently it's an open secret in my family - I'm 39M. Apparently everyone knows - including my 26F cousin. We were close, she was like a younger sister to me. \n\nThe argument was basically about a tv program and one of the main characters decided to raise a kid that isn't his biologically - I said I'd never do that. My cousin took exception to that as she's recently had a child and also doesn't have a relationship with her bio dad. So she felt affronted when I said it thinking I knew about my dad. I didn't. It got heated, I told her to fuck off and haven't spoken to her since. To say I am devastated is an understatement. \n\nShe's tried to call me and apologise - I told her in no uncertain terms I don't accept and to fuck off. Then her fianc\u00e9e tried to call me and get me to calm down. I didn't have any of it. \n\nMy parents are trying to get me to reconsider as she didn't know and are saying i reacted poorly. I told them they're the course of the problem and to also fuck off. Edited to add I called my dad a cuck which didn't go down well. \n\nAITA for refusing the apology and the way I reacted?\n\nEdited to add please stop suggesting therapy. ITS NOT GOING TO CHANGE MY DNA!\n\nUPDATE. She just came around banging on my door to talk. Made a real scene. I threatened to ring the police if she didn't go. Now all my neighbours know something's up. Fuck me.\n\nUPDATE 2 Fuck it, I'm on the rum and coke at 10:54AM.

Yes, your parents should have told you at some point in the past 39 years. You shouldn't have to hear it from a younger cousin, of all people. But also remember that they raised you, and I presume you have a decent enough upbringing from them. That doesn't change with the fact that you are not your dad's biological son. The only thing that does change with the fact that you found out you don't share DNA with your dad is your medical record, that's it.\n\nAnd of course you can tell your child that their grandfather doesn't share DNA with them either. But solely so they know the truth. Are they still your child's grandfather? Very much so, if your dad has been as much a good granddad to them as he is a good father to you. Being a father and grandfather also constitutes how they raised you, cared for you, supported you and be there for you all the way through, not just about blood.\n\nIf you need to, take time away from your family. Really process the whole new information with a calm and rational mind. It won't do making decisions while you are still angry", "Yta it's not her fault your parents have kept a secret from you although it seems every other person knows.", "ESH except your cousin. To each their own I guess re raising a child not blood-related. But she thought it was odd because you are the result of that experience, which she thought you knew. You should have been told long ago, but don't get mad at her about it. \n\nApparently you are not cutting off contact with your parents who failed to inform you for 39 years, but you're going to stay upset and blame your 26yo cousin for this situation? That's absolutely an overreaction on your part and she even apologized for the heated argument. I'm with her fianc\u00e9e.", "YTA and so are your parents for not telling you. But hey, thank god your father was willing to raise someone who wasn't his bio kid, even if he failed to teach you the same good morals. The only one that isn't an AH here is your cousin. Get over it.", "YTA - your situation sucks and I feel for you, but your cousin didn't know you didn't know. Don't take it out on her.\n\nIf you want to be angry at someone, be angry at the parents who never told you. But remember they love you and raised you, regardless of blood. \n\nAlso, side note, if you couldn't love a child because it's not made out of your own stuff, you're probably not going to be a great parent.", "YTA- you\u2019re mad because you really thought you were in the right arguing with her not knowing that something you\u2019d never do was what you where living because someone else had kindness and now you are forced to think about yourself is what it seems like.", "NTA your parent\u2019s willingness to have that information out there without telling you is horrible \n\nYour dad is your dad. Your sperm donor is\nYour father.  I understand the hurt and betrayal\n\nDecided what you want when your calmer", "YTA. Your cousin is not the problem here. She didn't know you didn't know. And in fact, you SHOULD know. So she kind of did you a favour.", "NTA. It's hard to accept an apology when you're feeling so hurt. Your parents have been very negligent and when you feel ready, they need to do a lot of explaining. Your cousin made a mistake, harmful as it was, the hurt she has caused wasn't intended. It's unreasonable of her or anyone else to expect you to so quickly put it all aside and accept apologies. You have a lot to process. This kind of shock makes you question your whole identity. If I were you, I would tell those who are pestering you to accept the apologies, that you need some time to process what has happened and that that is your focus for now. Ask them to give you some space. When you have had thinking time, and have spoken with your parents, you'll be more able to see where your anger needs to be directed.", "It depends on how it went. \n\nIf she said it to piss you off or insult you, then NTA. \n\nIf she said it to confront you on what your thoughts are on the issue, but without it being insulting, the YTA. I understand that it must be a shock, but she didn't know you didn't know. \n\nBut you know who's the true assholes? Your parents. It's insane that the whole family knew except you. I'd have a huge fight with them.\n\nTake care, it must be a very hard thing to face", "YTA. She didn\u2019t know that you didn\u2019t know about your father, so she isn\u2019t to blame. I completely understand why she felt attacked. She also apologized for what she said.\n\nYour parents are also AHs as they should have told you this long ago.\n\nYou should make amends with your cousin and have a serious conversation with your parents as to why they hid this. You would have gone your entire life not knowing this if it weren\u2019t for your cousin. \n\nI think you\u2019re just mad that everyone knew but you and you\u2019re taking it out on your cousin who had no idea.", "NAH, well, not between you and your cousin. She genuinely didn't know. And everone needs to understand that for you this came out of nowhere. \n\nYour parents are MASSIVE AH's and any of your family who knew you were adopted and kept the secret knowingly and willingly are too. Massive betrayal. \n\nI am sorry this is happening to you OP. Ask your cousin for processing time. No need to talk this out instantly. \n\nYour cousin does sound empathetic and kind though, you might want to reconnect with this non-AH in the future. Apparently they're scarce in your family.", "NAH\n\nThis sucks but she thought you knew.\n\nThe assholes are all the relatives who never told you\n\nYou were assholey but you were in shock. When the shock wears off please make up with your cousin", "YTA because it\u2019s not your cousin\u2019s fault. Also for the cuck comment.\n\nYour parents take the AH crown for seemingly telling everyone BUT you. Your cousin was born 13 years after you and knows something about your birth that you don\u2019t - that\u2019s all on them. I\u2019d be livid.\n\nTo be clear, you\u2019re not the AH for your initial reaction. But not accepting the apology when she didn\u2019t know you didn\u2019t know? Yeah. That\u2019s an AH move.", "ESH except for your cousin. Your parents should have told you and also it seems that they have failed with your upbringing. You are lashing out to your cousin for telling the truth and speaking horribly to your parents.", "ESH except OP. The entire family knew for thirty-nine years and not a single one told you. Not one, not even your parents. Thirty-nine years of whispers and knowing looks, and gossip behind your back. Your family is awful, OP. I am so sorry.  I hope that you hook yourself up with a therapist because you're going to need it. Best of luck.", "ESH. It\u2019s not your cousin\u2019s fault your parents didn\u2019t tell you. She clearly thought you already knew so it\u2019s not like she was trying to throw it in your face so much as call out what she perceived to be hypocrisy. \n\nThey should understand you need space to process and you have a right to be upset but don\u2019t confuse that as having the right to be an ass.", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
