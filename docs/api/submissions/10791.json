You're not going to enjoy having to \"parent\" her, and she's going to resent being told what to do.", "She literally did the exact thing you carefully warned her about, and has now flipped the script to blame you for over-explaining the danger to her? And she now expects you to compensate her for her poor decision?\nNTA but your GF is quite the manipulative one. Don't buy her that laptop, and consider an upgrade for yourself...of the GF.", "NTA. You specifically told her she needed to have the money in her account.  She needs to take full responsibility for her part in getting scammed, even if you did talk down to her that is no excuse for sending the product without payment.  \n\nThis is also very concerning that she does not take responsibility for her own mistakes and blames you instead, be careful if you are thinking long term.", "NTA. You explained the dangers and set the terms of what was required for you to pay the difference between the two laptops. She decided to do it her way, was scammed and now she's blaming you. \ud83d\ude44 \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA, it's not talking down to her if she literally does not know how it works. The exact reason you told her what to do is how she got scammed. Not sure how that is your fault at all.", "You weren\u2019t talking down to her. You were giving her solid advice on online sales and how to avoid scams. But she thought she knew better and disregarded common sense and therefore she got scammed. How is that your fault? She should be angry at herself for not following basic internet sales precautions. That was a foolish thing to do. She shouldn\u2019t expect you to pay for her stupidity.", "NTA, she did exactly what you warned her not to do. She\u2019s entirely to blame. Sadly no MacBook Pro but a cheaper laptop to the value of $600. Take or leave it.", "NTA - the only thing you need to get her is a one way ticket out of your life", "NTA\n\nYou warned her and given the fact that she still sent the macbook without receiving the money first she has proven that she doesn\u2018t know enough about scammers and internet safety. So your warning was legit.\n\nWe call it \u201eeducation fee\u201c when someone loses a lot of money or a great opportunity because they didn\u2018t listen and acted recklessly. \n\nNow she\u2018s gotta pay for it aka save up on her own.", "NTA. You made her aware of the risks and advised her to protect herself. She chose to take the stupid route and losing her laptop was the natural consequence of that. \n\nGive her nothing - don't reward her behaviour.", "NTA.\nAnd I don\u2019t even think you need to by her a cheaper laptop! The agreement was clear and precise!\nNow\u2026 is this the kind of person you want to be with ? Careless, throwing tantrums, can\u2019t carry over a simple arrangement\u2026etc.", "NTA.  How about you not paying at all?  And possibly not dating this gf?", "NTA. Not only were you just explaining how scams work, but you were right. Something she'd know if she'd done a minimal amount of research.  I think you're being generous paying for it at all. She sounds very immature.", "NTA\nYou obviously knew she was a bit simple and would be easily fooled that\u2019s why you warned her. You were right, she should have listened to you.", "NTA. There's some universal karmic force that needed to reach her a lesson. Also, sit her down and seriously ask her why *you* need to buy her a new Macbook.", "So, if you tell her about the dangers of driving too fast in bad weather, is she going to get into an accident and blame you for it?\n\nNTA", "NTA. She went and did exactly what you told her not to do.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
