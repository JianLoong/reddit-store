Let's start with your feelings. I understand how you feel and it's valid for you to feel that way. Know that it's perfectly normal to have feelings, and they're meant to be understood, not rejected or disregarded, or worse, ridiculed.\n\nThat said, when and if you expressed your feelings as you mentioned here, using \"I\" statements, and your GFs reaction is \"you're insecure, deal with it, I want to remember my amazing ex\", well... Those are some very telling reactions. Does that speak about care, respect and love?\n\nFrom what I can understand by the way you wrote it down, she cares very little about how you feel, seems to be enamourated with her ex, and emotionally abuses you through comments saying you're insecure and you have to deal with it.\n\nI would not move in with someone that shows this little regard to my emotions.\n\nI would advise to evaluate your self respect and re-evaluate the relationship. Ask yourself hard questions. Does she want to move in because she loves you, or is there something else she gets out of it? Do her actions and words make you feel loved? Do you feel emotionally safe to express your emotions? Do you feel validated and understood?", "NTA. This is some red flag behaviour. The fact she got annoyed at you too instead of calmly explaining her reasoning is another red flag. \n\nDamn bro it ain't looking great for you, sorry", "Info: if she's just saving it for the future why can't it get put up somewhere out of sight?", "Don\u2019t sign that lease bro she ain\u2019t the one for you", "NTA.

People don't keep pics of their exes if they're over them - unless something tragic happened to them. I think the only tragedy is the ex's behaviour. It makes you feel uncomfortable and insecure.

Someone that's over their ex doesn't get defensive about and come up with a worthless excuse to keep a picture of their *ex* lmao. As soon as he said that they started dating quickly after her last relationship, I knew it was gonna be a sad post. \n\nOP, your gf is still dating her ex in her mind. They both think this way. You think this guy stalks and harasses you for fun? Nope, he's being honest. He wants his gf to stop playing house with you so they can continue.
