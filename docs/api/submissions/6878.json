I was on and off again in contact with her for the last two decades.\nI realized that I always felt unheard, criticized and bad about myself after I talked to her or saw her. I always felt sad also and it manifested itself in anger. This is what I focused on in therapy and I decided that I no longer wanted to feel that way and that my mom would never change. I haven\u2019t seen her in almost two years and she hasn\u2019t even met my youngest kid. The holidays were hard but I owe it to myself to protect my energy and my mental well being.\n\nStart to take note of how you feel when she is around and even after.

From experience that\u2019s really hard I\u2019m amazed you were able to do it so young. That move with the arm was smart she wanted to quietly abuse you because she knew it was wrong and you put it on full display. As for the people on the trip I\u2019m sure it was a \u201chm that was weird\u201d and never thought of it again situation so I wouldn\u2019t call you an AH on their account, you weren\u2019t to your mother either not shying down to abuse doesn\u2019t make you an AH, just strong. I\u2019d seriously reconsider NC if I were you, that guilt you feel is her years of abuse and manipulation working on you. She never cared to make you feel safe, loved unconditionally, or show you what a true mother is - so why do you feel you owe her anything? (Besides her demanding it?) and for the record her damning it isn\u2019t enough. So clearing it up you\u2019re NTA to your mom, to those strangers, or anyone else. Your mom is a AH of gigantic unheard of proportions and you need to really work on undoing her spell on you.
