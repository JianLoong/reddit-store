This is the tip of the iceberg - it's something that looks small on the surface, but when you dig down you start to realise it's not a small thing at all but something really fundamental to the foundation of your marriage.

Play, like pranking and joking, is a mutual experience, and if everyone isn't enjoying it, it needs to stop or change. Otherwise it becomes bullying.\n\nYou've tried to play along, you've tried to tone it down, you've tried to address it politely. You've done all the right things.\n\nNothing has worked to shift their focus on commenting on your clothes. There's a point at which that becomes deliberate and undeniably mean-spirited, and I think after three years and you becoming steadily more uncomfortable, that point has passed. Evidence for that is the fact that now they've pushed you out of the family gatherings, they haven't expressed any concern for you; they've just changed target to comment on your fitness to be a father. That's not playful.\n\nAnd in the middle of all of that...your wife does not have your back.

Some families tease each other all the time because they find it's fun to trade harmless barbs back and forth. Some tease to make people feel at home (as in, \"you're one of the family and we won't spare you!\"). I also suspect extended families are more likely to tease because they are trying to make up for familiarity they might be lacking, plus it's more fun than making small talk about the weather.\n\nThis just doesn't seem like a big deal. I'd just grin and play along because it seems extraordinarily normal to me. It might be a lot more upsetting if they treated you super formally and left you out of the teasing that I presume they spread around to everyone during the holidays.", "FUCK HER...its not OK to be that dismissive of your feelings are they showed its more than your clothes that they don't like about you..is she that dismissive of your feelings on other topics?", "\nIDK man, based on the fact that you refuses to answer what exactly it is that you\u2019re wearing to these events, I only infer that you are underdressed.

A black blazer over a decent emo tee works fine.  One can have a darker pair of jeans with no rips and minimal trip hardware on it.  There are lots of boots and sneakers that ride the line between casual and flashy.\n\nSome emo jewelry may actually look nice, like one necklace and one nice earring.   Multiple bracelets can be worn if they don't look like they are made from junkyard leftovers. \n\nI honestly get the idea the family is a bit conservative and OP refuses to meet his wife halfway.  \n\nI wish OP would go next year with a custom shirt depicting his in laws in comic form, under a nice, unlined blazer or light, high-quality, long-sleeved button down.\n\nThey tease him about his clothes, and he can open his blazer or shirt and say, \"Yeah, this group is definitely out there.\"", "But if his wife is telling him that they\u2019re just playful jokes then surely he\u2019s not that dressed down.\n\nIf it was a black tie event and he\u2019s wearing jeans and a t-shirt I\u2019d expect his wife to have more of an opinion on the matter.", "Yeah.

OP's age is not given, but since they've been together some years and are trying for a child I'm going to guess it might be early 30s.

Is he going to show up looking like that to parent-teacher nights? Or stick it to the establishment and just...not go to stuff? These are completely valid things for them to wonder.", "Might be but it also might be the polite rock/hard place response. Like if he does dress more casually for the event than everyone else, she might agree with or see why her family is making the comments but since she loves her husband and she herself wouldn\u2019t care if he attended in pajama pants and a tee shirt, her response is \u201ceh, don\u2019t worry about it honey, they just like to tease you about your jeans/tees/whatever it is.\u201d", "OP refuses to answer what exactly it is that they\u2019re wearing to these events.
