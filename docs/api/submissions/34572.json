Play, like pranking and joking, is a mutual experience, and if everyone isn't enjoying it, it needs to stop or change.

That's not playful.\n\nAnd in the middle of all of that...your wife does not have your back.

I also suspect extended families are more likely to tease because they are trying to make up for familiarity they might be lacking, plus it's more fun than making small talk about the weather.\n\nThis just doesn't seem like a big deal.

These are completely valid things for them to wonder.", "Might be but it also might be the polite rock/hard place response.

OP sounds like an immature 22 year old. Grow up and wear something decent for a change.", "I'm guessing he dresses like a 12 year old boy in basketball shorts and hoodies.    \nIf they have been talking about this for three years, put on some real clothes. It isn't that difficult.", "He might just have a clothing problem.", "Maybe the wife thought that hubby would have grown out of his childish ripped clothing stage by now.  \nI'm sure the 'jokes' started as subtle hints to him, but he is too hard arsed to get the message and do indeed embarrass them all with his clothing", "Exactly. If OP is wearing dirty, ripped jeans to an event where everyone else is dressed formally, then OP is being disrespectful.", "TBH I kind of wonder if OP is consistently underdressed for what the wife's family considers to be formal occasions.", "This really makes all the difference.", "Yeah, are they formal occasions where the men are all wearing 3 piece suits for a dinner party or is it casual like a barbecue?", "I think it's the fact that the jeans in question have more holes than denim, and that seems to go with his overall style. I have a feeling if he showed up in regular jeans without shreds or holes, and a decent tshirt or polo shirt , they'd be happy.", "Yeah my family doesn't give a shit about me going to dinner in pajamas because they just want me there and know I'm already making a HUGE effort in just leaving my house.", "Nah, probably just skinny/straight legs and black, or perhaps a textured acid wash, some distressing. I doubt this dude looks like 2008, those jeans are hard to come by these days.", "Oh let him wear whatever the fuck he wants", "He doesn\u2019t say once that he tried to dress nice.", "yeah, his \"I'm not wearing a burlap sack\" sorta has me going- okay but what are you wearing?\n\nare you showing up in gym shorts and a hoodie when everyone else is in slacks and dress shirts? or wearing jeans when everyone else is wearing suits?\n\nlike just totally ignoring the dress code for events and sorta going- this is me, either accept how i dress or don't but if you don't you aren't accepting me?", "This one stung \ud83d\ude02", "Since he said emo jeans I'm assuming an alternative style with the jeans in question being skinny, ripped, and black. Most likely \"too young\" for him which is why he gets comments.", "Or jeans in general aren't appropriate. Or ripped jeans. (If people are wearing jeans they're wearing \"nice\" jeans with for example sweaters and dress shirts. They've dressed up the jeans.)\n\nMy family is pretty casual for family holidays but ripped jeans aren't going to be appropriate. Jeans fine but jeans in a put together way. Not I'm going to hang out with my friends at a bar.", "I have to be honest and say I don't really understand a dress code for family holidays at all. It's not like it's a formal function."]}
