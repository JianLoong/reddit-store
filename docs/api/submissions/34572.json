Sorry, but there it is. If it bothers you, then it's a problem. She could shut this down, but she doesn't. It's not playful if it's not funny to you. It's bullying. And why are they questioning whether you're going to be a good father? This is something your wife should be shutting down, and the fact that she isn't suggests that she agrees with her family. Please don't bring a child into this relationship unless and until you can get this straightened out.

She either agrees to couple therapy or you should leave.", "You have a wife problem.  Her family constantly puts down your attire and is now questioning whether you'll be a suitable father, and your wife says they're being \"playful\"????  No, they're not.\n\nI would heartily suggest that you postpone pregnancy until your wife has your back.  I would also suggest that you tell her that you want her to join you in going LC (or even NC until they apologize for their troubling behavior) and that you want her to tell her family why this is happening and demand the apology herself.\n\nI suspect that this is going to reveal a distressing lack of loyalty, as I doubt she will comply.  \n\nYou might want to consider couples therapy.  But insist upon birth control (preferably the kind you use to be certain there is, in fact, birth control) until this issue is resolved to your satisfaction.\n\nI assure you that if this isn't resolved, you will be put down and emasculated in front of your children while your wife smiles and nods for the rest of your life.

And your wife should have already told them to cut it out, so she's an asshole as well.\n\nBut when others are consistently commenting on your attire like this, then why haven't you considered that you are simply dressing inappropriately for the occasion or the company (or for your age). \n\n\"I admit I dress pretty casually\" might be be more like \"I don't make any effort to look nice even on special occasions\" or even \"I'm kind of a slob but I wear what I want.\"", "NTA, your wife's family is super childish for making fun of something as trivial as clothing.\n\nConsider the fact that she does not stand up for you, and doesn't take your feelings seriously.

This situation could easily be resolved by all sides engaging in respectful conversation around differences in expectations and values, instead of resorting to put-downs and \"jokes\" on one side and petulance on the other.
