Which was the deal from the get go - i.e that he was the stay at home parent.\n\nFirstly - He fails to grasp that if you did work from home,  the company expects you to work from home.  I.e. with reasonable expectations that sometimes life happens and you will get pulled away every so often you will be expected to put in your 40 hours (or whatever your work week is).  Your company sounds great, and very reasonable.  But I expect that they probably have some explicit policies that you would have to abide by (e.g.  a distinct room in your house,  perhaps with a locking door during work hours, a locking file cabinet for any IP, blah blah blah).    Heck pre - covid, a company I worked for would send someone out to make sure that work at home folks had an actual office like that.\n\nSecondly - It should be said that being a writer \\_is\\_ a job.  And, he \\_does\\_ need time to work.   That said, the agreement was that he would be the primary caregiver as his schedule was the most flexible.   IF he needs to work around the baby's various needs,  then he needs to work around the baby's various needs.   I mean, I'm not saying its always going to be roses and song,  as some days the kids need a little more attention.  But again, that was the deal.\n\nIf he doesn't think he has enough time, JK Rowling managed to crank out a book or two while being a parent (and was a single parent).\n\nI would have \\_LOVED\\_ the arrangement he's got with you.

He has been a SAHD for several years now while I worked and supported us financially.

I will say that it is very hard to write while also taking care of kids (even though two of mine are now in school).

And when they\u2019re awake it\u2019s very hard to have them entertain themselves when they can see someone is around. He might have to give up on it altogether while the baby is young, or write at night when you\u2019re back from work (and after he has helped with the household chores). And if you have additional kids, there might need to be additional pauses while they\u2019re infants or toddlers, too.\n\nAnyway you\u2019re totally in the right but I get that it\u2019s hard to write with kids.

I\u2019m a SAHD and he agreed to the sacrifices that come with being the primary caregiver and parent generally. He seems to want to have his cake and eat it too, but that\u2019s just not the reality he agreed to. Maybe is he didn\u2019t even consider what the reality of being a primary caregiver is. He just thought he would sit at home with the baby and do his stuff. \n\nI\u2019ve got bad news for him, primary caregiver is more than a full-time job. on an average day I\u2019m up between five and six. On a good day seven. I\u2019m in Dad mode until mom gets home around 5 PM and then she spends time with him while I make dinner. after we eat she gives him a bath, while I clean up and do dishes. And then bedtime somewhere between seven and eight. A short day for me is 12 hours but I can usually go to 15 or 16 if we get up early and have a bad night on bedtime. \n\nThere are giant waving red flags all over the manipulation he\u2019s trying to pull with you. Of course your child would like you to be around all the time too. That\u2019s one of the biggest sacrifices you are making in this arrangement. By working and being the breadwinner you are giving up time with your child to support your family. But when he says your child wants you there, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s talking about you both being present and having more time as a family. It seems like he\u2019s talking about you taking over parenting duties while he goes and does some thing else, whether that be writing or other things. he\u2019s also showing his misogyny with the whole emasculation thing. That\u2019s a him problem, if it\u2019s even actually a problem and not just an attempt to manipulate you. Is he saying being a parent is emasculating or that you are the breadwinner is emasculating? Because even if he wrote full-time would he become the breadwinner? It seems like he\u2019s just getting started and it\u2019s very very hard to make a living writing until you\u2019re well-established.I can say from a public opinion perspective, almost everyone I meet that finds out I\u2019m a stay at home dad, even if they are surprised by that, think it\u2019s awesome. I can\u2019t think of a single time, other than on Reddit, where someone tried to denigrate me or attempted to malign my masculinity because I am the primary caregiver. Cultural views on parenting have changed and the days of the boomer absentee father are behind us. Your husband needs to enter the 21st century and step up.\n\nAll of that said, and I want to preface this statement by saying it really does seem like you were trying to offer him solutions, so don\u2019t take this as me saying you aren\u2019t trying to work with him. Because you are. But assuming there isn\u2019t a major Change in the dynamic, like if he accepts one of the things you have offered, you two need to come together and find at least some time for him that is planned and somewhat protected for him to do other things. Because consistent uninterrupted time is generally not on the table when caring for a toddler and after a full day of doing so the exhaustion is real and it\u2019s hard to be able to shift and do serious work at the end of the day. If you do really want to see him succeed and grow as an author, which I think you do, that has to be given respected space to happen. Maybe that means setting up childcare for two days a week, so he gets 4 to 8 hours, depending on schedules and what works for y\u2019all, to actually devote himself to this craft that you both want to be his future. During the summer my MIL was able to watch my child a couple days a week. That gave me time to actually get into my woodshop and build. When I was able to have that part time coverage, usually from about 10 to 4, I was actually really happy with our balance. Unfortunately, due to scheduling, that time has been lost for me. And it\u2019s one thing in our parenting dynamic we still need to better adjust to. If you want this to be a future for him, there needs to be at least some time where is treated the same as when you go to work. Because writing really isn\u2019t something that can usually be done in short bursts or with regular interruption. It may not be the amount of time that he wants, but maybe a better balance can be found. \n\nBut looping all the way back up to the beginning of this long ass comment, that\u2019s what I signed up for and I understand that and the same needs to go for him. You had a child and that means there are sacrifices on all fronts. Welcome to parenthood. He needs to step up, drop the manipulation and woe is me bullshit, and be a parent and partner. But that doesn\u2019t mean that his frustrations aren\u2019t real and that if he can come together with you, I\u2019m sure you can find some solutions that may not fit his delusion of what this looks like, but may offer a better balance.", "NTA he started shit, he got shit back.

I can attest to trying to both write and be stay at home parent and believe me the writing career will suffer. If you are both serious about him making a go of it, he needs a regular amount of uninterrupted work time too. You also need uninterrupted work time. If you WFH you need a locked space and no childcare in work hours.  Either you stagger schedules and childcare or you get a nanny or he accepts being the SAHF and you accept he gets time evenings and weekends to write while you take care of baby. Is he a writer or is he a SAHF who has a dabble hobby? Thinking the latter if he does not agree would be the emasculation. This is not hard, it\u2019s a project management discussion.

He's the SAHP, his job is the baby, at least during the day when you're working. Working from home means just that - WORKING at home.

When you WFH, you need to set boundaries, because as I said, you need to be able to work. The fact that you're doing it at home has no bearing on what your job responsibilities are, and you need to be able to fulfill them.

Sounds like you're ok with that setup, but if it was me, I'd be PISSED if my partners behavior forced me into the office. \n\nI will say though, leveraging your position as breadwinner borders on financial abuse.

Since you are actually employed outside the home, he needs to let you do your job. Otherwise he needs to realize that being a stay at home parent IS his job, and that writing is more of a hobby at this point - or let you pay for a nanny while he writes, which is more than generous, even though sacrifices will have to be made.

Your husband might be scared about being unable to handle taking care of the baby on his own. This might not be the case, however it would have been a nice gesture if you brought it up and talked about it. Your husband disagreeing with taking money from the play budget for a nanny is understandable, but also ridiculous given the circumstances.

This is not meant as a guilt thing like \"you gotta always be there for your child 100% of the time\", because that's not realistic. But first words, first walk, just random cute moments that will never be captured on camera appropriately but might forever be etched in your heart... none of those things take into account a typical work schedule. So just know that going fully into the office will very likely cause you to miss a number of potentially-important events in your child's life.\n\nAdditionally, studies show that people are \\_typically\\_ (but not always) happier with a hybrid remote work strategy.

I'm not one to mock artistic professions, writing IS a \"real job,\" but working from home comes with certain understandings.  And he broke your agreement and you working from the office is a fair compromise since you know he expects more from you than is fair.", "You gave him three options:\n\n1. he can get a job and contribute financially\n2. he can stay home and be a stay-at-home parent and actually do that work\n3. you can use your mutual finances to hire a nanny so you can work, the nanny watches the baby, and he can ... write some books?\n\nNTA. Tbh option 3 seems nuts. He just needs to step up. The only reason he feels emasculated is because he's being called out for not growing up and being a man about this. As in, an adult that contributes and takes responsibility.", "Since he's not technically \"working\", in any case of divorce, OP would have to pay alimony to him. that's the worst part... She's better off, forcing him to take a part time to show that he's working and not a SAHD, so that she shouldn't have to pay the alimony to him.", "Most of the time with a young child is making sure they don't kill themselves. There isn't a ton of stuff you really gotta do. At 1 they are crawling around but you can just make a nice safe area for them through baby proofing and keep in line of sight. You can otherwise watch TV, write, clean, listen to podcast, etc. \n\nDangerous age is like 2 - 3 where they are old enough to get into trouble but too young to know any better. \n\n4+ (depending on the kid) you just need to check in on them. They can be pretty independent but often will want to play with you etc. \n\nBy time they're like 7 or 8 the amount of watching you need to do is very minimal, and thats when they're not at school.", "I think the husband either had no idea what taking care of an infant entails, or he assumed he could force OP to be both primary breadwinner and caregiver while he putters around.", ">The ahsolute nerve of your princess of a husband \n\nHad to laugh at this - he is a princess, isn't he!? \n\nAnd yet he dare complain about being emasculated. \ud83d\ude44", "Situation with my ex was similar; I had a corporate role and he was a gardener. He continuously insinuated that office work was not a real job and thought no one in the office knew what hard work was. However he was happy to let me carry him for years when he didn't have enough work (which was every winter).\n\nI think I just realised that he was negging me because my higher paid job emasculated him. \n\nWhen after 7 years I called it quits and gave his lack of work or motivation to get more work as one of several breaking points, he goes 'oh you're all about the money \ud83d\ude44'. Despite the fact that I ignored it for years because I loved him.", "Reminds me of a guy I worked with.  He'd go home from work and then straight to the Casino and play Poker.  By all accounts, he was pretty decent.  He'd come in most days and talk about the hundreds of dollars he won.  Naturally he decided he was going to quit and do it full time.\n\n18 months later, he came back.  I didn't see him much after that because of his role and the fact I was made redundant not that long after, but he \"got lazy and started playing Xbox all day\".  If you don't have a certain drive (which probably would have you working at least 12-16 hours a day anyways), it can be very hard to maintain a schedule.", "So I'm hearing.. there's a romance line coming out from a publisher, who will soon tick all my boxes? \ud83d\udc40\n\nMay never make a convention to get your books signed, but by the Mother I'mma be waiting for your stories!", "Yep! My mom has published 13 books, with a big publisher. They keep a bunch of the money, but they do all the work and deal with things like getting her in a small anthology and getting her book read so readers could listen to it. \n\nThere are some very successful self published authors. But probably 75% of the self published stuff I've seen on Amazon is all but unreadable for a lack of editing. \n\nAnyway, OP's husband wants to not work, stay home, and not care for the baby either. Unfortunately that isn't really how things work.", "All the best writers struggled a lot anyway. His life is too carefree to have any meaningful ideas.", "\"Mummy! My wife emasculated me, do something. Make her give me my masculinity back!\"\n\nSorry couldn't resist \ud83e\udd23", "Because obviously it\u2019s the wOmAN\u2019s job to do childcare.

A lot of writing time is actually thinking time, and many writers would argue that doing other activities (like taking care of your child) helps stimulate creativity. Hell, he could be using this time to write a memoir on SAHD, working moms, and juggling child rearing. Instead he\u2019s complaining about you prioritizing the family\u2019s financial well-being. NTA.", "Writing is work if someone is willing to pay you to do it, just like baking or woodworking or coding or whatever. If no one is willing to pay you to do it, it's a hobby.", "That's why I like reading books on RoyalRoad, author gets a lot of readers comments on each chapter and when the publish, to say KU they take that book down, finish editing and publish, then continue writing the series until it's time to publish the next section. With the completed books down if someone finds a well reviewed book in a genre they like, they're usually willing to pay to read it(amzn lets them leave up a couple chapters as a sample). Plus they can get donations and link to ptrn on there. And when people do read your books off amzn, they can go straight to the new chapters. But yeah, the ones that publish a first book at an affordable rate then jack it up to $10, those people never see me return, not with the amount of *ok* readable content out there. I just read to much and make too little for that.", "Anthony Trollope was a postal clerk who invented the postbox. \n\nBram Stoker? Clerk.", "Yep. Anyone saying OP's husband \"also has a job that he's working at\" is missing the critical ingredient -- income. He hit the lottery once before on writing, which is amazing, but he's now back to super long odds to make any realistic income at all. \n\nIt's possible that he is feeling depressed about this. To get close to success and have it dry up probably haunts him, and now he wants to keep writing to finally \"make it.\" Getting a \"real job\" means giving up the dream, in his eyes. Ah well.", "Was this oh so logical and not reacting emotionally at all ( /s ) man able to then explain in detail and logic all the ways it is in fact  \u201cdifferent\u201d?\u2026\u2026bc I\u2019m thinking he could not do that at all\u2026.", "Wait, he was unemployed and he waited until they were **huddling in front of a space heater in a freezing house** before it occurred to him to get a job?\n\nThat\u2019s some *I Capture the Castle* vibes right there.", "Absolutely.  I've self published via Amazon because I have no desire to \"make it big\". It's just to get the stories out of my head. I keep telling people I could take a picture of a poop, photoshop it onto a page in word, and publish it tomorrow if I really wanted. Self publishing is easy.

Thank you.\n\n(Feel free to skip personal rant here lol)\nI've spent a lot of years getting over my internalized misogyny (not done yet, ftr) and only after college was I really able to embrace my feminity. In a way I \"emasculated\" myself and honestly it has been almost exclusively a positive thing. I do get some shit for styling myself high femme, especially in a male dominated field, but it's so worth it to feel like my expression matches who I actually am and not just \"ew at color and dresses and makeup\" because some boy convinced me of that at age 7. Emasculation is always used as a negative when referring to men though, when the most attractive any man has been to me has been when they are more \"feminine\" - that is nurturing, emotionally vulnerable, caretaking of me or the house, etc. I've never been more attracted to a man because of any of these \"masculine\" traits - stoicism gets old really fast and I want a partner with a job because I want an adult not because of any hangups about men needing to be \"breadwinners.\" Hell I make way more than my current boyfriend *and* I bake bread at home for him, but he still brings much to the relationship that those become minor points.", "I'd heard on a podcast recently that the best thing any writer and/or actor can do is actually have had or maintain an actual day job.
