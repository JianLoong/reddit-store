So he could technically fit a bit of writing in during a nap or even brainstorm if he can\u2019t write in short bursts.", "I'm primarily a SAHM too (Adjunct prof on the side), and this is basically how I do thingstoo. While my husband is at work, I do all the children and house stuff, in the evenings (or naptime), is when I do grading, and stuff. I usually take a couple hours on the weekend to record lectures as needed too.", ">He didn\u2019t lick his attitude off the ground.\n\nAbsolutely amazing phrase!", "All of our accounts are shared accounts. Neither one of us has a personal account for private purchases or anything.  For example we agreed on a gift limit for Christmas and we each will spend that much or less out of our \"fun\" account.", "Why does op suck? Husband has shown a pattern of behavior of trying to get her to take care of the baby during work time. Clearly from his statement op \u201cshould choose wfh so [op] can help more with the baby\u201d he expects her to take care of the baby during work hours going forward. He\u2019s the asshole. They decided together he would be the stay at home parent. He doesn\u2019t get to offload his responsibilities while she works because he feels emasculated", "I\u2019m Irish. It would be in common usage here (sometimes \u2018stones\u2019 instead of \u2018ground\u2019). I have only just realised how bonkers it sounds!!", "I understand thank you", "There have been many posts from SAHM's who wish their partner would WFH so that they could help more with the baby. Mostly they wish that they could cut out the travel time, etc, which allows them to help more with the baby. Why do you assume that he means so she can help during work hours? (I do know that he was being crappy about that a while ago, but she discussed it with him, and he changed his behaviour).", "I put in my original comment why I feel like OP is also an AH in this situation. OP seems to unilaterally make decisions and uses being the breadwinner as the excuse to do so.", "That's amazing. I have family in Ireland and spent a summer there and never heard of this one. Definitely tucking it away for later!", "He\u2019s contributing nothing to the situation. He doesn\u2019t fully take care of the child during the hours he\u2019s supposed and he doesn\u2019t earn money. She offered options. He\u2019s the one making unilateral decisions that she needs to care for the baby during work hours", "Look, he\u2019s trying to make a career as a writer. I asked OP if she makes time for him to have personal time when she gets home from work or on the weekends. She hasn\u2019t answered that so unless she says \u201cyes, I take over child care when I get home so my husband can also focus on his career\u201d then maybe I\u2019d change my vote. But until then, it sounds like OP doesn\u2019t support her husbands career and expects him to do all of the childcare 24/7. If the genders were reversed, everyone would be saying OP needs to support their husbands career as well. Also, no where in the post does OP say this is a hobby for husband, she says that it\u2019s his career."]}
