Which was the deal from the get go - i.e that he was the stay at home parent.\n\nFirstly - He fails to grasp that if you did work from home,  the company expects you to work from home.  I.e. with reasonable expectations that sometimes life happens and you will get pulled away every so often you will be expected to put in your 40 hours (or whatever your work week is).  Your company sounds great, and very reasonable.  But I expect that they probably have some explicit policies that you would have to abide by (e.g.  a distinct room in your house,  perhaps with a locking door during work hours, a locking file cabinet for any IP, blah blah blah).    Heck pre - covid, a company I worked for would send someone out to make sure that work at home folks had an actual office like that.\n\nSecondly - It should be said that being a writer \\_is\\_ a job.  And, he \\_does\\_ need time to work.   That said, the agreement was that he would be the primary caregiver as his schedule was the most flexible.   IF he needs to work around the baby's various needs,  then he needs to work around the baby's various needs.   I mean, I'm not saying its always going to be roses and song,  as some days the kids need a little more attention.  But again, that was the deal.\n\nIf he doesn't think he has enough time, JK Rowling managed to crank out a book or two while being a parent (and was a single parent).\n\nI would have \\_LOVED\\_ the arrangement he's got with you.

He has been a SAHD for several years now while I worked and supported us financially.

I will say that it is very hard to write while also taking care of kids (even though two of mine are now in school).

And when they\u2019re awake it\u2019s very hard to have them entertain themselves when they can see someone is around. He might have to give up on it altogether while the baby is young, or write at night when you\u2019re back from work (and after he has helped with the household chores). And if you have additional kids, there might need to be additional pauses while they\u2019re infants or toddlers, too.\n\nAnyway you\u2019re totally in the right but I get that it\u2019s hard to write with kids.

I\u2019m a SAHD and he agreed to the sacrifices that come with being the primary caregiver and parent generally. He seems to want to have his cake and eat it too, but that\u2019s just not the reality he agreed to. Maybe is he didn\u2019t even consider what the reality of being a primary caregiver is. He just thought he would sit at home with the baby and do his stuff. \n\nI\u2019ve got bad news for him, primary caregiver is more than a full-time job. on an average day I\u2019m up between five and six. On a good day seven. I\u2019m in Dad mode until mom gets home around 5 PM and then she spends time with him while I make dinner. after we eat she gives him a bath, while I clean up and do dishes. And then bedtime somewhere between seven and eight. A short day for me is 12 hours but I can usually go to 15 or 16 if we get up early and have a bad night on bedtime. \n\nThere are giant waving red flags all over the manipulation he\u2019s trying to pull with you. Of course your child would like you to be around all the time too. That\u2019s one of the biggest sacrifices you are making in this arrangement. By working and being the breadwinner you are giving up time with your child to support your family. But when he says your child wants you there, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s talking about you both being present and having more time as a family. It seems like he\u2019s talking about you taking over parenting duties while he goes and does some thing else, whether that be writing or other things. he\u2019s also showing his misogyny with the whole emasculation thing. That\u2019s a him problem, if it\u2019s even actually a problem and not just an attempt to manipulate you. Is he saying being a parent is emasculating or that you are the breadwinner is emasculating? Because even if he wrote full-time would he become the breadwinner? It seems like he\u2019s just getting started and it\u2019s very very hard to make a living writing until you\u2019re well-established.I can say from a public opinion perspective, almost everyone I meet that finds out I\u2019m a stay at home dad, even if they are surprised by that, think it\u2019s awesome. I can\u2019t think of a single time, other than on Reddit, where someone tried to denigrate me or attempted to malign my masculinity because I am the primary caregiver. Cultural views on parenting have changed and the days of the boomer absentee father are behind us. Your husband needs to enter the 21st century and step up.\n\nAll of that said, and I want to preface this statement by saying it really does seem like you were trying to offer him solutions, so don\u2019t take this as me saying you aren\u2019t trying to work with him. Because you are. But assuming there isn\u2019t a major Change in the dynamic, like if he accepts one of the things you have offered, you two need to come together and find at least some time for him that is planned and somewhat protected for him to do other things. Because consistent uninterrupted time is generally not on the table when caring for a toddler and after a full day of doing so the exhaustion is real and it\u2019s hard to be able to shift and do serious work at the end of the day. If you do really want to see him succeed and grow as an author, which I think you do, that has to be given respected space to happen. Maybe that means setting up childcare for two days a week, so he gets 4 to 8 hours, depending on schedules and what works for y\u2019all, to actually devote himself to this craft that you both want to be his future. During the summer my MIL was able to watch my child a couple days a week. That gave me time to actually get into my woodshop and build. When I was able to have that part time coverage, usually from about 10 to 4, I was actually really happy with our balance. Unfortunately, due to scheduling, that time has been lost for me. And it\u2019s one thing in our parenting dynamic we still need to better adjust to. If you want this to be a future for him, there needs to be at least some time where is treated the same as when you go to work. Because writing really isn\u2019t something that can usually be done in short bursts or with regular interruption. It may not be the amount of time that he wants, but maybe a better balance can be found. \n\nBut looping all the way back up to the beginning of this long ass comment, that\u2019s what I signed up for and I understand that and the same needs to go for him. You had a child and that means there are sacrifices on all fronts. Welcome to parenthood. He needs to step up, drop the manipulation and woe is me bullshit, and be a parent and partner. But that doesn\u2019t mean that his frustrations aren\u2019t real and that if he can come together with you, I\u2019m sure you can find some solutions that may not fit his delusion of what this looks like, but may offer a better balance.", "NTA he started shit, he got shit back.

I can attest to trying to both write and be stay at home parent and believe me the writing career will suffer. If you are both serious about him making a go of it, he needs a regular amount of uninterrupted work time too. You also need uninterrupted work time. If you WFH you need a locked space and no childcare in work hours.  Either you stagger schedules and childcare or you get a nanny or he accepts being the SAHF and you accept he gets time evenings and weekends to write while you take care of baby. Is he a writer or is he a SAHF who has a dabble hobby? Thinking the latter if he does not agree would be the emasculation. This is not hard, it\u2019s a project management discussion.

He's the SAHP, his job is the baby, at least during the day when you're working. Working from home means just that - WORKING at home.

When you WFH, you need to set boundaries, because as I said, you need to be able to work. The fact that you're doing it at home has no bearing on what your job responsibilities are, and you need to be able to fulfill them.

Sounds like you're ok with that setup, but if it was me, I'd be PISSED if my partners behavior forced me into the office. \n\nI will say though, leveraging your position as breadwinner borders on financial abuse.

Since you are actually employed outside the home, he needs to let you do your job. Otherwise he needs to realize that being a stay at home parent IS his job, and that writing is more of a hobby at this point - or let you pay for a nanny while he writes, which is more than generous, even though sacrifices will have to be made.

Always on the lookout for new authors and books, especially fantasy and/or historical fiction.", "Historical romance is my favourite", "The company that I will be publishing with is Falstaff Books.  If you like vampire dark fantasy, the Quincy Harker series is great.  If you like comedic horror, I recommend the Bubba the Monster Hunter series and its offshoots.  I really like Lucy Blue's Guinivere's Revenge and the subsequent books because  it is like Nick and Nora from the Thin Man series.  There is no fantasy element to that.  Sort of Agatha Christie-ish.   I strongly suggest the Wrinkle and Crime series by JD Blackrose too."]}
