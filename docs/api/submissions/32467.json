Tell your mom that it's something you all can discuss in the future and you need to concentrate on your education right now. Don't agree, don't disagree. just \"sounds like a good idea when the time comes\". \n\nFocus on your education. \n\nAnd make sure your mom has ZERO access to your bank accounts. You may have to open new ones in a different bank just to be absolutely sure. Check your credit report regularly. And don't sign ANYTHING. It may be a good idea to save some funds if you need to move out. \n\nIt looks like your mother has an extraordinary sense of entitlement and will not drop it. Be vague, give yourself peace for the next few years, then leave, live your life, and buy a place for yourself. \n\nReasonable people have kids and raise them, and don't expect them to cosign their mortgage or fund their lifestyle once they are adults.", "NTA \u2013 paying for you while raising you was your parents duty", "NTA.

You didn't ask to be born. This was 100% her responsibility, and you're not obligated to \"repay\" her for doing the bare minimum expected from a parent.", "NTA.  How immature of your mother to try to put that kind of guilt and responsibility on you.  Shame on her!\n\nIt sounds like she actually did a good job of raising you and that you are a motivated and responsible adult.  Good on ya!  Saying no to this ridiculous request is ALSO responsible.  Yeah she raised you, that was HER responsibility.  \n\nStand your ground and don't let her manipulate you.", "Absolutly NTA - She chose to have a kid. That also includes raising them, and providing for them until they are able to provide for themselves.

She chose to have you, so she was responsible for raising you and paying for you when you were a child. \n\nIf you sign a mortgage saying you\u2019ll live there, then she rents it out, that is considered fraud by the bank.  \n\nTell her that no, you\u2019ll not engage in fraud.\n\nFor now, though, I would just say nothing.  Get through school.  Get a job.  Save up some cash.  Then go shopping for your own home that you want to live in.  Beat mom to the punch.  Then say:  \u201cSorry, mom, I\u2019ve already applied to borrow for the home I\u2019m moving in to.  If you want to buy more rental property and have me co-sign for it, get an attorney to draw up a partnership agreement for me to consider.  \u201c", "NTA\n\nYou do not owe your parents for raising you. They chose to have children. You did not choose to be born. \n\nYou *owe* your parents *nothing* just because you are their child. If you live in their house, then you follow their (reasonable) rules. If they offer you respect, then you can return that respect.\n\nThis is not respectful.\n\nHere are some things you can do to protect yourself from financial abuse.\n\n[Check your credit](https://www.usa.gov/credit-reports), to make sure no one has taken out loans or opened credit cards in your name.\n\nThen, [Lock down your credit reports](https://www.usa.gov/credit-freeze).\n\nMake sure your parents do not have any access to your bank account. If they ever had access to the one you have now, then find a new credit union and get a completely different account. Move all your money to the new account.\n\nFind your social security card, birth certificate, passport, and any other personal documentation and hide it. Someplace they can't find it. Preferrably out of the house.\n\nI don't know how unreasonable your parents are, but you may need to be prepared to move out if things get bad enough. Keep that in mind. Make plans in case it happens. Find out what rights you have as an adult living in your parent's house. You may have tenent rights even if you don't pay rent. If so, they can't just kick you out, they have to give notice.\n\nAsk around at your school and find out of they have financial counselors or classes in financial literacy. Find out what a credit report is, how do credit and loans work, what about taxes, renting, saving, how to recognize scams, that sort of thing.\n\nDo not sign anything your mother asks you to sign. If necessary, take it to a lawyer.", "NTA whew nope.", "NTA. You dont own her anything! She raising you and your brother was literally her job! You didnt ask to be born. That was her decision. \n\nSince you are still in school, you better not making her angry. Everytime she talks about that, say you will talk about it at the time. Until then, save as much money you can (dont show it to her or tell her, she will probably charge you rent because of it). When the time comes and she ask you once again, you say no and move out.", "It's literal a parents job legally and morally to provide for the kids who didn't ask to be conceived.", "Nta.

Yeah, hard pass.", "You are NTA.  Do not let your mother manipulate or bully you for only her financial benefit.  You stick to your guns.  You owe her nothing for raising you as a child as it was her responsibility to do that as the parent if a child.", "I would check your credit score and make sure she hasn't taken anything out in your name. Something about how she reacted doesn't sit right with me.  Definitely not the asshole.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t ask to be born. Therefore you owe her nothing for raising you since that was her choice.", "she called me selfish and told me that she doesn't ask for rent for me to live with her and that i should pay her back for all her hard work raising me and my brother\n\nyour mother is the AH, you dont raise children in hopes to be paid back in future", "NTA.\n\nQuestions: If your mother has 2 properties, and already owns the house you live in, why does she need a cosigner? Does she not have enough security in those 3 properties to secure the loan? If that is the case, she cannot afford another property, and you would be stupid to cosign.\nIf you cosign for your mother, but your name is not on the property title,  why would that prevent you from obtaining first home buyers privileges? You would not be a home buyer/owner. The major issue would be your ability to obtain a loan to purchase your own home, or, even for any other purpose. Do not cosign for your mother! If she goes down, she takes you with her. NTA for refusing to cosign. Good luck.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
