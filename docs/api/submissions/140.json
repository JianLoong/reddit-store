Some people who want share sooo bad just want to gobble down everything and when you complain \"It isn't my problem when you eat so slow\". That's the same that order the most expensive dishes and drinks (and try to take a whole meal as Ieftovers) when someone else pays or wants that you share the bill while everybody else had a salad.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nI don't think there are any arcane rules for being polite in the UK. I am not in the UK but have had formal tea as described.\n\nThe ones I have gone to have been very upscale - much like OP describes - and generally there is ONE of each thing and the underlying premise or assumption is that each person attending will take ONE so that everyone samples everything. There is a reason they are called \"tea sandwiches\" or that traditionally small stuff is served - e.g. you aren't served a large serving of cake but a petit four or some other miniature tart. The intent is not to fill yourself up one sandwich or one dessert item but to have the ability to sample a variety of treats.\n\nThat there was one greedy person who chose to violate the unwritten \"rules\" of participating in a tea meant that OP had to state the obvious - that each person was entitled to ONE of each specific item. As stated, at least at the elegant teas I have been to there is only one of each separate item and the number of each item is based on the number of guests. \n\nThis is different of course than a tea party at someone's home where typically there are a random number of plated items just like a cocktail party where Hors d'oeuvres are served. Typically in those situations there are a recommended number of items based on number of guests but it is possible for a guest to have several of the same item as it isn't a strict one for one like a formal tea at a commercial establishment.", "No I just very casually said \u201cSo shall me & you have it from this one & you two have it from that\u201d just so everyone knows which is theirs. It\u2019s something that needs to be done at any afternoon tea involving a big group anyway, but I just made sure she ended up with the stand she\u2019d already started on.", "Yeah it just seemed like her \u201cwe\u2019ll just share\u201d was an insincere attempt at covering up her selfish ways. She wasn\u2019t paying attention or caring about who was going to miss out on the other end of the table by her grabbing things from their stand. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t going to affect me but I find everyday injustice like that for other people really annoying as most people will let it go & take the hit.", "I agree. You were only ensuring that  everyone had their fair share of the samplings. She was strangely and persistently aggressive.", "Afternoon tea is known very well in the UK & how it works & we were informed what you get each days beforehand by text & in the tea room before it started.", "Yes it\u2019s exactly like that, as if someone was taking your chicken that you ordered & paid for from the plate in front of you. The only difference with afternoon tea is that it\u2019s served in a tiered stand of plates & multiple people\u2019s afternoon tea can be served on it for space.", "Yes it\u2019s all very specific & intentional & everyone in the UK knows how formal afternoon tea works & if she didn\u2019t we were informed in advance & at the tea room itself. They even took away half the items on one of the stands on our table when they found out one person wasn\u2019t there & were going to pack it up for her to receive, so every item counts.", "I don\u2019t think I was even sassy with it, I felt like I was just stating the obvious very calmly as I was genuinely perplexed that she thought we were going to \u201cshare\u201d when it\u2019s already assigned very specifically to each person. What is there even to share, the only other option is to eat *someone else\u2019s* share.", "I have had many many afternoon teas in so many places all over the country (we are big fans of it!) & have never come across one that refills - in high end & more casual places. That would be great but not sure how that would work especially in fancy places where the items are pricey - that would be a buffet style essentially & you wouldn\u2019t be able to take home your leftovers. \nDo you perhaps mean more informal cake & tea places, I\u2019ve seen some that give unlimited cake, but that\u2019s very different to proper afternoon tea with high end dainty items. \n\nIn any case it was made very clear before that day & whilst at the tea room that it was a traditional afternoon tea & what exactly each person will get.", "Yeah when I was writing it I did think the Americans are going to love this. \n\nSomeone else on the table then brought up wether cream or jam goes on first on scones & that can start wars here.", "I\u2019m not sure she even looked at what she was taking, I think she was just one of those people that don\u2019t think about anything or anyone in group situations & how their behaviour affects others.", "Afternoon tea is not an exotic foreign ritual. My mother and I used to have it in New York all the time. I sometimes still go with friends.", "No, it\u2019s pretty normal here too. Plenty of places serve afternoon tea. Same etiquette applies - the items are doled out on a per person basis so that each person gets to try everything. You don\u2019t just grab from someone else\u2019s tray stand.", "There\u2019s two lovely tea places near me\u2014I\u2019m in New England.\n\nOne place does exactly as described here\u2014 there are exactly the number of sandwiches/cakes as there are people at the table for tea. Everyone gets one of each.\n\nThe other place you can order what you want for tea as general categories, say you want sandwiches and cakes, but not sweets. You can also pick the number of each that you get. So you can order 10 sandwiches and 5 scones and 3 fairy cakes if that\u2019s what your group wants. So there\u2019s a little more flexibility in what you can take, because you are able to tailor the goodies to your specifications.\n\nIt\u2019s sort of like the difference between ordering a prix fixe or table d\u2019hote menu, where you pretty much get what the chef has decided for you, i.e., the situation in the OP, or ordering ala carts.", "It\u2019s not really hyper specific, if you ordered & paid for a chicken dish for yourself in the US then would it be okay for a stranger on your table to grab chicken from your plate from the other end of the table just because she also ordered the same chicken & hers is also in front of her. It\u2019s the exact same thing, the only difference is afternoon tea is served on a stand & like this one two people\u2019s worth on one stand to save space. It\u2019s still just *your* afternoon tea.", "It was reiterated over & over before & during the afternoon tea what exactly you get each (as I described) & the concept is known by everyone very well in the UK.", "In that case would you be okay if you got half of the food you paid for & not the full afternoon tea experience & someone got double?", "Oh gosh people who order really expensive items but don\u2019t acknowledge it when you go to share the bill at the end make me mad. \n\nI had a really awkward situation awhile back where we were sharing the driving to our weekly meets, every week a different person would drive us to a location of their choice & pay for the parking so it was fair. \nExcept one friend started having car issues when it was her turn so I drove to her location of choice, which wasn\u2019t a massive deal, but then when it was came to paying for parking she\u2019d leave it to me as she automatically was going along with \u201cthe person who brought their car pays for parking each week\u201d, except it wasn\u2019t my week or my choice of location (of an expensive parking area!) & I was just doing the driving part because I had to. I don\u2019t think she was doing it on purpose, she was being oblivious & I felt too awkward to say anything. \n\nI did at least offset it though by then only going to free parking spots when it was my turn!", "Sounds perfectly reasonable to me. \n\nIn my experience most people who wants everyone to \u201cjust share\u201d eat more than their fair share and also do it very fast. And that\u2019s not sharing, that\u2019s taking.", "I think she reacted out of embarrassment. Don't take it to heart.", "And what if one of them had had special dietary needs like was mentioned and she's just grabbing the only ones they can eat. So rude.", "I'm in the US but would know not to do that as well. Even if not but politely corrected I wouldn't have a hissy fit over it.", "I have to question if this is her first time.", "Traditional afternoon tea service. Doesn't matter high end or more affordable - my experiences throughout the UK have more often than not included offers to refill sandwiches, etc. As well as refills on tea or coffee. I don't think that's utterly uncommon. It seems more the norm. And yes, that includes dainty items. \n\nBut this seems like a weird non traditional set up, no? That the business went out of their way to specify before going the exact items each individual will be served and then again made that clear again at the tea room? Sure, places provide a menu but this exact items included seems weird. So maybe thay threw off the other friend.", " Obviously cream first", "You can participate in any number of exotic rituals in NYC; not sure that's sufficient to prove it isn't one.", "Yes you can do that at all places that do afternoon tea as well in the UK including this one.

It could have had special dietary items for one/both of them.", "Love the user name. You\u2019d totally get it. I\u2019m in the US and I didn\u2019t know what to expect when I went to \u201chigh tea\u201d.  When they set a little tiered thing with bite sized sandwiches between each of two people you\u2019d get right away that it\u2019s for those two. Then after everyone ate some, we started brokering trades  - but we were a table of eight friends, not strangers. I was with my young daughter, so ours had half of its sandwiches being more simple, like plain cheeses and pbj.  Even those items were amazing. I just don\u2019t like tea.

It is really surprising to me as I don\u2019t know how that works in terms of costs if it\u2019s unlimited. I\u2019ve known tea to be refilled but even that most places charge for extras!\n\nNo it was a completely normal traditional afternoon tea. It\u2019s because we were at an event & the afternoon tea was part of it & included in what we had paid for the whole event hence the texts beforehand to let everyone know what we\u2019ll be getting.

We won, they recognized our independence, and now we can be friends again, and even share meals and beverages. Do try to keep up.", "That is such a terrible move for multiple reasons. We had a large family gathering when our son was born. I made en enourmous amount of baked goods and I could hardly sleep because I knew that one couple would let their kids go wild. I even talked my sister (who is excellent at giving stern looks) to keep an eye out. Sure enough on of the kids licks the toppings from the more exclusive aka expensive mini-cakes and discards half before taking another. I didn\u2019t see it because I was running around hosting but my sister told the kid and the parents that either you eat all of the cookie or none of the cookie. \n\nI still get upset at that couple.", "I've had it happen at group events where there are specific dishes made for the vegetarian/vegans and even marked and others rush and take them not leaving them for those who they're actually for. It's very frustrating. People don't think sometimes", "Well I don't even know where you live! Try asking on a local forum and I am sure many people can point you in the right direction to which teas are available where they are happy to provide refills. \n\nIts not that complicated cost wise. The restaurant isn't going to lose money on a couple of extra sandwiches - you are paying for the experience of having tea so if one table is especially fond of something, they give you another tiny sandwich. \ud83d\ude09 Sure, there may be events that have some sort of one off rules or whatever, but I don't think most people are picking afternoon tea as an efficient way to go hog wild and abuse the system to get an extra scone and stuff themself to the gill. How many desserts can a person eat? \n\nAgternoon tea isn't this complicated even in the UK. No one will gasp at the order in which someone puts items on their scone. That's a trope and a joke.", "I mean, It's not like Chicago is some tiny Midwestern backwater, it's the 3rd largest city in the US and pretty cosmopolitan, to be fair to my friends in Chicago.", "This does seem to be a really annoying issue at buffet style events, people make sure they\u2019ve done the right thing & notified their dietary needs & the organisers go out of their way to accommodate them. And then the people who can eat everything will eat both leaving those who are restricted without. \n\nNot sure how it can be prevented without resorting to keeping the other food under lockdown & only released to the people who follow that diet!

I am in the UK?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t really matter that you go to afternoon tea places with refills, plenty of places don\u2019t & this was one of them & the thread is about taking someone else\u2019s food out of their plate. Calling it weird & non traditional because they don\u2019t do refills or because the owner hosted the whole place for us & told us about the menu..is weird.", "Oh yes. But it's pretty American.", "Yes, you are in the UK, but without knowing where you live recommendations on tea venues won't be of much use to you, and that's what you asked for. \n\nIf this is indeed one of the places where 2 designated people have a designated plate, great. Your instructions are fine. But many places don't work like that, so I don't think the other woman was wildly out of line for not getting this process. Because at most teas this just isn't a big deal. You explained in your post that this is how its always done and this is how people always approach tea, and I am pointing out thats just not the case. \n\nIf everyone has very specific items that are theirs to eat, and only those specific items their tiers become meaningless. It takes away the shared eating aspect of the whole event. They might as well just serve one place in front of each person. \n\nIt's not weird that the owner told you the menu, or that the entire place was rented to one group, and I don't know why you think I implied that. But I am not sure how 'this is the menu translates to each individual gets 2 cucumber sandwiches and you eat from this side of this tier.", "Heathen"]}
