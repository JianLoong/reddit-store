{"id": 9818, "submission_id": "110ub19", "title": "AITA for wanting to watch the Super Bowl in my home theatre?", "selftext": "First-world problem here... but I'm being called an AH for it. A brief summary:\n\nI spent most of the pandemic turning my basement into a world-class home theatre. I designed it, I spent the money, I spent the time. It took a lot of effort. It's a work of art, with a 120-inch screen, laser projector, Dolby Atmos sound system, comfy sofas, popcorn machine and snack bar. It's all as awesome as it sounds.\n\nNeedless to say, it's become very popular... with family, with friends, with the kids. People are over all the time watching TV, movies and playing video games. It's great -- I love I've created something so many people can appreciate and enjoy.\n\nWhile the vast majority of the time this theatre is available, I've made it clear there are times when I want it for myself... certain sporting events, and most certainly the Super Bowl (which is kicking off shortly).\n\nI made it clear anyone who wants to join me is welcome... there will be popcorn, pizza and drinks. Come on over, should be great. My wife is off doing something else and our kids, teenagers, are off somewhere else. As it turns out, I thought I might have it all to myself and that's fine but, like I said, anyone was welcome to join me.\n\nI got a call yesterday from family (wife's sister-in-law, who's married to my wife's brother, who have a couple of kids 11 and 9) asking if they could come over for it. Sure, I said, but I didn't know you guys were sports fans... I asked if they even knew who was playing. Yeah, she said... Philadelphia, right? The Flyers? No, the Flyers is hockey... whatever, come on over.\n\nI thought the worst thing might be I'd be explaining football rules to people who know nothing about the game, but whatever.\n\nThey came over an hour before kickoff, and the kids ran to the theatre while I said the hellos upstairs. By the time I came back down to watch the pre-game show, they were on the PS5 playing... and asked what movie we'd be watching.\n\nWhich led me going upstairs and discussing with the parents -- wtf is going on here? As it turns out, the parents thought they could come over and of course I'd hand over the theatre... and said so to their kids. And my wife's not even here. After all, I just want to watch the game alone; why not watch upstairs in the living room? It's a nice big TV.\u00a0\n\nYeah, no... if you want to watch a movie, go right ahead... the living room is indeed available, but the theatre is the Super Bowl.\n\nWhich led to a stupid argument, me being called an AH, crying kids. I think they've left but I'm not sure. I am downstairs, alone, and I don't care, but I am pissed off that this mood is kind of ruined. KC just won the coin toss, this is about to begin, and I'm thinking about this bullshit instead of the game. I texted and left a message to my wife explaining what happened but have not heard back yet.\n\nOK, first down Flyers! That's it for now.... but feel free to explain to me who I might be the AH in this scenario. I sincerely don't think so.\n\nPOST GAME EDIT: Thank you all for responding, overwhelmingly agreeing with what I thought. That's validating. A few on you touched on a point that's not irrelevant, and good food for thought... which is that they knew my wife would be away, and I don't think they'd have tried to pull this stunt if she'd been home... alluding to point that these people are using me, or at least trying to. I have to reflect on the fact that there's some truth to that, and that's for a whole other post. I have been very open and generous with this theatre, perhaps too much.", "created_utc": 1676246801, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110ub19/aita_for_wanting_to_watch_the_super_bowl_in_my/", "score": 2451, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But indeed, I could watch the game upstairs and leave them the theatre. Potentially making me an AH.\n\nOn the flip side, this is my house and my hard-earned theatre and I made it clear I'd be watching the game and anyone else is welcome to join me. Them appearing as if that's what they're going to do and then commandeering the situation and using their kids as pawns... well, it makes them AHs and not me. Why should I cave?

My news comes from 10-15 minutes of NPR through the Alexa app 1-3 times per day, which means I primarily hear just the top global stories. Those are the earthquake in Turkey and Syria, the different flying objects the US has shot down, and the classified documents at Trump/Biden/Pence homes. Updates on those stories are first whenever I listen to the news.", "I have no idea at all but I don't live in the US.", "Hmm, I think you're the one that needs to reread OP''s story. The ones that came over are OP's SIL and BIL. His wife's brother and wife and their kids. The SIL claimed to want to watch the super bowl WITH him. When in fact they came over, kids started up the gaming console and asked what movie they were going to watch. SIL and BIL had thrown OP under the bus by telling their kids they were there to watch a movie and assuming OP would bend to the pressure and just go watch the super bowl upstairs while they enjoyed HIS home theatre. Super entitled behaviour on their part (not including the kids). Really hope OP starts banning people that would use him like this. :) kudos to your wife, she sounds awesome!!", "He admitted that he held on ESPN!", "The refs took him into the locker room and made him a deal he couldn't refuse.\n\nNah, I saw that this morning. Still salty, but good on him for owning it."]}
