I hadn\u2019t even considered having his daughter be in my wedding party. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like her, she\u2019s an incredibly sweet and caring girl and I truly love her to bits, but I have a lot of friends, and it was already hard to narrow down who I wanted to be in this wedding party with me and I don\u2019t really want to have to kick out another friend for his daughter. \n\nWhen I told him this, he got really upset saying it\u2019s not fair that his son gets to be in the wedding party and his daughter doesn\u2019t, but I truly don\u2019t see that as my problem because he\u2019s the one including his son in the wedding party. I told him his daughter could be the flower girl as I do want her included, but he said she\u2019ll be too old for that by then which I don\u2019t get because she\u2019d only be 10, maybe that is too old I\u2019m not sure. \n\nNow he\u2019s kind of giving me the cold shoulder and talking about how I don\u2019t care about his kids, which is truly not the case, I just don\u2019t want her to be a bridesmaid! I want it to be people I\u2019ve been friends with my entire life. \n\nDoes that make me an asshole?\n\nEdit: I feel like a lot of you are missing the part where I said I DO want her to be included in the wedding. I just don\u2019t think a 10 year old girl will want to stand up in front of everyone for the duration of the ceremony. I know at 10 I wouldn\u2019t want to do that but I\u2019d still love to be involved somehow.

Your fiance doesn't expect her to go to the Bachelorette or plan a shower or something. Just wear a cute dress, walk down the aisle with her brother, holding a bouquet, feel special getting her hair and make up done. Don't think of it as replacing someone, basically just a match for her brother.\n\n\n\nYou could also suggest she be a groomswoman. Stand on Dad's side. I still highly suggest having her get hair and make up done with you, though. That sounds so special for a 10 year old girl. Whether she's a bridesmaid, groomswoman, or not.", "10 is a little old for flower girl, but the perfect age for a jr. bridesmaid role. She gets a fancy dress and gets to walk down the aisle. You don't have to kick anyone out. Hubby can have another groomsman if things look lopsided. YTA if you don't come up with some role for your future stepchild.", "YTA - if you don't want to include her as a Jr bridesmaid or some job made up to include her, you're not ready to be a stepmother. I'm a stepmother, my stepson- who I later adopted- was a groomsman & my favorite wedding pic is of the 3 of us.  If you can't figure it out, find someone without kids", "YTA. She can be a Jr bridesmaid and then she won\u2019t mess up your numbers. You need to start this marriage off right with these kids if you are gonna be their stepmother.", "The thing about bridesmaids is the friends you have now who've been there for you for years may not be around so much in the future. People change. They move away.  They get married themselves and focus more on their own family. They try to make partner in their law firm and don't have time for much else. They may still be in your life, just not as much. \n\nYou know who will be around ?  Your husband and his children. \n\nYou don't have to cut anyone to add a junior bridesmaid. \n\nYTA if you don't include her.

You don't think she's not going to notice she's not apart of the wedding like her brother?  Why don't you want her in your wedding party?

A while back there was a post from the guy's perspective and he wanted his daughter in the wedding (bridesmaid or maid of honor iirc). He was being really pushy about it. Everyone said he was the AH because he could make his daughter his \"best man\". It hadn't even occurred to him. \n\nNTA if he wants the daughter in the wedding she can be on the groom's side or be an older flower girl.", "Jesus it\u2019s not that hard: junior bridesmaid.

She looks like her mom, your potential husband\u2019s ex, and you don\u2019t want her getting any extra attention.", "YTA only because you\u2019re making entirely too big a deal out of this- you don\u2019t need to kick anyone out to add her. just have her and her brother walk down first together lol it\u2019s not like she\u2019s gonna come to the bachelorette party. when you marry someone with kids you\u2019re marrying the entire family and not including her would probably hugely damage your relationship", "How many bridesmaids and groomsman are you each having? Also, I\u2019ve been to many weddings where men and women were mixed amongst my the wedding party so I don\u2019t see why his daughter can\u2019t be beside him as well as his son and it still be fine. Do you have any men that could be in your party to?\nIt\u2019s about having your main supports beside you so their gender isn\u2019t important but their relationship and support system to you is.\n\nEdit: Before he said his son was going to be in his wedding party he should have first asked if you were cool with having his daughter in yours.

It\u2019s crazy to me that you wouldn\u2019t think they should both be in the wedding party.", "NTA. 10 is way to young for a proper bridesmaid. She could be a junior bridesmaid or a flower girl to match her brother, even if she's a little old for the role. I highly doubt anyone would see a brother and sister walking down the aisle together and think it's inappropriate. Far more inappropriate for a grown man to be walking down the aisle with a 10 year old! Whenever I've seen weddings with junior bridesmaids, they'd either walk with a junior groomsman who is close to their age or on their own.", "ESH. Your fianc\u00e9 should have talked to you about involving the kids in the wedding. He has his heart set on having his son as a groomsmen with little consideration for his daughter. However, it sounds like you\u2019re being a tad inflexible and more focused on the wedding versus your relationship with your fianc\u00e9\u2019s daughter. Yeah, they\u2019re his kids, but you\u2019re in a parental role and should consider the impact this would have on the daughter. \n\nIMO try to compromise on their roles so the kids are involved but not necessarily in the wedding party", "YTA.  Are you serious?  Sometimes I wonder if I\u2019m the idiot.", "You are entitled to have whoever you want in your bridal party. So NTA. \n\nBUT, consider how this will impact your rltp with her going forward. Excluding her from the wedding party when her brother has a place is \u2026\u2026.. tough. You aren\u2019t just marrying the man, but his kids too. Whether you make her an honorary bridesmaid, or find some other role for her to be involved, I\u2019d suggest trying to include her.", "NTA\n\nThose kids are too young to be groomsmen or bridesmaids. Ring bearer or flower girl type roles are available so they can participate, but putting little children in more serious roles is just insane.", "They both standup on his side then and you add a friend. Or you don\u2019t worry about pairing a 10 yo and have uneven numbers. So many solutions here that you\u2019re ignoring. YTA for valuing pageantry in your wedding show over your future children.", "Might be an unpopular opinion but going with NTA - you can choose whomever you want as a bridesmaid BUT I would consider including your fianc\u00e9s children in one form or the other in the wedding - you may consider just dressing her the same / similar to the bridesmaid. I assume that no one expects her to actually be a bridesmaid with bridesmaid \"duties\" (think being involved in the planning, throwing and taking part in a bachelorette party etc.) which might not be child-appropriate.  If on the day of being a flower girl is not possible, what about her being the ring bearer or have her play a part in the wedding, e.g., by reading a poem or a verse (if you are having a religious wedding).", "Soft YTA. Your wedding is just one day while you are going to spend the rest of your life with these three people. Not to mention that you and your fianc\u00e9 are going to have to learn how to resolve issues together for the rest of your lives so this is a good place to start. I moved my wedding three states away so my fianc\u00e9s grandmother could attend the wedding. I do think that other roles need to be found for the children but a wedding is about bringing families together. It may be sappy but it\u2019s just my view.", "YTA in my opinion. Those are your kids, too. They are your step kids. This is important to your fianc\u00e9 and to your step kids, but that doesn\u2019t seem to matter to you\u2026. \nIt really shouldn\u2019t even be that huge of an issue. I truly don\u2019t understand women who act like this.", "YTA. Find a compromise! For example, she could stand on the groom\u2019s side with her brother. Let\u2019s normalize mixed gendered bridal parties!", "Immediately NTA. Coming from someone also planning a wedding, it is YOUR choice who you have in your party. Just like it is HIS choice to have his son in his party. Personally, I've always found it odd to have children be apart of the wedding party. I was in a wedding where the groom had his 8 year old brother as a groomsmen and it was incredibly frustrating because he didn't even want to stand in line let alone anything else. \n\nAs far as the flower girl situation, I feel like the stigma around a flower girl having to be a young girl has sort of died out. The flower person can be anyone, guy, girl, grown, young, whatever. I attended a wedding where the bride's brother was the flower boy and he put on a little show. Super fun time. \n\nAll in all, if I've learned anything from planning my own wedding, do what makes you happy. And if your fianc\u00e9 can't understand your decision, then don't marry him. Saying you don't care about his kids over this seems a bit controlling anyway.", "YTA. How ridiculous that you think that you\u2019d have to \u201cfire\u201d a bridesmaid for your stepdaughter to be involved. That seems like just a tacky excuse. \n\nIt would be an amazing gesture of inclusion for your blended family to have the kids be part of the wedding party, so they can feel as if the are also being joined with you and as a family. Heck, maybe you should even do a sand Unity ceremony or something too.", "YTA! Shame on you for not wanting to include her. \n\nI hope he dumps you.", "NTA but if she is sweet and you love her to bits why not have her be a junior bridesmaid?   You shouldn\u2019t have to kick out another friend.   Other alternatives?   She can read a poem, or you can put the rings in two separate boxes and have each kid bring up a box.   My stepson was the ring bearer in our wedding, he was almost 8 at the time.", "[removed]", "NTA. He gets to fill \\*his\\* side of the wedding party, not yours. He can put his daughter in a suit and include her on his side; anything her 5-yr-old brother can take part in should be fine for her as well.", "NTA - it's difficult including and incorporating someone else's kids into your life, but that doesn't mean they need to always be the center of your life. Not wanting her in your bridal party doesn't mean you don't care, what women grows up thinking \"oh yeah I've always wanted to get married with my future husbands kid from his last marriage by my side.\" That's mean, but it's just kinda the case. \n\nYou're not making an unreasonable request. What is unreasonable and red flag-like is him immediately hijacking the wedding that's supposed to be about you two and using the kids to get what he wants.", "YTA- He's right,  your soon-to-be stepdaughter should be offered a defined role since your soon-to-be stepson will be standing up with his dad.\n\nTen is a little old for flower girl but plenty old enough to be a junior bridesmaid. You don't have to eliminate one of your adult bridesmaids,  there's no law that says you have to have the same number of bridesmaids and groomsmen . If you are really hung up on the symmetry,  have him add a groomsman. \n\n>I want it to be people I\u2019ve been friends with my entire life. \n\nIsn't a wedding about creating and honoring new lifelong ties? You're not just marrying the man, you're becoming a family and both children,  within their wishes and abilities,  should be included in that.", "YTA. Junior bridesmaid. She needs to be included. Not just because her brother is but because children need to be included in events like this. \n\nThis is not getting your relationship off to a good start.", "I was a Jr. Bridesmaid at my sister's first wedding. Let me tell you that you can see me picking my wedgie constantly and itching because the tights were terrible. \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n\nI am going with NTA. But you can also have alternatives.", "INFO: You can't have your friends and your soon-to-be stepdaughter?", "NTA. It's understandable that he wants her to be included, but he can have her in his groom's party.", "NTA!! A 10 year old has NO place for the bridesmaid!! And a 7 year old has no place as a groomsmen!! Have the kids there standing and involved together as a total seperate capacity or have both not involved. \n\nIt\u2019s a wedding, no rules set in stone, you can do whatever you want. But I completely understand not clearing a whole \u201cbridesmaid\u201d role for your 10 year old step daughter when you\u2019re happy to have her involved in another capacity.", "NTA.\n\n\nYou don\u2019t have to have his daughter as your bridesmaid but most divorced people tend to have their children in their wedding so he must have thought it was a given lmao.\n\nAnyways I\u2019d see how have 1 child bridesmaid and then the rest adult would ruin the aesthetics so hold your ground.", "NTA. You get to pick your bridesmaid's without question. If he wants his son to be a groomsmen that's fine, but you're not required to make his daughter, especially at that age a bridesmaid. She should be a flower girl,and the son should be a ring bearer.", "YTA for calling it \"your\" wedding and not \"ours\". If you want any kind of relationship with your step children you'll find a way to include your fiance's daughter.", "NTA. I strongly recommend you each come up with a role for the kids that is NOT a groomsman/bridesmaid. Ideas include greeting guests and handing out programs, asking guests to sign the guest book, or even walking with you both down the aisle (and then going to their seats after). The possibilities are endless.\n\nWith a bit of thought you can give them a special role so that they know they are included.

Sure you guys can work this out together. Do agree with all the comments about including the daughter in the wedding party in some way though, there are heaps of roles that are age appropriate and meaningful. At about that age I desperately wanted to be included in the wedding of an aunt who wasn't having a large wedding party, and she put me in charge of holding her bouquet for her while she signed the certificate etc (looking back it was genius as I felt SO important and special but didn't also have to stand up in front of everyone the whole time).", "This is the move.
