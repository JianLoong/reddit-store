I had a friend over a few weeks ago - she asked if she could bring her puppy along and I said ok. Well, she also showed up with her older, larger, badly-behaved dog because he \"started crying when she left.\"  He terrified my unprepared cats, slobbered and shed all over my new sofa, and she was so worried about him we barely had time to talk.  In short -- it would have been better if I had just said \"no\" when she asked to bring the puppy!", "Likewise, we take our pets everywhere as well. And when we can't, we either won't attend, one of us will stay home, or we will hire a house sitter if we can find one in time. As a rule, we don't take our pets into someone else's house more for our dog's safety, so we either don't attend hosted indoor events or get a sitter if we want to incur the expense.\n\nOP is definitely NTA here as long as they accept that their friend will likely no longer visit them as a result.

I want positive experiences for my animals and their owners.", "Allergies,  fear of dogs,  simply not wanting a dog in my home? All legit reasons not to have a dog in my house.\n\nAs for true service dogs,  that is tricky,  but I simply would not invite them to my house.

I agree that I cannot keep my new place perfect forever, however, I've only lived there for a week. I put my life savings into it. I would be alright with them bringing their dog IF the dog couldn't be left alone at all and they made sure it behaves. But it would really pain me to see the dog chew on my new curtains while the owner doesn't even bat an eye (which actually happened at my old house with that friend, except that stuff was old).", "As someone with allergies to animals I would have to insist that either they leave the dog at home or they don't come, service animal or not.", "Yes, if you don\u2019t allow animals, you could ask if they would mind leaving their animal at home as private residences are not covered by ADA.  I would ask what service or task the animal provides to see if you would be comfortable with someone not having access to that level of task; obviously some aren\u2019t able to be done by humans like dogs that can detect low blood sugar, but there are other means like normal blood testing.  There two legal questions public accommodations can ask a service animal owner and every service animal owner should be prepared to answer these at all times.  One was the one I told you to ask above, what service or task the animal provides.  The other is if the animal is required for a disability.  Emotional support animals, there are emotional tasks that can qualify for ADA protection like an animal that is trained to respond and signal an anxiety attack, but purely a comfort animal are not service dogs and not afforded the same ADA protection as service dogs.  Simply not allowing them is fine, these people always seem to be the worst about throwing a fit if their animal is not allowed and they have no legally right to demand it in the first place.", "I'm sure you float around on velvet slippers and only ever touch any surface with the softest of gloves.\nSMH get over yourself, a dog isn't gonna ruin a living space.", "There may be a happy middle - make it clear to your friend that their dog is welcome, but they need to pay attention and actually intervene if something like that happens again.", "Sure, allergies you have something medical that you can base your request on.\n\nBut if you just don't want dogs in your house, is it acceptable (in the AITA context) to just not invite a disabled person to your home that would otherwise be part of your social circle, solely based on the fact that you don't want their functionally necessary dog in your home?", "This is beyond delusional. Dogs have been known to chew through doors and destroyed furniture. \n\nAnd like\u2026 it\u2019s my house? Who should put wear and tear on my home if not me? You\u2019re very free with other poeple\u2019s money, which leads me to believe you\u2019re a minor who doesn\u2019t have to be responsible for things.", "Yes, it is YOUR house.", "Bro, I'm an adult who's been living with a dog for quite a while. I'm not sure what your frame of reference for dog behavior is but either it's exclusively based on dogs nobody ever trained or (and that feels more likely tbh), you're being deliberately argumentative to make some \"my house my rules I'd rather be alone and miserable than learn to communicate\" sort of point. \ud83e\udd37", "Sure, and it's my house and I can demand my disabled friend isn't allowed to bring their wheelchair. Doesn't make me any less of an asshole. This is AITA, not am I breaking the law. \n\nAnd the simple fact, unless you have a reasonable excuse like allergies or phobias, there is no moral reason to exclude a properly trained service animal that doesn't make you an asshole."]}
