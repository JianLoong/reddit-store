It was rather impromtu, having been put together only about a week or so in advance. Unfortunately, we decided to not include one of our close friends, Molly*, because of her severe bulimia/anorexia and the effects it\u2019s been having on her psyche. We all took a vacation together to Boston over fall break, where Molly was insufferable and neurotic the entire time. She flipped out whenever her food rituals and routines were disrupted\u2014for example, when my friend accidentally ate her protein bar for breakfast, forcing her to eat the hotel breakfast. She obsessed over the menus of restaurants we went to and, in one case, demanded we not go to one steakhouse we planned on going to for reasons she didn\u2019t explain. She almost had a crying meltdown at the restaurant we did go to instead, an upscale seafood place, because there was butter on the broccoli she requested to not be buttered. We could see her urgently entering calorie counts throughout each night. She seemed panicked whenever we talked about trying new foods in Boston, like lobster rolls. Plus, she would always spend forever in the bathroom purging after every meal. We found residue of vomit in the hotels sinks and toilet. \n\nIt isn\u2019t just the food, however. Molly was snappy and miserable almost the entire trip. She screamed at us and got mean over minor issues, her mood swings were horrible, and got irritated whenever we deviated from the itinerary. \n\nSo, we left her out of this and were much happier. We still all feel horrible and guilty for excluding Molly. She\u2019s one of our close friends, and we\u2019ve all known her since we were 14. She was fun-loving, spontaneous, and easy going pre ED. We\u2019ve encouraged, practically begged her to get help, but she refuses to be \u201cinstitutionalized\u201d. \n\nAre we the AH for leaving her out when she might need us most?", "created_utc": 1672893563, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/103pp4j/aita_for_leaving_our_friend_out_of_a_vacation/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm speaking as someone who has/had bulimia and was hospitalized for it. Molly is a grown woman and no one can force her to get help for herself. If she DID get help, however, she'd learn that one of the lesser-known side effects of ED is that it affects relationships, often by causing the sufferer to push others away. You aren't excluding her because you judge her for her ED. I imagine it's incredibly painful to watch a lifelong friend succumb to a deadly illness.", "I feel horrible for Molly, but it\u2019s not your fault. NTA. Her disorder has clearly reached a point where neither she, nor all of you, are able to enjoy yourselves. \n\nShe needs help, big time, but sadly you can\u2019t help someone who does not want it. It sucks, but you can\u2019t be there for everyone. I think putting some distance between her is best for now.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't leaving her out because she has an eating disorder. You are leaving her out because of her behavior on the previous trip. She won't get help and she can't manage her illness, you don't need to sacrifice your vacation to support her.", "NTA. She\u2019s pushing her problems on to you and by not going along with it, you\u2019re no longer enabling her. What she needs is serious psychological help. That is something neither you nor your friends can\u2019t provide her, so there\u2019s no reason to be dragged down with her.", "NTA.  Needing you most doesn't include every waking moment.  Everyone deserves a vacation and a person who doesn't fit in shouldn't be included.  Allowing her to join in and ruin the group activities may even be reinforcing her illness.  Guilt is for when you've done something wrong.  You haven't done anything wrong.  Best wishes. :-)", "NTA people shouldn\u2019t push their problems onto other people. But coming from someone whose suffered from an ED & acted pre irrational to my friends cus of it, you could sit her down & explain why you guys didn\u2019t invite her. If it was me, I\u2019d be pretty upset if I found out everyone went on vacation tgt through social media. If she\u2019s reasonable, I think she\u2019ll understand. Hope she gets the help she needs.", "NTA, she needs to get help", "NTA It's not your fault that Molly has anorexia. You guys can invite whoever you guys want.", "NTA. You set boundaries, she cannot neglect her mental health and expect people to deal with her severe issues. Honestly the constant puking alone would be enough for me to not travel with her until that was addressed.", "NTA.\nYou are leaving her out this time not exactly for her ED, but for her attitude in their previous trip. But you can try to help her with her health. Sadly it's hard when the person doesn't want any help, but you can try so in the future you can go together without problems", "NTA, I hope she gets the help she needs.", "NTA: It\u2019s sad you\u2019ve had to leave your close friend out, but it doesn\u2019t look like including her would have helped her. \n\nAt this stage, I don\u2019t think anything you, or her family can do, will help. She needs professional care. I just hope you all stay friends and your friendship can go back to normal once she\u2019s back to her old self again.", "NTA. She sounds very sick and maybe seeing that her illness is having an effect on her relationships will help move her towards getting treatment.", "NTA. Molly needs help and refuses to get help. You are friends, not therapists. As harsh as it may sound nobody else\u2019s mental illness is your burden to bear, especially when they refuse to do anything to improve their circumstances and dish out abuse to the people around them. \n\nThat is a one way road to ending up alone and miserable.", "NTA but this girl seriously needs help, is there anyone yall can reach out to for her? I know she doesn't want to be committed but her ED sounds severe and is only going to get worse from here. I suggest reaching out to maybe a social worker or see if your area has any local resources and talk to someone about forcing her to get help, this is serious and with how unstable she sounds right now she very well could attempt.", "NTA\n\nMolly doesn\u2019t sound like somebody I\u2019d want to vacation with either.", "NTA (s) \n\nIt sounds like you all really care about Molly, you've tried talking with her and she is refusing help. Sadly you girls can't fix her. She has to accept that she needs the help.  \n\nHonestly maybe seeing that she was left out - because of her BEHAVIOR- will help her see that she needs help.  \n\nDon't let feeling guilty stop you from being her friend, continue to be there in her life, and if she confronts you about this tell her the truth - that you'd all have loved for her to be with you but the last trip SHE was so unhappy and anxious it affected everybody.  She has a very serious disease and needs help, you all don't know how to help her, she needs professional counseling.", "NTA. Chick needs a therapist", "NTAs. It\u2019s a mental health issue and has she\u2019s over 18, no one can force her to get help. You\u2019ve all tried your best to help Molly get help, but she refuses to see the issue. You and your friends are entitled to have a relaxing vacation without worrying about offending her or walking on eggshells for fear she\u2019s implode. I have PTSD/anxiety/depression and it took me forever to get/accept help. My therapist told me \u201cyou can lead a horse to water but you can\u2019t force them to drink\u201d. I truly hope Molly realizes that she needs help before it\u2019s too late.", "NTA. Her bones should be gaining density right now not losing it. It\u2019s a sad situation but it\u2019s a vacation not you managing a difficult mental illness.", "NTA, vacations are supposed to be fun and break from reality and it sounds like having Molly vacation with you all is too stressful and thats something many of us would understand. \nI am curious though, does her family know about her eating disorder? Have they tried to help? It might not be a bad idea to talk with her family and see if you all can help her out. Also, did Molly know that she missed out on a vacation?", "Definitely NTA. You can\u2019t help someone who doesn\u2019t want it.", "You are so NTA.", "NTA, Including her will likely cause more harm than good for all of you. It sounds like she could barely function during your last vacation together, and I think that not including her is actually the responsible thing to do. She'd be damaging her relationship with you all, and risking her health (or life) by putting herself in this situation again.", "NTA. And if she finds out she was excluded, you can kindly explain to her how much you love her- and once she gets the help she needs you can\u2019t wait to go on a trip with her again. Continue to offer your love and support however you can.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for wanting a trip free from somebody treating you poorly and/or risking triggering your recovery. But I do think you\u2019ll be an AH if you don\u2019t have a real conversation with your friend about how her disorder is not only killing her but impacting your friendship. Realistically, nobody is entitled to an invite to anything ever - but she clearly is hurting, and spiraling, and if you do genuinely care about your relationship, honesty matters. I hope she gets the help she doesn\u2019t realize she needs. As you seem to intimately know \u2014 it\u2019s a journey.", "NTA the entire world doesn't have to cater to a medical problem.", "[deleted]", "NTA, but how does someone \u201caccidentally\u201d eat someone else\u2019s breakfast?", "Info: are you all just witnessing your friend suffer with a serious mental health issue and saying/doing nothing?", "Does anyone in your group actually even like her?  If the answer is,  \"yes\", then it's time for a group intervention. \n\nShe doesn't sound like much of a friend to any of you.   NTA", "You're NTA for wanting an enjoyable holiday, which it seems she's unable to contribute to at the moment. \n\nBut, how does one 'accidentally' eat a protein bar? Did your friend trip and fall mouth open onto it? Seems your friend ate something that didn't belong to her, knowing it belonged to someone with an issue with food routines etc, and that's not really kosher is it?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have no clue how they don\u2019t notice her behavior now that she\u2019s home tbh but they apparently dont. We are considering talking to her parents as the next step but this might be a bad idea because her mom has a long history of narcissism and ED-like behavior (think \u201ctwo almonds or a yogurt for a meal\u201d type mom)", "People with these kinds of issues need STRONG boundaries from friends and loved ones", "> She can take her miserable ass to the doctor to get herself help.\n\nI don't know how you intended that to sound, but it comes off as very insensitive.

That's a key part of the pathology. The child of a controlling, narcissistic mother develops purging behaviors in an attempt to regain control of that one small aspect of her life. The purging behavior can be understood as metaphorical. She's secretly purging her shame. This was the case for me.\n\nIs there anyone else in her life who might be able to talk her into getting treatment? Bulimia is deadly. One of the women I was hospitalized with died a couple years back due to bulimia complications. Molly desperately needs rehab.\n\nETA: It's especially concerning to me that she's not attempting to hide her ED behaviors from you guys. That definitely points to people in her life enabling or even encouraging her.", "I have a very good friend who has an eating disorder and she\u2018s had it since she was 14, she\u2018s 30 now and its still a struggle for her. Her parents were pretty clueless about it when she was a teenager. They were basically absentee parents, they worked all the time and really had no idea what was going on in her life if she didn\u2018t tell them directly but luckily she did talk to a school counselor who got her help. \nYou all are in college, right? I had also had a teammate who developed an eating disorder. She came to preseason with a very dramatic weight loss. It was so bad that we all noticed and we got our coach involved and the head of the athletic department so that she could get help. Basically, our coach and the head of the athletic department said she couldn\u2018t play until she was cleared by a doctor and our head trainer. She thankfully took the help she was offered. Basically what I am trying to say is if Molly\u2018s parents are wearing blinders, can you and your friends talk to Molly\u2018s advisor, a school counselor or anyone at school? If she won\u2018t listen to all of you, who have her best interest at heart, maybe she\u2018ll listen to someone with higher authority? It might be worth a shot, it worked for those that I know.", "[deleted]", "My bad. I did read the entire post but somehow forgot that bit.", "Coming from another person who's recovered from an eating disorder, NTA. Molly is probably being an asshole because she's hungry and feels sick all the time. I believe that is true because that's how I was at the worst of my bulemia/anoxeria. Maybe you can use this opportunity to ask Molly to seek help again. Let her know that normal dieting doesn't disrupt life like her eating disorder does and she needs to work on this before it kills alienates/kills her. I hope the best for Molly because having been there it's a tough place to admit you need help.", "I already thought you were NTA, but now doubly so. I also had severe anorexia when I was younger, but even now I wouldn\u2019t be able to be around someone actively engaging in ED behaviors like that without risk to myself.

We know like we\u2019ll break her trust by invol\u2019ing her and she\u2019ll despise us for a while but honestly we\u2019d rather that over her dying because we did nothing.", "A need for control is at the heart of anorexia's pathology. As OP said, pre-ED Molly was a laidback, easygoing woman. Anorexia has affected her personality. She isn't a controlling person, that's the grip of her ED. She definitely needs help, but she knows that she'll be forced to stop her ED behaviors if she goes to rehab. In her ill mind, it's better to push people away and continue to hurt herself than to seek treatment. She doesn't want help. ED is a terrifying mental illness. Assigning blame isn't helpful, but her friends are obviously under no obligation to invite her along knowing that she will continue to act on symptoms.", "Her mother sounds like a very, *very* manipulative and abusive asshole, to encourage their own child to live like this. \n\nYou may have to look into the involuntary commitment laws in your state. That would be a good start because she is getting worse, and she\u2019s incapable of making this decision for herself. I wouldn\u2019t go through her mom. Another loved one may have to admit her. Her mother is likely not going to do it because it\u2019s very apparent she is a narcissist and doesn\u2019t care.", "[deleted]", "Her mother, like most mothers of bulimics, is apparently highly narcissistic and actively encourages her daughter's disordered eating behaviors."]}
