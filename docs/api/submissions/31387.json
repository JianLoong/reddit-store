We all drove down together in George\u2019s car. \n\nOn the way down, I noticed that George was hitting a weed pen while he was driving. This was making me feel incredibly anxious and unsafe so I asked if he could please stop\u2026I was told that \u201che is driving fine\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s not that big of a deal\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s not strong\u201d but they couldn\u2019t even tell me the strain or percentage of what he was smoking. We were already about 10 hours into our drive when I noticed this was going on, so I was stuck in this situation that I was extremely uncomfortable with which didn\u2019t seem fair. \n\nAnother thing that was bothering me was the fact that they would keep the windows halfway open while we were going 80mph on the freeway. The sound and the wind blowing on my face really bothers me so I would ask them to roll the windows up and they would either ignore me or ask for a \u201clegitimate\u201d reason to roll them up. I started having my fiance ask instead because I felt they respected him more. But Carlos turned around and told me \u201cyou know, if you want to be a dick, be a dick yourself, don\u2019t make your boyfriend do it for you\u201d. \n\nI also expected that they wouldn\u2019t talk in a disgusting way in front of me. Just one example of something I was really uncomfortable with was them talking about how messed up and disgusting women\u2019s v****** are if they ride horses. When I expressed my discomfort they just told me that is how guys talked and if I wanted to be on the \u201cguys trip\u201d I had to not be so controlling and just deal with it.\n\nLastly, on the way home I got sick and my head and ears hurt. They were blasting a podcast and I asked them to please turn it off for a while. They refused to and it got to the point where I was holding my ears and literally crying in the backseat. I took some medicine but I just needed like 30 mins of quiet before it kicked in and instead I was told I would need to figure out how to deal with it because they would not be driving in silence. \n\nOverall I felt like my requests were pretty reasonable but they said I was trying to police them too much and being a dick. AITA?\n\nEDIT (clarity): this was a trip that my fianc\u00e9 and I planned our part together and the other guys planned their part together but we ended up carpooling to save money on gas. The original idea was that we would spend some time with them but mostly do our own thing. We hang out as a group almost every weekend and usually don\u2019t have any issues.
