We've always argued. Over time I too realised the best thing to do is be distant and tell her the bare minimum and get out of there when she starts preaching at me or spoiling for a fight. I think with some parents of her generation (I'm a few years older than you) they get married and have kids so young that they aren't really emotionally mature yet and then accordingly they lash out at the children, and never grow out of it as you grow up as they feel some entitlement to do that as they gave birth to you. Almost like ownership. There's not really that much you can do other than keep your distance and your boundaries like you are doing, and hope that one day she will sort herself out.

In high control groups, members\u2019 allegiance is supposed to be to the leader or leaders. Congratulations on getting out! I\u2019m so happy your ex was able to apologize to you! The etymology of \u2018gossip\u2019 is rad.
