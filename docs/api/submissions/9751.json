Congratulations on the life you have made for yourself in spite of having crappy parents. NTA.", "NTA. My mother is also very immature emotionally and criticised me my whole life. We've always argued. Over time I too realised the best thing to do is be distant and tell her the bare minimum and get out of there when she starts preaching at me or spoiling for a fight. I think with some parents of her generation (I'm a few years older than you) they get married and have kids so young that they aren't really emotionally mature yet and then accordingly they lash out at the children, and never grow out of it as you grow up as they feel some entitlement to do that as they gave birth to you. Almost like ownership. There's not really that much you can do other than keep your distance and your boundaries like you are doing, and hope that one day she will sort herself out. Hope but I wouldn't put money on it.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou mother, who all but forced you into an abusive marriage to an older man at a very young age is upset because you walk away in the face of her derision.\n\nFrom where I sit, the only criticism that you could possible deserve would be that you should have sprinted.\n\nAs for what you said, you get to say whatever you like to her, in whatever tone of voice works for you.  What you said to her was a truthful cri de coeur.

In high control groups, members\u2019 allegiance is supposed to be to the leader or leaders. Congratulations on getting out! I\u2019m so happy your ex was able to apologize to you! The etymology of \u2018gossip\u2019 is rad. It\u2019s original meaning \u2018a good friend.\u2019 Actual friends are more powerful than high control groups, and the life you\u2019re living proves that.

She is one of the people that put you through what you went through.\n\nShe went right along with everything, she should have been a parent and stopped what happened.\n\nInstead she signed off on an abusive relationship, threatened you with violence, and emotional abuse.\n\nThe fact that she hasn\u2019t apologised and made herself out to be a victim, shows just how little she cares about what happened to you.", "NTA", "NTA.

How dare she make such comments to you.", "NTA. Your mom is not being a mom, in that she either doesn't know how, or doesn't care to, listen to you. And listening to our kids, no matter their age (our daughter is 32) is part of what it means to be a parent.  So yeah, you blew up at her, but you did so under serious provocation given the history you describe.\n\nThe sad fact is that she just may not be able as a person to give you what you need in the relationship. In which case it may be best to take a long term break from her to avoid the frustration and pain. Good luck.", "The mother was a young woman and then a young mother who was part of what became a misogynistic cult. I'm sure she went through, at the very minimum, years of religious, verbal, psychological, and emotional abuse. Sexual abuse is also very common in these situation. None of that excuses not being a parent to her daughter or protecting her daughter from this shit. But there's a reason why we call cult victims, victims. Cults are abusive and predatory and target the vulnerable. People within cults can often start as victims and become abusers too. It's extremely complex. The mom can still have gone through a lot of abuse even if she also contributed to the abuse of her daughter. And she can have gone through a lot of abuse without that EXCUSING the abuse of her daughter.", "NTA I was also raised in a cult religion where women were blamed for being beaten by their husbands (You're not subservient enough) and women were blamed if their husbands molested their children (You're not putting out enough).\n\nIt's hard to create boundaries when you didn't even know they were supposed to exist. I've found myself going from 0 to 100, not knowing that I could have said something at 50.\n\nThese cult parents sacrifice their children (*literally* in the case of JWs) so as to look better to their fellow cult members.\n\nI would have only added to your parting comment, \"Yes, I walk away because I have boundaries that you always cross. It's called self-preservation from the abuse you dish out and expect me to eat.\"", "NTA\n\nPeople teach you how to treat them. It's not abnormal that a daughter would refuse to let their self centered parent abuse them.\n\nShe also sounds like a textbook case of DARVO. DARVO stands for \"Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender. The perpetrator or offender may Deny the behavior, Attack the individual doing the confronting, and Reverse the roles of victim and offender such that the perpetrator assumes the victim role and turns the true victim into the offender.\n\nMaking you be the parent sounds like possible parentification.\n\nA normal parent would talk to their adult child with basic respect. Your mother doesn't. She consciously chooses her feelings over yours. She sounds like she's done it many times. So, she's consciously choosing to be cruel.\n\nYour mother clearly doesn't deserve you.", "NTA. Not all people were meant to be parents.", "NTA\u2014 I think you\u2019re right \u201chere\u2019s how I healed from the situation you put me in\u201d is something a mother should want to hear. If a friend said \u201cyou never asked me about what I went through,\u201d then fair enough, but yeah, the parent shouldn\u2019t expect the child to give them emotional support for decisions that impacted the child, regardless of the age. \nI mean, when my dad wants to talk about current things and I listen to him like a friend, that\u2019s fine, but this was about trauma you went through because of her\u2014 you\u2019re not peers in regards to that situation. She did need to put on her mom hat and a mother\u2019s love should make her push through her own discomfort with the topic to support you.", "Don't waste your time with the. Go NC. She doesnt love you or cares about you. At this point you already have your life.. Why bother with her?
