She had it before but decided to push the issue in public, and you had had enough. She embarrassed herself by asking AGAIN in front of everyone at the party. NTA", "NTA. If you don't feel comfortable, you don't feel comfortable. Does your mom know about what you know? And all the people at the party obviously do not know what is going on, so they have no say in your decision.\n\nYou might even need to talk to the police?", "Mom picking bf over her children is toxic AF. \n\nCut her out of your life and don't look back. Lifes too short to put up with that kind of ish.\n\nNTA", "You're leaving out something REALLY important here.\n\n> I recently found out some stuff about my mom, mom\u2019s boyfriend and my brother\n\nMost adults who read what you wrote here will likely assume that there was some kind of abuse going on.  Since your sister left 1 year after boyfriend arrived, and your brother descended into drug use, we are going to assume it was sexual in nature.  \n\nIf it's not an abusive situation, you should be more clear.  If it is, never go back to any building that has that man in it ever in your life.", "NTA\n\nYes, your mother DID do something to you. She chose her BF even when he did something bad to your brother.\n\nShe wants you back so she can feel better about what she did, like your going there means she's not a bad person. But anyone who chooses a BF over her minor child, for years on end, is an AH.\n\nIt's easy for your dad to say you shouldn't have said what you did, but your mom was pressuring you over and over and would not take no for an answer. She even said she'd \"*always pick her BF*\". She is an adult, and should not have said that.\n\nThat you responded the way you did is **on her** for provoking her own child, not on you as her teenage (minor) child.", "NTA \n\nAt 17 you\u2019re old enough to choose for yourself which parent you want to live with. That your mom said she would always pick her boyfriend over her own children says a lot about her failures as a mother. \n\nI\u2019m a little concerned about you finding out \u201csome stuff\u201d about your mom and her boyfriend and your brother that lead to you moving out. What does that mean? Was there some kind of abuse? I hope your dad/a trusted adult is aware of whatever happened and able to help you both through it\n\nI think with all the drama going on it might be good for you to have a space where you can talk about everything. Maybe talk to your dad about going to see a therapist", "NTA. She specifically said she will always pick her bf over her kids. Pretty shitty parenting. My brain is going crazy with all the possibilities it's conjured up with regards to her her bf and your brother. You are not obligated to have anyone in your life that you don't want to. 'family' is a bullshit excuse. Keep the dysfunction as far away as you can.", "NTA. She said she will always pick her bf over her kids. Why would you pick her then? And how can anyone think you\u2019re TA? Cut all of those people off including her.", "NTA. If she knows her boyfriend abused your sister and brother, and she still picks him over her own kids, she is a horrible mother and you'll be right to limit contact.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your mom asked you at a family party thinking the pressure of having witnesses around would make you uncomfortable enough to just break down and say yes. The cherry on top is saying she will always pick her boyfriend first, especially if there\u2019s some ugly history like you mentioned. Don\u2019t listen to those telling you that you did something wrong. You don\u2019t have to make yourself stay anywhere that is uncomfortable or unsafe, family or not. You have every right to boundaries to keep yourself safe. I hope you\u2019ll also consider going to therapy to help you cope with your feelings and the stress this situation can cause you.", "NTA.

You did right", "You let your mom know how you feel and she made her choice. NTA. My mom wanted to get back with her ex husband after my brother and I went through some really awful things because of him.

My brother doesn\u2019t want him to know. He says he\u2019s not ready. I tried to get him to tell him but he won\u2019t.", "Please talk to a trusted adult, whether it be your dad or someone else. I know you feel you have no right to break your brother\u2019s wishes or trust, but when abuse is in the equation, safety is the top priority, both yours and your brother. He may need help to get through and process this. Talk to an adult you can trust to help keep you and him safe!", "I\u2019m so sorry for what happened to your brother. And I\u2019m sorry you feel like you can\u2019t tell your dad.\n\nI know you want to keep your brothers secret but you would both benefit from telling your dad. You should both be in therapy to help you cope with this. Talk to your brother again, see where he\u2019s at regarding telling your dad. Stress to him that you need to tell someone, so that you can both get the help you need to start healing and keep you safe. \n\nTelling your dad or a trusted adult about what happened can help your brother and can also help you navigate the relationship with your mom going forward. Definitely stick to your guns here and don\u2019t stay overnight at her house. A person who can know a child, her child, is being abused and do nothing about it is evil."]}
