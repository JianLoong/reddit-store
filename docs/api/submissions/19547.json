{"id": 19547, "submission_id": "146whqu", "title": "AITA for moving closer to my long-distance bf without telling him?", "selftext": "I (21F) have been dating my boyfriend (21M) for almost 4 years now. We met in freshman year of college and started dating shortly after. He's from the west coast and I live on the east coast, so we've been doing long distance every summer.\n\nWe've now both just graduated. He's going to start his master's program in the fall at a school on the west coast, and I plan to start working very soon. Originally, I was planning to stay on the east coast and get a job close to my hometown, so that I can still be near my family and friends. Because of that, my bf and I had decided to continue long-distance until he's done with his master's program, and then figure out how to continue from there.\n\nHowever, I got offered a job on the west coast (close to where my bf is going to school) which I wasn't really expecting to get and therefore hadn't told my bf about. It's a job I'm really excited about and of course there's the bonus of being close to my bf. So after contemplating for a bit I accepted the job offer and made all the arrangements to move there.\n\nAbout a week ago, I told my bf about it, hoping to surprise him in a good way. But instead, he got upset. He said that by moving there I'd be depriving him of his space and that he didn't understand why I was doing this because we had agreed to do long-distance for the next couple of years.\n\nI admitted that I was sorry for not telling him earlier, but I had wanted it to be a surprise and I thought that he would be happy for me to be closer to him. But he kept calling me clingy and possessive and saying that by living close to him for the next couple of years, I would be depriving him of his space.\n\nHonestly, it really confused me. I don't think I'm being clingy or possessive at all. It's not like I'm asking to move in with him or anything- I'm going to have my own apartment. And it's about 30 minutes away from where he lives. If we didn't decide to meet up, we probably wouldn't even bump into each other at all. If he wants space, I can readily give him space. I just think it's nice to have the option of being able to see each other when we want.\n\nAnd I didn't understand why he was upset with me being closer. If you love someone, why wouldn't you want to be near them? I'm confused as to why he would prefer long-distance when living close to each other is an option. I started overthinking after this conversation and even suspected he might be cheating, but I really don't know what to think.\n\nIt's been almost a week since this conversation, and he has barely spoken to me since. He won't answer my texts or pick up my calls. I'm moving in a couple of weeks. I don't know what to do or what to think.\n\nAITA in this situation?", "created_utc": 1686496554, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146whqu/aita_for_moving_closer_to_my_longdistance_bf/", "score": 68, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He wants space from you.", "NTA I don't think he is that much into you, he could be having you as a backup.\n\nI would be incredibly happy if my partner moved closer to me back when I was in a LDR, his reaction is not normal, what more space do you need then 30 mins away from your partner?\n\nReally stange reaction, and the ghosting after is a massive red flag.", "NTA: You got a job offer and took it. If he wants his space, he doesn't need to see you\n\nAlso, listen to what he's saying; he doesn't seem that into you. It sounds like he likes having you in the background as a confidence boost or backup plan. If he doesn't want to be with you, it's better to learn now", "NTA I just hope you can be happy being there without your soon to be ex boyfriend.", "NTA, this is not clingy at all and his response is a big red flag. This is a good sign to prioritize yourself. You could certainly talk to him about it more, but I would really pay attention to his behavior. \n\nYou deserve to have a partner who is enthusiastic and invested in your relationship.", "NTA. Sounds to me like you are not actually his girlfriend. He\u2019s angry because it\u2019s going to be a lot harder to hide his real gf from you now.", "NTA. My jaw dropped when I read that he said he needed his space. Like, he literally needs the entire west coast?   What a jerk.  I agree with the other commenters, he\u2019s got other relationships he doesn\u2019t want you to know about and them to know about you.   Drop him, take the job, make new friends and find a better SO.", "NTA, unfortunately he most likely has a romantic life across the country that you don\u2019t know about, if he was really with you he would be happy about you being closer.

His actions are telling you he isn\u2019t nearly as invested in progressing this relationship as you are.\n\nReally rough way to find out, and I\u2019m so sorry for you for that. In the future, 100% not a good surprise. Have the conversation and know what depth the pool is before diving in.\n\nNTA exactly, just a little too trusting.", "NTA \n\nI honestly don\u2019t know why he\u2019s so upset- aside from the obvious outsider perspective things I\u2019d say without knowing either of you: he wants to break up, he\u2019s seeing someone else on the west coast, etc etc. but you don\u2019t seem suspicious of any of that at all, so I\u2019m going to assume you\u2019re confident that those are not the case. Which leaves me totally clueless. \n\nMaybe he just feels a little caught off guard? He had this plan in his head and now it\u2019s all different and feels like he should have been part of it? But calling you clingy and possessive is weird. You could have taken a job anywhere you wanted to take a job, and moved there. It happens that this is 30 minutes from where he\u2019ll be. \n\nI think you should take the job, and make your move. I think you should plan for how that will look for you if things don\u2019t work out with this bf (that\u2019s the reality- he\u2019s being weird and calling you clingy and possessive so just keep it in mind that you may end up walking away from him). But I think living on a new coast with your own thing going away from your hometown will be good regardless of the bf, even if you just do a couple of years  there and then decide you\u2019re a east coast kind of person. \n\nI\u2019m sorry he reacted the way he did. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA and I think it\u2019s over.

Red flag, if you ask me.", "NTA and to be honest your boyfriend kinda seems like an asshole. I did long distance for years and would have loved nothing more than to have been together earlier.", "NTA, and his reaction should be an entire fabric factory of red flags; odds are he's either been stringing you along with no interest in advancing the relationship, or he has a local girlfriend who thinks they're exclusive.", "NTA.

He doesn\u2019t want you near because it threatens that secret.  Take the job, dump the bf and completely start over with your life.  It won\u2019t be easy, but trust me, it\u2019s the best thing to do and you\u2019ll have a ton of fun meeting people along the way.  Good luck on your new adventure", "NTA but are you really not understanding why he is upset?  He\u2019s a jerk that\u2019s cheating on you.  Enjoy your great new job and live an awesome life.  Without that loser", "nta - just do the move and be excited for the new chapter in your life with your new job.  you probably will meet new and exciting ppl and you probably will out grow the bf.", "I'm so sorry to say this but he's probably still actively dating other people.", "If the job is good for you, move anyways. If he is acting sketchy over good news and then ghosting you, dump his ass.", "If you wouldn't take the job if it weren't for the bf, don't go. He doesn't want you there. \n\nIf it's a good job then take it.\n\nEither way, plan as though you don't have a bf", "Does anyone else get the feeling he has someone else on the west coast already? OP have you ever visited him or met his family there?", "NTA. Tbf, Id be a little surprised if my long distance SO suddenly sprung on me that they were moving across the country to my area in a couple weeks. I\u2019d definitely be taken aback and confused as to why you didn\u2019t tell me when you applied, much less before you accepted when you received the job offer.

Yes, you should\u2019ve told him before actually moving, only bc I feel he still would\u2019ve had this reaction and then you\u2019d truly be picking the job bc you want it and not to be near him. \n\nSomeone who WANTS to be with you would NOT react this way.

About a week ago, I told my bf about it\n\nYou said you didn't tell him about the interview because you didn't think you'd get it - but then you got an offer, accepted it, and made plans to move - all without telling him? You waited until it was a done deal before you said anything? That's pretty weird and I can't help wondering if you knew he would discourage you from moving, if it wasn\u2019t all settled.", "He's probably expecting to meet a lot of like- minded people while studying for his masters and would like to get to know them in case there's a better match than you.", "If keeping your current job on east coast is still an option, don't move. If possible, keep your original plan of staying near friends and family. Many men are not worth uprooting your whole life plan and starting a new one over. This relationship is over, if it ever was a relationship to begin with. He clearly states he doesn't want to live in your proximity. It doesn't matter if he is cheating or not. If you move, you will find yourself in a situation where you will feel like you have broken up. Your won't have your friends and family and a support system to help you through it. Having a tough life event like a break up or bereavement is especially harder in a new and strange city. Having said that, if you think that the job opportunity is too good to miss, by all means go for it. Move, but for your career and not this boy. Just text him, \"I am taking the job and moving your part of the country, but we are over.\"\n\nPeople who crave space when they are not living together are not worth our time and energy. As bitter that pill is to swallow, the fact is he is not into you. Leave him be and heal yourself. Focus on finding your passions, exploring your career, making friends and enjoying life in general. You may bump into someone who is worthy of you.", "YTA to yourself. Congrats for the new job, but take this as a lesson, that you shouldn't make such big changes for others you don't really know.", "YTA\nI had a bf hide from me that he had applied to and accepted going to the same college as me out of state back in high school. He told all our mutual friends and everyone kept it from me. I broke up with him before he even got a chance to tell me because I realized I didn\u2019t want to do long-distance. Then when he did tell me, I was pissed at the lying and lack of communication (spoiler: we never got back together even though we did end up at the same college). \n\nI think you should have told him the second you were planning this as an option, or the second you got the offer, definitely by the time you accepted the job, found a place to rent, did you even sign a lease without telling him? \n\nSo, I think you have to brace yourself for the fact that he might break up with you, in part probably because he was planning to beforehand and now also because of how you hid all this from him and broke his trust in a pretty significant way. Major life plans and decisions that impact your relationship are not a good \u201csurprise\u201d. You make the other person feel betrayed and even look stupid in front of family or friends that they\u2019ve been inadvertently lying to because of your dishonesty. \n\nYour bf is scrambling and his excuses are stupid, though, I\u2019ll admit that. I\u2019m guessing since he wasn\u2019t planning on this (rightfully so), he had other plans that did not include you or included breaking up with you first and is now freaking the fuck out that you\u2019ve made such a huge move without him getting a chance to tell you not to bother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
