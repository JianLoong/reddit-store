I asked why she didn\u2019t just plunge it and she said she refused because it would make the mess worse. I was like WTF and just plunged it for her. I called the neighbours back and they were thankfully really understanding.

You helped her by getting the toilet to stop overflowing. If you had not recieved the text was she just expecting you to know something was wrong and fix it? No she would have had to put her big girl panties on and come ask you for help if she couldn't fix it by herself. \nShe was lucky she didn't have to do that and the neighbours alerted you to the issue (how long had it been overflowing for it to go through the neighbours ceiling so badly because that seems a fair bit of time it had been going on for that to happen and she didn't ask already) and you came in and fixed the issue. She should have then been grown up enough to say would you be able to help me clean this up as I have work in the morning or would you be able to put the towels on to wash for me as I have work in the morning. It is on her and she is probably angry at herself for causing the issue. However she is completely wrong to take her anger at herself out on you. \nWhen she is in a better mood and had chance to calm down explain to her you have no issue helping but she has to be willing to ask you and not just expect you to help.

Mine still has no idea how to change the toilet paper roll, or she does and she just figures someone else will come along and do it next for her. There's zero reason your sister couldn't have asked for help politely either for stopping the overflow or cleaning up with her, or even just thanked you for helping to stop the issue she caused. She's got to grow up.", "based on this perspective, NTA of course. makes me a little curious if there is some underlying tension or some details left out from her perspective though. she comes across here as irrational, but in a way that makes me think there is at least a little more to her side that you perhaps aren't taking the time to understand? maybe of course idk. she could just be weird af", "NTA. She is though.", "NTA\n\nHere's hoping your sister doesn't grow up to be like my mother.\n\nPicture it. I live in FL. Mom rented an apartment in a building that had gone condo, in OH. These apartments had a shared water bill.\n\nDiscussing my imminent visit, she suddenly asked if I knew anything about plumbing. \"Enough to know when to make repairs myself and when to call a professional, why?\"\n\nHer master bathroom sink faucet had been leaking for months. The water bill was elevated and her landlord had asked several times if there was an issue in her unit. She had lied (no idea why) and he was threatening to inspect every unit in the building.\n\nJeez.\n\nSo, I had a look when I arrived. First, I showed her the shut off under the sink. She had no idea that there was one. She asked if I could fix it. \"I could, but this is literally the cheapo faucet from [that store that starts with W and ends with mart] with crappy plastic innards. I'll just replace it and it'll be like new.\"\n\nSo, next day she arrived home from work and I showed her that the shiny new cheapo faucet didn't leak. She thought that I must have worked on it all day. I told her that the swap out took less than 10 minutes including cleanup and asked what else needed to be done.\n\nMom took me into the spare room, showed me her air handler and a stack of those cheap blue air filters. The really cheap ones that I bet still are about $1. The woman has about 60, stacked neatly in the closet. \"Do you know how to put these in? My landlord drops themoff every few months and I don't know what to do with them.\"\n\nOkay, plumbing I can see not wanting to mess up, but WTF? I looked at her, looked at the giant stack of filters, looked at her again and then said. \"Mom? You are about to feel really silly. See this knob?\" Tapping the knob, \"Use it to lift the flap, reach in and pull that 5 year old filter out, then slide a new one in.\"\n\nMom: \"oh my god!\"\n\nHow did I grow up with no idea that my mother knew less than zero about super basic home maintenance? lol", "NTA obviously.\n\nMy advice is that tomorrow you tell her.\n\n\"Let me get this straight. You made a mistake. I helped you with it and then you got mad at me for not helping more. For something you did\"\n\nAnd then ask for her side of the situation.", "NTA. Your sister was / is being unreasonable and taking her anger out on you is wrong, just plain wrong. You may be used to it but you shouldn't be. \n\nYou deserve to be treated with common courtesy and basic respect, period. Your sister's behavior is unacceptable. You should move out, have less stress in your life, and let your sister learn her own lessons.", "She's an idiot.", "NTA, your sister isn\u2019t a child anymore. If she can clog the toilet with rubbish that *never* should be in there, she can clean up the mess. \n\nYou stepped in for both your sakes because damage to the neighbors\u2018 place could get expensive for both of you, but cleaning up her mess and doing her laundry for something she caused out of stupidity? Nope. And for her to expect you to do that even without being asked? Was she high?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Way to deflect fault, little sister. NTA.", "How much you want to bet this sister used to flush tampons thinking it's fine too?", "Wait, did she keep flushing? Wtf", "Can you plunger with the water off?", "Move somewhere else op without her", "It's  simple  :her mess =her responsibility.  Nta at all", "You can but the plunger works by pushing the air in the plunger down into the water and forcing it into the obstruction. If the water is off you might force the water past the obstruction without fully clearing it.\n\nIt can work with just air but it's pretty crappy."]}
