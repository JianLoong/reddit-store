The water bill was elevated and her landlord had asked several times if there was an issue in her unit. She had lied (no idea why) and he was threatening to inspect every unit in the building.\n\nJeez.\n\nSo, I had a look when I arrived. First, I showed her the shut off under the sink. She had no idea that there was one. She asked if I could fix it. \"I could, but this is literally the cheapo faucet from [that store that starts with W and ends with mart] with crappy plastic innards. I'll just replace it and it'll be like new.\"\n\nSo, next day she arrived home from work and I showed her that the shiny new cheapo faucet didn't leak. She thought that I must have worked on it all day. I told her that the swap out took less than 10 minutes including cleanup and asked what else needed to be done.\n\nMom took me into the spare room, showed me her air handler and a stack of those cheap blue air filters. The really cheap ones that I bet still are about $1. The woman has about 60, stacked neatly in the closet. \"Do you know how to put these in? My landlord drops themoff every few months and I don't know what to do with them.\"\n\nOkay, plumbing I can see not wanting to mess up, but WTF? I looked at her, looked at the giant stack of filters, looked at her again and then said. \"Mom? You are about to feel really silly. See this knob?\" Tapping the knob, \"Use it to lift the flap, reach in and pull that 5 year old filter out, then slide a new one in.\"\n\nMom: \"oh my god!\"\n\nHow did I grow up with no idea that my mother knew less than zero about super basic home maintenance? lol", "NTA obviously.\n\nMy advice is that tomorrow you tell her.\n\n\"Let me get this straight.

It was a complete and utter asshole move on my part to have immediately rushed into the bathroom in an attempt to salvage the problem upon receiving notification, instead of slowly...\n\n... briskly...\n\nwalking over.\n\nSure, I plunged the toilet to unclog the mess my sister created. Then phoned back my neighbors to let them know that the matter has been resolved. But I just so happen to conveniently allow the asshole in me to take over my faculties and left it up to my sister to clean up the mess she has created. My sister is the only one in this world with a steady job so surely I could have been thoughtful enough to clean up the mess on her behalf rather than washing up as it's approaching the dead of the night and we have a few hours sleep ahead of a busy day tomorrow. Of course I deserved the tongue lashing my sister gave me. She had to wake up at 6 a.m. tomorrow and she is stuck doing laundry as we approach the dead of the night. As the principal owner of the rest of the world and the one above all who borrows our time, how could I have been so inconsiderate and not realize by telepathy that she still needed help cleaning up after her even after I have gone the extra mile to repair the damage she's done? I am such an asshole.\"\n\nHad a good laugh at that? Now let's get to the nitty-gritty: If a narrative like the one above is what your sister conjures in attempt to convince you that you are the one at fault here, this certainly speaks volumes about her logic flow. In which case, the way she yearns to construct her own pattern of thought is NOT your responsibility to bear. To me, yourself, or any reasonably sound other, we all know this narrative reads like layer upon layer of absurdities. It's just unfortunate we couldn't get everybody to read it the same way. \n\nYour sister is way past the usual age of reason (I'd say 18-20). I knew what a plunger did at half her current age. I've got friends who studied overseas who will be kicked out by their dorm-mates if they exhibited a lack of responsibility like she did. Your sister is fresh out of excuses and that's when she needs to grow up. Don't know how something is done? Ask. Don't know if she is doing it right? Ask.
