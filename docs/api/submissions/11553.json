You sound a bit down on yourself because of your problems. Don\u2019t let him beat you down more. If his behavior has occurred before, please think of yourself and exit the relationship. You deserve better.", "Damn, your bf is an asshole. Your meltdown was not the cause of the argument; he was. He was rude and insulting to you and made you feel worse. His job as your bf is to support you and care for you. He should be making your life better simply for being in it, but this asshat is making your life worse. \n\nI suggest you apologise to your parents, ask to come home and leave him to his videogames. They are clearly more important to him than you are.  \nIf no one has told you yet, you don't need a man in your life to make you complete. He's not worth your time and effort, but you are. Prioritise yourself right now", "NTA. It was an accident, and his reaction is to freak out over a lava lamp? You should rethink your relationship if he\u2019s screaming over something that (imo) is not a big deal", "[deleted]", "NTA it was an accident but he reacted poorly and don't blame you for this at all.", "I think ESH. Should he have helped you move the lamp? Yes. Could you have waited until he was done with the game? Yes. It wasn't that time sensitive. You both suck because you both resorted to yelling and fuck you's immediately instead of talking through both of your perspectives and finding a common ground for next time.", "NTA. He sucks. \n\nTry to make amends with your mom and move back in with her.", "It\u2019s not that you shouldn\u2019t have to do anything and it\u2019s not that you\u2019re trying to evade chores or responsibilities. If he\u2019s accusing you of that then it\u2019s unfounded. He left you to do a specific task that you\u2019re not a good fit for, predictably it went wrong, and he needs to step up to that one thing with a good grace if he wants a good relationship with you. You\u2019re not to blame. He was immature and a bit selfish and lazy, understandable after a long difficult day, but not thinking it through when he left you to do it. He\u2019s being an AH.", "NTA\n\nBut this is something your boyfriend should have been able to help you with. If not immediately, then within a reasonable timeframe.\n\nHe knows about your condition and he knows that there are going to be things you can't always do. \n\nIf this is how he plans to treat you when those instances arise, then that's a sign I'd pay attention to.", "Please get out of this relationship \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your boyfriend should have moved the lava lamp himself. He surely knew there was a risk you would lose your balance and drop it, if you tried to move it. This was a foreseeable accident that he could have easily prevented by getting off his rear end and doing the task himself.\n\nIt sounds like you're headed for abuse, if you stay in this relationship. With your condition, you need someone who is kind and understanding, and who is willing to accommodate your limitations. You don't need someone who is going to yell and berate you for being clumsy all the time.", "NTA. He treated you appallingly for a simple accident.

You predicted this outcome and sure enough you were right.\n\n>So what should you just not have to do anything because you might fuck it up?\n\nNo, you were worried it wouldn't go smoothly and you were right. If anything, this should be a lesson for him to listen to you because you seem to know your own capacity. This doesn't mean you can't do anything, which isn't what you were saying. He sounds like a child who is used to having things done for him.", "OMG  I practically got triggered reading this.    He is a royal AH.     Please reconsider this relationship.   You are NTA and you deserve better!!", "I think you ARE the AH, but so is he.  Nobody forced you to moved the lamp; if you felt you weren\u2019t up to doing it you should not have even tried.", "Was his first reaction concern for your well-being? Checking if you got any cuts / if you fell / how you are feeling? Or was he livid right away?\nHas situations like these happened before where he is unnecessarily cruel with his words? If he\u2019s furious over a small mistake, how will he react when you make a bigger one (comes with being human, everybody does)? Is he worth having problems with your family? These are not rhetorical as we can\u2019t know the answer from a single, isolated incident but please ask these to yourself before moving forward with the relationship. You are worthy of love and having caring people around you. NTA", "NTA\n\nTwas an accident.

I know the mom kicked her out, but living with this guy doesn't sound like a good alternative.", "How is it self-indulgent to give context?", "i guess i read it as 'I'm an extra special person for whom there are extenuating circumstances' which, in the context of an AITA post, could be seen as self indulgent, bet we can disagree. Deleted now because i think it was too dismissive and probably not very sympathetic. I would add that i doubt i was the only person to think this and secondly I'm probably not the only person to think ' I wonder if she perhaps unconsciously deliberately broke the lamp to prove that she was right' Lots of 'poor me, poor me' vibes in this persons post."]}
