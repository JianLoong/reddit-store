Nope, he acted like an asshole. \n\nBut his reaction itself makes me question how you told this story. Here\u2019s the thing, that everyone seems to want to give a pass on\u2026.When things don\u2019t make sense, they are probably either lies, or out of the actual sequence that happened, or omissions.\n\nSo either your boyfriend is the biggest asshole I\u2019ve heard of in quite some time and we\u2019d need to be baffled at why you are there to begin with\u2026.. or\u2026..\n\nLikely omission and out of sequence: \n\nYou said he said \u201cdo it yourself\u201d, and then after that said he was playing a game. You insinuate he was just flat out refusing. You sure about this? Sure it wasn\u2019t just\u2026 I\u2019ll get to it later? \n\nHere\u2019s what makes more sense : you had a hissy fit because he wasn\u2019t going to stop playing  a game **right then** and do it, that\u2019s more likely, now isn\u2019t it?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make sense that if you knew right then was a particularly bad balance time for you, that you\u2019d pick right then to do it if he was flat out refusing, ever. What makes a lot more sense is you got pissed, wanted it done **right then**, and tried to do it yourself despite it being silly to do - because you were pissed or fixated or whatever the case.\n\nThe way you portrayed it just doesn\u2019t make sense. We don\u2019t in one second acknowledge we know we can\u2019t do it, then go do it RIGHT THEN.\n\nOut of sequence or omissions part two:\n\nYou then go on to say he threw a broom down **and after that** you \u201cbegged him to help while crying**. That doesn\u2019t make sense either. \n\nWhat\u2019s far more likely is you broke the thing, he likely did say something along the lines of WTF, then you started saying he had to help you clean up, and he got mad and said fuck that. Makes a ton more sense.\n\nThus, I really do think this is an ESH.", "NTA.

Your bf sucks for obvious reasons. You suck because I think you're leaving a lot out of the story. I have 3 lava lamps in my house and 4 cats. A typical Lava lamp is fairly heavy for its size and not something a cat would likely knock over intentionally or accidentally. Now, I suppose your lamp could have been sitting on the very edge of the shelf, making it more likely for your cat to knock it off if it jumped on the self or positioned itself on the shelf. Given your balance wasn't good on the day in question, the best response would have been for you to push the lamp to the back of the shelf until your bf was able to move it to a better location. Also, if I'm reading your story correctly, you moved the lamp as one piece, which is just asking for trouble. You should have moved the glass portion by itself as that way it would have been stable and impossible to topple over.

That\u2019s the definition of a disability.\n\nYou have likely told him  this before, you reminded him and he couldn\u2019t be arsed to stand up and do it himself. I understand why you didn\u2019t want to leave it there and just did it, he was being an ass about it and there\u2019s a cat hazard about!
