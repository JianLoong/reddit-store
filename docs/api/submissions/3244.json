He\u2019s always talking and I adore it. Admittedly, my wife isn\u2019t a huge fan of kids but she knows how much I love my nephews and my brother and his wife so she compromises (the same way I compromise with her having her homophobic mother over very often). \n\nAnyways, so we had eaten dinner and were sitting down in the living room. I put on my nephew\u2019s favourite movie which is Coco. He kept telling us how he wanted to be a singer like the main character (Miguel) and would sing along and perform every song. My wife didn\u2019t look entertained but she was involved and talking to us so I didn\u2019t think there was an issue. \n\nWell he kept singing this one song and my wife slammed her cup of tea on the table and yelled at him to shut up and proceeded to say that he was a terrible singer and would never be like Miguel. He obviously began to sob and ran to his parents who were furious. They told my wife that if she had an issue with his singing she could\u2019ve told them and they could\u2019ve distracted him. Then they left. \n\nMy wife looked at me and laughed saying that she was just telling the truth but I wasn\u2019t having it. I told her that she was a massive bully and had no right to speak to him that way. She told me to chill the fuck out and she was just doing the world a favour by crushing his dreams. She said this as a joke but it didn\u2019t sit right with me AT ALL. I guess I made a face of disbelief and shock because she sounded so cruel to me and asked her if she was proud of herself and sarcastically said \u201cbecause boy am I glad my wife crushed my little nephew\u2019s dreams!\u201d \n\nShe told me to \u201cstop mocking her\u201d and then called me dramatic and an over sensitive bitch who should defend her and take her side as her wife. She\u2019s never called me that before and now I\u2019m wondering if I was wrong to mock her and not even attempt to defend her. But also why was she taking so much pride in what she said? Idk...

It makes me feel like maybe your wife is using you in someway she seems abusive and controlling. What kind of cruel person couldn\u2019t hurt a four year-old what next is she going to make a fur coat out of puppies? Seriously you should reevaluate your relationship with your wife this is a very big red flag. How long have you been married to her? Do you really know who she is? Obviously not this is probably the first time you\u2019re seeing her true colors and I promise you this is her true colors anyone who could be cruel to a four-year-old child is not a good person who says such hurtful, spiteful things to a child and then laughs about it, and then expects you to take her side and reverses it makes you look like you\u2019re the asshole she\u2019s gaslighting you making you feel like you\u2019re crazy for feeling some kind of way that you have a right to feel because what she did was not right this is not OK when somebody loves another person they do not do this kind of behavior towards their family because they will love their family just because they love that person they\u2019re with especially knowing how important they are to you obviously she doesn\u2019t care about anything you care about and everything is about her and her homophobic. Mom seems to be a big red flag. It also seems to be an indicator into her personality, and who she is because I know damn well that if I had a family member who was homophobic and didn\u2019t support me in my love of my partner mother, not father, or not family or not, I would cut them off because families not always blood, but she still insists on having a relationship with her homophobic mother that says a lot to me and it should say a lot to you", "Based on what you\u2019ve said OP, I don\u2019t think your wife just \u201cdoesn\u2019t like kids\u201d, it sounds like she hates them.

What she said was cruel & unnecessary & instead of apologising profusely she thinks its ok & funny.

You probably need a divorce dude. Because say further down the line a niece or nephew comes out as gay. What\u2019s she going to do then?

It fucked me up. I was forced to take piano lessons once I got older and I never could play it without having a straight up panic attack. Your wife is awful. If she\u2019s anything like my mother, keep her far away from that little boy.", "NTA. Your wife is trash.", "NTA.  Let's review what she has revealed about herself here:\n\n 1) Screams at someone much smaller and more powerless than them\n\n2) Does not apologize for her unhinged outburst\n\n 3) Does not care that she deeply hurt someone, and in fact made it her goal.  Kids take this stuff to heart.  Do you have any idea how hard his parents are going to have to work to undo her damage?  I only hope she didn't make him afraid to ever sing in public again, which apparently what she wanted.  Think about this one really hard.  This is a separate point because  what she did was fundamentally different and worse than just snapping \"thats enough!\" or \"shut up!\"\n\n 4) Does not care that she hurt someone you care about, even if she is kind if meh on them.  \n\n5) Does not care that she damaged your relationship with your sibling\n\n6) Is now gaslighting you into apologizing.  Seriously, she was laughing about deeply hurting a 4 year old, yet somehow pointing that out is the cruel thing?  Excuse me?\n\nI know you say this isn't typical behavior, but I'm having a hard time believing that an otherwise kind and considerate person who is thoughtful about the impact they have on others would act like this out of the blue.  It's not even what she said, it's the complete lack of remorse.  She sounds worse than your average high school mean girl.  I suspect someone who was more objective would not find this behavior so surprising", "NTA. Please don't apologise. Kids need all the encouragement they can get, especially from those closest to them. The rest of the world will be all too eager to tear them down. \n\nHonestly, if she acknowledged she went too far then I'd say let it go as a bad day.

That\u2019s an actual problem that needs to be addressed by a professional.

She needs a stern conversation setting a boundary about that from here on out bc whew that is not ok!!", "NTA Sounds like she has been unhappily putting up with having the kids around longer than her nerves could deal with and finally snapped. Even if that\u2019s the case I would have just removed myself and let you know I was going to leave the house until they were gone instead just to get a break away from the kids. Sounds like you guys need to set a time limit for how long both her mother and your nieces/nephews can stay since it\u2019s obvious she doesn\u2019t enjoy being around them much and probably feels obligated to put up with them and you don\u2019t like her mother much and probably feel obligated to put up with her.", "NTA \n\nThat was unacceptable behavior by your wife.

There\u2019s also nothing for you to apologize for but if she wants an apology then tell her you will if she apologizes to your nephew first.

She kind of showed you what kind of person she really is by not apologizing for what she did and expecting you to apologize to her for calling out her own childish and cruel behavior. It\u2019s pretty messed up she took pride in bullying your nephew too, because imagine if you and her unexpectedly had a kid together.

I\u2019ve done a lot of work on myself and communication but I still fear confrontation and just yesterday I said something to my sister in the heat of the moment that was wrong and it took me a day and a half of mulling it over to sort out a simple apology via text because apologizing is such a stressful and foreign thing to me. I still use DBT worksheets to handle interpersonal issues and I have to text because I need hours/days to process and explain what I need to say. \n\nIf you bottle up your feelings and try to \u201cplay nice\u201d, you\u2019ll snap eventually and lash out. Then if you\u2019re afraid of confrontation, you\u2019ll try to laugh off and justify the shitty thing you did or said to make it go away. Then if that doesn\u2019t work, you\u2019ll find some justification to convince yourself that the other person is wrong and needs to get over it and move on. And all of those problems go hand in hand and come from your upbringing. A household that avoids expressing emotions also avoids confrontation, avoids admitting wrongdoing, and ignores conflict when it does occur, moving on as if nothing happened without addressing the problem. I\u2019ve seen my own family members go through this exact series of reactions so many times and I spent most of my life in that cycle. I have said some horribly mean things when I snapped after bottling things up for years and have felt guilty about every single one ever since it happened (and these things happened 10-20 years ago now), but I never admitted guilt, I never apologized, I never explained what happened internally that led me to say something I didn\u2019t mean at all in an outburst, and I never addressed the issues that led to that moment or were caused by it with the people around me. Granted, I was a kid and teen when I behaved this way, but I also lucked out in a way by having severe depression that led me to many years of therapy at age 18, where I learned about these toxic patterns and how to break out of it and become a better communicator and friend. I see my grown family members who have never been to therapy do this over and over. On a rare occasion, what they say when they lash out is so horrible that I react the way OP reacted to this, appalled and shocked that they would say anything so repugnant and even more shocked that they would defend it and get angry with me for looking shocked\u2026 until I remember that I know this pattern and that the more defensive they are about it, the less they actually meant what they said. \n\nOP\u2019s wife\u2019s behaviors from the beginning to end are so precisely similar to what my family does, I can\u2019t help but think that she didn\u2019t actually mean anything she said and just keeps digging herself into a deeper hole, scrambling to avoid confrontation. You HAVE to be avoidant and raised in an avoidant household to have a homophobic mom who you talk to regularly as an out gay person, right? That relationship indicates that they\u2019re both sweeping things under the rug.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t excuse any of her actions, she\u2019s a grown woman who should be working on self improvement and unlearning the bullshit from her childhood, but I think it\u2019s a possible explanation.

I am a stay-at-home mom of 3 kids.  Sensory overload is real.  I have said and done things that I'm not proud of.  Yet, I think it's important to acknowledge your mistakes and apologize.  Hopefully, this shows our children how to do the same.  OP's wife needs to apologize.", "OP\u2019s wife was definitely projecting by acting like OP is the bad guy when it\u2019s clearly her.", "I'll tell you something I rarely tell other people. My life was filled with friends and close family, people I loved and thought loved me in return. For years they gave me no reason to suspect their feelings were anything but genuine.\n\nOne day I was in a traumatic MVA, where my right hand was wrenched open and hanging on by a flap of skin along the front. I broke my leg in two places and was hospitalized for 10 days. Needless to say I had a prolonged recovery.\n\nLiterally everyone disappeared from life except my husband. I was cognitively intact but very few visited, fewer still called. They all popped back up once I was back on my feet. I now categorize them in my mind as fair weather friends.\n\nHere's the part that shocked the shit out of me. There were a few people who hovered around just to view my painful recovery. It's like they enjoyed watching me struggle. I could tell by the shitty little grin on their faces. It was nauseating to realize they were getting off on my pain because I'd known them most of my life and never realized they were like this.\n\nYour wife has just shown you that nauseating core component of her personality that gets off on seeing another person's pain. It's something these people keep closely guarded but once you see it, you can't unsee it. If you stay with her, one day when you're vulnerable, you'll realize how much she enjoys your pain. You would be the AH yourself if stayed with this person.", "Yep. There is a huge difference between people who don't really enjoy kids/don't want them and a person who is cruel and hateful to a small child doing things that a small child would normally do.\n\nOP's wife is a giant asshole and OP did the right thing by not defending her.", "Pavarotti*", "Will it happen again? I can't imagine the boys parents bringing him around OP if her partner is there. She was relentlessly awful to the kid.", "Yea came here to say this, check in with her and help her to feel supported in case something is going on.", "THIS", "Not so sure she is a narcissist, but she has no empathy and took pleasure in hurting a child emotionally, which is more sociopathic traits.", "I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you!", "OP, this is not the woman for you. She is going to force you into choosing between her and your family. If you choose wrong, you are going to end up isolated and a victim to even more  abuse. If I were your sibling, you'd already be cut off, regardless of if your spouse apologuzes.", "Agreed - though if I lost my temper and yelled at an annoying 4 year old, I would at least know not to expect an apology from others for \u201cforcing\u201d me to the point I lost my temper.  This expecting others to apologize to her, to me is the most concerning behavior and I think it is fair to assume this is not the first time she used such manipulative/questionable reasoning.", "I need to know. What is DTMFA?", "That\u2019s also what fcking narcissist do too", "Divorce that motherducking asshole I assumed but im probably wrong, it would still be a good advice tho", "My children are 12 and 13 and SHE would have been eating those words sprinkled with salt and pepper by the time I got through with her ass!", "\u201cBrutally honest\u201d is often just a euphemism for \u201casshole.\u201d", "This is the type of thing a child never forgets. He will have self esteem issues and trauma from this. It's terrible.", "Unfortunately, I learned that the hard way. Fortunately, I'm rid of such a person, so there's one headache less!", "Yeah why does OP have an obligation to take her wife's side and not the other way around?", "OP, you are NTA yet, you will be if you let this happen again. Something similar happened in my family. My aunt and mother had a 16 year age gap and my uncle came into the family when my mother was four and he relentlessly bullied her. No one knows why. It absolutely destroyed my mother\u2019s and aunt\u2019s relationship for several decades. It wasn\u2019t until about a year before my aunt died (she already knew she wasn\u2019t going to recover) that she and my mother managed to somewhat repair their relationship. Please protect your nephew!", "No, don't apologise. Her behaviour is downright abusive. Perhaps there may be some clues as to why in her apparently good relationship with her homophobic mother? Seems odd to me. NTA", "Do not apologize. I cannot imagine a world where this is acceptable to say to a child ever.", "So I can understand the aggravation of a song on repeat. Single mom of twins here, trust me, i get it. And if I ever run into a certain purple dinosaur in a dark alley, I'm going to reenact \"Death to Smoochy,\" but unlike the movie, I'm gonna get 'im. \n\nThat said, *your wife just showed her true colors.* Believe her. *This is the mom she's going to be. This is the Aunt she's going to be.* I UNDERSTAND a moment of AAARRRGGGHHHH!!! But if you're a decent human being, you take a powder, recover, and apologize for your outburst. Had she done this, I'd say *maybe* it was a fluke. She didn't. She doubled down and defended bullying a 4-year old AS AN ADULT. What a NASTY piece of work she is. If you now told me she spends all her free time volunteering at abused kid's shelters? I'd say she's probably doing it for the glory, to point out how awesome she is, not because she has any decency.  \n\nNTA, OP. She needs to be put in her place. Which is the gutter. Go find a decent partner. Someone with whom you can have a truly happy life. You deserve it. \n\nMay you both have the lives you deserve \ud83d\udc93", "Please don\u2019t apologize.. my mom was such a bully to me when i was growing up .. and it really fuck up my confident! And everytime i responded in my favor she will make herself look like the victim so i apologize, giving her a open door to keep bulling me .. so stand your ground and dont let her do that ever again", "Well she\u2019s showed you a part of her true self. Want to stick around to see the rest that she\u2019s hiding or see this cruelty come out more often? \n\nI\u2019d start rethinking if I\u2019d want this for the rest of my life\u2026", "I just wanna say I'm so sorry for you that this happened and that she's like this. I hope things will be solved one way or another.", "And cruel.", "This right here.", "I could see that, and it\u2019s honestly just toxic when an adult thinks they\u2019re competing with a child for love.", "Good catch. We often forget the horrible motivations of some horrible people.", "I refuse to give her an adjective she will likely accept as a compliment. \n\nShe's a weak and pathetic cretin taking out her suppressed anger over her homophobic mom and projecting it on a defenseless toddler. The fact she feels this is an achievement is what really makes her God's mistake.", "Yeah like listen, I'll make fun of people's kids to other people. It is usually light teasing or joking. But I can never in 10 million years imagine saying something that awful to the kids face or in front of their parents, especially for normal kid behavior.", "It's really common for deadbeat dads to only take an interest in their kids for the sake of appearances for a new gf. If you even need to have a conversation with a dude in the first place about how he should actually pay his child support, move on and look elsewhere. Why would you want to be with someone who is only doing the bare minimum because you said you would leave him if he didn't? Glad (and not surprised) this guy is an ex.", "To be fair to my ex? There were no signs he was going to be a deadbeat when we had the conversation. I decided to just be up front about my expectations regarding his children because of my own experience as the disposable child. I refuse to do that to someone else.", "Yes.  Sensory overload is real. But the adult can remove themselves from it. To another room etc. just to take a few minutes to themselves. As the kiddo was singing and entertaining the crowd, no one would have noticed. But they did notice her flipping tantrum\nAnd bullying.", "Yes. I can be brutally honest in my head but i know how to hold it and how to sandwhich it if it is something that must be said. Like, if shopping with a friend and they ask my opinion on an outfit that truly does not flatter them, (and i warn them before we go that when it comes to that i will not lie) then I will absolutely say that it does not flatter them- i will say something like \u2018the length is really good but the colour and cut are a no. Do they have one in \u2018colour that suits them\u2019 in a slightly different cut that you could try on to compare with?\u201d \nI would never do what this person did. You can be honest and still polite- \u201cwhy don\u2019t you go sing in the bathroom they have really good acoustics\u201d, \u201cwhat other show do you like, I think it is time to watch something else\u201d or \u201cdo you want a cookie? Remember not to sing with food in your mouth!\u201d \nSo many people think being \u2018brutally honest\u2019 is a point of pride and licence to be an asshole. They\u2019re jerks.", "Or a backhanded apology.\n\n\"I'm sorry you like to bully a four year old to the point of tears and then play the victim when I stand up for him. I wish I knew this side of you so I could have avoided marrying you. I'm going to spend time with my family. Your silent treatment is basically a gift, not a punishment.\"", "Your wife sounds viler the more you describe her. There is speaking your mind, and then there is being a bully. It sounds like she gets pleasure from humiliating and hurting people.", "Sounds to me like she likes to shit on people", "That got me the most, if she would be like I'm so sorry that happened I really don't know why I just did that ill work on my problem, BUT she started LAUGHING?", "I never \"liked kids\" and am known for being outspoken... with adults! I would NEVER, NEVER speak this way to a child. If a room of kids gets to be too much, leave the gd room. Jesus, what is wrong with people??", "Thanks for this very interesting insight. This kind of behavior pattern seems so foreign to me, but it makes sense.", "I really love your thoughtful analysis. It's very cool that you've come so far and clearly did a lot of hard work in therapy! It helps to at least understand why people behave this way. Now it's time for the OP's wife to do some heavy work on herself, apologize, take responsibility for her actions, and do her best to make amends for her behavior. I truly hope this is a one-off situation, but I am concerned that this is going to be the start of a pattern. And the OP needs to know she is not obligated to stick around.", "That's true. I remember when I watched it at seven or eight thinking she was horrible to bring up boarding school...especially after Maria spent all day long singing with them. Then again, apparently the real Maria von Trapp was something of a drill master and the real Captain von Trapp was a lot jollier...", "My ex was being diligent when we had that conversation. My parents both decided I was disposable so I wanted to set expectations. It was when he asked for exclusivity in dating. Came with the \"If you hit me we are over. If you lie we are over.\" List. I wouldn't want to be with someone who was doing the bare minimum for me vs for their kids but the reality is abusers are very conscious of what people want and can maintain that for years if they have to. 5 years of dating and engagement and 3 months of marriage in my ex's case. 6 months of trying to survive and not die after the death of the relationship. He actually was shocked I tried to leave. He also then locked me in a room for 6 months and was shocked I tried to have charges brought on him and became the angriest person alive in his view. \n\nTheir understanding only extends as far as getting what they want.", "All of this, especially since OP values her family which includes her nephew. It\u2019s disgusting any adult would think it\u2019s acceptable to treat a child that way. If OP\u2019s wife doesn\u2019t want to accept that shes the one who needs to apologize in this situation, OP definitely needs to let her go.", "Exactly, if she was annoyed with him she could\u2019ve left the room rather than spewing harsh words at a kid just being a kid.", "Right? Like usually I\u2019m all about \u201cyou can\u2019t judge someone by one bad action\u201d or \u201cwe can\u2019t know the whole story from one Reddit post\u201d but nah, I despise this person. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t even like little kids that much myself. I might THINK the stuff she said if a kid\u2019s singing was getting on my nerves, but my God I\u2019d never SAY it. Let alone double down on it and demand an apology from my spouse for calling me out on it!", "Yeah I feel that, my dad made fun of me as a kid when I LOVED singing, now I can't even sing when I'm by myself because I'm afraid someone will hear me... \nThis can have so much impact on a kid...", "I really appreciate you and the previous post are pointing this out. I am recognizing this more than myself with my own small children. Lashing out being please stop because I\u2019ve reached my limit and not bullying them. But what the OP swiped it was definitely bullying and that is a huge difference. Again, this is where I wonder. What is this really the first time or is this part of a bigger problem?", "I\u2019m high functioning autistic. My wife\u2019s family can get extremely loud and manic at get togethers, especially the kids.\n\nKnow what I do when I get overstimulated? I go outside and sit on the porch to be by myself for a bit before coming back in.\n\nYou remove yourself from the situation, instead of doing what OP\u2019s wife did."]}
