He\u2019s always talking and I adore it. Admittedly, my wife isn\u2019t a huge fan of kids but she knows how much I love my nephews and my brother and his wife so she compromises (the same way I compromise with her having her homophobic mother over very often). \n\nAnyways, so we had eaten dinner and were sitting down in the living room. I put on my nephew\u2019s favourite movie which is Coco. He kept telling us how he wanted to be a singer like the main character (Miguel) and would sing along and perform every song. My wife didn\u2019t look entertained but she was involved and talking to us so I didn\u2019t think there was an issue. \n\nWell he kept singing this one song and my wife slammed her cup of tea on the table and yelled at him to shut up and proceeded to say that he was a terrible singer and would never be like Miguel. He obviously began to sob and ran to his parents who were furious. They told my wife that if she had an issue with his singing she could\u2019ve told them and they could\u2019ve distracted him. Then they left. \n\nMy wife looked at me and laughed saying that she was just telling the truth but I wasn\u2019t having it. I told her that she was a massive bully and had no right to speak to him that way. She told me to chill the fuck out and she was just doing the world a favour by crushing his dreams. She said this as a joke but it didn\u2019t sit right with me AT ALL. I guess I made a face of disbelief and shock because she sounded so cruel to me and asked her if she was proud of herself and sarcastically said \u201cbecause boy am I glad my wife crushed my little nephew\u2019s dreams!\u201d \n\nShe told me to \u201cstop mocking her\u201d and then called me dramatic and an over sensitive bitch who should defend her and take her side as her wife. She\u2019s never called me that before and now I\u2019m wondering if I was wrong to mock her and not even attempt to defend her. But also why was she taking so much pride in what she said? Idk...

I don't mean to bust out some outlandish armchair psychology theory, but I already gestured at it in another comment, so...\n\nIs that what she wanted, to create the same distance between you and your family as exists between her and her homophobic mother? Obviously you have her (the mother) around more than you're comfortable with, and she's acting like dealing with a normal little kid is somehow equivalent with dealing with a hateful adult.

That being said, if anyone said something like that to my 3yo niece, I would have gone psycho mama bear. Totally unacceptable, and I sincerely hope you do NOT apologize to that horrid woman. I wouldn't let her around my family ever again.", "This is a very interesting equivalence. Yikes.
