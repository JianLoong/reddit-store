She's currently studying to be a masseuse and she wants people to test on so she offers 4 discount massages every month for \u20ac45. I booked one and paid her upfront.\n\nOn the day of the massage she messaged me in the morning that she was sick and that she wanted to cancel the massage for the day. I didn't respond until late evening because I was working, but when I did respond I told her I saw it, it's fine and I hope she feels better.\n\nA couple of days later she texted me if I wanted half my money back or if I wanted to rebook for half the money. This struck me as odd and I didn't fully understand what she meant. I said I'd like to rebook since I already paid for it anyways. We set up a date and shw sent me a payment request for \u20ac22,50. I told her I already paid for the massage and she went on to explain that she put on her page that she'll keep half of the money if the massage is cancelled.\n\nI was a bit baffled and told her that this was surely meant for costumers because if it were up to me, I would've come over. She said she didn't know that since I didn't respond in time to her message and therefore she wanted either half of the money for a new appointment or she'd give me back half the money.\n\nIt really messed with my head, if she keeps the money Everytime she cancels why not cancel everytime then. It seems unfair to me. I told her I was not gonna pay more money because I'm not big on funds and did this also to help her out. So either she'd give everything back or I'd get a new appointment.\n\nShe told me she'd then give me half back and I got really mad at her and told her she's a scammer. Some friends are siding with her because I'm notoriously bad at responding (it overwhelms me sometimes so I shut off my phone) and they felt that she was right about me having to respond to her. I responded to her before the original time we booked the appointment so I don't think it was that bad. \n\nSo aita for refusing to pay more/wanting all of my money back?", "created_utc": 1671050392, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zm1l3l/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_more_money_for_a_massage/", "score": 1161, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your friend is running a scam on you and her policies are appalling. She canceled you noted that and since you where busy you went on with your day. It was not on you to reply because she was canceling. Plus at the end you said you replied before appointments time. So tell your friends that from an actual professional you are right and your friend will go out of business if she continues this practice because massage is a word of mouth and reviews type of business and it does not take much to ruin it.

Grandma/Grandpa were on a fixed income & also had a HUGE medical tab building up and could not afford the bill. They disputed the charges, but we denied because the thief had access to her card (he lived with them). The only way they could overturn the denial was to file a police report & press charges (they did, bro somehow only got 30 days in jail). \n\nIn OP's case, \"friend\" didn't take her card, but b/c they might be linked through socials, which would probably show \"friend\" is becoming a massage therapist/has a masseuse business, and that could be enough to deny the dispute & label it Friendly Fraud, again depending on the financial company's policy. aka some Crap People got in some spats with friends or family & issued chargebacks to one-up the friends/family and now we all get shit credit if we find ourselves in a situation like OP. \n\nI put quotes around friend b/c this person is not acting like a friend. I agree 100% \"Friend\" is acting like a scammer, she absolutely will be stealing OP's money if she doesn't issue a full refund OR reschedule with ZERO additional charges. Her policy for cancellations would *only* be valid if OP had been the one to cancel. \n\nI also find it strange the \"friend\" is charging. I was asked once if I wanted a free massage because some friend-of-a-friend I had in High School was going to school to be a masseuse, they said she wasn't allowed to charge but needed X hours of practice for school. Granted, that was almost 30 years ago and might be a limit of the state or the school, so who knows if that's true in OP's case.\n\nI like the suggestion some made of contacting \"friend's\" school & discussing the situation because \"friend\" is not behaving ethically, which I'm sure they will not like since she is their student. Depending on how that goes, it might not be a bad idea for OP to also contact her local police non-emergent line to talk to them about pressing charges for theft. Police would be able to tell her if they can help, or where to go (attorney, small claims, things like that) if they can't help.\n\nNTA", "You didn't do anything wrong.

So since they reserved their time, I can see they policy being held to. \n\nINFO: What was the wording of the initial cancellation text? Was it a question waiting for you to answer?

If they make a false claim to being a licensed therapist, I think the consequences are heavier than if they leave their exact qualifications unspoken.  It's kind of a nebulous zone where \"I'm not licensed YET but I'm in the process of getting a license and have already had some training\" falls, since it's not an outright claim but it's certainly an implication that they're basically licensed.\n\nAgain, if they're actively pursuing a license and don't cause any actual physical harm, it's the kind of semi-victimless crime (causes harm to legitimate therapists by maybe diluting the value of their training, but nothing direct) that people will probably let slide.  But if you're actively violating even semi-victimless rules and relying on people not feeling motivated to report you, it's a TERRIBLE idea to try to pull some scummy tricks by charging them for a service you chose not to provide.  Don't piss off the people whose goodwill or indifference you're relying on to avoid consequences.\n\nI was focusing more on actual legal consequences though, individual unlicensed massage is probably pretty low priority for the police.  I think you're correct that massage schools, who are much more directly impacted by unlicensed practitioners, are MUCH more motivated to take action, and will probably kick her out and refuse to allow her to keep trying to get a license.
