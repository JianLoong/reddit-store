We had a lot of fun, playing games and chatting. I enjoyed getting to know Ben and Bella better. Around 4pm it was apparently time to go to our dinner reservations, a tavern style restaurant next door. I say apparently because last I knew the plan was only to hang out, shop and to play games. The building has a lot of entertainment style facilities and stores.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: I observe Lent. I already reminded Leah the weeks leading up that I\u2019d be giving up alcohol, spending my Sundays with my grandparents, and fasting with one meal at 7:30pm, plus a few full fast days. I even brought her to a couple doctors appointments because she was worried, where we went over what I\u2019d eat and what vitamins to take in order to make sure I got the right nutrients.\n\nWhile walking to the restaurant I managed to pull her aside while her friends kept ahead and asked her quietly when dinner got introduced to the plan, She shrugged and said I\u2019d like the place then left me behind to catch up.\n\nI tried talking to her again but I didn\u2019t want to have a talk like that in front of two people I had only met three times before but she was deep in conversation with them until the waiter came so I kept my mouth shut. Her friends started relatively benignly teasing me for not getting an alcoholic beverage and suggesting different drinks even after I said I wasn\u2019t drinking. Leah joined and laughed along which hurt.\n\nWhen the waiter came for food orders, I said I was just here for the company this time, which didn\u2019t seem to upset the waiter. When Ben asked I explained I didn\u2019t know we were doing dinner as well and apologized, which got me a weird look from Bella, but other than that it was smoothed over and we still had a good time. We made plans to hang out again and exchanged numbers.\n\nOn the ride to her place Leah was sullen and said \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u201d, then turned up the volume on the radio and said she wasn\u2019t going to talk yet or else she\u2019d say things she would regret.\n\nI was going to spend the night with her but she told me to go home. The whole drive back my phone kept going off. At first I pulled over and checked in case she\u2019d forgotten or needed anything, but it was just a rapid fire of \u201cyou know what\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so self centered\u201d\n\u201cYou embarrassed me so badly today\u201d\n\nBy the time I got home, she\u2019d sent 30 texts to basically say that I was rude to her friends and that she already compromised a lot with my \u201creligious things\u201d so I needed to compromise too. She said she wanted space to think about things, which I\u2019ll give her, but I\u2019m left wondering just how badly I messed up for her to act like this and rethinking a lot of things.\n\nETA- we don\u2019t have premarital relations. We don\u2019t even sleep in the same bed when either of us is sleeping over.\n\nEdit- we\u2019re on the fast track to breaking up. As of right now, the conversation has gone so far south I\u2019m disgusted and appalled and demanded we wait until tomorrow to continue. I\u2019ve given her another chance to explain, but we both know unless we settle this we\u2019re splitting. It\u2019s a sickening feeling. I\u2019ve spent a lot of today thinking over my relationship.\n\nEdit: she said it was a test I failed. I\u2019m not going to be able to go back after this. Maybe it shows fragility in my personality or beliefs. I can\u2019t look at her the same.", "created_utc": 1677203565, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11afco8/aita_refused_to_eat_at_an_unexpected_dinner/", "score": 1546, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were reasonable and explained ahead of time what you were going to do (observing Lent) and she\u2019s trying to push that boundary.

Everything she did was completely disrespectful of you. This us how your life is going to be for the rest of your life if you continue.

Just telling them you are observing lent, have given up alcohol and are only eating after 7:30 probably results in a few annoying questions as to why and then everyone moves on with their evening.\n\nI can see why you having a weird response of I didn\u2019t know we were going to dinner as the reason for not ordering dinner as getting weird looks from people you just met.\n\nBut your girlfriends reaction is way over the top, your actions caused no issues.

She is the only one who made this embarrassing. It\u2019s also incredibly shitty that she expects you to just\u2026not fast, for absolutely no valid reason at all. FWIW, I\u2019m an atheist and I still wouldn\u2019t treat someone this way even though I think a lot of religious practices are absurd.

As fellow person who celebrates Lent, if someone did this to me I would fast myself of them for the season. \n\nSeriously, what an intolerant, childish jerk. I am sorry you were treated this way. Don't compromise on this, because her behavior was way out of line - your politeness makes her look even worse. If she is going to treat your faith like that over this, do you believe she will respect other tenets of your faith going forward? You might want to consider the long-term viability of this relationship.\n\nHappy Lent, OP!", "NTA.\n\nI feel like there\u2019s some missing information because I cannot understand what she would be so upset about you not eating or drinking at the restaurant. That aside you still went with them and tried to make the night a good time enough though you were seemingly left out of the plans. I don\u2019t think you have anything to feel bad about. Some people are willing and wanting to compromise on their religious beliefs, and some aren\u2019t. Both are perfectly fine. But I think you should decide what you are willing and wanting to compromise on, if anything. Tell her these boundaries and that she should respect them.

Your gf is an AH.\nShe\u2019s embarrassed of you because you elected not to eat dinner at 4pm or drink an alcoholic beverage? Reasons why aren\u2019t even important, if that happened with a newcomer in my group of friends no one would even blink. What a ridiculous gripe for her to have. And to put it quit plainly for you OP, if she doesn\u2019t respect your religious practices now, she never will.

I'm not sure why you didn't want to explain you were fasting but they all should have just dropped it when you said you weren't partaking.

So christianity.com puts it like this:\n\n> Lent is meant to be a time of repentance. That\u2019s not a feeling of shame but an awareness that sin separates us from God and of what it cost Him to be reunited with us. \u201cShame has its place, but feeling shame over sin is not the same thing as repentance from sin\u201d because \u201cour tempter can take our obedience to God and turn it into a source of pride.\u201d\n\nMay I ask what ANZAC day is?\n\nEdit: Oh, and yeah, it probably should be all year. BUT we're humans, we sin (make mistakes). That's why good Christians should go to confessions regularly. I mean, no matter how hard you try, you'll probably fuck up something anyways, even if you don't mean to. And that's probably also what lent is for - to recognise that.", "See those are the answers I kept getting when googling, which didn't quite answer why this is done through fasting and such. It's a gesture then right? Like giving up something is a gesture of repentance.\n\nOh haha, my bad. Australian and New Zealand Army Corp day. It's the anniversary of the soilders landing on Gallipoli. We do a dawn service and basically remember the sacrifice these soilders made in WWI. But I think mainstream we just celebrate all soldiers, not specifically the Gallipoli event.", "I'm not a religious scholar and haven't been religious for about two decades, so no guarantee that this is correct. It's only my take!\n\nMy mum always put it as: Others are struggling as well, and refraining from things we like during lent makes us aware of that. Jesus suffered for us, and we can feel a bit of that suffering if we give up on things we love. Which, I guess, is good enough for a kid.\n\nFor the repentance aspect, I guess, you have to be \"religious enough\" to regularly pray and reflect on your past behaviour. You have to be aware that your sins and treatment of others will reflect on you and your relationship with God. As a good Christian, you should want a good relationship with Him. And by taking the time of lent to actually reflect and repent, and use that time of ... renouncing worldly joys, of sacrificing, you can become a better Christian, improve your relationship with God, and maybe even refrain from repeating sins in the future.\n\nI think fasting during Ramadan is a bit similar. You take the time of that month to reflect on your own beliefs, on how you can improve your faith, on if you're a good person, improve your relationship with Allah.\n\nAs you said, of course it can (and probably should) be done all throughout the year. But society has changed, our lives have become more hectic and, at least where I live, less religiously influenced. We didn't have any meat on Fridays when I grew up, Friday was \"fish day\" in remembrance of Good Friday. My mum told me that she wasn't allowed breakfast before going to church on Sundays. I stopped going to confessions when I was about ten or so. I don't observe lent, because for me it wouldn't hold any religious or spiritual meaning at all.\n\nIf fasting is necessary for repenting? I don't know. But if it helps people, go ahead! :)\n\nI'm not sure if I can explain it correctly. I guess it's just one of those religious (and maybe even a bit cultural) things you just have to accept. Although I do understand that \"but why is Xyz done that way\" is necessary for understanding, for grasping something. (To be honest, it's one of the reasons why I stopped believing in what I was told as a kid - I couldn't get satisfying answers. So sorry if my answers are lacking!)\n\nThanks for that explanation! Didn't know it was a thing (as I'm from Europe), but it makes totally sense. :) It's probably a bit like the folks in Normandy celebrating and remembering D-Day.", "How did she \"ignore you for the whooooole ride home\" if the dinner place was next door?

What happens if you get married, have a kid that would like to do the same things that you are doing but has a mother that will not compromise or will make them feel horrible for their religious beliefs?", "NTA. It sounds like you were very respectful about things. You observed lent and hung out. Your GF on the other hand, she sounds disrespectful and mean. I'm an Atheist at this point in my life, but I was Catholic at one point and definitely observed Lent and never had someone act like that. I definitely attended dinners that my friends asked me to but didn't eat and it was fine. I also had a bf that was very religious and we didn't have sex the entire 3 years we dated because that is what he felt was right and I respected him enough to happily refrain from that even though it wasn't my set of beliefs. It sounds like this isn't a good fit. If you date someone that doesn't share your religious views it can totally work as long as everyone is respectful and supportive, but if not it is going to cause a lot of strain on both parties.", "NTA- she has no respect for you and your boundaries.... I think you need to find someone who respect you and every aspect of you and that includes your believes. Like how self centered is it to take someone out to supper and know they are in lent and getting whinny because they didn't eat", "NTA because she knew in advance how lent goes for you.  If she'd wanted you to eat, reservations would have been centred around your meal time.  And no one should ever be bullied for not drinking alcohol no matter what their reasoning.", "NTA I hope you see these red flags and leave. 30 texts on just your ride home because she\u2019s inconsiderate? No", "NTA. Your gf tried to flex and make you break Lent to \"be polite\" and it didn't work. Now she's being nasty about it. I'm not sure if you explained to her friends that you were fasting for religious reasons, but if you didn't, they likely would've been very understanding.

I would have a serious think about her completely disrespectful and bigoted treatment of you and whether that's something you want in a partner.\n\nI would lose a huge amount of respect for her based on these actions and as she seems to believe she is in the right and not going to apologise, this would be break up level issues to me.", "NTA I would agree about reconsidering the relationship.

It doesn't matter to me if op was fasting for lent, doing one meal a day as a diet, trying to save money/be healthy by eating at home, simply wasn't hungry -- getting mad at him for not eating (at a restaurant meal he didn't even know about, at that!) is not acceptable.", "Yeah, the whole thing is deeply concerning, especially the part where OP genuinely thinks he might have been wrong for \\*checks notes\\* adhering to religious practices that his gf was well aware of before she made plans.

Lots of people don't make it through Lent with their promises intact, and they still tend to be Catholic at the end of it.", "There were reservations, though? They had to leave at a certain time to make their reservations. At the very least, it's pretty thoughtless to make those kinds of reservations during Lent and not even try to get the timing right so that OP could maybe at least have his one meal with them. Her anger afterwards is honestly what makes me think it was planned. Any decent person would have apologized to OP for being inconsiderate of his religious practices instead of getting mad at him for abiding by them. Sure, she could be embarrassed, but the reaction is really exaggerated for that. Sending him home? Thirty rage-texts while he's on the road? Either she's just way too hung up on this, or something else is going on.\n\nI also do want to say that even if it wasn't planned, her behavior is pretty bizarre, and a big red flag. I'm trying to imagine sitting around sending someone angry texts like that -- someone I know, someone I (supposedly) love -- and I just can't get there in my mind. why? why would I do that? why did *she* do that? what's going on with her? I think she's trying to browbeat him into something. and I think it's concerning that it came so close to working. OP was worried enough that he'd done something wrong that he had to come ask reddit about it. where did he get the idea that anything here could be his fault? has she done this before? is he used to it?\n\nI just really think this whole situation looks like Leah doesn't respect OP's religious beliefs and thinks she can change them by... sabotaging Lent? which, lots of people don't make it all the way through Lent with their promises intact. they still stay Catholic.", "It's why I don't usually like going out with people who drink. It's so frustrating to be peer pressured into drinking. I don't drink because I hate the taste, and because I'm on meds that you shouldn't drink with.", "Yeah\u2026doctor appts for a Lenten fast? Maybe if OP was diabetic but also this is a grown adult\u2026seems weird", "I pretty much could tell.  Our ideas about theism and atheism are not the same as Christians'... I saw a comment that some of the normative Jewish beliefs about God among Jews who believe in God would be considered atheism among Christians, and that normative Christian ideas about God would be considered avodah zarah or idolatry by Jews.\n\nNot having any sort of strong concept of what God is or isn't - having some general concepts but not believing that God has any fundamentally knowable or understandable characteristics, and might be \"The Universe\" or something like that - that is a typical Jewish theistic position.  And it is a Christian atheistic position.\n\nBut believing that God does have human-comprehensible ideas, like the \"personal agreement with God about what your Lent should be\" that a lot of people have - from a Jewish perspective, that is idolatry ....", "I really hope you ignore those comments about \"picking and choosing\". \nNobody gets to dictate how you celebrate your faith.", "Fair. That\u2019s true.", "Nope. You choose how you will do it. This is the first time I've heard OP's variant. In some cases you don't eat meat for the full 40 days, only fish and not even that on Fridays, or no food at all one day a week. Some people don't do that but they quit smoking, or don't drink, or cut out something else, and donate the money they didn't spend etc.\n\nThe point is sacrifice, but WHAT you sacrifice is entirely optional and everything counts. I've known people who gave up bread or chocolate, or even sex.\n\nNTA, OP.

Perhaps they\u2019d find it funny, my lack of sexual activity is not directly related to my faith and beliefs while it is colored by it. \n\nThere are people who follow faith dogmatically to the letter of what they are told by someone else, be it a religious figure or authority and that is perfectly valid. My convictions come from what I\u2019ve internally decided I agree with from what I\u2019ve read and listened to others.

The bartender loudly started harassing me for not drinking. Like sorry I don't want to drink at noon.", "That\u2019s such a good response!! I need to use this now :))", "So I am Episcopalian and not at all fundamentalist, but we observe Lent. The idea of fasting or giving something up has a couple of facets. \n\nYou are supposed to be walking Christ's journey with him. Part of that was privation and temptation in the desert. Giving up something or fasting makes you feel the loss, and you can be tempted by seeing it everywhere. It brings home the idea that Jesus was hungry and tempted for a full 40 days in the desert. It lets you see how strong the temptation would have been and how likely it is that most would have succumbed. \n\nAnother piece that goes along the same lines is that whenever you are missing the thing or feeling the hunger or temptation, you are supposed to pray. You are supposed to gain empathy for those who suffer from hunger all the time. You are supposed to draw closer to God and work to make life better for others.\n\nMany modern Lenten observations include taking something on instead of giving something up. It serves the same purpose of working to make life better for others and praying more. The only groups I know of that really has a defined way of doing Lent are Orthodox churches (Russian Orthodox, etc). Most of the others that observe Lent do it where everyone decides the method for themselves. \n\nNo matter if this was group or individual for the OP, his girlfriend was being awful.", "She laughed at you about something that is important to you, why are you with this girl?

Think about what you would respond to it. Start from there and think on it some more.", "NTA.  If she can't respect your devotion to your religion, you may need to rethink this relationship.  I would have told her friends that I was fasting for religious purposes so that they understood what was going on.  Your girlfriend does not respect you enough to continue forward unless you two talk seriously and she apologizes.  Right now, it's Lent.  Eventually, she is going to push other boundaries if she feels like your religion is interfering with her fun or time.", "Here's the thing OP.... if you are in a relationship with someone who does not respect or understand your religious beliefs, you shouldn't be in a relationship with them. Having different beliefs is one thing, I have plenty of friends that have different religious, political, etc. beliefs. BUT they still respect mine as I do for them. Her wanting you to compromise them for just a dinner out with friends means she doesn't respect your lifestyle. Her choice, but means you shouldn't have a life with her. Do yourself and your beliefs a favor and end things with her.", "NTA. That was an incredibly hostile way to treat you and just because she is angry or rethinking the relationship doesn\u2019t mean you did something wrong.", "NTA\nspeaking as someone who\u2019s agnostic but grew up jewish, I\u2019d be extremely upset if someone had tried to force me to eat non-kosher foods. \nShe explicitly did not answer any questions leading up to the dinner and explicitly refused to let you speak during the drive home. \n\nThis is definitely going to be a repeated behaviour and not going to end well", "I was thinking the same thing! This relationship was doomed from the start. There's no way she'd be willing to do everything required to convert to Catholicism. And then she'd have to promise to raise their children in the Church.", "Yeah, yeah, yeah, we get it, you're an AH.", "\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f at least I'm not wasting my time with an adult man who won't even snooze in the same bed as me lest he have a scary thought-sin.", "It makes them feel bad that they \u201cneed\u201d the alcohol to have fun, and think you\u2019re saying you don\u2019t and are therefore superior. \n\nFun fact, I\u2019m unsocial as fuck. Alcohol definitely makes me relax and able to have fun/act like a \u201cnormal\u201d human. So you could say I legitimately do \u201cneed\u201d alcohol to have fun. (Well I should say for other people to think I\u2019m fun. I have fun doing my puzzles and talking to online plant groups) But I don\u2019t like that feeling that drinking gives me. I don\u2019t know if I don\u2019t like it because of my anxiety or maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m not neurotypical. \n\nEither way, I have a drink maybe once a year. And I say maybe because I actually haven\u2019t had a drink since 2019 because I moved at the start of the pandemic and have yet to make friends here lol. Screw people who try to make anyone feel bad for not drinking.", "You\u2019re welcome not to date, or interact with, those whose views don\u2019t align with yours or those that seem backwards or immoral or inappropriate. You\u2019re welcome not to agree with those views. In fact, you\u2019re encouraged to follow those convictions as it will likely result in a stronger bond between you two. \n\nI will say, if you want to listen, you\u2019ve made a number of bold leaps about what I hold sacred, what the Bible and religious teachings inspire in me, and why I don\u2019t wish to share a sleeping space with my partner. I\u2019m willing to talk if you would like to listen, or even debate, but I understand that\u2019s not what you came to this sub for or what you posted your judgement for.", "I was raised Catholic, so I get the seriousness for lent. Even though I don\u2019t associate myself with the religion anymore, and have very strong opinions about it, you are absolutely NTA. I feel like she was trying to compete with your religion, and trying to put you in a position of \u201cwhat\u2019s more important? Me or your traditions?\u201d which is grossly wack of her.", "NTA\n\n> Around 4pm it was apparently time to go to our dinner reservations\n\nThat's **lunchtime**.", "That\u2019s exactly what she said tonight. That she tested my faith against \u201cus\u201d and found me lacking. It\u2019s disgusting.
