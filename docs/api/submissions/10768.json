We had a lot of fun, playing games and chatting. I enjoyed getting to know Ben and Bella better. Around 4pm it was apparently time to go to our dinner reservations, a tavern style restaurant next door. I say apparently because last I knew the plan was only to hang out, shop and to play games. The building has a lot of entertainment style facilities and stores.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: I observe Lent. I already reminded Leah the weeks leading up that I\u2019d be giving up alcohol, spending my Sundays with my grandparents, and fasting with one meal at 7:30pm, plus a few full fast days. I even brought her to a couple doctors appointments because she was worried, where we went over what I\u2019d eat and what vitamins to take in order to make sure I got the right nutrients.\n\nWhile walking to the restaurant I managed to pull her aside while her friends kept ahead and asked her quietly when dinner got introduced to the plan, She shrugged and said I\u2019d like the place then left me behind to catch up.\n\nI tried talking to her again but I didn\u2019t want to have a talk like that in front of two people I had only met three times before but she was deep in conversation with them until the waiter came so I kept my mouth shut. Her friends started relatively benignly teasing me for not getting an alcoholic beverage and suggesting different drinks even after I said I wasn\u2019t drinking. Leah joined and laughed along which hurt.\n\nWhen the waiter came for food orders, I said I was just here for the company this time, which didn\u2019t seem to upset the waiter. When Ben asked I explained I didn\u2019t know we were doing dinner as well and apologized, which got me a weird look from Bella, but other than that it was smoothed over and we still had a good time. We made plans to hang out again and exchanged numbers.\n\nOn the ride to her place Leah was sullen and said \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u201d, then turned up the volume on the radio and said she wasn\u2019t going to talk yet or else she\u2019d say things she would regret.\n\nI was going to spend the night with her but she told me to go home. The whole drive back my phone kept going off. At first I pulled over and checked in case she\u2019d forgotten or needed anything, but it was just a rapid fire of \u201cyou know what\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so self centered\u201d\n\u201cYou embarrassed me so badly today\u201d\n\nBy the time I got home, she\u2019d sent 30 texts to basically say that I was rude to her friends and that she already compromised a lot with my \u201creligious things\u201d so I needed to compromise too. She said she wanted space to think about things, which I\u2019ll give her, but I\u2019m left wondering just how badly I messed up for her to act like this and rethinking a lot of things.\n\nETA- we don\u2019t have premarital relations. We don\u2019t even sleep in the same bed when either of us is sleeping over.", "created_utc": 1677203565, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11afco8/aita_refused_to_eat_at_an_unexpected_dinner/", "score": 640, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she's going to behave like this over your religious choices, or any personal choices, you need to reevaluate what future you have with someone who behaves like it is a personal affront when you don't just go with the flow when she springs things on you. This is the beginning of types of behaviors I don't think you'll particularly care for.

Don't let her twist this into something where its your fault, because it absolutely is not man. This is 100% on her and it sounds like she doesn't respect you or your beliefs.

You were reasonable and explained ahead of time what you were going to do (observing Lent) and she\u2019s trying to push that boundary. As a practicing Catholic myself, it\u2019s hard being in a relationship with someone who doesn\u2019t see eye to eye on faith. Good for you for wanting to commit to these Lenten practices! I really recommend checking out the Catholicism subreddit and posting there for advice too! God bless!", "NTA. You\u2019re not the one messing up. Personally, I find Lent stuff ridiculous, therefore I don\u2019t observe it. However I don\u2019t begrudge anyone their religious observances and I would never ask someone to ignore it on my behalf. Everything she did was completely disrespectful of you. This us how your life is going to be for the rest of your life if you continue. Personally you should be doing a lot of thinking yourself while she\u2019s needing space to think. Has she disrespected other things that are important to you or your family? Has she made fun of other things you do? Just keep these things in mind.", "Take this as a huge opportunity not to take responsibility for other people\u2019s feelings and behaviors.

I hadn\u2019t heard of that observance of fasting before in Catholics.  Much more of a Ramadan thing.\n\nIn general I think not hiding what you are doing works better.  Just telling them you are observing lent, have given up alcohol and are only eating after 7:30 probably results in a few annoying questions as to why and then everyone moves on with their evening.\n\nI can see why you having a weird response of I didn\u2019t know we were going to dinner as the reason for not ordering dinner as getting weird looks from people you just met.\n\nBut your girlfriends reaction is way over the top, your actions caused no issues.  For a normal person at most her friends would ask her what\u2019s with the weird food thing and she\u2019ll say it\u2019s a catholic thing not a big deal.", "NTA and DTMFA. She is the only one who made this embarrassing. It\u2019s also incredibly shitty that she expects you to just\u2026not fast, for absolutely no valid reason at all. FWIW, I\u2019m an atheist and I still wouldn\u2019t treat someone this way even though I think a lot of religious practices are absurd.

As fellow person who celebrates Lent, if someone did this to me I would fast myself of them for the season. \n\nSeriously, what an intolerant, childish jerk. I am sorry you were treated this way. Don't compromise on this, because her behavior was way out of line - your politeness makes her look even worse. If she is going to treat your faith like that over this, do you believe she will respect other tenets of your faith going forward? You might want to consider the long-term viability of this relationship.\n\nHappy Lent, OP!", "NTA.\n\nI feel like there\u2019s some missing information because I cannot understand what she would be so upset about you not eating or drinking at the restaurant. That aside you still went with them and tried to make the night a good time enough though you were seemingly left out of the plans. I don\u2019t think you have anything to feel bad about. Some people are willing and wanting to compromise on their religious beliefs, and some aren\u2019t. Both are perfectly fine. But I think you should decide what you are willing and wanting to compromise on, if anything. Tell her these boundaries and that she should respect them.

Your gf is an AH.\nShe\u2019s embarrassed of you because you elected not to eat dinner at 4pm or drink an alcoholic beverage? Reasons why aren\u2019t even important, if that happened with a newcomer in my group of friends no one would even blink. What a ridiculous gripe for her to have. And to put it quit plainly for you OP, if she doesn\u2019t respect your religious practices now, she never will. If this is something of great importance to you I really suggest you think about whether this relationship is going to work out.

You didn\u2019t expect her or her friends to fast or give up drinking, you just wanted her to respect your choices. \n\nIt\u2019s also pretty rude to push some one to drink when they don\u2019t want to, I enjoy my booze but am on a \u2018dry Feb\u2019 break myself, other people don\u2019t drink for health, mental health or just don\u2019t like it reasons. \n\nAlthough, people with very different levels of religion do often have hard times building long term relationships.

I'm not sure why you didn't want to explain you were fasting but they all should have just dropped it when you said you weren't partaking.

That means you shouldn\u2019t be in a relationship with an unbeliever in the first place.

It seemed too much like another version of New Year's Resolutions, and I just...got sick of the lack of seriousness with which it was being approached by most people.

Nope.  You don't eat meat on Ash Wednesday, or Good Friday. During lent, you don't eat meat on Fridays. That's it. That is what Catholics mean by fasting.\n\nFasting as in not eating was done away with in 1940 or so.

So christianity.com puts it like this:\n\n> Lent is meant to be a time of repentance. That\u2019s not a feeling of shame but an awareness that sin separates us from God and of what it cost Him to be reunited with us. \u201cShame has its place, but feeling shame over sin is not the same thing as repentance from sin\u201d because \u201cour tempter can take our obedience to God and turn it into a source of pride.\u201d\n\nMay I ask what ANZAC day is?\n\nEdit: Oh, and yeah, it probably should be all year. BUT we're humans, we sin (make mistakes). That's why good Christians should go to confessions regularly. I mean, no matter how hard you try, you'll probably fuck up something anyways, even if you don't mean to. And that's probably also what lent is for - to recognise that.", "See those are the answers I kept getting when googling, which didn't quite answer why this is done through fasting and such. It's a gesture then right? Like giving up something is a gesture of repentance.\n\nOh haha, my bad. Australian and New Zealand Army Corp day. It's the anniversary of the soilders landing on Gallipoli. We do a dawn service and basically remember the sacrifice these soilders made in WWI. But I think mainstream we just celebrate all soldiers, not specifically the Gallipoli event.", "I'm not a religious scholar and haven't been religious for about two decades, so no guarantee that this is correct. It's only my take!\n\nMy mum always put it as: Others are struggling as well, and refraining from things we like during lent makes us aware of that. Jesus suffered for us, and we can feel a bit of that suffering if we give up on things we love. Which, I guess, is good enough for a kid.\n\nFor the repentance aspect, I guess, you have to be \"religious enough\" to regularly pray and reflect on your past behaviour. You have to be aware that your sins and treatment of others will reflect on you and your relationship with God. As a good Christian, you should want a good relationship with Him. And by taking the time of lent to actually reflect and repent, and use that time of ... renouncing worldly joys, of sacrificing, you can become a better Christian, improve your relationship with God, and maybe even refrain from repeating sins in the future.\n\nI think fasting during Ramadan is a bit similar. You take the time of that month to reflect on your own beliefs, on how you can improve your faith, on if you're a good person, improve your relationship with Allah.\n\nAs you said, of course it can (and probably should) be done all throughout the year. But society has changed, our lives have become more hectic and, at least where I live, less religiously influenced. We didn't have any meat on Fridays when I grew up, Friday was \"fish day\" in remembrance of Good Friday. My mum told me that she wasn't allowed breakfast before going to church on Sundays. I stopped going to confessions when I was about ten or so. I don't observe lent, because for me it wouldn't hold any religious or spiritual meaning at all.\n\nIf fasting is necessary for repenting? I don't know. But if it helps people, go ahead! :)\n\nI'm not sure if I can explain it correctly. I guess it's just one of those religious (and maybe even a bit cultural) things you just have to accept. Although I do understand that \"but why is Xyz done that way\" is necessary for understanding, for grasping something. (To be honest, it's one of the reasons why I stopped believing in what I was told as a kid - I couldn't get satisfying answers. So sorry if my answers are lacking!)\n\nThanks for that explanation! Didn't know it was a thing (as I'm from Europe), but it makes totally sense. :) It's probably a bit like the folks in Normandy celebrating and remembering D-Day.", "How did she \"ignore you for the whooooole ride home\" if the dinner place was next door?

I had a Catholic teacher and he would fast for Lent. It was the first I'd ever heard of it and asked him why and he educated me. I never thought it was strange and everyone is respectful.

You don't have to live with that. \n\nNot to say that mixed faith relationships can't work, because obviously there are countless couples who have the respect for one another to work these differences out.
