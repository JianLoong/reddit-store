That company sounds toxic.", "NTA  It's called \"paid time off\" not \"paid time sorta off but always on call though.\"\n\nThe only, and I mean only way to approach going is to make it clear any time in travel or attending a meeting will be paid. Any hours that should have been vacation and become work will be put back into your vacation bank.  \n\nReally you shouldn't be expected to do any work at all on your vacation.  People need a work life balance.  It sounds like you might want to start looking at other companies who treat their employees better.  Is there an HR you can report any of this to? To make sure you are getting paid for any time working.  It sounds almost harassing how much you're being bothered outside of work.", "NTA, I like the two options that other commenters have given. 1.

You took a leadership position at this company, which means you have the responsibility to lead, even when it's sometimes inconvenient for you. \n\nPresumably, you are salaried non-exempt. In cases such as these, modify your time card showing you were working on the day you were called in so you don't use PTO for the day. \n\nWelcome to leadership.

Whoop-de-do.\n\n> The business world doesn't stop just because OP is on vacation. \n\nNo. But anywhere that isn\u2019t a totally disorganised farce can function without one person for a week or two\u2026 and if they can\u2019t that is indicative of a serious problem with that business.

Your comment suggested you work IT at a financial institution. So I know you know this.\n\nOp didn't provide enough info in their original post, I was operating off the assumption that they are actually leadership at their company and have the power to assign duties. This is not the case, and OP is getting screwed. IF op was actually leadership, then their failure would not be \"wanting uninterrupted vacation\". The failure would be not setting up their department to succeed while they were away.\n\nYou hit the nail on the head in your comment, this shouldn't and wouldn't happen at a well lead and organized company. OP claimed to be leadership, which means they would be partially responsible for how well the company is lead and organized. Thats where OP would have failed. That has since been revealed to not be true.\n\nIt is not dystopian to hold yourself and your fellow leaders to a higher standard.\n\nIt is dystopian to hire an entry-level hourly employee, then tell them they are \"leadership\" then expect non paid work from them.

I had vacation booked months ago. My manager had to take time off unexpectedly. I worked a few hours each day of my PTO.

You can meet when you are back at work and not on vacation.", "Understaffed, disorganized, and based on OPs comments, potentially abusive.

Not only is it his earned benefit, but it is fucked up to expect him to give it up for free and not to mention the illegality of it in many many states. Even in at will employment states it can still be heavily restricted to make hourlies work like that on time off or outside of work hours.

For both of you. Only the morning meeting should be enough.\n\nAlso... NTA.. tell m you've got plans already. \"Sorry\"\n\nAlso... Charge for every phonecall!", "I guess I meant contact them about getting paid for all hours worked. The company doesn't want to end up with a lawsuit for not paying their employee. I've dealt with HR enough to know their goal is to protect the company, not the people.  They could be violating labor laws if OP is working unpaid hours.  OP should track all the time they're asked to work or are contracted outside of business hours.  And anything that might look like retaliation for not wanting to work 24/7.", "You're definitely NTA, but this is a tough call... while ideally, people should respect your boundaries, in reality, the people who are willing to sacrifice would get ahead. So it depends on what you want and how you see your future panning out. I left a very big multinational company that gave great benefits because I did not want that sort of life. It is really a personal decision. It depends on what the work culture is like in your country, can you realistically get away with not meeting up with your manager without a scratch? will there be any backlash? Can you handle it?"]}
