I got my PTO approved and made travel arrangements, but someone caught wind i will be there and they got travel approval for the other managers to go to the office.

I dont want to meet up with them despite never meeting them and i will be in the same town around the same time as them. \n2. I have never met them in person, and this provides the opportunity and they did initiate this trip knowing i would be there.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Is it legal?  I am not sure where you are and it might depend on your position.  I know my spouse works in IT mgmt and one of the things they enforce is when your off the clock your off the clock.  If anyone on PTO so much as logs in, there is hell to pay.  They have even gone as far as temporarily restricting access through the company website and email for those on a more extensive leave.  I would check with your state dept of labor.  Meanwhile don't answer any calls to your phone, if it's a work phone, turn it off.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As far as if it's legal, I'd suggest looking up your state's laws on working off the clock.", "NTA. That company sounds toxic.", "NTA  It's called \"paid time off\" not \"paid time sorta off but always on call though.\"\n\nThe only, and I mean only way to approach going is to make it clear any time in travel or attending a meeting will be paid. Any hours that should have been vacation and become work will be put back into your vacation bank.  \n\nReally you shouldn't be expected to do any work at all on your vacation.  People need a work life balance.  It sounds like you might want to start looking at other companies who treat their employees better.  Is there an HR you can report any of this to? To make sure you are getting paid for any time working.  It sounds almost harassing how much you're being bothered outside of work.", "NTA, I like the two options that other commenters have given. 1. Tell them you won\u2019t be in the area and don\u2019t respond to anything or give any indication you are reachable. 2. Make them pay you and give back your PTO. This means meals, travel, and actual pay."]}
