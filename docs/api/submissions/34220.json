If I literally saw my neighbor walk over to my door and take the bag I would go well that sucks I guess I\u2019ll make pasta. The police where I live would probably just call me back (definitely not show up) and lecture me on wasting time if I tried to get them to come out over delivery.", "If they\u2019re crazy enough to call the cops, they\u2019re probably crazy enough to go door to door knocking tbh.", "And their burgers aren't that great.", "Not surprising in the slightest.", "Her neighbour calling the cops was a waste of the cops' time and overreaction.", "I line in SF bay, cop would have laughed out hung up. They don\u2019t even stop thieves for under 1k.", "Yeah, if I remember correctly (I haven't had any of their food since I moved to this state.  They're here too, just far from my house now)...  But they basically stuff the fry bag/containers like a woman in a pornhub gangbang.  It was like you get at least 1/3 more fries than what it can actually hold and that shit is all up in that bag all loosey goosey.", "Have you ever ordered 5 guys? That bag of food was worth $50, at least. \n\n(OP IS STILL NTA)", "Exactly this! We have Uber Eats out here. Any issues I experience, I log with them. I do not even contact the store/restaurant it came from!\n\nIn my country thought the police don't even show up for serious crimes \ud83d\udc80\ud83e\udd23Its a joke that they only ever respond to domestic violence issues, because 'tea'\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nOur officers would probably have a field day laughing at this report, and tell her...'there are no vehicles right now'...", "With THEIR hand?", "If it had a name that you didn\u2019t recognize and the order, you/husband should\u2019ve just left it outside. You knew it didn\u2019t belong to you. What your neighbor did was overboard though.", "[You caught me](https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.97ko8I4JPz75pqh8xviQEQHaFO?pid=ImgDetMain)", "Right??? The cops won\u2019t even show up in my area if there isn\u2019t a violent crime in progress when you call. They tell you to make an online report instead.", "You don't find it funny they arrived in 10 minutes? I could get shot and they wouldnt get there that fast.", "This woman sounds like the type that flat out lied probably claimed they assaulted her when she came looking for the food", "Like everyone else they're probably keen on the overtime to get through Janu-worry\n\nSeems like a good time to get your petty neighbor disputes sorted too :p", "Or she made up some wild complaint.", "The story is fake", "This occurred in Mayberry \ud83d\ude02", "She told the cops that OP took the food off her porch because that\u2019s the only way they would come.", "Until you have too many claims for non delivery, yes.", "Still doesn\u2019t matter, it was an honest mistake and if none of the individual items was opened it should still be perfectly good to eat.\n\nShe just seems butthurt about it.", "You should have a whole other thread.", "Oh it's not exclusively a white rich people shit. A lot of entitled or mentally unstable people of all colors of the crayon box really like to call the cops for absolutely no good reasons. \n\nI've seen a woman call the cops on a cashier because she wanted free gas at a gas station one time.", "As a former 911 dispatcher where people calling routinely had to be placed on hold for minutes at a time I am dumbfounded about this.", "My friend was laughing 'to loud' in the evening and a neighbour called the cops. They came to her door \ud83e\udd23\n\nJust one hard laugh. Not the whole evening. She explained the situation and they got back", "In my city the cops don't show up even if someone is actively trying to break into your house.", "Seriously, in Atlanta I called the police because a man was literally breaking into our house through a window, and they sent someone around the next morning\u2026", "He is the one true threat to society tbh.", "Yep. Doordash doesn't tell you where the food was accidently delivered and no police is going to someone's house for accidentally delivered food.", "Yeah, I used to live in a town that was small enough that the local paper printed police calls.  People will call in very small incidents, even though police will not go out to everything.  I'm surprised the police responded in this case.", "GrubHub", "I chatted with them the night of. I chatted with them a few days later. I emailed them. I submitted a dispute to my CC. None of it mattered.", "Never call the cops for a cat in a tree.

Police came to our door after we already turned it down (we never kept blasting it after 10). Neighbors didn't even try to talk to us. We lived on the top level and there wasn't an elevator so the cops were probably not amused. A few months later some guys moved in at the ground level, they were in a metal band and practiced in our building, the neighbors in between us must have been furious\ud83d\ude05.", "Yes and no. They take pictures of the final delivery. I\u2019ve ordered food for my gf at her apartment and they routinely confuse her neighbors address for hers (even with specific instructions) my gf doesn\u2019t have a door mat but her neighbors do and once we see the doormat in the final delivery picture we have to run over and grab it.", "Except.... neighbor knows exactly where the food was? So... neighbor told the police, not DoorDash...?\n\nThe lack of reading comprehension these days.", "No but you can often tell by the photo of where it was left. I know all my neighbors\u2019 porches by now between the various delivery services making mistakes. We\u2019re all quite friendly though, no one calls the police.", "It's more that it doesn't have an address on it typically so you don't know where it's supposed to go. I always turn it away of course if it's not mine. Mail you can just put wrong address and they will fix it the next day typically. If it's my neighbors I'll always walk it to them though.", "I thought cats in a tree were the fire departments responsibility??", "Not only that, but it could become a food safety issue from sitting at room temperature for an unknown period of time.", "The name and receipt is on the bag. Thats why you read before opening things.", "Yeah, that's not the point I thought you were making... Oops!", "I got the cops called on me for letting my almost one year old baby cry herself to sleep. My dr said to let me cry for 15 min then get her if she didn\u2019t stop. She lasted 13 min. 4 hours later the cops show up about a crying baby. It was 11:30 at night and I was asleep. Told them what happened, asked if they wanted to check the baby. They said no and left. 4 hours is a long time if I had really done something to my daughter. They didn\u2019t even check.", "Your reading comprehension and/or logical thinking is a bit lacking too, I'm afraid. It's clear, from context, what they meant. They did NOT say that DoorDash told the police where the food was!", ">Doordash doesn't tell you where the food was accidently delivered\n\nUm... I think you need to look in the mirror a little. I was responding to dadthewisest.", "I know. Let's look closer at his comment\n\n\\> Doordash doesn't tell you where the food was accidently delivered \n\nand \n\n\\> no police is going to someone's house for accidentally delivered food.\r  \n\r  \nThere are two assertions there. It does NOT say \"DoorDash told the police where the food was\", which apparently you thought he said.\n\nIt's clear (to me) from dadthewisest's comment he understands the OP thinks that DD told the customer, and the customer called the police.\n\nYou then replied to him grumpily, I'm just attempting to put you back in your box.\n\nAnyway yeah the whole thing is fake :)", "I wasn't grumpy. Still not. Still think you're wrong, but meh, whatever."]}
