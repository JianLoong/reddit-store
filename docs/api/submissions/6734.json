Fair warning, this post touches on some toilet topics.\n\nI (25F) am married to \u201cJacob\u201d (24M). Last weekend we were going to visit my MIL \u201cJen\u201d for New Years. We were going to drive up two hours on Saturday, stay the night, and drive home Sunday.\n\nHowever, on Friday night I wanted to order pizza with \u201cthe works\u201d and watch a movie. Note that I have IBS and dairy, peppers, and onion are some of my triggers.

I ordered a pizza to arrive once Jacob got home, put some beers on the fridge to chill, and picked a movie.\n\nJacob and I had a nice relaxing night, but I woke up at 1 AM with awful abdominal cramps. I was in the bathroom til 4, and I realized there\u2019d be no way I could sit through a road trip in the morning. I woke Jake up to tell him the news, and at first he was nice, getting me imodium and water, running the shower etc. But later that morning when he was packing up the car alone, he got pissy.\n\nHe accused me of basically poisoning myself to get out of seeing his mom. That isn\u2019t true \u2014 I just felt like I deserved pizza after a hard week and didn\u2019t really cross my mind. I don\u2019t like Jen to be fair; she\u2019s constantly fucking up her own life for dumb reasons, and then she calls Jake to clean up her messes. For this reason, Jake didn\u2019t believe me, and he left still mad.\n\nHe\u2019s been working 24/7 since he got back from his mom\u2019s (he ended up returning on the 3rd), so we haven\u2019t had an in depth discussion.

You knew what you were doing. YTA, you owe him an apology.", "YTA.  It kinda sounds like you do smaller version of what you say Jen does.  You made yourself sick, \u201cmessing up your life\u201d because you absolutely had to treat yourself that specific day, and then wanted Jake to clean up your mess, take care of you, and smile and nod and pretend you weren\u2019t selfish.

But you knew what you were doing. \n\nAs for the whole \u201che seems to think I owe him an apology for being sick.\u201d   You weren\u2019t sick with a sudden illness.  You weren\u2019t up with the flu or food poisoning.  You knew this reaction could happen.  You knew you\u2019d get sick.  You knew you\u2019d need help.  And you likely knew he\u2019d be running around helping you out.  You knew you had a trip that weekend.  You made a choice to treat yourself - thinking about yourself.  That was selfish.  Jacob recognizes the selfishness in the action.  You do owe him an apology.  Everything that happens was in your control, and the result of your decisions.", "YTA. He\u2019s right, you poisoned yourself to avoid his mother.", "YTA. And selfish. You have IBS. You know your triggers. You knew that you had a scheduled trip. Your husband knows you don't care for his mother. You purposely sabotaged yourself to avoid going and now you want him to act like everything is A-OK. You're not only a selfish asshole, but an immature one.\n\nIt's one thing had you eaten something and developed food poisoning. Or even had something that flat out disagreed with you and made you miserable. But you ***weaponized your medical condition*** to your advantage to get out a trip you didn't want to go on. You couldn't be an adult and use your words to tell your husband that you'd like a pass on this one.\n\nSelfish, immature, manipulative....I don't see this marriage lasting long, as who's to say you won't pull this asinine stunt again to get out of something you don't want to do.\n\nETA: a word", "YTA!  You absolutely did do it on purpose, \u201cshe\u2019s constantly fucking up her own life for dumb reasons, and then calls Jake to clean up her messes\u201d\n\nAre you talking about yourself, OP?", "YTA. You knew what the outcome of your actions would be and did it anyway. What else would you be but TA?

Whether you did it \u201con purpose\u201d to get out of the trip or not, you made a bad choice on purpose.  You know your triggers and ate them anyway and it meant your boyfriend had to make the trip alone.  So you ought to apologize even though it wasn\u2019t that you intended to skip the trip - that was still the result and your actions caused it.  I do feel for you as IBS does not sound like fun at all.  But if you want to cheat and take the consequences (I have a friend who does this with her dairy issues), you need to choose strategically.", "Lolol. As someone who's getting treated for IBS. Knows the exact outcome of eating your trigger foods and how it can put a pause on your life. I find it so hard to believe that you ate not one, not two but three of your trigger foods before a planned trip to visit a person you think so, so, sooo poorly of and it was all an unfortunate coincidence.\n\nYTA.", "YTA I wouldn\u2019t see a long-term future with someone that acted like you tbh.

So you ordered a pizza with 3 food triggers on it.  I get you had a crappy week and wanted a treat.  You could have found something else that satisfied a nice treat without literally causing you intestinal distress.\n\nI get it I have stomach issues too.  It\u2019s a roll of the dice if something will upset my stomach sometimes.  Do you know what I do??  I **dont** eat those foods the night before an important trip.", "YTA. \n\nYou're so childish and immature I can't believe he isn't seeing this side of you and choosing to leave. \"I just feel I deserve a pizza\", are you 12? \n\nSo you're typically good about following doctor's orders...except when you don't like Jen and would rather not go visit her. I bet if you were going to someone you had wanted to see that you would have eaten right for the big trip you knew was planned.", "YTA. You \"didn't\" do it on purpose? Sure thing. Keep telling yourself that. I don't believe it and I'm sure \"Jacob\" doesn't.", "YTA. You prioritized pizza over a trip that was important to your partner.\n\nWould you have risked it for a trip with your own family?", "YTA. I get severe migraines and know my triggers. If I were to eat any of them before an event, I would absolutely know the consequences so therefore it would be a choice. You knew.", "YTA. You did it on purpose. Stop lying.", "YTA\n\nYou knew you had a road trip the next morning and ate something that you know you\u2019d have stomach issues with.", "YTA. You knew what was happening tomorrow.", "YTA  I have a similar problem and know that if I eat wrong I'm gonna end up sick.  Say you're sorry and get on with life.", "Slight YTA. I realize that you wanted a treat, but you ate that knowing that it would upset your stomach and trigger the IBS. You know that, Jake knows that. You also knew that you planned a trip. That's why he feels like you did it on purpose. \n\nThat fact that you don't like your MIL makes it seem a whole lot more intentional.", "YTA. I thought this was food poisoning or something. Yes it's fine to treat yourself with food you enjoy. But if you know that food gives you a reaction and you have a commitment the next day, it 100% looks like you did it to deliberately get out of that commitment. If you were going to eat that trigger food, knowing how it would affect you, you should of been ready to either power through or just have the pizza after.", "YTA. \"She is constantly fucking up her own life for dumb reasons\" on the plus side, it sounds like you and Jen have more in common than you think, lol. \n\nUsually I might side with the person who has IBD because you can't always plan for that sort of thing, however, you specifically knew what your triggers were in this case, knew when your trip was supposed to be, and still decided to have a pizza made with SEVERAL of your trigger foods. It does seem pretty dang intentional OP, and I can see why your partner is upset. Even if accidental, the lack of good judgemental here still makes YTA. \n\nYour partner definitely deserves an apology but only offer one if you actually mean it, and provide a solution to avoid this from happening again in the future, and actually follow through. It's fine to have cheat days when the only person you're affecting is yourself, but this was outright self-sabotaging to avoid a situation you didn't want to be in. \n\nThat being said, if you'd rather have explosive miserable bowel movements for hours on end than to see your MiL, maybe it's time to talk to your partner about why that is, if the relationship between you and MiL is fixable, what your partner can do to make you more comfortable, or if there needs to be more distance between certain family members?", "Yes, YTA. Your claim that it wouldn't cross your mind that you'd get sick and not be able to go on a trip you really didn't want to go on, is very suspect.", "YTA and your relationship with food is really fucked up if you see a food likely to give you 24 hours of pain as \u201ca treat.\u201d", "YTA. If you are that good sensitive and know you have a car trip, you eat the 10% of food when you get home.", "YTA.\n\nMy mom has IBS so I totally understand the frustration but\u2026don\u2019t eat trigger foods when you know you\u2019re going to be taking a long car ride. This 100% could have been avoided and you could have had the pizza another night.", "YTA. Why act like a child when you don't want to go somewhere?", "YTA. You knew what the result of eating that meal would be.", "I have IBS and I\u2019m lactose intolerant. If I know I have something planned I would not eat my trigger foods. YTA", "So, basically, your husband married his own mother. It is kind of fucked up that you would eat something to trigger your own illness as a way to avoid a trip to see MIL. \n\nNobody just \"forgets\" triggers to illnesses, especially when they cause extreme discomfort... You're such an AH.", "YTA, grow up. You pole vaulted into the find out stage (you knew what would happen and still you did the wrong thing like a child with no functioning frontal lobe)\n\nIf I were dating you and you did that I don\u2019t think I would stick around for another round of you could have made a different choice and you didn\u2019t.", "Yta, you claim that IBS has taken time away from your life, implying you are not happy about that.

As a functioning adult, I\u2019ve learned to control as much of my issues as I can.  Shit still happens (pun intended) but at least I\u2019m not making myself sick. \n\nIf dairy is an issue, look at alternatives (many pizza restaurants offer vegan cheese options) or take a lactose pill.  If you have to avoid onions and peppers, so be it, sometimes life sucks.  \n\nYou didn\u2019t take your husband into consideration at all, you were very selfish, even before the road trip was factored in.  Grow up.  You sound 15, whining about how you deserve a pizza.  FFS.  No one should be punished for your failure to manage your illness.  Which you may be making worse (all that extra inflammation!) every time you overload your system with trigger foods.  \n\nNo wonder you have issues with your mother in law, I\u2019m guessing this attitude bleeds over into other areas of your life.", "I have GERD and know what will irritate my stomach, as apparently do you.\n\nI don't know if you were just making a stupid decision, but you fucked your friend over with that one. If I'm travelling or have plans, I basically have to prep by having a super safe diet to avoid those issues. \n\nAlso, it's not that you owe him an apology for being sick. It's not like you got food poisoning randomly or anything. You knew this would happen. Are you thick in the head?\n\nYTA", "YTA. I\u2019ve had gastro issues since I was a child. I literally ate the BRAT diet out of my lunchbox at school every day when I was 12. My doctors have put me on some of the strictest elimination diets out there, so I completely understand feeling depressed and wanting to cheat with some trigger foods. But you have to be an adult and time those carefully. You know better than to eat multiple trigger foods the night before a trip. You wouldn\u2019t risk losing your job by eating a pizza with the works the night before a big presentation or meeting would you? Of course not, so why would you do this right before something important to your husband? He\u2019s right to feel hurt and angry. You owe him a major apology and you owe it to both of you to learn some self-control and start taking responsibility for your actions.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t get sick, you poisoned yourself.  You either did it knowingly to get out of seeing your MIL or you did it selfishly because you wanted pizza and that was more important than anything or anyone else, regardless of the predictable consequences.", "Yea YTA like I get all the treat yourself stuff I'm sure you deserve it we all do but that's so rude like someone has planned for you and is expecting you and you flaked because of something that was totally within your control. Should have just waited a week for the pizza", "YTA", "YTA. I have IBS too. Take a lactaid or Imodium. Better yet why wouldn\u2019t you just wait til after the trip?

I can eat like one percent of what is in the grocery store. \n\nI hate when I misread a label and get sick from dairy or high fat content in food.  \n\nI hate the painful cramps. I hate the toilet time. I hate all of it. \n\nI can't see how that makes a bad week better.", "YTA.

You knew darn well what you were doing.", "YTA \nAs someone who has a garlic intolerance, which is in literally everything in the US besides desserts, I understand. Sometimes the thing that will make you sick is so tempting, and you do deserve to be able to make that decision on when you get to eat your trigger foods.

You say it didn\u2019t really cross your mind, and it should have. You should be able to think ahead 24 hours and consider your boyfriends feelings.\nYour little segment on Jen was unnecessary and it kind of proves that you would do something like this on purpose.

Your choices are not only selfish, they are self defeating.", "Very small AH, I have IBS as well and it sucks. It took me years to get my IBS under control. It\u2019s really hard having to adjust your diet and mindset but it\u2019s necessary to improve your quality of life.

I know what it\u2019s like to have a craving and want what you want. But given what you had planned the next day, eating pizza wasn\u2019t a good idea. The thing with IBS is that you\u2019re pretty much playing Russian Roulette when you eat food that triggers you. Sometimes it\u2019s not too bad, just a little gas. Other times it\u2019s coming out of both ends and you feel like you\u2019re dying. Personally, I never take risks outside the house and before important events\u2026.it\u2019s just not worth it.

If/when it does flare up my IBS, is it WORTH it?\" And sometimes they'll take the misery for the joy and dopamine of delicious food.\n\nMost likely, everyone in the comments section who is judging you and calling you TA has never dealt with dietary restrictions in their life (at most, lactose intolerance probably), nor a chronic condition.

I believe you that you didn\u2019t do this as a way to get out of the trip even tho it was a dumb choice. Still, I think it\u2019s a good idea to apologize because you both need to move forward.

Getting sick is something you could reasonably say a young child does to get out of a trip, but not an adult. You had a treat after a hard week, you weren't thinking about any trips. He greatly overreacted.", "NTA. I don't have IBS, but I'm lactose intolerant. I LOVE pizza, but dairy free cheese is not the best tasting, so when I get pizza, I go for the real cheese. Every once in awhile I get a craving or use it as a comfort food after a stressful week, so I completely understand you wanting some pizza. I feel like your husband over-reacted a bit.", "NAT\n\nPeople are so dumb in the replies. Op had the condition their whole life and know their limits. Sometimes your body just doesnt cooperate.

It\u2019s an incredibly unhealthy relationship with food and essentially weaponising a medical condition to control people around you is straying into abuse territory. You made him and others clean up after your poor decision and deliberate choice. \n\nThat shit gets old fast. Also triggering your IBS just makes you sicker. It is self harm. You need to either understand why you are using your health to hurt people or seek therapy for what may be an eating disorder.
