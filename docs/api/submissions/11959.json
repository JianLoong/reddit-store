My MIL did not take my concerns very well and became very defensive. She told my husband that we were terrible house guests and that I left toys all over their vacation home. She said that we ruined their vacation and told my husband that I am messy and don\u2019t clean up after the kids. I will admit that the kids did have toys around the house, but I was trying to do my best with cleaning up after the kids by myself while also caring for a baby and before we left to go home I made sure that everything we used was spotless and had been put away. \n\nI was really hurt by the things that MIL said about me and VERY concerned that she didn\u2019t think her husband\u2019s jokes were inappropriate.

MIL lives over two hours away, so I admit that it is a long drive for her to just come and spend a few hours with the kids, but she also has other family in the area and I think that she should stay with them instead.
