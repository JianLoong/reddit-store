My relationship with my MIL become very strained after we went on vacation with her and her husband (husband\u2019s stepfather) a few years ago. During the vacation, her husband kept making inappropriate \u201cjokes\u201d about the women having to listen to the men or they would get hit. I have daughters and so this made me really uncomfortable. As a woman raising women of the future, I don\u2019t want to normalize the idea that women need to be subservient to their husbands. I spoke to my husband about this and he told me that I should address it with his mom. \n\nI sent his mother a message about my concerns in a very respectful manner and asked if she could talk to her husband about not making \u201cjokes\u201d like that in front of the children (age 5 & 1 at that time). My MIL did not take my concerns very well and became very defensive. She told my husband that we were terrible house guests and that I left toys all over their vacation home. She said that we ruined their vacation and told my husband that I am messy and don\u2019t clean up after the kids. I will admit that the kids did have toys around the house, but I was trying to do my best with cleaning up after the kids by myself while also caring for a baby and before we left to go home I made sure that everything we used was spotless and had been put away. \n\nI was really hurt by the things that MIL said about me and VERY concerned that she didn\u2019t think her husband\u2019s jokes were inappropriate. Since then, my relationship with MIL has gotten even worse. Throughout the pandemic, she refused to follow public health recommendations and since I have an underlying health condition, I did not feel safe around her any longer. \n\nDuring the pandemic we stopped allowing overnight guests because of my health issues. So before the new baby was born, my husband and his mother had a conversation about her wanting to come over to our house a few times a month and spending a few nights at our house so that she could see the children. I outright refused the idea and it has caused a lot of problems between my husband and I. My husband says that I am stopping his mother from having a relationship with our children because I don\u2019t like her. My husband says that I am living in the past and that I should move on because I am making other people unhappy. MIL lives over two hours away, so I admit that it is a long drive for her to just come and spend a few hours with the kids, but she also has other family in the area and I think that she should stay with them instead. My husband is insisting that I am the asshole because his mother is willing to work on the relationship and I am just being a bad person by not forgiving all of the hurtful things that she has said in the past. \n\nAm I being the asshole for not wanting my MIL to spend the night at our house if she has other family that she can stay with?", "created_utc": 1678462297, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ns7g9/aita_for_not_letting_my_mil_spend_the_night_at/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It does sound like your conflict with your MIL is harming your relationship with your husband.

If your MIL is undermining you and making you uncomfortable, you do not need that in you or your kids lives.  \n\nI understand your husband's desires to have his mom come and be a part of his kids life, but he also needs to understand that your children are information sponges right now and he needs to make sure that he knows how he wants his kids raised.  \n\nThere is a possibility that you and your husband come up with a compromise on when his mother interacts with your kids, but you BOTH need to agree.   \n\nSet a boundary.

She has not asked to visit for the sake of talking with OP, she wants to spend time with the kids. She's never acknowledged that OP's concerns about her husband are valid, or apologized for saying unkind things about her. My guess is also that during these visits she makes life harder by assuming that all parental responsibilities are on OP and not her son.\n\nI would compromise by offering to split the cost of a hotel, and proposing a meal alone together if she truly wants to repair the relationship.

It shouldn't be that you have to breach your boundaries or forgive bad behavior which will continue since she is obviously not repentant.", "NTA. Your MIL isn't wanting to \"work on the relationship\" like your husband seems to think. Working on the relationship would include apologies and discussions on what to do differently in the future.  MIL's idea of \"working on the relationship\" is to just rug-sweep all the crap she's done in the past, take no accountability for her actions, and just allow her to continue to do whatever the heck she wants and ignore your boundaries.

Your MIL has made it clear on multiple occasions that your values, your comfort, and even your safety are not important to her.  You\u2019re not keeping her from having a relationship with your children, you\u2019re limiting the amount of time you are responsible for dealing with a woman who disregards your needs.

While I agree the father-in-law shouldn\u2019t make jokes about domestic abuse, and you have every right to voice your concern, you\u2019re in-laws relationship is their own and their humor amongst each other seems to be on another level which you aren\u2019t willing to tolerate.

Your husband needs to grow a backbone and understand that his mother is the reason the relationship is the way it is AND that you\u2019re not going to be walked all over, nor should you.
