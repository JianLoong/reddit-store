She let mold grow on her dishes once bc she didn\u2019t want to wash them. she even came up w the rule that we should buy and cook for ourselves yet constantly eats and uses our stuff.\n\n2. \ufeff\ufeff\ufeffShe would have people over and never tell us no matter how many times we told her to + they would make messes she didn\u2019t clean\n\n3. \ufeff\ufeff\ufeffDue to gf and I having some trauma regarding people in our house at night, we said we needed at least notice if someone were to stay the night. She agreed yet we never received any notice or warning.

I just ignored and began preparing dinner. When I was finished, I served gf and I with little left. Then RM came over, looked at the pot, then said, \"Is there more left for Me and SS?\" \nMe: Uhh no. I didn't make you any. \n\nHer: But me and SS are soooooo hungry please?? Can\u2019t you make more?\u201d\n\nMe: There isn\u2019t more.

I haven't cooked for you since we first moved in. If you want to eat, you can cook something yourself.\n\nIt's important to note that RM came from a higher class family who had maids, and always catered food and ate out. She doesn't know how to do anything and expects us to clean up after her.\n\nRM: But I don't need to cook if you're here already doing it. I don't really get why you won't just make more or at least make us something else. It\u2019s easy.\n\nSS decides to pipe in, saying \u201cIt's kind of rude to cook for yourself when you have a guest over anyway.\u201d RM repeated it.\n\nMe: What guest? You didn't say anyone was coming over, so as far as l'm concerned, you and I are the only people here. you never help with groceries and I shouldn't have to feed you because you\u2019re an adult and can feed yourself\n\nShe gets mad and both of them call me an AH before leaving. RM messaged in our group chat later that night saying I was terrible. Now she\u2019s vague posting on twt about it, and her friends are calling me a bitch. RM wants me to apologize and even posted a tally on her twt of days I haven't apologized to her. I don't think I should, bc I don't think I did anything wrong. Maybe rude, but not wrong.
