The party was for a different family event. \n      Anyways he called and was yelling about I should have called him. He could have had someone take us around until he got there blah blah. This is not the first event he has had me show up to alone. I met his parents by myself after he said he was coming and then never showed up. So I was expecting he was pulling the same bull when I had the kids. He hung up and refused to talk to me or tell me the location of the other party.\n     Fast forward to this weekend I start to miscarry. He is currently out of town partying. I had to tell him over text what was happening because he still refused to answer the phone. He said well it can't be mines so I'll talk to you when I ready to deal with this. And that's all I want to say to you. \n     I feeling this relationship is over. This situation is ridiculous and hurtful.

I am sorry that you underwent a miscarriage, but I don't think it's worth bringing in another child in the world with this guy as a father.

You almost brought another baby into this toxic abusive mess. Please focus on your kids and.not getting some dude. Do you have family? You need to file to child support and get a visitation schedule worked out but tbh he sounds like a deadbeat so idk how much he'll see the kids. He's def banging a bunch of other chicks tho. Why you have allowed you and your kids to be treated like a joke is beyond me. Seek out some emotional support to help.

My advice to you is to use more discernment when deciding to bring kids into the world with an inconsiderate,  irresponsible AH.  You have 3 kids between the two of you and have/had one on the way, and you don't live together and are not married.  He has a pattern of behavior of leaving you alone in these situations, and he obviously sees nothing wrong with children being up at all hours of the night while he is nowhere to be found.

You\u2019re an asshole to your children if you continue to see him. Your kids deserve at least one parent who isn\u2019t a complete waste and who has some dignity and self respect. Condoms are a lot cheaper than kids, and this guy is never going to pay you child support. Wear a fucking condom, have your tubes tied, dump the loser, and get your shit together.", "NTA. This guy is NOT relationship material, he is NOT father material. He is immature, selfish and totally lacking in EVERY worthwhile personality trait that you would want in a relationship.
