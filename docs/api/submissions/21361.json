This is not the first event he has had me show up to alone. I met his parents by myself after he said he was coming and then never showed up.

And that's all I want to say to you. \n     I feeling this relationship is over. This situation is ridiculous and hurtful.

I am sorry that you underwent a miscarriage, but I don't think it's worth bringing in another child in the world with this guy as a father.

You almost brought another baby into this toxic abusive mess. Please focus on your kids and.not getting some dude. Do you have family? You need to file to child support and get a visitation schedule worked out but tbh he sounds like a deadbeat so idk how much he'll see the kids. He's def banging a bunch of other chicks tho. Why you have allowed you and your kids to be treated like a joke is beyond me. Seek out some emotional support to help.
