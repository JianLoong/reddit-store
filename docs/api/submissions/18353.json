I got pregnant with my first baby at 17 and moved in with my husband and his family at 18. My daughter looks a lot like me, and people have always commented on how similar we look. My mother in law has always supported me and has been such a huge help with the kids.\n\nI am half asian  (My father was Japanese and Korean mix) yet many people have no idea until i tell them as I am white passing. I have always introduced myself as a European because I am not in touch with my asian heritage, and also because my father is not part of my life anymore and I don't like to talk about him. My mother in law knows this and my race thank fully isn't important to her.\n\nHowever, as my daughter is getting older is it getting very clear she is part asian. She has small, sharp eyes and tan skin. Of course, she is beautiful and nothing about her looks worries us since we knew there would be a chance her asian genes would \"shine through\" however my mother in law has commented a few times that she might not be my husbands as before him I always had a thing for asian men.\n\nAbout a week ago, my mother in law made a large dinner and invited us over to eat. She sat our entire family (children included) down at the dining table and asked if we would be able to do a paternity test to find out about my daughters heritage. I told my mother in law that she was part Korean, part Japanese and part german thinking nothing of it, but my mother in law asked me if I was sure and then said my daughter looks \"too Chinese.\" I was shocked and asked my mother in law what she meant, and it was then my mother in law told me that she didn't think the baby was my husbands and that she wanted to do a DNA test to make sure.\n\nShe said this right in front of my daughter who is smart enough to know what is going on, and immediately started asking questions. I was furious and called out my mother in law for being rude and embarrassing me and then told her I has nothing to prove and if she didn't think her granddaughter was hers she didn't have to be in her life.\n\nMy husband and I left straight away and have not contacted her since, but my father in law has been coming to our door, telling us we overreacted and if I would just take the test this would all be over but I feel that would affect my pride as not just a person, but as a wife and mother.\n\nSo, Am I the asshole?\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nI would just like people to know that although my Mother in law has been very harsh recently, throughout my time with her she has been very kind and loving and please only judge her as what is happening here (overall she is a great person). Also she is NOT a racist and the problem is not because she is  un-happy with me or my daughters race.", "created_utc": 1685254827, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13tt56q/aita_for_refusing_to_do_a_paternity_test/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is INSANE, especially five years later to be asking that of you.\n\nI am so so glad your husband isn't part of this racist crap.  How embarrassing for him to have his parents act like that.\n\nThat she did this in front of your daughter is almost unforgivable.", "Arrrgh!!! So much NTA!!! MiL and FiL, however, are gaping As. I am so sorry they are doing this. It is good your husband is on your side in this.

For years she kept it up. Finally after years and years of her harassment the husband started believing it too. Him and his mom did a paternity test behind her back and guess what, he IS the dad. He was so happy with the results that he showed her thinking she would be happy too. And then my friend served him with divorce papers because he didn\u2019t trust her, went behind her back and involved their teenage son. It was complete betrayal. NTA", "Wow, no, NTA.  The fact that they can't see that these accusation are  relationship ending is nuts.   I'd let her know that you're willing, but the notification that her insulting accusations are incorrect will be the last contact.", "NTA\n\nYour in-laws are weird.\n\nI don\u2019t think you should take the paternity test, just because it would set a precedent and what crazy thing would they ask for next?\n\nI don\u2019t think your in-laws like you as much as you think.", "NTA. It's pretty common for traits to skip a generation and resurface in the grandkids. Your MIL basically accused you with infidelity with her only evidence being poor understanding of genetics and racism. Personally, I would take the test just to rub it under her nose for the rest of her life, but honestly, as long as your husband trusts you, it's completely fine to refuse a test you feel would humiliate you.", "NTA and I\u2019m glad your husband is with you on this", "Does your husband look like his father?

If your husband has a question he can discuss it with you alone!", "NTA You\u2019re MIL and FIL are though. This request was outrageous in itself, but to address this in front of your daughter is so so awful.

Whaaaaat the fuck. I'd be very happy never talking to this woman again.", "NTA, that's obvs your MIL, but a couple of things things:\n\n1. Please stop saying you're \"European\" because you're white passing. It's really going to bite you when you daughter asks why you're ashamed to be Asian (even if you don't think you are). How are you going to explain that she is Asian and her grandfather was Asian but you're somehow not because you are white passing? \n\n2. Your MIL obviously cares about race, but you allowed her not to by being \"European.\" She doesn't see you as Asian because you never made her. She expected your baby to look like you and her son and was shocked that the dormant genes were hitting. She's mad because her granddaughter looks more ethnic than she thinks is desirable. You're not to blame for her ignorance and racism, but you did co-sign it by othering yourself. \n\nI'm glad you stood up to her and that your husband supported you. Don't take that DNA test and don't let that woman around your child without her sincere apology and proof that she's doing the work to be anti-racist. If she said that in front of your face and child, imagine what  she'd say if you weren't around.", "NTA.

Stand your ground with the both of them. Their accusation is entirely uncalled for and it\u2019s rude AF to insinuate infidelity when your daughter clearly either just inherited more of your Asian heritage or the features are just more prevalent.", "NTA.
