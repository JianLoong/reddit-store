My mother in law has always supported me and has been such a huge help with the kids.\n\nI am half asian  (My father was Japanese and Korean mix) yet many people have no idea until i tell them as I am white passing. I have always introduced myself as a European because I am not in touch with my asian heritage, and also because my father is not part of my life anymore and I don't like to talk about him. My mother in law knows this and my race thank fully isn't important to her.\n\nHowever, as my daughter is getting older is it getting very clear she is part asian. She has small, sharp eyes and tan skin. Of course, she is beautiful and nothing about her looks worries us since we knew there would be a chance her asian genes would \"shine through\" however my mother in law has commented a few times that she might not be my husbands as before him I always had a thing for asian men.\n\nAbout a week ago, my mother in law made a large dinner and invited us over to eat. She sat our entire family (children included) down at the dining table and asked if we would be able to do a paternity test to find out about my daughters heritage. I told my mother in law that she was part Korean, part Japanese and part german thinking nothing of it, but my mother in law asked me if I was sure and then said my daughter looks \"too Chinese.\" I was shocked and asked my mother in law what she meant, and it was then my mother in law told me that she didn't think the baby was my husbands and that she wanted to do a DNA test to make sure.\n\nShe said this right in front of my daughter who is smart enough to know what is going on, and immediately started asking questions. I was furious and called out my mother in law for being rude and embarrassing me and then told her I has nothing to prove and if she didn't think her granddaughter was hers she didn't have to be in her life.\n\nMy husband and I left straight away and have not contacted her since, but my father in law has been coming to our door, telling us we overreacted and if I would just take the test this would all be over but I feel that would affect my pride as not just a person, but as a wife and mother.\n\nSo, Am I the asshole?\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nI would just like people to know that although my Mother in law has been very harsh recently, throughout my time with her she has been very kind and loving and please only judge her as what is happening here (overall she is a great person).

How are you going to explain that she is Asian and her grandfather was Asian but you're somehow not because you are white passing? \n\n2. Your MIL obviously cares about race, but you allowed her not to by being \"European.\" She doesn't see you as Asian because you never made her. She expected your baby to look like you and her son and was shocked that the dormant genes were hitting. She's mad because her granddaughter looks more ethnic than she thinks is desirable. You're not to blame for her ignorance and racism, but you did co-sign it by othering yourself. \n\nI'm glad you stood up to her and that your husband supported you.
