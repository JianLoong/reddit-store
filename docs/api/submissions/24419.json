You remind me exactly of a friend I have that often cancels shit last minute, gets into messy situations and then blames everything else. However, your friends aren\u2019t too great either, if I was them, I would ask you to pay a smaller portion, sit you down and tell you why you had to pay, which is that the others relied on your share to bring the collective price down. For example, I play for a sports league and last season someone got injured the first game and didn\u2019t show up for the entire season, he still had to pay his team registration portion as he was technically taking up space in the roster and our cost calculation was distributed evenly among all. We also couldn\u2019t get someone else in as the season had already started. He, unlike you , understood this and was more than willing to pay the full share even though we asked him to pay a discounted fee.", "YTA You didn't go, we get that. Problem is you agreed to go and backed out last minute, whether your choice or not that's what happened. Everyone had an expectation of price as a result of who agreed to go and some might have done stuff differently if the price was different because the total was different. Now your argument to that is likely going to be\"they wouldn't have\" but that's not yours to guess. If you cancelled with months or even weeks notice, that'd be one thing but doing it the day before makes you the ah. \n\nIf everyone operated like you no one would want to go on trips like this because it'd be too risky with people not keeping their word and others getting sacked with bigger bills than they expected( truthfully, guy organizing should have made everyone pay for accommodation in advance, that's what I've always seen to avoid something like this  from happening). I know your probably going to say it was only like 60 extra per person or something but again, that's not what matters, it's the fact that you agreed to go and had to back out last minute. I can tell by your replies that you just want us to say you're nta because you didn't go so you shouldn't have to pay and you can see from most replies, you are. \n\nFor the few who fed anything into the fact that you didn't know the bachelor well, that literally doesn't matter. You knew that when you were invited and you still agreed to go, I think it was just put in to throw yourself a bone but it shouldn't be relevant.", "YTA", "Surely it\u2019d work out only $35-40 each or something the tight fucks", "Definitely not the A.\nYou had good reason not to attend.\nI wouldn't pay and i would definitely ask someone who wasn't there to pay.", "This is exactly why my friends and I don\u2019t book anything until everyone has paid lol you back out  last minute that\u2019s on you,  the cost was factored with the intent of you being there.

If you\u2019re hell bent on your point then go on with it, don\u2019t seek for validation. Like other people have mentioned, there are consequences of losing your good friend. You\u2019ve made your bed, now lie on it.", "Don\u2019t pay, you didn\u2019t go. I think this is a cultural thing. In my country, if one person can\u2019t go, we just divide things among the ones that actually enjoyed the trip. It really depends on the case. For the house? They can just redivide the cost. But if they bought an experience, let\u2019s say a wine tasting, and they can\u2019t get a refund for your ticket, that you should pay.", "ETA but also no one is ? I understand where both of you are coming from. Having to pay for something you didn\u2019t even use or attend doesn\u2019t sound fair at all no matter what kind of notice you give. Getting called into work last minute and having to cancel plans really sucks, most plans don\u2019t cost $337 though\u2026. It\u2019s a shitty position to leave your friend in and I know trying to justify it by giving them free weed would seem reasonable. I don\u2019t know how many people ended up attending but unexpectedly having to pay, let\u2019s say, $50 more for something you already payed for really sucks too. I would ask your friend if you can pay less and have everyone else split whatever remaining cost. If this person really means a lot to you then a compromise can be reached, I don\u2019t think outright refusing to pay would be the solution. Would not paying anything be worth losing a friend ?", "YTA\n\nCommitted to it so they planned for you. Cancelled last minute so the onus is on you.

You had an actual excuse not just some lame one for not attending. You also gave them weed as a sorry gift.

Thank you for proving my point.", "Unpopular but NTA. In any other situation like this I would have said Y T A but it seems that you were invited only to lower the price.

Because the place was already booked independent of you.  You weren't asked to pay in advance.  And you didn't go.  You don't pay for a place you never stayed at.

If this happened to me and one of my friends ( who all have careers, not shitty little jobs that they don\u2019t care about ) and one of my friends had to bail last minute I would be fine with that. It would suck not having my friend there and yeah id have to cough up another $100 or so but I wouldn\u2019t ever imagine trying to make someone pay for an airbnb that they didn\u2019t go to, NTA shit happens and this says a lot about your friends", "NTA. Deduct the cost of the weed, done. People saying is it worth losing a friend... idk I guess they can decide that when it'd cost very little to break up the amount between the attendants.", "ESH.  You should've offered to pay, and they should've graciously declined.  Are y'all all Scots or Dutch or something?", "NTA. The guy who booked the place should have counted on the groomsman and the other close guys to the groom to pay for it. It\u2019s wrong to invite \u2018fringe\u2019 friends and expect them to pay. Who forced your friend to rent such an expensive place anyways?", "I would say soft YTA, but I think if multiple people can't afford to divide the remaining balance of 300 bucks, they shouldn't go on a trip. That amount won't brake the bank if divided.ppl shouldn't try to live beyond their means", "Everyone thought you should pay, huh?  Venmo a request for cash for the weed.  Everybody who gave them the weed thinks you should be paid for it.", "NTA.\n\nAssuming that there were 6 people in the airbnb splitting the bill, that means the remaining 5 people each had to pay an additional $67 because you couldn't go.\n\nMe personally, if I was your friend, I wouldn't put you in that situation just cause I had to pay an additional $67 more than I was planning on. I feel like you're being forced to pay only because most of people there are not your friends, they're your buddy's friend's friends. If I was your friend, I would have told the airbnb guests to be more understanding and to just drop it and enjoy the time that they had even though it was marginally more expensive than they were expecting. It's not like they each had to pay an additional $150. Plus you gave them your home grown weed as a sorry. You didn't have to do that.\n\nI think it's a shitty situation, but I wouldn't make you pay $337 for something you didn't even attend because you couldn't due to circumstances outside your control. Me personally, I'm a much more understanding guy.", "NTA you didn't go you shouldn't have to pay", "Is the value of the weed equal to or more than what you would have paid? If so, I'm going with NTA. If not, then yeah, you should probably at least pay the difference, or offer to make it up some other way.

Everyone saying you\u2019re an ass obviously don\u2019t have jobs that call whenever and expect you to be there.

That's crazy to me. \nI understand you agreed to pay a fair share, TO GO, but you didn't go so you aren't obligated to pay. \n\nAccording to the logic of some of these YTA comments, it's like if you ordered a dish at a restaurant, but discovered (upon arrival) that the dish has an allergen and you cannot eat it. You order something else instead. Should you be obligated to pay for the first dish? (Especially since you didn't touch it at all!)

Planning for when shit happens is apart of any trip.", "YTA\n\nIt sucks but thats how it is. To put it on a smaller scale: if I went out to a restaurant with a friend that had to be reserved with a cancel fee of $150 and I found out I could not go the day before, it is not up to my friend to pay the $150.
