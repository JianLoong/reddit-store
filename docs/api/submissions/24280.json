I get along well enough with the husband and our wives are friends. Their children are older than ours so they don\u2019t really hang out, but everyone gets along. Things have always been pretty smooth until this year. \n\nIn the spring, I noticed there were five arrows sticking in the ground in my back yard. They were standing straight up as though they dropped form a great height.\n\n We only have one set of neighbors so I knew they had to have come from there house. I collected them and went next door and spoke to the husband and he explained their middle school aged daughter had joined the archery team. He explained she must have been practicing and shot them over the fence. \n\nI gave them back and asked if he would talk to her about being more careful. We have two children and a dog who play in the back yard and I didn\u2019t want anyone to be hurt. He agreed and we parted ways. \n\nThis happened three more times with the same general exchange. The fourth time it happened, I lost my temper and told him his kid was being careless and was likely to hurt one of my kids. He replied that she didn\u2019t mean any harm, but I said I didn\u2019t care. If she hit one of my kids, no amount of apologies was going to be sufficient. He said again he would talk to her. \n\nThis morning when I went to let the dog out, there were four damn arrows sticking out of the dirt in my back yard. I pulled them out, broke them, and dropped them on the neighbors porch. \n\nWhen he got home, he came my house and told me I was an asshole for breaking his kids stuff. He was going to call the police and sue me for $160 to replace the damaged equipment. I said that\u2019s fine and shut the door in his face. \n\nHis wife called mine crying and asked if I would just apologize to her husband and buy new arrows. My wife agrees with me, but she\u2019s bias. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1691612867, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15mqig4/aita_for_breaking_my_neighbors_archery_arrows/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No beginner should be using expensive arrows to practice.\n\nEither the parents didn't correct the child, or the child wasn't listening.  This was the FIFTH time.  What I really don't understand is why she made no effort to retrieve them.  Didn't even tell her parents.\n\nMy kids used to do archery.  What happened is, she practiced with five until one went over the fence.  Then she practiced with 4. Then 3.  You have to be dedicated to practice with one arrow, walking back and forth to the target for every shot.", "Nta. I wouldnot have put them on their porch but break them and put in the garbage. Any more arrows since the blowup? I doubt those arrows cost $160.", "Nope", "NTA. She needs to practice at an archery range. Where I live, backyard archery is illegal because people can be killed.\n\nYou have kids and a dog who shouldn't be restricted because your neighbor is irresponsible", "$160 for sticks of wood you found on your property?\n\nNTA in any case, but your neighbor is an idiot.", "Where is this? In Canada, it's a federal crime.\n\nNTA obviously. That girl could literally have killed someone. This is why not just any moron should be allowed to shoot firearms and certainly not a kid without adult supervision.", "They were your arrows. Your neighbors kept gifting them to you, even though you repeatedly said you *really* didn\u2019t want them. \n\nSo you more forcefully demonstrated that *you did not want any more arrows*.  \n\nIf they really cost $160, maybe the archer with shitty aim next door will get a new hobby or at least be delayed in getting more deadly projectiles to shoot into your yard. NTA", "Nta, that\u2019s really dangerous and she needs to learn. Is she with a school or a league? They should be teaching them to never point/shoot the arrows in the direction of where people are.  \n\nKeep breaking those arrows so she learns", "NTA", "NTA. Four chances. Four promises to stop the dangerous behaviour. You were more than generous.\n\nGood luck to the guy telling the police his daughter regularly shoots arrows into someone else\u2019s yard, one in which children and pets can often be found.", ">He was going to call the police\n\nFine, tell him to do that. \n\nI'm sure they will love hearing about arrows shot left and right carelessly in a residential area.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  If she is that damn bad then she shouldn't be practicing near a yard where are kids and pets.  Also $40 per arrow is beyond ridiculous.  Let him call the cops,  I'm sure they'll be interested to know the kid is shooting off arrows in a residential area.", "If she\u2019s getting them in your yard this often, she\u2019s probably not good enough to need $40/piece arrows", "EHS- you shouldn\u2019t have broken the arrows.

So NTA. Those arrows could hurt someone seriously", "NTA - this girl clearly isn\u2019t shooting at a target. She is just shooting up into the sky, with no regard for the result. I would have suggested that you just kept the arrows until they came looking for them and then get the daughter to explain her actions and promise to stop before getting the arrows back.  It\u2019s unfortunate that the dad keeps covering for the kid, even though it could have tragic results. What a jerk.", "NTA Go ahead and call the police yourself.

You should have no problem with the police. \n\nNTA", "NTA.   \n\n\nThe parents had a responsibility to make sure their daughter was practicing safely, and they failed.  Their failure put your family at risk.  They should not be insisting you apologize.  They should be begging you for forgiveness.   \n\n\nAlso, arrows do not cost $40 each.  I'd guess $160 was the total cost of all of her equipment, not just the damaged arrows.   Not that you're obligated to pay for the arrows that you found already damaged in your back yard :P", "NTA you were nice about it several times and they didn't do anything about it.", "NTA.\n\nI'm an archer and qualified archery coach.\n\nRule number 1 of archery: Don't shoot at home if there is a risk that your arrows will end up off your property.\n\nIt's to the extent that the UK archery body specifically sent out an email to all its members during Covid, when clubs were closed, telling them not to shoot at home at all", "NTA \n\nOffer to dial the police for him", "NTA.

Very curious.", "NTA but you should've called the police the second time this happened instead of breaking the arrows.

Either way, not remotely the asshole. Do it again", "NTA I\u2019d consider any arrows after the second request to be a gift from them to me to keep and do what I please with", "She could kill someone.

Just file a police report", "NTA report them to the police, they could kill someone with that careless behavior.", "NTA. Your idiot neighbor is going to tell the cops his family has been shooting arrows into your yard. That will be fun.

Depending on local ordinances, if you are inside some city limits (you say they are your only neighbor)  what his daughter is doing is possibly illegal. A bow is a weapon.

Would they be so forgiving if your kid was constantly chipping golf balls into their backyard?", "NTA, normally I'm not in favor of breaking stuff to prove a point but bow and arrowd are weapons and they shouldn't be being shot in a neighborhood.

That sounds dangerous AF.", "NTA. Arrows are not toys. They can and *do* cause serious injuries and death. If the daughter has taken up archery, they should have a proper padded target placed up against the side of their own building or somewhere that a missed arrow cannot potentially harm anyone. Either he hasn't been talking to his daughter about this, or she's a little brat and is ignoring him and he's doing nothing to discipline her. Regardless of which, those are both his responsibility, not yours.\n\nLet him call the police. Or better yet, call the police yourself and explain what's happening. It sounds like they're guilty of reckless endangerment.", "NTA. She threw stuff over your fence, it's now either trash or yours and you can do with it what you please. Since it's a sharp object and dangerous, by virtue of being a type of ammunition, removing that danger is within your right. If his daughter was shooting a gun and casings somehow got into your yard, imagine what a dingus he would look like if he demanded them back so he could reuse them instead of being concerned that someone is *shooting a gun into the neighbor's yard*. Sure, arrows aren't as dangerous, but they're still a weapon.\n\nLet him call the cops. I'm sure they'll be super interested in why a kid is shooting arrows straight up into the air unsupervised.", "Get in touch with the archery coach at the school and let them know what she's doing.", "NTA honestly I would have just thrown them out the first time lol", "NTA, but why don't you give the cops a call yourself?

It can not be, unless the husband admits some sort of fault on his daughter's behalf.", "NTA.\n\nYou asked nicely and they didn't comply despite saying they would.\n\nNext time I'd keep the arrows and tell him that his daughter obviously didn't want them since they are regularly left in your yard.  Or call the police and let them know of the problem.", "NTA.  Your kids could be seriously injured with those arrows!  $160 will be nothing compared to the medical bills you would have from a wounded kid.

Imagine if you were standing out there and an arrow went into the heart. This is an incredibly outrageous situation", "NTA but don\u2019t give the broken arrows back and put yourself on the hook for damages. Throw them away and let them buy new ones.

I miss it, my shoulder got badly damaged in a car accident a few years ago and I can't shoot anymore", "Yup we got a decent stop net put it infront of the shed and target infront. That way if it moses the net is our she's not next doors fence", "Yeah depending on city ordinances, backyard archery may be illegal.

That's the point here. And no, it is not petty to break the arrows. I'm quite surprised OP kept his cool this long. The arrows were sharp enough to penetrate the ground and strong enough to not break. They were standing straight. OP is not talking about a toy, he's talking about the weapon used in sports. Did you get that?\n\n\nMy dad was into archery. Without a doubt he could have killed someone with this thing, with one hit, easily. So he made sure to find a safe space to practice in our garden, where he could hit nothing and nobody. \n\n\nThe neighbour is obviously the AH for not teaching his kid how to safely handle a weapon.", "A stray arrow could kill someone (or their dog) if it lands the right way \n\nAt minimum a pretty serious injury and a hospital trip since you\u2019re not going to want to pull an arrow(stab wound) out on your own", "Yes, this seems intentional.", "OP asked nicely FOUR TIMES!  \nEdited to add: And then OP asked more firmly AGAIN! Five flippin' chances!", "Or a dead kid", "Again, I\u2019m just questioning on whether the amount of incidents matter. Property damage is still property damage and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the cops said \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you call us?\u201d . I\u2019m not disagreeing with you, I\u2019m just not as optimistic", "I don\u2019t think that would cover purposefully breaking it though. I mean either way the cops are gonna tell them just to quit with the arrows but just because sometbing lands on your property doesn\u2019t exactly mean you can break it"]}
