I get along well enough with the husband and our wives are friends. Their children are older than ours so they don\u2019t really hang out, but everyone gets along. Things have always been pretty smooth until this year. \n\nIn the spring, I noticed there were five arrows sticking in the ground in my back yard. They were standing straight up as though they dropped form a great height.\n\n We only have one set of neighbors so I knew they had to have come from there house. I collected them and went next door and spoke to the husband and he explained their middle school aged daughter had joined the archery team. He explained she must have been practicing and shot them over the fence. \n\nI gave them back and asked if he would talk to her about being more careful. We have two children and a dog who play in the back yard and I didn\u2019t want anyone to be hurt. He agreed and we parted ways. \n\nThis happened three more times with the same general exchange. The fourth time it happened, I lost my temper and told him his kid was being careless and was likely to hurt one of my kids. He replied that she didn\u2019t mean any harm, but I said I didn\u2019t care. If she hit one of my kids, no amount of apologies was going to be sufficient. He said again he would talk to her. \n\nThis morning when I went to let the dog out, there were four damn arrows sticking out of the dirt in my back yard. I pulled them out, broke them, and dropped them on the neighbors porch. \n\nWhen he got home, he came my house and told me I was an asshole for breaking his kids stuff. He was going to call the police and sue me for $160 to replace the damaged equipment. I said that\u2019s fine and shut the door in his face. \n\nHis wife called mine crying and asked if I would just apologize to her husband and buy new arrows. My wife agrees with me, but she\u2019s biased. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdit: The police just left. I called them myself. We live in an annex area where the laws aren\u2019t quite as clear, but the officer believes city ordinance on use on bows, slingshots, or pellet pistols will apply.\n\nEdit 2: For clarity, we have called the police in the past and the incident has been shrugged off.

OP said the arrows were standing straight up meaning they were shot high into the air, not at a target on the ground", "yo do u know what was said abt the comment right under urs thats deleted?", "This is a fantastic comment!! Hopefully OP sees it, I think you're on to something that the game warden may be the one to contact.  I don't know what authority fish and wildlife have, but I know a game warden has a good amount.  Especially with how the arrows were landing, straight up from the ground? Consistently?  That is NOT an accident.  If I were OP, I would've come unglued after the first time finding arrows.\n\nEdit: not sure about authority of fish and wildlife in this situation, I used to work with the agency and I didn't mean to imply they're powerless!  They're great and so beneficial, but in this specific situation I think a game warden may be the better route.", "Happy cake day!", "Agreed. I shot arrows in the backyard with my nieces earlier this year. None landed straight up. We were shooting at a target against a wood pile. Lost one arrow in the wood. But certainly not sticking straight up in the neighbor's yard.", "He might find out next time it rains.  Then the neighbor will be on the hook for a nice sum of money.", "Tell me you're not an archer without telling me you're not an archer.\n\nYes you can get a dozen arrow like objects from amazon for $15, but good arrows can easily go for this. I know people who shoot arrows that are over $100 a piece.", "Hi! Competitive archer here! Good titanium arrows with carbon tips that you get at a shop can easily cost $40-$50 each. They\u2019re lighter and fly further/faster/higher which makes the story of the arrows flying over the fence plausible for a novice who hasn\u2019t quite gotten the hang of aiming and drawing the bowstring at the appropriate length and tension. \n\nIf the daughter is competing, there\u2019s a good chance the instructor requested a certain type of arrow to be purchased. \n\nAs an archer, the neighbor\u2019s daughter can absolutely unalive someone if they\u2019re using good arrows. If the daughter was practicing, she needed to be MUCH closer to the target to master controlling her aim and draw. \n\nNTA", "It sounds evil, but if the arrows are sticking straight up and down like OP implied, it would seem she is doing this on purpose. \n\nAny arrows shot at a target would either just be lying in the grass or in the ground at a somewhat level angle. This girl is shooting them straight into the air, and I can all but guarantee she is doing it on purpose and doesn't realize the consequences. Either that or she is a twisted little kid. They do exist.", "Great news. We went through something similar with the renters behind us. It's terrifying.", "A judge wouldn't be agreeing with you lol", "\"Everyone Sucks Here\"", "This is an excellent point.  If they were truly standing straight up and this isnt exaggerated, then the daughter is being incredibly reckless and should have that bow taken away from her until she proves mature enough to have it.", "[removed]", "Im concerned about this happening with her being on the archery team. when I taught archery at summer camp (7-15 year olds), arrows would go over in the first round of shooting 6, and then they'd learn and end up generally in the direction of the target. Does archery team mean \"here's your bow and arrow, go out into the world and figure it out\"?", "Sometimes they stick diagonally, but most often the angle is pretty low (annoyingly so because that makes them much harder to find)", "Competition arrows, cut to size with field points, cost $8-$15 each. Definitely not $160 for 4, but not as cheap as you found. My kid shoots archery and has for several years. She practices in our yard with a proper backstop.", "How many times do I need to reply that there is an unspoken \"for a 13 year old just learning\" to that sentiment?\n\nYes, I have a longbow.  Yes, when I bought custom arrows in the early 90s it was at like $60 a set.  Yes, I know people who spent way more on even more custom handmade arrows.\n\nYOU ARE NOT GIVING ARROWS THAT COST THAT MUCH TO A 13 YEAR OLD WHO IS JUST STARTING TO LEARN.   At least, not if you're not a moron.\n\nIs that clear enough for you, or do you want to be condescending some more?", "Depends on the arrows. Easton X10 competition arrows are $40.08 for the shaft, plus $3.82 for vanes, nock pin and nock, and if you want the balanced tungsten points, those are $24.58 each. Total cost per arrow: $68.48.\n\nOf course this kid is most likely shooting cheap student arrows, roughly $6-8 each.", "I think it's more prevalent than we realize (but especially with kids) to think that if you aren't knowing aiming something towards someone (and you can't see someone in your path), then it can't possibly hit them.\n\nPeople maybe understand that better about guns, because they see enough tv and movies where guns go off accidentally or are dropped and end up hitting someone.\n\nIt sounds like OP and they are in a somewhat remote area? Not completely remote, but they're the only neighbors?  So the girl is out there, and she's used to the idea that all the land around their house is \"empty\", and if she can't see/hear OP's kids or dog in their yard, that's \"empty\" too.  \n\nSure, in an area without that many people, your odds of hitting someone with a stray arrow are slim... but never zero.  Even if it's one or two kids in a really big yard (so like... 50 square yards, let's say, and your arrow would have to land in 1 out of 50 squares to do damage), too many people think, oh, that's such a low risk, it wouldn't happen!  SMART people know that you *don't chance it*.\n\nNone of this is to excuse the girl, or her father.  They're being idiots.  Just observing that way too many people are bad at assessing risk, so they do things thinking \"oh that'll never happen\".", "Yeah, agreed.  OP \\*could\\* be exaggerating their verticality slightly, but I'm betting not by much.  \n\nIf she had anything like a proper archery set-up in her yard, there ought to be a good-sized back-stop behind the target.  And she shouldn't be THAT bad that she's sending them sailing that far over a properly sized backdrop.", "I have to agree with others who are saying that she might be practicing, but at a certain point, she just starts goofing off.  \n\nAnd even apart from the danger, her father should be having a serious talk with her about goofing off with a weapon like that.  I would HOPE that her coach would be appalled as well (and that they've given the team/class a stern safety talk about what we do, and DO NOT, do with bows and arrows.)\n\nJust sounds like her father is enabling her.  After the FIRST time OP brought the arrows over that had gone into his yard, not only should the father have talked to her, but he should have been there for her next round of practice to see what she's doing, and what she's doing WRONG.  Once it happened a SECOND and THIRD time, he should have instituted a rule that she doesn't practice without adult supervision.", "Or Kagome", "But can she speak with a British accent?", "Or Legolas", "Nah, they want OP to fund the purchase of a new bow and arrows for the daughter so she can ditch the old school equipment.", "Custom arrows are way more expensive than the general one size fits all they tend to sell in superstores and the like. I doubt the school archery team has the time or equipment to dial in compounds for each of their archers", "Depends on if this is western archery / olympic shooting or a more specialized archery such as Turkish Archery or Kyudo. I do Kyudo, and a full dozen arrows costs me roughly $250.", "Yeah, if this father is buying arrows like THAT for his 13 year old daughter who is just starting, then he deserves to eat the cost.", "yes it makes me cringe so much, the teachers and parents are being so irresponsible. I started every archery lesson with \"I am about to give you a weapon. If you joke about hurting someone, point it anywhere but the target, or pick it up before you are told, you will no longer have the privilege of doing archery\". That shit is serious, and bad habits can be deadly", "And I think we all can say a resounding FUCK THAT to that idea!  (And encourage OP to say that.  Honestly. The nerve.)", "The ones in my area expect parents to procure the proper arrows. Having arrows cut to length and the proper weight for the bow speed is a basic part of competitive archery.", "Exactly!  Yeah, I think I first took lessons in my early teens, too.  Every single time I have ever done archery, anywhere, everyone has been dead serious about weapons etiquette.", "Depends on the competitions they enter into, my school exclusively did recurve. While the bows were roughly sized, I wouldn\u2019t say anything about them was custom, arrow and bows were rotated frequently amongst kids of the same size. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the case for this person, I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s possible to buy cheap arrows too."]}
