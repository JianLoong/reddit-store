The only solution is if you ignore it or you go by other methods to make it clear what that means for your relationship. \nIn regards to just the nudity, i would recommend discussing other concerns. i understand if there were other reasons why he might be going nudist such as not liking clothes, but it might go a long way telling about why it\u2019s not okay for guests and practical strangers see your son naked. But also emphasise more severe situations. there are a lot of people who are malevolent souls trying to always do bad things. my personal concern is that the boyfriend might one day invite someone over who wants to take sexual advantage of the son. \nThe nudity itself doesn\u2019t make it any harder to commit such acts in addition some people have a warped sense of reality. so may see his nudity as an invite to start a relationship or a multitude of other things. \nAll in all a negative situation which is why you are definitely not the AH", " NTA however this is a sign you are not compatible when it comes to standards.

Then, I slowly found types that worked well enough for me (right texture/fabric thickness/etc) and now I still get fun, cute socks because it\u2019s a little bit better when at least I like the socks\u2019 appearance a lot. Same goes for finding cute but comfy shoes that I wear said socks with. There\u2019s a good balance to be found between making someone comfortable and preparing them for life. For me it\u2019s been by finding work arounds and keeping home as a comfortable place where I can just relax (not wear socks, not worry as much about faking certain social things, and indulging in some of my hobbies that I personally enjoy but I know aren\u2019t the most socially acceptable, such as miniatures). It is overwhelming to have to constantly put up with sensory issues, especially since some things make me vomit or get migranes, but it\u2019s really helpful to work on finding ways to work around handling different issues. It can be as simple as trying on different clothing types and figuring out ways to get more fruits and veggies into my diet in a way that\u2019s palatable for me.
