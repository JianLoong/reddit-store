The only solution is if you ignore it or you go by other methods to make it clear what that means for your relationship. \nIn regards to just the nudity, i would recommend discussing other concerns. i understand if there were other reasons why he might be going nudist such as not liking clothes, but it might go a long way telling about why it\u2019s not okay for guests and practical strangers see your son naked. But also emphasise more severe situations. there are a lot of people who are malevolent souls trying to always do bad things. my personal concern is that the boyfriend might one day invite someone over who wants to take sexual advantage of the son. \nThe nudity itself doesn\u2019t make it any harder to commit such acts in addition some people have a warped sense of reality. so may see his nudity as an invite to start a relationship or a multitude of other things. \nAll in all a negative situation which is why you are definitely not the AH", " NTA however this is a sign you are not compatible when it comes to standards.
