The reality is I'm still doing the usual weekend routine, (cleaning, tidying, ironing, cooking, bathing the 6yo, mediating between him and our teenager, packing the kids bags, meal planning/ordering the online food for the week ahead, writing lists for what needs collecting or buying from shops while he's home, managing our budget/savings/investments and trying to clear all the clutter from the house that accumulated after my breakdown a few years ago), but now I have the added pressure of washing and drying his weeks worth of clothes before Sunday and the last two weekends he wanted me to finish everything by early evening so we can spend time together as a family.\n\nIf I'm wiped out and having to sleep extra hours at the weekend he'll say I should have a lie-in or a nap,\u00a0 which again sounds supportive, but in practice I've just got everything on that list to do in an even shorter amount of time since he doesn't do any of it while I rest.

I used to do it but now I haven't got anything left in me to take on these projects. He doesn't want a house from an Argos/Dunelm/Ikea catalogue - his preference is out of our price range, so I don't buy anything to replace the broken stuff and we make-do.\n\nAITA for telling my husband he's not as helpful as he makes out he is and is actually creating obstacles instead of making family life run smoother?", "created_utc": 1674868905, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10n28b1/aita_for_telling_my_husband_hes_not_as_helpful_as/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like a big pain in the ass but sometimes putting it down lets you AND the helpful partner see what's actually getting done! Tell him to take the sheet for Saturday, do the crap listed that you did LAST Saturday & then you drive away for the day. Do not answer your phone for 3-4 hours cuz every 3 minutes he'll be calling for help. Then come in & eat the suoper he prepared, flop on the couch til time for kids' bedtime. Then go to bed.\n\nNTA\n\neta words", "NTA, but I think the wording could be clarified in that I think you need to explain to him why.\n\nYou\u2019re essentially living as a single mom, and he comes home for the weekend, ie. the \u201cfun\u201d time.\n\nHow was he before this course? Is the course going for much longer? \n\nIt honestly made me quite sad that when he did come home he was complaining about clutter and things being broken. If it\u2019s an issue for him, he needs to fix it, or shut up.\nIt\u2019s petty of me to say, but I would leave his laundry for him to do (or, he can get it dry cleaned while he\u2019s away). He\u2019s an adult, he can prepare his things for his activities, that\u2019s his responsibility, not yours.\n\nI\u2019m really sorry to hear about your conditions too. They have a huge impact on fatigue and well, just functioning! I imagine this situation isn\u2019t helping? Are you able to consider therapy? I feel they may be helpful for navigating how to communicate these issues with your husband.", "NTA What your husband has done is a very common and frustrating thing. He has demanded that you manage him. He says he'll help you if you ask him, but that's a convenient way for him to turn his brain off and dump the entire burden of managing everyone in the house on you. It also allows him to blame you if things don't get done, because he'll say that you should have told him.", "It sounds to me like you are putting too much pressure on yourself.  You are his wife, not his mother.   Stop doing his laundry!  Also, it's a lot easier to make a list than it is to remember to do everything,  and then do it.  He had told you he doesn't expect you to do all that stuff, and has asked you to make a list.  Do that!  And put doing his own laundry at the top of that list.", "NTA but at the end of the day you're likely going to have to find the time and energy to dig deep and have a long conversation with him. At least if you want anything to change for the positive. Is a house keeper an option? And are you in therapy?", "NTA. Time to come up with a new plan. You're essentially living as a single parent most of the time, it's time he stopped reaping the benefits of this. \n\nDon't do his chores. He can wash and iron his own clothes. Start writing up a timetable for your weekends, a realistic schedule of what you need to do and the time you need to do it. Family time is important, but it still needs to fit the schedule. If there's no time in the schedule for family time then *he* needs to make it. That doesn't mean putting something off, or deciding that something isn't as important as family time, it means that *he* has to complete a task while you are doing something else to free up that gap. If he disagrees with this, explain that you're sick of him coming home with a list of complaints, doing nothing to help with those problems, then interrupting the time you need to solve them.", "NTA: He can start helping by doing his own freaking laundry!!! I had my husband start doing his own because I was already doing mine and the kids and everything else a SAHM does, it's the bare minimum to do you own laundry!", "ARen't the kids in school full time?  Can't you move some of this stuff you do (like ordering food and meal planning, kids laundry, budgeting ) to when they are in school?", "I\u2019m going with NTA because it is indeed a lot of extra work in a little time. However, I\u2019d like to point out that the way you might have said it if you were stressed could\u2019ve made you look like TA. You can say something that is correct, but if it\u2019s the wrong way then it\u2019s done (not saying that you\u2019ve done it, but you seem overloaded and it can be stressing which leads us to say things straight-forward. I do it too).\nTalking about overloaded, you\u2019ve mentioned in the beginning of your post that you have some mental health issues. Can you get some help, maybe therapy? It really helped be more functional with my depression - better yet, life was more enjoyable.

My wife and I both put in the work (she has a part time job and me a full time job with four kids).  You both have to work but also make time for each other.  we have two times a week that are ideal for us; we utilize that time for sex or just to talk and catch up while we are both doing chores.  For me as a husband, i love knowing i have set time with her.  We both try and watch out for each others needs and really try and make life easier.  I use a handy man app when i cant get to stuff and try to be realistic about time, energy and money constraints\u2026", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

One of my least favorite traits is when people act like you\u2019re being unreasonable because they\u2019re \u201chappy to help\u2014just tell them what to do!\u201d That\u2019s exhausting. You\u2019re not his mom. You don\u2019t need to assign him chores. He needs to be an adult.", "This. He lives there too. If he sees clutter, he can fix it. He needs to do more when home than just the dishes and putting the kid to bed - that's what, 2-3 hours of work? NTA But OP should clearly communicate what she wants him to do instead.", "She's still working 24/7 then. Does she never get a break? I agree some of that could be done during the day but frankly she deserves a few hours to herself, add that on her laundry, bedding, cooking herself meals, showering, grocery shopping, cleaning from the morning, whatever daily house tasks she has beyond that. Then shes expected to meal plan for her kids, herself and her husband, then budget thelat out for the month, pay the bills, do the kids laundry. By the time that's done the kids are back. Then you have home work and dinner and bath time and hopefully some quality time with the kids. Then you go to sleep, wake up and do it all over again. There's a reason why working moms are beyond stressed and it's bc even SAHM's can't even keep up let alone working moms. Especially if your partner isn't willing nor is able to. SAHM's on average work 98 hours a week. That's IF they have a supportive partner too. Imagine not having a supportive partner. I could almost garentee that if the kids need an appointment or are sick or get a call from school She's the only one taking that responsibility on. It's not as simple as do it all while they are gone. She's exghusted. She deserves a break and a vacation just like anyone else who works.", "Yes but she's also a sahm and agoraphobic.  She needs help around the house and also a therapist to help her. She is overwhelmed and deserves a sleep in. But if her husband is trying to get her to leave the house he needs to pitch in for house work and also help her get therapy. Agoraphobia is no joke."]}
