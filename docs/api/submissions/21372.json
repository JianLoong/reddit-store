Listen to your gut.", "ESH. Agree that adding him to the title is not a solution. However, you should have thought of having a legal agreement regarding his contribution to closing costs the minute you both chose to go along with this arrangement. You could have done this without adding him to the title. How exactly do you think that would have gone down if you both decided to break up? Would he have really just not acknowledged his $22k contribution? Where it came from (severance pay) doesn\u2019t matter. He chose to cover your closing costs. What would that have been exactly\u2026 a gift to you? \n\nYTA for not acknowledging his contribution to the closing costs in another way. Would you have been able to close on your own without that $22k? Sounds like he wants to be on the title in order to have that amount of money acknowledged in the event of things falling apart between the two of you. A legal agreement accounting for the closing cost contribution and a solution to address it in the event of you two breaking up or whatever would have been a way to mitigate you having to add him to the title. Frankly, I don\u2019t think you should have even accepted his offer to cover closing costs but you did. \n\nBoyfriend is TA for trying to get his name on the title as the only solution for this. It\u2019s not and he should understand why you are hesitant to add him there. He should not have offered to cover closing costs without discussing how to recoup the costs in the event of you two splitting up while he\u2019s not on the title and mortgage.\n\nBoth of you did not think this through.", "YTA a bit - here\u2019s the thing, if he\u2019s paying $22,000 in closing costs, he\u2019s entitled to some equity. Presumably he\u2019s also going to be contributing the monthly mortgage, and is entitled to have that ownership stake. I don\u2019t know the difference between your down payment and his closing contributions, but he does deserve some level of equitable title on par with the level of his stake. If you\u2019re in an escrow state, talk to your escrow officers about your options for holding tenancy. If you\u2019re in a lawyer state ask them. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a case where you\u2019re actually purchasing all by yourself, and then he\u2019s moving in and demanding to be on title \u201cbecause he pays rent\u201d. This is a case where he is assisting in the initial purchase and (again presumably) also contributing to the mortgage and should justly have some level of security that if the relationship ends, he isn\u2019t just out the at least $22k. I\u2019m not saying you should hold joint tenancy aka 50/50 on the deed unless there\u2019s been 50/50 outlay, but there are ways to draft ownership that indicates percentages of ownership he he rightly deserves some of that security.\n\nAlso the fact is you got the loan you did because of the preferential rates, while still using his contribution, and expecting his continued contribution.", "NTA. If he wants the benefits of the title then he also needs the responsibility of the mortgage.", "INFO is he moving states to move in with you? And did that contribute to why he\u2019s unemployed?\n\nIf so, I can see this from his perspective. He\u2019s contributing his entire nest egg to this house and also moving to where you have a job. It\u2019s not unreasonable to expect you to offer him some security in return. You know him better than us: is he the kind of guy who\u2019ll stay unemployed? Or is this just transitional and he\u2019ll find work again soon? $22k severance implies that he\u2019s a high income earner.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I suspect OP could not cover closing costs on her own.", "Very true. I thought maybe I should\u2019ve mentioned that part. I came up with a BUNCH of options regarding how to deal with the assistance with closing costs: 1) promissory note for repayment to him, 2) lease agreement with 1/2 mortgage as rent and a rent to co-own clause with any closing costs or rent payments going in toward his future equity, 3) $300,000 promissory note where defaulting on his half of the mortgage meant he ceded ownership to me, 4) an agreement to refinance and put his name on title as soon as it was feasible or repayment of closing cost assistance, 5) agreement to refinance and put him on title if/when we get married. \n\n\u2026.

So why exactly didn\u2019t you consult an real estate attorney over these options and just take his closing cost assistance? Dude is literally giving you a $22k gift right now. For $22k, it\u2019s worth any fee you might have to give one to help with drafting the agreement whether it\u2019s via prom note, or a lien on the property, etc. (Property lien is a popular way around me for people in your boyfriend\u2019s position to protect an investment.)\n\nThe only way for you to have an \u201cironclad agreement\u201d is through the use of a lawyer to navigate the agreement, for discussions to be had outside verbal agreements between the two of you, and signatures added to paper. That\u2019s it.", "I can appreciate that, have you talked to your escrow officer, or title officer, or lawyer conducting the sale (whatever your state uses) about your options in holding ownership (aka tenancy?) There are ways to put him on title to protect his financial interest in this sale, without also immediately granting him 50% ownership. You\u2019ll likely also want to talk to your lender and see if they will even allow you to close with someone on title that is not also on the loan. And depending on those answers, you may want to figure a way to close the sale without his contribution.", "If the contribution is comparable to rent, no need to give him equity. Your credit is making this investment. You have the risk. You're entitled to any capital appreciation. He's just paying to live in your investment.\n\nAlso, what happens after 9 months? Does he continue to contribute, or is that dependent on whether he gets a job and for how much pay? If this is a temporary thing, and he plans to contribute equally to the mortgage payment, maybe it's reasonable.\n\nBut it's just honestly a better idea for unmarried people not to own houses together. If things don't work out, it's a big entanglement. If you're sure things will work out, then go ahead and get married.", "I think he should still be entitled to a fraction of the equity. I\u2019m a real estate professional, but I am not her real estate professional- and without knowing location -may or may not be licensed to practice real estate where the purchase is happening. That out of the way, so many people (especially here on Reddit) seem to think that putting someone on title Always means they get half. That\u2019s not true. You can own a percentage of real property - the percentage to me should be based on his contribution to close against her down payment and initial fees. He has some skin in the game, and unfortunately a let\u2019s scrupulous person could in theory decide the day after closing \u201c thanks for the gift, this isn\u2019t working out, best of luck to you\u201d. I also interpreted that the way he got his funds, was through leaving his gainful employment, so that he could move with her. That\u2019s not inconsiderable.\n\nDepending on the state, or rather at least in my state,\nFunds contributed to a sale of real property that come from anyone other than the buyer typically require what\u2019s called a gift letter. Usually that indicates that it  is not a loan or has no expectation of repayment - because if it does qualify as a personal loan, that could change whether or not the buyer qualifies due to outstanding debt.\n\nJust my opinion on", "That's definitely the best option.  Had a client who refused to agree about getting a prenup ($3,000) on a $500k+ home or the both of them and put her (no money down btw) on the title with him.  Mind you I asked him about much the attorney in the divorce cost him and he admitted it was $30k+.  Still refused the prenup.", "Thank you!", "You should cover the closing, then", "You should just cover the closing cost, then and resolve this. If it\u2019s \u201conly a few months\u201d it\u2019s not clear to me why you wouldn\u2019t do this given the alternative with taking his money. Then cross the bridge to re-financing and add him to the mortgage and title whenever that comes. $22k isn\u2019t a small amount for most people and quite honestly, his contribution did support and help your ability to qualify for the mortgage and rate you received.", "In hindsight, we absolutely should\u2019ve. Between finishing residency and going through this process it has felt like a mad scramble and there\u2019s definitely been a lot of learning. Probably should\u2019ve waited a few months to buy until we had time to fully consider everything. You\u2019re absolutely right.", "We have talked to mortgage broker but not to an attorney. Will try to do the latter option for closing and figure it all out afterwards.", "That\u2019s why I said he should have an agreement to get his money back if they split up. Even if closing is in two weeks that\u2019s a pretty standard agreement to draw up with attorney.", "Heard and appreciate the advice. I think you\u2019re right.", "That, or even waited to buy after your relationship is truly solid (aka marriage). Buying while in such a bf/gf relationship just feels odd to me. Two years of dating is nothing. Yeah, you know each other pretty well and all but there's still a lot to uncover. You're seeing a bit of that right now with how he's handling (er reacting to) this whole situation.", "No, yeah, I\u2019m presuming that the purchase is in the states but I could be wrong. If it is- Depending on the state, each side may or may not have a real estate agent/brokerage representing them, and then once the sale or purchase agreement is accepted there is usually some form of neutral third-party that ensures all the paperwork is in order and that all the laws are followed. In my state escrow and title are usually the same company, while in Southern California (for example) They\u2019re usually separate. on parts of the East Coast, those actions are typically handled by attorneys. So whomever that person or company is for this sale, you may want to consider reaching out or have your agent reach out with those questions. It may also be worth speaking to your lender to find out if underwriting will even fund on a sale where there are parties of interest on title that aren\u2019t also financially responsible for the property.", "Very true."]}
