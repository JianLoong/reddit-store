Would you have been able to close on your own without that $22k? Sounds like he wants to be on the title in order to have that amount of money acknowledged in the event of things falling apart between the two of you. A legal agreement accounting for the closing cost contribution and a solution to address it in the event of you two breaking up or whatever would have been a way to mitigate you having to add him to the title.

So why exactly didn\u2019t you consult an real estate attorney over these options and just take his closing cost assistance? Dude is literally giving you a $22k gift right now.

There are ways to put him on title to protect his financial interest in this sale, without also immediately granting him 50% ownership.

And depending on those answers, you may want to figure a way to close the sale without his contribution.", "If the contribution is comparable to rent, no need to give him equity. Your credit is making this investment. You have the risk. You're entitled to any capital appreciation. He's just paying to live in your investment.\n\nAlso, what happens after 9 months? Does he continue to contribute, or is that dependent on whether he gets a job and for how much pay? If this is a temporary thing, and he plans to contribute equally to the mortgage payment, maybe it's reasonable.\n\nBut it's just honestly a better idea for unmarried people not to own houses together. If things don't work out, it's a big entanglement. If you're sure things will work out, then go ahead and get married.", "I think he should still be entitled to a fraction of the equity. I\u2019m a real estate professional, but I am not her real estate professional- and without knowing location -may or may not be licensed to practice real estate where the purchase is happening. That out of the way, so many people (especially here on Reddit) seem to think that putting someone on title Always means they get half. That\u2019s not true. You can own a percentage of real property - the percentage to me should be based on his contribution to close against her down payment and initial fees. He has some skin in the game, and unfortunately a let\u2019s scrupulous person could in theory decide the day after closing \u201c thanks for the gift, this isn\u2019t working out, best of luck to you\u201d. I also interpreted that the way he got his funds, was through leaving his gainful employment, so that he could move with her. That\u2019s not inconsiderable.\n\nDepending on the state, or rather at least in my state,\nFunds contributed to a sale of real property that come from anyone other than the buyer typically require what\u2019s called a gift letter. Usually that indicates that it  is not a loan or has no expectation of repayment - because if it does qualify as a personal loan, that could change whether or not the buyer qualifies due to outstanding debt.\n\nJust my opinion on", "That's definitely the best option.  Had a client who refused to agree about getting a prenup ($3,000) on a $500k+ home or the both of them and put her (no money down btw) on the title with him.  Mind you I asked him about much the attorney in the divorce cost him and he admitted it was $30k+.  Still refused the prenup.", "Thank you!", "You should cover the closing, then", "You should just cover the closing cost, then and resolve this. If it\u2019s \u201conly a few months\u201d it\u2019s not clear to me why you wouldn\u2019t do this given the alternative with taking his money. Then cross the bridge to re-financing and add him to the mortgage and title whenever that comes. $22k isn\u2019t a small amount for most people and quite honestly, his contribution did support and help your ability to qualify for the mortgage and rate you received.", "In hindsight, we absolutely should\u2019ve. Between finishing residency and going through this process it has felt like a mad scramble and there\u2019s definitely been a lot of learning. Probably should\u2019ve waited a few months to buy until we had time to fully consider everything. You\u2019re absolutely right.", "We have talked to mortgage broker but not to an attorney. Will try to do the latter option for closing and figure it all out afterwards.", "That\u2019s why I said he should have an agreement to get his money back if they split up. Even if closing is in two weeks that\u2019s a pretty standard agreement to draw up with attorney.", "Heard and appreciate the advice. I think you\u2019re right.", "That, or even waited to buy after your relationship is truly solid (aka marriage). Buying while in such a bf/gf relationship just feels odd to me. Two years of dating is nothing. Yeah, you know each other pretty well and all but there's still a lot to uncover. You're seeing a bit of that right now with how he's handling (er reacting to) this whole situation.", "No, yeah, I\u2019m presuming that the purchase is in the states but I could be wrong. If it is- Depending on the state, each side may or may not have a real estate agent/brokerage representing them, and then once the sale or purchase agreement is accepted there is usually some form of neutral third-party that ensures all the paperwork is in order and that all the laws are followed. In my state escrow and title are usually the same company, while in Southern California (for example) They\u2019re usually separate. on parts of the East Coast, those actions are typically handled by attorneys. So whomever that person or company is for this sale, you may want to consider reaching out or have your agent reach out with those questions. It may also be worth speaking to your lender to find out if underwriting will even fund on a sale where there are parties of interest on title that aren\u2019t also financially responsible for the property.", "Very true.", "So I am the boyfriend. My girlfriend showed me this post and I freaked out a bit because I feel that it is a violation of confidence to post our personal lives on the internet because the internet is forever and nothing is truly anonymous.\n\nI also feel like she has left out some very key context that may shed some light on this, I will start by going through her story and then I will add the context that I feel is missing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I\u2019m a physician (33f) and recently graduated residency.

My GF has worked her ass off to get to where she is and I have constantly told her how proud of her I am for it, I genuinely believe she is going to change the world and I have told her as much. I love her deeply.\n\nAs far as living on next to nothing and barely scraping by, I can't speak to the time before we were together but I can tell you that for the 2 years we have been together she has not paid for a single meal or drink while in my presence, she does not pay for groceries, she does not pay for our dogs veterinary bills, she currently does not know which veterinarian our dogs go to, when her trucks AC broke down in the first 6 months of our relationship I paid for the entire repair no questions asked, when her truck needed a new battery I paid for it. When I lost my job I still paid for everything up until the last 6 weeks because i was waiting on my severance, I have of course offered to pay for anything she covered during that time.\n\nI have always loved to do these things for her because I was making more money than her at the time and I understood money was tight. I never once asked for repayment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Now I have a job and am buying a house in a different state.\n\nWhat she also does not mention is that we are both living in a state foreign to us because she is completing her residency here.

He is using his severance pay from his last job to help with closing costs ($22,000), but the mortgage ($554,000) is a doctors loan and is only under my name bc we got better interest rates that way.\n\nAgain, partially true/missing context. My GF and I had previously agreed we wanted to buy a house together but the timing of my job loss was not good and I asked her to wait just 2-3 months until I found another job in our new state. That way we would both be on the mortgage and we would both be able to enter into the purchase on even footing and there wouldn't be an unbalanaced power dynamic. On a whim of hers we drove to the new city one weekend to look at houses, within 48 hours of leaving the city she unilaterally decided to put in an offer.\n\nI begged her to wait and told her that buying your first home (or any home for that matter) in a rush is a bad idea, she looked me dead in the eye and told me she was \"buying a house with or without me\". I should have told her to go for it without me and called her bluff but I selfishly didn't want to lose her and I was already in a weakened position not having a job so instead of standing my ground, I caved. My mistake.\n\nBy the way, this 1,000 mile trip to see houses was done in my car and I paid for gas. To be fair, she did pay for our $89 a night hotel room.\n\nAs a result of this rushed process she purchased a home that is more expensive than I would have agreed to and she doesn't even know how much her student loan payments are going to be each month once forgiveness ends. Her entire family and mine agree that she made a rash decision, earlier today she herself conceded that she \"may have rushed into things a little quickly\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He feels it is important that we are both on the title.

We were planning to get married someday but I\u2019m honestly not sure after the arguments we\u2019ve had over this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I previosuly said, I practically begged her to rent for 2-3 months. That would have accomplished several things in my mind. It would have prevented her from rushing into a very big and expensive decision and it would have allowed us both to be responsible for the mortgage and hold title to the property. She rejected that.\n\nIt was only once she saw how saddened I was by the fact that I was going to miss out on a huge life event (purchasing your first home with your partner) that she offered to put me on title.

If you think something like counseling might fix the relationship, by all means.  But if not, rethink the situation.\n\nThere is a LOT more to this situation than you've addressed, but the simple fact is that you either believe that this relationship is a \"long haul\" one, or it's not.  If it is, work hard to establish the foundation and understanding of respective roles and responsibilities (and put that stuff in writing.)

There are just a few  limitations here:\n\n1. The homeowner cannot have relied on the partner in any capacity, to purchase the house.\n2. The homeowner cannot be relying on the other partner\u2019s rent to afford their mortgage\n3. Rent cannot equal more than 1/2 the monthly interest payment on the mortgage (and will therefore decrease monthly) + 1/2 of monthly utility bills.\n4. No home improvement items or house specific furnishings/fixtures should be purchased by the non-owning partner. They are a renter. These are not their responsibility \n5. The non-owning partner has renter\u2019s insurance and a lease document protecting them \n6.

Which, by the way - she already accepted another $5k towards the house. So let\u2019s make that $27k", "This is correct. He\u2019s using his severance pay for the $22,000.", "it should be more than the 22k though. Imagine that after 4 years they split. He would only get 22k back, while the property has increased in value. He is basically giving an interest-free loan in this scenario, not really fair.", "I don't disagree they should probably marry.  Idk she just seems kind of like a shit.  My current wife and I were able to come to an agreement and purchase a house before we were married that was equitable and beneficial for both of us.\n\nOP just kind of rail roaded her boyfriend by her multiple actions and left him out of the decision making process.  He even asked her to hold off on buying a house until he has a new job and could pay, but OP went ahead with her own plans, even though she received so much help from her boyfriend over the years.  And the BF still wanting to be a part of the plans even though OP is railroading him, offered all the closing which OP can't afford on her own, and if she can't afford closing shes not getting the house anyways and OP won't even put him on the title.", "Are you the BF? Otherwise seems you\u2019re assuming a lot. \u201cYears\u201d would mean they moved in together as soon as they started dating and he started paying for everything. Seems like now she\u2019ll be doing the same for him for a while, it\u2019s only fair. OP isn\u2019t offering him nothing, she just doesn\u2019t want him in the title when he\u2019s not liable in the mortgage which makes sense when their relationship is not really that long. She needs to figure out ways to repay the 22K if she really is taking them. OP\u2019s parents\u2019 opinions about whether she should buy a house are irrelevant for this judgement.", "Uh-huh\u2026.. yeahhhh, that makes me doubt this is at all real, because that\u2019s just perfect Reddit rage-bait.", "I'm confused how OP was barely making ends meet and then has enough for a deposit suddenly? Unless there was a year or so between then and now at least, she was just saving all her money while he provided.", "It honestly sounds like she wants all the benefits with no risk. Bf is getting the short end of the stick if he puts up $22k for no title. That\u2019s opportunity cost, and an IOU?

What about the months prior to the 2 months you paid? Was rent split? If I was contributing 22k and you weren't but you had the loan, having both names should be on the title. Depending on where you live that 22k could last nearly 2 yrs of rent (when split with someone, aka 2k per month). Will he take that long to get a job and start contributing?", "It\u2019s fine to buy if youre unmarried but make it your own investment that you can cover independently", "Not for a small fraction of a 500k house. She's holding all the debt.\n\nI agree she shouldn't take his money, but I also want to point out y'all acting like she can just buy whenever. Not buying means signing another lease, and that 5k can easily be first, last, and security deposit. We also do not know if the 5k is towards the 22k or not because the only way OP can delete comments would be if they were physically together and she had access to his reddit account. The simpler answer is he's the one actually deleting them, likely because putting 22k towards a house when you don't have a job is stupid and there's more to this story\n\nOP's solution is reasonable- buy now, don't delay a full year losing money on rent, and refinance when bf has a job to put him on the mortgage. He needs to be willing to hold the debt if he wants a stake in the house\n\nAnd I don't have the capacity to comment on the difference between closing costs and mortgage per your \"fraud\" comment.  The fraud part would come from him not being on the mortgage.... not the title", "Yep.  That's why his $22k is incredibly valuable right now, and why he deserves a portion of the equity.", "There was a post in the real estate sub not long ago just like this. A man contributed a large sum towards his girlfriend\u2019s down payment and paid half the mortgage for 12 years. His name was never put on the house.

And the crazy thing is legally she didn\u2019t have to even give that back since it was considered a gift. \n\nI think if you contribute towards the sale at the beginning you should get a percentage of equity in the house.", "I think your run that risk with little protection if you act financially like you're married but don't have the legal protections of marriage in the event of a break up.\n\nIs it kind of sucky that people do stuff like get a medical degree and dump their supportive partner for a better one (even after they may contribute 5-25k on a new house)?

That 22k less extrapolated with interest rates, plus the fact that the 22k probably resulted in a 0.2% lower interest (give or take) means that the mortgage payment is roughly a little under 400$ cheaper per month and over the course of the 30 year mortgage probably makes the mortgage about 120,000$ cheaper. PLUS the house is going to go up in value over that time, meaning his 22,000 dollar investment into the house will in total be truly worth closer to 150k in the long run. If she can protect herself by not putting him on the title, why shouldn't his investment into property also be protected by giving him proportional equity?

Hence why people are saying he should at least get that equity guaranteedback if she won't put him on the title.
