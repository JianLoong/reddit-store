Would you have been able to close on your own without that $22k? Sounds like he wants to be on the title in order to have that amount of money acknowledged in the event of things falling apart between the two of you. A legal agreement accounting for the closing cost contribution and a solution to address it in the event of you two breaking up or whatever would have been a way to mitigate you having to add him to the title. Frankly, I don\u2019t think you should have even accepted his offer to cover closing costs but you did. \n\nBoyfriend is TA for trying to get his name on the title as the only solution for this. It\u2019s not and he should understand why you are hesitant to add him there.

I don\u2019t know the difference between your down payment and his closing contributions, but he does deserve some level of equitable title on par with the level of his stake.

You\u2019ll likely also want to talk to your lender and see if they will even allow you to close with someone on title that is not also on the loan. And depending on those answers, you may want to figure a way to close the sale without his contribution.", "If the contribution is comparable to rent, no need to give him equity. Your credit is making this investment. You have the risk. You're entitled to any capital appreciation. He's just paying to live in your investment.\n\nAlso, what happens after 9 months? Does he continue to contribute, or is that dependent on whether he gets a job and for how much pay? If this is a temporary thing, and he plans to contribute equally to the mortgage payment, maybe it's reasonable.\n\nBut it's just honestly a better idea for unmarried people not to own houses together. If things don't work out, it's a big entanglement. If you're sure things will work out, then go ahead and get married.", "I think he should still be entitled to a fraction of the equity. I\u2019m a real estate professional, but I am not her real estate professional- and without knowing location -may or may not be licensed to practice real estate where the purchase is happening. That out of the way, so many people (especially here on Reddit) seem to think that putting someone on title Always means they get half. That\u2019s not true. You can own a percentage of real property - the percentage to me should be based on his contribution to close against her down payment and initial fees. He has some skin in the game, and unfortunately a let\u2019s scrupulous person could in theory decide the day after closing \u201c thanks for the gift, this isn\u2019t working out, best of luck to you\u201d. I also interpreted that the way he got his funds, was through leaving his gainful employment, so that he could move with her. That\u2019s not inconsiderable.\n\nDepending on the state, or rather at least in my state,\nFunds contributed to a sale of real property that come from anyone other than the buyer typically require what\u2019s called a gift letter. Usually that indicates that it  is not a loan or has no expectation of repayment - because if it does qualify as a personal loan, that could change whether or not the buyer qualifies due to outstanding debt.\n\nJust my opinion on", "That's definitely the best option.  Had a client who refused to agree about getting a prenup ($3,000) on a $500k+ home or the both of them and put her (no money down btw) on the title with him.  Mind you I asked him about much the attorney in the divorce cost him and he admitted it was $30k+.  Still refused the prenup.", "Thank you!", "You should cover the closing, then", "You should just cover the closing cost, then and resolve this. If it\u2019s \u201conly a few months\u201d it\u2019s not clear to me why you wouldn\u2019t do this given the alternative with taking his money. Then cross the bridge to re-financing and add him to the mortgage and title whenever that comes. $22k isn\u2019t a small amount for most people and quite honestly, his contribution did support and help your ability to qualify for the mortgage and rate you received.", "In hindsight, we absolutely should\u2019ve. Between finishing residency and going through this process it has felt like a mad scramble and there\u2019s definitely been a lot of learning. Probably should\u2019ve waited a few months to buy until we had time to fully consider everything. You\u2019re absolutely right.", "We have talked to mortgage broker but not to an attorney. Will try to do the latter option for closing and figure it all out afterwards.", "That\u2019s why I said he should have an agreement to get his money back if they split up. Even if closing is in two weeks that\u2019s a pretty standard agreement to draw up with attorney.", "Heard and appreciate the advice. I think you\u2019re right.", "That, or even waited to buy after your relationship is truly solid (aka marriage). Buying while in such a bf/gf relationship just feels odd to me. Two years of dating is nothing. Yeah, you know each other pretty well and all but there's still a lot to uncover. You're seeing a bit of that right now with how he's handling (er reacting to) this whole situation.", "No, yeah, I\u2019m presuming that the purchase is in the states but I could be wrong. If it is- Depending on the state, each side may or may not have a real estate agent/brokerage representing them, and then once the sale or purchase agreement is accepted there is usually some form of neutral third-party that ensures all the paperwork is in order and that all the laws are followed. In my state escrow and title are usually the same company, while in Southern California (for example) They\u2019re usually separate. on parts of the East Coast, those actions are typically handled by attorneys. So whomever that person or company is for this sale, you may want to consider reaching out or have your agent reach out with those questions. It may also be worth speaking to your lender to find out if underwriting will even fund on a sale where there are parties of interest on title that aren\u2019t also financially responsible for the property.", "Very true.", "So I am the boyfriend. My girlfriend showed me this post and I freaked out a bit because I feel that it is a violation of confidence to post our personal lives on the internet because the internet is forever and nothing is truly anonymous.\n\nI also feel like she has left out some very key context that may shed some light on this, I will start by going through her story and then I will add the context that I feel is missing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I\u2019m a physician (33f) and recently graduated residency.

My GF has worked her ass off to get to where she is and I have constantly told her how proud of her I am for it, I genuinely believe she is going to change the world and I have told her as much. I love her deeply.\n\nAs far as living on next to nothing and barely scraping by, I can't speak to the time before we were together but I can tell you that for the 2 years we have been together she has not paid for a single meal or drink while in my presence, she does not pay for groceries, she does not pay for our dogs veterinary bills, she currently does not know which veterinarian our dogs go to, when her trucks AC broke down in the first 6 months of our relationship I paid for the entire repair no questions asked, when her truck needed a new battery I paid for it. When I lost my job I still paid for everything up until the last 6 weeks because i was waiting on my severance, I have of course offered to pay for anything she covered during that time.\n\nI have always loved to do these things for her because I was making more money than her at the time and I understood money was tight. I never once asked for repayment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Now I have a job and am buying a house in a different state.\n\nWhat she also does not mention is that we are both living in a state foreign to us because she is completing her residency here.

He is using his severance pay from his last job to help with closing costs ($22,000), but the mortgage ($554,000) is a doctors loan and is only under my name bc we got better interest rates that way.\n\nAgain, partially true/missing context. My GF and I had previously agreed we wanted to buy a house together but the timing of my job loss was not good and I asked her to wait just 2-3 months until I found another job in our new state. That way we would both be on the mortgage and we would both be able to enter into the purchase on even footing and there wouldn't be an unbalanaced power dynamic. On a whim of hers we drove to the new city one weekend to look at houses, within 48 hours of leaving the city she unilaterally decided to put in an offer.\n\nI begged her to wait and told her that buying your first home (or any home for that matter) in a rush is a bad idea, she looked me dead in the eye and told me she was \"buying a house with or without me\". I should have told her to go for it without me and called her bluff but I selfishly didn't want to lose her and I was already in a weakened position not having a job so instead of standing my ground, I caved. My mistake.\n\nBy the way, this 1,000 mile trip to see houses was done in my car and I paid for gas. To be fair, she did pay for our $89 a night hotel room.\n\nAs a result of this rushed process she purchased a home that is more expensive than I would have agreed to and she doesn't even know how much her student loan payments are going to be each month once forgiveness ends. Her entire family and mine agree that she made a rash decision, earlier today she herself conceded that she \"may have rushed into things a little quickly\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He feels it is important that we are both on the title.

That would have accomplished several things in my mind. It would have prevented her from rushing into a very big and expensive decision and it would have allowed us both to be responsible for the mortgage and hold title to the property. She rejected that.\n\nIt was only once she saw how saddened I was by the fact that I was going to miss out on a huge life event (purchasing your first home with your partner) that she offered to put me on title.

And it wouldn't be an eviction with a limited number of days.\n\nSo if you don't trust her, why would you even buy a property with her?\n\nI'm against buying properties without marriage because it's impossible to force a sale and people can get vindictive.

You may well be giving half the house to him, depending on local law.  You need an attorney to advise you.  This is actually a simple query and you get get it answered by no later than 3 pm tomorrow if you call some family law attorneys first thing in the morning.  Your question is, what happens if we break up after buying this house."]}
