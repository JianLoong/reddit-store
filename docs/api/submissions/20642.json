She claims she will pay us back this Friday but she has never paid back a full payment. One time we loaned her $100 and she only gave back $60 in turn making us short on our own bill. My bf is furious that I would want his mom to be without lights and that I don\u2019t care. I would like to further explain why I don\u2019t particularly care about her lights being out. Firstly she spends money on unimportant things like weed and cigarettes and sells her food stamps during the month so there\u2019s that. Secondly when me and my bf split up about 2 years ago she was our babysitter while we both worked. (mainly mine bc our child lived full time with me) She would constantly say she couldn\u2019t watch him making me quit about 4 jobs bc she couldn\u2019t handle him (he was such a good baby though). So my uncaring comes from a place of resentment. She didn\u2019t care that I had a child and bills so why should I care about her lights being out for maybe 2 dats.

You didn\u2019t have a child, you had her grandchild. And it\u2019s your money. You do have to give it to anyone. Your bf is clearly an enabler.

He literally drove across the country to get away from them so thankfully he doesn\u2019t want to enable but we are asked to bail them out allllll the time.

That is not OK.", "NTA. \n\nI had a similar situation with my own mother. Won't spend her money on stuff she needs to survive but will gladly buy weed or go shopping online.

Additionally, her past failure to provide reliable childcare support, resulting in you quitting jobs, adds to your resentment.
