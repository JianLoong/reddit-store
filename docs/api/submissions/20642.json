Additionally, her past failure to provide reliable childcare support, resulting in you quitting jobs, adds to your resentment. Have a calm conversation with your boyfriend, discussing your concerns and the impact on your finances, and decide together whether to help his mother.", "NTA\n\nElectricity doesn't get turned off for a couple of late payments.

And if DPW find out she's selling those food stamps, she'll get cut off, and lose any other benefits she may be getting from the state as well.\n\nDon't give her any money, she needs to face the consequence of her actions.", "NTA, but do you and your bf have each your own money? He's free to give her his own extra money, just not yours, nor the money intended for shared expenses", "NTA. Past issues aside, she is a grown woman and responsible for her own bills. If she doesnt take care of them, then she needs to face the consequences of her actions. If she wants a loan, make her give you collateral, like the title to her car or some jewelry, so you can be sure you get the money back. This might be a hill worth dying on. Good luck.", "I\u2019m gonna go NTA on this one purely because it seems like you outlined pretty well she has a history of this and has already shorted you and your SO.", "He is trying to take from our saved money, which we have been saving for months to go on a family vacation.", "Pull out your own contribution from that immediately.", "Buy her a flashlight. NTA.", "NTA. In what world does it make sense to help someone that didn't offer to help you and showed their ass to you? LOL no, do not help this woman, and I actually think that your boyfriend is the asshole because how dare he try and fix his face to guilt trip YOU to help his sorry ass mother... sorry. I know this is your MIL, but stand your ground.", "NTA and report her for selling her food stamps\u2026we taxpayers don\u2019t need to be paying for her fraudster ass.", "Never lend any amount of money to anyone that you can\u2019t afford to lose. Never co-sign anything for anyone unless you can afford (and are willing) to pay for that item yourself. I used to work for a lending institution. When we requested co-signers for a loan or mortgage I would have a confidential chat with the co-signers and explain that 1) I do not chase their unqualified friends for money, I chase the co-signers for money. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve requested a co-signer. 2) their ability to borrow will be negatively impacted by co-signing. 3) if they want me to confidentially turn down the loan so I get the blame and not them I will do so. Most potential co-signers opted for option 3. \n\nBasically, don\u2019t set yourself in fire to keep others warm. Or keep their lights on. Don\u2019t feel guilty for saying No. For some people $100 isn\u2019t much and they can afford to write it off. For OP that isn\u2019t the case. Decline with regrets and just say you can\u2019t afford it. Force MIL to change her spending habits.

Just like she used to blame my sister and I for never having any money and it was our fault we were poor, it was our fault they felt the need to drink daily, etc. Had I not gotten out of that situation when I did, I would have gone on believing my sister and I really were to blame for all their problems and continued trying to \u2018make things right\u2019. \n\nPoint is, if his childhood was anything like mine, he\u2019s probably got an unhealthy attachment to his mom in that he constantly feels the need to please her/be there for her due to the shit parenting. He needs to be able to see how unhealthy it is, objectively. The shitty part is that it\u2019s not always easy to get someone to realize the person who raised them sucks. If he already knows she\u2019s got issues, it\u2019ll be a lot easier, but overall, that\u2019s a whole lifetime of shit to get into and he\u2019ll most certainly need some therapy to break that attachment.", "As long as her sockets still work, she can just plug in a lamp or two. Or use candles.", "NTA.  Your \"MIL\" is selfish.  She only cares about the things she wants, not the things she needs.  And doesn't give a thought to you & your boyfriend.  However, lending her this money is becoming a routine & is only enabling her.  Stand your ground on this.  Stop giving her money & let her figure it out for herself.  Weed & cigarettes are not a necessity & she needs to learn how to budget better.", "NTA, but you have bigger problems than just your MIL.", "O hell no \nNo no no no no\n\nBe careful though... if he doesn't understand this, he may just do as he wants", "NTA.  Your boyfriend's Mom doesn't care about her lights being cut off, at least not enough to pay the electric bill, so why should you?  Remind your bf that she still owes you $40 and money given to her is taken away from your actual child, who you are both responsible for (neither of you is responsible for her).", "Lots of other good points made, but I wanted to point out that if you're still in a situation where you're at risk of being late on your own payments if she doesn't pay you back right away, then you simply cannot afford to loan her the money at all. \n\nShe's in that situation specifically because she thinks simply having money means you can afford to spend it on whatever, but look where that's got her. Just because you have money for your own bills doesn't mean you have money to give her.\n\nIf your bf won't get off your back about this maybe point out that you couldn't give the money even if you wanted to, because he *knows* she's not good for it. But I agree with the other comments saying this is a deeper problem than the money. Your bf needs to get on board with cutting his mom off since she has no problem with constantly causing you guys financial hardship because she's irresponsible.\n\nNTA", "What are you doing?

OP you DO realize this isn't a situation that's going to change right?  He's expecting you to help subsidize his mother's poor financial decisions...meaning he insists you go down on that sinking ship with him.  You're either going to suck it up and continue to do so or you're going to wise up and do what you already know you have to do...what you're gut has been telling you you need to do.\n\n  What you choose to do at this point is completely on you.", "NTA- you are right. \n\nYou are not obligated to care about your bf's mother's electricity nor to pay her bills.", " Ya.
