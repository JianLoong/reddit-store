I\u2019ve had friends like this, and you\u2019re damned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t. From what I can tell, you did communicate clearly what type of behavior you would and wouldn\u2019t tolerate, and she didn\u2019t respect this boundary.

I think this is a season of your friendship where you both need healthy distance.

Case closed. You, however, are NTA.", "NTA.  This person is not your friend.  She just wants someplace to spew her negativity.", "NTA She needed to hear that ages ago. The fact that your \"friend\" has repeatedly told you that she \"hates pregnant people\" (a.k.a. YOU) tells you all you need to know. A friend is not someone you have to walk on eggshells for, hide who you are or parts of yourself, or feel responsible for emotionally. Cut your losses.", "ESH \n\nSounds like most of this could have been avoided by clear communication. You should have told your friend about your baby shower and offered for her to not go if it would be hard on her. She is suffering and as her friend you should communicate fully with her so that she knows you have her best interest at heart. She should put her own pain aside to celebrate the wonderful thing that is going on in your life."]}
