I decided not to continue. I would suggest doing what my friends did with me. (*Or the kind version of what my friends did with me*) Ask to meet for a coffee somewhere.  And ask her what she wants to do. What her plan is if she wants to keep the baby. Money, housing, childcare. Very gently tell her this isn't your baby, so her moving in with you and you two raising this child together isn't an option. Therefore if she wants to keep this baby she has to have a plan. Go through what support the government offers to low income parents, and social housing. And tell her whatever she chooses, you'll be there. If she wants someone to go with her to the Doctors or to abort, or if she wants someone to go to the welfare office or attend what hospital appointments you can. \n\nBut NTA right now she's living in a fantasy world, where she thinks you earn enough money to solve all her problems, and you two can be besties raising her child together. She needs to be brought back to reality.", "OK. Some advice form my experiences... DO NOT LET HER MOVE IN! Moving in with a friend is hard enough, but a best friend will use that line over and over again till you wonder why you're friends. It'll start small. \"Oh, OP, cant we just do XYZ?\" \"No. I'm tired.\" \"But you're my bestfriend and I wanna go.\" ... \"OP, can you get me this and that?\" \"No. I'm tight on money.\" \"But you're my bestfriend and you should.\" And it doesn't matter what your legitimate reasons are for saying no, the bestfriend card WILL be played EVERY time. And it won't stop there. \"Hey OP. I'm just so tired of being stuck indoors with the baby. Please take said baby while I go out partying\" WHICH IS WHAT CAUSED HER TO BE KNOCKED UP IN THE FIRST PLACE.\n\nNow onto what ACTUAL bestfriends should/shouldn't do. They should be there for each other. Especially when times are tough and everyone else has turned their back on them. They should NOT make their bestfriend feel guilty about things that weren't their decision in the first place. SHE went out and got drunk and got knocked up. Anything SHE does now is her choice (pro choice woman here. Don't hate me please) But to actively BLAME YOU for what SHE will choose is beyond gross for a bestfriend to do. Especially with something as delicate as a baby. (Pro choicers are never like \"Yeah. Fuck that baby.\" But we are like, \"Mom has the right to do with her body what she wants.\" And that'd be exactly it. She's not keeping the kid or getting rid of the kid BECAUSE of you. And it's shitty of her as a bestfriend to make you feel so)", "NTA. Listen, we can\u2019t always help people we like as much as they would want. That is just a basic life lesson that you have to learn. \n\nShe is not only asking some help just the time to figure things out, no she wants you to be a parent to her child. Not because she is in love you. Not because she believes you would be a good role model. But because she is scared and does not want to assume the consequences of her actions. \n\nAnd I get it\u2019s important to help our friends but this, this is just too much. \n\nSometimes when I face difficult situation I just ask myself, what will the me of the future will think of my decision. Would I be able to be okay with the choice I made ? \n\nDo you want to raise this child ? To spend your weekend taking care of him/her ? To not be able to go out, being free as much as you are right now because now your life is focused on him/her ? Saying no to her now is better than accepting and then having to say her to take her child and to leave because you can\u2019t do it anymore.\n\n(Sorry English is not my native language)", "NTA. The best thing to do in this situation is probably an abortion. You are not the father of this child and should not be expected to help your friend raise it. It also sounds like she isn\u2019t in a financial place to take this on by herself. As a friend, you should offer emotional support and comfort, but be clear that you\u2019re not in a place in your life to help raise a baby. I feel for Molly. It\u2019s a tough place to be in.", "Nta. Your friend is basically wanting you to be a second parent to her child - which is completely ridiculous.  The decison of whether or not to keep the baby or end the pregnancy is 100% your friends. Do not let yourself have your life turned upside down by a bad decision that you weren't the one to make.", "Do not light yourself on fire to keep Molly warm. She needs to deal with her issue not transfer them to you. You can't make this better for Molly, only Molly can fix Molly. \n\nNTA but if you cave and abandon all visions of the life you want for a mistake Molly made you will be an asshole.", "NAH. Do you want to house her, subsidize her and her child, and raise a child with her? Because that's what she's asking of you and it's inherently selfish. She's not considering you at all. She may be scared and in survival mode and has trauma from childhood, I'll give her that, but supporting your friend does not mean you need to sacrifice your life. \n\nI would let her down gently and use your lease as an excuse if you need to. \"I'm sorry, Molly, but I can't let you move in. It's against my lease and I could be evicted. I love you and will help you where I can, but I cannot help raise a child. I don't have the resources and I'm not able to dedicate my life to that.\" I would also suggest that she not have the baby since she's not yet ready herself.", "Let her know that you didn\u2019t mean it like that. You meant it as in she still has to try to support herself and the baby. Not you would support them all. There is a difference. She obviously isn\u2019t ready to have a baby and adoption or termination should be a consideration if she isn\u2019t even going to try.", "Tell her the Landlady doesn't want anyone else in the place and you'll be happy to help her find a better place to live, et.", "It\u2019s not your responsibility. Feel free to blame it on your landlady, say that she say no & you\u2019re not in a place to argue with her and/or move out. You wish her the best but you cannot support her in that way.", "NTA\n\nMolly is in a tough position, but none of that is your fault.  Molly has made some unfortunate choices, and now she has to make some tough choices.  I feel for Molly.\n\nBut you two raising the child together isn't the grand solution that she thinks it is, and you shouldn't agree to it.  You can help out, certainly, but you cannot commit to being Molly's stability or filling in for the second parent.  What happens in a year or two if you want to move but Molly cannot afford to live on her own with the child?   What happens if you meet someone and want to move in together, but Molly is still not independent?  If she's not able to do this independently now, how is she planning to reach independence with the additional burden of needing childcare to work AND the additional costs of having a child?   \n\nIf Molly is not in a position to raise this child solo, it's better she come to terms with that now when she has options.  She can choose to end the pregnancy, or she could choose to pursue adoption for her child.  The worst option would be bringing another human into this bad situation with a band-aid solution, then have the child pay the price for that when the band-aid inevitably falls off because this was never going to work long-term.  If your friend hates you for not putting your life on hold to bail her out of a situation you had no role in creating, then frankly she doesn't sound like a good friend.", "Help her get an abortion? NTA\u2026", "This is a moment where a lie is totally acceptable. Tell her your lease is only for you, not flatmates. You can't afford to move somewhere else either.

Foster care children already have parents or family that are trying to get their life together enough to be reunited.", "You\u2019re so right. I spoke too quickly when the person suggested adoption as \u201cthe best option for the child\u201d. I have two different friends who were adopted and the process/life has been grueling for them. It was those two friends who really hammered home to me that adoption isn\u2019t always the best option. \n\nYou\u2019re entirely correct about the foster care systems purpose being to reunite families. I apologize."]}
