But why would she break up with her boyfriend if he wasn't the one saying those things? Was he not being supportive/did he know the cousins were saying that and didn't defend her? Something doesn't add up on that end", "NTA.\n\nLook, you're not the asshole for protecting your sister's dignity. It might cost you financially, but some things are worth more than money. If the cousin was badmouthing your family like that, who knows what else was going on behind the scenes? Your sister made her decision based on new information, and it's not on you to bear the emotional burden of her choice or the financial burden of your dad's restaurant. Keep your integrity, and face the challenges as they come. You did the right thing.", "NTA. I'd want to know.", "NTA you did what you thought was best for your sister. If she\u2019s that upset then something must have been said by the boyfriend or the cousin to validate the statement. Try talking to your sister and tell her how you\u2019re feeling.", "This all sucks but if I were your sister I would be upset if you heard this and didn't tell me.  No matter what happens you showed loyalty to your sister.  Could you have done things differently/  Maybe, but I would say NTA here.", "I think this is above Reddit\u2019s pay grade honestly. I don\u2019t think you meant to, but you probably just cost your dad his business and your sister her relationship. Sometimes it\u2019s better just to let sleeping dogs lie.\n\nReddit will say NTA, but frankly, you had never heard it first hand, only had unreliable info to go on, and did so simply because you wanted to see shit go down, let\u2019s be real. You just thought it would be the cousin receiving and not you and your family. I am sorry you and everyone around you is having to learn such a harsh lesson.", "ESH.\n\nBusinesspeople don't lower tenant rent substantially below market rates for no reason, getting nothing in return.\n\nIf your sister's romantic involvement is driving the price, you've either been getting a family discount (if the relationship is serious enough to be headed that way) or your sister is basically engaging in sex work (if the relationship is imbalanced or explicitly transactional). Anything in between... Wouldn't affect the rent.\n\nYou pulled back a curtain here.\n\nThere was also no reason for the cousin to know your family was getting a deal on the rent in the first place, so... Suggests the information came from your sister's boyfriend as a crude joke.", "NTA, you were making sure she was aware of a not good person in y\u2019all\u2019s life", "NTA. She needed to know what was said before things get serious with him. And the fact that they broke is a red flag against the boyfriend. Just speculating but I'd say he didn't see the harm in this or he actively participated.", "NTA. Your sister deserved to know what was being said about her. And your family deserves to have a rent that is based on a positive business relationship, not your sister\u2019s personal life. If the rent is raised, that is not your fault- it never should have been set based on your sisters relationship and that is a terrible way of doing business as a land lord! I\u2019m sorry your sister is so upset- I can only assume that means her ex didn\u2019t defend her appropriately, so she\u2019s likely better off without him. But no matter how it went down, it\u2019s not your fault.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d definitely want to know if someone is calling me that behind my back so I know to not interact with that person again. Obviously there were other problems in their relationship anyways, because how do they break up because of what a cousin said? Did the boyfriend defend the cousin? Did the cousin confess that the boyfriend calls her names too? There\u2019s got to be more to this we didn\u2019t see. Especially since the boyfriend is mad at you for telling... he wanted to confront the cousin in secret for a reason. Probably not a good reason. \n\nThe restaurant is over anyways if your dad can\u2019t afford the rent. I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s unfortunately the truth here. Your sister dating the son to secure the restaurant is a really bad idea to rely on. They easily could\u2019ve broken up for any other reason, and then what? The owners shouldn\u2019t be holding that over anyones head anyways. Hey your daughter better date our son or else lose your business. That\u2019s really shitty.", "YTA.  You spread a questionable rumor allegedly stated by someone whose opinion doesn't matter and have dropped a nuclear bomb in your whole family.  If you absolutely needed to confront someone about it, why not talk to the cousin?", "YTA.  You tell the boyfriend first about these accusations and see if they are true or not. Then the boyfriend of your sister, not you, would be able to deal with the situation. \n\nI know you felt like you were doing the right thing, so kudos to that, but you totally messed up.", "YTA you yourself said the source was unreliable you owe some apologies", "YTA but not intentionally, more by mistake.\n\nFirst, you said that it wasn't from a reliable source, so you don't even for sure that he said it.  Next, I think her BF is right... if you would have come to him, he could have dealt with his cousin without it blowing up into a whole huge thing, or if he didn't, then you can go to her.", "YTA for not verifying claims before running your mouth. He's probably also an AH for most likely handling the confrontation poorly, leading to the breakup.", "ESH.  You for not verifying the source.  Or asking the boyfriend and/or his cousin about it.  They may not have answered truthfully but their response would have helped you with deciding if it was reliable enough to tell her.\n\nThe boyfriend sucks for thinking he should be \"handling\" her.  She's an adult who won't shatter like glass if she hears something potentially upsetting.  That sounds like code for blocking anything that may cause her to act in a way he doesn't like.\n\nAssuming this is true the boyfriend's cousin is the biggest asshole here.  He also sounds jealous.\n\nYour sister I'd give a gentle YTA to.  This is upsetting, especially with reducing her to a sex object instead of a person.  But she shouldn't break up with her boyfriend on hearsay or for something someone else said.  It would have been better if she gave herself time and space to process this information before doing anything.  Some actions can't be undone.  Words can't be unsaid.  After a few years together both she and her boyfriend deserve better.", "yea u did mess up. He used bad language but he wasnt wrong thats how the world works. Most people who are sucessful at buisness are getting a friend, family, or the ur dating/sleeping with  somene discount. and that is literally the way the world works. u so did ruin a good thing. the cousin is the a hole but in ur naiveness u really screwed ur family over and i feel itsz up to u to pay the differnce in rent if its raised as u kinda need to take accountability on this one. men are men if u run and tell everything they say u might as well stay indoors", "NTA-She had every right to know.  Her reaction is a little off, but maybe there is more than just this going on.", "YTA because you sound like you didn\u2019t really know the whole situation and you cost your family the whole farm", "YTA.

If bf really didn't know then he holds no blame. Of course it's her decision who she dates, but if he was a good man and didn't know then I'd maybe suggest she really think it through. \n\nThe only good reason (objectively, bc like I said she can do what she wants without a reason) I could see for your sister to end the relationship even if bf is good and didn't know, is if more people in bfs family feel this way. It's hard to date someone who's family is disrespectful to you. But just one shitty cousin shouldn't be hard to avoid.", "NTA.\n\nThe boyfriend's cousin was running his mouth and calling your sister a whore. You had every reason in the world to tell your sister what you had heard.\n\nYou had zero reason to go behind your sister's back to talk to her boyfriend about it.\n\nTo me, it sounds like the boyfriend is the one telling people that your dad is getting a discount on rent because of BF's relationship with your sister. It could be a lie that BF made up. Or it could be a truth that BF was never willing to tell her.\n\nEither way, it seems highly likely that BF has been calling your sister a whore behind her back.\n\nYou should not feel bad about them breaking up. And you should not wonder if you are an AH. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA, how where you to know how ur sister would react? If that company raises the rent again simply cause ur sister broke up with someone in the family, you should tell ur dad to take it up with someone who has a higher power because that is totally unfair.", "NTA.  She needed to know.  But i would talk to her, once she\u2019s calmed down, and see if she\u2019s willing to give her bf a chance to work things out\u2026especially if he truly didn\u2019t know.", "The truth is always a valid defense", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It wasn't a coincidence that they lowered rent and everyone on both sides could see the subtext.\n\nThe cousin was out of line majorly and she's in the right to be upset and defend her sister, but like, did you really think they were doing OP a favor for any other reason? They were \"family\", yeah, but only because they were dating, and they're a business transaction above all still. Once the relationship ended, there was 0 reason for them to continue keeping the rent low, and being upset that's the case is appallingly entitled and lacking in self-awareness.\n\nNo one here is \"wrong\", they're just all behaving selfishly, which is human and understandable- hence, ESH."]}
