We have a 4 year old Peter who is, obviously, mixed race. She is good with languages because of her upbringing: Urdu is her mothertongue, and her English accent is better than mine. The language she is most comfortable with is German, as all the countries her parents worked in were German speaking. \n\nJaan was keen for us to have a \"family language\". I was keen to learn Urdu, but we quickly find out I am terrible. She found it hilarious, and decided it would be less painful for us both if we switched to German - I did some at school, she taught me a lot, I attended some classes and am near fluent now.\n\nHence, Peter grew up trilingual. English (I speak to him), German (all 3 of us speak), and Urdu (she speaks to him). He''s no Shakespeare, he's 4, but speaks all 3 impressively.\n\nMy parents are proud of him, as are Jaan and I. But my SIL (also white Brit), who has a daughter Jenny 5F, is REALLY angry. She keeps telling me that we're deprioritising English and that Peter will struggle when he starts school and speak with an accent. \n\nI said that implies most ethnic kids in the UK are failures. And that Peter has a British father, and my side of the family are ALL white British -  Peter's not lacking in \"Britishness\". I called her out on the accent thing - he doesn't have one, but an accent is not a \"fault\". I don't know why she thought he'd have one btw, my wife sounds like a native speaker.\n\nCue a gathering last week. Peter was playing with Jenny, and pointed at something and said its name in all 3 languages. Jenny found that fun and kept asking him to name things in all 3, which he happily did. \n\nI thought that was a very normal interaction, but my SIL called to say she will never bring Jenny over again if I let Peter \"confuse\" her with other languages and to not let him \"show off\" in family events. She said that it was setting Jenny back, and she does not want to be disadvantaged. She said Jenny copied some words in English in \"Peter's accent\" except it's not an accent, it's just a slight lisp, many kids have it at that age.\n\nI am refusing to \"forbid\" Peter - especially as Jenny ASKED him to do it. I never want him to think my wife's language is \"inferior\" and meant to be hidden She doubled down, and accused me of sabotaging Jenny because \"you two know Peter will be discriminated against  so you want Jenny to face the same\". I said thats ridiculous: we ARE aware Peter will definitely face some discrimination, but that'll be because of his RACE, not because he speaks German lol. My brother however, has joined her side, and refuses to bring Jenny over.\n\nAITA? Should I have stopped Peter when I noticed the game, or tell him to not speak the other languages infront of my side of the family just to smooth things over? Was I disrespectful to her parenting style?\n\nEdit to add as a couple of you have asked: No, SIL does not speak any other language and has no intention to learn any as far as I know. Which I suppose is the reason why she considers German some crazy exotic tongue when in reality it's not exactly difficult for English speakers to grasp, which is why most schools here make you learn it until Year 10...", "created_utc": 1694211372, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16do273/aita_for_being_ok_with_my_baby_speaking_my_wifes/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They are jealous and their negativity will affect your son!", "NTA- Former teacher of 20 years here~ I spent the last 13 teaching English as a New Language. You are providing your child as rich a childhood as possible!! How wonderful your child will be able to communicate with so many. It will afford him opportunities you cannot even fathom right now. My dil is fluent in English and Spanish. Her father is Mexican and her mother was Caucasian. She is fully literate in both languages- can write college papers in both. She just graduated nursing school and is getting certified in medical Spanish. \n\nYour sil is definitely the ass here.

He's four and stopping him would confuse and maybe upset him. He's done nothing wrong at all.

Not sure if she is envious or just ignorant, but she sounds like an awful person.", "Was I removed for stating that the sil might be insecure and clarifying the different way she might be. So that OP doesn't blame themselves or think hir sil was necessarily racist?", "NTA. And THANK YOU for doing this for your son. Imagine the opportunities you\u2019re opening for him later in life having these language skills. Jenny is so LUCKY to learn from him. If they want to deprive her of an open mind, well, they\u2019re the ones contributing to a close-minded society where people with different accents could be discriminated against.", "NTA. Your son being tri-lingual is only a benefit for him and the people around him. Your family not liking this is to their detriment. \n\nYour sister is small-minded and seems to want to make her daughter just like her.\n\nPlease do not ever dis-encourage (not sure of a better term) your son from thinking, speaking, and learning in every language in which he is interested.\n\nI am a 3rd generation American. My Canadian grandparents didn't teach my parents French bc they didn't want them \"looked down upon\" in Boston in the 1920's to 40's.  I regret this every single day.", "Shabaash teaching your bacha so many languages. NTA", "NTA.  Sounds like your SIL is racist and is trying to hide it under the cover of language.\n\nIt's a proven fact that kids do better in school when they're multilingual at a young age.  Her arguments are based on her bias against other cultures.", "Sounds more to me like Jenny cannot handle her daughter having a smarter cousin.\n\nI speak 4 languages. It's never been a problem in my family.\n\nBut I can see the glares and whispers whenever I outshine my cousins.\n\nTell your son to keep at it. He's a polyglot in the making.", "Your kid will have such an advantage in life speaking so many languages.  Nta but your sil is a huge one!", "Oh, your SIL is going to have a major hissy fit in 6 years time when your niece learns a second language at secondary.\n\nNTA - your SIL is either ignorant or racist.

I am now nearly 40 and struggling to learn a second. \n\nNTA and your SIL and brother are at the least jealous, at worst racist.", "NTA. I speak 5 languages and understand 7, thanks to multiple languages used and taught in my home country, and a propensity to live abroad and pick up more. When I was asked how many languages I hoped my son will speak, 2, 3, my response was 8, since his dad is fluent in 3 additional languages. Your son has an amazing start to life; what a beautiful gift you give him by raising him trilingual. Don\u2019t listen to your sister. She sounds like a small minded bigot. I\u2019m just sad for her daughter. It sounds like she only just realized more than one language exists and was ready to dive in.", "Your SIL is ignorant, to say the least. I really want to say stupid, but ok. NTA.", "This is bizarre. Jenny spending time with Peter offers her a developmental advantage, and shes clearly showing an interest in language -- obscene to take that from her.", "Let me guess.

On no language do we baby talk to them.

You\u2019re NTA. She certainly is though.", "So she's mad that your toddler is smarter than her? Encourage him to speak all 3 languages. I'm bilingual (english/French- I'm Canadian) I have had more opportunities career wise for having knowledge of both languages. As for your brother and SIL, they're being dramatic. No one is confusing anyone. If Jenny picks up on either of the other 2 languages, she could become fluent eventually and the world would be her oyster. \n\nWe're raising our son bilingual. We live in the only bilingual province and I don't want him to ever miss an opportunity because he's lacking a language. Kids 5 and under actually have an easier time to pick up a second or more languages. Keep doing what you're doing. She says he'll be subject to racism because of his languages and she's the one being racist.", "NTA. Your SIL is TA. She\u2019s clearly jealous of your kid speaking several languages.", "She is probably feeling jealous and defensive because Peter will grow up multilingual and her daughter will just speak English", "NTA she\u2019s jealous big time that your kid will have a huge advantage", "NTA. Your SIL is at best xenophobic.", "NTA. Your SIL seems to be the only person who has a problem with this, and, well, that's her problem.", "How dare you expose Jenny to the reality that people from different countries speak different languages, despite the fact that she already knew this because she asked him what things were in different languages? Your SIL and brother are jealous because your son is trilingual at 4.", "Ok....just because I'm a Bridgerton fan I have to point this out. Queen Charlotte George III's wife was GERMAN. If he hadn't married a GERMAN the Royal Family would be VERY different. If Germany is good enough for the Royal Family it's good enough for yours.", "Your sister is TA not you, she seems very ignorant (maybe a hint of racism) \n\nHaving a kid that can speak multiple language is incredible and should never be discouraged, we had a friend that brought her kids up trilingual (her parents were Italian, she was brought up in Spain and then moved to Canada so learnt English to) and it was so impressive watching them jump between.", "Thank you! Yeah it's just such a shame because my parents LOVE Jaan, always call Peter a smart boy every time he tries to play \"school\" with them and teach them Urdu/German - and they practically went insane with joy at us having \"an Indian wedding\". So it stings that the first incidence of discrimination Peter ever faced in his life came at 4 years old and from someone in his own family.", "Every scientific study has found that being multilingual gives you an advantage in schooling and into adulthood.", "Call them and tell them if Jenny isn't trilingual, she can't come around Peter and confuse and bore him by only speaking one language. Explain how Peter is only comfortable in a cosmopolitan setting that includes multiple languages spoken. Wish them well.", "OP son will be tremendously advantaged, the language center of his brain is already becoming fantastically developed. He will likely find he is able to easily learn further languages thruout his life that will give him a big leg up.\n\nThose who criticize this are insane, insecure and probably bigoted/racist.\n\nSee if he likes Mandarin!", "Yeah that's exactly our line of thought, thank you! Jaan has definitely been discriminated against due to her race. And considering sometimes even I get flak for being with Jaan in public from weirdos who would probably bring back \"anti race mixing\" laws if they could, we know full well Peter will probably face some shit because of his race.  But Jaan said never in her life has anyone EVER viewed her multilingualism as anything less than super cool.", "I got out of taking high school French in Ontario in the 60s/70s (Signed up for it every term, discussed it with the teacher and got an automatic A for just not showing up to class) because my first language was French.  \n\n\nBeing bilingual has been incredibly useful all my life.", "Thank you! And yeah I really don't think saying the German word for, idk, \"window\", is exactly going to get Jenny hate crimed or kicked out of nursery school \ud83d\ude2d", "Thanks! Yeah I mean I feel the German especially gives him a huge *advantage* since UK schools require you to learn a second language until around 15, and German is such a popular and common choice that many places just straight up make it a compulsory subject. So I feel he fully has a head start on that front because of our home languages, especially when it comes to pronounciation and oral exams...", "Thank you, and exactly! Many first gen immigrants don't even speak English, yet their British born kids always sound natively British, because of schooling and the environment. So I really don't think Peter will face any issues on that front ahah", "Right? I'd be sending my kid over to OPs house as often as they let me so they could help my kid learn more languages, lol.

Learning languages is amazing for the cognitive development of children too!", "Thank you! We are actually very keen to learn Japanese together haha - can't wait till Jaan and Peter race ahead of me while I'm figuring out how to count to five.", "Yeah I'm starting to think this and it's actually somewhat likely. Some people in the UK have a stigma against German (hangover from WWII etc), and Urdu is written in Arabic script so you can guess what problem people have with that...", "Haha that's odd because I definitely use it often and have heard it used a ton... and I was born and raised balls deep in rural Oxfordshire, so as 'Limey' as one can get...", "My nephew is in French immersion, even though neither parent speaks French.  \n\n\nThey saw it purely as an advantage, because in Canada, federal government jobs require fluency in both official languages. Also, he's pretty smart, and it occurred to them that having to learn a second language keeps him from becoming bored and disruptive.  \n\n\nOTOH, because I'm the bilingual one in the family and was living with them at the time, during covid, I had to be the one who hung out with him while he Zoom-schooled.  \n\n\nNot fun for me or the kid.", "Yeah I really feel bad for her because Jenny just did something any 5 year old would do and got excited by \"funny new words\", only for her mother to lose her mind and treat them like swear words.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

No only will he be able to communicate with a multitude of people from different cultures, a lot of govt jobs require you to be at least bilingual, which could open some career doors for him. He could also tutor people for money as early as high school. The list goes on and on. Bravo for you and your wife taking this approach and giving him a such a great gift. Kudos as well for standing up for your family despite massive pushback. You are 100% NTA. Keep doing what your doing and standing firm.", "This exactly. He is doing great things for his child's brain development by exposing him to multiple languages. I work in early childhood education and teach a lot of dual language learners and I am really impressed that a 4yo who is learning 3 languages simultaneously is already speaking all 3 impressively.

I wish I could learn fluent French!", "There is a school in my state that teachers kids to become trilingual!", "Sure, but even beyond the specific language, it\u2019s so good for his brain to be bi- or tri-lingual.

You kid is going to be very, very grateful for all your effort when they grow up.\n\nCongratulations on the parenting!", "This was my thought too as I read this... him not allowing his son to speak Urdu and German will make him think of that language as a negative. The only things four year olds are told not to do are Bad or Naughty things - no colouring on walls, no throwing food, no jumping on the bed et cetera. So of course if he's told not to speak Urdu/German he will interpret it as those languages being Bad.  It would also create such an unhealthy split in his mind, separating his White Family and his Asian Family - which is just a horrible and heavy burden to put on a child that will already find it harder than most to navigate and reconcile his ethnic and racial identities.\n\nAnd OP is right, and a great husband and father, to put his foot down so firmly here in defense of his wife's language, especially because he doesn't even speak it himself. It's so refreshing to see a parent like this: most of the cross-cultural family posts on this sub are all about English speaking partners getting offended, insecure, or left out at the idea of their child and partner sharing a language they themselves can't speak.", "Unfortunately, I dont believe the sister is jealous. Just racist. They are not the same.", "Yes, sister is jealous!", " I'm dying at how the SIL is acting like OP and wife are trying to create a linguistic Frankenbaby to personally spite her, when in reality they genuinely seem to have the healthiest and most mutually respectful approach to cross-cultural relationships I have ever seen on this sub."]}
