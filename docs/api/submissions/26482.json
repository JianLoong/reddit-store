We have a 4 year old Peter who is, obviously, mixed race. She is good with languages because of her upbringing: Urdu is her mothertongue, and her English accent is better than mine. The language she is most comfortable with is German, as all the countries her parents worked in were German speaking. \n\nJaan was keen for us to have a \"family language\". I was keen to learn Urdu, but we quickly find out I am terrible. She found it hilarious, and decided it would be less painful for us both if we switched to German - I did some at school, she taught me a lot, I attended some classes and am near fluent now.\n\nHence, Peter grew up trilingual. English (I speak to him), German (all 3 of us speak), and Urdu (she speaks to him). He''s no Shakespeare, he's 4, but speaks all 3 impressively.\n\nMy parents are proud of him, as are Jaan and I. But my SIL (also white Brit), who has a daughter Jenny 5F, is REALLY angry. She keeps telling me that we're deprioritising English and that Peter will struggle when he starts school and speak with an accent. \n\nI said that implies most ethnic kids in the UK are failures. And that Peter has a British father, and my side of the family are ALL white British -  Peter's not lacking in \"Britishness\". I called her out on the accent thing - he doesn't have one, but an accent is not a \"fault\". I don't know why she thought he'd have one btw, my wife sounds like a native speaker.\n\nCue a gathering last week. Peter was playing with Jenny, and pointed at something and said its name in all 3 languages. Jenny found that fun and kept asking him to name things in all 3, which he happily did. \n\nI thought that was a very normal interaction, but my SIL called to say she will never bring Jenny over again if I let Peter \"confuse\" her with other languages and to not let him \"show off\" in family events. She said that it was setting Jenny back, and she does not want to be disadvantaged. She said Jenny copied some words in English in \"Peter's accent\" except it's not an accent, it's just a slight lisp, many kids have it at that age.\n\nI am refusing to \"forbid\" Peter - especially as Jenny ASKED him to do it. I never want him to think my wife's language is \"inferior\" and meant to be hidden She doubled down, and accused me of sabotaging Jenny because \"you two know Peter will be discriminated against  so you want Jenny to face the same\". I said thats ridiculous: we ARE aware Peter will definitely face some discrimination, but that'll be because of his RACE, not because he speaks German lol. My brother however, has joined her side, and refuses to bring Jenny over.\n\nAITA? Should I have stopped Peter when I noticed the game, or tell him to not speak the other languages infront of my side of the family just to smooth things over? Was I disrespectful to her parenting style?\n\nEdit: many of you pointed out that this is quite discriminatory/borderline racist, especially the accent thing. I had never considered that (because, as I said, my parents are so supportive that I assumed SIL and brother were also that unprejudiced). But it does make a lot of sense, especially because one of the more bizzare reasons for SIL disliking Peter speaking Urdu specifically is \"Peter looks pretty white so he would get unwanted questions about why he can speak Urdu.\" \n\nWhich is a ridiculous take on hindsight: yes Peter *is* somewhat white passing, but most White/South Asian mixed race people are vaguely white passing, especially when young. So him speaking Urdu in public wouldn't look \"weird\" because W/SA relationships are relatively common in the UK so people would just assume he's mixed race. I also do think it's kind of fucked up and skull measure-y of her to look at a four year old and establish his racialised features...", "created_utc": 1694211372, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16do273/aita_for_being_ok_with_my_baby_speaking_my_wifes/", "score": 555, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It forms pathways for learning new information at a time when the brain is more flexible (simplified concept), pathways that other people don\u2019t start until teen years when the brain is less malleable. Basically, it teaches the brain how to do something so later on in school, the brain doesn\u2019t struggle as much because it\u2019s like \u201coh, I know how to do this already because of (insert second language). \n\n2) It creates a connection to culture/family. Language is a vital way culture and community is shared. And whether your SIL likes it or not, your son has a cultural connection to somewhere not England. Learning Urdu is going to help your son when he is older if he wants to explore that connection more. It might help him to communicate with some people from his mom\u2019s side of the family or with other people from that culture. It means he would have access to texts, music, and film from that culture. And as a result, it can create a deeper/earlier access to empathy.\n\n3) Different languages process/think differently.

The fact that she's been thinking about your son looking more white speaks volumes, as does the fact that she's somehow decided her own child is at risk of discrimination simply for learning a few words from your son. I'm sorry, this woman is waving  so many red flags she's practially hosting a parade.  She's been looking for a reason to stop her daughter and your son from interacting, her own twisted values think this gives her one that doesn't make her look too bad (she's so twisted she doesn't realise it makes her look as bad as it really is).\n\nI'm deeply sorry that your brother has joined her in this, but this is racism pure and simple and you are better off without them in your life or your son's life. It sucks for Jenny though, who will be the real loser in all of this.", "Sounds like insecurity and jealousy. NTA- you hsve given Peter wonderful gifts.", "German isn't her problem, Urdu is. She's being racist,  she doesn't want her daughter to learn any of it. Nta.", "How amazing and blessed is your kid to grow up speaking three languages!! Well done parents that's fantastic and will help keep his brain flexible and adaptable as he grows a great advantage.\nYour SIL and brother are racist.\nNTA", "Your brother and sil are basically racist and are major assholes. Tell them to fuck off and get themselves better educated. Your son will have a precious gift that could open many doors for him when he is older.", "NTA. OMG, your son is privileged to grow up speaking 3 languages and it\u2019s normal kid behavior to be teaching each other languages when they know more than one. I hope you don\u2019t interfere with what the kids are doing naturally. Please don\u2019t let SIL put limits on your child\u2019s behavior \u2014 that is not OK. Not sure if your SIL is one of those people who \u201cdoes her own research\u201d or if she even knows what research is, but none of the statements you attribute to her make any sense.  I hope this doesn\u2019t splinter your family, but you hold your ground\u2014you\u2019re doing the right thing.", "NTA  Your kid sounds awesome.   'Most ethnic kids are failures', what!  Does your SIL not know the UK has an ethnic prime minister!!!", "Exactly. She is a garden variety racist who OP should just ignore. NTA", "This is the prime time for your child to learn languages. I suggest you throw in a couple more. There is nothing negative about him knowing multiple languages. In fact, when he is older it will look great on a resume!\n Your SIL is racist. Don't listen to anything she says. NTA", "Exactly. Plus Peter will be FINE in school language wise, lots of kids start school with some \"disadvantage\"(don't want to call it that but I can't find a better word, if anyone knows something else, please tell me because it bugs me), and they will learn new words etc so fast it makes your head spin. After that, they're all very much at the same level. At least.\n\nAnd yeah, a lisp is not an accent and usually goes away on it's own. If it doesn't, there's always speach therapy. Because it's not a language issue, it's a mouth/tongue movement issue that many kids at some point have. \n\nNTA. You brother and SIL sound racist af and I feel sorry for your son and niece that they can't enjoy each other's company anymore because of it. I hope they will see how wrong they are at some point and stop that nonsense and apologize.", "Yes, NTA. He has a great advantage, and I wouldn't be surprised if they are actually jealous.", "Thank you so much! Yes we try to chat to him in each language equally... SIL acts like we're forcing him to learn it all to seem like a prodigy vis a vis those viral \"toddler speaks 30 languages\" videos. Ironically we only introduced the languages so young because it'll be much *easier* at this age and he won't have to put in prodigy level effort haha. I am very proud of him for doing so well but it's not some crazy gifted kid labour like she implies... most kids outside the Anglosphere grow up with 2+ languages, and even Prince William's daughter could speak 3 at Peter's age.", "I wrote this before I even read the edit at the bottom. Damn.", "NTA but put some clear distance in.", "I\u2019m American and really hate that we aren\u2019t raised multilingual in general. It is such a huge advantage in life to know multiple languages. It also opens pathways to easier language learning in the future. \n\nMy son is in a bilingual school and I am envious he has this opportunity! I wish I could\u2019ve taught him when he was younger, but I don\u2019t have the knowledge because I was never taught!\n\nWhat you are doing for your son is extremely beneficial. Please don\u2019t let anyone tell you different. Your SIL is extremely ignorant.", "It\u2019s probably racism mixed in with jealousy that her kid can\u2019t speak 3 languages, she\u2019s bitter that she can\u2019t provide the same as what you and your wife are doing, so she\u2019s lashing out at a 4 year old.", "OP... do you think this may be it? Your parents praise Peter, call him a smart boy... probably brag about how smart he is to everyone, including SIL. While I agree she's being racist, I think the root of this is raging insecurity. That Peter is the favored grandchild, and that he is smarter than Jenny because he can speak 3 languages (or, at the least, that your parents *think* he is smarter). I bet she's actually not that stupid (your SIL, that is) and is aware how beneficial knowing multiple languages is for kids, how it puts them ahead of other kids, etc... but SIL is limited because she only speaks English, and can't give that sort of gift to her kid. She's projecting.", "NTA - You should not have to gag your child when around adults. Their fear is ignorance and a good example of how our country and religion has become so narrow minded. A four year old is much smarter than you think...talk this out with him. Prayers for a good outcome.", "I'm sorry for you, your wife and your son you're receiving this from family. Not only is it incredibly racist, but maybe it's also coming from an place insecurity, of them feeling inferior... Because they can only understand one language. You'll find that you will get the most amount of grief about languages and speaking by people who can only speak one... You are most certainly NTA because you're son is able to speak 3 languages at a young age... You're doing him a HUGE favor.", "NTA you and your wife are great parents and set Peter up for a better life by teaching him languages. It will be an advantage when he looks for a job and in general when seeing a movie trust me.\n\nIgnore the racists and poor niece", "And the younger a child is starting to learn other languages the better. Isn't age under school start perfect for them if Remember correctly?\n\nIt's SIL who have a problem here not OP or his side of the family.", "It protects the brain from dementia", "Job for sure", "This. You're doing a great thing for your son.", "Not only this but OP and his wife sound like they are following well accepted methods of language acquisition for children which reduces any mix up. Mix ups naturally happen when little children are learning their first language (why we have English classes and early grammar classes), but I have read quite a bit about it because I want to make sure my kids also get close to that experience and they seem to aligning well with the accepted literature.", "I\u2019m an English language teacher and for me it\u2019s important my students remain connected to their home languages. [Here](https://www.britishcouncil.es/sites/default/files/british-council-parents-guide-to-bilingualism-en-2016.pdf) is a report from the British Council summarising decades of research into bi-, tri- and multilingualism. I find it an interesting read and it just goes to prove your sister has no idea what she\u2019s talking about.", "More languages = More fun!  \n\nYou and your wife are doing your son a great favor.  Think of all the places he'll be able to go and enjoy himself.  Also, think of all the places he'll be able to ask for directions, help, etc.  There are English speakers all over the world, Urdu speakers all over the world, and German speakers all over the world.  No matter where he goes, there's a good chance he'll be able to find someone he can communicate with.  You're bringing more happiness and safety into his life.", "Knowing multiple languages is honestly the coolest thing, I WISH I did! I know bits and pieces of Italian, Spanish and French and can kind of pick up context when it\u2019s written but damn would be cool to be fluent. Not only is it beneficial later in life, but from what I understand it helps with learning and thinking in general. You and your wife sound cool!", "The more languages the better! You\u2019re giving your child such a wonderful advantage. I\u2019m married to someone who is not the same race as me. My kids will learn 2 languages. I will give them as many advantages as I can. Your sister in law is a lunatic. Plus, biracial babies are the cutest \u2764\ufe0f", "OP, NTA. I had a family member who was also \u201cconcerned\u201d when my mother spoke to me in her native language and feared us kids wouldn\u2019t learn English. The family doctor encouraged my mom to continue speaking her native tongue with us and she did. I know English just fine. Family member was mostly upset they couldn\u2019t understand what we were saying.", "I think your SIL is both racist and insanely jealous. She hates that your kid is younger but has three languages compared to hr daughters one. Then is layering on some lovely racism. Shame your son doesn\u2019t get to hang out with his cousin but you definitely don\u2019t want to expose him to those behaviours.", "Mine offered German and Urdu (Bradford) so a couple of free GCSEs there!", "He won\u2019t. Noam Chomsky (one of the most prominent linguists in terms of grammar acquisition) calls children \u201clanguage acquisition devices\u201d because human brains are wired to learn whatever language or languages they\u2019re exposed to. It seems that this language faculty works quite well up to puberty. Before that, children can become native speakers. After that, well, we all know how challenging learning a second language can be.", "I'm in my 60s and am trying to leaen Japanese.

Well done to you and your wife for giving Peter such a great opportunity \ud83d\ude0a", "French is the language to know in Cananda.  Is it not taught in school over there?", "She's racist.\nI doubt, it's Peter speaking German and teaching some words to his cousin that sets her off. It's the Urdu.\nBut I am absolutely sure SIL wouldn't mind if Peter taught Jenny some words in  a \"white-european\" language.\nSIL is racist and so ist the brother.", "I\u2019m bilingual and my similarly bilingual little kid cousin is being raised on kids shows in both languages.\n\nWith YouTube now, it would be so easy too", "This also means that SIL is TA as well as ignorant and holding back Jenny by not exposing her to other languages and restricting her like this. I'm pretty sure Peter will go further in life than Jenny as a result.", "I mean damn, becoming trilingual is what our entire high school system is about (more actually, as we learn Dutch, English, German and French, so quadruplelingual?). And learning languages is so hard later in life, this kid is blessed.", "I think she\u2019s both\u2014probably more racist than jealous but she\u2019s probably comparing kids and is ticked that he\u2019s younger and already accomplished", "Oh I\u2019m sure the SIL will be more than fine with Jenny learning French and German later on. SIL has ingrained racism towards the \u201cinferior\u201d races and by default is picking at Peter for being so different and remarkable.", "Meanwhile SIL is punishing poor Jenny for engaging in basic play that explores the wonders of language.", "moreso because languages are pretty common in british schools and many students learn one or two in their early stages of education"]}
