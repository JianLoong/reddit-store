It\u2019s really annoying and I\u2019m so sick of it, but the family always kinda laughs and jokes about it.\n\nMy cousin was getting married. Ceremony was due to start at 5. I live on the opposite side of town from my Mom, but close to the venue. I did not want to pick her up for 2 reasons- 1) it would require driving all the way across town just to drive back across to the venue. 2) I knew she\u2019d be late which would make me late, and I hate being late. So instead I paid for her Uber (my Mom drives btw; she just didn\u2019t want to because of the party afterwards). I told her exactly what time the Uber would arrive and stressed multiple times when she\u2019d have to leave. I even padded it by around 30 minutes which, even if she burned the 30, she still would\u2019ve arrive about 15m early. So what happens? She missed the Uber by making him wait too long. They held up the ceremony by 45minutes for her to arrive and it was so awkward and everyone was pissed. My sibling was pissed at me and said I should\u2019ve picked her up and made her be on time. Everyone else was pissed at me too. I ended up having a bad night because everyone was giving me crap for not driving her.

Your mom is an adult who is responsible for her own actions, and you definitely did your due diligence in giving her the tools to get there on time.", "NTA  - Sure... blame everyone but the person actually responsible.", "NTA. You paid for her Uber (which, btw, was exceedingly gracious of you).\n\nHer inability to manage her time is her own fault. And she felt the full force of it by missing her Uber.\n\nIt's not your responsibility to make sure she gets anywhere on time. It's all hers. No one has any call to be mad at you as you did everything reasonable here...even more, in my opinion.", "NTA \n\nIt was their choice to delay the wedding to cater to her chronic lateness. Maybe if they\u2019d stuck to the original time your mom would\u2019ve learnt a valuable lesson", "NTA.  \"and made her be on time.\"  Seriously, how would that have worked?  You simply pick her up and carry her to your car?  If she is not going to be on time for the Uber Driver when you padded the time with 30 minutes, I imagine it would be even worse if you were there in person, as she obviously has no respect for your time.  You would have had to leave, too, just like the Uber driver.\n\nETA:  Why did they hold up the ceremony for her?  It's not like she is the parent of the bride or groom and everyone knows her reputation for lateness.  They should stop coddling her and maybe she'd learn to be on time.  Why be on time when she can get attention for showing up late?", "NTA the issue is people wait, and cater to her, and so she keeps doing it. If she has missed the wedding or something else she might learn. Not your responsibility. She can get her own uber or drive or one of them can get her.", "NTA. You did a normal thing, and your mom is being selfishly late", "NTA they should have started without her. If she cared, she\u2019d have been on time. Your entire family catering to her being disrespectful and not showing up on time isn\u2019t your fault. This is ridiculous!! She ruined a wedding and they\u2019re mad at YOU?", "NTA.

It's not your responsibility to make sure she's punctual.", "NTA and people should stop catering to her tardiness. Perhaps she'll then learn there are consequences to her being late.", "I say NTA. \n\nIf she was looking for a sober driver because she knew that she would drink at the party after, that's definitely wise. But you're not her chauffer and it would have been impractical, by the sounds, to pick her up when you were closer to the ceremony to begin with.   \n\n\nAnd it's not like you left her stranded without a ride. You arranged for an Uber (which she could have done herself, if she had wanted to) to pick her up. And gave her an arrival time that would give her 30 extra minutes of wiggle room (anticipating her lateness).   \n\n\nIt's not your fault that she, a grown ass woman, wasn't there in time and the Uber driver drove away. And if family members are so upset that she was late and should have have someone to pester her into being on time, maybe they should have been the ones to do so.", "NTA - You trying to help her , tell the others to do for themselfs", "NTA. Your mom pulls this crap because people let her get away with it. If your cousin was so irked, she should have started the ceremony on time.", "NTA, NTA, NTA-your sibling got upset at you? Why couldn\u2019t they pick your mom up? \n\nThere was nothing you could have done. You need to tell your Mom that SHE owes everyone an apology and clarify that this was entirely her own fault.

She is a grown woman for crying out loud! If she's capable of birthing and raising kids to adulthood, she is capable of being on time. It isn't difficult. She is selfish and is causing people undue stress and making their events about her because people worry about her timekeeping when that's nobody else's problem. If someone like her was part of my family, I'd refuse to invite her to any family gatherings anymore to prevent stress and to teach her a lesson. If she gets butthurt out of being left out then maybe it will encourage her to grow the hell up and be a normal grown adult for once in her life.", "You're NTA. Why is your family acting as though you're the only one who could have picked up your mom if they're that concerned?

I realize that to people for whom being on time is generally easy, this is baffling, but I swear it\u2019s true.  Being late to your kid\u2019s wedding is bad, yeah; she should have made that her one and only priority for that day.  But thing is, that is the only strategy I have ever found to be somewhere definitely on time - you make that the only thing that matters, for as long as necessary to accomplish that.  You skip breakfast, you lose sleep, you spend money on conveniences, you show up maybe a little less put-together than intended, but you get there.  You can do that for one day for a wedding, and OP\u2019s mom should have.  You can\u2019t do that all the time for everything, though - sooner or later the stuff you\u2019re rushing or de-prioritizing catches up and turns into the thing you have no choice but to deal with right now.  \n\nSome people - most people - seem to have an ability to manage time that is honestly like magic to me.  I have tried.  My brain just does not do that.  \n\nI can meet deadlines at work and such because at work, all I have to do is work.  It is finite, contained.  Life in general is not.  \n\nOP is NTA, but have pity on us late folks, I swear it stresses us more than it does you.", "I don\u2019t know you anymore than what you said but as someone who has lived with this my whole life I\u2019m begging you to change.

And I never just silence them. I snooze, knowing I have 10 minutes to get that step done.

I\u2019ve missed flights, lost out on job opportunities, had to reschedule medical appointments, messed up first dates, etc, etc.  I have spent my entire working life needing to be so good at whatever job I have, so willing to go above and beyond, to do the work nobody wants, and so on, that I make myself valuable enough that my employer is willing to deal with me being a little late fairly often.  At this point I have an alphabet-soup of mental health diagnoses (not just for this, obviously, this is just one tiny piece) so that helps in terms of employers being tolerant.
