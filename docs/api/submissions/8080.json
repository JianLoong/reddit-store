Perhaps weeks or months ago. Clearly she needs coping skills. Her avoiding dad situations is not healthy and is damaging to others.", "NTA, in my books you are a good friend. Friends should be able to tell the truth to each other, otherwise what's the point? Maybe you should reach out and ask if she wants help finding the right therapy/grief counselor for her. She doesn't have to do this by herself, but after 8 years, the path should be about moving forwards and not staying stuck in the past.", "NTA. After 8 years I would definitely be getting suspicions she's doing it for attention and drama rather than genuine grief. Why did she not just leave the film if it upset her so? Why does she have to bang on about how bad she has it every time someone else tries to vent? From what you have said, it's perfectly likely she uses it as a method of demanding attention instead of any grief-related issues.", "My dad died 10 years ago. I was 22 and it was sudden. It was devastating, and I'm so grateful to my friends for getting me through the worst of it. I still occasionally have an \"I miss my daddy\" moment, or tear up watching a father-daughter dance, but I would never even dream about faulting others for having a living father. That's just ridiculous.  People have fathers. Also, fathers die. If something triggers a tear, I actually welcome it. It reminds me to not forget all the good times. This friend of yours sounds unhinged.\n\nNTA \n\nI don't even think your delivery was that bad. It needed to be impactful enough to get through to her. And if she chooses to stop being friends over this, doesn't sound like you're missing much. She'd be setting you free.", "I'm going with NTA but your delivery could have been much kinder. I understand getting frustrated after dealing with this for so long, but it might be more helpful to say something like \"I understand a lot of things can be triggering after what you went through. I'm concerned about you and I think a therapist could help you navigate these triggers better than I can, I don't have the capacity to do it because I'm not a professional\" and apologize for being harsh if you want to preserve the friendship.", "NAH\n\nYou have a valid point that it is unreasonable to continue to be that sensitive or step on egg shells over the loss of their father after 8 years.\n\nShe is allowed and entitled to her own grieving process.

Grief never really leaves us, but as time goes on, we have to learn how to live with that grief. 8 years is way too long to be this affected by his death this intensely. Of course, when memories come up or moments like being walked down the aisle will bring up some emotions. However, reacting so harshly to a character that happens to have a dead dad is unusual. With the constant avoidance of confronting these emotions of grief, she kinda stunted her emotional growth. \n\n\nI can say confidently that after my fathers death, I would get emotional at movies that referenced death or parental death.

It\u2019s unfair for her to expect others to be held hostage to her unmanaged feelings of grief.

My dad died 4 years ago and I hate how many milestones he is missing while my brother and I are growing into actual adults. But I refuse to be held back by that and my dad would be devastated if I would still grieve him that deeply. I did go to therapy immediately after and worked through it, now I love talking about him with my family. I also have a friend whose father died about two years earlier and she is a lot like your friend. My ex\u2019s mom died 5 years ago and he refused to work through the trauma, which eventually led to our breakup. As someone who knows both sides: she is allowed to grieve, even 8 years after. But she is dragging herself down and you with her. There\u2019s a point where people can\u2019t be helped any longer. You can not walk on egg shells any time you\u2019re with her and she can not expect other people to never acknowledge fathers anymore. Honestly, when I see fathers with their young daughters it tugs at my heart strings, because losing my dad was the worst thing I ever went through but you gotta move on from the pain at some point and start turning it into something better.", "NTA she\u2019s made it her entire personality, she very much needs both a wake-up call and then loads of therapy", "Ask her to watch swiss army man with you", "NTA but your friend needs a therapist.

Maybe it's time to just walk away from this relationship.", "NTA - FWIW, you're still being supportive.

She shut down for the next 20 years of life. \n\nCould not mention it, would scream, cry, yell, threaten suicide, especially bad times were during ANY holiday (Christmas, mothers day, Easter, Thanksgiving, birthdays, all of em). I was 4 when it happened and delt with that for then on as we had no one else and my dad shut down and never helped me. It was awful always worried about mentioning something out loud that would trigger her, or a movie would, or song, or basically anything sometimes. I was always on edge as a kid and as a result still am with tons of anxiety and ptsd. \n\nOP, I understand how exhausting it is. I spent so many times as a little child breaking into rooms to get my mom because she was saying she would hurt herself, and crying on my shoulder and telling me how much she wanted to die daily. \n\nIt was hard at like age 6 hearing this, but she only calmed down telling me things and didn't get help till I forced her when I was 18, and only got better when I was around 24/25 finally on meds. \n\nNTA, your friend needs to realize she needs to get help with her grief, or it is going to drive those helping to resentment or leaving.

It\u2019s fresher so it makes sense she\u2019s still grieving him. That said, her unwillingness to cope better is a problem and she can\u2019t keep dragging people down with her or controlling how others live with her grief. OP, NTA. Cardborn, some good points but remember that grieve isn\u2019t linear.", "OP is absolutely NTA. I agree with a majority of your comment, but I do disagree that OP should make suggestions to her friend about how to grieve/\"honor\" her father. Sure, comments like that often come from a good place with the best intentions, but I doubt someone that is in a clear grief spiral would respond very well to someone else telling them what they think they should do to adjust/cope - especially if the comment is coming from a friend who (presumably) is not in the dead parents club. Losses that happen unexpectedly and/or earlier than what we perceive as \"normal\" often come hand-in-hand with a lifetime of missed events and milestones that we normally expect to share with that person. The reason for the death also plays a big role and can result in unresolved trauma. It's also very isolating if you do not have anyone in your life who can relate to losing a parent at a young, developmental age. However, the friend needs to learn how to cope - she also needs to be the one to take ownership of how to do that. It's a  tough lesson to learn. In the meantime, OP and the rest of their friends are fully within their right to make and maintain their own boundaries.\n\nAlthough the friend's feelings there are valid, she needs to accept that her feelings are her responsibility alone. It is completely unreasonable to expect everyone around you to be hyper-mindful of all of your triggers, even to avoid discussing their own fathers or monitoring if certain shows, movies, songs, etc will have any references to dead parents. True friendships do not involve walking on eggshells 24/7. It is okay for OP's friend to have certain emotional reactions to some content (that will likely happen here and there throughout her life), but not to take out her grief on others or blame them for \"causing\" it. It also sounds like the frequency that this is happening is very unhealthy. I hope she seeks out some professional guidance from a therapist who specializes in grief to address that.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree that OP's friend clearly needs to learn healthier ways of \"living with\" her grief. Losing a parent during adolescence is incredibly painful, but the responsibility is absolutely on her to figure out her own limits, learn how to communicate in a healthy manner about them (not to expect her friends to be her own content-filter for movies/shows/etc), and learn how to be equally as supportive to her friends for their own struggles without dragging her dead parent into the equation.", "It\u2019s like Vonnegut used to say, laughter is easier to mop up than tears.", "The Op's friend is a woman.

I will admit I was an emotional little shit and was angry a lot the first couple years. I always immediately apologized to my friends and tried to be better.

I got help, I got therapy.  I decided I wanted to live on and be happy as my son would want me to.  8 years is too long for her to be holding in that grief.  She needs to find some help and move on.", "NTA. I'm very sorry that your friend lost her father so early in life. You didn't mention her extended family, so I wonder if the rest of her family has been unsupportive and if she dumps her pain on all of you because you are the only safe people for her.\n\nBut! She is an adult, and she needs to take care of herself. Would her father want this for her? For his daughter to shut herself down emotionally and push others away? A loving father would want his daughter to remember him, but to embrace the potential and beauty of her own life.\n\nThe past 8 years of accommodating her pain have not helped her, so maybe setting a boundary like you did would have. Or maybe it won't. But at this point, what do you have to lose?", "It sounds like you have been your friends therapist and support group and its finally taken its toll on you.

I would be sympathetic but it angered me to no end because I just needed a friend. At 17, I realized that no one truly cared (negative environment, city, and family). I self taught myself how to deal with my depression and my triggers, but I honestly never pushed my triggers on anyone.
