At the time I did my best to try support her through it and be there for her. I think I mostly still do that now. \n\nHowever I believe that she has coped with it very badly. Not her fault I know. But it\u2019s getting to a point where it\u2019s unmanageable. \n\nWe can\u2019t watch any film where someone dies. If we do accidentally, she goes into a state of sadness for the rest of the day and won\u2019t speak to anyone. \n\nAnytime someone mentions their dad, in like a casual sense, she gets upset and calls us insensitive. Last year, she wanted to hangout with me and I told her I couldn\u2019t because it was Father\u2019s Day. She got upset about that.  \n\nEvery time someone\u2019s having a bad day and opens up about it, it can\u2019t compare to her bad day because at least our dad is still alive. \n\nI tried to be supportive but it\u2019s been getting exhausting. \n\nA couple of days ago we watched a film in which the main character has a dead dad. She got upset with me that I had let her watch that film. I told her that it was her responsibility if she didn\u2019t want to watch something to look it up beforehand. I then told her that her behaviour was getting exhausting and that I couldn\u2019t do this anymore.  If she didn\u2019t want to lose her friends then she\u2019d have to start working on herself. \n\nShe hasn\u2019t texted me since and I know she\u2019s really angry at me.

Perhaps weeks or months ago. Clearly she needs coping skills. Her avoiding dad situations is not healthy and is damaging to others.", "NTA, in my books you are a good friend. Friends should be able to tell the truth to each other, otherwise what's the point? Maybe you should reach out and ask if she wants help finding the right therapy/grief counselor for her. She doesn't have to do this by herself, but after 8 years, the path should be about moving forwards and not staying stuck in the past.", "NTA. After 8 years I would definitely be getting suspicions she's doing it for attention and drama rather than genuine grief. Why did she not just leave the film if it upset her so? Why does she have to bang on about how bad she has it every time someone else tries to vent? From what you have said, it's perfectly likely she uses it as a method of demanding attention instead of any grief-related issues.", "My dad died 10 years ago. I was 22 and it was sudden. It was devastating, and I'm so grateful to my friends for getting me through the worst of it. I still occasionally have an \"I miss my daddy\" moment, or tear up watching a father-daughter dance, but I would never even dream about faulting others for having a living father. That's just ridiculous.  People have fathers. Also, fathers die. If something triggers a tear, I actually welcome it. It reminds me to not forget all the good times. This friend of yours sounds unhinged.\n\nNTA \n\nI don't even think your delivery was that bad. It needed to be impactful enough to get through to her. And if she chooses to stop being friends over this, doesn't sound like you're missing much. She'd be setting you free.", "I'm going with NTA but your delivery could have been much kinder. I understand getting frustrated after dealing with this for so long, but it might be more helpful to say something like \"I understand a lot of things can be triggering after what you went through. I'm concerned about you and I think a therapist could help you navigate these triggers better than I can, I don't have the capacity to do it because I'm not a professional\" and apologize for being harsh if you want to preserve the friendship.", "NAH\n\nYou have a valid point that it is unreasonable to continue to be that sensitive or step on egg shells over the loss of their father after 8 years.\n\nShe is allowed and entitled to her own grieving process.

Grief never really leaves us, but as time goes on, we have to learn how to live with that grief. 8 years is way too long to be this affected by his death this intensely. Of course, when memories come up or moments like being walked down the aisle will bring up some emotions. However, reacting so harshly to a character that happens to have a dead dad is unusual. With the constant avoidance of confronting these emotions of grief, she kinda stunted her emotional growth. \n\n\nI can say confidently that after my fathers death, I would get emotional at movies that referenced death or parental death.

Cardborn, some good points but remember that grieve isn\u2019t linear.", "OP is absolutely NTA. I agree with a majority of your comment, but I do disagree that OP should make suggestions to her friend about how to grieve/\"honor\" her father. Sure, comments like that often come from a good place with the best intentions, but I doubt someone that is in a clear grief spiral would respond very well to someone else telling them what they think they should do to adjust/cope - especially if the comment is coming from a friend who (presumably) is not in the dead parents club. Losses that happen unexpectedly and/or earlier than what we perceive as \"normal\" often come hand-in-hand with a lifetime of missed events and milestones that we normally expect to share with that person. The reason for the death also plays a big role and can result in unresolved trauma. It's also very isolating if you do not have anyone in your life who can relate to losing a parent at a young, developmental age. However, the friend needs to learn how to cope - she also needs to be the one to take ownership of how to do that. It's a  tough lesson to learn. In the meantime, OP and the rest of their friends are fully within their right to make and maintain their own boundaries.\n\nAlthough the friend's feelings there are valid, she needs to accept that her feelings are her responsibility alone. It is completely unreasonable to expect everyone around you to be hyper-mindful of all of your triggers, even to avoid discussing their own fathers or monitoring if certain shows, movies, songs, etc will have any references to dead parents. True friendships do not involve walking on eggshells 24/7. It is okay for OP's friend to have certain emotional reactions to some content (that will likely happen here and there throughout her life), but not to take out her grief on others or blame them for \"causing\" it. It also sounds like the frequency that this is happening is very unhealthy. I hope she seeks out some professional guidance from a therapist who specializes in grief to address that.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree that OP's friend clearly needs to learn healthier ways of \"living with\" her grief. Losing a parent during adolescence is incredibly painful, but the responsibility is absolutely on her to figure out her own limits, learn how to communicate in a healthy manner about them (not to expect her friends to be her own content-filter for movies/shows/etc), and learn how to be equally as supportive to her friends for their own struggles without dragging her dead parent into the equation.", "It\u2019s like Vonnegut used to say, laughter is easier to mop up than tears.", "The Op's friend is a woman.

Everytime we've tried suggesting grief counseling or therapy in general (her mother has caused a lot of emotional hurt and, again she's suffers from a pretty debilitating physically disability which she will have for the rest of her life), she explodes at us, saying we don't understand her grief or pain and so on.\n\nIt's a hard road to tread, but you are NTA to your friend for suggesting she go to therapy to help her process her father's passing.", "NTA.

I found out later she'd gone to the school's counselor to ask how she could support me, knowing I wouldn't want to go myself. \n\nAnd it eased. I missed him. I thought of him.
