At the time I did my best to try support her through it and be there for her. I think I mostly still do that now. \n\nHowever I believe that she has coped with it very badly. Not her fault I know. But it\u2019s getting to a point where it\u2019s unmanageable. \n\nWe can\u2019t watch any film where someone dies. If we do accidentally, she goes into a state of sadness for the rest of the day and won\u2019t speak to anyone. \n\nAnytime someone mentions their dad, in like a casual sense, she gets upset and calls us insensitive. Last year, she wanted to hangout with me and I told her I couldn\u2019t because it was Father\u2019s Day. She got upset about that.  \n\nEvery time someone\u2019s having a bad day and opens up about it, it can\u2019t compare to her bad day because at least our dad is still alive. \n\nI tried to be supportive but it\u2019s been getting exhausting. \n\nA couple of days ago we watched a film in which the main character has a dead dad. She got upset with me that I had let her watch that film. I told her that it was her responsibility if she didn\u2019t want to watch something to look it up beforehand. I then told her that her behaviour was getting exhausting and that I couldn\u2019t do this anymore.  If she didn\u2019t want to lose her friends then she\u2019d have to start working on herself. \n\nShe hasn\u2019t texted me since and I know she\u2019s really angry at me.

People die.\n\nIf she projects this kind of need for control (\u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have shown her a movie\u201d), she does need some help managing, or to take some personal accountability for her sensitivity.

I hope she gets the therapy and the coping skills she needs in order to find some happiness.", "NTA. She should look into grief counseling/camps.", "I would say NTA, \n\nIt happened 8 years ago and she still finds it unbearable to watch a movie where someone has a dead dad?\n\nBlaming you for putting on a movie which the character has a dead dad in it is hardly your fault. Unless it was a main plot development no one would have felt the need to research that before hand.\n\nThis is a 23 year old grown woman we are talking about here, she has no by-ball for getting mad at other people for mentioning anything to do with fathers, it\u2019s kind of ridiculous and i\u2019m sure makes everyone else feel anxious around her.", "NTA. You are right to suggest your friend seek help.", "NTA - everyone has a breaking point and you e reached yours. There\u2019s grief and then there is this. Your friend is expecting everyone to live according to her random extreme emotional reactions to arbitrary things that by and large wouldn\u2019t cause this type of conduct.\n\nIt feels very attention seeking and controlling. So ya, you\u2019re right. She does need to seek help for her own benefits. \n\nThe world doesn\u2019t revolve around her trauma but 8 years on and she\u2019s still trying to get it to do so. Which makes me think something else is going on and it\u2019s not healthy coping anymore. Being at the hands of these experiences for so long is exhausting.\n\nI\u2019d continue doing what you\u2019re doing. Worrying less about how she feels and more about how the way she\u2019s treating you is making you feel. I\u2019d stop coddling her because it\u2019s basically reinforcing that it\u2019s ok that she treats you this way. By setting up those boundaries she may decide she\u2019s not getting what she wants from you (which at this point I feel is less about friendship and more about control and validation, a feeling of superiority). Let her leave. \n\nIf she does you\u2019ll grieve too, but over time after losing someone who refuses to treat you better you\u2019ll realize a weight has been lifted and your life is better for it. A double edge sword because it\u2019s sad it had to be that way but also better because it is. Which is sad. \n\nAnyways, keep that boundary in place. It\u2019s on her to decide if she wants to continue being in your life and you\u2019ve set a more than reasonable standard in order for her to do so.", "8 years?...\n\nYou've been putting up with this for 8 years?\n\nThere's too many layers to this insane sense of entitlement to even get into it.. sounds like your friend is addicted to their own drama.\n\nNta.", "NTA - it\u2019s been 8 years. She has had a lot of time to grieve and seek help. It was better for you to be honest and hurt her feelings rather than pulling away from her without explaining why, which would have also hurt her feelings.", "The thing about grief is that usually that kind of misery doesn\u2019t love company\u2014meaning that those that are truly grieving typically don\u2019t implicate others in their grief by limiting everyone else\u2019s lives. \n\nSometimes, there are people who like the attention that an unfortunate situation provides for them. It sounds like this is the most likely case. You were absolutely entitled to say what you said. It was time to address it.\n\nNTA.", "NAH. \n\nI'm assuming the best of your friend here and that she hasn't just been trying to manipulate you for the last decade (almost).\n\nYou gave her an unexpected truth, which makes her feel attacked. FWIW you could have done so in a more tactful way.\n\nYou've given her time. While her grief is understandable and valid, she needs to find a way to deal with that grief and she didn't seem to understand either that or how it is affecting the people around her. \n\nShe really should have been in some sort of grief therapy when this happened as a minor, assuming that she hasn't been, she needs to start.", "\" If she didn\u2019t want to lose her friends then she\u2019d have to start working on herself.\"\n\nNTA  She needs some honest and open feedback.

Grief fucks us all in different ways and this is sad but she needs help.", "NTA. She needs help. There are therapists who specialize in grief work, support groups, some grad schools even have free services. You were right to bring it up - maybe it was a little harsh in the moment, but if it gets her moving in the right direction after 8 years of this, then it will have been worth it. If not, then you know she's more interested in staying stuck in this form of her grief than her friendship with you.", "Nah. She needs to learn some coping skills. I can only imagine how hard it is, but unfortunately death is the only guarantee in life and refusing to cope with it isn't healthy. \nThat being said however, maybe you could have been gentle about it? Suggest that she honor her dad by living her life to the fullest and loving each day because we never know when it will be the last. Grief is hard and it's okay to have certain days that it hurts more than others.", "NTA - maybe what you said was harsh, but given how its been 8 years not so much.", "NTA, she might be grieving but this is too much, your response could have been better but yea she needs to understand the world isn\u2019t going to treat her as queen just cause her dad is dead", "Nope, you are NTA.  If she wants to avoid certain things for the rest of her life (healthy or not) that is solely on her.  She needs to check or avoid situations with her triggers, again if avoidance is her choice (a whole different conversation,) not expect others to do these things for her.", "NTA, but you should have had this discussion at a neutral time, not when either of you were emotional. Perhaps weeks or months ago. Clearly she needs coping skills. Her avoiding dad situations is not healthy and is damaging to others.", "NTA, in my books you are a good friend. Friends should be able to tell the truth to each other, otherwise what's the point? Maybe you should reach out and ask if she wants help finding the right therapy/grief counselor for her. She doesn't have to do this by herself, but after 8 years, the path should be about moving forwards and not staying stuck in the past.", "NTA. After 8 years I would definitely be getting suspicions she's doing it for attention and drama rather than genuine grief. Why did she not just leave the film if it upset her so? Why does she have to bang on about how bad she has it every time someone else tries to vent? From what you have said, it's perfectly likely she uses it as a method of demanding attention instead of any grief-related issues.", "My dad died 10 years ago. I was 22 and it was sudden. It was devastating, and I'm so grateful to my friends for getting me through the worst of it. I still occasionally have an \"I miss my daddy\" moment, or tear up watching a father-daughter dance, but I would never even dream about faulting others for having a living father. That's just ridiculous.  People have fathers. Also, fathers die. If something triggers a tear, I actually welcome it. It reminds me to not forget all the good times. This friend of yours sounds unhinged.\n\nNTA \n\nI don't even think your delivery was that bad. It needed to be impactful enough to get through to her. And if she chooses to stop being friends over this, doesn't sound like you're missing much. She'd be setting you free.", "I'm going with NTA but your delivery could have been much kinder. I understand getting frustrated after dealing with this for so long, but it might be more helpful to say something like \"I understand a lot of things can be triggering after what you went through. I'm concerned about you and I think a therapist could help you navigate these triggers better than I can, I don't have the capacity to do it because I'm not a professional\" and apologize for being harsh if you want to preserve the friendship.", "NAH\n\nYou have a valid point that it is unreasonable to continue to be that sensitive or step on egg shells over the loss of their father after 8 years.\n\nShe is allowed and entitled to her own grieving process. But should definitely not allow it to continue to affect her other relationships.\n\nDefinitely sounds like you need a break from her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Depression, bad mental health and mourning over a lost loved one is absolutely no excuse to treat those around you like rubbish. \n\nIf anything, it sounds like her loss has caused her true colours to surface. It happens a lot when people fake being nice to have friends around them and it's way more common than you think.

I lost my mom a year and a half ago, and while my grief is still raw and I am triggered by all sorts of things unexpectedly, I don't expect other people not to be able to share their feelings, and I do my best to figure out whether media I consume will be too traumatizing for me (but let's face it, a lot of times you can't predict what will be triggering). The fact that your friend is reacting like this suggests she would benefit from grief counseling or a grief support group. For me, the biggest help on my grief journey has been a friend I met who's going through something similar\u2013\u2013we have our own mini grief therapy sessions, and she and I get what each other are going through and are able to support and comfort each other in ways our other friends are not. This has helped me have healthier relationships with other people who have not experienced the kind of loss that she and I have.   \n\n\nThat said, I know that supporting your friend is \"getting exhausting\" in your words, but I bet her grief is even more exhausting, especially having lost a parent so young.
