At the time I did my best to try support her through it and be there for her. I think I mostly still do that now. \n\nHowever I believe that she has coped with it very badly. Not her fault I know. But it\u2019s getting to a point where it\u2019s unmanageable. \n\nWe can\u2019t watch any film where someone dies. If we do accidentally, she goes into a state of sadness for the rest of the day and won\u2019t speak to anyone. \n\nAnytime someone mentions their dad, in like a casual sense, she gets upset and calls us insensitive. Last year, she wanted to hangout with me and I told her I couldn\u2019t because it was Father\u2019s Day. She got upset about that.  \n\nEvery time someone\u2019s having a bad day and opens up about it, it can\u2019t compare to her bad day because at least our dad is still alive. \n\nI tried to be supportive but it\u2019s been getting exhausting. \n\nA couple of days ago we watched a film in which the main character has a dead dad. She got upset with me that I had let her watch that film. I told her that it was her responsibility if she didn\u2019t want to watch something to look it up beforehand. I then told her that her behaviour was getting exhausting and that I couldn\u2019t do this anymore.  If she didn\u2019t want to lose her friends then she\u2019d have to start working on herself. \n\nShe hasn\u2019t texted me since and I know she\u2019s really angry at me.

Perhaps weeks or months ago. Clearly she needs coping skills. Her avoiding dad situations is not healthy and is damaging to others.", "NTA, in my books you are a good friend. Friends should be able to tell the truth to each other, otherwise what's the point? Maybe you should reach out and ask if she wants help finding the right therapy/grief counselor for her. She doesn't have to do this by herself, but after 8 years, the path should be about moving forwards and not staying stuck in the past.", "NTA. After 8 years I would definitely be getting suspicions she's doing it for attention and drama rather than genuine grief. Why did she not just leave the film if it upset her so? Why does she have to bang on about how bad she has it every time someone else tries to vent? From what you have said, it's perfectly likely she uses it as a method of demanding attention instead of any grief-related issues.", "My dad died 10 years ago. I was 22 and it was sudden. It was devastating, and I'm so grateful to my friends for getting me through the worst of it. I still occasionally have an \"I miss my daddy\" moment, or tear up watching a father-daughter dance, but I would never even dream about faulting others for having a living father. That's just ridiculous.  People have fathers. Also, fathers die. If something triggers a tear, I actually welcome it. It reminds me to not forget all the good times. This friend of yours sounds unhinged.\n\nNTA \n\nI don't even think your delivery was that bad. It needed to be impactful enough to get through to her.

I understand getting frustrated after dealing with this for so long, but it might be more helpful to say something like \"I understand a lot of things can be triggering after what you went through. I'm concerned about you and I think a therapist could help you navigate these triggers better than I can, I don't have the capacity to do it because I'm not a professional\" and apologize for being harsh if you want to preserve the friendship.", "NAH\n\nYou have a valid point that it is unreasonable to continue to be that sensitive or step on egg shells over the loss of their father after 8 years.\n\nShe is allowed and entitled to her own grieving process.

Grief never really leaves us, but as time goes on, we have to learn how to live with that grief. 8 years is way too long to be this affected by his death this intensely. Of course, when memories come up or moments like being walked down the aisle will bring up some emotions. However, reacting so harshly to a character that happens to have a dead dad is unusual. With the constant avoidance of confronting these emotions of grief, she kinda stunted her emotional growth. \n\n\nI can say confidently that after my fathers death, I would get emotional at movies that referenced death or parental death.

I agree with a majority of your comment, but I do disagree that OP should make suggestions to her friend about how to grieve/\"honor\" her father. Sure, comments like that often come from a good place with the best intentions, but I doubt someone that is in a clear grief spiral would respond very well to someone else telling them what they think they should do to adjust/cope - especially if the comment is coming from a friend who (presumably) is not in the dead parents club. Losses that happen unexpectedly and/or earlier than what we perceive as \"normal\" often come hand-in-hand with a lifetime of missed events and milestones that we normally expect to share with that person. The reason for the death also plays a big role and can result in unresolved trauma. It's also very isolating if you do not have anyone in your life who can relate to losing a parent at a young, developmental age. However, the friend needs to learn how to cope - she also needs to be the one to take ownership of how to do that. It's a  tough lesson to learn. In the meantime, OP and the rest of their friends are fully within their right to make and maintain their own boundaries.\n\nAlthough the friend's feelings there are valid, she needs to accept that her feelings are her responsibility alone. It is completely unreasonable to expect everyone around you to be hyper-mindful of all of your triggers, even to avoid discussing their own fathers or monitoring if certain shows, movies, songs, etc will have any references to dead parents. True friendships do not involve walking on eggshells 24/7. It is okay for OP's friend to have certain emotional reactions to some content (that will likely happen here and there throughout her life), but not to take out her grief on others or blame them for \"causing\" it. It also sounds like the frequency that this is happening is very unhealthy. I hope she seeks out some professional guidance from a therapist who specializes in grief to address that.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree that OP's friend clearly needs to learn healthier ways of \"living with\" her grief. Losing a parent during adolescence is incredibly painful, but the responsibility is absolutely on her to figure out her own limits, learn how to communicate in a healthy manner about them (not to expect her friends to be her own content-filter for movies/shows/etc), and learn how to be equally as supportive to her friends for their own struggles without dragging her dead parent into the equation.", "It\u2019s like Vonnegut used to say, laughter is easier to mop up than tears.", "The Op's friend is a woman.

Every grieving person needs to talk it out, so things like this don't happen", "NTA\n\nMy Dad and I have tried, for years, to get my step-Mum to go to therapy for this very reason.\n\nHer father died in her late teens (she was very close to him and her mother, right up to her death, was emotional and verbally abusive towards my step-mother), and that was almost 4 decades ago, and she still grieves hard for him, and it not in a healthy.\n\nShe has nightmares about his death - her screams for him to come back have woken the whole house numerous times over the years.\nHolidays, particularly Christmas, because he passed in December, are always challenging (my Dad's birthday is also in December which she frequently forgets - I should mention she is on serious pain relief and medication because she is physically disabled, and the medication does impacts her memory - but will get upset with us if we don't give her a card or flowers threw out the month so she can grieve her father).\nShe talks about him all the time, which is fine, but it can sometimes be in a way that almost like he's still alive. \nMusic and some movies will make her start crying uncontrollably because they remind her of her father.\n\nDad and I (and my Dad's family because my step-mother has zero contact with her family) try to be supportive of her, and do try to take into account that she is in serious pain 24/7 and on heavy duty medication, but the slightest thing can set her off about her Dad, which can lead to her screaming abuse at us. Everytime we've tried suggesting grief counseling or therapy in general (her mother has caused a lot of emotional hurt and, again she's suffers from a pretty debilitating physically disability which she will have for the rest of her life), she explodes at us, saying we don't understand her grief or pain and so on.\n\nIt's a hard road to tread, but you are NTA to your friend for suggesting she go to therapy to help her process her father's passing.", "NTA. Death is difficult, we all handle it and grieve differently. But the expectation that the world stops is not a functioning or healthy mind set. Your friend needs to seek some mental health assistance. Hope that situation improves!", "NTA - the girl could really use some grief counselling.", "NTA but I will say that grief is difficult and different for everyone. She needs help.", "NTA", "NTA. I know of people who have lost close family members to them and they had really hard times with it. Heck last year I lost two aunts (one on December 2) a cousin, and a second cousin plus my stepdaughter lost her husband to be. Yes you grieve for a time but eventually you have to get on with your life. Anniversaries and special days are always going to be hard and there will always be reminders. But the ones who have left us would want us to go on.", "NTA. And I can speak to this. I was 16 when my dad got cancer, 18 when he died.\n\nI was sad for myself. And like folks said, grief is individual, but it never occurred to me that other people having the nerve to still have a dad was an offense to me. \n\nI had a friend who let me wander around weird at college, wearing my dad's Oxford shirts and awful green sweater for 3 months. I found out later she'd gone to the school's counselor to ask how she could support me, knowing I wouldn't want to go myself. \n\nAnd it eased. I missed him. I thought of him. I've railed that he never knew my husband and kids. That my mom had to be mom alone for my younger siblings. \n\nYour friend needs a hand. Her grief is imploding her life, and you're not equipped to handle that yourself.", "NTA, \n\nI also lost my dad at a young age and I am still struggling mentally at times with it. What helped me was going to therapy and having people who love me around during that time. \n\nI know people grieve differently but, being so upset and not getting help or talking to someone about it just harms her even further and makes the situation way worse than it already is. I know grief will always be there since you never get over losing someone close to you but you need something to distract yourself so you can live your life to the fullest.  I know grief will always be there since you never get over losing someone close to you but you need something to distract yourself so you can live your life to the fullest.", "Definitely NTA! I agree it is hard, but almost everyone has trauma and we cannot expect the world to stop turning because bad things are unfortunately bound to happen. My husband lost his twin brother when we started dating in high school. You can bet it was difficult and changed him for forever, however, he knows it\u2019s no one else\u2019s responsibility to heal or avoid his triggers but him. He would never expect others to never talk about their brothers or twins or expect the world to stop turning\u2026..", "In the show \"New Girl\", Jack Johnson's character's dad dies. In that episode, and maybe 1 or 2 after, he screams, \"DEAD DAD CARD\". That was within the weeks following. I know it's just a show, but you can only play that card for so long (read YEARS AFTER), to use that as an excuse to not get help with that trauma. I'm not trying to be AH about their feelings, but some counseling helps.", "Oh honey, not your own parent using you as a therapist/social worker. Grief is hard, yes, but you should\u2019ve been allowed to be a kid.\n\nBig ups to you, I hope things are better now and that *you* have people to lean on and someone to talk to.", "> Jack Johnson's character\n\nI was really confused until I realized you meant Jake Johnson. I was like \"The banana pancakes guy is an actor now?!?\"", "LOL I knew it was a J name, sorry! \ud83d\ude14", "I agree. I have lost both my parents - dad 5 years ago and mom coming up on a year. I know everyone grieves differently but after 8 years and the world is supposed to pre-screen movies and have grief Olympics with her?
