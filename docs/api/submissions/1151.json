After lunch yesterday my grandmother said \"I'm so glad to hear you'll be moving back home to New England soon!\", and it turns out my dad told her that. It's not true at all, I have no plans on moving \"home\" anytime soon, and I've never actually lived here. My parents know that, and when I asked my mom later she said my dad told a white lie just to make his mom happy (she's 98). \n\nHonestly, I would have gone along with the lie and not really cared if my parents told me beforehand. But when I asked my dad about it later, he said it was probably a lie but also that he hoped I would actually move back to America and settle down and get married soon. That's when I lost it on him, saying/shouting that it was his fault that I would never settle down, seeing as how the only thing I knew was moving from place to place due to his job (mostly true), not being able to have long-term friendships or serious relationships (not really true), and that I hated having to move around all the time anyway (was true for a bit but now I love it), and that I never want to move back to America (not true). In reality, I'm not ruling out moving to America, settling down with someone, having kids, etc..., just that I don't know if I want to or not, and certainly not immediately. \n\nHe hasn't talked to me since. My mom actually doesn't seem bothered about any of what I said, saying that she's fine with me living my own life and doing whatever, but also said that I should keep up the lie to my grandmother, and apologize to my dad for talking to him that way and that he had meant well all along, both for me as well as doing good work for the UN. \n\nSo AITA for making my dad and possibly my grandmother upset for saying that I'm never going to settle down and move back to America and blaming my dad for it?", "created_utc": 1667560825, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylw9wz/aita_for_blaming_my_parents_on_not_settling_down/", "score": 9, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As humans, we\u2019re capable of having conflicting feelings. You can love the freedom of travel and loathe the logistics. You can be grateful you had such an interesting childhood while still being annoyed with your parents about moving you so often. \n\nIt sounds like things had built up for a while - maybe, when you\u2019re feeling ready, consider speaking calmly to your dad and talking through some of those feelings?", "NTA because the lie that was told was very specific. Even if you move back to America, it doesn't mean that you'd be going to New England or that you'd be doing it soon. It's a ridiculous thing to say", "YTA. I understand you were frustrated, and your dad shouldn\u2019t have lied to your grandmother, but this was a huge overreaction. Also, the settling down thing? Did your parents not consistently prove to you your entire life that having a family doesn\u2019t mean staying in one place? You could\u2019ve said that. You could\u2019ve said \u201cI still really enjoy travel and I\u2019m grateful I got to do it so much and continue to, maybe I\u2019ll meet someone and start a family, but I may never want to stay in one place. You guys taught me there is more than one way to have a family, so for now, I\u2019m not looking for anything but if it comes along I\u2019ll let you guys know.\u201d It would\u2019ve been a reasonable middle ground, had the benefit of being true, and wasn\u2019t a random tirade for no reason.", "YTA and a baby for your age. My mother was an alcoholic, drug-addicted gypsy. I have gone to 11 different schools and left home at 16 to try for my own \"normal\" life. I am happy and successful in so many ways. Your parents did what they thought was best for many reasons. Suck it up Buttercup, and go have a good life in spite of your upbringing. Sheez, baby-crier if I have ever heard one. At your age, you and only you are responsible for how your life goes. Now go apologise and stop blaming.", "YTA \nYou don\u2019t have to move around just because they did?\nJust like someone born into a small town has to stay there and not search for bigger and better things. \n\nDo you blame other people for everything or nah?", "YTA, why do you go out of your way to hurt your parent using lies if it was really what you think that would be another story.", "We learn by example. The example set forth by your parents was moving frequently, and internationally, during much of your childhood. Your dad expecting you to \u201csettle down\u201d anywhere is definitely hypocritical. \n\nBut, YTA for how you handled this situation.", "ESH. He should have told you about the white lie to your gma before he said it. It\u2019s also a little lame for him to actually say out loud his preference for you to move back, but that\u2019s not a terrible sin. He moved all around just like you, and you\u2019re probably one of his only constant pillars in life. If you couldn\u2019t make friends then he certainly couldn\u2019t because he was working and moving all the time. You may be one of his best friends and you\u2019re not around anymore. \n\nYour outburst was over the top after he said it, and it leads me to believe there are more issues under the surface with your dad. You got so angry that you said untrue things to him, apparently just to hurt him. That\u2019s not cool.", "Yes and No? Like totally understandable as to why you'd feel this way and you did bring up some totally fair points, but at the same time there was no reason to bring up stuff that's not necessarily true (or at least not anymore). I don't think you owe your dad an apology per say, but you do gotta open up about all this and be honest", "YTA. You need to grow up and stop blaming your dad for your current life choices. Seek therapy.", "I mean, you say yourself a lot of what you blamed him for isn't true or isn't even a problem. Get it together and apologize to the man.", "Damn. Your mom is one reasonable lady. You should listen to her. \n\nIt feels like you have a lot of bottled up feeling for you dad that went unsaid here in your post and just wanted to hurt him in that phone call. \n\nYTA on this one.", "He expresses a desire for his kid to move close to him so he could spend more time with you. You blew up on him on everything you've ever resented about their life choices.\n\nSome of it may have been true, but you could have said that in a much much better way. YTA.", "So mild YTA. You told your dad a bunch of stuff that you admit wasn't true. You blame your parents for a lifestyle that you now seem to enjoy but still harbor anger about not liking it years ago when you were a child. Most parents do their best, are they gonna screw up, sure they are, mine did and I'm sure I have as well. I don't screw up on purpose and likely neither did they. At 31 you have likely experienced some or much of how the world works, it isn't fair or orderly, it is chaotic and messy and most of us, parents included, are just trying to make it through each day keeping ourselves and those we care about safe.", "YTA,\n\nlet me get it right, yes your dad was an ass for lying and not telling you,\n\nbut then you blame something, you can do, on him and blame aspects of your childhood on him witch, your words, aren't exactly true,\n\nenglish is not my first but that's the picture I'm getting", "Your dad told a lie to your 98 yr old grandma to keep her happy, understandable, but he should have thought to loop you in.. \n\nYou had a major blow up on him accusing him of responsibility for things you admit are not true or only partially true. I'm not even sure where that came from, but it does put you in the AH category here. You are lacking a bit in maturity here, at least at that moment, and need to figure out what this big anger response was even about, and talk it out while you on on the same continent.", "ESH\n\nYou're 31. Your grandmother is 98. Your father should have given you a heads-up that he was telling her a \"white lie\" and to just go with it. Then it would have been you eye-rolling but not losing your sh\\*\\* like you did here.\n\nHave you been in therapy ever? Because it seems like you have a lot to work through, and a lot of anger that just exploded over something as small as telling an extremely elderly person something that will make them happy, and which they will likely not be around (or cognizant) to have to see it through.\n\nYou should be more mature at 31 than to yell at your relatives and say \"I am NEVER GOING TO DO\" whatever it is.

I can understand why you blew up, but your reaction was out of proportion, unless there\u2019s additional background you\u2019re not telling. I can also understand why your dad told a white lie to his 98yo mother, but he should have looped you in. Apologize to your dad for blowing up then ask him to loop you in to these sorts of things in the future. Tell your grandma you have been considering moving back but no firm plans have been made. And then go get therapy to deal with your resentments. That last line isn\u2019t meant to be snarky. Therapy is a great resource and everybody has stuff they could use a neutral party to help deal with.", "Esh- don't lie to your grandmother. And don't lie to your parents.
