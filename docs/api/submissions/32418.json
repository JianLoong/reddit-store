This will be the first time my partner and I are living in our dream home together, and we're also gearing up for the exciting journey of starting a family. We've been planning this for years and want to create a positive environment for our future child.I love my sister, but I don't want her living with us. She claims it's unfair and rude, and she hasn't spoken to me in weeks. My (60f) believes I'm being cruel, but my husband and I see it differently.My sister unfortunately doesn't have a place to stay, but I believe she's old enough to figure it out herself.

In Spain she would be able to sue your parents and you.

You should\u2019ve been working towards that anyway or a home to start a family in, at least, by this age. I think I would argue that 22 is a more crucial time in life.

The fact that you\u2019re ok with her being homeless is crazy to me, you didn\u2019t buy the house so she\u2019s entitled to stay. She grew up in that house too.", "YTA. I would be so mad if my sibling got the house because of stupid reasons such as I am the oldest.", "YTA.", "YTA. Your parents gifted you a house that your sister was living in, and now she's evicted with no grace period? Your comments make you sound really cold too. Give your sister a grace period to find a place of her own at least.", "YTA and it sounds like your parents created you this way. Your sister may very well have a condition that affects her ability to function but if you really cared about her (and evidence here suggests you don't) you would at least offer her a place to stay if she is in treatment and doing the work treatment requires. At the very least you could create a formal lease and sublet a room for a period of time that allows for transition.\n\nThe fact your parents have moved was something that was likely in the works for a while and if your sister was aware of these plans then she has some culpability in not finding a place to stay but with what you have said her ability to interact with the world might be severely compromised. But naturally this is all very terribly inconvenient for you and that is what is really important here. Everyone here sounds like an asshole and you most of all. Giving off real \"but it's miiiiiiiiiiiinnnne\" vibes. Furthermore depending on your parents for a house is lazy and entitled, if you had a shred of decency you'd try to find a way to be supportive in this mess but your clear sense of un-deserved and un-earned self-importance likely prevents that.

Of course YTA, how can you not see that at all? \n\nSo your sister has been living with her parents, probably trying to save money, and is considerably younger than you and also not married \\[so doesn't have the added bonus of two incomes\\]. She has a disability that will make it hard for her ultimately in life in general. You are a major AH. \n\nShe asked for a grace period simply to get herself together so she can move out on her own, which is a completely REASONABLE and MATURE thing for her to do, yet you can't even give her that?

You\u2019ve been told your entire life that you\u2019re being given the house and there\u2019s no current plan (that you know of) for your sister to inherit anything. Given the 14 year age gap, I\u2019m guessing you were the child your parents wanted and your sister was an \u201coops\u201d baby.

I, too,  find it suffocating.\n\nYour parents are first world AHS. They treat your sister like she doesn't mean or count as much as you do. Not only second in birth, but apparently the bottom in all their choices. I wouldn't talk to them again. Or you who are an active part of their unfair treatment.

Quick question though, is your sister abusive in any way and that's why you are being so apathetic? Otherwise, I don't quite get it and it looks like you are the golden child. I also don't think you are doing yourself any favors by responding in 5 words or less without adding any elaboration. Might want to add details as to why you are behaving like this in your post or in comments. \n\nAs it stands now, your sister is an AH because she has an opportunity to move to FL with your parents and is actively choosing not to. She is not going to be homeless like some other redditors are saying. Your parents are AHs because they still have a relatively young daughter and should be still caring for her as she moves into new adulthood and not making your sister your issue. You are an AH because while it's not your problem, you should be working towards a solution with your parents to make this transition easier for all involved parties instead of ousting your sister entirely. While I don't think you are an AH for getting gifted the house since it wasn't your decision, you should have a certain amount of grace and compassion on the transition if there aren't any other factors that are causing this disturbance.", "Nta - your parents didn't want to make this decision, so they left it up to you.

That\u2019s their right. They could have asked you to pay for it. They didn\u2019t. That\u2019s their right. Your parents are offering your sister a home in their new house but she is choosing not to move. She\u2019s an adult who is making decision and has to live with the consequences of that decision.

This house holds a lot of sentimental value for me, as I've spent my entire life here. My younger sister (22f) currently lives with our parents, but she has flat out refused to join them in Florida and wants to stay in our hometown.  \nHere's where the issue arises: she asked to stay with my husband and me, and I said no. This will be the first time my partner and I are living in our dream home together, and we're also gearing up for the exciting journey of starting a family. We've been planning this for years and want to create a positive environment for our future child.  \nI love my sister, but I don't want her living with us. She claims it's unfair and rude, and she hasn't spoken to me in weeks. My mother-in-law (60f) believes I'm being cruel, but my husband and I see it differently.  \nMy sister unfortunately doesn't have a place to stay, but I believe she's old enough to figure it out herself. AITA for not allowing her to stay with us during this crucial time in our lives?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Is she on SSI for her bipolar?\n\nIf you\u2019re being gifted a house and have to make no payments on it, you should get your sister an apartment and pay for the first year of rent to get her situated .", "Bipolar is TA.  Nobody chose this for your sister.\n\nIt's left everyone not really knowing what to do next, without feeling selfish. Because every one of you wants to live their life with LESS stress.  \n\n\nYour sister:  still very young to have anything figured out-- it's not her fault but she does have to understand that her life with bipolar will never be easy.  And she needs a realistic living situation: 1) Free (?) with you, but you don't want her, 2) free with your parents, for now, but she does not want that in FL (and perhaps they knew she would not want to go), 3) find a place/room to rent (you did not mention a job/income situation for her).\n\n\nYou (and husband): our 'gift home' our rules. Lucky you (UNLESS you are purchasing/renting).  IF it's truly a gifted home, you are the luckiest.\n\nParents:  wanting to live their life, nearing/in retirement, and now having to worry about what each or their daughters will do, knowing that this would be a huge predicament -- a gift and a curse.\n\nI think the best solution would have been for your parents to sell the home and gift both you and your sister some/or all the (proceeds) between themselves and their daughters.

Also \"she doesn't have a place to say, but she's old enough to figure it out\" is extremely rude. It's like you're talking about a stranger, not family. Very rude.", "YTA. Your parents too. Your parents are giving you the house and you are throwing your sister out. You should be buying g your sister out of her portion of the house. Of course you\u2019d never do that.

You should take some mental health classes before having a child also, Bipolar disorder is hereditary as are loads of other things.

And now you can pass it on to your kids (probably). \n\nIt's not your desire to start a family or individuate that makes you an asshole, right? It's the fact that you were raised in a family where the oldest child is \"burdened\" by a sick younger sibling and your parents didn't do enough to foster compassion in you or support your sister the way she needed earlier in her teens. This is just a natural evolution of shitty family dynamics. Everyone loses.  \n\nIt's okay though. It's not your fault. Your family conditioned you to play responsible big sister too much for too long and now you're an ass to your sister because she's young and sick and you resent her. \n\nYes you are an asshole but it's not your fault that you learned to be one.", "YTA\nAnd a big one\n\nAbsolutely selfish if you ask me\nAll you think is about yourself nobody else\n\nYou're just a jerk", "YTA you are being given the house. She is being gifted homelessness. Of course YTA and your parents. You all sound entitled and selfish I hope your sister gets away from you all and lives well", "YTA, you get a free house and your sister can\u2019t stay where she already lives.", "YTA so much that I'm wondering if this is rage bait. \n\nYou're dancing around the fact that you are essentially kicking her out, not just \"not letting her move in.\" Your comments also say that even your mom says you're being cruel. The mom that is GIVING you a house. \n\nI get the impression that you think her having bipolar disorder makes a better case for you, but its quite the opposite. It just makes this much more cruel. Your mom is right. \n\nAnd even without her disability, she is quite young, especially given current economic conditions. And given her no grace period? Its extremely difficult to find housing, even in the best of circumstances. \n\nBut I'm wondering if you're already quite aware that times are very tough financially, because you seem eager to accept a free house without even offering your parents anything in return. Without even considering your parents wishes about your sister. Do you have any money either? \n\nDo better.", "YTA.  I really hope your karma is public and messy.", "YTA.\n\nAlso since you're inheriting the house and not purchasing it and because your sister is already living there, she most likely has tenants rights. You probably can't legally kick her out", "YTA and so are your parents. Giving your sister a small grace period to get a place of her own would be better than just throwing her out.

You could draw up a lease that she must sign, laying out the rules of staying and what time frame she needs to have her place. \n\nIs she being properly treated for her BPD?? \n\n\nYour parents are bigger assholes for just giving you the house and nothing to your sister of the same value.

Even if the house had been sold to OP for a fair price, it would have not been an issue, as it is their property. But in Spain all the children have rights to a specific part of the inheritance of their parents, even if there is no will, even if the relationship is no good. It is called \"la leg\u00edtima\". In properties, all the children have to be given that part of the inherited property, or something of equal value of their parents' assets, even if one of the children is given a higher share of said property. In this case, if this was in Spain, at least a 33% of the house would have gone to the sister in the even of the parents's death (1/3 of the parent's property). As many parents would try to circumvent this norm by gifting properties to one child while they were alive, as the law was only enforced after their death, gifting a whole house without compensation would have been seen as a suspicious movement by the parents, called \"alzamiento de bienes\", that harmed the future gain of OP's sister, so she will have grounds for a lawsuit, as they can be seen as cheating the law to favour one child over the other. Legally, all the red alerts will sound like crazy in the same moment they see a person trying to gift one of the children their property in full having other kids. \n\nIn Spain it is very difficult to disown a child and there are very solid laws to avoid things like Op describes here, also to protect descendants from being harmed by acts like this or to avoid the properties as a way to presure the children into doing the parent's bidding. But in compensation we also have laws that force the descendants to take care of the parents if they are in a situation of need, so all the parts are protected. But it is really difficult to cheat this inheritance laws here. In fact, even if you renounce to your part of your parents' inheritance before their death, you have to follow a recognized legal process. For example, my dad used to tell me the story of his grandparents by his mother's side. They were a ton of brothers and sisters, and some brothers didn't want to take care of their parents in their old age. They promised they will forfeit their part of the inheritance if the other brothers/sisters took care of their common parents in their place. They agreed, but they didn't do the process correctly, so when my great-grandparents' died, they were able to claim their part of the inheritance, despite everything.", "I know that's what I was saying.", "Because she pretty clearly hates her sister.", "What do you want to bet OP is one of those women who thinks because she has a husband, that she's entitled to her parents' home?", "22 and disabled.

Thank you so much for this information.", "Also, there is another variable here. Here there is a legal duty to care for your parents if something happens, and that can go against all the children equally.

This means she doesn't need to live with you and fixes the issue of her not wanting to go to Florida with your parents.\n\nIf your parents can afford to give you this house, and buy (or just move) to one down in Florida then it sounds like they have plenty of money and can afford to at least subsidise your sister in an apartment.  Giving her some autonomy and the expectation that she sort herself out and make it on her own over time will probably help her mental health... but she needs to be medicated if her bipolar is out of control.

A mood stabiliser may make all the difference.\n\nIf you were moving into a different house than your childhood home that is currently housing your sister, I would give a different judgement.  \n\nBut your sister needs to take some responsibility for herself and that's likely going to need to start with sorting out her mental health.

The very few cases that the judge rules that a parent can completely disinherit a child have even made the news, they are so rare. You have to argue why. For example, a very rich man recently died in Spain. He disinherit in his last will his first five children. The children are contesting it because it is illegal unless very specific causes, like mistreatment of the parent by the children, or fault in the duty to care for the parents. If the named heirs can't demostrate in a trial that the deceased was right, those five children can't be deprived of their \"legitima\" (the obligatory part for the children).", "And not just in Spain, same laws apply in Finland as most likely in several other countries as well.

Every state has different laws with this. If you own your home & die, your children get your ownership of the property even if a spouse survives. \n\nSo if my spouse dies for example, I\u2019ll own 1/2 and the other 1/2 will be split owned between our kids: 50%, 25%, 25%. As minor children the surviving spouse still has the ability to sell it but technically that portion of the profit belongs to the kids.", "Not completely, no. It has to be divided with the children, and if it is an inheritance, it can't be given to a spouse to protect the children's rights. If it is a normal property, usually the wife/husband inherit 50% of the property, and the other 50% is divided between said wife and the children. For example, if someone has one child, the spouse would inherit 50% + 25% and the child 25%. If that person remarries and dies, they have the same right to their property, and the same percentages would be applicable again, but the children can't be completely deprived of the legitimate part of their parent's properties, which at the bare minimum 1/3 of each property and of the liquid assets. Also, if the property is an inheritance that is passed to blood family, the spouse doesn't get anything. But there is a legal figure called \"usufructo\", in which you can left said in your last will that your spouse have the right to reside in a property and not be kicked out of it while he/she lives, as the property was maintained with shared money during the duration of the marriage. But it will not be the property of the widow, and he/she could never make big decisions or sell it without the legal owners' permission. For example, my mom owns her family's house, passed down generation to generation since my great-grandparents, in other city. As it was an inheritance, it was solely property of my grandma, no shared by my grandpa. When she died, pretty young, the house passed down to my mom and aunt, 50% each, but she established in the last will that her husband had the right to live and use that house as long as he lived, although the property was my aunt's and my mom's legally. They couldn't legally evict him or sell the house with him in it, if it was his primary residence. When he died, my mom bought my aunt's part. Now, when she dies (I hope in many, many years), my dad will have the use of that house, but the property will be exclusively of my sister and me. If he remarries, his new wife will have no right to that house when he dies.", "Sure but the wills have to follow the law.

She could have said: \"Ok, I know it is unfair for her, but I really want this for me and my family, so I will make sure she will receive everything that is left when they die to try to even out, or I will take care of my parents to compensate for it if necessary\".

I am going to give her a grace period (she says in the comments that she is not giving her one, despite being the sister's home) so she can find somewhere else with my help\".

Your legitimate heirs in Spain are your children, or, if you don't have them, your parents. If you have neither, you can leave your assets to whoever you want. But for example, my sister has a kid, so it is very difficult for her to desinherit him, even if she wanted, but I don't, so I wouldn't be able to disinherit my parents if I die before them, either. These laws are made to protect all the direct ascendants and descendants of the family, and if you are legally liable of things, you get to be economically protected, too, and no part can be left out if all of them are liable if something wrong happens.", "lol I literally hate the US and am trying to move for many of the things you stated.
