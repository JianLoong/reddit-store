She wants to be realistic about her meager budget and you don't want to get useless junk just to get something. \n\nMaybe try asking for something she could do for you instead of but buy you.

Maybe you can find a middle ground where she can stick to her budget and you still receive something you'll like.", "NTA i'm the same. i have a deal with friends that unless it is something meaningful then we don't. If it is family give me a dollar amount and i will tell you what to contribute to.", "NTA. I\u2019ve had the same problem. Either getting crappy cheap knickknacks that I would Never have any use for or something that was so far out of my taste or age range it wasn\u2019t even funny. \n\nI tried for Years to get these people to understand that I make a wishlist to help both them as givers find something I\u2019d actually be happy to receive and me to not have to lie and say thanks while thinking about if I knew anyone who could use the crap I was given or if there For Once was a receipt.

You can be honest and still be tactful.\n\nYou didn't have to tell her you've thrown away her dollar store gifts before. You could have simply said: Money's tight so let's skip gift giving this year. Maybe do a free activity together or something else.", "YTA.  I get what you were trying to say, because I've never really liked small little dust-grabbers myself.  But you basically told your sister that her gift giving skills are shit and you'll only be happy if she buys you a thing from your list.  If you'd said something like \"hey, if you're broke from vacation, don't worry about presents for me at all.  I don't need anything and I don't want you to feel like you have to spend money on me\" it probably would have gone over much better", "NTA", "I guess I\u2019m in the minority here when I say NTA? Firstly, I\u2019m 30 and we still write Christmas lists - I have a big family and we hate the idea of wasting money on presents the recipient doesn\u2019t actually want. We\u2019re old enough now that we\u2019ve all accumulated a lot of \u201cstuff\u201d and don\u2019t really want to add to it. \n\nMy sister has also been abroad the last 2 years. We\u2019ve just said, for Christmas and Birthdays, to not bother buying anything. If we see something we like, we buy it for ourselves and say \u201cthanks for my present\u201d the next time we speak. \n\nIf you\u2019ve got some inexpensive items on the list (maybe even go below $5?) then I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s unreasonable or ungrateful.", "I'm not going to say YTA because of the family practice of making and sharing lists, but basic etiquette says to show gratitude for any gift, then dispense with it as you see fit later. Just act grateful and let her enjoy the act of giving. What you do with the dust-catchers after the fact is your business. So, soft YTA.", "YTA, be grateful already wtf is wrong with you. We\u2019ve all had family members give wasteful gifts or ugly clothes. Say thank you and go about your life.", "YTA, I'm someone who hates clutter, the things you mentioned are small,  surely you can keep them in a box hidden away and appreciate that your sister thought of you.", "YTA. You're telling her that her gifts are not good enough for you. You say that you appreciate her effort, all while actually not appreciating it. \n\nI have a family member that didn't have a lot of money. On Christmas last year, they got me something I already had. I showed excitement because even though I didn't need it, they got it for me when they didn't have much to give to start with. I would have appreciated something for $1 if that's what they had got me. \n\nThat is appreciation. \"Don't get me anything if it's not something I want\" is not a nice way to be.", "YTA.\n\nYou're a grown woman. Why on earth are you making Christmas gift lists for yourself?", "YTA. So even when she is broke she is thoughtful enough to spend what little she doesn't have to get gifts for people she cares about. \n\nEven if you end up getting rid of them eventually, the right thing to do is to be grateful she cares enough to do it in the first place, thank her for her effort and move on.\n\nIt doesn't hurt you to be kind about it, and it doesn't hurt you to get a couple things that ultimately you aren't going to keep.", "YTA", "YTA. Why can\u2019t you simply be grateful for the thought?", "NTA I too dislike not usable presents (but I can\u2019t throw them away, too ecoguilty, I try to rehome them) especially if they are very cheap and will only end unused. \nYou maybe could have been nice about the way you said it, although I don\u2019t know if there is a better way", "NTA. You're not being an AH. My family and I do the same thing. Theres nothing wrong with you being honest with your sister. I suspect that her reaction is more to do with her feeling bad that she cant afford more and took it out on you. You're not responsible for her taking what you said so personally.", "YTA\n\nYou could have said this many other ways. For example, why don't you just suggest she buys you a book? A book is cheap, fun to read...etc.\n\nSurely there are other cheap ideas (T-shirt, socks with Santa design..). But don't send her to your wishlist, that's rude and offensive. Maybe you listed there expensive stuff too.", "YAH.  \nWho's your age with a Christmas list??", "ESH.  I don't understand why making a Christmas list as an adult is bad.  It is a good way to put down little inexpensive items that you would like.   Family members shouldn't have to read your mind to know what you want.  You suck for not being grateful.  Just appreciate that she's thinking of you.   Putting down shampoo/conditioner or bath bombs or something small and cheap would be a good gift idea.", "NTA as there are affordable items in the list. A gift is not meant to be an obligation, but as lists seem to be a tradition in your family and the price is reasonable I don't see why she can't choose from there.", "Can\u2019t somebody think about the planet?!", "The cheapest thing on my list is $8. I could probably add some cheaper household items though, thats a good point!", "I guess my opinion going into it was its shittier to secretly throw away or otherwise dispose of a gift than it is to ask the person not to get anything in the first place. That way, shes not spending money on something that will just go in the trash", "I have boxes of this kind of clutter, and all it means is I have to now hold on to it until I can reasonably dispose of a well-meaning \u201cthought\u201d.\nI hate them. I have that it shows that the giver is gifting out of obligation and not actually thinking of me", "The older we get and the more we can just buy for ourselves when we want it, Xmas lists are great for friends and family who either don't know what we already have or don't know us well enough to know what we'd like.", "We all make and exchange Christmas lists. All of my siblings, my mother and my grandmother. Generally if I forget, then I'm prodded with \"i need your list!\" messages", "Probably because she keeps getting shitty gifts like the ones described haha", "Not sure why we\u2019re getting downvoted. This is a normal take. Xmas lists in general are ridiculous to me and take the magic out of gift giving\u2026..", "I guess i just dont feel like being grateful for the thought and not wanting my sister to waste money on junk i dont want are mutually exclusive.", "My list has several items under $15 on it and a few under $10 as well. I didnt send her a lost specifically, everyone in my family makes/exchanges lists", "I think sometimes people put their \u2018dream items\u2019 on lists (not like a Caribbean cruise or anything, but not cheap stuff either!). Not saying you went all out with your list - but a range of prices would be good, I think. But $8 should be very very ok, I would have thought?!", "Then you probably didn\u2019t need to warn her that if she can\u2019t afford something off your list, don\u2019t bother.", "I agree about adding cheaper practical items to your list to help her out and they would make nice extra presents that people may want to buy you.  Personally, I find using gifted kitchen utensils or whatever gives a lovely little connection to the person who gifted them.\n\nBut NTA I too hate useless knickknacks that clutter up the place but can't be thrown out because they were presents.   You were just telling your sister what you don't like.  Perhaps if you'd told her years ago, she would have handled it better.  You've now dumped on years of her gifts to you, so maybe a soft YTA.", "How about putting something she can make from the kitchen on the list so it\u2019s not expensive, she feels like she\u2019s put something personal into making it and you can eat it hence not cluttering anything up. \n\nYTA for not having inexpensive/creative options on this sacred list", "This is ridiculous, you\u2019re adults. Your GRANDMA has a Christmas wish list?!?!", "\u201cI guess I just don\u2019t feel like being grateful for the thought\u201d\u2026..\n\nThere ya go\u2026.AH\n\nHer gifts may be cheap but to be grateful costs you nothing and makes someone YOUR SISTER feel good around the holidays. This is why YTA.  Put your annoyance and minimalist lifestyle aside for an hour and just say THANK YOU", "U might want to add that to the main post. Some People are misunderstanding that you are asking for expensive things and passing judgement off of that.", "OP said the cheapest thing on the list is $8. How is that not inexpensive?", "I guess that as a family we collectively agree that if we're going to spend money on things, we want it to be things that the other person wants. Not buying stuff just because. My grandma usually just asks for gift cards to lowes or restaurants \ud83d\ude0b", "Why is it ridiculous if it\u2019s their family tradition. Just because you don\u2019t understand it doesn\u2019t mean you should look down on it.", "Lol i wasn't saying \"i dont feel like being grateful for the thought\" i was saying \"i dont think that being grateful for the thought and not wanting my sister to waste money are mutually exclusive\"", "You make a good point but a grandma making a Xmas wishlist is ridiculous in my mind and no one is going to change my perspective.", "+1", "Thank you friend!"]}
