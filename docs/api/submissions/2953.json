That's fine, i dont give two fucks about not getting a gift. Ive spent several holidays abroad where, obviously, i didnt give or receive gifts on holidays or birthdays.\nHistorically, when my sister has been pretty broke, she will buy little gifts for people from the dollar store. Usually, the gifts are useless junk that i dont want/need/have a use for. For example, one year she got me these sparkley animal trading cards, little action figure thingys, a little hispanic lego man with a sombrero (her and my other older sister are half Mexican and find little things like this to be charming) and this unicorn drinking cup. All of those items, except the cup which i still use, kind of sat around in boxes until an acceptable amount of time passed and they got thrown out during a deep clean. I am not a person who likes stuff that just sits around my house with no purpose. Ill hang cool art, but thats mostly it. I would say my sister has given me gifts like this 4 or 5 times in the past.\n\nAnyway, i told my sister that if she is unable to get something cheap off my provided Christmas gift list, then I don't want anything at all. She asked me why and i told her that i appreciate the effort she makes to give gifts, even when she doesnt have a lot of money, but im not the type of person who likes \"cute little things\" that serve no purpose and they would likely get thrown away eventually so it's better for her to not waste the money. She said i was being \"a shitty asshole\" and to get over myself.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: Everyone in my family makes Christmas list. All of my adult siblings, my mother, my grandmother, etc. Also, the list i made has several items on it under $10.\n\nETA 2: The way a lot of you look at gift giving is really strange to me. You give gifts to do something kind for the person you're giving them to right? If thats the case, then you should be willing to consider (to a certain degree) what that person does or, in my case, doesnt want. If you are buying gifts for Someone with an attitude of \"idc what you do/dont want im going to buy you what i buy you and god dammit you better be grateful because i didnt have to buy you anything at all\", then arent you really only gift giving to make yourself feel good or to fulfill a societal/familial pressuse that you feel obligated to fulfill?\n\nThere are a million different scenarios in which someone does something to be kind or helpful, but the reality is, what they're doing is making your life more difficult or inconvenient. One should be able to communicate the idea of \"hey, i can see you are doing this with the intention of being kind or helpful. Thank you, i appreciate that. However, it's actually making my life more inconvenient for X reason. So could you please stop?\"", "created_utc": 1669123231, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1tfo2/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_if_shes_not_going/", "score": 400, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I mean huge!! And she isn't rich or well off in any way. These are things she sees or even hunts for & decides to buy herself even though she asks what we all want & we tell her. Nothing we tell her is expensive. We've even told her we're adults with our own kids so we don't need anything.  But she buys anyway so we figure if we tell her what we want, itll make it easier on her. That's better than her buying a ton of random stuff. Nope, she still buys bags full of random stuff for everyone which many times includes things we already have. There is nothing I can do to get through her head to save her money & buy 1 gift from the list...no more than that! We end up with a ton of stuff we already have or don't need/won't use. She buys stuff from dollar stores & more expensive items. When we open everything, you can see the half smiles on everyone's face because it's awkward. Like we're all thinking \"thanks, but what are we going to do with this?!\". I can't do anything to convince her to save herself money, time, & grief trying to get all these gifts & just get 1 thing off a list!", "INFO: do you have things on your list that would fit into the dollar store price range? If so, I think your request is reasonable, but if not, then it kind of comes across as \u201cI don\u2019t any a gift if it\u2019s too cheap even though you\u2019ve warned me you\u2019re strapped for cash \u201c, which is kind of rude", "NTA - I always prefer to give people stuff they request because it means I'm not wasting my money on something they won't use or like and I won't be the cause of any disappointment.\n\nFeel free to give away whatever she gives you to someone who may enjoy it.  This way it won't be a total waste and go in the garbage.", "NTA. I tell people every year that no one needs to get me anything, who needs more useless stuff? Unfortunately the best I have been able to do is get my generation (siblings and SOs) to switch to drawing names so we're only responsible for giving/recieving one from that age bracket. It, in no way, has stopped the yearly clothing gift from mom of something I would never wear (despite having the conversation every year), but I also don't have a box of Dollar Tree crap rotting away either so I'll take the small win.\n\n\nI personally feel that getting gifts is more stressful than giving gifts... Faking positive reactions to gifts you don't want/can't fathom why anyone who knows you would buy that for you detracts from holidays. Just spend time with me, time is gift enough.", "NTA, but it sounds like something may have gotten lost in translation.\n\nI think you're saying, if none of the gifts on your list fit your sister's price range, then no worries, sister can skip buying something else that you don't really appreciate.\n\nBut if your sister heard, \"If it's not on my list, don't bother,\" I can see her reading that as, \"If you're not together enough to buy something I want, I want nothing to do with you\"\u2014henxe the AH statement.", "NTA, \nI did this! I cant stand it when people spend money on me and I don\u2019t use it! I even went as far as to make a spreadsheet with different price points so that you could get me anything within a budget and it would be something I needed.", "I was going to say YTA when you said your family has Christmas wish lists. Yours had several items under $10. Should have led with that. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. I positively hate how our society has made it so that it's mandatory to buy shit instead of not buying anything. I mean it is literal wasted money. One way around this is to tell people : I understand you don't have money/don't want to spend much so please make a donation in my name to a rescue/non profit of your choice, as every coin helps.", "YTA. Having birthday and Christmas lists at this age and beyond is not only childish but entitled and self absorbed. Sometimes you get some shit you don\u2019t like. If it isn\u2019t out of malice or causing any harm have the grace to say thanks and donate to later or get rid of it. A Christmas wish list at 26, JFC", "NTA.", "NTA. She is wasting her money giving you junk you don\u2019t want, and then you are inconvenienced having to store it and eventually dispose of it.", "OP, I am you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA my MIL did that too but 100s of dollars worth of things that went in the trash or donated, regifted, etc., sooner than later. we asked her to stop with gifts, we'd rather just spend time with her. same goes for my sister, i told her to stop with the mugs already!! id rather nothing than for anyone to spend money on junk, just spend time together and nix the gifts. we all stopped with gifts, it's been great", "NTA.  I also hate mindless gifts that are just junk.  My ex used to do this.  Despite knowing me very well and my various interests, she'd buy me junk that made no sense.  \n\nI see no reason why anyone would have a problem with what you told your sister.  You're not being rude or insensitive, just honest.", "Am I the only one who stopped reading after the cute little Lego man in a Sombrero? I want that, and we don't even celebrate Christmas.", "NTA\n\nI get it. \n\nWe also make Christmas wishlists in my family. We make the list as big as possible to presents are still a surprise, and we make sure to add items to it that all sorts of different prices, including $10 ish", "YTA.  A wish list is not an order form that others are obligated to fill for you.  It exists so that they will have an idea of what you would like, in case they can't come up with something on their own.  If you receive something you don't like, just thank the giver then donate it.  \n\nYou were incredibly rude.", "NTA\n\nSounds like, and wasteful consumerism at best, and a thoughtless gift giving at worst. \n  What's the point of something that doesn't get used, besides maybe gifting to someone else who'd enjoy it or worse it goes in the bin. \n\nYour sister needs to get over her mentality that she is being magnanimous,  and letting her know that you do appreciate her thoughts, but don't want her to buy something that you have no real need for, may be a nicer way to word it.  Sounds like you may have wounded her pride a bit, and that's hard when someone doesn't have a lot to spend,  but still tries to do something nice. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I hate giving gifts for the sake of giving gifts. It's wasteful - moneywise and considering the environment. So I completely agree with you and it sounds like you told her in a nice way.", "YTA. Honestly, as wonderful as it is for people to get things off the list I wouldn't expect it from ever person. I would be extra appreciative if they did though. Just throw her stuff in a box of things to give away or throw it away secretly if you don't want it. Even expensive gifts aren't always hitting the spot for everyone, and they get rid of them. One dollar store item isn't a huge burden. \n\nYou could've said \"I do prefer the cheaper items on my list, but love whatever it is since you always are thoughtful about it.\" \n The way you said it was a bit like an asshole. Wishing it was from the list isn't the asshole behavior. They ultimatum kind of was though.", "YTA\n\nWhen you've reached the point of only accepting preselected gifts, it's time to let go of the farce of gift exchange and tell everyone youd prefer not to exchange gifts at all.\n\nYou are not entitled to a gift.  If you don't want a token gift,  just say so and save her the time and money.   It sounds like what you'd prefer is to pick your own gift and and send her the invoice. The only difference is she will deliver it to keep the pretense alive.", "As an adult, I find that I have most things that I want/need already. I ask people to bring food to share to a potluck dinner for my birthday if I'm celebrating that year, or for a mickey of vodka instead of wine. My mom keeps buying me things I specifically said not to get. I'll ask for \"socks\" or \"a gift card for Indigo so I can buy books\" or I'll say \"here is a link to an item I want but do not need but would like to own\" and what I get is a shirt that I will not wear with no tags or receipt to return it. \n\nI also don't love gift giving as a concept. You gave me something I don't want so now I'm obligated to get you something you don't want and we keep giving each other things we won't use which is such a waste of money, and especially if it's wrapped up - a waste of paper! Or plastic! \n\nOP is NTA and I totally get it.  I'd rather spend time with people or having experiences than accumulating more junk than I already have.", "I have a deal with friends that unless it is something meaningful then we don't. If it is family give me a dollar amount and i will tell you what to contribute to.", "AND that she buys trinkets (plural) from the dollar store when left to her own devices, makes this a NTA.", "Also, it seems environmentally wasteful. If the objects go the thrift store okay. But if they end up in landfill, that\u2019s just painful", "I think you put it well also. You said you harideas under 10 dollars on your list,  might be worth it to find some things under $5.\n\nI always have coloring books and little things I would like but don't need. Keychains and such.", "I feel like that would be fair if the situation was that she gave me something and i told her \"no thanks, i dont want that.\" In the past, when she gave me junk, my response was always polite.\nI havent refused any gifts from her, ive just told her ahead of time that i would prefer to receive nothing at all, rather than random trinkets that I have no use for.", "I don\u2019t see care in the gifts mentioned. I see convenience. \nI\u2019m not a trinket person. If you want to spend a dollar on a cookie, that\u2019s a much more thoughtful gift than sparkly animal cards", "I agree with you. We obviously don\u2019t know the family dynamics but I can tell you all ppl in my family make lists. But we still go out to buy random things for each other (or at least me and my brother does). And it\u2019s the most exciting thing ever! I don\u2019t NEED the plastic unicorn I got but it\u2019s cute someone went out their way to think about what I would like for a gift. \nAnd your sister don\u2019t have a lot of money but still go out trying her very best to buy gifts. I get the impression OP would not do the same tbh with she was low on money.", "My ex MIL was exactly the same, and my ex wouldn't let me get rid of any of the tat in case she asked where it was. My dad and my brother have given up on gift giving almost entirely: we all have lots of stuff that we already like so instead of buying new stuff we all just pitch in for Christmas dinner. If we get gifts at all it will be a new book each that we all want.", "Hey OP, I'm like you - I prefer things I actually need/can use over random junk (even more so now that I'm older). I've also ALWAYS made lists for exactly this reason.\n\nAt the same time, I understand some people love to give as an act of love so I've tried to find a happy medium between \"please don't buy me random shit\" and \"I know giving gifts makes you happy\". I always throw in a line about loving things that are consumable. For example, my husband and I love a good wine and cheese night so I throw some nice crackers on my list that are maybe $5 at the grocery store but will definitely get eaten. Is there anything like that you could suggest?\n\nNTA btw. I get why she's hurt but also totally get where you are coming from.", "In my opinion, timing doesn't matter.  Telling her in advance that you would prefer not to receive that gift is the same as having it in hand and saying \"I would have preferred if you hadn't given me this.\"\n\nOuch.", "My ongoing \u201cthese are the things that would make great gifts\u201d list has everything from $2 bike parts to an $8,000 bike and lots of stuff in between. And I always appreciate race entry fee contributions (can\u2019t afford a gift but still want to get something? Send me dollar and tell me to apply it to my next race entry and I will be thrilled). Yet still there\u2019s a person who buys useless trinkets. At that point it\u2019s about them and not trying to do something nice for the other person. \n\nIt sounds like OP\u2019s sister is that type.", "There\u2019s really no reason to make them feel bad about what works for them. Thats how THEIR family operates. YOUR family can do what works for you", "When you post an a sub called \u201cam I the asshole\u201d asking for peoples opinions guess what you\u2019re gonna get\u2026peoples opinions. \n\nDon\u2019t ask my opinion in a public forum if you don\u2019t want to hear it."]}
