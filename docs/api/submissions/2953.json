You can be honest and still be tactful.\n\nYou didn't have to tell her you've thrown away her dollar store gifts before. You could have simply said: Money's tight so let's skip gift giving this year. Maybe do a free activity together or something else.", "YTA.  I get what you were trying to say, because I've never really liked small little dust-grabbers myself.  But you basically told your sister that her gift giving skills are shit and you'll only be happy if she buys you a thing from your list.

We\u2019re old enough now that we\u2019ve all accumulated a lot of \u201cstuff\u201d and don\u2019t really want to add to it. \n\nMy sister has also been abroad the last 2 years. We\u2019ve just said, for Christmas and Birthdays, to not bother buying anything.

Just act grateful and let her enjoy the act of giving. What you do with the dust-catchers after the fact is your business. So, soft YTA.", "YTA, be grateful already wtf is wrong with you. We\u2019ve all had family members give wasteful gifts or ugly clothes.

You're telling her that her gifts are not good enough for you. You say that you appreciate her effort, all while actually not appreciating it. \n\nI have a family member that didn't have a lot of money. On Christmas last year, they got me something I already had. I showed excitement because even though I didn't need it, they got it for me when they didn't have much to give to start with. I would have appreciated something for $1 if that's what they had got me. \n\nThat is appreciation. \"Don't get me anything if it's not something I want\" is not a nice way to be.", "YTA.\n\nYou're a grown woman. Why on earth are you making Christmas gift lists for yourself?", "YTA.

You're not being an AH. My family and I do the same thing. Theres nothing wrong with you being honest with your sister. I suspect that her reaction is more to do with her feeling bad that she cant afford more and took it out on you. You're not responsible for her taking what you said so personally.", "YTA\n\nYou could have said this many other ways. For example, why don't you just suggest she buys you a book? A book is cheap, fun to read...etc.\n\nSurely there are other cheap ideas (T-shirt, socks with Santa design..). But don't send her to your wishlist, that's rude and offensive. Maybe you listed there expensive stuff too.", "YAH.  \nWho's your age with a Christmas list??", "ESH.  I don't understand why making a Christmas list as an adult is bad.  It is a good way to put down little inexpensive items that you would like.   Family members shouldn't have to read your mind to know what you want.  You suck for not being grateful.  Just appreciate that she's thinking of you.   Putting down shampoo/conditioner or bath bombs or something small and cheap would be a good gift idea.", "NTA as there are affordable items in the list. A gift is not meant to be an obligation, but as lists seem to be a tradition in your family and the price is reasonable I don't see why she can't choose from there.", "Can\u2019t somebody think about the planet?!", "The cheapest thing on my list is $8. I could probably add some cheaper household items though, thats a good point!", "I guess my opinion going into it was its shittier to secretly throw away or otherwise dispose of a gift than it is to ask the person not to get anything in the first place. That way, shes not spending money on something that will just go in the trash", "I have boxes of this kind of clutter, and all it means is I have to now hold on to it until I can reasonably dispose of a well-meaning \u201cthought\u201d.\nI hate them.

You're helping her make gift choices that won't be wasting her money.

You sound entitled af", "NTA because your sister overreacted to a simple and fairly common sentiment - most people in their 20s don't want or need trinkets.\n\nThat said, you probably could have phrased it better. It sounds like gift giving is important to your sister since she makes an effort even when she's broke.\n\n I would told her that, while I appreciated that she wanted to get me something, she should instead use the money to do a little something nice either for herself or her son because it makes me happy when my family is happy.", "NTA - I also use a gift list I curated myself. There are things such as household items on it (poop bags for the dogs for example) that are not expensive.   \nAnd people still give me things that aren't on the list, just because. Things I have no use for, because they are of the opinion that a household item or something I'd buy for myself is not a real gift.   \n\n\nPeople, if it's something I want, I'll buy it for myself regardless of someone gifting me it, so why wouldn't they make you happy buying you something you specifically ask for?

Put toothpaste on your Christmas list or something else that she can get at the dollar store.  Just laugh when you get it\u2026 tell everyone you wanted it and thank your sister.  There is a middle ground here.", "NTA\n\nI think that you had to say it to her the way that you did. If you had just told her to save money and not get you anything, she would have definitely gone ahead and still gifted you with little trinkets. \n\nIt does seem like gifting, even if it\u2019s something small, is important to her. Like others have recommended, maybe add a few items under $5 to your list? If you give her time to calm down and try to explain it again (maybe without mentioning that you\u2019re throwing her gifts away- I know I know, but it hurt her feelings), maybe you can work things out?", "NTA. One of the best things I've ever done for myself was to talk my siblings into not exchanging holiday gifts.", "NTA. You\u2019re actually being pretty considerate, in my opinion. You\u2019re not asking for anything expensive, but you\u2019re thinking of making sure her money goes to something you\u2019ll use. \n\nMy sister and I give each other specific items to purchase for each other sometimes. Then we know the money will go to something we want and the giver knows their gift is really appreciated.", "NTA.   You could also suggest that she get you some consumable gifts this year.  Like your favorite coffee or tea or a baked good with the recipe in a card.", "NTA. I feel the exact same way. I would rather get nothing than get something I don\u2019t want or need.", "I'm going to go with NTA.

You weren't trying to be petty or rude and you don't expect an elaborate gift.", "NTA", "NTA.   \n\n\nI wish I could explain to my mother how it's better to just buy for people what they want instead of just buying crap. My fiance is on the opposite side of reason and always says \"You should be grateful she got you anything,\" WHICH I GET. But, it's better to purchase things that will serve their intended purpose rather than buying silly items that will serve an individual no purpose. $8 is not expensive. I imagine an individual Lego man costs close to $5. Why not adjust the money and purchase something that you can actually use.", "That's why I absolutely hate set occasions like Christmas or birthdays. It should be about being together, not being forced to find a gift just for the sake of giving a gift (or even making lists, for the same purpose, because well it's the \"time of giving\".

It's really great and we can all.hrt what we want.", "Yta I feel like giving should be the \"thought\" that counts. \n\nTelling her not to worry about getting you something isbone thing. Telling her get ne something off my list or nothing..  is a little different.\n\nI just never like it when gifts become expectations.", "I also think, OP, if you have gifts under $10, it's more reasonable. If your list only included $100+ items, it MIGHT change my opinion a little.", "Perk of moving away is people don't gift me \"useless\" stuff anymore, and if they do, I can just say that I don't have the luggage space to bring them with me.", "I wish I could explain this to my MIL. She's all about quantity over quality. And me and my husband give her lists of stuff we actually want (and it's not expensive stuff). But she'll go rogue and get us expensive stuff that, not only do we not want it, but will then add on several more cheap presents. She even numbers the presents (they get into the 30s) and makes a list so she can tell us which to open first. One year we got several fidget spinners, beer koozies, cardboard coasters, and ugly winter gloves/hats that were clearly used (and already had plenty). I love this woman and obviously her love language is gift-giving, but I hate the fact that she's 1. spending good money on stuff we don't want and 2. spending even more money on cheap crap just to feel good about giving us a lot of presents.\n\nI'm thinking about limiting gifts to 5 per family member (from each person/couple) which I think is more than enough but I'm worried she'll get upset. We have a 2yo and I just think this is going to get worse and worse each year if I don't say something now.", "In principle, I agree with you. I hate when people give me trinkets. On the other hand, it made them feel good to get me that thing and making them feel bad is the worse sin.", "That's true. My assumption for her buying the trinkets wasnt necessarily that it make her feel good to give the gifts, but that she felt obligated to make sure she bought at least something for everyone. I think she feels good about giving gifts when she's found a really cool thing she knows we'll like (last year i got a mug from etsy that was a bunch of penises in santa outfits, LOVED IT) I just wanted her to know that she shouldn't feel obligated to buy me something if she doesnt have extra money.", "People on this thing don't read they get mad and reply", "I feel like your last line is exactly what you should say to her! I think in the case you\u2019re NTA for telling her not to buy some junk you\u2019re going to throw out. It\u2019s wasteful for everyone. Tell her you would rather her put the money towards her vacation this year, and maybe next year you\u2019ll exchange better gifts. \n\nI think it\u2019s clear you care about your sister OP. You just don\u2019t need her to spend money on useless junk to prove she loves you."]}
