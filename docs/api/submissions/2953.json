That's fine, i dont give two fucks about not getting a gift. Ive spent several holidays abroad where, obviously, i didnt give or receive gifts on holidays or birthdays.\nHistorically, when my sister has been pretty broke, she will buy little gifts for people from the dollar store. Usually, the gifts are useless junk that i dont want/need/have a use for. For example, one year she got me these sparkley animal trading cards, little action figure thingys, a little hispanic lego man with a sombrero (her and my other older sister are half Mexican and find little things like this to be charming) and this unicorn drinking cup. All of those items, except the cup which i still use, kind of sat around in boxes until an acceptable amount of time passed and they got thrown out during a deep clean. I am not a person who likes stuff that just sits around my house with no purpose. Ill hang cool art, but thats mostly it. I would say my sister has given me gifts like this 4 or 5 times in the past.\n\nAnyway, i told my sister that if she is unable to get something cheap off my provided Christmas gift list, then I don't want anything at all. She asked me why and i told her that i appreciate the effort she makes to give gifts, even when she doesnt have a lot of money, but im not the type of person who likes \"cute little things\" that serve no purpose and they would likely get thrown away eventually so it's better for her to not waste the money. She said i was being \"a shitty asshole\" and to get over myself.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: Everyone in my family makes Christmas list. All of my adult siblings, my mother, my grandmother, etc. Also, the list i made has several items on it under $10.\n\nETA 2: The way a lot of you look at gift giving is really strange to me. You give gifts to do something kind for the person you're giving them to right? If thats the case, then you should be willing to consider (to a certain degree) what that person does or, in my case, doesnt want. If you are buying gifts for Someone with an attitude of \"idc what you do/dont want im going to buy you what i buy you and god dammit you better be grateful because i didnt have to buy you anything at all\", then arent you really only gift giving to make yourself feel good or to fulfill a societal/familial pressuse that you feel obligated to fulfill?\n\nThere are a million different scenarios in which someone does something to be kind or helpful, but the reality is, what they're doing is making your life more difficult or inconvenient. One should be able to communicate the idea of \"hey, i can see you are doing this with the intention of being kind or helpful. Thank you, i appreciate that. However, it's actually making my life more inconvenient for X reason. So could you please stop?\"", "created_utc": 1669123231, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1tfo2/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_if_shes_not_going/", "score": 964, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nothing we tell her is expensive. We've even told her we're adults with our own kids so we don't need anything.  But she buys anyway so we figure if we tell her what we want, itll make it easier on her. That's better than her buying a ton of random stuff.

Then there is the guilt of working out whether you have kept the gift for the right amount of time or how to dispose of the gift without it becoming landfill or\u2026 a myriad of other issues.\n\nI have literally spent a decade on a campaign with my family to let them know how distressing gift giving is to me. I have literally told them that they think they are giving me the gift of a purse but actually they are giving me the gift of STRESS because I have about 30 purses that I already do not use.\n\nI have asked them to gift me experiences or take me out to lunch. I still receive purses.\n\nI am 100% on your side mate.", "NAH. \n\nBut!

If your sister doesn't know you throw most of her gifts away, why did you feel the need to tell her? You literally created conflict over something that wasn't an issue.

Maybe suggest she get you snacks or something instead? Or if there's something she makes you could ask her to make that for you?\n\nI'm not sure there was another way you could go about it than the way you did.

The worst kind of gift-giving is gift-giving for the sake of gift-giving, which is one of the ONLY things I hate about Christmas. If someone lovingly chose (or made!) something for me because they put thought and effort into it and genuinely thought I'd be thrilled, I'll love it no matter how much I may actually hate it. \n\nBut that's asking a lot. And that is the WOSRT thing about birthdays, Christmases, anniversaries, Valentine's Day, etc.--trying to come up with something \"special,\" something unique, something bespoke, something that says I see you and I know you and I love you and I cherish the person you are. I DO feel that way about several people in my life, but it's so much easier to just go to Target and buy them a sweater. \n\nI think that providing a \"want\" list is a caring thing to do. It provides the gift-giver with the opportunity to give something that is truly desired, so there's no wondering whether the recipient was faking their enthusiasm when they opened it, and it takes the pressure off the gift-giver to find \"just the right thing.\"\n\nMy mother thinks she is complimenting me when she tells me--every single Christmas--to just get her anything, that I have such a knack for finding \"just the right thing,\" when in fact this is an enormous amount of pressure.", "The way I read this, it screams that she thinks OP as an afterthought and buys this little stuff last minute so it appears she \"tried\".", "He said in the post he had a few items on the list under 10$", "Amazon has made gifting useless shit easier.

Amazon makes it so easy - I made one list with a bunch of things I like, update it periodically through the year as stuff no longer becomes available or I find something new to add, send it to both my family and hubby\u2019s, and never have to worry about duplicates being bought because it takes it off the list once it\u2019s been purchased.  I just have to behave and not sneak a peek ahead of time at what was purchased, lol. \n\nMy mom doesn\u2019t like the list concept though, gift-giving is her thing and she obsesses about getting amazing gifts for people.

If gift giving is just a way to get things you want it\u2019s terrible as you can get yourself things you want.

You gave her your list with some reasonably priced items and that should be enough! My siblings and I usually do gift cards to places we know the other likes so you can give $5 if that\u2019s all you have but if you have extra cash you can give $50. I understand how you may have hurt your sister\u2019s feelings but honestly, you\u2019re doing everyone a favor by being honest. When I was in high school and didn\u2019t have a lot of money, I would put together little snack baskets for my siblings. I would get nearly all the supplies from the dollar store and it was always a hit. Maybe that could be another idea for her if you have favorite candies/snacks?", "NTA as you told her not to get you a gift instead, which is better than getting junk that you don't like and ends up in the bin (very bad for the environment as well). She could spend the extra bucks on her kids, win/win. \n\nChoosing a gift should be about the receiver not the one buying it. Say my dad loves whiskey, I don't. Obviously I'll buy him whiskey (as long as it's affordable of course), because it's about what the other person enjoys. Most people I know do not appreciate junk just because people felt obligated to buy something... they rather get nothing. Maybe this is a privileged thinking pattern?\n\nI'd talk to her again, ask her why she's so set on getting you something that you don't enjoy. Maybe repeat that you won't be upset if you don't get anything (she might feel guilty) and that you'll happily just have the money she saves on you go towards your nephews/nieces and that spending time with them is enough for you as that's what's Christmas about. If she's still angry after that she's unreasonable.", "I hate lists. It's supposed to be about thinking of others and getting them something you think they would like.

I don't like random cheap and useless gifts like that either and I always end up donating them anyway. I'd also rather get no gift.", "Nta but I get both sides. You explained well the reasons why the lists are nice. This is something that has come up in my family the last two years- on my side of the family we shop throughout the year, buy things during trips and such (I like to travel) that remind us of the person we buy them for and, aside from when I was a little kid, we never did lists. My boyfriends family just started sending us Christmas lists last year and my initial reaction was that that\u2019s rude because I already bought them Christmas presents all year lol. But I just got them all some smaller items off their lists and added it to what I already bought them. And then both years I\u2019ve just declined to send a list myself because I would prefer to see what people pick out and I don\u2019t really want gifts of things that I need because I would rather just get them for myself and be surprised on Christmas, even if it\u2019s stuff I wouldn\u2019t buy myself- usually like specialty food or just cozy socks and things like that, I love that kind of stuff lol. But as long as they send me lists I\u2019ll kind of get less of what I get over the year (it\u2019s cheaper to buy throughout the year with a big family too) and then add stuff from their lists when they send them so that they get things that they actually asked for as well.", "NTA. I would think your sister would be happy to save the money. I don\u2019t won\u2019t a lot of junk in my house either so I agree with you.

It feels like a rejection of their affection if they're not good at emotionally regulating.\n\nIt's strange that she ignores the $10 or less gift options on your list. \n\nPerhaps you could word it in a positive way, versus a \"keep your trash\" kinda way (in vibe, not saying you'd actually say that).\n\nI had a old boss who was very much like you: well-established and didn't like knick knacks. Her family would donate to charities instead. Perhaps you could suggest she make a small donation - maybe in her kids' name, if she's hesitant. Or perhaps you suggest she instead treat herself to a little something in your name?\n\nBut no, you're not the asshole for not wanting more clutter.\n\nI throw out my holiday cards and feel guilty every year, but then I look around and don't see yellowing generic Hallmark shit and I feel better.", "Don't be so materialistic and petty. Let her get what she can. You give her what you feel like giving. Making it an argument only intensifies the bad feelings. Smoke a reefer, give head and chill", "I feel the same way. I have so much shit that I end up tossing. A gift I won't use out of obligation is more of a hassle. The most meaningful gifts I have received are \"I was in the store and this made me think of you.\" Christmas stresses me out bc I have to buy stuff for other adults who already buy what they want and then I receive things that I'll never use.

I HATE making Christmas lists. Any wants I have I just never feel right asking for them. But that's just me. If you don't personally want someone because it's not on your list you definitely sound a bit like an asshole. Maybe tell her instead of giving you nothing, because to her it probably hurt her feelings a bit. Maybe tell her you'd appreciate a nice card or a Christmas ornament that HAS a use, but doesn't sit around all year without a purpose? If that makes sense. She can buy those clear ornaments pretty cheap and decorate the inside to be special. That way she's still able to give you a gift without feeling rejected AND you don't have to worry about it having no purpose.", "NTA\n\nWow I wish this more a more common practice. Would make gift giving season so much less time consuming and stressful.", "For REAL. I do not wear yellow gold jewelry. Yet my ex-fiance constantly got me yellow gold ( and tacky) jewelry. He gave me an engagement ring with a blue topaz and yellow gold which I SWEAR came from a Bazaar. I put that in a drawer and bought my own.

I don't really value gifts I'd much rather spend time together making memories.", "I really love this idea. Especially if the giver wrote some funny/sweet/personal things on the toothpaste, etc. It'd make me smile every time I used it, which is also very help when brushing ones teeth.", "My entire family decided about 10 years ago to just stop giving gifts entirely. It felt like a weird obligation and tradition, so we stopped it. Started writing \"appreciations\" to each other in the form of a little note about what we loved/appreciate about the person.\n\nThat was way more valuable. We're still able to give gifts obviously, if we know someone really wants or needs something practical but man it took a lot of the stress away from holidays. Also, we made a rule where no politics are allowed to be discussed at family gatherings. I like that one."]}
