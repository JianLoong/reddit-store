Friday was the only day my husband had off and we needed the tires looked at. Well it took them 7 hours to replace them and so I was late to picking her up to leave. I believe we would have had plenty of time to make it (she says otherwise) and while we were leaving and still in town she goes just take me home. And starts saying things about how the night is ruined and that my husband and I needed to grow up and should have had the tires fixed sooner. My MIL had paid for the tires using her credit card and had just given it to us the day before for said tires. My husband works from 9am to 7pm so any tire place is closed by the time he gets off of work and that days of the event was his only day off. \nShe said that she was breaking up with me and when she got out of the car she said good luck on your medication journey (I started new meds Sunday) and left. \n\nWell she's been still messaging me off and on.  She said that \"I broke up with you, why aren't you begging me to take you back\" and \"if you show up at my door then I know you wanna fix things\". \"I thought our love was stronger than that\" \"I thought our love was you knocking at my door until we fixed things\" \n\nMy husband and I have been talking about how bad the two year relationship really was and I'm starting to see it.

Yeah I'm seeing this now and I'm just trying to heal from it", "\ud83d\udcaf this", "I never thought the med comment as an insult until now. I just thought of it as a further reason why she was solidifying the relationship being over", "She always wanted me to fight for her and prove my love for her when we got into fights", "She wanted me to drop everything for her. To the point I even picked my work schedule around her so I could see her on my days off and after work.", "I used to chase exs in the past. But I learned from that. It's hard but everything is screaming for me to. But I'm fighting it", "First, you gotta be worth chasing. Being manipulative to get a specific reaction is not it. Congratulations on the break up, OP! May you, your husband, and any other potential future partners have a wonderful and lovely polycule.", "Thank you. That's how I've been trying to look at it", "I used to in past relationships. But when she ended things it was like I just went \"ok\" and didn't have the urge to fight or beg.", "Thank you! I'm certainly seeing that now", "Thank you. Yeah he has been supportive this entire time", "She expressed that she wasn't happy at times. We would do all we could to always include her in everything we did. Sometimes she would get upset over the smallest thing. \nI understand that she was upset about me being late to picking her up. Which was only like 30 mins and we still had plenty of time to get there.", "She knew I was starting new mental health meds soon. And I had asked her to be there for me when I started them.", "She offered to pay for them as a gift to us. \nI do work. I work full 8 hour shifts like he does. I never forced a poly relationship on him as he also wanted to date her as well", "NTA.  Honestly, this reminds me of my ex-wife.  She left one day while I was at work, leaving me with a note saying that she was going to 'find herself' and not to contact her, that she'd contact me when she was ready.  Not only did I not contact her, I filed for divorce the next day.  Of course, it mystified her why I wasn't constantly calling her and begging for her to return, at least until she got served with the papers. (I was close with her sister's bf as we'd known each other since third grade).  Anyway, that was two decades ago, I'm now married with two kids. (Thankfully didn't have any with the first wife.  She'd have used the kids to get everything she wanted from me.  There's a reason that to this day I still refer to her as \"The Anti-Christ.)", "It could be what you thought it was. It sounded like an insult to me though.", "Is she a character in a romcom movie?", "Thank you! Yeah we weren't looking for anyone and it just sort of happened. We're just going to take some time for ourselves and heal from this.", "Good. Break ups are final, the fact that people use that as manipulation is disgusting", "Yea, see ? Girl, you are good ! Spend some time with your hubby and maybe later he can help you vet some non crazy people for future relationships. Emphasis on the **not crazy** part", "Hindsight it sounds like one now", "That was something I always was lost by. She said too that if you don't fight you don't have passion. My husband and I hardly ever fight.  So we don't have passion according to her", "He's a really good judge of character too. And she just had us both fooled in the start.", "She obviously thinks very highly of herself as well, telling you that you should be begging for her to take you back. People like that are destined to be alone. Good on you and hubby realizing the relationship wasn't a great one anyway.", "She thinks she is in a movie and not in same reality with us", "There were signs,  that I obviously missed. But we would get into fights about how she felt like we weren't giving her enough attention too. When we both work and she doesn't (she's on disability for a terminal illness) and how lonely she was.", "She grew up with toxic love. Her parents always fought and were abusive to each other. So I feel like that's all she's ever known and that's what love is to her", "Can't blame yourself for missing signs.  Everyone has some type of blinders on when they're in a relationship. She definitely sounds high-maintenance though. Some people have to work.  Sucks she has a terminal illness, but her saying she was lonely and you two weren't giving her enough attention when you have to work to support yourselves was emotionally taxing I'm sure", "Oh OP You are NTA and you need to block her.  Fighting is not an act of passion; your ex needs therapy.  The happiest time I've had was with my boyfriend, we don't ever fight, we discuss things, we do not insult each other.  Just stay away from her.", "It was. Then she'd get onto us about how we spent our money. After bills were done we'd sometimes buy a little treat for ourselves. My husband is into Warhammer 40K so he would get figures on sale every now and then. He's new to it but he loves it and I'm happy he has a hobby now. I know it's an expensive one but he's being smart about it. \n\nI couldn't even order food without her being like \"it's a waste of money\"", "OMG.  It is your and your husband's money! As long as you're bills are paid, who cares what you do with the extra?!?!?! Granted I do think cooking at home is more financially responsible, but it's ok to treat yourself to not having to cook once in a while.", "Yeah. We cook often. So like on paydays we'll go out and buy groceries and pay bills. Then maybe pick something up to eat. Cause we'd both be so exhausted. We just stopped telling her that we ordered food."]}
