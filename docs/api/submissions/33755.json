You can get your own space at your dad\u2019s so that is where you went. You just need to explain to your mom your reasons and that it\u2019s not personal, you just want to be comfortable. Trisha is probably more comfortable having YOUR room to herself for a bit as well.\n\nAll this adult shit, the divorce and dating again is super hard especially when you have kids so don\u2019t be too hard on your mom for how she reacted. It sounds like she is going through a lot and is sad about it. \n\nThis also sets a precedent that if your mom\u2019s boyfriend and Trisha were to move in down the line sharing a room is off the table which is a good thing. Putting boundaries up now I think is going to be a positive thing overall.", " NTA.  It\u2019s weird to expect 2 people to share a room when they don\u2019t know each other well.   Also your mother seems to care more about how John and his daughter are feeling than what your feelings were about the situation.   It may have been better for Trisha to have slept elsewhere in the house, like a living room, so you could have privacy when you wanted it.", "NTA for temporarily staying with your dad. You brought your concerns up with your mom and she discounted them. \n\nHowever, you could have done it in a way that didn\u2019t hurt anyone\u2019s feelings like talking to Trisha and letting her know she could have your room for several weeks, since you are both used to more privacy and like making plans to be there for dinner a night or two each week before going to your dads to sleep and for some time on Xmas.\n\nA judge is not likely to say that having a temporary roommate is sufficient reason to change the parenting plan in general but judges also give 15 year olds a lot of leeway.\n\nYou mom\u2019s feelings were probably hurt because it feels like you don\u2019t love her or want to spend time with her and she\u2019s angry because she is losing control over you, which is normal during teen years but can be hard for parents used to calling all the shots. Did she involve you in the decision-making process about whether they could move in?", "NTA. Just a moody teen. Legally, it's okay for you both to be in the room with bunk beds, and I understand not wanting to share a room at 15 with an 11yr old. Your dad should probably have had a convo with your mom if he didn't, but she does sound a bit, unreasonable. She sounds like she has a hard time seeing other people's POV. \n\nThe moody teen thing just means that 11yr old is annoying you and you don't really have the right hormones in place to have patience with her due to her age, and that's only due to your age. If you guys were blood relatives, you'd feel the same way as you do now. Do you think you'd wanna do go be with your dad if she wasn't your mom's bfs kid, but your actual sister? Probably to be honest, but also it wouldn't be a temporary situation it would be your life to share a room with someone that age.\n\n These are just things to think about, but again NTA, just moody.", "I don't see how is this a bad thing. Trisha house got burned so she had to share a room with a teen she barely know. not only this, but it seems that she and said teen just couldn't get along sleeping in the same room. \n\nSo you left to another house (which she doesn't have the privilege to do) and left her with a room for herself! so nice of you.

The correct thing would have been for your MOTHER to talk to her boyfriend and the boyfriend to make it clear to his daughter that she has to respect you wanting to sleep when the lights go out. No amount of trauma gives a person the right to be disrespectful. You have the best solution you can in the circumstances, live with your dad. Your mother should understand this.

It's not like they moved in permanently and just expected you to deal with it, this was an emergency.\n\nIn a few years, you won't remember what Trisha mumbled in her sleep, but everyone in that house will remember you packing up and leaving.", "NTA why is it that everyone in these comments is fixating on \"Your dad should have been better/you could have been nicer about this etc. etc.\" when the teenager was forced to share her bedroom at a moments notice with a child she doesn't know, the child of a boyfriend she barely knows?\n\nThere was an OBVIOUSLY BETTER solution available: there's TWO bedrooms. OP and HER MOM should be sharing one room and Trisha (i.e., the young girl traumatized by a fire and in a strange place) should be sharing the other room with HER DAD. If this is truly a temporary emergency situation this arrangement both makes the most sense and is in the best interests of both children. \n\nWhether or not the family ends up blended further in the future and the kids end up sharing a room permanently is besides the point, they don't KNOW each other right now and placing Trisha, who just went through an awful experience at Christmas, in a room alone at night with a teenager that doesn't know her and doesn't have the capacity to help soothe her at night if she's anxious (which could be why she keeps trying to talk to OP) was the dumbest decision. The two grown adults who are dating don't need to share a bedroom for a one month stay. They can leave the house if they want alone time. OP doesn't have that option (apart from going to her dad's for the duration). Once again, the interests of children placed below the desires of selfish adults.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure Trisha will appreciate having her own space as well, losing a home in a fire is so hard and she probably had her own room in the previous house.

His older sisters were subdued or crying, and it was bumming me out. Of course, my parents reacted with the appropriate level of horror and disgust that I could lack such empathy. Looking back on it now as a 36-year-old, I see that my discomfort was rooted in the fact that this family was an in-your-face reminder that terrible, terrible things could randomly happen to people, and I didn\u2019t know how to do deal with it. I\u2019m getting a lump in my throat just thinking about it. I wish I had had the emotional intelligence at the time to be more welcoming.\n\nWatching someone deal with grief and trauma can be uncomfortable at best. I encourage you to really think about the underlying reasons you do not like having Trisha and John around, and if any part of my story sounds relatable, sit down with your mom for a heart-to-heart. Bonus points if you apologize to John and Trisha. From there, I think it\u2019s okay if you want to stay at your dad\u2019s.", "NTA. The situation isn't a good one for you, and Mom saying that you're making them feeling like they are imposing, it is actually an imposition.

Expecting that you just endure graciously when there were alternate accommodations you could make for yourself is ridiculous.   \n\n\nI know I can be polite to people that I don't care about, but if there are other options, I don't want to be sleeping in the same room as them.

As your 15, this is a good chance for you to explore empathy and communicating your feelings.

While she might not be aware that she talks in her sleep (as someone who occasionally does, I didn't know until I got told), if she is, she should have warned you-that's what I do when I'm sharing sleeping space (bedroom, hotel room, etc) with folks who're not familiar with my behaviors once asleep. Your mom, once you told her, should have offered to get you something like noise-canceling headphones/earbuds to help with the situation. As the adults, it was on your mom and John to make sure that you and Trisha could share your room well. Once you brought up issues, they should have found ways to resolve them without you feeling like you had to move to your dad's.", "NTA.

Her having \u201cbeen through a lot\u201d doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t allowed to have boundaries about not letting her compromise your sleep just because she wants to chat. \n\nStaying with your dad until she has her own space again sounds like a kind and mature way to resolve the issue.", "YTA.

It's probably better for Trisha too. I think if you'd phrased it so that you were doing Trisha a favor too, it might have seemed like you were giving up your room for her comfort. \n\nBut the fact that she's literally keeping you up at night, and your mom dismissed that as no big deal, I would have done the same thing.", "NTA, but youre gonna be in for a shock when you move into your dorm in college when you might have 3 roommates not just one.", "ESH\n\nDad should have consulted mom, mom overreacted, and you're a kid, so your actions are the least damning, but alienating someone who was equally forced into this uncomfortable situation and pushing to get your way with this bratty attitude is bad form. \n\nIf kindness isn't your concern, I'd consider that mom might just have you stay at dad's permanently someday.

I\u2019m also curious if you were even asked beforehand. \n\nThis was a moment where she should have sat down with you and listened to what you had to say, as well as you ask more questions. It was a pivotal moment she could have used to teach you how to communicate your concerns to Trisha, and to help Trisha be more mindful about her behavior as well as respectful while she\u2019s in your space. \n\nHer blowing up and insulting you over this was completely uncalled for. That and everything she did after is what makes her TA. If she had a problem with you leaving she should have spoken to your father, because he is the one who offered for you to stay with him. At least he _did something_ instead of brushing off the problem and doing nothing about it. Your mother is the one who made John and Trisha feel unwelcome by making this a far bigger deal than it was, flipping out over this instead of being a good parental figure to you and Trisha, and painting you as some kind of villain when you never did anything to warrant it.", "NAH\n\nYou are an older teen, you want your own room; that's understandable.

Since she dropped off your gifts at grandma\u2019s I\u2019d guess she wanted you to have a nice Christmas. Ask your dad to help smooth things over with your mom so that you can stay with him and be able to go back to your room at your mom\u2019s when you\u2019re ready. If you were my kid in this situation, I\u2019d tell Trisha that she should make herself comfy in her room, sleep in whichever bunk she wants, etc, since you\u2019ve decided to live with your dad for now. You\u2019re no longer sharing that room, right? Be careful with ultimatums. They rarely work out the way you want. Fix things with your mom. Tell her you\u2019re sorry you walked out like that.

You really should\u2019ve just gritted your teeth and shouldered these minor inconveniences for another month and done a kindness for a person in true need.\n\nStill, your dad is the bigger asshole by far. There is no way he should\u2019ve offered this to you without first discussing it with your mother. It\u2019s so far across the natural boundaries of coparenting that he almost had to know he was out of line, and that leads me to believe that he was at least partially motivated by a desire to undermine your mother. That would be unacceptable in and of itself, but if I\u2019m correct, then using you to do it is truly deplorable. Additionally, doing it during the holidays is an added insult which also feels calculated.\n\nYour mom could be handling it a little better than she is, but she\u2019s in a tough spot. She can\u2019t push back against him without making it about you, and that\u2019s why your dad is so wrong for involving you at this level. It\u2019s a manipulative power play, and it\u2019s already creating a wedge of resentment between you and your mother. It can\u2019t be easy hearing yourself labeled a spoiled brat by your mom. She could\u2019ve left the \u201cbrat\u201d out, but I gotta say I agree with the \u201cspoiled\u201d part. Lots of people spend their entire childhoods sharing bedrooms with older/younger siblings with whom they didn\u2019t get along at the time and a lot of them had grievances that were far more valid than anything you\u2019ve mentioned; you were asked to deal with it for two months and you tapped out over hair and occasional sleep talk. That\u2019s pretty spoiled. I mean, you\u2019re literally talking about how you think a judge would see how bad this was and take your side, but that\u2019s laughably false. A judge would have no problem with this accommodation, and if your mom wished to force you to come back in keeping with the legal custody arrangement, she probably could. Think about why she\u2019s not.\n\nThis was a valuable opportunity for you to learn about being an adult and a member of a community.

One parent refused to get me a bedroom that they could have easily afforded and another parent made me share my room with 3 other people.

Your attitude behind this makes sense since you're still a teenager and your frontal lobe is still forming, but from an adult twice your age, you are definitely being an unwelcoming, unempatheric asshole. All Trisha wants in her situation is familiarity and comfort. She doesn't know you, she doesn't want to be there. She's attempting human connection and now she probably feels like a huge inconvenience just for existing.

When parents divorce and drag their new significant others and sometimes their children into your life, they often act like they're doing you some kind of favor because putting their happiness first benefits their children.

Then the parents carry on with their lives as if having stability for their (kid)s isn't important. It's disruptive to you to share a room with your mom's boyfriend's daughter. As long as you weren't unkind to the girl who lost her house, you haven't done anything wrong by choosing to stay at your other home. Living in two places is stressful. I went through it myself, and sometimes you need to pick one place for a while in order to take the best care of yourself that you can. Your mom's behavior reminds me of my own mother's after my parents' divorce. I was expected to constantly \"go with the flow\" and act grateful for having my life disrupted during an incredibly important developmental period. It was *always* *her* \"flow\" and never mine. It's selfish of her to expect you to conform your life around her personal life when you don't have to. She's made choices that make things harder for you and is throwing a tantrum when you do something to ease away from that difficulty. You don't get everything you want when parenting post-divorce unless you're granted full custody and your kid(s) are happy about it. Sharing parenting duties with someone you no longer live with as you both go about your lives is complicated, and the kids can so often bear the brunt of a parent's resentment of the natural consequences of their own actions.

So he wanted to move in with another relative. Judge told him to wear headphones and stay put. Judge was, frankly, irritated with the young man. \n\nNote: This was not my case. I was GAL for this young man\u2019s sibling and, thus, was in the courtroom for the hearing on custody. There was a related case with the sibiling that was a child dependency/neglect/abuse case. \n\nIf OP is anywhere in a state that has adopted strict 50/50 custody, there would be an issue with OP\u2019s assertion that they get to decide/have a say. There\u2019s now an overriding legislative and judicial philosophy in some states that the parents have to split unless there\u2019s a really,  really good reason not to (e.g., housing instability, mental illness, child abuse, allergic to pet). I\u2019ve seen kids forced to do some pretty wild commuting to accommodate this. Yes, even teens who no longer want to go back and forth. \n\nPS Not disclosing those states b/c that + things I\u2019ve said in previous posts would absolutely dox me. And there are crazy people here.", ">it\u2019s not about OP sharing the room, but that the other occupant consistently prevents OP from sleeping. Even temporarily asking a kid not to sleep for a month is an absurd ask.\n\nShe has been woken up 5 times, she's not being prevented from sleeping.", "I was a weird kid too so high five on that one. I\u2019ve practiced in SC, GA and AL. \n\nMy parents were always helpful. They wouldn\u2019t have questioned someone staying with us for a bit if their house caught on fire. I like to think they would have talked to me about it, but it depends on how it was presented to them. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s good- just how I grew up. I wouldn\u2019t do that to my child now though so I get what you\u2019re saying.", "10000%. It's the best outcome from shitty circumstances for the boyfriend and his daughter as well as op. She didn't pitch a fit and lock the girl out of the room, she didn't berate or bully her. She waited a month then mentioned it to her mom before being blown off so she went to her dad and found a good solution for everyone. Super mature if she actually did it all that way!", "So you teach them empathy by being unsympathetic with them and telling them to suck it up?", "Exactly, She is the parent but is acting like a child.", "Mom is definitely dealing with her own stressors and disregarding her child\u2019s. Maybe BF is hard to live with too and mom is struggling. It\u2019s not an excuse I\u2019m just spit balling out there. And I\u2019m not discounting this would be chaffing. I\u2019m just also not on team \u2018the world is ending\u2019 just team \u2018this is rough\u2019", "I\u2019m sorry but she\u2019s upset she had to share a room every other week for just a couple of months. With a girl who lost everything in a fire. When did people become so god damn selfish?", "I can't count the number of times, \"I didn't intend it this way,\" turned out horribly in my life, especially if someone had a plausible case to twist what I said to suit their agenda. In a sensitive situation, it's always best to keep conversations brief, informative, friendly, and firm (the BIFF method).\n\nIn one situation, I said to someone after their half apology, \"Thank you for apologizing to ______. It was the right thing to do even if you don't think it is...\" and that was enough to set him off with worse behaviour later on. Luckily, I didn't have to keep this person in my life beyond a certain period of time, so the *slightly* passive aggressive statement was worth it to say to someone who was completely unremorseful, recalcitrant, and unrepentant.\n\nI wouldn't suggest communicating in that style in a joint custody situation until all kids are adults and beyond university/college if there is any joint activity regarding tuition payments. Or if it's any other situation where it would be difficult to separate from the belligerent person in the short term.", "Her mom is the one who refused to try or suggest any strategies. OP went to her mom and let her know what the problem was. Instead of listening to OP or suggesting/spitballing solutions, Mom told her to essentially suck it up and deal with it. That's when OP went to her Dad's. If that is going to be Mom's attitude, she shouldn't be surprised that OP is going to retreat to the parent's house that actually listens to her and her feelings instead of dismissing them. Mom hasn't apologized for how she handled it and even skipped Xmas with her own child over this. \n\nThis is about way more than just sharing a room anymore and there are a lot bigger things going on here. OP should not need to be more of an adult than her own Mom", "None of the judges I\u2019ve ever seen would do anything other than tell OP to go home. \n\nShe can wear headphones or otherwise mitigate the sleep issues. The hair/other issues is not a reason to switch custody. She would be viewed as entitled.\n\nPlus, there\u2019s no indication she or dad actually consulted Mom or tried to work this out with her. She just went nuclear and dad enabled it.\n\nI say this as someone who hates having other people in my space. I hate, hate, hate it. \n\nBut this is short term. The only real issue is sleep. OP can mitigate that. \n\nOP and Dad do have an issue with failing to properly inform/work with Mom. \n\nAnd, honestly, she would come across as heartless and entitled if she told a judge she refused to deal with Trisha for another month (or less). After all Trisha has been through, the optics of this do not look good. And optics matter.", "Lots of comments in this thread tell me that people have never spent any significant amount of time in family court in a reasonably sized urban area. People have all kinds of different life and economic circumstances. Sharing a room for a couple of months would not make family court judges in my area give even half of a blink. \n\nThe last time I was in family court with my ex, the prior case was 2 grandparents taking care of a minor child. Real mom and dad were both homeless, addicted to drugs and autistic (I am not making this up). The homeless parents wanted the daughter back because \"they had just signed over custody to the grandparents to get the child insurance\". \n\nThe case prior to *that* case was a grandmother with a significant history of recent convictions for violent crimes who was there for confirmation of custody for her grand daughter. She was taking the grand daughter because the child's mother had been recently shot to death. \n\nSharing a room for a while? The parents would both get a lecture about talking to each other to work shit out, and a bunch of eye rolling from the judge.", "Why is it all on the OP to communicate with the mom? The mom is the adult in the dynamic. The mom should have ensured that the OP was okay with John and the daughter moving in before allowing them to do so, but it does not sound like OP was consulted. After being woken up the first few times, the mom should have found a solution.\n\n15 is old enough to know what they want, but it's not that old where they have to bear the majority of the responsibility over their parent.", "It depends. Some people take hours to get back to sleep after being woken up. So every time they get woken up, might mean they won't get enough sleep that night. Getting woken up with the realization of the circumstances could also be upsetting, making it more difficult to fall back asleep. Having to go through a whole school day sleep deprived would not be fun. Personally, I'd have called it quits after the 2nd or 3rd time if that were the case.", "I read it as 5 times a night. Very big difference, lol! Thanks for the correction.", "I\u2019d wonder if it was the opposite: Mom wants the bf to stay, and doesn\u2019t want OP rocking the boat and throwing up signs that maybe bf and kid moving in was too sudden an adjustment.", "The girl didn't lose everything in a fire. They had a fire at their house. Their timeline to move back in indicates that it just needs some repairs they have to be out of the house for before returning.", "This sub confuses what\u2019s \u201clegal\u201d with what\u2019s \u201cmakes or doesn\u2019t make you an asshole\u201d a lot. \n\nSure she \u201clegally\u201d isn\u2019t responsible to comfort this other girl. But she\u2019s an ah for her behavior. YTA", "It\u2019s very upsetting to have someone thrust into your space, to have NO privacy anymore, for \u201cuntil further notice\u201d, with you having absolutely no say or control over it. \n\nIf that happened to an adult it would be illegal.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not grateful to have a home. She\u2019s fully appreciating her *second* home, and giving Trish space. Where did she do anything negative other than have normal human feelings?", "Well, as noted, I agree that being careful with words is important. If a person is determined to have an argument, they will find an avenue of attack. You can only do your best.", "Honestly yeah, that's what decided it for me. I feel for Trisha and her dad, and get OPs mom is probably the best option for a temp place to stay. I get the mom wanting to help her bf and his daughter, and I can even get it if on some level she was hoping to treat this as a test run for her and her bf living together. I can also understand being upset the dad made the decision and pitched it to the daughter without talking to her at all first, since it's a decision about their child together, though if it were me I'd recognize it as a human error in judgment, and probably just get over it. But OP tried to bring up the issues she was having with her mom *first,* before she wound up complaining to her dad, so she *could* have tried to think of solutions with her daughter for the biggest issues, and talked through how to deal with things that are annoying but not actually hurting anyone to help her deal with things like Trisha trying to talk to her when OP is turning the lamp off to sleep. (In my head this 11 year old is 11 and seemingly an only child, so just wouldn't think \"person I'm sharing the room with is turning off the light, that means they want to sleep\" yet. So if OP were to have worked out a kind way of explaining to Trisha \"I get you wanna talk and probably aren't thinking of it, but when I turn off the light it's because I'm ready to sleep and I don't want to talk anymore, so please try to remember that and don't be upset if I don't respond after the light is on because I'll have earplugs and be halfway asleep most likely\" then Trisha might understand even and stop doing that so much. The hair I get is annoying when you're not used to it already, my own hair sheds enough it's annoying to me, but I think a lint roller is a good enough solution. And then plenty of people have suggested earplugs and headphones for being able to sleep, I'm sure there are other ideas too out there.) If the mom had suggested this stuff, and OP had run off to dad whining about it all still without trying any of them, I'd be more inclined to be understanding of the mom and think OP needs to grow up a bit, but the mom didn't do any of that, she didn't even think of the lack of sleep as bad enough to show concern or empathy over. She just basically said deal with it. So she told her dad how much it sucked, because why wouldn't she tell him about her current struggle in life when it's her father and she wants to vent and have someone act like they care about her feelings. And then to him the easiest solution, especially if it's only supposed to be for a few more weeks, is for her to just stay with him where she already has a room to herself, and no one has to worry about keeping each other awake on accident or resentment building from that lack of sleep and things can go back to normal in a few weeks. Sure he could've gone about things better in how it was executed, but he was ultimately looking out for his daughter.\n\nSomeone else made the suggestion in another comment, but I kinda agree with the thought the mom may well have wanted this to not be temporary in the end, and was planning to just have them never move back out as the kids were getting used to it and hoped they wouldn't ask until she and her bf had thought of an explanation to tell them. But now she can't do that, not without looking like she's choosing her bf over her daughter to most people, and any future living with him is going to feel much harder to figure out. Maybe that's not what's going on, but it's a possibility and it would explain why she's going as far as not seeing her child on Christmas over this after she didn't even try to offer her help.", "If its short term then it really shouldnt matter that shes with dad until this is cleared up. \n\nAs far as we can see she didnt make a scene ir make trisha feel bad. She disengaged.", "A person can get good sleep simply by sleeping in a different house, but she is somehow ethically obliged to endure weeks or even months of sleep deprivation or else she is an entitled brat? Wft? Do you comprehend that sleep deprivation is torture? OP's mother as well as this sub who want to pointlessly torture a person by unnecessarily inflicting sleep deprivation upon her are crazy. Especially, because in this case it is utterly pointless, since this girl can simply sleep in a different house. I understand enduring loud roommates when no spare rooms are available, but holy shit, why pointlessly hurt a person when more bedrooms are available?", "And how is OP supposed to mitigate it? She went to mom, mom basically said \"suck it up\". She went to dad and dad suggested circumventing the issue in its entirety.   \n\n\nOP is a child. Even if OP has the means (money+ access to actually purchase) it's not the responsibility of the child to ensure basic needs are met- its on the parents. \n\n(And that's assuming that OP would actually be able to sleep with noise canceling headphones or earplugs in.)\n\nOP asked her mom to make sure her needs are met. Mom failed to do so. OP asked her dad. Her dad is doing so.", "Preach", "Almost definitely a possibility my dear friend who is not a banana", "Perfectly well put"]}
