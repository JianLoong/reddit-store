You can get your own space at your dad\u2019s so that is where you went. You just need to explain to your mom your reasons and that it\u2019s not personal, you just want to be comfortable. Trisha is probably more comfortable having YOUR room to herself for a bit as well.\n\nAll this adult shit, the divorce and dating again is super hard especially when you have kids so don\u2019t be too hard on your mom for how she reacted. It sounds like she is going through a lot and is sad about it. \n\nThis also sets a precedent that if your mom\u2019s boyfriend and Trisha were to move in down the line sharing a room is off the table which is a good thing. Putting boundaries up now I think is going to be a positive thing overall.", " NTA.  It\u2019s weird to expect 2 people to share a room when they don\u2019t know each other well.   Also your mother seems to care more about how John and his daughter are feeling than what your feelings were about the situation.   It may have been better for Trisha to have slept elsewhere in the house, like a living room, so you could have privacy when you wanted it.", "NTA for temporarily staying with your dad. You brought your concerns up with your mom and she discounted them. \n\nHowever, you could have done it in a way that didn\u2019t hurt anyone\u2019s feelings like talking to Trisha and letting her know she could have your room for several weeks, since you are both used to more privacy and like making plans to be there for dinner a night or two each week before going to your dads to sleep and for some time on Xmas.\n\nA judge is not likely to say that having a temporary roommate is sufficient reason to change the parenting plan in general but judges also give 15 year olds a lot of leeway.\n\nYou mom\u2019s feelings were probably hurt because it feels like you don\u2019t love her or want to spend time with her and she\u2019s angry because she is losing control over you, which is normal during teen years but can be hard for parents used to calling all the shots. Did she involve you in the decision-making process about whether they could move in?", "NTA. Just a moody teen. Legally, it's okay for you both to be in the room with bunk beds, and I understand not wanting to share a room at 15 with an 11yr old. Your dad should probably have had a convo with your mom if he didn't, but she does sound a bit, unreasonable. She sounds like she has a hard time seeing other people's POV. \n\nThe moody teen thing just means that 11yr old is annoying you and you don't really have the right hormones in place to have patience with her due to her age, and that's only due to your age. If you guys were blood relatives, you'd feel the same way as you do now. Do you think you'd wanna do go be with your dad if she wasn't your mom's bfs kid, but your actual sister? Probably to be honest, but also it wouldn't be a temporary situation it would be your life to share a room with someone that age.\n\n These are just things to think about, but again NTA, just moody.", "I don't see how is this a bad thing. Trisha house got burned so she had to share a room with a teen she barely know. not only this, but it seems that she and said teen just couldn't get along sleeping in the same room. \n\nSo you left to another house (which she doesn't have the privilege to do) and left her with a room for herself! so nice of you.

The talking in her sleep she can\u2019t help. And it could be related to the fire. However talking to you after turning out the light is what can be handled. The correct thing would have been for your MOTHER to talk to her boyfriend and the boyfriend to make it clear to his daughter that she has to respect you wanting to sleep when the lights go out. No amount of trauma gives a person the right to be disrespectful. You have the best solution you can in the circumstances, live with your dad. Your mother should understand this.

It's not like they moved in permanently and just expected you to deal with it, this was an emergency.\n\nIn a few years, you won't remember what Trisha mumbled in her sleep, but everyone in that house will remember you packing up and leaving.", "NTA why is it that everyone in these comments is fixating on \"Your dad should have been better/you could have been nicer about this etc. etc.\" when the teenager was forced to share her bedroom at a moments notice with a child she doesn't know, the child of a boyfriend she barely knows?\n\nThere was an OBVIOUSLY BETTER solution available: there's TWO bedrooms. OP and HER MOM should be sharing one room and Trisha (i.e., the young girl traumatized by a fire and in a strange place) should be sharing the other room with HER DAD. If this is truly a temporary emergency situation this arrangement both makes the most sense and is in the best interests of both children. \n\nWhether or not the family ends up blended further in the future and the kids end up sharing a room permanently is besides the point, they don't KNOW each other right now and placing Trisha, who just went through an awful experience at Christmas, in a room alone at night with a teenager that doesn't know her and doesn't have the capacity to help soothe her at night if she's anxious (which could be why she keeps trying to talk to OP) was the dumbest decision. The two grown adults who are dating don't need to share a bedroom for a one month stay. They can leave the house if they want alone time. OP doesn't have that option (apart from going to her dad's for the duration). Once again, the interests of children placed below the desires of selfish adults.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure Trisha will appreciate having her own space as well, losing a home in a fire is so hard and she probably had her own room in the previous house.

His older sisters were subdued or crying, and it was bumming me out. Of course, my parents reacted with the appropriate level of horror and disgust that I could lack such empathy. Looking back on it now as a 36-year-old, I see that my discomfort was rooted in the fact that this family was an in-your-face reminder that terrible, terrible things could randomly happen to people, and I didn\u2019t know how to do deal with it. I\u2019m getting a lump in my throat just thinking about it. I wish I had had the emotional intelligence at the time to be more welcoming.\n\nWatching someone deal with grief and trauma can be uncomfortable at best. I encourage you to really think about the underlying reasons you do not like having Trisha and John around, and if any part of my story sounds relatable, sit down with your mom for a heart-to-heart. Bonus points if you apologize to John and Trisha. From there, I think it\u2019s okay if you want to stay at your dad\u2019s.", "NTA. The situation isn't a good one for you, and Mom saying that you're making them feeling like they are imposing, it is actually an imposition.

Expecting that you just endure graciously when there were alternate accommodations you could make for yourself is ridiculous.   \n\n\nI know I can be polite to people that I don't care about, but if there are other options, I don't want to be sleeping in the same room as them.

As your 15, this is a good chance for you to explore empathy and communicating your feelings.

While she might not be aware that she talks in her sleep (as someone who occasionally does, I didn't know until I got told), if she is, she should have warned you-that's what I do when I'm sharing sleeping space (bedroom, hotel room, etc) with folks who're not familiar with my behaviors once asleep. Your mom, once you told her, should have offered to get you something like noise-canceling headphones/earbuds to help with the situation. As the adults, it was on your mom and John to make sure that you and Trisha could share your room well. Once you brought up issues, they should have found ways to resolve them without you feeling like you had to move to your dad's.", "NTA.

Her having \u201cbeen through a lot\u201d doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t allowed to have boundaries about not letting her compromise your sleep just because she wants to chat. \n\nStaying with your dad until she has her own space again sounds like a kind and mature way to resolve the issue.", "YTA.

It's probably better for Trisha too. I think if you'd phrased it so that you were doing Trisha a favor too, it might have seemed like you were giving up your room for her comfort. \n\nBut the fact that she's literally keeping you up at night, and your mom dismissed that as no big deal, I would have done the same thing.", "NTA, but youre gonna be in for a shock when you move into your dorm in college when you might have 3 roommates not just one.", "ESH\n\nDad should have consulted mom, mom overreacted, and you're a kid, so your actions are the least damning, but alienating someone who was equally forced into this uncomfortable situation and pushing to get your way with this bratty attitude is bad form. \n\nIf kindness isn't your concern, I'd consider that mom might just have you stay at dad's permanently someday.

I\u2019m also curious if you were even asked beforehand. \n\nThis was a moment where she should have sat down with you and listened to what you had to say, as well as you ask more questions. It was a pivotal moment she could have used to teach you how to communicate your concerns to Trisha, and to help Trisha be more mindful about her behavior as well as respectful while she\u2019s in your space. \n\nHer blowing up and insulting you over this was completely uncalled for. That and everything she did after is what makes her TA. If she had a problem with you leaving she should have spoken to your father, because he is the one who offered for you to stay with him. At least he _did something_ instead of brushing off the problem and doing nothing about it. Your mother is the one who made John and Trisha feel unwelcome by making this a far bigger deal than it was, flipping out over this instead of being a good parental figure to you and Trisha, and painting you as some kind of villain when you never did anything to warrant it.", "NAH\n\nYou are an older teen, you want your own room; that's understandable.

Since she dropped off your gifts at grandma\u2019s I\u2019d guess she wanted you to have a nice Christmas. Ask your dad to help smooth things over with your mom so that you can stay with him and be able to go back to your room at your mom\u2019s when you\u2019re ready. If you were my kid in this situation, I\u2019d tell Trisha that she should make herself comfy in her room, sleep in whichever bunk she wants, etc, since you\u2019ve decided to live with your dad for now. You\u2019re no longer sharing that room, right? Be careful with ultimatums. They rarely work out the way you want. Fix things with your mom. Tell her you\u2019re sorry you walked out like that.

You really should\u2019ve just gritted your teeth and shouldered these minor inconveniences for another month and done a kindness for a person in true need.\n\nStill, your dad is the bigger asshole by far. There is no way he should\u2019ve offered this to you without first discussing it with your mother. It\u2019s so far across the natural boundaries of coparenting that he almost had to know he was out of line, and that leads me to believe that he was at least partially motivated by a desire to undermine your mother. That would be unacceptable in and of itself, but if I\u2019m correct, then using you to do it is truly deplorable. Additionally, doing it during the holidays is an added insult which also feels calculated.\n\nYour mom could be handling it a little better than she is, but she\u2019s in a tough spot. She can\u2019t push back against him without making it about you, and that\u2019s why your dad is so wrong for involving you at this level. It\u2019s a manipulative power play, and it\u2019s already creating a wedge of resentment between you and your mother. It can\u2019t be easy hearing yourself labeled a spoiled brat by your mom. She could\u2019ve left the \u201cbrat\u201d out, but I gotta say I agree with the \u201cspoiled\u201d part. Lots of people spend their entire childhoods sharing bedrooms with older/younger siblings with whom they didn\u2019t get along at the time and a lot of them had grievances that were far more valid than anything you\u2019ve mentioned; you were asked to deal with it for two months and you tapped out over hair and occasional sleep talk. That\u2019s pretty spoiled. I mean, you\u2019re literally talking about how you think a judge would see how bad this was and take your side, but that\u2019s laughably false. A judge would have no problem with this accommodation, and if your mom wished to force you to come back in keeping with the legal custody arrangement, she probably could. Think about why she\u2019s not.\n\nThis was a valuable opportunity for you to learn about being an adult and a member of a community.

Had this been done, it would have been a smoother transition with maybe a conversation about showing a bit of empathy for a traumatized 11yo whose house caught on fire. They should not have to share a room if another option is available, but having long hair, talking in your sleep or attempting to talk to you before you go to sleep doesn\u2019t make you the worst roommate either.", "Maybe, but for her mother to not even call over Christmas because she's angry? Pretty immature for a parent.", "I thought I was the only person seeing this.", ">I actually see it as considerate & generous to give up your room so that she can have her own space at this time.\n\nThis is a bad take.  OP's mom is the one offering the space, not OP.  OP is against it; that's why she's going to her father's house.", "Where is she supposed to get a big brother from, since OP is a 15-year-old girl?\n\nWhat stepsister? OP's Mom and boyfriend are dating, not married.\n\nWhy apologize when she's done nothing wrong?", "OP didn\u2019t invite any visitors, it\u2019s not on her to make them feel welcome when her mother never checked that they actually were welcome before moving them in. OP also tried to put up with it, and it wasn\u2019t working for her. She has another option, so she went there. The only asshole here is the mother who first moved her partner and his daughter in without considering her own daughter, then didn\u2019t listen when concerns were raised, and then ignored her own kid over Christmas.", "Why must the teenager be the bigger person when it's not her fault. Doesn't sound like she was given a say on this. Surely the boyfriend has his own family who could have helped? \nOp has done nothing wrong, tried to talk to mum and mum shit her down. So she is staying for the duration with dad.", "Is NTA! \n\nI don't see an explanation that justifies ESH. OP is nta that's the mother", "This is the answer to so many AITA!\n \nLike NTA, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to be friends with you/trust you with anything even moderately important lol", "Sleep deprivation makes you not very nice", "This is a great point.", "While I agree that mom took this as a chance to feel out what would happen if they moved in, an insured home does not always mean that you are provided comparable living arrangements in the event of a fire, just that you are provided living arrangements. Friends lost their home in a fire a few years ago\u2026 their family of six was put up in a hotel. They figured out an alternative themselves after several weeks, which was good given it took months dealing with insurance (their home was a total loss).", "Regarding the insurance thing just because the insurance says one thing doesn't mean they'll actually do it. I've had clients who's homes burned down and the insurance would only pay to let them stay somewhere for a few weeks", "This is what I was going to say.  Anyone I've known who had a house fire had rental reimbursement from their insurance policy until the house was liveable.  Mom was planning this all along, she just had a push from the fire.", "Has the OP mentioned anything about the custody agreement or how it is organised, though? I have no idea what jurisdiction they're in, but when I was growing up not all families bothered with a court-mandated custoday order. And in incidences where one was in place, the courts of our state didn't bother enforcing how children under split custody spent their time between parents once they turned 13. Unless one parent was an absolute garbage fire.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo this might seem irresponsible at first blush, but really, she can only work in the framework that her parents have set up. And I don't think we have enough information about that.", "Oh yes, the horrible plight of hair.  I'm assuming OP is bald and has zero pets.  Otherwise it sounds like she's looking for any reason to be selfish.", "Who says they will? I only ever had one roommate before moving in with my significant other. \n\nAnd when I did we didn't share a room, we shared an entire apartment.", "Sharing a room as a 15 year old is different to sharing as an adult. The levels of maturity differ greatly as well as the brain being grown and learning to deal with these things", "This is it right here.  I 100% agree with you.", "OP doesn't reply in the comments. Probably fake.", "I don't know how there are so many NTA.  THE HOUSE BURNED DOWN. They are close to the same age, same gender, and OP says they get along. They aren't even sharing a bed.  The parents aren't doing this to be cruel or as a punishment or because they are trying to force the girls into being sisters.  The house burned down.  Telling this 15yo girl that because she is totally in the right is straight up wrong.", "Are you serious?  There was a fucking fire.  There are 2 beds.  They are close to the same age and ARE the same gender.  They get along by her own admission.  Reddit is wild sometimes.  Especially about this kind of stuff.  This is what happens with life.  They weren't trying to punish or force them into being a family.  There was an emergency. Their house burned down", "Nothing about the mother moving in an unrelated adult male without informing the courts or the father?\n\nAnd you wonder why the father moved his daughter out so quickly? >.>", "You're petty. You assume teenagers are just assholes out of the gate. It's a gross take.", "Amen or. Ive heard of some orders with no sharing", "Well op tried to talk to mom, but mom got mad and demanded op suck it up and they\u2019re a brat because...  they feel uncomfortable with this person in their space? And also losing sleep?\n\nNow please explain to me what is normal and an enriching growth activity about suddenly having an 11 year old you barely know at 15 shoved into your room?\n\nNow you can say you have a random roommate you don\u2019t know in college/possibly in an apartment. But that means you chose that at the very least. You could set up house rules ahead of time, work it out so you have your own space even. Doesn\u2019t sound like op ever had a chance to do this.\n\nYou could say that they are a stranger who could be any age, but oh well, the great thing about that is again you chose it, and they will also be at least 18 if not older.\n\nAnd with a roommate situation if there\u2019s an issue such as being woken up 5 or 6 times a night or your roommate is having issues in say college dorming, you have this thing called an RA that you can talk to to help, which in this case in mom. Who failed amazingly considering she sees her kid as a brat for again\u2026 not getting enough sleep, not used to dealing with the unconvinces of having an unwanted roommate, for having valid emotions that does not mean she lacks compassion.\n\nNow, I really would like to know how this is so very normal or an enriching growth activity if you wouldn\u2019t mind actually explaining it as op as far as we are aware has not been unkind or disrespectful and did in fact try to talk to her mom, yet was shot down, yelled at, and now her mom hasn\u2019t even spoken to her not even on Christmas", "The girls 11 & just lost her house to a fire, in my view there's no need to pile additional stress on to her. Especially when sleep talking is a stress response for many and likely there's nothing she can do about it. I agree with OP & her mom the options were to stay at her dads or suck it up. Staying at her dads was clearly the best answer imo", "Youre right, op shouldnt deprive herself of growth, teenagers need proper sleep to grow, op isnt getting that proper sleep at her mothers house, infact her sleep is interrupted 5 to 6 times a night, soon op will start to become irritable, aggressive, and may actually hurt someone, sleep deprivation is a real problem. \n\nOp did the emotional mature thing, instead of sitting in these emotions, letting them fester, op removed herself from a sleep deprevation chamber, now she is able to sleep properly, and may actually be able to handle any further situation maturaly, because shes not constantly tired", ">It would also be a good exercise to be compassionate and focus on someone else\u2019s needs.\n\nWhich OP is. But OP's need of sleep isn't being met. It's the only thing that made OP move to her dad's. I'm sorry, but sleep is a vital need, and to ask her to put that need below another persons non-vital needs is crazy. \n\nIf OP is being interrupted every night by either sleep talk or her outright starting conversations with OP after bedtime or the middle of the night, then OP has the right to prioritize herself.", "> The fact you don't want to spend time with your mum because you have to share a room is bratty\n\nWhere did OP say she \"didn't want to spend time with her mum\"?  She doesn't want to share a bunkbed with a snoring 11-year old.", "I don't think it is fair to call OP the AH. She tried to talk with her mom to solve the issues she was having and her mom just told her to shut up. Leaving for her dad's was the best thing she could think of.\n\nI will add though, that OP could have talked to Trish to try to solve the issue but who knows if that's even a possibility.", "OP is not kicking anyone out, she's removing **herself** from a situation she was put into with no regard to her wellbeing. OP hasn't complained or tried to kick the girl out, she found a solution in which the girl gets to have a roof over her head, and OP can her sleep and privacy. \n\nYou don't get to scold OP about empathy while denying her any empathy.", "Mom moving in her homeless boyfriend can keep them in her room, her first duty is to her actual child and she does not have space for other people", "Mom had to have known a 15 year old wouldn\u2019t want to share a room with an unknown 11 year old.", "She can\u2019t sleep at night. That\u2019s a problem.", "A few will suggest that you think the fire was intentional. And browbeat you for it. Unbelievable!\n\nMANY (including me) will understand that this may not be just a temporary move til the horrible problem of having lost their home is otherwise remedied. It might very well be mom's (and maybe Boyfriend's) plan to never move back out.\n\nI bet OP's dad will contact mom as to what \"the plan\" really is. Mom not only moved a young girl into her daughter's room, she also moved an adult male into her house.", "So, to add to her sense of entitlement and incredible lack of empathy, OP is also so immature that when she brought it up to her mom and didn\u2019t get her own way, she whined and cried and ran away? Not painting a very good picture of OP\u2019s character. Lack of sleep can be easily solved with a pair of earplugs. It\u2019s for a couple of months. OP is not behaving kindly nor maturely. \n\nI vote YTA.", "Maybe brat is too strong a word, I don't really have a good feeling as to the strength of emotions linked to words.\n\nBut her just picking up and leaving after finding a solution is what made her mom angry. There should have been a conversation there.", "Not to link, but a personal one from a family member. Where I am, kids don\u2019t get to choose where to live-it\u2019s decided by the parents (my parents got divorced as well and was told by 3 different lawyers as such). My cousins were forced to see both parents after they divorced even though their dad was abusive because the custody agreement was equal 50/50 split.", "\u2018Bigger place? Nah. OP will be 18 and out of here in 3 short years.\u201d -Mom, possibly.", "I\u2019m sorry but children are not equal stakeholders in family decisions.  While this situation is an inconvenience, maybe - *just maybe* - it\u2019s also a teachable moment that sometimes we make sacrifices for people in need.  Parents are well within their rights and obligations to make decisions like this.", "Yes best to destroy relationships over the slightest inconvenience. Totally how we should all behave. Hopefully that\u2019s how your family and friends feel about you too. Or do you assume you\u2019re so perfect that nobody could ever be mad at you?", "And did the mom even have a conversation with OP before she moved 2 new people in?\n\nDoesn't say. But it also doesn't sound like it. \n\nA conversation here might have made the transition a whole lot smoother, no?", "I don't see where op blamed Any of this on Trisha", "The packing and leaving to go to the dads without giving the heads up right before Christmas is what tipped it to the ESH, though if I were to be honest it\u2019s leaning more towards the NTA. \n\nWe\u2019re also only getting the teenage girls perspective here. The \u201cshe blew up on me\u201d should probably be taken with a grain of salt. \n\nIf the mother was mad-mad she would not have made the effort to take the Christmas gifts over to the grandmothers where she knew OP would be.", "lol yes!!!", "Oh please \ud83d\ude44 \n\nIt\u2019s expected that pregnant people, people with newborns, people with toddlers, people with insomnia or anything else are still nice even when they are severely sleep deprived. \n\nA 15 year old is old enough to recognize that an 11year old might need some grace.", "The standard \"temporary living expense benefit\" is 24 months and equals the value of renting a similar home/apartment and renting furnishings to accommodate. The policy language is mandated by Statute in Every State and is virtually identical in every state. (I'm an insurance attorney and practice in multiple states and handled countless fire claims for a variety of insurers) .. If the insurance company isn't complying with the policy language, it's up to the insured and their public adjuster to press that insurer to comply with the policy terms. Honestly most insurers have a third party company handle temporary housing and that company has connections in the rental market, presents the homeowner with options to choose from. It's quite rare for that benefit to be an issue given the statutory mandates", "They reimburse you. It\u2019s rarely money up front", "There are two bedrooms available. No one is going without a place to sleep. The mother is the only person inconvenienced by OP staying with her dad in that she doesn't get to see her daughter as much as she might like to - which as you point out, is pretty minor in the scheme of things.", "I didn't see where she said the 11yo snores. She said she woke her up talking in her sleep x6 times in a month. Which is max 1to2 x a week. Nothing to say the talking even woke her up vs she woke up like we often do in our sleep and then she hears the talking. \n\nWhen the point of moving back and forth is partly to see her mum and she doesn't want to come, she is showing it isn't important to spend time with the mum. Which will of course be upsetting to the mum.", ">She tried to talk with her mom to solve the issues she was having\n\nI didn't see solutions. I only saw complaints", "It doesn't say the mum told her to shut up. The mum said be nice, it's not forever and rightly pointed out that the things OP was complaining about were minor issues. \n\nBoth could have done more to address the situation, hence ESH, but refusing to come home is ungrateful to the mum and an overreaction to possibly being woken up a handful of times in a month. \n\nVacuum more often\nAsk the 11yo to stop talking after the light are out\nWear ear plugs or cover your ear with an arm on the occasions that the girl is talking in her sleep\n\nLots of less OTT reactions", "Oh I see what I did. I said it was 'all a plot' when I should have made it clear that by plot I mean to take advantage of the situation in a way that is dishonest. Very poor phrasing, long day lol.", "She didnt whine or cry, she told her mother the problems, her mom said suck it up, op found a solution that fixes everyones problem, the immature thing would be to stay in the room, slowly build up a festering rage to the point she hates her potential step sister, permanently ruining any potential relationship they could have had", "Also, i really dont suggest sleeping with earplugs in, depending on the person it can damage your ears, my grandmother slept with them in, one slipped to far in and she needed to go to the hospital", "How is \"you can have this bedroom, I can just go to my dad's\" not giving Trisha some grace?\n\nWhy does \"grace\" have to be quietly accepting these discomforts *when there's an option that costs no one anything?*", "My neighbors had to move in with  their mom cause it was a while before insurance approved a place and cut the check. This is not that weird", "Forcing a 15-year-old to suddenly share a room with an 11-year-old stranger is a burden you're just waving off.

It's not OPs job to pretend it's not a burden or intrusion, or to make sure her mother doesn't feel bad about it.   \n\nAgain you make the leap that it means OP doesn't want to be around mom.

That's hardly going to stunt her growth. I'm sure most teens skip a few mins of sleep way more often. \n\nI'm sure the mum does plenty for her because she's doesn't mention being neglected so yes she should make some allowances to see her mum. \n\nI disagree that the mum polite meant shut up. What did you expect the mum to do about a bit of hair and an 11yo occasionally talking when the daughter wanted to sleep?", "4 weeks ago, 2 weeks at moms, 14 days sleeping there and about 6 of the nights woken up, that is pretty much every other night she\u2019s being woken up.", ">It was once, occasionally twice a week she heard the girl talking.\n\nSo?

What did you expect the mum to do about a bit of hair and an 11yo occasionally talking when the daughter wanted to sleep?\n\nShe could have gotten OP ear plugs, for starters. Instead she chose to do nothing and instead told her to shut up. \"Being nice\" means \"don't complain\" which means \"shut up about this\".", "A month ago is maybe 31 days so maybe more than 2wk at mums, plus only 5 or 6 (likely less as teens usually exaggerated. ).", "Maybe that's how you talk to your kids. In my house  be nice just means that. Sharing a room with siblings means this kind of thing all the time. It's life. It's not a reason to move out. \n\nYes the talking could increase. OP could also never be disturbed by it again once the 11yo starts to feel better after what she has been through. ATM it is a minor inconvenience in the grand scheme of it. Let her be grateful that it wasn't her house that burnt down and she had to stay someone unfamiliar with an unwelcoming person."]}
