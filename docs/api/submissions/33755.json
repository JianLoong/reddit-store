They divorced 3 years ago and my mom has been dating John for a year. \n\nJohn and I don\u2019t hate each other but not close. We all live in the same town as most my dad\u2019s side of the family so other than my music lesson I also hung out a lot with my cousins and didn\u2019t spend a lot of time around John.\n\nA month ago John and his daughter Trisha (11f) moved in temporarily into my house because there was a fire at theirs. My house has 2 bedrooms so Trisha has to stay in my room.\n\nMy bed is a bunk bed because I was getting a sister but my mom miscarried. Trisha and I hung out only a few times before this but I can say the same about her and John\u2014I don\u2019t hate her.\n\nBut she turns out to be hard to live with. \n\nShe has long hair and her hair is everywhere. She talks in her sleep and I was woken up 5 or 6 times since her stay. She also sometimes tried to speak to me when I already turned off my lamp, a sign that I was going to sleep.\n\nI talked to my mom and she said I needed to be nicer to her since she\u2019s been through a lot. That my issues were just minor inconveniences. That Trisha would be back at her own home soon (in late January).\n\nI talked to my dad and he said I could just move in with him until Trisha leaves.\n\nI then packed my bags and told my mom I\u2019ll be staying at dad\u2019s. She blew up at me, saying what a spoiled brat I am and that I\u2019m making John and Trisha feel horrible for imposing. I just left. It\u2019s been a week now and my mom never reached out to me. She dropped my Christmas presents at my grandma\u2019s because my dad and I would celebrate Christmas there. \n\nI don\u2019t think my mom can get the law involved because I\u2019m 15 and I just have to tell them the living situation and they should understand. Besides, it\u2019s only till I can have my room back again.

You can get your own space at your dad\u2019s so that is where you went. You just need to explain to your mom your reasons and that it\u2019s not personal, you just want to be comfortable. Trisha is probably more comfortable having YOUR room to herself for a bit as well.\n\nAll this adult shit, the divorce and dating again is super hard especially when you have kids so don\u2019t be too hard on your mom for how she reacted. It sounds like she is going through a lot and is sad about it. \n\nThis also sets a precedent that if your mom\u2019s boyfriend and Trisha were to move in down the line sharing a room is off the table which is a good thing. Putting boundaries up now I think is going to be a positive thing overall.", " NTA.  It\u2019s weird to expect 2 people to share a room when they don\u2019t know each other well.   Also your mother seems to care more about how John and his daughter are feeling than what your feelings were about the situation.   It may have been better for Trisha to have slept elsewhere in the house, like a living room, so you could have privacy when you wanted it.", "NTA for temporarily staying with your dad. You brought your concerns up with your mom and she discounted them. \n\nHowever, you could have done it in a way that didn\u2019t hurt anyone\u2019s feelings like talking to Trisha and letting her know she could have your room for several weeks, since you are both used to more privacy and like making plans to be there for dinner a night or two each week before going to your dads to sleep and for some time on Xmas.\n\nA judge is not likely to say that having a temporary roommate is sufficient reason to change the parenting plan in general but judges also give 15 year olds a lot of leeway.\n\nYou mom\u2019s feelings were probably hurt because it feels like you don\u2019t love her or want to spend time with her and she\u2019s angry because she is losing control over you, which is normal during teen years but can be hard for parents used to calling all the shots. Did she involve you in the decision-making process about whether they could move in?", "NTA. Just a moody teen. Legally, it's okay for you both to be in the room with bunk beds, and I understand not wanting to share a room at 15 with an 11yr old. Your dad should probably have had a convo with your mom if he didn't, but she does sound a bit, unreasonable. She sounds like she has a hard time seeing other people's POV. \n\nThe moody teen thing just means that 11yr old is annoying you and you don't really have the right hormones in place to have patience with her due to her age, and that's only due to your age. If you guys were blood relatives, you'd feel the same way as you do now. Do you think you'd wanna do go be with your dad if she wasn't your mom's bfs kid, but your actual sister? Probably to be honest, but also it wouldn't be a temporary situation it would be your life to share a room with someone that age.\n\n These are just things to think about, but again NTA, just moody.", "I don't see how is this a bad thing. Trisha house got burned so she had to share a room with a teen she barely know. not only this, but it seems everything she and teen just couldn't get along sleeping in the same room. \n\nSo you left to another house (which she doesn't have the privilege to do) and left her with a room for herself! so nice of you. NTA", "NTA at all. Seems pretty reasonable to me.", "NTA", "You're being selfish and self-absorbed, which is kind of teenagers' default mode. You needed to do this just before Christmas? You needed to arrange it behind your mom's back? Yes, this is not an ideal situation, and yes staying with your dad is a reasonable option, but the way you did it means YTA.", "NTA\n\nUnless your mom tries to force the blended family on you, she should understand that you don\u2019t need to stay and inconvenience yourself and lose sleep. Since John and Trisha need help, they can stay. You have the resources to be elsewhere aka your dad\u2019s so you get out. No big deal.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

On the other hand I do understand that this action will make your visitors feel unwelcome. It would've been a lot better if you had just properly talked to them and and your mom and told them it's mainly just your sleep quality. Just packing your bags can come across as passive aggressive. \n\nIf you want to be the bigger person here, go to your mom's, apologise for the way you left and make sure they know they know you're just at your dad's to sleep. Maybe even offer to take your stepsis out for some ice cream or something like that. She's probably doing worse than it seems on the surface, our house burned down when I was 9 and it's very scary, she could use a big brother atm."]}
