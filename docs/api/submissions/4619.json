My dad (55m) had an affair which resulted in a pregnancy and my mom left him over it. The woman had twin girls \"Bella\" (19f) and \"Amy\" (19f) and I deeply resented all three of them for many years. With time and therapy I was able to let go of most of my anger but I will never be close to Bell and Amy and just opted to be polite whenever I saw them or their mom. \n\nIt a tragic twist of almost laughable karma it was revealed that the woman my dad left my mom for wasn't as true to him as she led him to believe and that Bella and Amy weren't his. It got nasty and they divorced when Bella and Amy were 16. My dad agreed to still be a part of Bella and Amy's lives at the time and so opted for 50/50 custody. However, after a health scare Bella decided she wanted to find and reach out to her bio dad and while my dad wasn't happy about it Bella soothed his worries when she stated that it would only be for medical purposes as she had no desire to have him in her life.\n\nMy dad helped Bella find him and they had a meeting, and never said anything about it again. Unfortunately it was revealed that Bella lied and was still seeing her dad in secret and Amy eventually joined her. My dad wasn't happy about it and there was an argument, but when Amy brought up how it was their right to see their dad something in my dad snapped. He got quiet and told the girls that they were right and when Amy and Bella left to spend the summer with their dad and his family my dad put the house up for sale, moved all of Amy and Bella's things to a storage unit, deleted his social media, and changed this number. My dad sent a letter Bella and Amy to their mom's place explaining what he had done and that they had 30 days before he cut off all financial support (i.e. College funds, phones, etc.) saying that since their bio dad is so important that he can be their father fully. \n\nMy dad hasn't spoken to the girls since and his side of the family is on his side thinking that Bella and Amy are ungrateful and just as disrespectful as their mom. Bella and Amy have reached out to me to help them see and talk to my dad again, but I don't want to get involved nor do I even know where to find him. We just call, text, or FaceTime each other. \n\nMy father finally reached out asking if he could come spend Christmas with me, my wife, our daughter, and my wife's parents and I agreed. I'm not sure how but Bella and Amy found out and told me that they were going to over too. Not ask, but TOLD. I said No. I know that eventually my dad is going to have to have a talk with Bella and Amy but I don't want that drama at my house during my daughter's first Christmas. \n\nI told my dad about Bella and Amy and he said that he said everything he needed to in his letter and has no desire to talk to them.

It is just a huge mess and they sound like ungrateful entitled little kids, especially the part about them telling you they are coming yeah no that would not fly at my house", "Hoooo boy.\nYou\u2019re NTA\u2014but I\u2019m thinking you may want to avoid a family get together if you\u2019re not wanting a role in the next episode of this soap opera. Tell Amy and Bella that they are not invited to your home, and that if they come you\u2019ll call the police. Do that via text/email so there\u2019s a written record. You may want to uninvite your father from Xmas at your house, and have a gathering with him at a public place (and DO NOT share this location with A&B). You can tell A&B that your fathers not coming to Xmas at your house, to make them not bother, but they\u2019re unlikely to believe you.\n\nYour father, alas is a huge AH. Children are allowed to make connections with their biological family, and their social family should support them, not cut them off or limit them. Yes, your father felt betrayed, but he\u2019s the adult, A&B did NOTHING wrong in pursuing knowledge of their bio father. Cutting them off was cruel and childish. If he\u2019d been open to them finding out about their bio-father, they probably wouldn\u2019t have been so secretive and your dad could\u2019ve saved himself his feelings. He set himself up to be the victim, and now is reveling in the cruelty he\u2019s dishing out. Someone needs to tell him he\u2019s a bad person who should be ashamed of himself. That someone shouldn\u2019t be you, OP\u2014he\u2019s been enough of an AH to you.\n\nIf anyone calls you an AH, remind them that you and your mom were the first ones betrayed by your fathers bad actions, and that they should be grateful you treat any of them with grace.", "ESH except Bella and Amy", "They are going to show up\n\nJust sayin...be prepared for drama\n\nNTA", "NTA that\u2019s an awful situation and I\u2019m very sorry all of you had to be stuck in that.

My Dad isn't even your dad.  Whatever unfinished business you think you have with him is between you and him and has no place at my family Christmas celebration. Maybe talk to your mom about her penchant for destroying families if you want to have a go at somebody who deserves it.\n\nI would replace the pronouns and repeat that to all of Amy and Bella's friends and family.", "NTA. Your dad is an AH, his adopted daughters are AHs, and their mother is an AH. The daughters are partially innocent here since the mother lied about who the father was. It's natural to want to know and meet your biological father after so many years,especially for medical purposes. However, they went to spend the Summer with him. It's their right, but your father probably thought they didn't care about him since they weren't spending the Summer or part of it with him. I do think your father went too far with absolutely no contact. The sisters are AHs for saying they will show up to your house when they're not invited. Plan on them showing up.", "NTA.

Is there any way you can change the venue? \n\nNot related to judgement - I had to laugh at your dad\u2019s karmic justice. BUT I also will say he\u2019s being a dick to them about it. I get that he\u2019s hurt, but they have a right to find their bio dad and they shouldn\u2019t be punished for it. What he did was stone cold.", "NTA- regardless of what\u2019s gone down with everyone else, you are doing what is right for you, your wife and daughter.

Ignore them, their mother was the first asshole for lying and then they became assholes for sneaking and lying to your dad. That's his issue to deal with and if he said he's done then he's done. Don't' get involved. And don't' let them in your house.", "NTA - None of this should be your problem. Stick to your boundaries.

That was very wrong of him, given that he was the only father you had ever known. But that's between you and him. It has nothing to do with me. So no, you cannot use *my* Christmas celebration to try to force him to reconcile with you. And the fact you have enlisted your family members to pressure me makes me even *less* interested in being involved.\"\n\nNTA. As far as I can tell, the biggest AH here is your father (what kind of person refuses to *talk* to the daughters he raised just because they--quite reasonably--want to have a relationship with their biological parent??? I can't get over his cruelty), followed by your family members who are supporting/encouraging him in his cruelty. \n\nBella and Amy are AHs to try to force you to be in the middle, but they are young and desperate to talk to their dad... Their behavior is understandable, just inappropriate", "Your dad just sounds awful.", "NTA\n\nThey aren't your sister's, at best, they are step-sisters. You have no obligation to them, as you've never been close. Their relationship with your father isn't any of your business.\n\nMake sure they understand if they come to your house, you will call the police and have them removed. If they show up, do not open the door and call the cops. Tell them they are trespassing and you want them removed.\n\n\nNot your circus and not your monkeys.\n\nEdit - removed a sentence, as I didn't want to put blame on the twins. Yes, they withheld their relationship with bio-dad, but it likely was to spare the fathers feelings.\n\nThe dad is the asshole.", "NTA.

First let me start by saying NTA.\n\nThe only reason why Bella and Amy want to talk to your dad now is because he cut them off.  They need to spend Xmas with their dad and be happy.  How dare they just invite them over to your home.  \n\nPlease also tell them if they show up they will be met by the police because this is not your monkey and not your show.", "A huge mess that has nothing to do with you. I'm honestly impressed that you're letting your father come for Christmas. They need to work through whatever they want to work through without involving you.  NTA", "NTA\n\nMan, that is a really tough situation. Unfortunately, your dad is going to have to sort through it himself. I don't think he should have moved and cut all support. He raised them as his own for 16 years and that should have meant he was bonded to them even if he wasn't their blood father. He has to know that most adopted kids want to have a relationship with their bio parents as well if it is possible. I know that wasn't the exact situation, and that's where his hurt came from, but unfortunately that's more what it will be like for the twins. It's natural to want to know who you share blood with, especially at that age. I understand his hurt was about his wife and it was all bundled in together so he made big decisions. Now he has to deal with them. \n\nBut your post isn't about him or the twins. It's about your decision. I agree that this is not your circus, not your monkeys. Your dad and the twins have to make things right, but you don't have to have it hosted at your house if you don't want to.

Your Christmas, that you are hosting, isn't for them to decide to confront or reconcile with your father, it is for your family- the one's you choose- to be together and have fun. \n\nIt isn't your job to facilitate any relationships. You have asked your father to come for Christmas, and these two ladies are not invited, the end.

So for the record:\n\n* Yes, it is\n* That the twins sought a relationship with their bio dad doesn't change that; if you think familial love is some finite resource you have a really possessive and creepy concept of love/parenthood\n* The *method* by which he abandoned his children \u2014 the deception, ghosting, selling the house \u2014 is just deeply creepy, and a degree of volatility I would not want my own children exposed to\n* Between the guy's priorities and his *Banshees of Inisherin*-tier manic way of expressing them, I think he's a bit of an unreliable narrator as to what his interactions with his daughters were like, what \"disrespect\" they showed him, and any other reasons their relationship might be fraught\n\nThe situation is fresh and volatile, maybe it'll settle into something less insane.

He's not some sympathetic character. But Bella and Amy were adults, knew their \"dad\" wasn't in a good place, and hurt him anyway.\n\nThey had the right to find their bio dad and have a relationship with him, but they knew that it could hurt their relationship with the man who raised them.

And as cruel as it was for their mom to use OP's dad and lie to him for so long, he did make choices that helped bring this situation about (cheating on his first wife, not verifying paternity, etc) whereas his daughters had absolutely no part in bringing about this twisted family tree; they were born into it and just wanted to know their biological father without having to lie about it.\n\nThat said, threatening to show up at their legal-half-sibling's home on Christmas for the big confrontation they want to have is not okay.\n\nOP, you have my sympathy for this situation.

He should have approached this in a different way prior to the argument and sorted out his feelings without their involvement.\n\nHowever, based on the information posted by the OP, it seems like they did choose bio dad as their dad.  In an argument, Amy called bio dad their dad.  That language implicitly rejects or denigrates his role, in that simply by virtue of biology, bio dad is placed in a similar position or of greater stature than OP's father.  According to OP, that is when he snapped.  It is apparent that he took that as their rejection of him as father, even if it was likely said in the heat of the moment.   There is no black and white thinking here.  But just as you claim others are chastising the twins for having emotions, you are denying him reasonable emotions to have.  He isn't a robot either.  And he apparently took their rejection of him to cut off all contact.  Was that spite, or was it to protect himself? What Amy said is pretty damaging.

Getting to know your bio parents is NOT a betrayal and acting to prevent your kids from connecting to bio family is gross. \n\nSure you can set a boundary that you\u2019ll disown your adult kid for any number of reasons; talking to someone you don\u2019t want them to, having sex before marriage, being a different religion. It\u2019s all ALLOWED but it\u2019s pretty damn assholish. And if your kids sense you are an asshole like that, you can expect them to lie to you. Why? Because despite having complicated relationships with assholish parents, most children don\u2019t want to be straight up abandoned and are not glad when they are. At the same time they still attempt to spread their wings as they age and figure things out for themselves, which is also normal.", "No, the girls - who are adults - can't have their cake and eat it too. Respect the dad as their dad, or have him no longer treat them as their dad. Simple enough.", "A summer with the bio-dad is a pretty long time.  A summer without, apparently, any contact with ATM-dad.", "It bothers me that OP villianizes the sister's so much but seems to give dad a free pass.", "They decided to spend two months with a parent their mother kept from them by lying to them for years, and their punishment was that their father systematically dismantled their entire lives and safety nets, and disappeared with no way to contact him. That\u2019s horrifying for them.", "Also they are legal adults now. Not really abandoning. He has no legal responsibilities to them anymore.", "He went bc when they were teenagers that apparently betrayed him by wanting to know their bio dad . Yeah his disappearing like a ghost with only a letter screams amazing dad", "So now them knowing their bio dad is backstabbing ? Are you hearing yourself ?", "They were children.", "All im hearing in my head now is \u201chellooooo? no more monkeys jumping on the bed\u201d in the creepy animation styles kid\u2019s YouTube channels seem to all use now. Only one I like is super simple songs lol", "Is it tho? I bet they were afraid of his reaction which was probably justifiable given how he actually reacted.   \n\n\nOP is NTA but like the dad is a whole another story.", "I feel that the fact they needed to lie to OP's dad about meeting their bio dad is disturbing. They were entitled to build a separate relationship with their bio dad without it being interpreted as abandonment of their non-bio dad. \n\nNon-bio dad obviously put a huge condition on their future relationship, and he followed through on cutting them off as soon as he found out.", "Yeah, cause they lied about it.", "Hum no because he is an ah. 16 year old lie if every parents had those levels of reactions e wouldn\u2019t survive", "But why did they HAVE to lie about it? Why was he telling them they couldn't have a relationship with both him and their bio dad?", "It seems like everybody can act on their feelings except the dad since he cheated that one time. Not wanting to have a relationship with ungrateful children he helped to raise who are NOT biologically his shouldn\u2019t be any man\u2019s choice. A man\u2019s only job is to provide financially and he cannot just stop doing that.", "You are seeing it as black and white. He signed up to be their dad, he has to be their dad no matter what. Period.\n\n\nBut he is an old man, fully spent. He destroyed the life he built for good ~35 yrs to be these kids dad. He rebuilt his life around these girls. He probably imagined walking them down the aisle, playing with their kids, and now he is almost at the end of his journey and these girls are saying he is not their dad anymore. Not the main dad, but may be a secondary one.\n\n\nHis entire life of 55 yrs came crashing when the girls said that. What's the point of his life anymore? Just play second fiddle and hope these girls will show him some love after whatever is left from drooling over their bio dad? After they spend their summers, Thanksgiving and Christmas with their bio dad, may be they would spend 1 cold winter day in a year with him? That's all he can look forward in his life?\n\n\nHe just resigned from life, there is nothing more in his life to look forward too. That's why its extreme reaction. They are 19, have full life ahead. He is 55, his life is over.", "I feel bad for the twins. When this flight eventually lands, baggage claim will be a hell of mess to sort out, not to mention very painful for both of them.\n\nThey've literally done nothing wrong, yet their world burns down around them.\n\nNTA but this situation really sucks. You can't write this, but authors try.", "Everything else aside the question OP asked was if they were the AH for telling them they were not allowed to show up and to keep their drama out of OP\u2019s house and holiday celebration. My vote on that is a resounding NTA.", "You are NTA for not wanting to be involved in this drama at your house at Christmas. But you have to realize your Dad is the AH. He is the dad those girls knew all their lives. They were just as blindsided as he was by the truth. They have the right to be curious and even want a relationship. Your Dad abandoned them because of ego", "OP is a guy.", "> Or, perhaps, they could ask their bio-parents to support them financially at this point. It seems only fair to me that those two people should finally step up to the plate.\n\nYeah, their bio-dad got out of 18 years of child support. Time to put that money to use.", "I get what you\u2019re saying, but it\u2019s not exactly like they didn\u2019t have a father figure growing up. It would be different if they spent their entire lives with a single mom. They could have done things in a way that respected the man who raised them and continued to take care of them even after the (karmic) betrayal was exposed. He still maintained the financial burden of raising them, I can understand why their actions would cause him to withdraw his financial support. Even though the emotional ghosting is quite harsh lol", "My bad, doesn't change my point.", "There is a lot of distance between amazing and not bad.\n\nWhy shouldn\u2019t he feel betrayed they said they wouldn\u2019t and then they did. He gets to feel however he feels. They are two adult women if they don\u2019t want to live by his rules he has every right to kick them out of his house.", "No one is arguing it\u2019s OP\u2019s problem. Most of the comments refer to comments justifying the father\u2019s behavior.", "I would venture to guess that he used it to set up a fresh start.", "You're point is great. I just figured you wouldn't want to misgender someone.", "Sounds like he bought a camper and is living the free life. I\u2019ve heard some guys after divorce or relationship breakdowns with their kids often go on a solitary journey and just keep brief contact with their closest contacts but other than that enjoy the peace and quiet of nature.", "You know, that's a good point.", "NTA\n\nNothing ruins a celebration more than the police showing up.  Bella and Amy are very rude for just inviting themselves over and that is something that you need to be prepared for.  They are not going to take no for an answer and this is going to get nasty before it ends.\n\nThe worse part of it all, is that they are trying to drag you into the middle of their squabble with your father and that is a no go.\n\nYou also may want to shift the celebration to another location that way you, your wife and your child will not be there when they show up and no one is at home, where you can still have a nice time celebrating and not worrying about uninvited guests trying to crash or have drama in your house.  \n\nRing camera may be a good investment for your home.  \n\nBut after that, you and your father really do need to talk, for it is not right that you or your family are getting dragged into the middle of this and it should not impact if your father is trying to establish or improve his relationship with you and your family.\n\nI think you may want to cut contact with them for a while or grey rock and go vague fully.  Though it also leads to the question about how did they find out about such in the first place.", "Nta, they aren't even your real sisters, they are former step sisters since it came out they aren't your dad's.\n\nYou owe them nothing, tell them if they show up you will call the cops for trespassing. Should scare them enough to not show up.\n\nEdit to add, if your dad hasn't already he should contest the birth certificates for the girls and make the bio be added since he knows who it is he has a decent chance of getting a judge to agree with him.", "NTA. The entire situation sucks. Bella and Amy should have realized how it would affect your dad when they decided spending the summer with their bio dad was a good idea. It is now up to them to convince your dad to see them again, if he chooses to do that. They should not force themselves on your Christmas celebration and you should not let them force themselves in.", "NTA but I really hope we get an update, this is soap level crap that I need more of.", "So the dad cheats,  essentially abandoning his daughter.   His affair partner lies, so his non-daughters abandon him.  He disowned the kids he never owned  abandoning them.  And people get mad at OP.  Screw them, nta.", "NTA Your dad got chumped by a liar, and now he sees himself chumped by another liar. They need to stay away if they ever hope to have any kind of relationship sometime in the future.  It's too raw for Dad. They're too selfish to see it, and you need to set boundaries... Let them know there will be consequences if they show up to ruin your holiday. This is your family time. Not your problem.", "Curious, sure. But they lied about keeping in contact with him and then fucked off to spend a whole summer with him. OP's dad is basically reaping what he sowed, but I can understand why he did what he did.", "Small wonder that the twins have behaved as dishonestly and manipulatively as they have.", "They were teenagers. He was their father their entire lives, then cut them off because they wanted to get to know their other parent. They\u2019re not managing things well right now, but given the complex situation they were in, I can\u2019t say that a couple of children were wrong for spending the summer with a parent they\u2019d never had a chance to know because their mom deceived them.", "Maybe it happened multiple times, and this was his tipping point? He was probably already angry that the bio dad had enjoyed being free from supporting his children, and now after finding out these girls just skipped off to spend time and have fun with the bio dad leaving behind OP's dad feeling like a loser for spending all this time raising them. At that point, what else is he supposed to feel? Yeah he overreacted, and shouldn't have gone to that length, but different people have different levels of tolerance and different responses to bad situations, and I don't judge him for having that.  \nHe's still an AH for cheating on OP's mom. But not really the AH for this. Blame the mother for cheating on him with the bio dad.", "I think cuckholding is abuse.", "This. I think it\u2019s more about their losing their college funds and financial support from nonbiological dad than wanting to continue a relationship with him.", "I mean, personally, no, I wouldn't. I'd lose a parent, not gain one. But each person is different.", "Not true. People survive/get past infidelity all the time, and in this case, he was led to believe that two tiny baby girls that HE helped bring into the world would be horribly impacted without a father. It's big. To find out that that was a lie? And that those girls were calling the other man their \"real\" dad? I can understand how stunning and heartbreaking that must have been.", ">There\u2019s not a limited amount of love in a family.\n\nThat is only relevant if OP's dad wants to be their family. He doesn't want to be their family.", "I don\u2019t disagree, but mom did that.  Not the kids.  There\u2019s a much better way that non-dad could have handled this.", "Yes but it needs to be something that he can\u2019t sell and give all to his stepkids. If they want a relationship with him , they should when he is ready. However if they are rushing back to him just for his money , the money should be in a form that he can\u2019t just give it to them , ie he spent it on vacations or gifts to charity.", "[deleted]", "\u2026i didn\u2019t? I was making a point that it\u2019s not like she said \u201cyou\u2019re not my real dad\u201d or anything like that. I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s what you meant cuz I don\u2019t even really know what you\u2019re getting at. Oh well.", "For the same reason op is still talking to his ah dad. Y\u2019all love to act like dna doesn\u2019t mean shit when most of our societies are built around that", "You've set up a moral framework in which the daughters owe absolutely nothing to the man that raised them despite not being their biological father while he simultaneously owes them ... anything at all. Which he doesn't. He literally owes them nothing. If he had chosen to leave when he found out the truth that would 100% be morally acceptable.", "If either of my parents sent me a dear-John letter and sold their home and cutoff all ways for me to contact them, and then I found out where they were going to be during the holidays, I\u2019d probably do the same thing and show up. I\u2019d be desperate to talk to my parent and wouldn\u2019t give a fuck about the holiday. I feel for these kids who are basically mourning their relationship with their dad.", "Bruh... maybe bio dad did not know they were his because mom had a guy on the hook already. However, being shaken should not end love he supposedly had for them. Dude is an AH, the girls just wanted to know their bio family, as they should have. OP is NTA.", ">He was already shaken by finding out that they weren't biologically his. He needed love and reassurance at that time. \n\n\nAnd how do you think the 16yo girls felt finding out that the man that raised them wasn't their father? Or when he completely abandoned them for also wanting a relationship with their biological father?\n\n>they abandoned their dad, who left his family and blew up his existing family for their sake and raised them\n\nHe blew up his family by having an affair, not for their sake.", "If bio dad is so \"decent\" then he can step up to the plate and start paying for their college, phones, etc.", "Especially given his specific anxieties about this, it makes sense that he would have a strong reaction. This is still extreme, and he's definitely TA, but so are they.", ">Exactly! I don't understand redit users' obsession supporting men raising and paying for another man children. Darn, even if I always believed they were mine and still love them, I can cut support (in any way and form) the moment I want when they are adults. That's my right as an adult and no one can contest me about it. If anyone doesn't like it, they can bite their own elbows and GFT. This is for your redit users who like to abuse men good faith.", "Bingo!", "Children actions obviously affect parents and they shouldn\u2019t be rude to their parents either. But this was a reasonable request and instead of just saying he\u2019s uncomfortable and leaving it at that, he got into an argument about it\u2026. Then got mad at the result of his previous tantrum and threw another one."]}
