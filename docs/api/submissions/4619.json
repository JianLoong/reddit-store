My dad (55m) had an affair which resulted in a pregnancy and my mom left him over it. The woman had twin girls \"Bella\" (19f) and \"Amy\" (19f) and I deeply resented all three of them for many years. With time and therapy I was able to let go of most of my anger but I will never be close to Bell and Amy and just opted to be polite whenever I saw them or their mom. \n\nIt a tragic twist of almost laughable karma it was revealed that the woman my dad left my mom for wasn't as true to him as she led him to believe and that Bella and Amy weren't his. It got nasty and they divorced when Bella and Amy were 16. My dad agreed to still be a part of Bella and Amy's lives at the time and so opted for 50/50 custody. However, after a health scare Bella decided she wanted to find and reach out to her bio dad and while my dad wasn't happy about it Bella soothed his worries when she stated that it would only be for medical purposes as she had no desire to have him in her life.\n\nMy dad helped Bella find him and they had a meeting, and never said anything about it again. Unfortunately it was revealed that Bella lied and was still seeing her dad in secret and Amy eventually joined her. My dad wasn't happy about it and there was an argument, but when Amy brought up how it was their right to see their dad something in my dad snapped. He got quiet and told the girls that they were right and when Amy and Bella left to spend the summer with their dad and his family my dad put the house up for sale, moved all of Amy and Bella's things to a storage unit, deleted his social media, and changed this number. My dad sent a letter Bella and Amy to their mom's place explaining what he had done and that they had 30 days before he cut off all financial support (i.e. College funds, phones, etc.) saying that since their bio dad is so important that he can be their father fully. \n\nMy dad hasn't spoken to the girls since and his side of the family is on his side thinking that Bella and Amy are ungrateful and just as disrespectful as their mom. Bella and Amy have reached out to me to help them see and talk to my dad again, but I don't want to get involved nor do I even know where to find him. We just call, text, or FaceTime each other. \n\nMy father finally reached out asking if he could come spend Christmas with me, my wife, our daughter, and my wife's parents and I agreed. I'm not sure how but Bella and Amy found out and told me that they were going to over too. Not ask, but TOLD. I said No. I know that eventually my dad is going to have to have a talk with Bella and Amy but I don't want that drama at my house during my daughter's first Christmas. \n\nI told my dad about Bella and Amy and he said that he said everything he needed to in his letter and has no desire to talk to them.

It is just a huge mess and they sound like ungrateful entitled little kids, especially the part about them telling you they are coming yeah no that would not fly at my house", "Hoooo boy.\nYou\u2019re NTA\u2014but I\u2019m thinking you may want to avoid a family get together if you\u2019re not wanting a role in the next episode of this soap opera. Tell Amy and Bella that they are not invited to your home, and that if they come you\u2019ll call the police. Do that via text/email so there\u2019s a written record. You may want to uninvite your father from Xmas at your house, and have a gathering with him at a public place (and DO NOT share this location with A&B). You can tell A&B that your fathers not coming to Xmas at your house, to make them not bother, but they\u2019re unlikely to believe you.\n\nYour father, alas is a huge AH. Children are allowed to make connections with their biological family, and their social family should support them, not cut them off or limit them. Yes, your father felt betrayed, but he\u2019s the adult, A&B did NOTHING wrong in pursuing knowledge of their bio father. Cutting them off was cruel and childish. If he\u2019d been open to them finding out about their bio-father, they probably wouldn\u2019t have been so secretive and your dad could\u2019ve saved himself his feelings. He set himself up to be the victim, and now is reveling in the cruelty he\u2019s dishing out. Someone needs to tell him he\u2019s a bad person who should be ashamed of himself. That someone shouldn\u2019t be you, OP\u2014he\u2019s been enough of an AH to you.\n\nIf anyone calls you an AH, remind them that you and your mom were the first ones betrayed by your fathers bad actions, and that they should be grateful you treat any of them with grace.", "ESH except Bella and Amy", "They are going to show up\n\nJust sayin...be prepared for drama\n\nNTA", "NTA that\u2019s an awful situation and I\u2019m very sorry all of you had to be stuck in that.

My Dad isn't even your dad.  Whatever unfinished business you think you have with him is between you and him and has no place at my family Christmas celebration. Maybe talk to your mom about her penchant for destroying families if you want to have a go at somebody who deserves it.\n\nI would replace the pronouns and repeat that to all of Amy and Bella's friends and family.", "NTA. Your dad is an AH, his adopted daughters are AHs, and their mother is an AH. The daughters are partially innocent here since the mother lied about who the father was. It's natural to want to know and meet your biological father after so many years,especially for medical purposes. However, they went to spend the Summer with him. It's their right, but your father probably thought they didn't care about him since they weren't spending the Summer or part of it with him. I do think your father went too far with absolutely no contact. The sisters are AHs for saying they will show up to your house when they're not invited. Plan on them showing up.", "NTA.

Is there any way you can change the venue? \n\nNot related to judgement - I had to laugh at your dad\u2019s karmic justice. BUT I also will say he\u2019s being a dick to them about it. I get that he\u2019s hurt, but they have a right to find their bio dad and they shouldn\u2019t be punished for it. What he did was stone cold.", "NTA- regardless of what\u2019s gone down with everyone else, you are doing what is right for you, your wife and daughter.

Ignore them, their mother was the first asshole for lying and then they became assholes for sneaking and lying to your dad. That's his issue to deal with and if he said he's done then he's done. Don't' get involved. And don't' let them in your house.", "NTA - None of this should be your problem. Stick to your boundaries.

That was very wrong of him, given that he was the only father you had ever known. But that's between you and him. It has nothing to do with me. So no, you cannot use *my* Christmas celebration to try to force him to reconcile with you. And the fact you have enlisted your family members to pressure me makes me even *less* interested in being involved.\"\n\nNTA. As far as I can tell, the biggest AH here is your father (what kind of person refuses to *talk* to the daughters he raised just because they--quite reasonably--want to have a relationship with their biological parent??? I can't get over his cruelty), followed by your family members who are supporting/encouraging him in his cruelty. \n\nBella and Amy are AHs to try to force you to be in the middle, but they are young and desperate to talk to their dad... Their behavior is understandable, just inappropriate", "Your dad just sounds awful.", "NTA\n\nThey aren't your sister's, at best, they are step-sisters. You have no obligation to them, as you've never been close. Their relationship with your father isn't any of your business.\n\nMake sure they understand if they come to your house, you will call the police and have them removed. If they show up, do not open the door and call the cops. Tell them they are trespassing and you want them removed.\n\n\nNot your circus and not your monkeys.\n\nEdit - removed a sentence, as I didn't want to put blame on the twins. Yes, they withheld their relationship with bio-dad, but it likely was to spare the fathers feelings.\n\nThe dad is the asshole.", "NTA.

First let me start by saying NTA.\n\nThe only reason why Bella and Amy want to talk to your dad now is because he cut them off.  They need to spend Xmas with their dad and be happy.  How dare they just invite them over to your home.  \n\nPlease also tell them if they show up they will be met by the police because this is not your monkey and not your show.", "A huge mess that has nothing to do with you. I'm honestly impressed that you're letting your father come for Christmas. They need to work through whatever they want to work through without involving you.  NTA", "NTA\n\nMan, that is a really tough situation. Unfortunately, your dad is going to have to sort through it himself. I don't think he should have moved and cut all support. He raised them as his own for 16 years and that should have meant he was bonded to them even if he wasn't their blood father. He has to know that most adopted kids want to have a relationship with their bio parents as well if it is possible. I know that wasn't the exact situation, and that's where his hurt came from, but unfortunately that's more what it will be like for the twins. It's natural to want to know who you share blood with, especially at that age. I understand his hurt was about his wife and it was all bundled in together so he made big decisions. Now he has to deal with them. \n\nBut your post isn't about him or the twins. It's about your decision. I agree that this is not your circus, not your monkeys. Your dad and the twins have to make things right, but you don't have to have it hosted at your house if you don't want to.

Your Christmas, that you are hosting, isn't for them to decide to confront or reconcile with your father, it is for your family- the one's you choose- to be together and have fun. \n\nIt isn't your job to facilitate any relationships. You have asked your father to come for Christmas, and these two ladies are not invited, the end.

That being said, minute they threw out the \u201cbio dad is our dad!\u201d card, they really shouldn\u2019t have been surprised on the outcome. OP\u2019s dad was lied to continuously and he had had enough. All of this is somewhat karmic and satisfying that a cheater gets his due and from what I get the feeling from this story (since OP has maintained a relationship with his pops) he\u2019s aware of his mistakes and wants to start his amends tour. And he wants nothing to do anymore with his ex wife and now ex kids. \n\nI am not excusing the dad at all here. I\u2019m just saying that the twins should\u2019ve really thought this through before burning all kinds of bridges with the man that raised them and kept custody of them regardless of blood. \n\nBtw OP: NTA.", ">So many opportunities here to connect and get to know a whole other part of them. Such an opportunity to get to understand them better and build a stronger bond. To have someone to tell the stories of them growing up and what is like having the privilege to raise such great women. Your dad did that. People are so short sighted it hurts. So much could have come out of the connection they made. And instead they are being punished just for wanting to get to know someone who is half a part of them.\n\nWhy would/should a man want to connect with his ex-wife's AP?", "You sound so sanctimonious it\u2019s utterly absurd.

He's not some sympathetic character. But Bella and Amy were adults, knew their \"dad\" wasn't in a good place, and hurt him anyway.\n\nThey had the right to find their bio dad and have a relationship with him, but they knew that it could hurt their relationship with the man who raised them. He raised them for 16 years then stuck around after finding out they weren't his. Regardless of whatever else happened that's admirable. If what he needed in that moment was for his daughters to say he was enough for them I can't blame him for that. It's unfortunate, but this whole story is unfortunate.", "The thing that concerns me is their behavior regarding their \"brother\" and the Christmas.  They didn't call and ask him if they could come to Christmas, they told him they were coming.  This type of behavior indicates they aren't entirely innocent either. \n\nFurther, OP's Dad ultimately respected their wishes.  They wanted a relationship with their bio-dad, regardless of how it hurt OP's dad and at what sounds at the expense of one with OP's dad (given that they apparently spent an entire summer with bio-dad).  They should also respect his wishes to step back, regardless of how it hurts them.  \n\nIt does suck for the twins, because it's not wrong per se to want to get to know their bio-dad and spend time with him, but they went about it all wrong by lying about it.", "Yeah, the dad is a major AH. 1. Had an affair. Left first wife. 2. Decided to stay in the twins lives, but gate-kept whether they can have a relationship with bio-dad 3.

It shows a clear lack of respect with how many boundaries they\u2019re willing to cross.\n\nI do see how they may have felt like they needed to hide things from OP\u2019s father, given his reaction. At the same time, they did dip out on him for a summer, knowing how much their actions would be hurting him.. this man who, however terrible of an individual, still continued to support them after learning they were not his.\n\nAnd I just want to add in the fact that there are plenty of bio parents who did not hesitate to drop their own kids once they hit 18, yet he continued to house them and financially support them even after. I can understand why he may have felt them leaving like that was a slap in the face.\n\nAnd their time away was apparently long enough for him to have moved everything out and sell the damn house?? I mean, unless the father sold his house for cheaps or straight easy cash, selling a house will usually take quite a bit of time.\n\nI\u2019m not calling them an asshole for wanting to have a relationship with their bio-dad or even lying about it. But the twins dipping out the way that they did and not trying to at least resolve things before leaving for so long makes me wonder how much this father even means to them.\n\nThey\u2019re also still wrong for trying to bring this all to someone else\u2019s Christmas get-together, especially considering the fact that they don\u2019t actually have any connections with anyone there.. hell, this might even be the first time they actually meet OP\u2019s wife and in-laws.

I imagine that had to hurt.\n\nDad's paying the bills for kids that are not biologically his, and they ghost him for long enough for him to sell his house and move their stuff into storage!?

He raised them. \n\nMy actual mom isn't blood related to me either.", "He cut them off when they told him that it's their right to see their DAD, i.e. Dad is not him.

But also I think universal peace of enhanced individuals might be easier than solving this family problem.", "People are just glossing over that they called the bio dad, who they just met recently, DAD to the actual dad's face in an argument.  They told him that they don't see him as Dad and that's when he cut them off.", "So in defence of them lying, when he found out he completely up rooted their lives and disappeared with nothing but a letter.

They clearly believe he is.\n\nYour rigid belief that someone can only have one dad is not applicable to anyone else's life.", "The daughters aren't AH for wanting to meet bio dad.  They are AHs for lying to him about it.  Parent/Child relationships are not just one way, which is what you are treating it as, particularly as the children enter adulthood.  He also has the right to have feelings and they are old enough to discuss that with him, even if they disagree.  Instead, during their last argument, they called the guy that they barely knew \"their dad\" to his face, which denigrates and/or denies his role as their father.  OP's father is the AH, and he did not handle this bio dad situation the right way.  But they told him how they viewed him at the end.  Adult children do not get a pass for treating their parents like crap.  And that's what they did during that final argument.  He has the right to protect himself too, even if he isn't a good person.", "And doesn't OP's dad deserve to have peace now? He probably feels like he wasted multiple years, if he knew he was scammed into fatherhood, he might have not spend so many years with them and considering they spent entire summer with their bio dad without giving a shit what he went through just shows how little they care about him.", "He helped them for 3 years after finding out. He is abandoning them 3 years later, now when they are 19, not 16, it's fairly obvious only reason they care is to get access to their college funds.", "it doesn't say anywhere that he made them promise but that they did so on their own, he is most likely feeling betrayed due to the fact that they lied when he helped find their bio dad in the first place", "OP's dad 100% has the right to not want to deal with them. You have no idea how terrifying for any men thought of them raising other persons children is. Considering they spent entire summer with their bio dad and his family he 100% has right to cut them out especially financially. \n\nIn the end they showed them that they value biology more than what he did for them, so why shouldn't he do the same.", "it's probably not about ego and more so about the fact that they lied. he came around and helped them find the bio dad so it's kinda weird that they felt the need to lie ab it rather than have an honest convo", "I feel like it would be different of they were just spending time with him, but going for the whole summer could definitely feel like abandonment to OP's dad.\n\nI don't know if I'd do anything differently than anyone in this post so my only judgment is that op is NTA, but I can see how everyone could feel hurt by everyone else's behavior", "One of biggest fears men have is that they raise someone else's child and waste their time like this, OP's dad is better than most, because at first he stuck around, but a lot of women don't get it and lack empathy when men try to talk about this.\n\nHe doesn't need to be the bigger person when they betrayed him and spent entire summer with their bio dad.", "This is one statement I can definitely agree with.  They had awful role models", "It is their right, but this is not \"Do I have the right\" reddit sub, now is it?\n\nWe are going to have to agree to disagree as to what they told him.  I'm basing my assessment on OP's actual language used and context.  What those girls believe now (or even then but said something different in anger) is irrelevant considering what they told OP's father during a heated argument.\n\nI have no \"rigid belief\" that someone can only have one dad.  That's your own completely made-up bullshit. It's not even supportable based upon what I said.  I have no desire to respond further your bad faith nonsense.", "No.  That's not what happened.\n\nWhat happened was that Amy said it was their right to see \"their dad\" during a heated argument.  Then dad agreed that it was \"their right\" to do so.\n\nHe snapped because they called the other guy \"their dad\" to his face when he raised them.\n\nHe didn't lie to their faces. That's not a reasonable interpretation of what was said here.", "In what callous world do you think the only reason they care that their father figure abandoned them is to get access to their college funds?", "He absolutely has the RIGHT to not deal with them, but when the whole thing blew up he made a decision to stay as their father.  HE made that choice, not them.Expecting them to never want to know their bio dad was unrealistic and set everyone up for failure.  While I understand his feelings, he as the adult holds more fault, not the children.  (Well and his wife obviously.)\n\nETA - I'm not exactly calling the dad an AH, I get he's hurt.  I'm saying that portraying the twins as having betrayed him twice isn't fair.  They were kids and this shattered their world too.", "Yeah they have his communication skills because he raised them. Sounds like they are communicating the way their father(the one that raised them) does.", "And op's dad feeling don't count here, or what? You sound like someone who think men should just swallow their feelings. He was scammed into fatherhood by his ex-wife and probably feels like he wasted 19 years of his life, he has every right to want peace now, especially since they value their bio dad so much, that they left to spend entire summer with him and his family.\n\nIf they can value biology so much, why can't he start doing it too."]}
