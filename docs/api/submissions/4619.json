My dad (55m) had an affair which resulted in a pregnancy and my mom left him over it. The woman had twin girls \"Bella\" (19f) and \"Amy\" (19f) and I deeply resented all three of them for many years. With time and therapy I was able to let go of most of my anger but I will never be close to Bell and Amy and just opted to be polite whenever I saw them or their mom. \n\nIt a tragic twist of almost laughable karma it was revealed that the woman my dad left my mom for wasn't as true to him as she led him to believe and that Bella and Amy weren't his. It got nasty and they divorced when Bella and Amy were 16. My dad agreed to still be a part of Bella and Amy's lives at the time and so opted for 50/50 custody. However, after a health scare Bella decided she wanted to find and reach out to her bio dad and while my dad wasn't happy about it Bella soothed his worries when she stated that it would only be for medical purposes as she had no desire to have him in her life.\n\nMy dad helped Bella find him and they had a meeting, and never said anything about it again. Unfortunately it was revealed that Bella lied and was still seeing her dad in secret and Amy eventually joined her. My dad wasn't happy about it and there was an argument, but when Amy brought up how it was their right to see their dad something in my dad snapped. He got quiet and told the girls that they were right and when Amy and Bella left to spend the summer with their dad and his family my dad put the house up for sale, moved all of Amy and Bella's things to a storage unit, deleted his social media, and changed this number. My dad sent a letter Bella and Amy to their mom's place explaining what he had done and that they had 30 days before he cut off all financial support (i.e. College funds, phones, etc.) saying that since their bio dad is so important that he can be their father fully. \n\nMy dad hasn't spoken to the girls since and his side of the family is on his side thinking that Bella and Amy are ungrateful and just as disrespectful as their mom. Bella and Amy have reached out to me to help them see and talk to my dad again, but I don't want to get involved nor do I even know where to find him. We just call, text, or FaceTime each other. \n\nMy father finally reached out asking if he could come spend Christmas with me, my wife, our daughter, and my wife's parents and I agreed. I'm not sure how but Bella and Amy found out and told me that they were going to over too. Not ask, but TOLD. I said No. I know that eventually my dad is going to have to have a talk with Bella and Amy but I don't want that drama at my house during my daughter's first Christmas. \n\nI told my dad about Bella and Amy and he said that he said everything he needed to in his letter and has no desire to talk to them.

It is just a huge mess and they sound like ungrateful entitled little kids, especially the part about them telling you they are coming yeah no that would not fly at my house", "Hoooo boy.\nYou\u2019re NTA\u2014but I\u2019m thinking you may want to avoid a family get together if you\u2019re not wanting a role in the next episode of this soap opera. Tell Amy and Bella that they are not invited to your home, and that if they come you\u2019ll call the police. Do that via text/email so there\u2019s a written record. You may want to uninvite your father from Xmas at your house, and have a gathering with him at a public place (and DO NOT share this location with A&B). You can tell A&B that your fathers not coming to Xmas at your house, to make them not bother, but they\u2019re unlikely to believe you.\n\nYour father, alas is a huge AH. Children are allowed to make connections with their biological family, and their social family should support them, not cut them off or limit them. Yes, your father felt betrayed, but he\u2019s the adult, A&B did NOTHING wrong in pursuing knowledge of their bio father. Cutting them off was cruel and childish. If he\u2019d been open to them finding out about their bio-father, they probably wouldn\u2019t have been so secretive and your dad could\u2019ve saved himself his feelings. He set himself up to be the victim, and now is reveling in the cruelty he\u2019s dishing out. Someone needs to tell him he\u2019s a bad person who should be ashamed of himself. That someone shouldn\u2019t be you, OP\u2014he\u2019s been enough of an AH to you.\n\nIf anyone calls you an AH, remind them that you and your mom were the first ones betrayed by your fathers bad actions, and that they should be grateful you treat any of them with grace.", "ESH except Bella and Amy", "They are going to show up\n\nJust sayin...be prepared for drama\n\nNTA", "NTA that\u2019s an awful situation and I\u2019m very sorry all of you had to be stuck in that.

My Dad isn't even your dad.  Whatever unfinished business you think you have with him is between you and him and has no place at my family Christmas celebration. Maybe talk to your mom about her penchant for destroying families if you want to have a go at somebody who deserves it.\n\nI would replace the pronouns and repeat that to all of Amy and Bella's friends and family.", "NTA. Your dad is an AH, his adopted daughters are AHs, and their mother is an AH. The daughters are partially innocent here since the mother lied about who the father was. It's natural to want to know and meet your biological father after so many years,especially for medical purposes. However, they went to spend the Summer with him. It's their right, but your father probably thought they didn't care about him since they weren't spending the Summer or part of it with him. I do think your father went too far with absolutely no contact. The sisters are AHs for saying they will show up to your house when they're not invited. Plan on them showing up.", "NTA.

Is there any way you can change the venue? \n\nNot related to judgement - I had to laugh at your dad\u2019s karmic justice. BUT I also will say he\u2019s being a dick to them about it. I get that he\u2019s hurt, but they have a right to find their bio dad and they shouldn\u2019t be punished for it. What he did was stone cold.", "NTA- regardless of what\u2019s gone down with everyone else, you are doing what is right for you, your wife and daughter.

Ignore them, their mother was the first asshole for lying and then they became assholes for sneaking and lying to your dad. That's his issue to deal with and if he said he's done then he's done. Don't' get involved. And don't' let them in your house.", "NTA - None of this should be your problem. Stick to your boundaries.

That was very wrong of him, given that he was the only father you had ever known. But that's between you and him. It has nothing to do with me. So no, you cannot use *my* Christmas celebration to try to force him to reconcile with you. And the fact you have enlisted your family members to pressure me makes me even *less* interested in being involved.\"\n\nNTA. As far as I can tell, the biggest AH here is your father (what kind of person refuses to *talk* to the daughters he raised just because they--quite reasonably--want to have a relationship with their biological parent??? I can't get over his cruelty), followed by your family members who are supporting/encouraging him in his cruelty. \n\nBella and Amy are AHs to try to force you to be in the middle, but they are young and desperate to talk to their dad... Their behavior is understandable, just inappropriate", "Your dad just sounds awful.", "NTA\n\nThey aren't your sister's, at best, they are step-sisters. You have no obligation to them, as you've never been close. Their relationship with your father isn't any of your business.\n\nMake sure they understand if they come to your house, you will call the police and have them removed. If they show up, do not open the door and call the cops. Tell them they are trespassing and you want them removed.\n\n\nNot your circus and not your monkeys.\n\nEdit - removed a sentence, as I didn't want to put blame on the twins. Yes, they withheld their relationship with bio-dad, but it likely was to spare the fathers feelings.\n\nThe dad is the asshole.", "NTA.

First let me start by saying NTA.\n\nThe only reason why Bella and Amy want to talk to your dad now is because he cut them off.  They need to spend Xmas with their dad and be happy.  How dare they just invite them over to your home.  \n\nPlease also tell them if they show up they will be met by the police because this is not your monkey and not your show.", "A huge mess that has nothing to do with you. I'm honestly impressed that you're letting your father come for Christmas. They need to work through whatever they want to work through without involving you.  NTA", "NTA\n\nMan, that is a really tough situation. Unfortunately, your dad is going to have to sort through it himself. I don't think he should have moved and cut all support. He raised them as his own for 16 years and that should have meant he was bonded to them even if he wasn't their blood father. He has to know that most adopted kids want to have a relationship with their bio parents as well if it is possible. I know that wasn't the exact situation, and that's where his hurt came from, but unfortunately that's more what it will be like for the twins. It's natural to want to know who you share blood with, especially at that age. I understand his hurt was about his wife and it was all bundled in together so he made big decisions. Now he has to deal with them. \n\nBut your post isn't about him or the twins. It's about your decision. I agree that this is not your circus, not your monkeys. Your dad and the twins have to make things right, but you don't have to have it hosted at your house if you don't want to.

Your Christmas, that you are hosting, isn't for them to decide to confront or reconcile with your father, it is for your family- the one's you choose- to be together and have fun. \n\nIt isn't your job to facilitate any relationships. You have asked your father to come for Christmas, and these two ladies are not invited, the end.
