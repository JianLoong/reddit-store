If you have the room to house the out of state guests, it's weird to let them pay for the *one night* stay. I get that it's your income, but they didn't come for a private holiday but for your husband's birthday party. You keep going on and on about the things you paid for, like food and drink, which is just part of a party. Do you expect knighthood as a thank you for offering food and drink to *your* guests that *you* invited? No one forced you!\n\nThat said, all your guests were aware of the cost of staying over. They should have complained beforehand and looked for another accomodation or, alternatively, looked for another place to stay.", "I can't believe you are going on about making money off GUESTS. Complimentary food and drink and a reduced rate for staying over for your guests. Wow!\n\n5-star rating for being YTA.", "If you invite people to a party you should have food and drink ready for them. \"Complimentary\" food and drinks? That's obvious. You threw a party and invited folk. People aren't going to a party worrying about how much it cost the host and what sort of debts they're incurring. Hopefully they are just enjoying the party. Sounds like a trap, the way you're talking about this. I'm nervous.\n\nSounds like you're very service-minded. When you recall this friend putting you up for a night you focus on lack of amenities, not on the kindness of being welcomed into somebody's home. Like, he didn't do you a favour cos he didn't have enough beds for guests or aircon? Home is home.\n\nHe gave you somewhere to sleep for the night, and when he needed somewhere to stay for a party you invited him to, you charged him...\n\nYTA\n\nThe airbnb being \"your business\" is beside the point. \"It isn't personal, it's business\" is literally what assholes say. Be a friend to your friends and the friends of your husband. Don't go through life counting pennies.", "ESH.\n\nThe friend sucks for agreeing to pay beforehand and then sneakily going behind your back and complaining to your husband.\n\nBut charging *guests* for accommodation *to your husband's surprise party*? That you invited them to? Yeesh. Supplying your party guests with food and drinks is also your job as the host, there's nothing complementary about this. It sounds like you were making money off your guests.", "YTA - making money off of your birthday is so low id be ashamed if i was your husband. hell, these guys should bill you two since its a business, no?", "YTA. Selfish and only focused on your income. AirBnB are killing the rental market and you\u2019re nickel and diming your friends because \u201cmUh BuIsInEsS\u201d", "ESH\n\nYou asked your husband\u2019s friends to pay to stay ay your friend\u2019s Airbnb. Totally understandable. I understand you charging a fee for your Airbnb (cleaning services). I don\u2019t understand why your husband\u2019s friends were impacting your business. You chose to host an event. Then offered your lodging facilities to guests. The only way you lost money on this party is if you turned away full paying guests. Otherwise, you had 3 empty Airbnbs that were not paying you anything. So you made money. \n\nFriend didn\u2019t think it was fair to charge people. He has the right to speak his opinion. However, if he agreed to the terms before the party then he needed to just pay up.", "YTA. You keep talking about the food and drinks that you provided that THEY HAD THE AUDACITY TO EAT!! Unless it's a potluck....that's what happens when you throw a party. You provide food and drinks. And it was for one night.....is business so boomin or your finances so bad you can't spare one night?!!\n\nSo the AH", "YTA, you threw a party but charged people who had previously hosted you to stay at yours. The comfort level of your previous visit to theirs is of no consequence. Just because it\u2019s your business doesn\u2019t mean you ALWAYS have to I get money off of it. \n\nNewsflash, hosting a party will almost always be a financial loss for the host/hostess. People still do it because it\u2019s fun and bonding with others is important. You don\u2019t get bonus pats on the back for cOmPLiMeNtArY snacks and drinks. Stop hosting parties if you\u2019re going to be so cheap and stingy.", "Yta, you don't expect people to pay to stay with you for something you invited them to. If you had to pay for a hotel, it would be one thing if you mentioned the cost on the invite. To charge guests for your lost income is like telling them you had to take a day off work to prepare for the party and they need to pay you back for that.", "YTA\n\nEvery single person who hears about this will think of you as a tight fisted money grabber.  You have never been charged by any of your friends to stay with them but the one time you invite them to stay with you then you immediately hold your hand out.", "ESH you for asking for the money and the friend for waiting until after he stayed to say he wouldn\u2019t pay it.", "If someone invited me to a party then tried to charge me for staying with them I\u2019d tell them to go fuck themselves, YTA", "Kinda YTA. These r like grey areas in friendships where friends have different opinions. But, charging them for accommodation in your own airbnb for a party you hosted doesn\u2019t seem good", "Soft YTA, I think it really isn't that great a look on your generosity as a person to ask guests to pay to spend the night. \n\nI would rather be offered a mattress on the attic than have my friend make me pay for a nice Airbnb, it is not about comfort, we can all buy comfort at hotels, it is about kindness. \n\nBut then again, it is within your right to be unkind, so... Keep doing what you're doing?", "YTA. Throwing a party with \"complimentary\" food and drink (lol) and expecting your **GUESTS** to pay for lodging? What an incredibly tacky woman you are. If I was your husband I'd be so embarrassed of you right now.", "INFO: Have you told him before, that he has to pay for the night?", "Did he agree to pay before coming for the party? If he did the NTA.", "NTA, if he had taken a hotel room, he would have paid more. When I throw a party guest usually don't Stay with us as we don't have space to host all the guests needing a room. You offered them a cheaper solution which they agreed to take. In the end they went back in their word. This is a shitty move.", "NTA he didn\u2019t stay in your home he stayed in your Airb&b. If you owned a hotel instead he would still have to pay.", "You were upfront about the cost. So NTA. If he had had issues with paying he should have brought it up BEFORE taking advantage of your Airbnb or he should have rented something else in the neighborhood.", "\r  \nNTA, Absolutely not unreasonable. It's your business, your primary income, and the significant reduction in the cost was already very generous. It's fair to expect payment, especially when other guests also paid for their accommodation. The party you organized involved a considerable cost, and their staying over involved resources, including food and drinks that were provided. Your husband's friend might have misunderstood the situation or might not be aware of the effort and expenses involved in running an Airbnb. However, your expectation for payment is entirely valid, especially when it's part of your business and everyone else paid for their stay. Your request for payment is not only reasonable but also fair, considering the context.", "NTA- I\u2019m assuming that when you sent out invites you also let people know that you had discounted accommodation if they wished to use them. No one forced them to come or forced them to stay at the accommodations offered. I\u2019m guessing the party was on a weekend where the Airbnb would normally be booked. It is your business and you still have operating costs, like cleaning after they have been used. If you had to have the unit cleaned then now they have cost you money.", "NTA- you let everyone know before hand if they wanted to stay they had to pay. Sooo him and his gf chose to stay they now have to pay. If you had not stated anything before hand then you\u2019d be the AH.", "YTA.\n\nLandlords gonna landlord. It\u2019s tacky as hell to try to make money off your friends. I\u2019m a lawyer, I would never dream of sending a friend an invoice after I help them read through a contract or something.\n\nIf my friend did this to me I\u2019d probably never hang out with them again.", "NTA. you were crystal clear about the cost and he is a jackass bringing up the stay you had to ABORT have way through because it was unbearable", "NTA, you told them up front, they accepted by staying, they owe you the money.", "NTA. The dude agreed to pay, took what was offered, and then didn't. It would be different if he'd said ahead of time that he still couldn't afford it, but he didn't.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
