You are doing her a huge favor in more ways than one and you are setting her up for success.  Great job Mom!\n\nYour husband's financial concerns are valid, however, there can be a compromise.  You contribute as you said, but it may require just looking at your budget, where can you save, where can you make adjustments that will help you maintain this practice but not feel like you are breaking the bank.\n\nThere can be viable and productive solutions to this, you just have to look at the problem from a different perspective.  \n\nHow can we find a win, win solution that addresses everyone's concerns.", "Kinda the AH, it sounds like he provides for the family, money is tight, he\u2019s stressed, and doesn\u2019t think a frivolous indulgence for the both of you is a good idea", "NTA I'm all for helping your daughter's mental health. Is there a way to lower the cost tho? Is it $60 for the both of you? Is it nail polish only?", "NTA. You're gently encouraging self care in a positive way, this is a massive benefit to her mental health.", "NTA, \nNot only you care about her well-being but it is bounding time for the both of you! By doing that, you actively help her with her self esteem and you show that you love and care about her by actually making time for her on a regular basis.", "Yes, YTA. Seems like your family cannot really afford it, which your husband understands, but you do not. First, there are cheaper options for self-care and pampering than doing nails for $60. Second, you're an effing adult, go find a job which will allow to to earn extra $60/month for your daughter. Third, to get better your daughter needs therapy, not manicure.
