However, from what you have said, she is at the beginning of her therapy journey and diagnosis, it is possible that she would walk over boundaries and not care, at which point, you could end up refusing to support her and sister in law. \n\nYes, it\u2019s horrible that your sister in law is struggling, it so difficult for parent when their kids have mental health issues and trying to support them and manage work and other commitments.

Do not let that girl into your home no matter what!!!! Tell your husband if she\u2019s his priority over the well-being of his own children he is free to go babysit her at his sister\u2019s home. Don\u2019t budge. This is a hill to die on.", "Respite care might be a good option as sometimes insurance will pay for that", "Or even just if she gets hurt in a manner that could look like she's engaged in the behavior that got her involuntary commitment again. Like if she burns herself cooking or something.", "Absolutely agree with all you\u2019ve said, OP NTA & also by not stepping in you guys may be helping the niece because watching her may put her in more danger than her family realizes. She needs more specialized care than you can provide so I\u2019d be hesitant to take this on for her sake. \n\nDefinitely see if there is something else you can offer to help if you guys have the means", "Great practical tip!", "The emotional harm someone with narcissistic personality disorder can do seriously cannot be stressed enough. I don't know if she's been violent to others, but it isn't a leap if she's hurting herself. \n\nAnd as someone who grew up with a parent diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder, being around that as a child does damage. 12 hours a day would be an incredibly long time for you and your kids to be around her.", "I have a cousin who\u2019s a narcissist and at 16 she was like the devil herself. Absolutely unpredictable and just fucking mean. \n\nNTA- OP now that she knows you don\u2019t want her around, it\u2019s even more important you keep her away from your children.", "I agree, something is wrong in this story. Not only should she not be released if she requires 24/7 care, but being diagnosed with NPD before age 18 is concerning. It goes against best practices. Plenty of teenagers display symptoms of NPD either due to the nature of being a teenager or because they are unable to cope with life events. \n\nThis kid needs more mental health assistance, probably at a different institution.", "Also if niece is out on leave9o hubby can be watching the niece say 12 hours per week in niece's home. Then do 12 hours of child care at home for his own kids", "Totally agree. OP is NTA, but her delivery sounds unkind. \n\nOP, your kids are absolutely your first priority.

She's  over 40 now and in a much better place mentally.", "Calling a mentally unwell person psycho is not okay.", "you are stupidly ignorant", "No matter what the neices issue is. Op has 3 small kids that in itself is a full time job. She does not have the time or probably the energy to take on this kidz\n\nHer only responsibility is to her kids that would be exposed to some horrendously hurtful things. No parent should even consider exposing small kids to the neices behavior. \n\nShe has already hurt herself. She has showed no regard to others feeling or well being. If op caves and something happens to one of her kids at the neices hands what then. Is everyone going to say we didn\u2019t think neice would go this far.\n\nOp can be sympathetic from a far. She does not need to sit herself or her family on fire to keep the neice warm to show she isn\u2019t heartless. \n\nAnd quit frankly if that\u2019s what the in-laws expect then screw diplomacy and go nuclear.", "yeah i stopped reading after that. no responsible psychiatrist is diagnosing anyone under 18 with a personality disorder, especially not NPD. someone\u2019s bullshitting here", "Why are you acting like it's impossible for a teenager to experience severe mental illness and/or personality disorders? Why are you acting like teenagers can't be dangerous? Do you have access to the news?\nWould you hire the person she described as a babysitter? I mean I suppose you can say you would, but we all know you wouldn't.", "My mother died in cancer. It cane to a point when caring for her ar hone was no longer enough to fill her needs. The solution for that was NOT to get LESS educated and less professional people caring for her  in anothers home that was not well medically equipped.\nPuttning up OP as caregiver is not providing niece with the essential care.", "So, we all know that you shouldn't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm... but you **really** shouldn't set your 3 kids on fire to keep someone else warm. My brother has severe mental health issues. I carry a great deal of very ugly very deep physical scars from having to 'play nice' and 'watch your brother'. You are spot on your children will be in serious danger here. Anyone not getting that is in horrifying denial. It isn't the 16 year olds fault. But the lack of fault does not negate the danger.", "I am so going to use this saying!!! Brilliant", "This is the worst part of loving a people-pleaser/doormat. If you're married to them or they're your parent, you will also be expected to people please and let people walk all over you in service of the doormat's need to appease everyone else. I have a good friend whose parents raised her this way and even as an adult with her own family now they expect her to make the choices that are best for all three of them (her + her parents), not just do what's best for her. It's so sad.", "Husband can go watch his niece at her house when it's \"his turn\"  if he wants to keep the peace so badly.\n\nNo need to involve OP or their kids at all. He can put his money where his mouth is and step up for his niece over at HER house.", ">He is willing to throw OP under the bus\n\nWorse than that. He's willing to let his kids be abused just so he can get his family off his back.", "He should plan to take off work and take care of the niece while you and the kids are away fr the day, since he feels the need to participate. This will likely change his mind. Make sure he knows if the niece is dropped off, you and the kids will go out and he should rush home to watch her.

Sounds like mom is disparate (which I get) and hasn\u2019t told the family everything (which puts anyone she is staying with in danger).\n\nMom needs to hire a sitter.", "I was once in a depressed don\u2019t love my life mood that was bad enough my friends took it upon them to make sure I wasn\u2019t alone for a couple days. Mentioned this to a social worker/therapist at my appointment and was told if I can\u2019t be alone I need to be at the hospital and got committed. I wasn\u2019t even doing anything physical to myself, just had really bad thoughts and I got committed. If this girl has a history and no one feels safe with her being alone, she definitely should be hospitalized again. That\u2019s the whole point of inpatient care, keeping people safe 24/7 when they can\u2019t keep themselves safe.", "Children under 18 cannot be diagnosed at psychopaths or sociopaths. They will be diagnosed most often with Borderline Personality Disorder or Conduct Disorder. Psychopathy is a real mental illness, just not a term applied to those under 18.", "You\u2019re so mad\u2026LOL.", "NTA Your husband and your job is to protect and prioritize your Immediate family .. as in each other and your children.

You clearly aren't willing to actually consider other opinions on this?", "Excellent first person report of what it is like living with someone who has NPD AND bipolar disorder. \n\nSpeaking as a mental health professional, OP is NTA. Mom keep your little ones at home safe. Gawd only knows what she would subject the littles too. I would also caution your husband about being alone with her. There's a good chance she would accuse him of abuse. Actually, since she knows you refused to have her in your house there is a very high probability she will do something to exact \"revenge\" on you and your family. People with NPD hate to be told no and can be vindictive. As for the family members who are pressuring you to take her in, tell them to move her into their house.\n\nI'm anticipating some of you are going to jump on me for saying negative things about this girl. I used to work with kids like this. Frankly, some of them are downright scary because they do not who they hurt as long as they get what they want.", "Personally I think the neices mom isn\u2019t giving the family all the details. I think the diagnosis is worse then she is saying. But the mom is desperate and not willing to give full disclosure which could be really dangerous.\n\nBut even if the diagnosis is not bad. Even if the neice is only needing to be watched to keep her from hurting  herself. Op has 3 small kids. The kind of care the neice would need isn\u2019t something op could provide. She is already stretched thin with 3 small kids. If the neice falls through the cracks she could hurt herself. It be irresponsible for op to take on something she can\u2019t handle", "Oh no, don't get me wrong, the OP shouldn't be a caregiver. I'm just talking about the tone in which she talks about someone who is legitimately sick is pretty harsh. The niece needs professional care, absolutely. That's the only way she'll get through this. Whether that is inpatient or outpatient only her doctors and parents know, but I'm just saying it's okay to have strict boundaries and not be an AH to the sick person at the same time. The OP doesn't sound like a person who has much empathy, which is what we need more of in this world. The 16 year old's response and actions sound normal for someone with her diagnosis.", "People really don't like to talk about how much it messes up the other kids around people with these issues. My sister had a personality disorder and was extremely mentally/emotionally/physically abusive. At one point she tried to break my arm because she wasn't getting her way, another she stood outside the bathroom (I'd locked myself in after a fight with my mom) and gave me detailed instructions on how to discharge myself to Jesus with what was available in the room while telling me I was an unloved mistake.\n\nMy mom forced me to maintain contact with her even after we'd moved away (sister refused/stayed with family) until she threatened to summon demons to torture me. My family is why I've got CPTSD and will be in therapy until I die, but my mom still tries to make it seem like we just don't get along/mesh well when irl I just don't like being abused.", "\u201cSo, we all know that you shouldn't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm... \u201c\n\nI love this so much! Such a good reminder and great way to say that!", "My sympathy runs out when it's this kind of situation - where kids (*their* kids, no less) and their partner are the ones who would suffer.\n\nIt's easy for doormats and people pleasers to hide behind *that* like it's a get out of jail free card. They are adults, if they want to let people walk all over them, they should, but when it's I want to make *other people* roll over, then it's just them being weak-willed as well as assholes.\n\nThat's OP's husband; oh no, my kids and wife don't want to be near a **literal** out of control, mean, cruel, bully, *but* my family is annoying me... Hmm.... He puts it as \"he's between a rock and a hard place\" except he's already decided him being berated is more important than his family's well being, so, there is no rock, and there is no hard place because he's shown *there is no choice for him*, it's not A or B, it's A (and it ain't his family - or... It ain't his spouse and kids).", "What money, what mouth?\n\nHis solution is for *OP* (and their kids) to deal with it because it's the easiest solution for him, it's the law of minimum effort, and he wants to implement it.", "From experience unfortunately they won't always keep kids who need the 24/7 watch as that's the parents job.  Don't matter if you work or have other children", "That\u2019s literally not how that works. It\u2019s a reason behind emotions and behavior it\u2019s not an excuse. She needs medical treatment", "Glad you mentioned about protecting her husband because you are exactly right, her niece would lie and cry so convincingly its scary.  I hope she sees your comment.  \n\nLiving with my brother was literally a daily fight for my own existence, so many other horrible things he did.  It was many years ago and thankfully ive had no contact for many years.  But unless you live with someone like that, it is truly hard to describe how a human being can have no empathy, no compassion, but they dont. It is like a darkness in their soul.  OP's kids will be endangered if she ever is in contact with them, so i hope OP holds firm.i have compassion for her niece's mom though. How hellacious her life probably is.", "Thank you.  He was & is a horrid person and i, of course, have no contact with him for many yrs, thankfully.  but unless one has lived with someone like that it is hard to describe how they have no feelings empathy -- like a darkness in their soul.", "Thank you, its been over for a long time, thankfully ive had no contact with him for many many years.  i would want no one to go through things like that, so i hope OP holds firm.  i know some people go thru worse. i try to see the good in everything and i will say that escaping from him& by going away to college when i was 17, it gave me strengths i needed later in life to get thru other things that came up.", "Your mom is your abuser as much as your sister.

No. Still can't as I shake too much to hold a fork with my 4x broken hand. Yay therapy!", "That absolutely sucks. I know as an adult they can only hold you for 48-72 hours (I think it depends where you are) before needing a judge to sign off saying they can keep you longer if you go against your will. But I\u2019d think with minors they would be even more strict. I also recognize inpatient care can fill up quickly and lack beds which may be why they don\u2019t care with minors in the long term. Just sucks for everyone.", "Haha cute that you'd throw the \"lol username\" card, given that you're here on a crusade against a teenage girl. Cut the crap. This isn't about letting the child live with her it's about whether her behaviour towards the child is malicious.\n\nBe fucking honest with yourself that the way the adults in her life treat her is more probably the cause not the effect. Troubled teens don't come from nowhere and it's not a cocktail of mental illnesses that just *looks* exactly like a cry for attention.\n\n  \nIf you forget the pejoratives and diagnoses that OP throws at you to make you believe she is and always will be 100% evil, what do you honestly see? Does this really add up to \"bipolar narcissist\"? She's a bully that self harms. What could you discern from that if OP hadn't told you how to feel?", "Yes, but she's been doing a lot to try to work on herself in the last few years. Her mom and stepdad were alcoholic drug addicts that abused/neglected her even into adulthood to the point that her \"normal\" is severely warped. It's hard to recognize and call out abuse when that's the standard. It caused a huge generational rift in my family that resulted in me getting physically and verbally assaulted more than once before my grandparents' generation was cut out. I don't forgive her for most of it but I've done my best to make my peace with it because I'm okay with maintaining a distanced relationship at this point.", "My mom's thing is wanting things to be peaceful for my niblings. Sister uses them as pawns and is pissed I returned the chessboard to sender instead of engaging. I already moved to a different state and plan to leave the country once I finish my degree, so she does her best to keep it to herself now. She's also accepted that even in the event of her death I will never engage with my sister in any meaningful way instead of pushing the \"you're all each other has in this world once I die\" song and dance I used to get.", "It really does.  They usually only hold kids for 3 to 5 days.  Just long enough to jack up their meds and send them on their way.
