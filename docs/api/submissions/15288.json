I said no, immediately. Now I know I'm going to sound heartless here but *this* is not my problem. I have 3 small children that I absolutely cannot have this girl around. Not because of what she did that landed her in the hospital but because of her narcissistic evil streak. She's mean. I mean, she tells her other cousin that she \"can't wait\" to go to her funeral (her cousin is 12) and then pulls the \"omg you're so fucking overemotional and annoying\" when the cousin cries about it. I don't want this girl anywhere near my children and to be quite frank, I don't want her anywhere near my house. I'm not her mom and she is not my problem. My children are my problem and having her here would potentially be a much bigger problem. \n\nNow, when I said no, I got A LOT of \"are you fucking serious?\" looks. My other SIL said \"Woooow, I will just keep her here with me\"- and my husband's niece immediately lost her shit about it (ie: \"why would I want to stay here? I don't even like you guys and don't want to be around your kid\"). Her mother didn't try correcting her either. She's just a fucking snot. But anyways, the family is blowing fire down my husband's back for allowing me to be \"so fucking heartless\" and not \"opening my doors to a child in need\". I still say it's not my problem.
