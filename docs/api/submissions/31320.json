Whenever we go out she never pays for stuff, whether it's the dinner bill, tickets for the movies etc, we always end up paying for her. But everyone accepted this and doesn't really have an issue with it.\n\nHowever recently, it's become worse. She's been dating this guy for a couple of months and she brings him everywhere with her, even when he's not invited. So now we have two people to pay for. \n\nAlso I feel like I have to say that they have jobs, they're not struggling. It'd be different if they were broke, then of course I wouldn't mind. \n\nBut ya, we had the dinner last night and everybody brought food and put a lot of effort into it.These two however showed up with absolutely nothing. Not even a bottle of soda. \n\nWe were annoyed but nobody said anything. It wasn't until the end of the night when they were leaving, that I cracked a little.\n\nThe friend's bf was taking home ALL the bbq ribs that were left. I repeat, ALL of it and it was a lot. Like damn, be considerate at least. He emptied the entire tray of ribs into a container. \n\nThat's when I politely asked \"Can you maybe not take all of it? The others might want some too\". \n\nHe got all defensive and asked \"Why are you treating me like I'm stealing all the food?\". \n\nI clarified that I never said such a thing and that I only asked that he didn't take ALL of it.\n\nHe got angry, plopped the ribs back and said, \"Fine, I don't need your food\" to which I replied, \"It kinda seems like you do and to be honest, you shouldn't have eaten at all since you didn't contribute again, as usual\". \n\nThen my friend came, took him and just left without saying anything. Now apparently, she's angry with us...mainly me. \n\nMost of my friend group doesn't think I did anything wrong but there are a couple who are saying that I shouldn't have said anything. \n\nThe thing is that I didn't even say anything to my friend because I don't mind that she doesn't contribute. \n\nHer boyfriend was the one irritating me. He eats the most food but doesn't contribute, drinks the most alcohol - doesn't contribute, orders really expensive meals at restaurants - doesn't contribute towards the bill. I guess I got kind of annoyed and snapped at him. \n\nI tried phoning her to clarify that I don't have any issue with her but she's ignoring me. I dunno, maybe I should've left well enough alone.", "created_utc": 1700446530, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17zdr82/aita_for_telling_my_friends_bf_that_he_shouldnt/", "score": 7308, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sally then explained that Kay never went to lunch unless the guys were paying, so she was concerned that maybe there were some hardships at home.

But everyone accepted this and doesn't really have an issue with it.\n\nHowever recently, it's become worse. She's been dating this guy for a couple of months and she brings him everywhere with her, even when he's not invited. So now we have two people to pay for. \n\nAlso I feel like I have to say that they have jobs, they're not struggling. It'd be different if they were broke, then of course I wouldn't mind. \n\nBut ya, we had the dinner last night and everybody brought food and put a lot of effort into it.These two however showed up with absolutely nothing. Not even a bottle of soda. \n\nWe were annoyed but nobody said anything. It wasn't until the end of the night when they were leaving, that I cracked a little.\n\nThe friend's bf was taking home ALL the bbq ribs that were left. I repeat, ALL of it and it was a lot. Like damn, be considerate at least. He emptied the entire tray of ribs into a container. \n\nThat's when I politely asked \"Can you maybe not take all of it? The others might want some too\". \n\nHe got all defensive and asked \"Why are you treating me like I'm stealing all the food?\". \n\nI clarified that I never said such a thing and that I only asked that he didn't take ALL of it.\n\nHe got angry, plopped the ribs back and said, \"Fine, I don't need your food\" to which I replied, \"It kinda seems like you do and to be honest, you shouldn't have eaten at all since you didn't contribute again, as usual\". \n\nThen my friend came, took him and just left without saying anything. Now apparently, she's angry with us...mainly me. \n\nMost of my friend group doesn't think I did anything wrong but there are a couple who are saying that I shouldn't have said anything. \n\nThe thing is that I didn't even say anything to my friend because I don't mind that she doesn't contribute. \n\nHer boyfriend was the one irritating me. He eats the most food but doesn't contribute, drinks the most alcohol - doesn't contribute, orders really expensive meals at restaurants - doesn't contribute towards the bill. I guess I got kind of annoyed and snapped at him. \n\nI tried phoning her to clarify that I don't have any issue with her but she's ignoring me. I dunno, maybe I should've left well enough alone.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
