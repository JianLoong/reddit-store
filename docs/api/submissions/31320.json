Whenever we go out she never pays for stuff, whether it's the dinner bill, tickets for the movies etc, we always end up paying for her. But everyone accepted this and doesn't really have an issue with it.\n\nHowever recently, it's become worse. She's been dating this guy for a couple of months and she brings him everywhere with her, even when he's not invited. So now we have two people to pay for. \n\nAlso I feel like I have to say that they have jobs, they're not struggling. It'd be different if they were broke, then of course I wouldn't mind. \n\nBut ya, we had the dinner last night and everybody brought food and put a lot of effort into it.These two however showed up with absolutely nothing. Not even a bottle of soda. \n\nWe were annoyed but nobody said anything. It wasn't until the end of the night when they were leaving, that I cracked a little.\n\nThe friend's bf was taking home ALL the bbq ribs that were left. I repeat, ALL of it and it was a lot. Like damn, be considerate at least. He emptied the entire tray of ribs into a container. \n\nThat's when I politely asked \"Can you maybe not take all of it? The others might want some too\". \n\nHe got all defensive and asked \"Why are you treating me like I'm stealing all the food?\". \n\nI clarified that I never said such a thing and that I only asked that he didn't take ALL of it.\n\nHe got angry, plopped the ribs back and said, \"Fine, I don't need your food\" to which I replied, \"It kinda seems like you do and to be honest, you shouldn't have eaten at all since you didn't contribute again, as usual\". \n\nThen my friend came, took him and just left without saying anything. Now apparently, she's angry with us...mainly me. \n\nMost of my friend group doesn't think I did anything wrong but there are a couple who are saying that I shouldn't have said anything. \n\nThe thing is that I didn't even say anything to my friend because I don't mind that she doesn't contribute. \n\nHer boyfriend was the one irritating me. He eats the most food but doesn't contribute, drinks the most alcohol - doesn't contribute, orders really expensive meals at restaurants - doesn't contribute towards the bill. I guess I got kind of annoyed and snapped at him. \n\nI tried phoning her to clarify that I don't have any issue with her but she's ignoring me. I dunno, maybe I should've left well enough alone.", "created_utc": 1700446530, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17zdr82/aita_for_telling_my_friends_bf_that_he_shouldnt/", "score": 3231, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Surprised by the question, Kay asked her what she meant.  Sally then explained that Kay never went to lunch unless the guys were paying, so she was concerned that maybe there were some hardships at home.

Whenever we go out she never pays for stuff, whether it's the dinner bill, tickets for the movies etc, we always end up paying for her. But everyone accepted this and doesn't really have an issue with it.\n\nHowever recently, it's become worse. She's been dating this guy for a couple of months and she brings him everywhere with her, even when he's not invited. So now we have two people to pay for. \n\nAlso I feel like I have to say that they have jobs, they're not struggling. It'd be different if they were broke, then of course I wouldn't mind. \n\nBut ya, we had the dinner last night and everybody brought food and put a lot of effort into it.These two however showed up with absolutely nothing. Not even a bottle of soda. \n\nWe were annoyed but nobody said anything. It wasn't until the end of the night when they were leaving, that I cracked a little.\n\nThe friend's bf was taking home ALL the bbq ribs that were left. I repeat, ALL of it and it was a lot. Like damn, be considerate at least. He emptied the entire tray of ribs into a container. \n\nThat's when I politely asked \"Can you maybe not take all of it? The others might want some too\". \n\nHe got all defensive and asked \"Why are you treating me like I'm stealing all the food?\". \n\nI clarified that I never said such a thing and that I only asked that he didn't take ALL of it.\n\nHe got angry, plopped the ribs back and said, \"Fine, I don't need your food\" to which I replied, \"It kinda seems like you do and to be honest, you shouldn't have eaten at all since you didn't contribute again, as usual\". \n\nThen my friend came, took him and just left without saying anything. Now apparently, she's angry with us...mainly me. \n\nMost of my friend group doesn't think I did anything wrong but there are a couple who are saying that I shouldn't have said anything. \n\nThe thing is that I didn't even say anything to my friend because I don't mind that she doesn't contribute. \n\nHer boyfriend was the one irritating me. He eats the most food but doesn't contribute, drinks the most alcohol - doesn't contribute, orders really expensive meals at restaurants - doesn't contribute towards the bill. I guess I got kind of annoyed and snapped at him. \n\nI tried phoning her to clarify that I don't have any issue with her but she's ignoring me. I dunno, maybe I should've left well enough alone.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This might have ended that friendship and that might be just fine.", "NTA, but why allow these two to pull this crap? Your friends who are telling you to \u201cnot say anything \u201c are exactly the reason these two continue to scam everyone. Stop including them in your events.", "NTA", "She\u2019s not your friend.", "You all should have an issue with someone taking advantage of you. Dollars to donuts if you or any of you feigned brokeness at an outing she would not reciprocate the years of kindness shown to her. Because y'all have allowed this chicanery from her it's become an entitlement to her, one she feels her boyfriend should be allowed to partake in. NTA but y'all need to do better cause it sounds like y'all are a bunch of pushovers.", "Why in the world are you paying for their movies and food when you go out. NTA for saying something. YTA, and so are all your friends for enabling this behavior", "Going out tell her they have to pay or please don't come!! Get some brass ovaries for Pete's sake.", "NTA. OP I do not understand why you waited until the feeling to confront boiled to the top. If nothing is said then permissiveness grants entitled mooches. Mooches bring a long more mooches.\n\nIt gets costly to pay it forward to a mooch who has not earned the kindness.", "NTA. I think you should leave well enough alone NOW. WTH is wrong with them?  I would never presume to go to a restaurant with friends and not expect to pay unless special arrangements were made previously. And MAYBE GF didn't tell new BF that get together meals were potluck, at least not the first time. Don't they feel weird walking into places where obviously everyone brought a dish and they're empty handed? \n\nI say let it stand until they learn not to mooch off everyone's good graces. Either that or I want in on that deal!  LOL", "NTA. You had the perfect opportunity to call your friend out for her mooching, why would you lie to her and tell her it\u2019s okay that she\u2019s using you and letting her boyfriend abuse your generosity?", "NTA for this but an asshole for letting their mooching slide for so long.", "Send a stronger message and just stop inviting her. NTA.", "You should call her and tell her that neither of them are invited anymore, unless they pay the bill for everything for the next 6 months.", "NTA. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t seem real to me. How are people just out here paying for a friend all the time? It makes no sense how it even happens. When the check comes just don\u2019t pay for them. Not your problem.", "NTA.\n\nStop allowing them to walk all over you. She\u2019s not a good friend. He\u2019s not a good person either.

Stop enabling your friend and by extension her bf. Talk to the rest of the friend group and put a united front on and just tell her that you won\u2019t be subsidizing her life or her relationship any more.

You\u2019re absolutely NTA!", "NTA\n\nBut then again maybe a bit.\n\nWhy not call them out for their shitty behavior?? \n\nWhy let them continue to use you?\n\nStand up for yourself, you don't need such \"friends\"", "It was high time that someone said something to that leach.

None of your group has the guts to refuse to pay for him or tell him to stop showing up empty handed. Drawing a line at him stealing all the leftovers everyone  else paid for was long overdue. When you go to restaurants, tell the server SEPERATE CHECKS as soon as you sit down. Stop feeding the rude, greedy boyfriend and the has-a-job-but-no-self-awareness friend. She MAY possibly stop being such a mooch, but he never will.\n\nNTA. Good job standing up for yourself and your friends. Keep it up.", "NTA. Your friend is not a friend, they are a user/mooch. She needs to start contributing or find another group of friends. She can bring her mooching boyfriend with her. (I would have said something WELL BEFORE this get together. If they feel bad or ostracized that\u2019s on them not everyone else)", "As long as you let her walk all over you she'll continue to do that.  You are enabling her by not putting a stop to her mooching.", "Nta. People like this make others feel uncomfortable about standing up to them. It is the way they opperate. Making YOU the bad guy when you clearly are not. \n\nIt isnt by mistake but design. \n\nIf she has always been this way.. birds of a feather? If not .. maybe hang in with her and try to sus out what the deal is.", "NTA in general, but honestly you are an AH to yourself.\n\nYou can't control what your other friends do, but you can control what you do. So speak with all of your friends and say that from now on you will only pay for your meals, tickets, etc. You won't use your money anymore to pay for the bills of your moocher \"friend\" and her BF. They are both users and not friends to any of you. \n\nIn all likelihood other friends will join in and will stop paying for them, too, and it totally wouldn't surprise me if your moocher \"friend\" and BF will stop coming then as they are not your friends, they are just using you for free meals and tickets.\n\nSo be the start for a change for the better. Stop paying for them.", "NTA - why are you friends with these people?", "Stop paying their way going out. I dont even understand.

Even now you're wanting to reassure the friend that you don't have a problem with her. \n\nWhy have you and your friends accepted this situation when you say they are in financial need?\n\nYou are like a parent who has let their child get away with anything and now complains when they are a brat... And then wants to reassure them that you aren't mad at them.", "NTA imo, taking home leftovers that are not your own (unless you are invited to take them) IS stealing. So yes, your friends bf was attempting to steal. I personally would be pretty pissy if I saw someone taking my leftovers home with them. I paid for it, prepped it, anything that is not eaten is still mine. \nNot sure why you and your friends put up with this behavior. Either stop inviting them, or simply refuse to pay for them when the check comes. What are you going to do when the bf's mooching best friend, or brother, or sister starts coming along?", "I don't understand why you and your friends have been putting up with your one friend not paying her share. And I also don't understand why any of your friends are putting up with this new guy not paying HIS share. I mean how do you all justify that? \"Sure, Bob, I'll put $50 towards your alcohol and chicken wings, no problem, it's not like I have to pay rent or anything.\" I'm getting the impression that all of you have been raised to be people-pleasers who feel like the \"bad guy\" if you speak up for yourself. Maybe that's what you all have in common (except for your one friend who pays nothing, and her boyfriend, and I'm thinking maybe she picked you all out because she instinctively saw that she could take advantage of an entire group of people who are morally opposed to standing up for themselves.\n\nWhen her boyfriend said, \"Why are you treating me like I'm stealing all the food?\" you could have said, \"Because you are stealing all the food!\" Like what kind of man pays for NONE of the food and takes ALL of the leftovers? What the heck is that all about? \n\nI'm just confused by the people in your friend group who feel you shouldn't have said anything. They should all be applauding you and trying to start a whole new trend of ALL of you standing up for yourselves to these users.", "This was a problem that you all created. You always pay for the mooch and allow them to mooch. Now the mooch is comfortable to mooch because everyone else is footing the bill. She figures if it worked for her that her boyfriend can benefit as well. I would get get rid of mooch and her mooching bf. Tell them if they are not gonna contribute to events like everyone else does financially that they are no longer allowed to come and if they say they will next time make sure you split the bills. That way if mooch can\u2019t pay her bill she can\u2019t enjoy the benefits of food or anything and you can all leave them there if they can\u2019t pay. Which will make them be forced to pay their way. Honestly i would of dropped them as friends ages ago", "NTA. Call that crap out. It was long overdue.", "People who don't feel you're in the wrong but \"shouldn't have said anything\", are people absolutely terrified of confrontation and try to dismiss all of it as \"drama\" not worth getting into. Fuck that.\n\nNTA, but holy shit, all of you need to stop enabling the leeches. It's also gross that your friend thinks just a 2-month long boyfriend is somehow entitled to all of this shit just by being connected to her. High school romances have lasted longer than that and she's ignoring you like they've been dating for years, that's some sad shit.", "NTA but your whole group needs a wake up call. Quit letting her mooch off of everyone. That\u2019s not a friend, thats a leech.", "Allowing them to get away with ordering expensive food and not pay is just so wild to even comprehend, like what? Girl, no. Just no. Stop that shit.", "If anything, Y W B T A for letting it go on for so long.  \n\n\nNTA, but I'd suggest reevaluating your friend group.", "Should have potty train the gal way back when.  Our SIL did have this family of professional \"wedding crashers\" showing up at every one of her weekend parties uninvited.  First thing they did was start hiding trays of the good stuff under the table then gorge on all the good stuffs while they're there.  Then toward the end, they snuck out the hidden trays and load up the to go boxes never once helped with anything.  I started asking about who they were and no one could figure it out and they were turned away at the door after that.  Weird self entitled people. Any, next time and forever more announce to the waitstaff : SEPARATE CHECKS PLEASE.", "NTA\n\nI would tell your friend you are not paying for their entertainment, food, alcohol or anything anymore. She and bf need to be adults and pay their own way.", "Look if you invite people like that, part of the invitation is you understanding and expecting that they won't contribute. It's like if you invite them, you are choosing that they will come and not bring anything. So either don't invite, or for your own happiness, expect it so that you're not getting mad over and over about something that is no surprise. It's kinda turning into your guys' own fault for this reason. \n\nIt's also weird that you're mad at the boyfriend only. The original issue is your friend is an ass hole... Then she got an ass hole boyfriend. Then she invites him to come mooch off her friends over and over. He has been invited and taught to do so by your ass hole friend. The issue is her ultimately and you guys second for weirdly allowing and building this situation, then being mad at it as if it's a surprise.", "STOP SUBSIDIZING THE MOOCHES!\n\nGood grief, you and your friends need to stop bending over and taking it when she cries poor.\n\nStart minding that she contributes NOTHING!\n\nNext time, don\u2019t pay for her.\n\nNTA for calling out the boyfriend, but Y T A for letting these two take advantage of all of you.", "Stop inviting them.", "ESH\n\nI went with this for a few reasons.  \n\nOP and friends have without words let the original mooch (not kinda - she IS a mooch) know that they accept her never contributing.  Doesn\u2019t bring food to a pot luck, doesn\u2019t pay for her own ticket to whatever entertainment nor covers her part of the bill when eating out.  To their knowledge she doesn\u2019t have money problems so they apparently like the mooch enough they are okay with being used. \n\nWhat is interesting is OP is surprised the original mooch started bringing a date who is just as big a mooch and expects her friends to treat him the same as they do her which is to provide/cover everything while the mooches simply take.   Pretty sure the original mooch was shocked OP actually said anything. \n\nOP and friends should have stopped this long ago as people who mooch off others have zero/no respect for those they are using.  \n\nIf OP and friends don\u2019t want to continue to be used stop allowing the mooch to participate without paying her own way.", "She's not your friend she is using all of you for the free stuff and now she expects the same for her boyfriend. If you guys don't cut them both off your going to be paying for their kids as well.", "NTA, but why are you all paying for these moochers? That needs to stop.", "NTA- Someone needs to put their foot down with this pair. The level of arrogance required to assume that your company is payment/contribution enough is staggering.

It should\u2019ve been something from the start to explain to her that she\u2019s grown and should contribute. Carrying it on left her feeling entitled enough to bring someone else too. My question is who tf did she think was paying at the end of the night and how the fuck does she not feel guilty for using you guys basically to be honest.

It\u2019s someone whose bad behavior is avoidable if you know about it, so instead of addressing the behavior head-on, many groups just warn new people \u201cdon\u2019t let X do <whatever> with you\u201d.\n\nHence the metaphor of a missing stair - you can safely step over it if you know it\u2019s there.", ">And it\u2019s yet another thing to do this EVERY.
