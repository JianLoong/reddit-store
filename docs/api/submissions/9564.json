Everyday for the past month, my wife has been at her mom\u2019s house, helping with drains and keeping her company.  Leaving me with the 3 kids while I work from home for most of the day, everyday.  \n\nI\u2019ve been more or less ok with this arrangement.  But it slowly and gradually became more and more of a strain on me.  And it doesn\u2019t help that my wife\u2019s father and siblings could help out more\u2026 but they simply don\u2019t.\n\nSo it all came to a head yesterday.  My wife went and got her hair done.  I\u2019m ok with that.  She hasn\u2019t had her hair done in a long time and she deserves a little time off.  But then after the appointment, my wife called and said her mom needed a car ride to the doctor.  My wife asked if I could stay with the kids a few more hours and pick up the oldest from school as well.\n\nMe: Ok\u2026 where is the doctor?  \n\nHer:  A couple blocks down the street.  \n\nMe:  Why can\u2019t her husband take her?  \n\nHer:  Because he is picking up a grandkid from school.  \n\nMe:  So what was her plan to get to the doctor?  \n\nHer: She was going to drive herself.\n\nMe:  And why can\u2019t she drive herself?\n\nHer:  She can, but she really shouldn\u2019t be driving until 6 weeks after the surgery.\n\nThis is where I got a little pissed (didn\u2019t help the kids were screaming in the background the whole time): I\u2019ve been home alone all day with the kids while working this entire time.  This whole thing is getting a little too crazy.  If she said she can drive, and her own husband doesn\u2019t want to drive her, then she can drive herself.\n\nHer:  Fine.

Her mother has a husband who made vows to support his wife in sickness and in health.\n\nIt is not your wife\u2019s responsibility to be caretaker for her mother while neglecting her commitments to you and the children.  Your children are being neglected because you can\u2019t give them the attention that they need because you have to work to earn a living to pay for every thing.\n\nIf your wife wants to be caregiver to her mother, she can, but she needs to take the kids with her, as you need to work to earn the money that funds your family.  She is being completely unreasonable with what she has been doing for a month now.

I have no idea how you're doing it with 3 kids under 6.  MIL has other people that help with her as well - they just don't want to and that is not good enough.

Took me about 2 months after abdominal surgery to be a safe driver. To have driven before, beside the health risk of bursting stitches, is it invalidates your insurance. So your wife was right to drive her in this limited circumstance. More generally, your wife is doing a really necessary job maintaining the drains and helping your MiL.\n\nBut you're working a F/T job and carrying the bulk of the childcare. That is an awful lot and it is understandable you are getting overwhelmed. So no, you are not a AH for raising it. And the silent treatment from your wife is unfair. You need to sit down and discuss how to cope with these competing demands. \n\nAs for her other relatives, they are AHs if not stepping up. But if they don't, they don't. Your focus should be on your own relationship and best way to support you, your wife, your children and MiL. Try local services - a nurse coming in to check drains even a few times a week will help or consider a child minder just to get over this hump.", "Absolutely NTA. I\u2019m a SAHP and my spouse works from home.\n\nYou cannot effectively work from home while also caring for children-especially three kids under age 6! I could understand once in a while or if her mom was having an actual emergency, but what your wife is doing is pretty disrespectful to her own family. Something had to give, and it\u2019s either your job or the kids, neither of which is acceptable. Her mom needs to deal with her own life and understand your wife isn\u2019t available to help while she\u2019s caring for her kids.", "Having had major surgeries and worked from home, NTA. I am making the assumption that since insurance didn't send a home care nurse to MIL, that generally speaking, her household can handle things.\n\nI can see your wife being gone an hour or so a day to maybe drop off prepped meals or give a hand, but going all day while you try to work is unsustainable. Many companies would either force you into an office or fire you if you cannot keep up, which you can't if watching young children.", "Damn you seem really inconvenienced by this temporary change while your MIL recovers from *major surgery* and needed a bit more support.

YTA", "Info: so, when your wife is usually home with the kids, is she only watching them? Or does she do other things while she's watching them?", "NTA. Your kids are yours and your wife's shared responsibility. She's abdicating to make her mother her responsibility.

Just because she was willing to go against the doctor\u2019s orders doesn\u2019t mean she should. I\u2019ve helped a parent recover from major surgery and it\u2019s hard work. My mom, sister and I all divided the responsibilities of caring. For my dad and we were still overwhelmed. I understand that you\u2019re also overwhelmed by taking care of the kids while you\u2019re working but you can\u2019t ask your wife to just ditch her mom only a month after major surgery.

Sounds like she\u2019s days short of the 6 week rule, and it\u2019s only a few blocks, so probably could have done it herself or walked, but to finally show your (understandable) exasperation at this one moment is a drag and not a good look.", "I'm going to say ESH.  You've both had a month to sit down with each other and come up with a plan that would both help her mom while still taking  care of the kids. I agree that you can't be expected to watch the kids while you are working, but I feel like you are leaving things out too.

Time to come home lady", " YTA.\n\nSorry that family comes with this sort of inconvenience for you, but that's reality.\n\nYour wife is picking up the slack because her father and siblings are shit.", "Right?

There needs to be WAY more communication regarding scheduling and availability.", "[removed]", "Are expected to pull a day shift in daycare so she can do her thing.", "Is your MIL up for seeing her grandchildren while your wife is keeping her company?

Plus being the month of January, it seemed like at least one kid was constantly sick.", "Gotcha! Completely understandable, I wouldn't want to risk passing a cold to a person who is actively recovering.", "It\u2019s irresponsible when you have a wife in recovery at home who has appointments to get to and can\u2019t drive herself yet. He vowed in sickness and in health to his wife. \n\nThere have been times I\u2019ve asked my parents if they could watch my kids briefly for me and they\u2019ve said no because they have commitments elsewhere. That\u2019s ok and I adjust my plans and appointments to take care of my own kids.", "What if the parents can\u2019t find someone else to pick the kids up? You don\u2019t know the situation. Some people don\u2019t have the luxury of not needing to depend on family to help them.", "If the mother is reliant on OP\u2019s wife to this extent and has nobody else, then she should be planning her appointments around OP\u2019s family life. It\u2019s unsustainable for someone to be a full time parent to three kids under 6 and work full time too. OP\u2019s job is the only thing keeping this family afloat. There needs to be more respect for his contributions and less taking advantage.\n\nOP\u2019s wife can be there for her mother, but boundaries are important as well. It is ok for her to not be able to do everything for her mum.", "News flash: most doctors only take appointments during the work day. Why do you think so many people have to take time off work to go to the doctor? Also saying that OP\u2019s job is the only thing keeping the family afloat is an insult to SAHPs. They have three kids under 6. Do you think life would be more comfortable in their home if OP\u2019s wife had a full time or even part time job? OP and his wife are both contributing equally to their household. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not easy for her to take care of her mom during the day and come home and take care of the kids and manage that either household responsibilities at night. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s out getting manis and pedis with her mom. Being a caregiver is work", "NTA. I\u2019m a stay at home mom and my husband works from home 2 days a week. I\u2019m also pregnant and he watches our toddler when I have to go to the doctor (every 2 weeks now). I can absolutely tell how hard it is for him to watch our toddler and get work done at the same time. It\u2019s almost impossible sometimes. You are providing for your family, so you need to have time to focus on your job. Her other family members can help. It\u2019s not fair on your family unit to suffer because of it.", "NTA. Just because you\u2019re at home when you\u2019re working doesn\u2019t mean you can neglect your work and take care of the kids. Your job pays the bills. Sure the wife needs a break and to do her own thing, but not at the expense of your livelihood. It seems like she taking advantage of you, and she\u2019s mad because you put your foot down.", "NTA\n\nBut there's also a lot on your wife's plate as well a yours. Maybe suggest that you guys have set hours... where she looks after the kids and you focus on getting major tasks done, and then you take over the kids and she helps her parents.

She thinks your workday (owning a business, supporting your family) is negotiable. It isn't. \n\nYou should stamp this completely out with your marriage being at stake.", "NTA. Aside from the big picture that your wife and her family should be doing more, she expects you to haul three kids under 6 in a car to take a 5 minute drive?", "Or FIL can take his wife to the doctor a little early, go pick the kid up, and go back for his wife when she's done there. They can solve it without OPs wife.", "Nailed it!! \n\nAnd the brothers need to be held accountable to contribute to their mother\u2019s care instead of continuing to rely on their father for kid\u2019s transportation! I suspect it\u2019s good old fashioned misogyny where they just assume the daughter will take care of it bc that\u2019s what women are supposed to do. I am sympathetic to everyone in this situation except the slacker siblings", "This \u2b06\ufe0f", "Seriously. Move that \u201cwork from home\u201d to \u201cwork from Panera\u201d.

Maybe her brother or her father should be doing this stuff, but if they aren\u2019t then that isn\u2019t a solution to this problem because the mother needs care", "I also wondered this. Why does your wife not take the kids with her to go to her mother?", "I\u2019m a SAHP with three kids under 6 myself.\n\nMy husband couldn\u2019t do his job effectively without me doing my job. I can\u2019t do my job effectively if I\u2019m elsewhere. It\u2019s the same for OP and his wife. None of us live in a post-currency utopia. Money keeps the family afloat. If his business collapsed tomorrow, her caring for the children isn\u2019t going to pay the bills and keep a roof over their heads. Family life is collaborative. If one person is juggling everything while the other person expends themselves outside the family, that leads to burn out. He has taken on all of her responsibilities on top of his own, that\u2019s not sustainable for long.\n\nNo, she doesn\u2019t need to go out and get a paid job for the sake of it. But she should be doing her job as a SAHP so OP can focus on his. You can\u2019t pour from an empty cup. Sometimes the kindest thing is to be honest about your limitations - \u201cI can help you Mon, Wed and Fri between 9:30 and 1.\u201d It gives the mother an idea of when she could schedule her appointments and get assistance to get there.\n\nYes, doctors only do appointments in the daytime, but that gives a good chunk of time to organise things so there is no clash with school pick up times. I\u2019ve had to make appointments myself and make sure I get back in time to pick up my child from school. What\u2019s stopping FIL from doing this for his wife? He\u2019s the one who made vows in sickness and in health to his wife.", "Your wife was taking advantage of her mothers surgery to stick you with the kids .. I don\u2019t blame you for getting upset", "NTA,\nSo you are the breadwinner, took extra parenting role while your wife helps her mom with much needed care. Then she gets angry and stonewall you after you let her know you can't drive her mom. No, someone dropped the ball on the communication department, and she should not be blaming you for this.", "NTA. I will say you should have discussed this before blowing up, though.", "This isn't about scheduling. This is about the wife finding an easy way to skip out on work, which is childcare in this case.", "I think it's neat how many people believe being a stay at home mom isn't work.", "Um... I don't think the siblings are slackers at all. Having grandpa (or possibly it is usually grandma) pick up the kids from school is probably a long standing arrangement, or they just needed a favor, nothing wrong with that. But the siblings probably have a little thing called jobs. Why would they leave their jobs to take care of a woman who really does not even need care. OP said it is more about keeping her company all day. That is not the siblings job when they have jobs and probably families of their own. My husband had open heart surgery recently. I could have easily left him all day to go to work. Unless a person is bed ridden they do not need someone there with them 24/7", "Okay, so this is telling on myself.  I have 4 kids (20, 18, 15, 13).  As you can see not that far apart.  I was barely getting over post-partum depression (which I barely knew anything about) and bam!! PREGNANT HORMONES, again, lol.  I say this to say that anxiety and depression got really bad.  I was having a hard time keeping up with the house.  I always made sure kids were fed, clothed, but cooking evening dinners and keeping up with the house that fell on my husband who was also working.  Before anyone asks, no I am not proud of this.  Well my mom started getting in a bad way health wise and my sister wouldn't help her, so Mom kept asking if I would come over and help clean her house.  I would do this every week, but not doing mine.  This happened a few times and my husband had to lovingly, but sternly set me straight.  And I don't blame him for doing that.  He understood mental health, but if I was capable to help mom, then I needed to help him.  It isn't wrong to be feeling burnt out and needing help from the wife.", "NTA and neither is your wife. The thing is she always takes over helping out so her family just assumes she will continue to do so. This makes your wife feel guilty so she continues to do it. Then she never gets a break and she\u2019s taking care of her kids and her mom. It\u2019s exhausting and it\u2019s an extremely common issue. Your wife needs to set boundaries with her family around how much she can reasonably do and they need to step up. Maybe make a schedule or something so it\u2019s not all on her.", "NAH\n\nShe wants to take care of her parent after a surgery, and you mentioned in a comment one of your children was somewhat sick all of January, so you can't really bring the kids around the person recovering from surgery.\n\nYou were put into a position where you were expected to work from home while also having three kids to take care of. Understandable that you would want some additional assistance.\n\nI think a sit down conversation about the situation would have been more appropriate than trying to get her to change her scedule the day of, with little warning. No one likes making a plan for the day (\"I'm gonna be with mom, take her to the doctor and back, then head home\") and having that derailed.\n\nSo yeah... no AH here. Everyone's actions seem pretty understandable and justified. And I really don't think her wanting to take care of her mom-post surgery makes her an AH, even if it shouldn't be her responsibility and the husband should step up and help.", "NAH. You are in the right and it\u2019s totally understandable but it\u2019s also understandable that your wife wants to help her mother. Maybe you can apologize for not being communicative sooner about feeling burnt out. Do not apologize for being burnt out from trying to do two full time jobs at once but apologize for bottling it up and not telling your wife sooner that you need help and this situation isn\u2019t working. I\u2019m sure your wife has been scared about her mom - if there are drains involved I bet it\u2019s a pretty scary surgery where she is afraid she might lose her mom or came close. She unfortunately was not paying attention to your feelings and needs though", "NTA, it's not OK for her to expect you to do her job and your own instead of making the other family members step up!", "NTA. You need help with the kids too.", "You need to have a talk with your wife and let her know that as you are WFH, you cannot be as productive with caring for the kids too. If you continue like this, you won\u2019t have a job for long. Does she want a jobless husband? She has done her part in taking care of the mom. She should let her siblings do their part too.", "NTA", "NTA!", "YTA for not talking about it until you lost your temper on your wife and insisted her mom drive herself. If she isn\u2019t supposed to drive for medical reasons, then your short-term demand created a risk having complications or a delayed recovery. And you made it a lot harder to ask that you and your wife sit down and figure out a plan that worked better for your family like sensible adults would.\n\nAlso if the oldest is in school, she\u2019s not leaving you with three kids most of the day.", "NTA, she's cheating on you.", "You say you help with the kids while working from home; that\u2019s not the same as being the SAH primary caregiver, as you\u2019ve seen the past few weeks.", "RSV season.", "He said it in the comments. I was just correcting the assumption that he had an employer, because I thought the same thing, until I saw his comments that he was self-employed. Not sure why I\u2019d be downvoted for providing information in a non-judgmental way.", "Yeah, doing it on top of his job. Wife does it without a job.", "She\u2019s the primary caregiver then and it\u2019s not entirely accurate for him to say he\u2019s been a SAHD, when he\u2019s working", "If she is spending all day at her moms for the last month don\u2019t see how she is the primary care giver. Per OP they split duties with her taking on a little more when he is working from his laptop running the business.", "Because the kids are 1, 3, and 5 and her mom has only needed help for a few weeks."]}
