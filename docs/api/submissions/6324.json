{"id": 6324, "submission_id": "101ptso", "title": "AITA for thinking my MOH should spend the day before my wedding with me?", "selftext": "I'm new to Reddit. My FBIL suggested I post here.\n\nMy (33f) fianc\u00e9 (29m) are getting married in August. We happen to share the same birthday, and our wedding is the day after. My MOH (B, 25f) also has the same birthday as us.\n\nSo for the day before the wedding, I had suggested to Bex that she join us (mine and fianc\u00e9's family) for lunch and then help me to prepare for my wedding day. I also asked that she share a hotel room with me the night before, so she can be there for me the moment I wake up, to support and calm me. She agreed to stay in the hotel with me but was a bit vague about agreeing to lunch, as she said she didn't know if she would have plans. (This was a few weeks ago.)\n\nSkip to today and Bex's husband (Lee) messages me to say that he's organised a romantic day out for Bex's birthday, ending with a concert. He told me that it was going to be a surprise for her, so he was letting me know in advance so that I could plan for her absense the day before the wedding.\n\nI will admit that I became sharp with Lee. I told him it was inconsiderate of him to book something for Bex the day before my wedding when he knew she had responsibilities. Lee told me I was a \"crazy bridezilla\" if I thought I was going to make Bex do \"slave labour\" on her birthday. (Bex is really good at organising, and she loves to help. I don't think she'd see it that way.) Lee did say that if Bex still wanted to come back to my hotel room after the concert that he wouldn't stop her, but that I absolutely cannot have her during the day.\n\nI went to one of my bridesmaids, Val 29f, and she agreed with Lee that I obviously have to let Bex go off and enjoy her birthday. I told Val I was annoyed that Lee hadn't even asked me if I could spare Bex, he had just told me she wasn't going to be available. I also told her that Lee hadn't even offered me his concert ticket, so that Bex, my MOH and I could have a fun evening together the day before my wedding. \n\nShe told someone what I said and now I'm getting hateful messages from my other bridesmaid and friends saying I can't behave that way. \n\nAll I want is to spend the day before my wedding with my MOH, am I really the asshole?\n\nTLDR: I want to spend the day before my wedding with my MOH but my MOH's husband wants to take her out for her birthday. AITA?\n\nI'll add that I don't know if Bex knows yet. She's organised so much for me, so I think that she would help me if I asked her.\n\nEdit: For everyone asking why I'm relying on Bex so much, it's because my fianc\u00e9 hasn't been much help during thr whole process so I obviously need someone to lean on and talk to about my vision for the day.\n\nEdit 2: I can't afford a wedding planner.", "created_utc": 1672698532, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/101ptso/aita_for_thinking_my_moh_should_spend_the_day/", "score": 2283, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My FBIL suggested I post here.\n\nMy (33f) fianc\u00e9 (29m) are getting married in August. We happen to share the same birthday, and our wedding is the day after. My MOH (B, 25f) also has the same birthday as us.\n\nSo for the day before the wedding, I had suggested to B that she join us (mine and fianc\u00e9's family) for lunch and then help me to prepare for my wedding day. I also asked that she share a hotel room with me the night before, so she can be there for me the moment I wake up, to support and calm me. She agreed to stay in the hotel with me but was a bit vague about agreeing to lunch, as she said she didn't know if she would have plans. (This was a few weeks ago.)\n\nSkip to today and B''s husband (L) messages me to say that he's organised a romantic day out for B's birthday, ending with a concert. He told me that it was going to be a surprise for her, so he was letting me know in advance so that I could plan for her absense the day before the wedding.\n\nI will admit that I became sharp with L. I told him it was inconsiderate of him to book something for B the day before my wedding when he knew she had responsibilities. L told me I was a \"crazy bridezilla\" if I thought I was going to make B do \"slave labour\" on her birthday. (B is really good at organising, and she loves to help. I don't think she'd see it that way.) L did say that if B still wanted to come back to my hotel room after the concert that he wouldn't stop her, but that I absolutely cannot have her during the day.\n\nI went to one of my bridesmaids, V 29f, and she agreed with L that I obviously have to let B go off and enjoy her birthday. I told V I was annoyed that L hadn't even asked me if I could spare B, he had just told me she wasn't going to be available. I also told her that L hadn't even offered me his concert ticket, so that B, my MOH and I could have a fun evening together the day before my wedding. \n\nShe told someone what I said and now I'm getting hateful messages from my other bridesmaid and friends saying I can't behave that way. \n\nAll I want is to spend the day before my wedding with my MOH, am I really the asshole?\n\nTLDR: I want to spend the day before my wedding with my MOH but my MOH's husband wants to take her out for her birthday. AITA?\n\nI'll add that I don't know if B knows yet. She's organised so much for me, so I think that she would help me if I asked her.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You are not entitled to her time in the way that you feel you are. If you push this issue, you will likely not have a friend the end of your wedding. She deserves to have the beautiful day that her husband has planned for HER special day, and this will not majorly affect YOUR special day. \n\nAlso, it sounds like your fianc\u00e9 should be participating in at least a minimal amount, otherwise you wouldn't need her to plan everything as well cling to her for your \"emotional support\".

Your fianc\u00e9 probably has not been helping much and using the man excuse because it sounds like you\u2019re a total nightmare.

It's disgraceful that that you snapped at her partner for wanting to give her a special birthday. It's not on your wedding day, and her birthday would still matter even if they coincided.\n\nBased on your comments you're unhappy with a lot and hyperfocusing on the wedding.
