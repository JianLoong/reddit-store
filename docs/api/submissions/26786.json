This will be the first grandchild for my parents, my FIL, and the first great grandchild for my grandparents. We live 4 hours away from all our family except my grandparents.\n\nI am planning a low intervention and low personell labor as having a bunch of people in and out would cause me a lot of stress which could slow labor. Because of this, I've only asked my mom and my spouse to be my birthing partners with no one else invited to the hospital for emotional and health/safety reasons.\n\nMy mom said she will run errands so my spouse need not leave my side, take over primary support when he needs a break, and offer coping suggestions. Essentially a doula who is also my best friend. She will then stay in the area for a few days to help with chores and meals so my hubby and I can focus on recovering and bonding with baby. \n\nSome say it's unfair to have my mom in the labor room but not MIL, but I'm not inviting people into my most vulnerable time just to be polite. I need my mom for support, where my MIL will only add stress for me. I love her, but she is very opinionated and likes to voice those opinions whenever the urge strikes. I don't think I need that kind of thing when I'm trying to push a baby out my \ud83d\ude3a unmedicated. \n\nBesides flu season, my midwife has advised we not let anyone without a current TDAP vaccine hold the baby for the first three months as whooping cough in newborns is a big issue in our area. My MIL is very against vaccines (and masks) and I know it would be hard-impossible to expect her to make the long drive to visit but not hold baby. Especially if we let someone else hold baby and not her. In the interest of fairness we've decided not to let anyone hold baby for the first two weeks to give his immune system a little chance to develop. We've asked all family to wait and not visit for a couple weeks because why make a long drive just to not be allowed to hold or touch the baby? We won't stick to the full 3 months of no contact that was recommended, but do want to at least keep it very low contact with hand washing until baby can get their own vaccinations at 3 months. \n\nMy MIL called to tell me she's upset that we don't want her there for the birth or first week. We explained that it was based off our midwife's advice and that we were asking all family to wait a little bit before making the trek down, not just her. She said the baby will have natural immunity and that she considers herself low risk for passing along any illness. I told her we want her involved and to be able to see the baby ASAP, but that our midwife has advised caution for this time of year. I said we could video call soon after birth so she can see him almost immediately, but she is still upset and wants to hold the baby sooner. \n\nSo AITAH for standing my ground and telling her we really didn't want any visitors for at least a week or two?", "created_utc": 1694621790, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16hradk/aitah_for_not_letting_my_mil_come_to_the_hospital/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He supports me and says he understands my decision, but he's not as passionate about it as I am. Understandable that he has different beliefs on how much caution is too much as he was raised by different people than I was. Maybe showing him some more statistics or videos on babies who get whooping cough or rsv would be a good idea just to make him see that my \"over caution\" is justified.

I've asked him to take care of all further correspondence with her about this issue. \n\nI don't expect her to respect all our wishes when she comes. Husband says she will but I'm not so sure.

I'm less worried about her feelings than I am about my husband's, but even so I would never forgive myself if baby actually got sick. I'm doing my best, but I'm new to enforcing boundaries, I'm very sensitive and cry easy because of hormones, and MIL is very pushy. I need to just get my husband to understand how serious this is, and then make him handle all further correspondence with his mom. I really shouldn't have to take all the heat and blame from her for this decision when it's coming from both me and her son and is in the baby's best interest.", "I\u2019m just going to throw this out there: her temper tantrum is not your business or your problem. Learn to take control now, or accept that this will be just the beginning of problems with her manipulating to get her way. \n\nYou are the mom now. You decide. Why is she getting special treatment without any compromise from her end? You\u2019re giving her the CHOICE to get vaccinated and get similar treatment to come meet baby (NOT taking about being present for birth or at the hospital), and if she CHOOSES to not get vaccinated or mask, then that\u2019s her decision and she will have to deal with the pre-determined outcome of not meeting or holding baby for a while. \n\nTell your DH to grow a spine. Why are you prioritizing the feelings of your MIL and your DH over what you believe is the safety of your newborn baby? You also can\u2019t expect him to suddenly stand up to her when you\u2019re not standing up to him. Just sayin\u2026 \n\nAnd as for birth, that\u2019s by invitation only. And I mean the person giving birth is the ONLY one who approves and extends invites. He\u2019s mad? Remind him that HE HIMSELF also must be invited by the person giving birth. She\u2019s mad? Oh well. When it\u2019s her son naked on the table pushing a human out of his body for hours he can invite the entire country if he wants. Not his medical procedure? Well, then he doesn\u2019t get a vote. Good grief. He can control the guest list for his next colonostomy.", "Tell her it isn't an option! She can wear a simple mask if her love runs so deeply for her recently born and defenseless grandchild.", "Have your doctor tell him."]}
