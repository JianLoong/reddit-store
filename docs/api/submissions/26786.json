This will be the first grandchild for my parents, my FIL, and the first great grandchild for my grandparents. We live 4 hours away from all our family except my grandparents.\n\nI am planning a low intervention and low personell labor as having a bunch of people in and out would cause me a lot of stress which could slow labor. Because of this, I've only asked my mom and my spouse to be my birthing partners with no one else invited to the hospital for emotional and health/safety reasons.\n\nMy mom said she will run errands so my spouse need not leave my side, take over primary support when he needs a break, and offer coping suggestions. Essentially a doula who is also my best friend. She will then stay in the area for a few days to help with chores and meals so my hubby and I can focus on recovering and bonding with baby. \n\nSome say it's unfair to have my mom in the labor room but not MIL, but I'm not inviting people into my most vulnerable time just to be polite. I need my mom for support, where my MIL will only add stress for me. I love her, but she is very opinionated and likes to voice those opinions whenever the urge strikes. I don't think I need that kind of thing when I'm trying to push a baby out my \ud83d\ude3a unmedicated. \n\nBesides flu season, my midwife has advised we not let anyone without a current TDAP vaccine hold the baby for the first three months as whooping cough in newborns is a big issue in our area. My MIL is very against vaccines (and masks) and I know it would be hard-impossible to expect her to make the long drive to visit but not hold baby. Especially if we let someone else hold baby and not her. In the interest of fairness we've decided not to let anyone hold baby for the first two weeks to give his immune system a little chance to develop. We've asked all family to wait and not visit for a couple weeks because why make a long drive just to not be allowed to hold or touch the baby? We won't stick to the full 3 months of no contact that was recommended, but do want to at least keep it very low contact with hand washing until baby can get their own vaccinations at 3 months. \n\nMy MIL called to tell me she's upset that we don't want her there for the birth or first week. We explained that it was based off our midwife's advice and that we were asking all family to wait a little bit before making the trek down, not just her. She said the baby will have natural immunity and that she considers herself low risk for passing along any illness. I told her we want her involved and to be able to see the baby ASAP, but that our midwife has advised caution for this time of year. I said we could video call soon after birth so she can see him almost immediately, but she is still upset and wants to hold the baby sooner. \n\nSo AITAH for standing my ground and telling her we really didn't want any visitors for at least a week or two?", "created_utc": 1694621790, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16hradk/aitah_for_not_letting_my_mil_come_to_the_hospital/", "score": 258, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He supports me and says he understands my decision, but he's not as passionate about it as I am. Understandable that he has different beliefs on how much caution is too much as he was raised by different people than I was. Maybe showing him some more statistics or videos on babies who get whooping cough or rsv would be a good idea just to make him see that my \"over caution\" is justified.

I'm less worried about her feelings than I am about my husband's, but even so I would never forgive myself if baby actually got sick. I'm doing my best, but I'm new to enforcing boundaries, I'm very sensitive and cry easy because of hormones, and MIL is very pushy.

He's breastfed so I know he was getting antibodies from me and once he started his own vaccines (and at that time cold/flu/RSV season was over) people could hold him after washing their hands. We still try to practice good hand higene of course but we're less militant about it now that he's 8 months.

But he was there when his baby sister got sick so he doesn\u2019t take that stuff lightly.\n\nIt\u2019s just crazy when people have different beliefs about illness.", "Unforgivable.", "My mom put my then just turned two year old at risk for COVID two years ago when he was too young for the vaccine. She didn\u2019t follow isolation timeline prior to getting a test and therefore got it from my niblings and the second test she took after staying away from them for the few days she needed to turned positive before she came to visit us but didn\u2019t have the accurate test result back until she was already here. I still haven\u2019t forgiven her for not following basic precautions to keep him safe and her actions after that. \n\nPeople who can be so selfish and cavalier about a baby/young child\u2019s health suck.", "Oh, god, yes. I forgot about that one", "Poignant comment right there.", "I met someone recovering from whooping cough. And despite being in recovery and no longer contagious, she sounded so terrible and in so much pain from each whistling gasp for air.", "Im sorry your MILs fragile ego is more important than your child\u2019s health \u2639\ufe0f", "When, exactly, are you planning to tell your husband it's time to put you and your baby before his mommy?  \n\nI recommend today.  His priority needs to be the family **you two** are building, not his mommy's science-denying, anti-vaxx...stuff.  Stop using things like \"they live too far away\" as justification for keeping your own mouth shut.  It's ridiculous and a false flag.  Determined grannies be determined.  Stick your guns on the 3 month rule if she continues to refuse to get her TDaP.  Who cares that everyone else will get to see/hold the baby first?  **YOUR BABY, YOUR RULES.**\n\nYour husband needs to grow a spine, and so do you.  Stop letting him off the damn hook.", "If MIL can't conform  then she can wait. My niece lost her 5 mo old firstborn to sids and she and her husband were completely shattered and the whole family was heartbroken. Trust me! I was the first extended family to see her and you have no idea how awful that was. I will never forget holding her as she fell apart. Just the make her happy is wrong. Keep those boundaries and don't budge. Protect your precious baby.", "Ooof. \n\nOk mama, here\u2019s the thing: you need to be as tough and firm in your opinions as your MIL. She gets away with it because she\u2019s the mom, right? Well now, so are you. Stop kowtowing. Be strong.", "And this is why you need to follow the rules the Dr\u2019s/nurses/doula give to you. \n\nMy daughter who was got pertussis as an infant?\u2026 she is 10 now and even still, anytime she gets a cold, it goes STRAIGHT into her chest and gets a cough that sounds like croup. \n\nPlease listen to the advice people are giving you. My adult son and DIL didn\u2019t let anyone around my grandson without a mask (her family wouldn\u2019t vaccinate either - so they either masked and washed hands or they didn\u2019t hold him) or vaccinations. Her family threatened all kinds of things but they wanted to be around baby, so all but one gave in. And the one that didn\u2019t eventually did because she felt left out and was testing boundaries.", "YTA and so is your husband. Plain and simple, you're putting g the safety of you child behind the comfort and ease of yourselves and his mother. What happens if she doesn't think a booster seat is necessary, or cutting grapes into smaller pieces to reduce choking hazards? What happens when she thinks it's ok to give your child a bit of booze to help with their cough or that  using racial slurs in front of the child is ok? All of these may never happen, but they could. Are you never going to stick to rules to keep your child safe just because it may further upset your husband's mother? Part of.being a good parent is fighting when something isn't right, get off to a good start with this because it doesn't sound like you're on the right track.", "Your baby cannot speak for themselves. You and your husband are the only voice they have, it is your duty to use your voice to protect them, not other peoples feelings. \n\n2 weeks you\u2019ll still be recovering, and forget whooping cough, even a regular cold can kill a newborn. Baby gets a fever that young, it\u2019s standard to give them spinal taps to make sure they don\u2019t have meningitis. \n\nEither you or him should tell her \u201cour child\u2019s safety is our number one priority. We will not be doing anything that will risk baby\u2019s best interest.\u201d And if she gets upset, too bad, better her upset than your baby (or yourself while you\u2019re recovering!) sick. \n\nBecoming a mom gave be a backbone of steel. I used to be such a pushover and people pleaser. Not now. Never will I bend to someone\u2019s desires if it\u2019s not what\u2019s best for my child.", "Be blunt: she could kill the baby. That\u2019s not hyperbolic - RSV, the flu, COVID, whooping cough, and other things regularly kill newborns who are infected. Your husband is placing his mother\u2019s feelings over the safety of your child.", "You really need to ask your husband, \u201cso, if the baby gets whooping cough, will you ever forgive yourself?   I won\u2019t forgive you\u201d.   Also Covid and flu shots.", "you need to sit down with your husband and do some real research on the risks of exposing your child to unvaccinated people before their immune system has had a chance to develop and they\u2019ve had their first round of vaccines. he needs to understand exactly what he\u2019s risking by insisting on this.\n\nyour baby\u2019s immune system won\u2019t care that it\u2019s their grandma, or that her feelings might be hurt. you are both unnecessarily risking your child\u2019s LIFE to placate a woman who seems to have chronic meltdowns when things don\u2019t go her way. you need to stand up for your baby\u2019s health and safety and draw a hard line \u2014 vaccination, or wait the 3 months. \n\ngood luck, OP.", "The boundary thing feels pretty hard at first but you're going to have to do it a lot, both with this MIL and eventually with that darling baby child. Find some books or online articles about how to create and stand firm with boundaries, maybe get some friends lined up to text when you need support. It gets much easier with practice. I guarantee she will challenge and test your boundaries but just stay firm, she will get used to it eventually.", "You have resources to support you in this. Include your husband in direct talks with your healthcare providers. Urge him to ask questions. Help him see what you have learned.", "Babies can DIE of whooping cough. And it\u2019s a horrible, painful, exhausting illness for the ones who survive it. \n\nYour husband needs to educate himself better about this and hold a firm line with his mother.", "She's already chosen not to be respectful by throwing a fit about your boundaries instead of respecting them", "Stop making excuses. This is your child's future development. Say that to her. Over. And over. And over. Every time you make excuses, you diminish the importance of the conversation. Ask her why she wants to hurt her grandson.", "This is good to hear. However, I\u2019d bet money that she\u2019s going to get upset and push back no matter what the limit is. I\u2019d think about where and when you want that to happen, so you can prepare yourselves. Under the current plan, a lot of it may happen in person on her first visit, when she\u2019s holding your son and you or dh moves to take him away from her. Personally, I\u2019d probably choose for more conflict now, i.e. laying down the law harder now, long-distance, in hopes that less of it will play out later in person.", "That is if she\u2019ll let go of the baby. She sounds like the type who will refuse to hand him over before she\u2019s \u201chad her fair turn\u201d with him. Unless he\u2019s absolutely screaming, she\u2019s probably not going to fall for \u201che\u2019s hungry\u201d or anything else. Maybe get some fart spray and use that for a \u201cwhoops, smells like a dirty diaper!\u201d excuse but even then she probably won\u2019t be willingly giving you back the baby once she gets her hands on him. And kisses are fast, by the time you see her moving in to kiss him, it will be too late to stop her. Even without kissing, she\u2019ll probably have her face right up close to his while holding him which is just as bad. \n\nSit with your husband, show him videos of infants with respiratory illnesses, they are heartbreaking. Let him know that he can\u2019t take it back if his mom infects his child with something. Tell him now is the moment to stand up for his baby and lay down the rules. People get super selfish when there\u2019s a new baby and lie about feeling ill because they are so excited to meet the baby. She told you herself that she believes the baby will have natural immunity and that she believes she\u2019s low risk for passing along any illness. That should tell you all you need to know about how this is going to go down. She\u2019s one of the selfish ones and you can\u2019t trust her to be honest if she\u2019s sick, because she doesn\u2019t believe the baby will catch anything from her. Once she gets ahold of the child she\u2019s going to be covering his face in kisses and breathing all over him while talking to him. \n\nAnd I will say that I know firsthand how it sucks to not see the cute little baby you love. When my first nephew was a few months old, long before Covid btw, we had a family dinner for my dad\u2019s birthday planned. I woke up that day with a cold, the type where you\u2019d probably still go somewhere, just stay back a bit from everyone. But the baby would be there and I decided to cancel because I didn\u2019t want to risk his health. My sister thanked me later for setting the precedence that others followed when they got sick before family events. Put your foot down now. She can get vaccinated AND show you the evidence or wear a mask but she can\u2019t be around him until she agrees to an option or he gets his vaccines.", "Okay, not to be a jerk, but no wonder she acts like this. You both bow down to her! Stop it. \n\nYou want to be treated like baby\u2019s parents and you want the rules to come from you? Then act like it. And take all of the responsibility that comes with it. Welcome to the unspoken \u201chard\u201d of parenting. Learn to give less f\u2019s what other people think because they had to deal with the consequences of their own actions. \n\nYou can\u2019t \u201cwish\u201d her into compliance. Your husband CANNOT guarantee her behavior or compliance. Quite frankly you\u2019re setting yourself (and more importantly possibly your babys health) up for failure by not addressing this directly and immediately. You mention in your comments that you\u2019d still let her hold baby and would take her away if she\u2019s about to sneeze.  \ud83d\ude44  I\u2019ve got news for you, she sounds like one of those MILs who\u2019s going to take baby out of your arms, and also walk away with baby, not to mention not giving baby back when you ever so politely try to find an excuse to take baby back. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine what she has planned to take over  your postpartum, future holidays, and other events with your baby in the future. Good luck.", "Your husband needs to pull his socks up. He\u2019s not the one with their body on the line. He won\u2019t experience your pain of gestating and birthing your baby. Or the aftermath of taking a dump for 40 minutes or the near constant bleeding and needing to wear a diaper. He won\u2019t have nipple chaffing. \n\nYou haven\u2019t worked this hard to produce a little person, just for it to all be taken away by MIL deciding that she can\u2019t wear a mask or get a shot. \n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, your wants and needs trump absolutely everyone else\u2019s. Your husband can have an opinion, but you\u2019re the one with the most to lose here, so don\u2019t back down.", "Others have mentioned youtube videos of babies with whooping cough. Find them and SHOW YOUR HUSBAND. Make him sit there and watch them. Ask him if his mom's feelings matter more than your child quite possibly having to go through the same thing, just because his mom doesn't want to get a vaccine. A 30 second thing could save your baby from a PICU stay. It could save your baby from dying, and your husband is okay with NOT letting his mom come.\n\n2 weeks, be damned. Stick it out for the entire 3 months since she's being so stubborn and your hubby is being wishy-washy. \n\nI didn't get to see my youngest grandchild for 6 weeks, because they were premature, and even then I got to LOOK at them while my son held them. THAT is what a loving family member does. I care more about my family than I do about myself.", "I\u2019m defending the OP lol. You have a problem with defending a woman for not wanting to be forced to have someone in her medical procedure she doesn\u2019t want?", "Exactly. OP is going to be a parent. She should consider MIL\u2019s tantrums practice for the many she will have to deal with in the next couple of decades.", "Oh she's absolutely not babysitting. My husband and I agree 100% on that much. He knows that for her \"babysitting\" is doing her thing and letting the kid do his. His nephew is constantly falling down the stairs and getting hurt when she \"watches\" him. I do NOT trust her to be alone with baby.", "My friend's baby was exposed to a cold at 2-3 months old and ended up with viral meningitis and now he has a seizure disorder. It's definitely no joke.", "No, you're not, you are bashing her for posting \"useless information\". If it is useless, move on.", "Underrated comment. This won't be the last time, best to put your foot down firmly now.", "One of the most rage inducing sentences in the English language for me is \u201cit\u2019s just a cold\u201d because of babies like your friends. Because of my elderly family members. Because of my immunocompromised family members. And because of myself, every time I get a cold I end up with bronchitis because of my asthma. \n\nI hate when people don\u2019t take sickness seriously.", "It all is useless because the ONLY sentence that mattered is that she didn\u2019t want her MIL there. A woman should never have to justify (which is what she\u2019s doing) why she doesn\u2019t want someone at a delivery. It\u2019s not ok for anyone to judge on why she doesn\u2019t want someone at the delivery bc the only sentence that matters is\u2026I don\u2019t want them there.", "I'm not saying mil is right. No one forced you to read the  \"useless information\". Go rant somewhere else."]}
