But you set up the explanation a little differently, implying you did not think you should have to attend more events because you did not have a formal role in the wedding. That seems odd to me. Weddings rarely can honor all of the important people in a couple\u2019s lives, yet the significant others of those who do have a formal role are almost always included in these extra events. I\u2019m still picking up a vibe that you were generally salty about not being more formally included.", "So, no spouse or partner or whatever is generally \"specifically invited\" to that stuff. It's just expected that you two are a unit. Kind of like how you don't get your own wedding invitation mailed to you; you're both included in the one.

What do they expect you to do here?\n\nSeems like coming to the wedding, and bringing home toddler at a decent hour (you're WELCOME, literally every body else at the wedding - or did they want a melting down kid there?) *when you have to get up at 4am* is already super generous on your part, especially after the way they treat you?\n\nI just don't get what they expect you to do. This is pretty basic stuff.", "So what would you have done if you were asked to be in the wedding?\n\nAnd why does the title of your post have absolutely nothing to do with inability to take time off from work?", "My choice of wording was poor.

I\u2019m being told by my wife that I am not helping him down the aisle.", "Right but etiquette aside, OP *literally only has x-many hours they can take off work*. What are they supposed to do, jeopardize their employment? \n\nThey're already going to the wedding and at least part of the reception, even though they have to get up at 4am the next morning plus dealing with toddler bedtime, etc.\n\nYes, indeed, the etiquette is otherwise, but it doesn't preclude the basic limits of life??", "He\u2019s going to the wedding. Why is he obligated to be there an entire day? I\u2019ve been MOH many times. Never would I expect, or really want, my partner to just be hanging out while we\u2019re getting ready.", ">So you are saying he need to take 12 plus hours off work unpaid?", "I think there\u2019s a difference in etiquette between having to invite the SO to the wedding and expecting the SO to attend all the bridesmaid activities. \n\nLike, I know plenty of people who have all the bridesmaids get together to do hair and make up before the wedding. I don\u2019t know anyone who expects the bridesmaids\u2019 SOs to be there too. If the bridesmaids got together to help pick out the wedding dress, I doubt the SOs would tag along. Same for the bachelorette party.\n\nAlso, if one person in a married unit can\u2019t make the wedding, that doesn\u2019t uninvite the couple. Like, I\u2019d never tell someone whose spouse is out of town on a business trip that they\u2019re not allowed to attend a wedding without them. They can RSVP as individuals.\n\nSo, no, spouses are not assumed to act as a single unit in relation to a wedding. It\u2019s simply proper etiquette to invite them both.", "Yes that was left out so I can add some info here. There is no lack of parental guidance here, my mother is watching our son until I pick him up, take him to the venue, and get him in his tux.", "Fair enough, I'll edit.\n\nHowever, I do find it a bit too much of you to decide they don't like you because they didn't give you a role.

Were they expecting all guests to not have other activities going on outside of their wedding that day?

You\u2019re also the ah for skipping everything just to punish them because they didn\u2019t make THEIR wedding all about YOU.\n\nEDIT-Spelling", "ESH.\n\nDespite your claim to the contrary, your feelings are hurt. ESH because they haven't reached out to talk to you, you haven't reached out to talk to them. Y'all are grown. Use your words.", "I have no idea why they want to claim your time when they won't be using it? You asked at what time to be there and took enough time off to be there at that time. It almost looks like they're just looking for a reason to be pissed off at you. NTA.", "ESH. Not having a role in the wedding doesn't mean they don't like you. My sister and dad had roles and my mum didn't - I love my mum. But they can't be mad about you not attending events they didn't invite you to.", "YTA. I feel you have been looking for reasons to stick it to them. They aren\u2019t obligated to have you in the bridal party.  Did you even discuss this with your wife before you made this decision?", "NTA.  I'd put money on it that they intended for you to babysit and/or run errands.", "YTA.  There is obviously an entire weekend of events you were expected to participate in, and I don\u2019t believe the whole \u201cI\u2019m not upset I wasn\u2019t asked to play a role\u201d. You get two choices in life, be the bigger person or be a jerk.  Have you ever actually spoken to your SIL to break the ice or discuss your feelings?  The bride doesn\u2019t choose the groomsman, what role did you expect to play\u2026\u2026the salty brother in law?", "Oh I'm betting OP was expected to help corral the children of the wedding party, and that's why they are upset.", "OOP clearly isn\u2019t close to his SIL and her fianc\u00e9 if it had to be pointed out to him that they\u2019re ignoring him. \n\nI\u2019m side eyeing his wife. Why is she OK with her sister being rude to her husband? He specifically asked what time to be there and made arrangements to be there at that time. NTA", "He could have told them to f\\*\\*k off and he'd still be NTA.  SiL has earned that much, at least.  He was more polite to her than she deserved, frankly.", "I agree. They never indicated he needed to be there for anything besides noon for the Wedding. I am a little worried about the \u201c be there around noon\u201d part, but idk if that\u2019s actually an issue. I don\u2019t actually know what time the wedding is. If it\u2019s like 1-2pm then around noon is probably fine to show up with the ring bear", "And he asked when he should get there and they said noon...  NTA op", "They just want to blame the husband as they normally do. See the massive back and forth where OP lays out how his wife isn't having the kid dumped on her and how he is getting the kid ready? That is AITA hunting for a reason to dunk on him but failing.", "Right! I kind of laughed at this, then to follow it up \u201cthey consider me a brother and thought I would be there\u201d. Weird way to say we don\u2019t like you.", "/u/WarningZestyclose959 is a spammer!  **Do not click any links they share or reply to**.

He didn't acted upon them in any way. He don't need to reach out them because don't need to say anything to them.", "That\u2019s a good point. I thought it was they were mad at the lack of attention \u201cHow dare people not be 100 percent focused on my day\u201d", "SIL upset OP wont be there to just suck all the insults in the guise of I'm a happy bride, it's my effing day..", "I was at my SILs wedding recently where my wife was bridesmaid and my wife told me i'd be doing jobs for them, watching the kids and running errands that morning. No issue with that if its up front and known. But I suspect you're right that they just expected op to do this without any prior warning.", "Yes they're upset they're not getting their free labor. Boo freaking hoo", "Or run all sorts of other last-minute errands for the wedding party.", "This sub doesn\u2019t like when the OP is inconvenienced in the slightest, hence why you\u2019re downvoted so hard haha. But yes, if this is your wife\u2019s sister getting married, it\u2019s a little weird to not take the day off to attend it with her family. But again, this sub takes inconveniences highly seriously, even if this is an excellent way to show your in-laws how little you care about them.", "My thoughts exactly! NTA", "Not all people need to have their SO as emotional support whereever they go. Some of us can do activities completly independent from our SOs and not feel \"lonely\" or \"neglected\"  ;)", "Why would that matter to anyone other than his wife?  I go to stuff without my husband all the time.\n\nIt sounds like they feel like he\u2019s not making them his first priority.  And they shouldn\u2019t be his first priority", "And? I fail to see the problem. Rehearsal dinner is a ridiculous concept anyway. Everyone is just getting together to eat. There is no rehearsal anything about it. It\u2019s just a dinner. OP doesn\u2019t need to be there.", "What do you mean let her go alone? She has her sister there, and assuming other members of her family. She don't need her husband \"permission\" or  attandance to go to family events", "Isn\u2019t the rehearsal dinner typically for the wedding party?? I\u2019ve never been to one but thats what I assumed.", "Is his wife unable to do so things alone? Some people have to work for a living. OP has stated, multiple times, he didn\u2019t have enough PTO to take off for 3 days.", "He isn't expecting her to go alone or not alone, he just choose not to go. She doesn't need her hand holding in any of those events", "I know. I fail to see the nuclear option.  what part of his reaction of coming dressed appropriately, making sure the child's dressed appropriately, and getting everybody there at the time they were told to be there, huh I'm really confused by how that's the nuclear option.", "Nah they wanted a personal assistant to go grab things from the car, help hold this, run down to the local store and grab something etc", "Not really. They've made it clear they don't like him. Why should he rearrange his entire day for them? He's showing up to the wedding, that's enough", "Sorry, but if the bride and groom wanted *all* standard guests to be there 5+ hours before the wedding, would you still find that reasonable? Or would it be ridiculous to have guests arrive so early for zero reason?", "This is the part that's weirdest to me - how late do they expect a 3yo to stay? By taking him home, you're setting it up so your wife can participate more fully. Staying up late might work for some 3y on occasion, but for mine it would simply be a disaster. NTA.", "This is an incredibly reasonable explanation for your choices. I\u2019m sorry they\u2019re being awful to you, it sounds like they were going to treat you poorly no matter what you do.", "You said in your post it will cut into your PTO. not that you didn\u2019t have any. Which is it?", "Waiting for something and expecting for something isn't the same. He just took it as a possibility and waited to see if it happen (making plans to do in case it did, I assume)", "Ya, I\u2019m wondering how much of this sub has actually been to a wedding. Even if you\u2019re not directly in the wedding, spouses, aunts, uncles, grandmas are usually around for all the before activities as it\u2019s a social event.  Only showing up for the ceremony is a good way to show your in-laws just how much at arms reach/not apart of their family you want to be.", "Lmao nice work misrepresenting evidence.\n\n>Edit: For those who are downvoting, I recommend you check out some of the wedding reddits. There are plenty of brides over there asking some version of \u201cI don\u2019t like my maid of honor\u2019s fianc\u00e9/one of the groomsmen\u2019s wives/my sibling\u2019s SO, do I really have to invite them?\u201d and the answer is always yes, you do, couples are a package deal.\n\nPackage deal doesn't mean they have to arrive at the same time or be attached at the hip. As long as both are present at the actual function it is fine.", "How did they make that clear? They stated they were disappointed and considered him a brother\u2026 that\u2019s a weird way to \u201cmake it clear they don\u2019t like him\u201d lmao.", "Don\u2019t be sorry, I appreciate the question. I don\u2019t think anyone can define what a standard guest is. But, I\u2019ve always viewed it as you have family and the wedding party, then all other guests+extended family. Most weddings, the before wedding is treated as a social event, as a lot of family gather. Evidently, wife\u2019s family considered him family and thought he\u2019d be attending all the wedding festivities and he evidently does not include himself as part of the family/to be involved in all of the wedding festivities. Doesn\u2019t make him AH, but it certainly shows his wife\u2019s family how close he thinks he is to them.", "Probably would have taken un paid time off. But what\u2019s the point of taking unpaid time off when you have a young family and would just be sitting around twiddling your thumbs?", "Or it could be that he\u2019s emphasizing the point because he sees no reason to take unpaid time off for parts of a wedding he has no involvement in and his wife doesn\u2019t need him for?", ">I asked what time I had to be at the wedding and I was told noon.\n\nNot telling OP they'd love to have him for every part of the event maybe, on top of all the negative jokes throughout the years?", "The same SIL who likes to insult him and makes him feel unwelcome?", "Then maybe they should have made that clear and invited him to those events. Really shouldn't just assume.", "He asked what time he had to be at the wedding. They answered noon, it was at that point they should have clarified that they would also love if he could join for all the other events.", "There is zero reason he needs to be at extra meals to make anyone happy. Rehearsal dinner and wedding brunch? Are you serious? Yes, OP take unpaid time off to eat food because two people decided to get married. Do you not see how ridiculous that is?", "OP don't bother answering to that commenter. They are doing the typical AITA tactic of interrogating men who are NTA until they can find some small detail or thing they can use to shit on them. Notice how they keep hunting for something to suggest you are a bad husband? Don't bother"]}
