Because of this, I have always thought that she doesn\u2019t like me. I was waiting for her to possibly ask me to play some role in the wedding, since my wife is maid of honor and our only son is ring bearer.\n\nThe couple did not ask me to play a role in any way. I asked what time I had to be at the wedding and I was told noon. I work a 12 hour shift on the wedding day so I decided to just take 6 hours off so I could be there around noon but I\u2019ll still have to be up at 0400 the next day for work. I found out from my wife that SIL and future BIL are extremely upset and have been  intentionally ignoring me since they found out. They told my wife they expected me to take the entire day off (I work 12 hours every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) because they think of me as a brother and assumed I would just want to be there for the rehearsal, dinner, morning of wedding, and wedding/reception.\n\nThem not asking me to play a role, especially with my wife and our son having roles, confirmed for me that they don\u2019t like me, so I felt no obligation to take the morning of the wedding off of which I have no part. I work 12 hour shifts, and taking one day off really cuts into my available PTO so this played a factor in my decision as well.\n\nI\u2019m in no way upset for not having a role and my decision was in no way retaliatory. It\u2019s not my wedding so I don\u2019t make the calls, so it doesn\u2019t bother me.

When I said I was \u201cwaiting\u201d for a possible role, this was not me hoping for a role. I was simply waiting to hear a yes or no so I could schedule PTO accordingly.

Weddings rarely can honor all of the important people in a couple\u2019s lives, yet the significant others of those who do have a formal role are almost always included in these extra events.

What are they supposed to do, jeopardize their employment? \n\nThey're already going to the wedding and at least part of the reception, even though they have to get up at 4am the next morning plus dealing with toddler bedtime, etc.\n\nYes, indeed, the etiquette is otherwise, but it doesn't preclude the basic limits of life??", "He\u2019s going to the wedding. Why is he obligated to be there an entire day? I\u2019ve been MOH many times. Never would I expect, or really want, my partner to just be hanging out while we\u2019re getting ready.", ">So you are saying he need to take 12 plus hours off work unpaid?", "I think there\u2019s a difference in etiquette between having to invite the SO to the wedding and expecting the SO to attend all the bridesmaid activities. \n\nLike, I know plenty of people who have all the bridesmaids get together to do hair and make up before the wedding. I don\u2019t know anyone who expects the bridesmaids\u2019 SOs to be there too. If the bridesmaids got together to help pick out the wedding dress, I doubt the SOs would tag along. Same for the bachelorette party.\n\nAlso, if one person in a married unit can\u2019t make the wedding, that doesn\u2019t uninvite the couple. Like, I\u2019d never tell someone whose spouse is out of town on a business trip that they\u2019re not allowed to attend a wedding without them. They can RSVP as individuals.\n\nSo, no, spouses are not assumed to act as a single unit in relation to a wedding. It\u2019s simply proper etiquette to invite them both.", "Yes that was left out so I can add some info here.

Were they expecting all guests to not have other activities going on outside of their wedding that day?

Taking any more than that might mean OP is using time not yet accrued and leave him with no time in reserve in case he gets sick or needs to take care of LO for a sick day.\n\nEspecially if OP is working 3 twelve hour shifts a week, the company is likely to be under staffed and pretty strict with how time is accrued and used.", "He doesn't have enough for both days? So somewhere between 6 hours and 23 hours.", "Why does that matter?", "PTO is generally by the hour and he's taking 6 hrs off for the wedding.... Maybe cutting into means he can't earn more while he's not working and doesn't have enough to cover the time a rehearsal dinner would take?\n\nIdk, I think his, \"they didn't ask me to participate in the wedding, so it must mean that they don't like me\" makes him sound pretty insecure and potentially self-prophesizing if he bases decisions off it.\n\nI think it's pretty unreasonable for SIL to request him not to work the entire day and that him taking care of his son for the wedding is a good thing he's doing, but that one particular line just rubs me the wrong way, like his decision is entirely out of spite even though he claims it isn't.", "He said he doesn't have enough, not that he doesn't have any", "Exactly.

It sounds like SIL puts OP down a lot. I think it's a 2 birds, 1 stone kind of thing because he does have to take care of their toddler so he wouldn't be able to stay late anyway. Rehearsal dinner guest lists depend on who the bride and groom want to attend but it's traditionally meant to follow the ceremony rehearsal so really only the bridal party and parents have to be there.

It really is not that hard.", "My question is about the SIL.\n\nwhy didn't she tell op that she wanted him to come to the other stuff when he asked what time to be at the wedding for?\n\nSeems like a perfect time to lay out your expectations of what you want, yes?", "No, it\u2019s not. You\u2019re making this concept much more difficult by putting the onus on the family to push harder for him to be present with the family he married into.  So again, if OP asks \u201cwhen do I NEED to be there\u201d the implication is the latest available time to be there at. \nIf OP asks \u201cwhen do you want me there\u201d the implication is he is freely available for any time. \nIf you\u2019ve been to weddings, spouses of family are usually around the day the wedding, so it\u2019s not that unusual they were surprised he wasn\u2019t. \nThis doesn\u2019t seem like a difficult concept, but if you haven\u2019t been to many weddings then I can see your point that everything should be spelled out.", "No no no we don't critique the SILs commenter. If we do that we can't dunk on the useless husband now can we? /s", "How is he supposed to read *their* minds about *their* event?", "No you are putting the onus on him to read their mind and ask what time you WANT me there. Again when he asked they could have just told him instead of just giving him the NEED time and then being upset he didn't ask for the WANT time. If you are bad at communication and don't want to sometimes spell things out for someone to make things easier because they didn't use the magic words and then be upset your unspoken requests weren't met I can see your point.", "Well, it is a very good day for fishing honestly. We need to fish harder for reasons to call OP an AH. No matter how flimsy said reasons are. Its the AITA way after all. /s", "Hahaha too true", "I\u2019m more confused about why you expected to be a part of the wedding. You seem slightly bitter about it and take it as the SIL truly not liking you. \n\nI can\u2019t speak for if she likes you or not but that\u2019s a terrible way to judge her feelings for you.", "When my brother got married her family went bananas. We are a small working class family. SIL family owned businesses, etc. Her dad gave her a house as a wedding present. She had 9 bridesmaids, my sister or I were not asked. Her brothers 2 kids were the flower girl and ring bearer. I had one child of appropriate age. She was not included TBH, my brother really didn't have 9 bros to ask. So she had her cousins take spots, he had 3 of the 9 spots. He asked my husband so at least some family was there..lol \n\nWhen the official at the church photos were being taken,  my husband was not in the pictures. Her mother sent him off on an errand. Later I hear her saying he was 'too dark ' for the photos. WTF??\n\nThey're divorced now.\n\nNTA..what was your official job? Errand boy?", "You do actually sound upset about not being asked to be a groomsmen (I\u2019m not sure what other roles you\u2019re thinking there could be unless your a musician).  In laws aren\u2019t usually in the wedding party unless really close so don\u2019t worry about that piece.  It\u2019s really tough to narrow down those decisions and that choice is not a gage for whether or not they like you.  One thing does not mean the other.  \nExpecting you to be there all day is ridiculous and agree with others that could quickly turn into errand boy and way too long of a day for your son.  It would be absolutely normal for spouses of the wedding party to go to rehearsal dinner though - but if you need the money or missing those 6 hours could impact work status, NTA.  Them not talking to you over it is odd because they would likely know that.  Your wife supporting you is great but telling them it\u2019s because of the way they talk to you DOES make it appear retaliatory- how else could they take it?

Then few days before wedding, they decided there would only be immediate family members at temple ceremony and then couple would go take photos and then around 5pm a small reception where we were invited.\nSo I called my manager and told him I would be working that day as I finish my work around 3 anyways. But my god!!!!!  he, his wife and my aunt (his mom) were all butt hurt that how dare I work that day.

MANY spouses who are in the wedding party will come earlier, stay later, attend rehearsal dinners alone, etc either because their spouse is working, is taking care of the children, or just does not see the need to hang around for hours before/after the rehearsal dinner and/or ceremony. Weddings can be fun but they can also make for very long days for members of the wedding party! For spouses who are not members of the wedding party to come and just \"hang out\" can be more exhausting (not to mention extremely boring) than being in the wedding party. And some spouses will come along and because they are just sitting there, looking bored, they can run the risk of ending up being the gopher/errand man or woman and getting so overworked and tired before the ceremony that they can barely keep their eyes open afterwards until the cake is and they can politely go home. It is not an \"unspoken expectation\", in my experience, it is a decision to be made for every couple who finds themselves involved in a wedding in which one spouse is a member of the wedding party and one is not. (Personally, when I was a member of the wedding party and my husband was not, I would go earlier, stay later, etc by myself to fulfill my duties and my loving husband would show up in time to be a guest at the ceremony and because he was not bored by hours of hanging out or hours of running errands, he was the perfect gentleman guest during the reception, dancing with me, dancing with widows or other women without a dance partner, never letting my soda run dry, bringing me a piece of cake with lots of frosting, (just the way I like it), etc. It has only been since my spinal injury and confinement to a wheelchair that he has made a point to be there whenever I am.) So, OP, do not feel bad about your decisions, which are supported by your wife, about which events you will attend and how long you will be there. A full shift's worth of PTO is a very precious commodity when you work 12 hour shifts that should only be spent doing things that are important to and fun for all three of you - you, your wife, and your son - so it is entirely reasonable that you would not squander one for the wedding of a woman who cracks negative character jokes about you during family events.", "My partner works 4 10s overnight.

Idk what more they can expect.", "Are they expecting you to help wrangle your son in the morning while the wedding party is getting ready?", "So what would you have done if they did give you a role?

Also perhaps host guests who had to fly/drive in.\n\nAlso, let's be honest - the wedding is usually the bride and her parent's show.  Mom is the last person seated, signalling the ceremony is about to begin, and Dad does the aisle walk.  The Rehearsal Dinner is the chance for the Groom's parents to shine a little, as they usually pay for and host it.  The Groom's Dad often gives a speech, which puts a little spotlight on the groom before all eyes are on the bride on the wedding day.  That's his big moment, as he's not getting a dance the next evening the way the Father of the Bride and Mother of the Groom are.", "Ah, that changes everything for me.

I agree that it's challenging if you don't have those options available.", "My son won\u2019t even be there until I bring him.

Like if you invite a plus one as someone in a role do you expect the rando plus one to get a role? No. You just do your role and your plus one chills on a seat or stands to the side and when your roles done you hook back up.\n\nIt's a wedding not a 100 person acrobatic show.", "If they want someone to run errands they should hire someone so all family/friends can enjoy the ceremony.", "If I was boycotting my wife and son I wouldn\u2019t have humiliated myself by making this post. I am the one bringing my son to the venue and getting him ready. My wife doesn\u2019t need my help.

She probably answered as if he was simply curious.)\n\nSo literally misunderstanding the question could be reasonable. But the assumption *behind* it isn't. Bride probably assumed OP's wife would be directing him on the actual details when realistically it's a self-centered assumption that OP is just an extension of his wife who IS included. And bride/groom were probably casually assuming OP would be \"supporting HIS wife\" by being THEIR errand boy the morning of the ceremony. They're in the wrong there.\n\n...However, I do think wife's family could have a valid reason to feel slighted that OP isn't going to go to the rehearsal dinner since OP **was** invited to that part, especially because it seems that his decision not to go wasn't explicitly communicated by reaching out to explain/decline, and Bride only found out incidentally.  Both OP and his wife should have ***proactively*** communicated that he CAN'T get the time off work, not waited until the bride incidentally found out he just isn't taking time off for it. OP has understandable reasons not to go but there's a difference in how that information will be interpreted when it's revealed offhandedly. \n\nTL;DR- OP should have been better in proactively explaining/declining the rehearsal dinner invite.
