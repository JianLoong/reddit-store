But you set up the explanation a little differently, implying you did not think you should have to attend more events because you did not have a formal role in the wedding. That seems odd to me. Weddings rarely can honor all of the important people in a couple\u2019s lives, yet the significant others of those who do have a formal role are almost always included in these extra events. I\u2019m still picking up a vibe that you were generally salty about not being more formally included.", "So, no spouse or partner or whatever is generally \"specifically invited\" to that stuff. It's just expected that you two are a unit. Kind of like how you don't get your own wedding invitation mailed to you; you're both included in the one.

What do they expect you to do here?\n\nSeems like coming to the wedding, and bringing home toddler at a decent hour (you're WELCOME, literally every body else at the wedding - or did they want a melting down kid there?) *when you have to get up at 4am* is already super generous on your part, especially after the way they treat you?\n\nI just don't get what they expect you to do. This is pretty basic stuff.", "So what would you have done if you were asked to be in the wedding?\n\nAnd why does the title of your post have absolutely nothing to do with inability to take time off from work?", "My choice of wording was poor. I was simply waiting for a yes or no, not waiting with hopes of getting a role.", "Not to mention he opens three more paragraphs with some variation of \u201cI didn\u2019t get a role.\u201d\n\nOP is definitely salty about this.", "Just to add context: our son will be with my mother while I\u2019m at work on the morning of the wedding.

I\u2019m being told by my wife that I am not helping him down the aisle.", "Right but etiquette aside, OP *literally only has x-many hours they can take off work*. What are they supposed to do, jeopardize their employment? \n\nThey're already going to the wedding and at least part of the reception, even though they have to get up at 4am the next morning plus dealing with toddler bedtime, etc.\n\nYes, indeed, the etiquette is otherwise, but it doesn't preclude the basic limits of life??", "He\u2019s going to the wedding. Why is he obligated to be there an entire day? I\u2019ve been MOH many times. Never would I expect, or really want, my partner to just be hanging out while we\u2019re getting ready.", ">So you are saying he need to take 12 plus hours off work unpaid?", "I think there\u2019s a difference in etiquette between having to invite the SO to the wedding and expecting the SO to attend all the bridesmaid activities. \n\nLike, I know plenty of people who have all the bridesmaids get together to do hair and make up before the wedding. I don\u2019t know anyone who expects the bridesmaids\u2019 SOs to be there too. If the bridesmaids got together to help pick out the wedding dress, I doubt the SOs would tag along. Same for the bachelorette party.\n\nAlso, if one person in a married unit can\u2019t make the wedding, that doesn\u2019t uninvite the couple. Like, I\u2019d never tell someone whose spouse is out of town on a business trip that they\u2019re not allowed to attend a wedding without them. They can RSVP as individuals.\n\nSo, no, spouses are not assumed to act as a single unit in relation to a wedding. It\u2019s simply proper etiquette to invite them both.", "Yes that was left out so I can add some info here. There is no lack of parental guidance here, my mother is watching our son until I pick him up, take him to the venue, and get him in his tux.", "Fair enough, I'll edit.\n\nHowever, I do find it a bit too much of you to decide they don't like you because they didn't give you a role.

Were they expecting all guests to not have other activities going on outside of their wedding that day? Just because your wife is in the party, doesn't mean you're obligated to be at any other part of the events besides the ceremony and maybe the reception. They treat you like a guest you act like one.

It\u2019s weirder that this im hasn\u2019t been addressed, if not by him then his wife to her family.", ">If they had a role this 3yo suddenly wouldn\u2019t have been a problem.\n\nMaking the their 3yo is well looked after and home at a reasonable time isn't reliant on op being in the wedding party or not.\n\n>So now they\u2019re huffing and blaming their kid for their behaviour. \n\nNot even close! \n\n>OP made it clear they\u2019re huffing because they didn\u2019t get a role.\n\nNope. That's not what the post read like at all.", "They should have communicated earlier about what their expectations were instead of staying silent", "Then they should have asked if OP was going to be free to go. If OP doesn't get much holiday from work, he's going to be choosy when he uses it.\n OP is NTA.", "I\u2019ve been married and taken part of many weddings. Rehearsal dinners are just an excuse for the wedding party to have dinner. That\u2019s it. There is zero reason OP needed to be involved.", "Yeah gets to a point when they\u2019re so over tired that their behaviour just goes super downhill.", "He has enough to take 6 hours off on the wedding day and not enough to take any PTO the day before the wedding. Are you unfamiliar with how accruing PTO works? Taking any more than that might mean OP is using time not yet accrued and leave him with no time in reserve in case he gets sick or needs to take care of LO for a sick day.\n\nEspecially if OP is working 3 twelve hour shifts a week, the company is likely to be under staffed and pretty strict with how time is accrued and used.", "He doesn't have enough for both days? So somewhere between 6 hours and 23 hours.", "Why does that matter?", "PTO is generally by the hour and he's taking 6 hrs off for the wedding.... Maybe cutting into means he can't earn more while he's not working and doesn't have enough to cover the time a rehearsal dinner would take?\n\nIdk, I think his, \"they didn't ask me to participate in the wedding, so it must mean that they don't like me\" makes him sound pretty insecure and potentially self-prophesizing if he bases decisions off it.\n\nI think it's pretty unreasonable for SIL to request him not to work the entire day and that him taking care of his son for the wedding is a good thing he's doing, but that one particular line just rubs me the wrong way, like his decision is entirely out of spite even though he claims it isn't.", "He said he doesn't have enough, not that he doesn't have any", "Exactly.  And in this case all of OP's wife's family will be there so it's no as if she won't know anyone.", "My husband and I were these people during my brother's reception. We ran all the last minute errands, including getting my SIL's expensive lehenga. We really had to hurry up to get ready. I applied my own make-up. My kids weren't dressed on time. We joined the reception a bit late. But my brother bought the clothes we all wore and definitely included my husband in everything he could. \n\nThese people were looking for an errand boy without really appreciating the person. NTA", "Somehow I ended up making fancy sandwiches at a wedding...and ended up missing the actual ceremony.", "Or he's making it clear that he has no role that would require him to be there clarifying that he is not skipping out on anything he agreed to be at", "Yeah, like I said earlier the whole thing is weird. I would get they might be annoyed about the rehearsal dinner if wife said he would be there and they already paid for him.\n\n But to expect him to be around the morning of the wedding? For what? To use him to run errands without telling him?  \n\nAnd they seem to be really irate which I don't understand under any circumstances. If they keep it up, I don't know why OP would go at all.\n\nIt just feels like we don't have all the information.", "The whole thing sounds like messed up communications. Normally you know well in advance who is coming to your rehearsal dinner. You do t just wing it. And we don't really have enough info to know who dropped the ball there. \n\nI mean you invite people to things, they accept or decline in a timely manner, and life goes on. I'm wondering if wife accepted for the rehearsal dinner on behalf of OP and did not inform him. \n\nAs for just being generally available for no reason the morning of the wedding, f that.", "That's what I'm saying. There are always very specific invitations to a rehearsal dinner, and not by word of mouth. That's the missing information to me or part of it.", "OP does try to brush it off but I do think that there's some hurt feelings there, which is natural since OP and SIL don't get along. It sounds like SIL puts OP down a lot. I think it's a 2 birds, 1 stone kind of thing because he does have to take care of their toddler so he wouldn't be able to stay late anyway. Rehearsal dinner guest lists depend on who the bride and groom want to attend but it's traditionally meant to follow the ceremony rehearsal so really only the bridal party and parents have to be there. Honestly I wouldn't want to be around someone who regularly bullies me more than necessary", "OP also mentioned he's often the butt of SIL's derogatory jokes. If she's constantly putting him down, thinking she dislikes him would be a reasonable assumption.", "Was this an Indian wedding? You mentioned the lehenga. Dear lord the errand boys in Indian Weddings get a massive workout lmao. Always something for them to do", "Who's wedding? Were they extremely grateful?", "Then needing more money next pay because we are in an economic crisis depending where you are atm!", "Did you miss the entire first paragraph where he describes how she's always treated him before this?", "Wtf a brunch?  The rehearsal dinner is ridiculous enough. On my wedding day,  the makeup artist turned up at 8:30 am!  No time for brunch.", "Yup. Indian wedding. \n\nWe had to pick one of the bride's relatives. We had to buy more wedding favours as the crowd was getting overwhelming. My brother needed another pair of casual shoes for the photos. Had to buy some sunglasses for photos again. \n\nAnd then the lehenga. We were there and the tailor dude was still stitching \ud83e\udd23 imwe didn't have lunch that day. The lehenga looked wonderful though.\n \n\nMy girls kept calling us on the phone as to when we'll be back the entire time.", "Sorry, what point are you arguing?  If someone\u2019s asked you what time you HAVE to be somewhere, that implies the latest time you would need to appropriately arrive, and for weddings that would be the ceremony. OP didn\u2019t ask, \u201cWhat time would you like me there\u201d because family would have indicated Friday rehearsal and for Saturday mornings festivities as well, but OP had already made a point they won\u2019t be coming Friday or Saturday morning. Either case, doesn\u2019t make him an AH, he doesn\u2019t have to go if he doesn\u2019t want to.", "Happy cake day! Do you have any pictures of the lehenga or maybe you could just describe it? I Googled them and they're gorgeous!\n\nETA: fix punctuation", "I am arguing that when they gave him the HAVE to time they could have clarified by also giving him the WANT time. It really is not that hard.", "My question is about the SIL.\n\nwhy didn't she tell op that she wanted him to come to the other stuff when he asked what time to be at the wedding for?\n\nSeems like a perfect time to lay out your expectations of what you want, yes?", "No, it\u2019s not. You\u2019re making this concept much more difficult by putting the onus on the family to push harder for him to be present with the family he married into.  So again, if OP asks \u201cwhen do I NEED to be there\u201d the implication is the latest available time to be there at. \nIf OP asks \u201cwhen do you want me there\u201d the implication is he is freely available for any time. \nIf you\u2019ve been to weddings, spouses of family are usually around the day the wedding, so it\u2019s not that unusual they were surprised he wasn\u2019t. \nThis doesn\u2019t seem like a difficult concept, but if you haven\u2019t been to many weddings then I can see your point that everything should be spelled out.", "No no no we don't critique the SILs commenter. If we do that we can't dunk on the useless husband now can we? /s", "How is he supposed to read *their* minds about *their* event?", "No you are putting the onus on him to read their mind and ask what time you WANT me there. Again when he asked they could have just told him instead of just giving him the NEED time and then being upset he didn't ask for the WANT time. If you are bad at communication and don't want to sometimes spell things out for someone to make things easier because they didn't use the magic words and then be upset your unspoken requests weren't met I can see your point.", "Well, it is a very good day for fishing honestly. We need to fish harder for reasons to call OP an AH. No matter how flimsy said reasons are. Its the AITA way after all. /s", "Hahaha too true"]}
