I found out from my wife that SIL and future BIL are extremely upset and have been  intentionally ignoring me since they found out.

You are well aware that your wife will be busy that weekend with wedding things. It shouldn't need to be spelled out for you.", "Yes, YTA then. Wedding etiquette is that couples, especially married couples, are one unit, so if your wife is there, the expectation is you are there. It\u2019s not even for your SIL and her fianc\u00e9, it\u2019s to be there for your wife.\n\nEdit: For those who are downvoting, I recommend you check out some of the wedding reddits. There are plenty of brides over there asking some version of \u201cI don\u2019t like my maid of honor\u2019s fianc\u00e9/one of the groomsmen\u2019s wives/my sibling\u2019s SO, do I *really* have to invite them?\u201d and the answer is always yes, you do, couples are a package deal.", "Miss Cleo!!!\n\nEdit: he\u2019s family. He should have been planning to do the family stuff.", "Our son will be with my mother the morning of the wedding, I would not expect her to do maid of honor things and get our son ready.

The detail that the son you RSVP\u2019d \u201cYes\u201d for is THREE YEARS OLD is missing in the original post. It seems obvious some parental guidance would be assumed, and your reason for not covering that (not being given a role yourself) sound petty.", "If you lack the PTO, the situation seems fairly cut and dry. But you set up the explanation a little differently, implying you did not think you should have to attend more events because you did not have a formal role in the wedding. That seems odd to me. Weddings rarely can honor all of the important people in a couple\u2019s lives, yet the significant others of those who do have a formal role are almost always included in these extra events. I\u2019m still picking up a vibe that you were generally salty about not being more formally included.", "So, no spouse or partner or whatever is generally \"specifically invited\" to that stuff. It's just expected that you two are a unit. Kind of like how you don't get your own wedding invitation mailed to you; you're both included in the one. (It's not a perfect comparison, just trying to give the gist here). No one has the time or brain space to specifically invite all the spouses personally to all that stuff when they're planning a wedding.\n\nETA I just mean, that part in itself is in no way a slight or even an oversight.", "I mean, these are pretty basic parameters. What do they expect you to do here?\n\nSeems like coming to the wedding, and bringing home toddler at a decent hour (you're WELCOME, literally every body else at the wedding - or did they want a melting down kid there?) *when you have to get up at 4am* is already super generous on your part, especially after the way they treat you?\n\nI just don't get what they expect you to do. This is pretty basic stuff.", "So what would you have done if you were asked to be in the wedding?\n\nAnd why does the title of your post have absolutely nothing to do with inability to take time off from work?", "My choice of wording was poor. I was simply waiting for a yes or no, not waiting with hopes of getting a role.", "Not to mention he opens three more paragraphs with some variation of \u201cI didn\u2019t get a role.\u201d\n\nOP is definitely salty about this.", "Just to add context: our son will be with my mother while I\u2019m at work on the morning of the wedding. I\u2019m not leaving my wife responsible for our son and maid of honor duties. I\u2019m still the one bringing him to the venue and getting him into his tux. When I said I wasn\u2019t sure if I was supposed to help him, I only meant helping him walk down the aisle. I\u2019m being told by my wife that I am not helping him down the aisle.", "Right but etiquette aside, OP *literally only has x-many hours they can take off work*. What are they supposed to do, jeopardize their employment? \n\nThey're already going to the wedding and at least part of the reception, even though they have to get up at 4am the next morning plus dealing with toddler bedtime, etc.\n\nYes, indeed, the etiquette is otherwise, but it doesn't preclude the basic limits of life??", "He\u2019s going to the wedding. Why is he obligated to be there an entire day? I\u2019ve been MOH many times. Never would I expect, or really want, my partner to just be hanging out while we\u2019re getting ready.", ">So you are saying he need to take 12 plus hours off work unpaid?", "I think there\u2019s a difference in etiquette between having to invite the SO to the wedding and expecting the SO to attend all the bridesmaid activities. \n\nLike, I know plenty of people who have all the bridesmaids get together to do hair and make up before the wedding. I don\u2019t know anyone who expects the bridesmaids\u2019 SOs to be there too. If the bridesmaids got together to help pick out the wedding dress, I doubt the SOs would tag along. Same for the bachelorette party.\n\nAlso, if one person in a married unit can\u2019t make the wedding, that doesn\u2019t uninvite the couple. Like, I\u2019d never tell someone whose spouse is out of town on a business trip that they\u2019re not allowed to attend a wedding without them. They can RSVP as individuals.\n\nSo, no, spouses are not assumed to act as a single unit in relation to a wedding. It\u2019s simply proper etiquette to invite them both.", "Yes that was left out so I can add some info here. There is no lack of parental guidance here, my mother is watching our son until I pick him up, take him to the venue, and get him in his tux.", "Fair enough, I'll edit.\n\nHowever, I do find it a bit too much of you to decide they don't like you because they didn't give you a role. Life has more grey tones than a simple black and white picture.", "Definitely.", "What about the rehearsal dinner, the wedding brunch etc?", "You sound like you have your son well-covered. I\u2019ll vote NTA between you and SIL. \n\nI would ask how your wife feels.", "His SIL has a history of making jokes at his expense. To me that implies dislike and disrespect\u2026", "I don\u2019t have enough PTO to cover the rehearsal or dinner the day before. I\u2019ve only been a part of my wedding and I don\u2019t remember a brunch. No one has mentioned a brunch to me.", "So, I don't understand why this limitation per your job isn't just the end of it. \n\nRegardless of family drama etc., are you supposed to risk your literal livelihood for their wedding weekend? \n\nIf you can't be there, you can't be there. And it sounds like you can only take off a certain amount of time - unfortunately, but that's life - so you just *can't* be there for the extra stuff, only the main event.\n\nI'm not sure what they think you can/should do about this basic limitation?", "My question was who is going to help your wife during those events with your toddler. And I assumed the day after was the wedding breakfast/brunch/tea whatever.", "My wife will be responsible for our son during the rehearsal and rehearsal dinner since I can\u2019t take that day off. She will not be responsible for him the day of the wedding at all."]}
