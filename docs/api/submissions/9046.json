I have actual rules set in my house, like bedtimes, rules on electronics, making her go to church, etc etc. \n\n Over the last few months we've had issues with her, she's been caught with contraband at school, doing stuff she's not supposed to do on her phone, and causing problems with in our family and our moral state. Now she even refuses to go to events with us, and it's affecting her siblings and stepsiblings. So...we grounded her until she agrees to attend events with us, and she's already had everything taken out of her room for a few weeks before this. we will obviously, give everything back, we don't want to be wardens, but this behavior needs to be fixed. It's long nights of verbal shouting matches and everybody upset, and I'm exhausted with our new baby and can't do it anymore.\n\n She went for a visit to her dads house and came home complaining about how much she hates living with us and how she wants to live with her dad. One day she was screaming about it to me on the way to church, and so after we got home I gave her 30 minutes to pack a bag and dropped her on the doorstep of their house. My ex husband is mad at me, saying that we haven't talked about any of this and his daughter with his new wife has to have major surgery to have tumors removed, they'll end up in the hospital for a little bit (Their daughter is 2, and has a form of kidney cancer) and he doesn't think he will be able to spend a ton of time with our 13 year old.

You\u2019re apparently trying to punish your daughter for emotionally explosive, disruptive behaviour, by acting in an emotionally explosive and disruptive way.\n\nDid you ever thing to sit down with your daughter and her father and actually discuss things? A relative of mine had her stepson say he wished he lived with her and her husband(his dad) because he had more fun there. She sat him down and explained that they do fun things with him because they didn\u2019t see him every day, so they wanted to make the most of his visits. She explained that if he lived there, he\u2019d have earlier bedtimes, he\u2019d be doing his homework and wouldn\u2019t be going bowling or to the cinema every day.\n\nThat\u2019s a conversation you could have had. Instead you alarmed her by dumping her on her unexpectedly on her father\u2019s doorstep- you didn\u2019t day whether you knocked or checked he was home. Even more than that, you dropped her unexpectedly on the doorstep of a family trying to care for a TWO YEAR OLD CANCER PATIENT?\n\nIn all seriousness, are you actually insane? Have you got any notion what a ridiculous thing that was to do?", "YTA for 2 reasons:  \n\n\n1)  Dropping the kid off with no notice to your ex.  \n\n2)  Misleading title.", "YTA- Why would you think its ok to not at least call him and talk to him like a adult? I am sorry but in what way would you not be the one at fault?", "INFO:\n\n>\tand causing problems with in our family and our moral state. \n\nHow is YOUR (or any other family member\u2019s) \u201cmoral state\u201d affected by your child or anyone else?", "Kicking your 13-year-old out of their home as a punishment for typical 13-year-old behavior is beyond the pale. They complain about not wanting to go places with you, mouth off, use their phone inappropriately, and bring stuff they shouldn't to school. This is par for the course; it's not like they're out making snuff videos in their free time.\n\nTheir dad is wrapped up in his kid who has cancer; it's common knowledge that siblings get neglected when one child is seriously ill. So they're already going through a hard time. Then you kick them out with 30 minutes' notice because you're too exhausted from your new baby to parent them.\n\nCan you imagine what this poor child is feeling? *Of course* they're acting out. The word for punishing your children by threatening their sense of security is abuse. And to be dropped off on their dad's doorstep only for him not to want them either? My god.\n\nYes, YTA. If you're having a hard time communicating effectively with your child for, again, perfectly normal behavior, you go to family counseling, not give them 30 minutes to pack their things. I feel so sorry for your poor kid.\n\nETA: There will be a social worker assigned to the pediatric oncology unit where your child's half-sister is being treated. Their job is to pull together supports for families in crisis. Please urge your ex to set up a meeting between your child and the social worker so that they can gain access to help. Siblings of sick kids needing counseling is super common, and the social worker will know what services are available and can connect your child to them.\n\nEdit 2: Pronouns, as OP says in a comment that their child is nonbinary.", "OPs daughter is non-binary according to her comments and this is what the issues at home are about. OP is a religious hateful person that kicked her child out for being themselves. Hope CPS gets called and your other kids get taken.", ">He's upset that I just dropped her off with no notice\n\nAbsolutely YTA for dropping her off with zero notice. If you're going to drop your kid off at somebody's house, a phone call or text is necessary. And given the circumstances your ex is going through atm, it's *extremely* necessary.", "Yta on about 3 fronts\n\n1. You dropped her off with zero communication with your ex, and in another comment  admit that you did it specifically because you know he would have said no. \n2. In the same comment you say you did it to \"get your point across\" so you admit that your intent was to hurt and upset your child by dumping her on her dad.\n3. You're exhausted with your new baby but apparently didn't consider that her dad has a toddler with cancer? \n\nI have to ask, have you tried talking to her about why she's acting out? why she doesn't want to go to church? that's totally normal for a 13 year old girl to start acting out but it seems like you've done nothing to address whatever the root issue is. It's possible that you have and just didn't include that in this post but I think it's important for proper judgment. She might actually be acting out because she needs help. Another question, is she the oldest of your kids?", "YTA. From this story I have not seen one incidence of you talking to her about what's going on. She gets in trouble, you punish her. She speaks out, you punish her. There's this weird \"causing problems in our family and our moral state\" that I would like to know more about because my knee-jerk reaction is that this might be why she's acting out. She refuses to go to events with you? What events? Does she *have* to go or would you *like* her to go? If you're forcing her to go, that could be an explanation.\n\nOn top of presenting a story where you fail to communicate with your daughter, you quite literally dump her onto your ex's lap without communicating with him. I get that you were angry, but you didn't even read him in what's going on, so you show up and you're like \"Here, she's your problem\". Think about how your DAUGHTER is seeing this situation.\n\nYou had so many opportunities to change the direction you went and you're rapidly running out of the few that remain before you either completely ruin your relationship with your child or end up in therapy trying to keep from completely ruining it.  \n\n\nEDIT: Also, your title is a lie. You didn't let her visit her dad, you dropper her off because parenting got hard.", "YTA. You can\u2019t abandon a child at the your ex-husbands house without warning. Especially if you know his other daughter has cancer. \n\nI get kids are hard work but you signed up for having them. You signed up for the visitation the way it was.

Christ you really just left her on the doorstop without even giving him a heads up? \n\n>she's already had everything taken out of her room for a few weeks before this\n\nWhat does this mean? What is 'everything'?\n\nIt's no wonder she doesn't want to live with you. This sounds like a great way to tell her you prefer your new baby over her", "YTA, misleading title and dropping her off with no notice, custody changes need agreements from both parents.", "YTA to your ex and your daughter. She's 13. This behavior is normal and the way you're going about it is only going to push her away. \n\nYou met behavior that you think is disorderly with like behavior of your own by dropping her off without noticed. It was reactionary and other teacher her to do the same.\n\nIf you wanted your ex to take her you need to arrange it. Period.", "The more you force church, the less likely she'll seek it out on her own when she gets older. All you're doing is breeding resentment for organized religion. This is coming from someone that goes to church now, but didn't when I was her age.", "Yes YTA.\n\nYour teenager is inevitably going to do teenage things, like pushing boundaries, trying to negotiate rules she likes better, throwing fits and stomping out. You are the adult in this situation, and are both supposed to continue to house your teenager even when she is obnoxious AND to control your temper. \n\nYou basically threw a tantrum and dropped your 13 year-old in the care of people who are already struggling with a child with cancer, and had no notice and were therefore unprepared.\n\n(Also, wtf do you mean that your 13 year-old is \"causing problems with your moral state\"? Is it possible that some of your rules are best let go, or that not every outing absolutely requires your 13 year-old to tag along?)\n\nYou were not only TA to your ex, you are TA to your daughter. That is some shitty parenting there.\n\nEdited to add: What is your plan for the day that one of the children who is biologically both yours and your current partners is obnoxious? However you think you would deal with a kid you can't drop off at someone else's house, you really need to deal with your older daughter the same way.", "YTA\n\nWTF?  Moral state?  Forced Church?  Removed all her things to force her to do church?  WTF?  \n\nHonestly, just by this I want to go live with your ex husband too!  \n\nI get that she may be using her phone for things you don't like.  That's fair.  Especially if it's sexual in nature.  That is entirely fair and warrants some form of talk/discipline that doesn't stifle her burgeoning sexuality.  You have to understand that last part.  She's becoming a woman and needs the freedom to explore her sexuality safely, while having a trusted person to talk about the really big things with.  You've removed yourself from that role here.\n\nChurch and moral state is a whole other ball game.  Forced church does not equate to belief or a sense of morality.  I've known plenty of religious people who have terrible morals.  Your religion may not be what she believes.  Your morality may not be what she wants her own morality to be.  Punishing her for this will do one thing, and one thing only, push her away.  You've almost guaranteed that she will not take part in your religion or moral views.\n\nAs for dropping her off at your ex's.  That's just shitty.  You cannot drop a child off at someone's house unannounced.  That's rude as fuck at best.  Downright child endangerment at worst.  What if no one was home?  What if no one was home for 3 days?  You didn't care.  You didn't care about your daughter.  You cared about your religion, your morality, and how your family viewed you and your parenting style and morality.  \n\nYour whole write up is about you.  Nothing about how you're trying to help your daughter.  I get that you're tired and upset and flustered due to this and a new baby.  But you really, REALLY fucked this one up.  You need to set your religion, morality, and pride aside and apologize to multiple people and do better for your daughter.", "YTA and every comment you post makes you an even bigger Asshole. You dropped your daughter of without notice knowing that her 2 year old stepsibling is currently getting surgery for cancer aka not the best environment right now just to prove a point. You are mad at your daughter for \"claiming\" to be nonbinary because you don't want your other kids \"exposed to that stuff\". You took everything away from your daughter that isn't school or sleep related because her being nonbinary \"goes against God\" and you need to \"fix her\".

Or are you trying to discipline her into falling in line and doing as she's told? I say YTA because you don't specify what the actual problem behaviors are. Are they really a problem, or are they just things you disagree with? What kind of contraband? What does she do on her phone that she shouldn't be doing? What events does she want to skip? I get trying to instill your values in your children, but you can't discipline them into her. She's gotta have her own voice, and if you continue to try to silence her, you are going to clash a lot more as she gets older. Also, I& your husband are both assholes.

Now she even refuses to go to events with us, and it's affecting her siblings and stepsiblings. So...we grounded her until she agrees to attend events with us, and she's already had everything taken out of her room for a few weeks before this. we will obviously, give everything back, we don't want to be wardens, but this behavior needs to be fixed. It's long nights of verbal shouting matches and everybody upset, and I'm exhausted with our new baby and can't do it anymore.\n\n She went for a visit to her dads house and came home complaining about how much she hates living with us and how she wants to live with her dad. One day she was screaming about it to me on the way to church, and so after we got home I gave her 30 minutes to pack a bag and dropped her on the doorstep of their house. My ex husband is mad at me, saying that we haven't talked about any of this and his daughter with his new wife has to have major surgery to have tumors removed, they'll end up in the hospital for a little bit (Their daughter is 2, and has a form of kidney cancer) and he doesn't think he will be able to spend a ton of time with our 13 year old.

Instead of taking the opportunity to listen to your child and watch them grow into the person they're going to become, you're trying to shoehorn them into your ideal image. Of *course* that's going to create tension. And if your child is pushing back, well, your bible tells you that's disrespect, so that requires punishment. I'm betting \"everything\" taken out of their room means literally everything. I bet they have to \"earn back\" their bedclothes, pillows, and even favored clothing. Especially if their favorite clothes are part of their identity. I've heard of this before.\n\nEnter your ex, your child's father, who isn't as strict with your child, and perhaps has a different way of approaching how he parents: maybe he understands the child is their own person and not just an extension of himself. Maybe he's less concerned about the image his family projects so he's less concerned about his oldest child presenting in a non-binary fashion. Maybe, because he has a sick baby, he understands how fragile life is and he doesn't want to dull his oldest child's shine because life's too short for that.\n\nWhatever his reason, he gives your child more room to be true to themself while they're in his care, so they prefer to spend time at his home. They're not shoved into impossible roles, bound by rules that feel stifling, or told to believe in a religion that has a history of oppressing and even killing people like them. (Don't debate me on this one. I'm trans, and I know what I'm talking about. I don't even need to know what denomination.) \n\nWhat you're doing is showing your child that you care more about what your god, religion, and your church friends think of your kid than what you as a mother think of them. You're showing them their feelings matter less than those of outsiders. You're showing them that your love is contingent on whether or not they can successfully convince others outside the family that they deserve your love. \n\nTheir father likely doesn't make them jump through these hoops. \n\nWhen your child turns 18, they're going to leave your house and never look back. You'll never see them again unless you start seeing them as the *person they are* right now instead of the *fictional person you expect them to be.*\n\nYou're also TA for not giving your ex-husband any notice about dropping your child off at his house, so he could make sure he was prepared to receive your child, especially during what's clearly a heavy-duty week for him. I hope your ex's kid will be okay so he can concentrate on taking you to court for full custody of your child, and you're free to wash your hands of them. \n\nIf you truly are a child of a loving god, maybe think about what you're doing, if you're really loving as Jesus taught.

I believe, personally, that most people go through puberty a little confused and that gender fluidity is a thing that helps them think through that - and that was hard for me to wrap my brain around originally, but it's ok.  Most kids who go through gender fluid stages seem to end up settling nearer one end or the other, which is fine.  But the middle is fine too.  And mom, the more you tell kiddo that it is not fine, the more they will dig their heels in RIGHT THERE.  Rather than worrying about gender, maybe focus on bodily autonomy and being safe in your body.\n\nI'm well acquainted with Genesis's description of gender.  And then with Matthew's, 'eunuchs who were born that way.'\n\nI'm acquainted with the estimate that 1 in 2000 babies are born with genitals that are not obviously male or female, and in the 1950s, it was 'easier to make a hole than a pole'.  Even as genetic testing has become almost inexpensive and quick enough that within a couple months of birth you can know if baby is XY, with androgen insensitivity, XX with adrenal hyperplasia, XXY, XO, or some mosaic of those options - in addition to other issues that can cause a baby with XX or XY to have inconclusive genitals, it remains a pressure for parents to 'decide'.  As though God didn't do well enough for our liking.\n\nBecause as a society, we like checkboxes.  Black and White.  Male and Female.  \n\nThe world has a lot of gray.  And if I have brought my kids up knowing that, \"By this will all men know that you are My disciples, the love you show one for another,\" but then all I show them is the magnitude of my hate and unwillingness to examine my preconceptions - how have I brought my child any closer to my God?", "There is no hate like Christian love.

You have a lot of nerve calling it a 'moral state' when you're just a bad mom who uses religion to fit their own bigoted narrative. So what if your daughter is nonbinary?
