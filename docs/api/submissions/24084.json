Not sure where you live but it's required by law to give up a seat to a pregnant person.\n\nDude was rude to chastise you and not give up his own seat but you were in the wrong for denying the request.", "Wow, so many assholes on that train.", "ESH except the pregnant lady.\n\nFFS just be a decent human being. It's not just about being tired. Being pregnant means your gravity center has shifted and your balance is not good. Standing for the ride puts her at risk of falling and injuries. \n\nThe health of a pregnant woman and her baby is more important than your laziness.", "YTA- but so is the guy sitting next to you. Once you decided to be selfish and say no to her he should of stepped up and offered his seat. For all you know she could of just worked a 10 shift too.", "NTA, would be nice if you gave up your seat, but you were not ultimately responsible. The pregnant lady also understood this and dropped the request.\n\nNow that man on the other hand is the asshole, if he cared so much he should offer his seat to help the women, regardless of gender. Trying to guilt trip you into giving up your seat is just horrible. At least he ignored you for the rest of the ride, I don't see any more reason to talk to him further.", "YTA with everyone else who just stayed seated.", "Only one asshole here, and it's not OP.\n\nUnless there are specifically reserved seats, there is not an obligation to give up one's seat to a pregnant person. Very nice to do and a great courtesy, but someone is not an asshole for simply being tired.\n\nThe pregnant woman is, of course, not an asshole. She's got a good reason to want to sit and she seemed polite and, most of all, accepted OP's polite refusal.\n\nThe man who had the nerve to criticize OP while not being willing to offer the same courtesy? Complete and total hypocrite and asshole. OP's response was spot-on.", "NTA", "The guy sitting next to you is definitely the biggest AH here", "Depends on where you were sitting...if you were all the way in the front... yta. Sitting anywhere else than not so much. As far as the man....I can't say that he is the AH for not also offering up his seat because he could be disabled. But with that logic....so could you....except that you gave an excuse and it had nothing to do with disability. All I know is somebody on the metro should've offered up her seat before she should ever have to ask... and once they heard her ask and no one gave it up.....a whole lot of AHs were born.", "ESH, but not the pregnant lady", "NTA, you had no part in the conception of that child, you plan to take no part in the upbringing of that child. Why should you have to help in the assembly process?", "ESH minus the pregnant lady. I understand why you didn\u2019t, and in your mind it was probably justified but you should have gotten up. Dude next to you is an even bigger AH.", ">The man next to me however decided to tell me I was an asshole for not giving her my seat considering I was a woman and should be more willing to support and help other women.\n\nHypocrite. NTA", "NTA\n\nEvery able bodied person that didn't jump up at the sight of that pregnant woman needing a seat is TA. Women should not be the default person to sacrifice comfort for others.", "Definitely YTA but on the bright side, you were not the only AH in that train. Little acts of kindness can go a long way.", "ESH especially you. First of the man was right but he was out of place and  in the wrong as he could also have offered his seat.\n\nSecondly, she came to you because she most probably felt more comfortable to ask you as you are a woman yourself. Everyone on that train could have offered but it doesn't make you less of an AH.", "ESH - you all suck for not giving up your seats. But YTA because she literally asked and you said no because you were tired. The pregnant woman was probably tired along with a host of other thing s from being pregnant", "Wow YTA but dear god it seems there was a carriage full of them too so you were in good company so you can help spread the AHness.\n\nHow this should have played out in a nice world.... Pregnant lady asks you to give up seat, you of course give up your seat.  On standing up the AH who challenged you then gives up his seat for you.  However alas you weren't in that world and its actually full of shits.", "YTA you all were rude", "NTA", "Everyone on that metro is TA because SOMEONE should have offered their seat to the obviously pregnant woman. A fall on the moving metro could be dangerous to her.  \n\n\nThe guy next to you is especially the AH, because critiquing you while retaining his own seat is ridiculous.  \n\n\nIf your condition was truly precarious, then you are NTA. Given that you were not in good shape at the time and felt that you needed to sit based on your condition, responding \"I'm sorry, but I'm not feeling well right now and need to sit\" would probably have helped.", "ESH. Except the pregnant woman. Yes other people could have given up their seat but they didn\u2019t. Is the guy who berated you an AH? Absolutely. Do we not do anything because other people could have and didn\u2019t? You were tired. I get that. But it wouldn\u2019t have killed you. Sometimes doing the right thing isn\u2019t the easy choice. We\u2019re you obligated? No. Would it have been a kindness? Yes.", "More info needed: Are there designated seats for passengers who require a seat (disability, pregnancy, age etc)?", "Yes you should give it up but understand why you wouldn't want to but the guy next to you not doing it Is complete bs", "If that guy had such a problem with you not giving her your seat, he could have given his.\n\nIt would have been nice to offer your seat to someone who would be appreciative of it, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH for simply declining giving it to her\n\nNTA", "NTA - Damn - Are you really saying the guy next to you didn't give up his seat and called you an AH for not letting the woman sit?  That takes AH behavior to the next level.  I would have said more than please fuck off if I were you.\n\nAs a man, I will always give a pregnant woman my seat if she is near me.  Wow, you were on a metro full of AHs.", "INFO: Usually in metro, busses etc they have designated seats for elderly, pregnant women or people with disability. Were you or the person next to you sitting in one those sits? \n\nIf yes, then ESH (not the pregnant lady) because anyone of you could've gotten up, given he was able bodies and not old.   \nNTA, if you the seats were the normal seat that anyone could have.   \nalso ESH on the metro for not offering the seat before she even asked. It's just polite sometimes.", "NTA. Yeah, giving up your seat would have been nice, but you're not obligated to do so.

The whole bus is full of ass holes except the poor pregnant lady.", "NTA", "YTA.\n\nShe's heavily pregnant and you're a bit tired from work. I'd bet she's bloody tired as well.\n\nJust because everyone else were being assholes, doesn't absolve you of the shitty choice you made.", "More info needed were these seats specifically for the disabled and or pregnant? Cause if they were you absolutely would be the AH as those seats are reserved for a reason and if you choose to sit in them you have an obligation to give them up to the type of person they are reserved for.", "I\u2019m torn, but leaning towards YTA as I would give a pregnant woman or an elderly person my seat regardless of how I feel. However, the man next to you is no better, and perhaps even more of an AH.", "ESH everybody is an asshole for not offering a seat", "NTA", "NTA , someone else who didn't just work a 10 can stand", "NTA - but it would have been nice had someone given her their seat. I probably would have TBH. \n\nWhen I was pregnant I was too shy and you never know who has an invisible disability or other reason or not offering. I ended up fainting once and then didn't have to ask after that.", "Look, unless you sat in a seat specifically marked as a seat for the disabled and pregnant you have no obligation  to give it up. It is no joke to be pregnant but also a no joke to work overnight. People have each their issues and one can't know how exactly the other one feels. Singling you out because you are a woman is honestly not so cool, but it is what it is.  And you were right, the man could've let her sit instead so he has no business talking down to you . You and the lady are NTA both.", "YTA, and so is that man that would rather sit their and judge you than give up his own seat. And so is every other man for sitting there whilst she pregnantly stood", "ESH but the lady.\n\nFirst of all, it is the duty of a man to stand up (not only but especially if a woman comes that it pregnant, a man should always be ready to give up his seat for a woman). But they didn't. They're arseholes for that.\n\nThen you are an arsehole for being childish. If the others are doing something wrong, this doesn't allow you to do the same.", "NTA. As an ex colleague (f) once said to me. She's pregnant not sick", "NTA. If you feel bad, you feel bad. The guy calling you out while sitting himself and having no issue (I assume otherwise he\u2019d use it to blame you more) is insane.", "Everyone who didn\u2019t give up a seat is the AH in this situation. We live in a society and sometimes people forget that.", "NTA.\n\nExhausted after 10 hour shift is perfectly acceptable for you to keep your seat.\n\nOften I find it\u2019s women being asked or offering, and I have had the glares when I decline because my condition isn\u2019t visible.", "NTA, it's not a written rule to give your seat to pregnant women. It's just a nice and courteous thing to do, doesn't mean you're an AH. The man with double standards is the AH more than you. He recognized that you didn't give it up but yet he didn't?!", "YTA and so is everyone around you. Pregnant women need to sit safely on the train not because they\u2019re tired, but because they\u2019re at risk of much more serious injury that everyone else. Their centre of gravity is off thanks to pregnant belly. Their balance is off. And if they fall, they\u2019re risking a whole lot more than you. Every single person that pretended not to see her or even made her ask for a seat rather than offering us a HUGE asshole.", "YTA - Being that pregnant trumps your work day. Her work day never ends building a baby.", "YTA. I work 10hr night shifts and have also been pregnant. The fact that she asked for your seat, tells me that she was struggling to stand. In that situation I wouldn't think twice about standing up, even after my shift .", "I find it stunning that someone else would, while sitting, criticize you for not giving up your seat.", "I'm sorry to say but YTA, but a soft YTA. I can understand how you must gave felt being fatigued and all however, a pregnant woman asked for your seat. Personally if a pregnant woman asked for my seat i (M) would give it up with out question regardless of how tired i was, so that's  AH part. However, those so called men sitting on thier asses without offering thier seats are the real AH here. Looks like chivalry has died.", "Yes. If you set your personal standards based on the shortcomings of others, you will always be the asshole. It\u2019s a pretty low bar. I work 16 hour shifts and can muster the strength to stand for thirty minutes for a pregnant lady. Unless you\u2019re disabled, so can you.", "ESH \n\nthe therory when a lot of people could do the right thing so no one do it because the other ones could. amazing how the brain works to find excuses and limited our responsibilities. \n\nwork the same way when a woman is harassed in public. the 20 person who saw her will think \u00ab\u00a0what should I say something when 19 other persons could\u00a0\u00bb. But at the end no one do anything. \n\nFind excuses for yourself. You should have give your seat.", "NTA. It would have been nice to give her your seat, but not required. The man who gave you shit about it is a huge MFing AH and absolutely should have given up his own seat. Pretty much everybody else around there was also an asshole.", "Esh", "YTA\n\nthe guy next to you doesn't nullify your behaviour.\n\nI cannot believe the amount of votes supporting you in the replies. I'm assuming this is America because here, in London, there's a load of people who would jump up and offer their seat (assuming they look up from their phone), and certainly would not need to be asked.\n\nShe's heavily pregnant, and you've been on your feet 10 hours. Guess which hurts more? I gave up my seat to a pregnant lady on the way home after my first marathon! It's basic human decency, which you lack.", "YTA \u2026.in fact you were all TA", "I mean, I guess NTA, you aren't obligated to give up your seat (unless you blasted past her to get to it, that would be assholish) and the dude next to you sure as hell should have either offered his seat or kept his mouth shut.", "NTA, as you said, there were many other people who could've given her a seat. If they were true gents, they would've done it before she even asked. Your seat neighbour has some gall to call you rude when he could've moved.", "The guy giving you shit for not doing something he could have done definitely makes him an AH. I would say you are a bit to. \n\n>However there were many other able bodied people on the metro and I was extremely tired from work.\n\nThis unfortunately is the bane of politeness and civil responsibility. Everyone expects everyone else to make the effort so they don't have to. ESH.", "ESH - but the pregnant woman \n\nThe guy next to you is especially a huge AH. I get why you didnt give up your seat but yeah\u2026", "That is the first I have heard of that law. It is not universal.", "Where do you live? Just curious. Not a law where Im from.", "She isn't lazy fuck off", "She was not the only person on the train that could give up her seat. To call someone lazy after working a 10 hour overnight shift?? \n\nYou sound like a fucking child.", "NTA\n\nThis is the correct take.", "yeah this. wdym because she is a woman? sure sounds like you wanted an excuse to not give up on your seat either. And OP is still an AH too obviously", "Because that young person might be the one looking after you in a care home one day.", "&#x200B;\n\n>Every able bodied person that didn't jump up at the sight of that pregnant woman needing a seat is TA. \n\nso... including OP?", "Communal assholery.", "Calm down lmao", "Yes your right. I think me telling her I didn\u2019t want to stand for 30+ min was a bit rude and would make me an asshole. The way you said it seems way more appropriate and I will remember that if a situation like this ever comes up again.", "Oh yesh trains here have them definitely need this^", "Yes. There are supposed to be seats like that on the metro however I think the section we were in didn\u2019t have any. Down the line would have but all seats were taken as far as I could see.", "If she fell on the metro, which happens super easily when your center of gravity is off kilter in pregnancy, her baby could die. Yes, pregnancy is natural, but it\u2019s also way more dangerous in certain situations.", "Pregnancy does make people sick", "They were right, there were plenty of other able bodied persons to offer their seats.", "I want to defend the States a bit, I have never been in a situation where the pregnant lady would not be given a seat.  She would have had more than one option, I find this story odd.", "What the fuck. Americans aren\u2019t heathens.", "They can both be assholes", ">She was not the only person on the train that could give up her seat.\n\nThat's why I said ESH ?! In like \"everyone sucks here except the pregnant lady\" ?\n\nAnd yeah, after a 10 hour shift, you will be tired. I did 12 hours shifts in my life of manual work, so I am very much aware. Doesn't mean you don't have a single drop of energy to do something as basic as standing up. If this is the case, the job is not for you.", "This answer sucks lmao", "She wasn't able bodied. She was exhausted.", "No this woman is trying to rob you of your individualism by forcing you the play a part in her pregnancy, you have every right to say no to anyone in this case, i staunchly feel you are NTA", "Fair enough, and that's a relief to know.\n\nIt does seem odd that an entire carriage would not give their seat up doesn't it?", "I feel like anyone here who says they're not the AH needs to state their nationality!!! Surely this has to be cultural thing?\n\nNo guarantee the OP is American tbf.", "Your question sucks!", "That\u2019s what dumbfounded me, too. No one jumped up the moment she walked in? That\u2019s just sad."]}
