Prior to the passage of the PWFA, employees seeking reasonable accommodations under federal law were required to: (1) have a pregnancy-related disability, or (2) identify other similarly situated employees who received accommodations. Now, covered employers will be required to provide accommodations to employees with \u201cknown limitations\u201d covered under the PWFA unless doing so imposes an undue hardship.\n\nCovered Employers\nThe PWFA applies to all private and public employers with 15 or more employees.\n\nCovered Individuals\nCovered employers will be required to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified applicants and employees with \u201cknown limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.\u201d While no specific conditions are referenced in the law, \u201cknown limitations\u201d is defined by the PWFA as a \u201cphysical or mental condition related to, affected by, or arising out of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions that the employee or employee\u2019s representative has communicated to the employer.\u201d\n\nAn aim of the PWFA was to fill a coverage gap for pregnant workers left by the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (\u201cPDA\u201d). \u201cKnown limitations\u201d covered under the PWFA do not need to be considered a \u201cdisability\u201d under the ADA, nor does a worker need to identify similarly situated non-pregnant employees receiving accommodations as was required to receive accommodations under the PDA. Notably, the PWFA does not replace federal, state or local laws that are more protective of employees and applicants affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.\n\nReasonable Accommodations\nCovered employers are now required to provide reasonable accommodations for \u201cknown limitations\u201d, unless the employer can show the accommodation imposes an \u201cundue hardship\u201d. The PWFA applies the ADA\u2019s definition of \u201cundue hardship,\u201d defined as any action requiring \u201csignificant difficulty or expense\u201d for an employer.\n\nRecently, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the \u201cEEOC\u201d) issued a guidance document titled \u201cWhat You Should Know About the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act\u201d, which includes the following examples of possible accommodations under the PWFA:\n\nability to sit or drink water;\n\ncloser parking;\n\nflexible hours;\n\nappropriately sized uniforms and safety apparel;\n\nadditional breaks to use the restroom, eat, and rest;\n\nleave or time off to recover from childbirth; and\n\nbe excused from strenuous activities and/or activities that involve exposure to compounds not safe for pregnancy.\n\nBefore the end of 2023, the EEOC is expected to issue final regulations related to the PWFA to provide more detail regarding the law and its implementation.\n\nSimilar to the ADA, employers must engage in an \u201cinteractive process\u201d with their employees requesting accommodations in order to determine what accommodations may be reasonable. This involves a good faith discussion to determine a workable solution that meets the needs of the employer and employee.\n\nAdditional Prohibitions under the PWFA\nThe PWFA also prohibits a covered employer from:\n\nrequiring an employee to accept an accommodation without a discussion about the accommodation between the worker and the employer;\n\ndenying a job or other employment opportunities to a qualified employee or applicant based on the person\u2019s need for a reasonable accommodation;\n\nrequiring an employee to take leave if another reasonable accommodation can be provided that would let the employee keep working; \n\nretaliating against an individual for reporting or opposing unlawful discrimination under the PWFA or participating in a PWFA proceeding (such as an investigation); and\n\ninterfering with any individual\u2019s rights under the PWFA.", "Muni as well!", "Just checked if someone mentioned Austria already.
