One guy at the grocery store dropped his wallet and I was closer so I bent down to pick it up when I was like 8 months and the guy felt SO BAD that I bent to pick it up. I told him it was ok and it was good for me! He was so thankful and felt guilty even though he had no reason to be. I find that people generally treat you as very fragile when you\u2019re pregnant and go out of their way to open doors for you etc. Then when the baby comes and you actually need the door held to push the stroller through they ignore you lol", "They literally said to also ask others...", "Also New York on trains and buses.", "I was imagining spring loaded to remove able bodied people.", "Lol, as soon as I read \"spring loaded\" my mind imagined someone with a push button sending people in the air who sit there and are capable. To give it to someone who needs it. \ud83d\ude02", "That\u2019s a very low probability, but either way, the guy next to OP was an AH for berating her. Not all disabilities are visible and OP could have a disability that she doesn\u2019t want to disclose in public/over the internet (which is very reasonable). It sounds like he could have given up his seat, but chose not to-I don\u2019t know the full story, he could be disabled as well, but he shouldn\u2019t have berated OP when he didn\u2019t give up his seat either", "I\u2019m disabled, and a key symptom is chronic exhaustion due to the amount of pain I\u2019m in every day. If I could stand for longer amounts of time, I would. If the pregnant woman could stand for longer amounts of time without it taking a toll on her and possibly the baby, she would."]}
