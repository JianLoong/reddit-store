We have a 4 year old son who eats the same things as us, so for now is also plant-based.\r  \n\r  \nWe have always said that our goal will be to instill vegan values in him, but that ultimately, once he gets to the age where he starts to have more autonomy, he won't be punished or anything for choosing to consume animal products when presented with the opportunity--that will be his choice. Though of course it would be a (secret) bummer for us, lol. But that's why we refer to him as plant-based rather than vegan, until he chooses that label for himself, basically.\r  \n\r  \nThe rest of our family is not vegan and generally doesn't try to be accommodating regarding that either.

Just little things like that.\r  \n\r  \nANYWAY.\r  \n\r  \nLast weekend we went to a BBQ at a relative's house. Per usual, we brought our own food. Veggie dogs.\r  \n\r  \nMy son was sitting on my MILs lap with his veggie dog and she was eating a (beef) burger. She asked him if he wanted a bite.

My son did not try her burger, ate a few more bites of his veggie dog, and went to play.

Hey, honey, could you pick up some cow on the way home?  Hmmm, let's see, common references are 'cow burgers, cow ribs, cow brisket, cow steak'....\n\nNOT.

This only applies to an animal\u2019s flesh, though, not the blood or organs, which are objectively yucky. \n\nBeef is cow^1, lamb is sheep, pork is pig. Meat animals once have life and preferences and thoughts before they\u2019re killed and eaten. That\u2019s reality, and if you can\u2019t cope with knowing the cost, maybe you shouldn\u2019t eat meat. \n\n^1 Well, it\u2019s cattle, commonly called \u201ccow\u201d even though a cow only refers to female cattle who have been bred - before then, they\u2019re heifers.

Makes me sad how many kids don\u2019t realize til they\u2019re older that beef is cow, pork is pig, etc.  Also, as a vegan who wants to raise my future kids in the same way you\u2019re raising yours, I love to see it!", "NTA\n\nIt was grandma being sneaky not you.

But he specifically asked her \u2018cow or plant?\u2019 And she said \u2018beef\u2019 as if that\u2019s different from cow. She\u2019s the massive AH. And for saying your food is not normal. Such a pretentious AH. \n\nTo explain my perspective, I eat meat. I am aware of all of the downsides for my health, the environment, and the morality of eating meat. I have reconciled with that. I have specific reasons why I eat what I eat. However, I did not give my child meat until he was 3 or 4, though he has eaten dairy since he started eating solid food. In as age appropriate way as I could I explained that chicken to eat is the same type of animal on a farm. He decided if he was ok with eating it. I supported and support him either way. I didn\u2019t want to make that decision for him because there is a morality issue involved. \n\nI also explained some variations of eating lifestyles, vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian etc. and we\u2019ve tried lots of non meat options but he just couldn\u2019t get on board with beans or legumes and protein is a tough one, so he eats a little meat a couple of times a week. \n\nHe\u2019s still a kid, and we still have conversations about different types of meat and what he is and is not ok with consuming. It\u2019s an ongoing process and it is NEVER wrong to provide age appropriate information so kids can make decisions like these. \n\nIt was also ridiculously rude for your in laws to plan a food focused event with a vegan as the guest of honor and not have several vegan options for the guests. When I bring a dish to share I bring the same dish split into vegan and non. (Keep the feta or goat cheese off the salad, whoever wants it can add it that sort of thing).

Glad she spent the rest of the time indoors. She should have been stood in a corner until she apologized.", "NTA\n\nMeats are called different names purely so we can feel better about eating other creatures. It's absolute bullshit. If you don't want to deal with the fact that an animal, in the case of cows intelligent and emotionally aware animals, has died for your meal you shouldn't be eating it.\n\nPersonally I think every package of meat should have a picture of the animal on it, a picture of where it spent its life on the back, and calling it anything but its correct name should be banned. I also think we should make it mandatory to take children to abbatoires on school trips and let them observe the slaughter process. \n\nI'm not vegan at all btw, in case anyone makes assumptions. I was just raised by a mother who thought I should be fully aware of the costs my choices have, and I think that's healthy.", "NTA i was a year older than your son when i saw the infamous Babe movie that helped a lot of people in my generation realize where meat comes from. It's not going to scar him to understand that. Anyone saying y-t-a doesnt realize how sick your son would get from 1 bite of that burger!

And having the mental image of eating a cow will likely prevent that from happening anytime soon. \n\nI am no vegan and don\u2019t have children so I don\u2019t know which way is better. Just that they are different with probably different outcomes.\n\nJust as a question are you working with a child nutritionist or his physician for his diet? \n\nBecause as healthy as vegan based meals are, certain elements can be on the lower ends or missing if not specifically cooked for. That is the hard part about a plant based diet for kids. So it should be under surveillance.", "Reading through the story, I definitely got the feeling she wanted you to make a scene so she could talk about her 'crazy' vegan DIL and how unreasonable you are. Nevermind the fact that feeding meat to a kid who has only eaten vegan food for his entire life is going to do something fun to his digestion (seriously - going from a completely animal-free diet to red meat? Cannot end well), her grandson's pain is a price she's willing to pay, it seems.", "You didn't even comment on how she straight up lied to your kid. You were extremely polite.", "Thank you. I'm not vegan but was raised to know where my food comes from as my dad's side of the family work in agriculture. \n\nI personally believe if you can't stomach killing it and dressing it then you shouldn't be eating it.\n\nAdd: and that goes double for if you can't stand to even acknowledge the source of your \"beef, poultry, pork\". \n\nNTA. You were honest with your kid.", "I mean what's the difference between clarifying that beef is cow and calling chicken...well, chicken? It's the same thing", "That's a big leap from a kid reacting much more gently than I would to someone from a relevant culture offering me a dog burger at his age.", "I absolutely did too, with the instill vegan values in him, but the way they're doing this is by... continuing to be vegan. They're not making other people cook for them, or telling their son that meat eaters are evil or being preachy, they're just... eating vegan food and cooking vegan food for their kid. The kid knowing that beef is just another word for cow shouldn't be some weird secret - that's what beef means, and he'll find out sooner or later, so it's weird for MIL to say \"it's not cow it's beef\".\n\nIf anything, it's the MIL and FIL who think that by feeding a kid a healthy vegan diet they're \"keeping him from normal food\" who are being preachy and controlling. She didn't force her kid not to eat meat, she just told him that it was, in fact, made from a cow.", "My daughter when she was around 5 was very fond of oven-baked trout which are (in my area at least) vacuum-packed as a whole, unlike just slices of salmon or other fish we had sometimes. Not knowing the correct names she always asked me to buy \"the fish with eyes\". It has become a running joke in our home to call trout that. And I was glad she figured out herself that we kill animals for food and I did not need to have the conversation my sister had to have with her children that the chicken-animal and the chicken-food is not a homonym, it's the same chicken...", "By having him eat only vegan, if he were ever to try meat, it is highly likely to just give him a stomach ache as his body isn't used to processing meat, which is a normal thing for humans.\n\nI can only hope OP has consulted a dietician about how to make healthy vegan choices for her kid and not just random internet articles.", "I feel as though that's pretty obvious however I'm replying to this post. Thanks tho", "Wrong. The answer to \"is it cow or veggie\" is not \"no\" it's \"it's beef, which comes from cow.\"  \nThe no makes the MIL a lying word I'm not allowed use on this subreddit.", "This may have been why he was so shocked when he heard it was cow. He'd asked a trusted adult if it was cow and she'd said no. Then he finds out she lied to and betrayed him.\n\nThat's much more shocking than remembering someone eats animals.", "No. OP will be  telling him meat is murder. He was very much making sure the child made the choice he approved of in this situation", "If I'd been raised to think of hamburgers as the meat ripped from cute cows/calves like we do about dog or cat meat I'd probably be vegan. As it is I can see the value in responsible husbandry and eat too much of it tbh, especially pork.  \nThe only difference is cultural normalcy.", "Sorry, there's a lot of people who say \"nobody can tell you how to speak to your child\" as a get out of jail free card, like respect your elders or don't speak ill of the dead. You were targeting it correctly though, mb.", "You\u2019re wrong. Idc what you think about cows or her mother in law.", "Actually, no. Wrong again. \ud83d\ude02 Cows are living animals child. \n\nThe context of beef in English doesn\u2019t require you to say cow. Beef is what you have in a cooked burger.", "I roll my eyes at the \"meat is murder\" crowd as hard as the next man, but this is not that.\n\nPeople have a right to make informed decisions about what they eat, and MIL was deliberately misrepresenting what the burger was made from to a child still learning language and their own ethics.", "Or ox", "Oh yes I know what you mean. I hated hearing respect to the elders while they disrespect you.", "Except you do as shown by how you keep deflecting from the part where she was asked if it was cow and said no.  \nThanks for showing everyone that you're pro deception in general like that for me though. ;)", "Beef is meat taken from a cow carcass. It doesn't cease being cow meat at any point. Saying \"NO\" to asking if it's cow makes them a liar. Sorry sweety, wrong again.", "The child in the post is 4 years old. If they hadn't heard a word, which is likely with how they're being raised, they wouldn't know the context or meaning of the word beef or how to propwrly use it. They are literally 4.\n\nThe grandma could have said \"beef ia made from cow\" rather than straight up saying \"No, not cow, beef\" because the 4 year old probably don't know the word beef. It was intentional.\n\nThe kid is 4, by the way.", "Fun fact: animas can die", "Are you seriously trying to argue that beef isn't cow? You are either making an extremely high minded point about the philosophical nature of existence... Or, as I suspect, you are being deliberately obtuse.", "I didn\u2019t delete anything. Knowingly, at least. \n\nAnd my kid has more important things to do in school than spend time going to visit a slaughterhouse. He knows meat comes from animals. He knows you have to kill one to make meat. What\u2019s the point in wasting even more days to make him watch it? Over half of third graders in this \u201cwonderful\u201d state can\u2019t pass the test to pass 3rd grade. He needs to read and write and know math. He does not need to have a field trip watching something he already knows. If you want to take your child to a slaughterhouse, be my guest. Where I\u2019m from, kids are involved in shooting deer, sometimes slaughtering chickens or other animals, and processing them. They already know. You\u2019re just wanting to take away educational time so you can do your best to make them feel bad. Feel bad all you want. Cows and chickens are food. I\u2019m going to eat them. I\u2019m going to feed them to my children, who aren\u2019t going to feel bad because some sad little Reddit person thinks they should.\n\nEdit: aww. Somebody got their little feelings hurt. Takes a big person to go to the trouble of commenting, and then block the other person before they can even read your response. Why is Reddit full of children.", "You do realize that the concept of a \"sinner\" isn't like universal truth but and ideological concept whereas \"Beef comes from a cow\" is true, regardless wether you think killing animals for food is okay or not, so this comparison really doesn't work. The concept of sin is strictly tied to religion/culture, but beef comes from cow, regardless of the cow's religion or culture.\n\n>He said, \"is it cow or veggie?\" (we eat plenty of veggie burgers, veggie nuggets, etc so he knows to ask what things are made of)\n\n>MIL said \"no honey, it's beef.\"\n\nMIL is clearly trying to make \"chicken the animal vs chicken the food\"-style thing. I personally think that it is good to understand what we are eating and if the thought of eating a cow the animal is horrifying, then one shouldn't eat it nor be tricked to do it.\n\n>She\u2019s clearly directing a child a specific way and influencing them to judge those that don\u2019t agree.\n\nEhh, where is the judgement? I've met several lifetime vegans, some of whom have never, ever eaten meat, and they haven't acted judgemental or anything and have even served non-vegan food for their spouses and children. Being vegan is different from being an asshole.", "There's a very big difference between a factory slaughterhouse and humanely killing a single animal. If we make people aware of the horrible practices of industrial animal farming, a lot more would make the choice to consume meat that has been kept and slaughtered ethically. I don't feel bad when I eat meat, I just appreciate the life of the animal and want it to have a good life.\n\nAnd are you seriously claiming that a single afternoon trip would impact a child's education?\n\nEdit: I've got an app that saves all my notifications, which includes replies on Reddit, deleted or otherwise. I can post a screenshot if you'd really like to look like a tit?", "Wouldn\u2019t it better to educate parents though? Most kids don\u2019t get to choose where their food comes from, some don\u2019t have any say in what they eat at all. My school actually did have a trip to an abattoir, almost the entire grade left crying, vomiting or both. I remember me and some of my friends wanted to stop eating meat, but none of our parents would let us.", "Literally every single parent teaches their child what their values are.\n\nIt\u2019s not possible to be a parent and not share your values with your kid."]}
