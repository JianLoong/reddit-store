We have a 4 year old son who eats the same things as us, so for now is also plant-based.\r  \n\r  \nWe have always said that our goal will be to instill vegan values in him, but that ultimately, once he gets to the age where he starts to have more autonomy, he won't be punished or anything for choosing to consume animal products when presented with the opportunity--that will be his choice. Though of course it would be a (secret) bummer for us, lol. But that's why we refer to him as plant-based rather than vegan, until he chooses that label for himself, basically.\r  \n\r  \nThe rest of our family is not vegan and generally doesn't try to be accommodating regarding that either. For example, my MIL insisted on throwing a bday party for my husband, but then mentioned the morning of that she would be serving pizza, cake, and ice cream (non vegan) and that we should bring our own versions to the party \"if we wanted to eat some.\" Which wouldn't have been unreasonable except for that it was a party she was throwing FOR my husband. Just little things like that.\r  \n\r  \nANYWAY.\r  \n\r  \nLast weekend we went to a BBQ at a relative's house. Per usual, we brought our own food. Veggie dogs.\r  \n\r  \nMy son was sitting on my MILs lap with his veggie dog and she was eating a (beef) burger. She asked him if he wanted a bite.

My son did not try her burger, ate a few more bites of his veggie dog, and went to play. My MIL got up and went inside and I didn't see her for the rest of the BBQ.\r  \n\r  \nLater, my FIL called my husband berating him for allowing me to \"drive a wedge between your mother and her only grandchild by making him think she is an animal killer or something\" (this is close to verbatim), that I can't \"keep him from eating normal food\" forever, and I should apologize. \r  \n\r  \nWe don't think I did anything wrong, but my BIL texted my husband also, said he thinks their parents are overreacting but that I should have not been \"so specific about what beef is\" and that it DOES seem like I was trying to throw my MIL under the bus.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1687393798, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14fod03/aita_for_telling_my_son_his_grandma_eats_cow_not/", "score": 4124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hey, honey, could you pick up some cow on the way home?  Hmmm, let's see, common references are 'cow burgers, cow ribs, cow brisket, cow steak'....\n\nNOT.

This only applies to an animal\u2019s flesh, though, not the blood or organs, which are objectively yucky. \n\nBeef is cow^1, lamb is sheep, pork is pig. Meat animals once have life and preferences and thoughts before they\u2019re killed and eaten. That\u2019s reality, and if you can\u2019t cope with knowing the cost, maybe you shouldn\u2019t eat meat. \n\n^1 Well, it\u2019s cattle, commonly called \u201ccow\u201d even though a cow only refers to female cattle who have been bred - before then, they\u2019re heifers.

Makes me sad how many kids don\u2019t realize til they\u2019re older that beef is cow, pork is pig, etc.  Also, as a vegan who wants to raise my future kids in the same way you\u2019re raising yours, I love to see it!", "NTA\n\nIt was grandma being sneaky not you.

But he specifically asked her \u2018cow or plant?\u2019 And she said \u2018beef\u2019 as if that\u2019s different from cow. She\u2019s the massive AH. And for saying your food is not normal. Such a pretentious AH. \n\nTo explain my perspective, I eat meat. I am aware of all of the downsides for my health, the environment, and the morality of eating meat. I have reconciled with that. I have specific reasons why I eat what I eat. However, I did not give my child meat until he was 3 or 4, though he has eaten dairy since he started eating solid food. In as age appropriate way as I could I explained that chicken to eat is the same type of animal on a farm. He decided if he was ok with eating it. I supported and support him either way. I didn\u2019t want to make that decision for him because there is a morality issue involved. \n\nI also explained some variations of eating lifestyles, vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian etc. and we\u2019ve tried lots of non meat options but he just couldn\u2019t get on board with beans or legumes and protein is a tough one, so he eats a little meat a couple of times a week. \n\nHe\u2019s still a kid, and we still have conversations about different types of meat and what he is and is not ok with consuming. It\u2019s an ongoing process and it is NEVER wrong to provide age appropriate information so kids can make decisions like these. \n\nIt was also ridiculously rude for your in laws to plan a food focused event with a vegan as the guest of honor and not have several vegan options for the guests. When I bring a dish to share I bring the same dish split into vegan and non. (Keep the feta or goat cheese off the salad, whoever wants it can add it that sort of thing).

Glad she spent the rest of the time indoors. She should have been stood in a corner until she apologized.", "NTA\n\nMeats are called different names purely so we can feel better about eating other creatures. It's absolute bullshit. If you don't want to deal with the fact that an animal, in the case of cows intelligent and emotionally aware animals, has died for your meal you shouldn't be eating it.\n\nPersonally I think every package of meat should have a picture of the animal on it, a picture of where it spent its life on the back, and calling it anything but its correct name should be banned. I also think we should make it mandatory to take children to abbatoires on school trips and let them observe the slaughter process. \n\nI'm not vegan at all btw, in case anyone makes assumptions. I was just raised by a mother who thought I should be fully aware of the costs my choices have, and I think that's healthy.", "NTA i was a year older than your son when i saw the infamous Babe movie that helped a lot of people in my generation realize where meat comes from. It's not going to scar him to understand that. Anyone saying y-t-a doesnt realize how sick your son would get from 1 bite of that burger!

How organic that ketchup is I don't know, but overall it was an excellent meal. Though I feel that I proceeded to undo any health part of it by grabbing a vanilla cappuccino afterwards with a cheesecake muffin.", "Thanks for being reasonable about it; this posts whole journey really could\u2019ve taken a turn and I\u2019m thrilled to see it didn\u2019t.", "Yes I'd argue it's deceiving and wrong to hide what meat actually is  -- I grew up with hunted game and was taught the importance of respecting and understanding the sacrifice an animal goes through for us to eat a meal.\n\nIt's absolutely awful to raise a child to believe that their chicken or beef comes from a grocery store shelf.\n\nI admire your choice to be vegan, I'm getting there slowly.", "*CHOCOLATE ice cream no less", "No, MIL should never have offered him the burger. If she knows her son and the child's mother are vegan, and that they are raising him with a vegan diet, it is absolutely a HUGE violation of boundaries.", "You need to explain it to FIL and BIL this way. YOU are not driving the wedge between grandma and grandchild, she is by trying to trick and lie to your child.", "Exactly. Preserving your son's trust in you and modeling integrity and honesty for him by calling out a lie by a loved one, is way more important than your MIL's hurt feelings and outrage. The meat could've made him physically sick as well, since he's not used to it.", "I read your last sentence as \u201cEat it, ham fingers\u201d as though that\u2019s what you were calling the grandma and I liked that.", "Listen... I'm in my thirties now but you'll never take my helicopter SpaghettiOs from me!", "My pediatrician knows my kid is vegan and isn't concerned in the slightest. We saw another pediatrician once because our regular one was booked and she wasn't concerned either. People look at these extreme cases that make the news of people giving their infants homemade flax water or some other nonsense and think that represents all vegans. Yet they ignore the dietary element when a horror story involving omnivorous parents makes the news.", "An cheek spray seems to be working for me at the moment, although skin patches were good too, they were quite costly.", "They come from pickle trees. It's why we hide a pickle in the christmas tree every year. /nod", "no, it doesn't.  Not being vegan means not sharing vegan values, or caring what a vegan thinks about my food.\n\nNothing about a vegan lecture on morality does anything to harm my self-image.", ">any lifestyle that cuts out certain groceries is almost bound to run into issues\n\nThat may be true, but there are way more omnivores who \"cut out certain groceries\" by accident, pickiness, or convenience and don't even realize that they should be looking out for the deficiencies. People who barely eat vegetables, people who feed their kids monotonous beige food because they throw tantrums or refuse to eat, etc. Vegans almost invariably know that one needs to look out for specific nutrients, if not because they were already interested in health and nutrition, then because they constantly hear about it from others. The tired single mom who gives in to macaroni and chicken nuggets for every dinner because she has two other kids that need homework help and laundry done before bedtime - probably not so much. Do you identify and express concern when you see that type of situation as well?\n\nLike... your concern isn't exactly wrong, but out of all the people to whom it might apply, vegans are the *least* likely to be unaware.", "*most diets lack B12 because the source is actually a bacteria in dirt :) and most of us actually wash our produce too well to get it from food. \n\nB12 supplements are a good idea for everyone to take. \n\nAnd your body produces its own vitamin d from about 10 minutes of sunlight daily xx \ud83d\udc9b", "I was 12 too! I had raised a pig i won at the little fair near my hometown and it was my best friend. My family went through a devastating time and I had to live with family further away due to the circumstances. My uncle was left to feed my pig and look after our animals. I guess the pig got out too many times looking for me, and being as I was the only one able to get it back in the pen they made the decision to take her to slaughter. I had no idea of course, no one asks a 12 year old. Anyways, the last I saw her was early December and by the time Christmas Eve rolled around our \u201cadopted\u201d family invited us for breakfast and some gifts. We had eaten all sorts of pig products and at the end of the meal my cousin (10 at the time) leaned in and asked how my pig tasted. Beyond devastated at the point I was hysterical. Never got attached to a farm animal again, couldn\u2019t handle the idea of what happens to them when they\u2019re \u201cripe for the pickin\u201d", "Thanks for literally proving his point by having a temper tantrum. \ud83e\udd23", "Yeah. I have been veg for 30 years and about the 10 year mark I ate something I thought was vegetarian ( so it wasn\u2019t a psychosomatic response) and got violently ill for awhile afterwards. You lose the capacity to eat meat.", "When ever anyone asks me that, I say \u201cmy husband\u201d and stare at them until they get it and are uncomfortable.", "Meh, that goes against the morals and ethics they are trying to teach their child. I don't imagine you'd tell someone who was Jewish or Muslim or Hindu, also people who don't eat certain meat for their own moral reasons, to let their kid try the meat they are opposed to eating just so it didn't look like they were forbidding it.", "My cousin is vegan for health reasons. She\u2019s allergic to dairy and by trying to avoid it, naturally her eating habits evolved into a vegan diet. It\u2019s not something she did on purpose but she says it\u2019s always a relief that she can buy a vegan food product and not worry about potentially throwing it up later.", "If someone can stomach their own slaughter/butchering as do hunters, more power to them, but I'm going to keep outsourcing it, doesn't mean I'm ignorant of the concept", "Had someone do this to me with veal. They convinced me that it was \"just like\" eggplant parmesean, but a different \"form\" of eggplant. I took one bite, and started to take another when the person in question said, \"how's your baby cow?\". I was maybe 10 or 11 at the time. I didn't know what veal was. The worst part is, I thought it was delicious. I beat myself up for months for enjoying \"baby cow\". Didn't vomit or anything, but I haven't eaten it since", "Something like this happened with my mom. Her grandparents had chickens, and she loved them. There was one in particular that was her pet. They killed it and fed it to her, then told her who she had just eaten. She threw it up and cried for hours. She still eats meat, including chicken, but she's never forgotten that. It's been at least 60 years.", "Something similar happened to my partner.\n\nHe'd a pet rooster who he'd trained to come when called.\n\nOne day, his mom gave him some cash and sent him off to play with his buddies.

Once the smug questions came out you always knew they'd tricked you. Totally missing the point. I never said, and you probably didn't either, that I disliked the taste. I said I didn't want to eat it. My dad was always paranoid about me being a secret vegetarian. When I tried veganism for a year I was quick to tell him so just to annoy him. I never mentioned that I stopped lol", "it was delicious, I can\u2019t deny it \ud83d\ude2d", "I even know when it happened for me. I went on a very unhealthy crash diet after high school. One day when I was probably light headed from hunger my mom talked me into eating a banana. It was too much, too rich, and made me sick. I\u2019ve rarely eaten them since. I like banana bread, and I can eat a few pieces on cereals or something, but I tend to avoid them.", "I used to not have an issue with them but after a while I just got sick of their texture and flavor.  Would love the runts bananas.  Same with apples and apple juice.  would eat them for days but I don't know if something changed in my lifetime but can't stand either now.\n\nI've read about how some veggies and fruits have been bred to be more palatable, like brussel sprouts (which I love now) so maybe I just liked the way there were 'back then'\n\nbut food and preferences are weird.  I hate HATE pumpkin pie, makes me gag and its not the allspice.  but love pumpkin soup.", "Honestly the damage you can do if you trick them.. they will find out. There's plenty of ways to manage nutrition. People always bring up nutrients w plant based or vegetarian but who ever goes through the nutritional values of a main stream diet with meat and processed foods? I was given all sorts of processed crap but once I went home made plant based everyone became concerned", "I meant to put it in my comment, but he used it in the hamburger helper. I'm pretty sure I even said it was REALLY good. Like, better than normal. It's just a mental thing, I don't want to eat it. Same reason I won't eat seafood. Everyone tells me how good it tastes, and I'm sure they aren't lying, but I'm not going to try it. And good for you, haha, his annoyance can live on.", "We aren't vegetarian or vegan, but are very clear with our toddler which animals or meat comes from. I remember connecting the dots re: pork and pig, beef and cow, and it bothered me. We want him to know all along. \n\nMIL deliberately used vocabulary he wouldn't understand to trick him. She is definitely the AH here, not OP", "Yeah NTA We're a meat eating family but I don't sugar coat where our food comes from. Although for opposite reasons haha. I don't want them to one day realize they're eating animals and be upset by it. Also access to vegan food is extremely limited in my area as well as very expensive. Meat is easy to come by. I just bought a side of beef from a local farmer in my area and I get chickens from hudderites here too. Good on you for letting your kid choose. What your MIL did wasn't cool, trying to hide the fact that she was eating an animal.", "Everyone should take B-12. A huge percentage of meat eaters are also low on it. My mom has always eaten meat and recently found out hers was so low that she had to get it in shots for a few weeks to get it back up.", "My nephew heard an offhand comment about someone\u2019s husband having a heart attack because he ate too much red meat. At every meal for a year he\u2019d ask if it was \u201cred meat.\u201d Nope buddy - no red meat here.

I\u2019m 26 now and I\u2019ve been a vegetarian since I was 14 (ever since they made us watch Food Inc. and Supersize Me in freshman year health class lol). My best friend\u2019s family growing up were big meat eaters who loved throwing BBQs and all that but they ALWAYS had some veggie burgers and other veggie-friendly options on hand in case I showed up. I practically lived there half the time lol so they kept things around even if they weren\u2019t sure I would be there. Sure they teased me a little (in a loving way) but always respected my choice and were accommodating. I can\u2019t imagine actually formally inviting someone over, let alone hosting a party FOR THEM, and not accommodating them in *some* way.\n\nETA: OP, you are NTA. All you did was enable your son to make an informed choice for himself. I think it\u2019s awesome that you\u2019re educating him and allowing him the space to make his own choices!", "Yes! That's a very important point! Your digestive system adjusts to best handle your normal diet and if you're not routinely eating something (like meat or some types of veggies), you're gonna have a bad time at first.", "They just dislike vegans.

I\u2019ve got a genetic condition that makes it harder to absorb B12. I eat meat almost every day but I\u2019m going to be on B12 supplements until the day I die", "I had a similar but different experience. I was about 4 and my dad and uncle hunted and killed a deer. It was hanging upside down from a tree and I was looking at it and investigating it and asked what it was and my uncle said \"it's Bambi!\" And I freaked out and to try to make it better he said \"no, it's not Bambi just Bambi's mom\" and I freaked out even harder.
