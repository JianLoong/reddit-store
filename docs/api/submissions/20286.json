Though of course it would be a (secret) bummer for us, lol. But that's why we refer to him as plant-based rather than vegan, until he chooses that label for himself, basically.\r  \n\r  \nThe rest of our family is not vegan and generally doesn't try to be accommodating regarding that either.

My son did not try her burger, ate a few more bites of his veggie dog, and went to play.

Hey, honey, could you pick up some cow on the way home?  Hmmm, let's see, common references are 'cow burgers, cow ribs, cow brisket, cow steak'....\n\nNOT.  You are the ones who intentionally misled your kid to not equate the normal, common reference of beef as being cow meat.

This only applies to an animal\u2019s flesh, though, not the blood or organs, which are objectively yucky. \n\nBeef is cow^1, lamb is sheep, pork is pig. Meat animals once have life and preferences and thoughts before they\u2019re killed and eaten. That\u2019s reality, and if you can\u2019t cope with knowing the cost, maybe you shouldn\u2019t eat meat. \n\n^1 Well, it\u2019s cattle, commonly called \u201ccow\u201d even though a cow only refers to female cattle who have been bred - before then, they\u2019re heifers.

Makes me sad how many kids don\u2019t realize til they\u2019re older that beef is cow, pork is pig, etc.  Also, as a vegan who wants to raise my future kids in the same way you\u2019re raising yours, I love to see it!", "NTA\n\nIt was grandma being sneaky not you.

But he specifically asked her \u2018cow or plant?\u2019 And she said \u2018beef\u2019 as if that\u2019s different from cow. She\u2019s the massive AH. And for saying your food is not normal. Such a pretentious AH. \n\nTo explain my perspective, I eat meat. I am aware of all of the downsides for my health, the environment, and the morality of eating meat. I have reconciled with that. I have specific reasons why I eat what I eat. However, I did not give my child meat until he was 3 or 4, though he has eaten dairy since he started eating solid food. In as age appropriate way as I could I explained that chicken to eat is the same type of animal on a farm. He decided if he was ok with eating it. I supported and support him either way. I didn\u2019t want to make that decision for him because there is a morality issue involved. \n\nI also explained some variations of eating lifestyles, vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian etc. and we\u2019ve tried lots of non meat options but he just couldn\u2019t get on board with beans or legumes and protein is a tough one, so he eats a little meat a couple of times a week. \n\nHe\u2019s still a kid, and we still have conversations about different types of meat and what he is and is not ok with consuming. It\u2019s an ongoing process and it is NEVER wrong to provide age appropriate information so kids can make decisions like these. \n\nIt was also ridiculously rude for your in laws to plan a food focused event with a vegan as the guest of honor and not have several vegan options for the guests. When I bring a dish to share I bring the same dish split into vegan and non. (Keep the feta or goat cheese off the salad, whoever wants it can add it that sort of thing).

Glad she spent the rest of the time indoors. She should have been stood in a corner until she apologized.", "NTA\n\nMeats are called different names purely so we can feel better about eating other creatures. It's absolute bullshit. If you don't want to deal with the fact that an animal, in the case of cows intelligent and emotionally aware animals, has died for your meal you shouldn't be eating it.\n\nPersonally I think every package of meat should have a picture of the animal on it, a picture of where it spent its life on the back, and calling it anything but its correct name should be banned. I also think we should make it mandatory to take children to abbatoires on school trips and let them observe the slaughter process. \n\nI'm not vegan at all btw, in case anyone makes assumptions. I was just raised by a mother who thought I should be fully aware of the costs my choices have, and I think that's healthy.", "NTA i was a year older than your son when i saw the infamous Babe movie that helped a lot of people in my generation realize where meat comes from. It's not going to scar him to understand that. Anyone saying y-t-a doesnt realize how sick your son would get from 1 bite of that burger!

Fwiw we did ask them not to offer him any nonvegan stuff when he was smaller, but now that he can speak pretty well, I think MIL assumed it was okay, since I have always said it will be his choice once he is the one deciding what to eat. But I see your point though.", "i agree with this take. It makes me wonder if OP will truly be as open minded as they claim should the kid want to eat meat. I think it may be \u201caccepted\u201d but with enough side eye the kid won\u2019t want to.", "My kids (3 & 5) have eaten meat their whole lives and still sometimes have trouble with the beef=cow pork=pig thing, and I have explained it to them multiple times before. So if someone offered my kid a bite of something and told them it\u2019s \u201cbeef\u201d and they looked confused I would say the same thing \u201cbeef is cow\u201d, not to convince them not to eat it, but so that they could make an educated decision about whether they wanted to or not, and so that they\u2019re knowledgeable about what they\u2019re putting into their bodies. It\u2019s normal for you to connect beef=cow because you\u2019ve been taught it your whole life, a 4 year old needs to be taught what words mean.", "Good catch! That \"he will not be punished\" is a weird sentiment to think in relation to a small child and food choices, no matter how you spin it.", "Maybe I am crazy, but I have to agree somewhat. They have instilled their vegan values, which is their choice. Grandma called the burger beef, she could also called it a hamburger. Most of the people in the world do not refer to it as \"cow.\"  I going go with ESH though.  Grandma knew what she was doing also.", "If you actually did read the rest you might have a different answer.I went in somewhat expecting to say Y T A but was wrong completely.", "lol what? why?", "Yes, let\u2019s be overly dramatic about food. You want to name my cheeseburger? Cool. Matilda tastes amazing. So did Jacob the chicken. I\u2019m glad you asked.", "The cow didn\u2019t stop being a cow when it was killed for food. And you\u2019ve totally missed something huge by complaining that no kid would eat meat if they realized it was animals.", "Well that\u2019s patently not true. My 3&5 year olds know which animal their meat comes from, and it doesn\u2019t bother them in the slightest. I mean which 4 year old hasn\u2019t worked out that chicken is chicken??", "No.", "Oh my god, how will he survive?", "Nope, not lying. The english language distinguishes between the live animal and the meat produced from the dead animal. The thing in front of the kid was the dead animal meat product, not a living breathing animal. Lying requires an untrue statement, calling it beef was not untrue.", "Wrong. Beef is a word used to describe meat in her burger.", "It took me way too long to understand this comment \ud83d\ude06", "I think you did, too. MiL doesn't like how it went, because she ended up looking bad. So she's trying to make that your fault, somehow.", "You honestly didn\u2019t even react at all. You answered your sons question in a way you knew he\u2019d understand. Reacting would\u2019ve been saying \u201cdon\u2019t eat that it\u2019s cow!\u201d Or getting mad at your MIL for offering meat to your child when she knows you\u2019d disagree. You had every right to tell her off but you didn\u2019t, you calmly offered your son information and let him make his own decision which he did. She\u2019s upset because she\u2019s guilty and was hoping your son would try it, like it, and she could have a reason to tell you you should be feeding your son meat because he wants it.", "You acted right and honestly. I have no idea what she expected.", "I thought you did too.  I eat meat and I have said the exact same thing to my kid to clarify what beef is.  She is upset you all are vegan and is trying to control it. It's her,  not you.   Who plans a party for someone with food they won't eat?!  If I know in advance, I always have food my guests can eat in general, but can't imagine buying animal products for a vegan guest of honor.", "I wouldn\u2019t eat vegan food if it was one of those substitutes. Vegetables are awesome. Vegetables pretending to be a chicken nugget or a cheeseburger? No. Same for the fake cheeses and that stuff. I\u2019ve got a couple vegan friends and several vegetarian friends and family members, so I\u2019ve tried a lot of the substitutes. But there is no reason there can\u2019t be both options. \n\nI guess at least they warned them there would be no vegan food? Somewhat better than the people having celebrations and not warning the vegans or vegetarians that there would be nothing for them to eat. Still terrible people.", "Oh you magnificent bastard you.", "Rawwwwwwhiiiide!", "Trying to trick a four year old is wrong, I agree.", "Even then, a lot of people will use cow to mean cattle, rather than specifically a female of the species.", "I think they mostly don\u2019t trust you\u2019ll really let 5 make his own choice later. But that\u2019s not on you.", "I\u2019m not really sure why it would scar you for life. Most kids I know, mine included, know that their hamburger used to be a cow, or their chicken nuggets were chickens. I\u2019d only think it would be scarring if you made some huge deal out of it.", "Yeah, it\u2019s not like you told him the grizzly details of how the cow becomes a burger. It\u2019s not much different from saying pickles are cucumbers.", "Issue is not with the child's understanding. Issue is with OP claiming intentions, when it's obvious they have referred to the meat aka beef to only cow. It's not uncommon for a kid to be confused until a certain point about 'chicken the animal/chicken the food' for example. But this is not the same at all. OP has purposely referred to beef as cow which is not the norm in terminology, then twisted the accusation. \n\nRegardless, I could let that all go, but not the \"he wouldn't be punished\" comment.", "Are you sure? Or was grandma just \"testing the waters\" ?\n\nFrom what OP says, that should not have been a problem. \n\nUntil you consider the \"he would not be punished\" part.", "Imagine being a Christian\u2026.you\u2019re raising your son to be Christian. At a get together, your son\u2019s friend asks your cousin to hang out on Sunday. He says \u201cwe have to go to church, are you a sinner?\u201d\u2026.friend responds \u201cI don\u2019t go to church often\u201d you interrupt \u201che\u2019s a sinner honey\u201d\n\nAlthough it may be the truth, what\u2019s the intent behind your words? It\u2019s a sort of clear attempt to pursuance your son a certain direction. Idk if I\u2019d say YTA, but I\u2019d lean more that way than not. I see this no different than hardcore religious families. You act like he has freedom of choice, but you\u2019re certainly forcing him a direction. He thinks it\u2019s gross to eat cow because you told him that.", "How is it overdramatic to call beef 'cow' and be aware of the process of consuming meat?\n\nWhy is it bad to at least respect the animals we consume?", "Every kid I know knows that meat is animals, so I really don\u2019t think they\u2019re missing the huge something you think they are. This particular kid won\u2019t eat meat when he realizes it\u2019s animals because his parents have conditioned him not to.", "I didn't say \"no kid,\" and even italicized what I did say", "Yes", "Not the point, at all.", "Yes, lying. MIL didn't just say that it was beef, she denied that it was cow. It is not \"a\" cow, but it is cow. It is ALSO beef, and more accurately it is called beef, but it is absolutely a lie to say that it isn't cow.", "Then she should have explained that new word properly. \u201eYeah, this meat comes from a cow, but when the cow is dead we call it beef!\u201c MIL tried to introduce that word to hide the fact that it was once a cow. Her intentions are pretty clear.", "Bull \ud83d\udc02", "Yeah, at least they were warned. Still shitty, I agree.", ":-D", "I was being sarcastic, I should have used a tone indicator! My bad!", "She teaches her son that they do not eat cow/beef for xyz reasons because that is what is true for her family, the same way I explain to my kids that we eat animal products for the reasons I choose to feed my family animal products. If they were Hindu and she was teaching her child that they do not eat cow for that religions specific reasons would you still have a problem with how she chooses to teach her child about food? Parents have the right to teach their own children whatever beliefs they want. She\u2019s not abusing her child.\n\nShe was clarifying that she will not punish her son for choosing not to be vegan, probably because people like you assume all vegans are psychos who will disown their family for eating animal products. She probably felt the need to word it that way because people around her assume she would be super controlling and psycho about it and has had to defend to decision to multiple people already.", "Yeah, the whole thing seems a bit off. They are really zealous about it.", "This is nonsense because non Christians being sinners is an opinion and beef being cow is a fact", "This is actually a pretty good analogy. They do have the right to raise their kid the way they want, unless it hurts the child.  I wonder what their kid thinks of people who eat \"cow.\" This is the real question. Are they teaching him grandma is not a good person for eating \"cow\" or will he think that because of their beliefs?", "Analogy doesn\u2019t make sense. All Christians would say that they too are sinners. The opposite of Christian isn\u2019t sinner. It\u2019s\u2026 non-Christian.", "That is not the dramatic part. \u201cEvery child must go to the slaughterhouse and watch the animals be killed\u201d and \u201cthere should be a picture of the animal on every package of meat\u201d? That is the dramatic part.", "She said \"no, it's beef\". If she said \"it is not a cattle byproduct\" then it would be lie. Saying it's beef is not the lie and no judge would say it was.", "Not to a Christian\u2026that\u2019s the point. And cows are food to non vegans.", "Yeah, raise your child how you want, by all means. I just think it\u2019s disingenuous to act like they clearly aren\u2019t instilling specific values and he has \u201cfree choice\u201d. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s old enough to start associating those who eat meat with the disgust, but he is certainly disgusted by the meat. I\u2019m sure he will have a faze of that and then school will come and he may change due to peers and the normalization of meat eating.", "I didn\u2019t say whether Christians are or aren\u2019t sinners or what they believe they are. I said what non church goers are. Which is sinners. You can choose to not comprehend. Idc either way, the comparison stands. She\u2019s clearly directing a child a specific way and influencing them to judge those that don\u2019t agree. It\u2019s funny to me how people would bash her if she was Christian but allow it because it\u2019s vegan. Both are doing the EXACT same thing.", "It's dramatic to think people should understand what happens for them to eat meat? \n\nIf you're willing to eat it but not watch it happen, that's kind of just pathetic imo.", "Oh, and in reply to that comment you deleted:\n\nYes. We absolutely should make people aware of the conditions in sweatshops from a young age. I think the willful ignorance of these things is largely what enables companies to commit horrible acts against both humans and animals, and they absolutely should be shamed for it.\n\n\"Don't tell the children about the slaves or they might start to question the merits of fast and disposable consumption\". I'd fucking delete that as well.", "The question was is it cow or veggie. The answer to \"is it cow\" is yes. Saying no to that question is a lie. I'm not saying that saying it is beef is a lie (as I pointed out already), I'm saying that answering no to \"is this cow\" is a lie.", "Yes\u2026\u2026.but they are still cows. Beef means dead cows, regardless if you choose to eat them or not.", "She said they are giving him freedom to choose not that they aren't doing what literally every parent ever does which is instilling in them their own values.", "How much you wanna bet they home school him??", "Yes, my point being you\u2019re not allowing much free choice when the \u201cnon church goer is a sinner\u201d.", "Except they quite literally are allowing free choice but at the same time advising against it.  \n\n\nThis is contrary to things like stealing and drinking and doing drugs which most people not only advise against but also punish their kids if they get caught doing any of them.", "Yes, and my cousin\u2019s grandma was giving him free choice to go to church/participate in her religion or not, but she certainly made sure to inform a child that his mommy was going to burn in hell. \u201cAllowing and advising against\u201d is not \u201cfree choice\u201d. It\u2019s coercive. Which, it\u2019s their kid, whatever. As long as he\u2019s not being starved or something I really don\u2019t care what he does or doesn\u2019t eat. But don\u2019t pretend like it\u2019s an actual \u201cchoice\u201d for him. \n\nIf you grow up and your whole life your parents have told you something is bad, you\u2019re most likely going to think the same. Look at all the 4-8 year old racist kids. I know several whose parents never told them they can\u2019t play with the little black boy. But they sure made it a point to make sure their kid knows that black people are dirty and mean and whatever else. \n\nSo by telling him the things they think are so wrong about eating meat, they are convincing him to think it is terrible as well. How is there a choice when they have literally chosen how he will think of it?"]}
