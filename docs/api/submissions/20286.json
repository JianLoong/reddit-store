We have a 4 year old son who eats the same things as us, so for now is also plant-based.\r  \n\r  \nWe have always said that our goal will be to instill vegan values in him, but that ultimately, once he gets to the age where he starts to have more autonomy, he won't be punished or anything for choosing to consume animal products when presented with the opportunity--that will be his choice. Though of course it would be a (secret) bummer for us, lol. But that's why we refer to him as plant-based rather than vegan, until he chooses that label for himself, basically.\r  \n\r  \nThe rest of our family is not vegan and generally doesn't try to be accommodating regarding that either.

Just little things like that.\r  \n\r  \nANYWAY.\r  \n\r  \nLast weekend we went to a BBQ at a relative's house. Per usual, we brought our own food. Veggie dogs.\r  \n\r  \nMy son was sitting on my MILs lap with his veggie dog and she was eating a (beef) burger. She asked him if he wanted a bite.

My son did not try her burger, ate a few more bites of his veggie dog, and went to play.

Hey, honey, could you pick up some cow on the way home?  Hmmm, let's see, common references are 'cow burgers, cow ribs, cow brisket, cow steak'....\n\nNOT.

This only applies to an animal\u2019s flesh, though, not the blood or organs, which are objectively yucky. \n\nBeef is cow^1, lamb is sheep, pork is pig. Meat animals once have life and preferences and thoughts before they\u2019re killed and eaten. That\u2019s reality, and if you can\u2019t cope with knowing the cost, maybe you shouldn\u2019t eat meat. \n\n^1 Well, it\u2019s cattle, commonly called \u201ccow\u201d even though a cow only refers to female cattle who have been bred - before then, they\u2019re heifers.

Makes me sad how many kids don\u2019t realize til they\u2019re older that beef is cow, pork is pig, etc.  Also, as a vegan who wants to raise my future kids in the same way you\u2019re raising yours, I love to see it!", "NTA\n\nIt was grandma being sneaky not you.

But he specifically asked her \u2018cow or plant?\u2019 And she said \u2018beef\u2019 as if that\u2019s different from cow. She\u2019s the massive AH. And for saying your food is not normal. Such a pretentious AH. \n\nTo explain my perspective, I eat meat. I am aware of all of the downsides for my health, the environment, and the morality of eating meat. I have reconciled with that. I have specific reasons why I eat what I eat. However, I did not give my child meat until he was 3 or 4, though he has eaten dairy since he started eating solid food. In as age appropriate way as I could I explained that chicken to eat is the same type of animal on a farm. He decided if he was ok with eating it. I supported and support him either way. I didn\u2019t want to make that decision for him because there is a morality issue involved. \n\nI also explained some variations of eating lifestyles, vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian etc. and we\u2019ve tried lots of non meat options but he just couldn\u2019t get on board with beans or legumes and protein is a tough one, so he eats a little meat a couple of times a week. \n\nHe\u2019s still a kid, and we still have conversations about different types of meat and what he is and is not ok with consuming. It\u2019s an ongoing process and it is NEVER wrong to provide age appropriate information so kids can make decisions like these. \n\nIt was also ridiculously rude for your in laws to plan a food focused event with a vegan as the guest of honor and not have several vegan options for the guests. When I bring a dish to share I bring the same dish split into vegan and non. (Keep the feta or goat cheese off the salad, whoever wants it can add it that sort of thing).

Glad she spent the rest of the time indoors. She should have been stood in a corner until she apologized.", "NTA\n\nMeats are called different names purely so we can feel better about eating other creatures. It's absolute bullshit. If you don't want to deal with the fact that an animal, in the case of cows intelligent and emotionally aware animals, has died for your meal you shouldn't be eating it.\n\nPersonally I think every package of meat should have a picture of the animal on it, a picture of where it spent its life on the back, and calling it anything but its correct name should be banned. I also think we should make it mandatory to take children to abbatoires on school trips and let them observe the slaughter process. \n\nI'm not vegan at all btw, in case anyone makes assumptions. I was just raised by a mother who thought I should be fully aware of the costs my choices have, and I think that's healthy.", "NTA i was a year older than your son when i saw the infamous Babe movie that helped a lot of people in my generation realize where meat comes from. It's not going to scar him to understand that. Anyone saying y-t-a doesnt realize how sick your son would get from 1 bite of that burger!

It was also misleading.\n\nYou know...two things at once?", "No, it's not that the kid is too young to choose..it's that OP is specifically conditioning him one way while trying to claim the kid can make a 'free choice' later in his life.\n\nThat's just hypocritical.", "MIL said \"no\", which was a lie. End of story.", "\u201cIs it cow or veggie?\u201d It\u2019s cow\n\n\u201cNo honey, it\u2019s beef\u201d still cow\n\nShe lied by trying to imply beef isn\u2019t cow. not once did she tell the truth. The \u201cno\u201d is a lie in itself. She tried to lie to this child to trick him into eating it, which I agree with you on this. Trying to trick someone like this is a lie. It\u2019s not honest. If she was trying to be honest, she would have straight up said \u201choney it\u2019s cow, also known as beef.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t have said no to his question.", "It IS a lie to say beef isn't cow. Explain to me how beef isn't cow.", "But it wasn't truthful. Because beef IS cow. I don't understand the point you are making.", "That\u2019s exactly what parents do when raising their kids non-vegan though. They\u2019re just less likely on average than OP to accept it if their kid changes their mind.", "But how is that any different from anyone else? Parents and society constantly condition kids *all the time.* Meat eating being one example.\n\nWhat would you want OP to do exactly? Not instill her own values on their kid? Teaching them the opposite in some vague sense of centrism? \n\nAnd even if you'd want that, it's redundant. Their own family and broader society will do the exact opposite conditioning you're accusing OP of. A 4 year old will follow parents obviously, but the older the kid gets, the less influence parents have.\n\nOP's policy is as much as one might expect from a parent concerning a value they hold dearly."]}
