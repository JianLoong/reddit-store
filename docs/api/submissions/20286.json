We have a 4 year old son who eats the same things as us, so for now is also plant-based.\r  \n\r  \nWe have always said that our goal will be to instill vegan values in him, but that ultimately, once he gets to the age where he starts to have more autonomy, he won't be punished or anything for choosing to consume animal products when presented with the opportunity--that will be his choice. Though of course it would be a (secret) bummer for us, lol. But that's why we refer to him as plant-based rather than vegan, until he chooses that label for himself, basically.\r  \n\r  \nThe rest of our family is not vegan and generally doesn't try to be accommodating regarding that either.

Just little things like that.\r  \n\r  \nANYWAY.\r  \n\r  \nLast weekend we went to a BBQ at a relative's house. Per usual, we brought our own food. Veggie dogs.\r  \n\r  \nMy son was sitting on my MILs lap with his veggie dog and she was eating a (beef) burger. She asked him if he wanted a bite.

My son did not try her burger, ate a few more bites of his veggie dog, and went to play. My MIL got up and went inside and I didn't see her for the rest of the BBQ.\r  \n\r  \nLater, my FIL called my husband berating him for allowing me to \"drive a wedge between your mother and her only grandchild by making him think she is an animal killer or something\" (this is close to verbatim), that I can't \"keep him from eating normal food\" forever, and I should apologize. \r  \n\r  \nWe don't think I did anything wrong, but my BIL texted my husband also, said he thinks their parents are overreacting but that I should have not been \"so specific about what beef is\" and that it DOES seem like I was trying to throw my MIL under the bus.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1687393798, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14fod03/aita_for_telling_my_son_his_grandma_eats_cow_not/", "score": 312, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hey, honey, could you pick up some cow on the way home?  Hmmm, let's see, common references are 'cow burgers, cow ribs, cow brisket, cow steak'....\n\nNOT.  You are the ones who intentionally misled your kid to not equate the normal, common reference of beef as being cow meat.

Who gets offended by the meaning of basic words?", "NTA he\u2019s 4 and of course doesn\u2019t understand what beef is and where it comes from.

This only applies to an animal\u2019s flesh, though, not the blood or organs, which are objectively yucky. \n\nBeef is cow^1, lamb is sheep, pork is pig. Meat animals once have life and preferences and thoughts before they\u2019re killed and eaten. That\u2019s reality, and if you can\u2019t cope with knowing the cost, maybe you shouldn\u2019t eat meat. \n\n^1 Well, it\u2019s cattle, commonly called \u201ccow\u201d even though a cow only refers to female cattle who have been bred - before then, they\u2019re heifers.

Makes me sad how many kids don\u2019t realize til they\u2019re older that beef is cow, pork is pig, etc.  Also, as a vegan who wants to raise my future kids in the same way you\u2019re raising yours, I love to see it!", "NTA\n\nIt was grandma being sneaky not you. If he said - what is it? And she said \u2018hamburger\u2019 or \u2018beef\u2019 that\u2019s one thing. But he specifically asked her \u2018cow or plant?\u2019 And she said \u2018beef\u2019 as if that\u2019s different from cow. She\u2019s the massive AH. And for saying your food is not normal. Such a pretentious AH. \n\nTo explain my perspective, I eat meat. I am aware of all of the downsides for my health, the environment, and the morality of eating meat. I have reconciled with that. I have specific reasons why I eat what I eat. However, I did not give my child meat until he was 3 or 4, though he has eaten dairy since he started eating solid food. In as age appropriate way as I could I explained that chicken to eat is the same type of animal on a farm. He decided if he was ok with eating it. I supported and support him either way. I didn\u2019t want to make that decision for him because there is a morality issue involved. \n\nI also explained some variations of eating lifestyles, vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian etc. and we\u2019ve tried lots of non meat options but he just couldn\u2019t get on board with beans or legumes and protein is a tough one, so he eats a little meat a couple of times a week. \n\nHe\u2019s still a kid, and we still have conversations about different types of meat and what he is and is not ok with consuming. It\u2019s an ongoing process and it is NEVER wrong to provide age appropriate information so kids can make decisions like these. \n\nIt was also ridiculously rude for your in laws to plan a food focused event with a vegan as the guest of honor and not have several vegan options for the guests. When I bring a dish to share I bring the same dish split into vegan and non. (Keep the feta or goat cheese off the salad, whoever wants it can add it that sort of thing).

Glad she spent the rest of the time indoors. She should have been stood in a corner until she apologized.", "NTA\n\nMeats are called different names purely so we can feel better about eating other creatures. It's absolute bullshit. If you don't want to deal with the fact that an animal, in the case of cows intelligent and emotionally aware animals, has died for your meal you shouldn't be eating it.\n\nPersonally I think every package of meat should have a picture of the animal on it, a picture of where it spent its life on the back, and calling it anything but its correct name should be banned. I also think we should make it mandatory to take children to abbatoires on school trips and let them observe the slaughter process. \n\nI'm not vegan at all btw, in case anyone makes assumptions. I was just raised by a mother who thought I should be fully aware of the costs my choices have, and I think that's healthy.", "NTA i was a year older than your son when i saw the infamous Babe movie that helped a lot of people in my generation realize where meat comes from. It's not going to scar him to understand that. Anyone saying y-t-a doesnt realize how sick your son would get from 1 bite of that burger!

He was trying to show how nothing was wasted on the farm.\n\nMy friend went into hysterics, however, ran to the bathroom, made herself throw up, and went off the rails, crying to call her mom.  She said she was sick for days.

In this case the kid asked what it was and, while seemingly confused, didn't ask to clarify what 'beef' was (mom explained it without him prompting). \n\nMaybe it's nbd but it does seem like if the parents are trying to raise him with vegan values, or just knowing the difference, they need to use the words he's actually going to hear/see when encountering food.\n\nEta: obviously mom is nta and grandma is here.
