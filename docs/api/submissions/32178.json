But you could become an asshole about this, depending on how you choose to react. Some people are just really bad at gifts. Some people are really disorganised. However, if the lateness is a regular thing, I think it\u2019s fine to tactfully bring this up with them and calmly let them know you find it a bit annoying. But some people are just really bad at time-management. It\u2019s probably not personal.", "NTA for feeling disappointed, but it\u2019s been my experience as I\u2019ve gotten older that friends don\u2019t really do birthday gifts. You might go out for dinner or drinks, maybe pick up your friend\u2019s tab if it\u2019s their day, but that\u2019s it. So you might need to adjust your expectations a bit.", "Friendships shouldn't be transactional, but being silently disappointed doesn't make you an asshole. Some people are good at gift giving, some aren't. It may be your love language, but not hers. You're young, so something you should learn about growing up is that *most* people don't care about your birthday as much as you do.\n\nYour gift to her was nice, and she appreciated it. I'd be happy that she's happy, not be expecting something of equal value. Learn to get joy from the joy of others and appreciate what you do receive.\n\nIf you didn't express your disappointment to her, NAH.", "NTAH.  You're not disappointed in the gift.  You're disappointed with the friend.", "NTA. My friend of over 30 years is a bad gift giver. Kind & considerate always, but her gifts are just meh.   Stuff I wouldn't give to a 10 year old.  I know my love language is gift giving,  spending time choosing something really special for the recipient. \n\n& she's not the only one that disappoints with their gift. But, that's a me issue.  I'll never say anything as her friendship is more valuable & she would be hurt if I expressed her gift was lacking.", "YWBTA if you acted on those feelings, but people can't really help how they feel about stuff.\n\nBut yeah, if this friend doesn't really care about gift exchanging, then just drop it and don't put all these thoughts into giftmaking. Ruining a friendship over this would be an AH move, you now know where you both stand on the birthday gifts situation, so you can gift her some chocolates the next year, maybe make this a tradition for you and your friend!\n\nYou're both young, all this is gonna seem pointless 5 years from now, just relax and do yourself a favour: don't ruin your day by thinking about stuff like this", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She met with my yesterday for her birthday and she gave me box of chocolates which were relatively cheap and throughout the metering kept telling me how much she loved the gifts I had bought her. The chocolate she gave me she had bought a bit before would meeting where she sent me a text asking which chocolates I would prefer so she hadn't even put much thought into this. She was also half an hour late and hadn't even thought about telling me.\n\nI feel rather disappointed in her gift and know she has no money constraints.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
