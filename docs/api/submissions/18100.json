It was alright the first time. Wouldn\u2019t do it again. The kids were exhausted too. \n\nThis has caused several arguments within the span of two days.

Also, hanging up a phone call on your behalf is messed up. Sounds like a large toddler", "OP this borders on abuse, both physical and emotional.  For him to make these demands and grab the phone physically from you, you definitely need to not only contact attorney as suggested but also research all of the family finances covertly without his knowledge.

If I were you I\u2019d be having a good think to see if this behaviour is out of character or if he\u2019s like this more than you realise.

This will also most likely lead to your husband complaining about how no one is happy. No one will be happy at Disney. \n\nHe doesn't like your parents? Big deal. I find it tends to be rare that other people like their in-laws. He should be able to suffer while you and your kids have fin in Greece with your family like you did last year at Disney.\n\nThe phone destruction is a bit of a red flag.

No one established you are going to Disneyland what he is doing is controlling and emotionally abusive.", "NTA\n\nAs a husband, I'm concerned for your safety.

Physical violence has no place in a healthy marriage.\n\nJust a suggestion from experience, put together an escape bag and keep it somewhere away from the home.\n\nMadam, his behavior is concerning.

And no, you don't force three people (including both children!) to go to Disneyland when they don't want to.\n\nAt this point I'd say take your kids and go to Greece. Get away now. Give him the time to sort himself out (ideally with a therapist) and decide if he wants to be there when you get home.\n\nThis trip is only a symptom of a much bigger problem. He wants to be the king of the household, and respects no other opinions.

I don't think any of you are safe in that home.", "'He takes it out on the 12 year old.' This alone makes you an AH! You should have stopped that the first time he did it! I can't believe you're letting him get away with this, that poor child, my heart absolutely breaks for them.", "Your husband is verbally and emotionally abusive.\n\nStay safe.\n\nNTA.", "The very worst thing you can do is let him get his way Again. That teaches him that he can scare you to get what he wants. Toxic! \n\nDoesn't he know how to Take Turns? \n\nPlan a trip to Greece for you and your kids and let him do Disney solo.", "May not be TA but I seriously doubt that the 3 year old is demanding a trip to Greece to see his grandparents that he hasn't seen in years. The 12 year old is probably pretty maniable. You seem to be quite bossy and you have bigger problems than a vacation destination", "You, my dear, **are in an abusive relationship.** You see it, but you don't see it.

He not only takes his anger out on you but ON YOUR CHILD  \nYou need to get out of this situation now. Start with the Domestic Abuse Hotline. Talk to a friend or relative who can offer you shelter.

Does he own any guns?\n\nAlso: it's not ok for him to be grabbing your phone and damaging it on purpose. What changed when he started acting like this towards you?", "Honey.....\n\nYour marriage is already over. He doesn't respect you. He doesn't care what you want. And he flat out said he would rather go to DL with other people.\n\nYTA if you stay", "OH well your husband is abusive and you should gtfo of there. Divorce seems like a good option!\n\nHe doesn't get to scream at your over a holiday choice, especially when the rest of the family doesn't want to go to Fing Disneyland.", "\"I\u2019m only putting up with this because I feel like if I try to divorce him, shit will really hit the fan and he\u2019ll do something crazy.\"\n\nI would make preparations to escape if need be.

What about you kids?\n\nYou need to leave. And you need to leave in silence. Don't tell your husband your plans. Just go.

Don't teach her to be a victim who puts up with anything to avoid being single. From what you've said about his temper...you're technically a single mom already. He's flirting with women, denying it, threatening you, yelling at your kids, isolating you from your parents and breaking your phone which is your way to communicate your ass out of his prison. Do you not realize that he broke your phone to keep you away from your parents? He doesn't want you to have a way out!", "Look, as a kid whose parents tolerated each other and were largely not abusive to each other... I was still glad when my parents finally split. The tension at every family dinner, vacations, etc...\n\nJust go. And be safe when you do.", "It reminds me of how my abusive family pretends everything is fine. To him if you all go to disneyland that is a \"proper\", fairytale family vacation. He is avoiding the reality that he needs to fix the relationship and his parenting. \n\nI would say have the kids tell him they want to go to Greece but I am scared that will make him be abusive to your kids", "Did he meet someone? Who are these better people? A second family?", "so it's okay that he is abusive to your 12 yr old but now that it's you, you have a problem?", "Oh. That's why the \"how do they treat the waiter\" test is a good one. If he screams and is abusive to other people, he'll eventually do the same to you. If he had never been like this to anyone I would say get him to a doctor to be scanned for a brain tumor, but nope, sounds like this is who he really is. You have done nothing wrong, but you need to grab your kids and leave him.", "Haven't you read the part where he shouts with her nonstop, the part where she's scared of what he might do or the part where he's abusive towards the 12 yo ? Is Disney really the problem here ?", "Sounds like he might have NPD. Men with NPD tend to act like giant babies when they don\u2019t get their way.", "You shouldn't be scared of your partner. \n\nYour *kids* shouldn't be scared of their *dad.* \n\nThere shouldn't be 3 members of your family walking on eggshells and never getting what they want just so your husband can live his shitty fantasy.", "Not to be too harsh but your kids need at least one parent who will prioritize their safety. It's clearly not gonna be him. It's gonna have to be you. Thinking that behavior is something you talk about and not leave over is the problem now.", "you're a horrible mom for allowing your child to be abused. your husband is abusive. gtfo", "Yeah so stop letting it go on wtf?? Get your kids out of there", "Honestly, you need to get yourself and your children away from him today. He is abusive and you are already fearing he may turn violent. Why are you waiting until it becomes physical to make the right decision? If he hits your children, will you still have to think about it?", "I wish you a lot of luck and a lot of strength.  Sometimes these things happen to give us perspective that we haven\u2019t been able to see for a while.  But you and your kids deserve better!", "Ok but this massive shift in personality? And fixation on stuff\u2014. Dude needs to go to a doctor stat.   This is like bran tumor weird. \n\nIf he\u2019s just an ass then get a divorce", "National abuse hotline: (800) 799-7233", "You need the other parents\u2019 permission to take kids out of the US unless they are dead or you have full custody.", "right? like, is he having a long distance affair with Minnie and is desperate to see her again?\n\napart from all the other red flags, the stubborn, insistent obsession with Disneyland is bizarre. i get that Disney Adults exist, but this sounds like a weird fixation.", "No idea..", "I thought he meant instead of making memories in Greece with the in-laws that he doesn't like, he \"deserve\" to make memories with people he likes aka wife and kids.", "This was my first thought but I feel like it's hard to disappear on a your first family for any significant amount of time cause Disneyland is sooooo family oriented. But who knows, desperate people find a way.", "Noooo, of course not. You don\u2019t think it breaks my heart seeing that? I\u2019m trying my best, I really am. I just need to be much stronger and after all these replies, I need to do something.", "Yep. My ex was JUST like this. He was terrifying and abhorrent when he didn't get his own (often very unreasonable) way.", "You don\u2019t think I know that??", "It\u2019s crazy to me because our first trip to Disneyland was literally our first time going and all of a sudden, he\u2019s obsessed.", "From the OP's story, it doesn't sound like he actually likes his wife and kids. They are just NPCs in his adventure.", "When I was a kid my father acted just like your husband. I begged my mom to leave but she wouldn't. I moved out as soon as I could and have not spoken to my father since. My father then found a new wife and left my mother. \n\nBeing a mother who acknowledges and tolerates her child being abused will not only affect your child and his future relationships, but it will ultimately affect your relationship with him in the future. I still blame my mother for staying as long as she did and letting him pick on me. Now that you've typed that he picks on your son, if you allow it to continue you are just as guilty as he is.", "Please speak with your parents and tell them everything. It sounds like you are still close despite him trying to isolate them from you. Abusers love to do that so their victims have no way out. \n\nMaybe your parents can come and help you get out with a police escort", "The problem is that the husband won't even have a conversation about it. Everytime she tries to bring it up he starts swearing and screaming. She can't compromise if the other party refuses to do so.", "If OP can't get a word in, how can they compromise? OP also says her mother told her to have a conversation and decide on something they both want to do, and he took the phone from her hands, hung up on her mother, and verbally abused her to the point of her and her children's tears. He has a right to not want to go visit his in-laws but he does not have a right to treat his family this way.", "take the kids to Greece and let him go to Disneyland by himself, lol. god, he sounds like such an insufferable loser.", "My ex husband was like this as well. MAJOR red flag! Like a whole ass parade!", "Sorry, I had a bad childhood and I managed to not abuse other people. It\u2019s not an excuse. He wants to control you. He doesn\u2019t respect you and now you are afraid of physical violence. Please get help for you and your kids to plan to leave.", "Take the kids and go to a friends house. Stay there until you can get to Greece to see your parents. This is not a safe environment for you and the fact he flirts with other women, in front of you or not, shows he does not deserve you and you do not deserve to be treated this way.", "So why haven't you taken your child away from your disgusting husband? You're as much the AH as your husband is for allowing your poor child to be your husband's victim. I can't even begin to tell you how much damage you & your husband have already done to your daughter.", "I also want to add this isn't your fault! It takes a while to gain insight. But now that you have, it's up to you to do what's right for your kids. If you didn't have kids, you would have more options. But you need to choose your kids because they don't have a way to get out of the situation unless you help them. Think about how scared you were, imagine how your son must feel.", "Because I\u2019m genuinely scared of this guy. I have no family here to help me.", "So his behavior is okay? Just because he doesn't want to go, that means he can yell and scream and take his (unnecessary) anger out on OP and the kids? Gtfo.", "If you feel like he is going to become violent with you, then he is. People like this don't just snap out of it and become kind and respectful. The dude needs serious professional help and you need to protect yourself and your children.", "Has he ever been violent with your 12 year old? You did say he takes his temper out on her...", "If you stay, I can guarantee you that he will", "Umm this is not reasonable. I had a shitty childhood and 20s (I hadn't yet gone NC). I do not treat my husband or his parents like that. In fact, I am grateful his parents have loved and accepted me. \n\nThis is some scary stuff. I wouldn't go anywhere with him and plan an exit. The scariest time for you is when you do leave, please be careful and take every precaution you can. Can your parents come visit you?", "Nope he's wrong and OP should leave. I said that.", "He thinks they\u2019re nosy and too invested in our marriage. That\u2019s always what he tells me.\n\nAlso, not necessarily to me but he did used to give me the silent treatment a lot when he wasn\u2019t happy.", "He just screams at her and calls her names when he\u2019s in a bad mood.", "I guess what I mean is that the reasoning makes sense.", "Every other comment of yours is you jumping through hoops trying to blame OP above the husband.", "you\u2019re actually the worst. really bending over backwards to find ways to blame this on the woman.", "Wow, you REALLY don't know how abusive situations can be, do you?", "So basically they either already do notice or might notice that he treats you and your kids like shit, and would care enough to put a stop to it.", "One of the first thing abusive partners do is isolate you from your support system. Friends and family become 'nosy and a bad influence ' your husband cant exert his control over you if you have people around you that will tell you that you are being mistreated", "im sorry but you need to get out of this marriage i saw your edit and what he is doing is not right go to greece if you can with your kids", "He's saying this, in an attempt to gaslight you so he can isolate is you. That what abusers do. Also read my comment in the main thread. Let me know if you can't find it, and I'll copy and paste it here", "Oh yea I was bored. Started raining work got slow but just about 10 more minutes left for this bs.", "Is that a community line and you're calling me Brita? \n\nAlso, this is reddit. I'm sorry I don't take this serious", "I do.....that's why I said I hope she gets out of there. Wow do you disagree with me and think she should stay?\n\nEdit: smh comment and than block me"]}
