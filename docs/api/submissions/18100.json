I (42F) have 2 kids (3M and 12F) with my husband (45M). Every summer, we go somewhere nice. Our last two trips were to Disneyland. It was alright. The kids wanted to visit their grandparents in Greece as it\u2019s been years since we last went. I did too honestly. My husband? Nope. He wants to go to Disneyland a third time. It was alright the first time. Wouldn\u2019t do it again. The kids were exhausted too. \n\nThis has caused several arguments within the span of two days. I\u2019m talking serious meltdowns and nonstop swearing. Sometimes, I couldn\u2019t believe we were ONLY arguing about Disneyland. \n\nMy husband tells me I\u2019m too \u201cbossy\u201d and that he doesn\u2019t want to see my parents again (he doesn\u2019t like them because he thinks they\u2019re too nosy). We\u2019ve had this argument so many times to the point where I just sit there and let him scream at me while I go on my phone. \n\nToday, I was on the phone with my mom. I was explaining to her that my husband wanted to go to Disneyland AGAIN but the rest of us wanted to see them. She told me to sit down and have a conversation with him so we could come up with something we both want to do. The problem is he refuses to talk to me anymore as \u201cwe\u2019ve already established the fact that we are going to Disneyland, no questions asked.\u201d \n\nHe overheard our conversation and he took the phone from my hand and hung up the phone. Cue a massive screaming match. He told me he\u2019s tired of me and \u201cwhat\u2019s another year of making memories at Disney?\u201d He literally wouldn\u2019t let me get a word in. I was scared in all honesty. I completely shut down when he told me he deserved to make memories with better people. I told him to stop or we were gonna have issues. He dropped my phone on the floor and stormed off. I immediately tended to my 3 year old as he was crying profusely.\n\nReddit, I was in tears. I still am. I feel like our marriage is falling apart over Disneyland. I feel like I should just suck it up like I did last year and go along with it for the sake of our relationship and the kids feelings (they were scared from all the fighting). I don\u2019t know what to do. Tell him I\u2019ll go one more time or avoid him altogether.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: he was not always like this to me although he does have a temper and he takes it out on my 12 year old sometimes. I\u2019m only putting up with this because I feel like if I try to divorce him, shit will really hit the fan and he\u2019ll do something crazy.", "created_utc": 1684968395, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13r0f4j/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_needs_to_stop/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, hanging up a phone call on your behalf is messed up. Sounds like a large toddler", "OP this borders on abuse, both physical and emotional.  For him to make these demands and grab the phone physically from you, you definitely need to not only contact attorney as suggested but also research all of the family finances covertly without his knowledge.  This marriage has become a dictatorship and no way to live, and giving in is only going to feed into his ego and make your life as well as the lives of your children more miserable.", "NTA\n\nWhy does he only want to go to Disney? If he loves it so much he can go with other people while you and the kids holiday somewhere else. This would be bizarre, controlling behaviour even without factoring in that you want to see your family. He has essentially told you that you are never going to visit your family. If I were you I\u2019d be having a good think to see if this behaviour is out of character or if he\u2019s like this more than you realise.

This will also most likely lead to your husband complaining about how no one is happy. No one will be happy at Disney. \n\nHe doesn't like your parents? Big deal. I find it tends to be rare that other people like their in-laws. He should be able to suffer while you and your kids have fin in Greece with your family like you did last year at Disney.\n\nThe phone destruction is a bit of a red flag.

No one established you are going to Disneyland what he is doing is controlling and emotionally abusive.", "NTA\n\nAs a husband, I'm concerned for your safety.

Physical violence has no place in a healthy marriage.\n\nJust a suggestion from experience, put together an escape bag and keep it somewhere away from the home.\n\nMadam, his behavior is concerning.

And no, you don't force three people (including both children!) to go to Disneyland when they don't want to.\n\nAt this point I'd say take your kids and go to Greece. Get away now. Give him the time to sort himself out (ideally with a therapist) and decide if he wants to be there when you get home.\n\nThis trip is only a symptom of a much bigger problem. He wants to be the king of the household, and respects no other opinions. You're not being \"bossy,\" you are trying to stand up for an equal voice in the family decisions and trying to protect your children from someone who disregards their feelings.\n\nI'm also guessing that your parents don't encourage you to bend to his will like he wants, so that's why he thinks they're too \"nosy.\"\n\nEDIT: make sure your finances are protected too - he doesn't sound safe to leave home alone and angry.", "NTA.

Not being able to go to Disney for the third year in a row and unilaterally making that decision every year and denying your wife and child her family because you don\u2019t like them is abusive.", "OP is also not yelling at her partner endlessly", "I think I disagree. They have been to Disney twice even when they didn't want to. Op hasn't seen her family for a while. Her husband should suck it up and let her visit her family.\n\nI wouldn't back down either if my husband wouldn't let me see my family.", "> She told me to sit down and have a conversation with him so we could come up with something we both want to do.\n\n> The problem is he refuses to talk to me anymore as \u201cwe\u2019ve already established the fact that we are going to Disneyland, no questions asked.\u201d\n\nOP is not acting like they have to go to Greece.  She is willing to compromise and he isn\u2019t.  Beyond not being willing to compromise, his stance is horribly controlling.\n\nIn any case, the question of Disneyland vs not Disneyland isn\u2019t the most important part of this post.\n\n> He overheard our conversation and he took the phone from my hand and hung up the phone.\n\nUnacceptable.\n\n> Cue a massive screaming match. He told me he\u2019s tired of me and \u201cwhat\u2019s another year of making memories at Disney?\u201d He literally wouldn\u2019t let me get a word in.  I was scared in all honesty.\n\nUnacceptable.\n\n> I completely shut down when he told me he deserved to make memories with better people.\n\nUnacceptable.\n\n> he was not always like this to me although he does have a temper and he takes it out on my 12 year old sometimes.\n\nIf this is what she means by his temper and he takes it out on their child then he\u2019s abusing his children as well and OP shouldn\u2019t have accepted that either.\n\n> I\u2019m only putting up with this because I feel like if I try to divorce him, shit will really hit the fan and he\u2019ll do something crazy.\n\nYeah, he\u2019s abusive.\n\nSo no they\u2019re not doing the same thing.  OP needs to protect herself and her children.", ">The last time we went to Greece, he acted like a baby. For the sake of the trip and everyone else, I didn\u2019t start with him.\n\nwhat did he do?", "yeah expand on that better people part as well", "Focus your energy on making a plan to leave him. Look at the profile u/ebbie45 for resources. He is already escalating his abuse to your children. It\u2019s time to get them out.", "to be honest, i feel like the best thing for your kids would be to get them away from him. i don\u2019t want to scare you but to me he does seem a bit dangerous. i\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this. sending well wishes and hope for your safety and happiness <3", "I see on here all the time wives refusing to be around their in laws.  Most people say it's their right. Why can't OP husband say the same. \n\nI'm not saying go to Disney. I'm not saying go to Greece. \n\nI say go to neither and go somewhere everyone enjoy and on a later trip OP and the kids see her family. \n\nTruthfully isn't this the best solution where they get they're family vacation. They don't go to Disney and OP and the kids see her parents. \n\nThats what I'm saying compromise not argue back and forth", "I\u2019ll expand on the abusive part before you think I\u2019m overreacting. Abusers will often isolate their victims away from their family. They cut them off so that their victims are completely dependent upon them financially, emotionally, and otherwise. This isolation coupled with the screaming he did at her just screams emotional abuse to me.", "I see here all the time of wives saying they don't like their husband families and cut them off. The husband still sees his family and wife stay home. \n\nWhy can't OP just do that instead of insisting he come along?", "How do you know?  She said it been nonstop arguing and swearing.  She never said it was one-sided.  Ill guess they're both doing it", "He kept complaining about how he should\u2019ve stayed back. Just being a little kid. My parents were taken aback at times by his behaviour but we still managed to enjoy our time.", "Sorry. I\u2019m pretty shaken right now so I might\u2019ve missed some things.\n\nHe tends to flirt a lot with other women in front of me. He tells me he\u2019s just being friendly and they\u2019re reciprocating that but I let it go because every single time I bring it up, he explodes on me. The problem with me is that I struggle to stand up for myself at times because I do fear him sometimes. It\u2019s his bad temper. He hasn\u2019t had the best childhood and he resents his parents for that so I guess instead of moving on, he brings it into our marriage.", "If the in laws have done something heinous to deserve being cut off, sure, a spouse can decline to spend time with them. There\u2019s zero evidence that\u2019s the case.", "I don\u2019t see where she insisted he come along. I see where she said three of the four family members want to visit her parents in Greece. I think sending them would be a wonderful compromise. I\u2019d be interested to see if that was mentioned in the past and what was said (certainly wasn\u2019t in this conversation since OP says she didn\u2019t a word in). \n\nAnd I implore you to look at OP\u2019s edit. She very likely is afraid to bring it up.", "\u2018We\u2019ve had this argument so many times to the point where I just sat there and let him scream at me while I go on my phone\u2019", "your husband does not respect you or your family \n\nwhat person complains about going to greece? \n\ncan you give specifics really want to know how childish this was", "When was the last time you saw your parents?\n\nAnd what do you mean 'do something crazy'", "Do you think he resents your relationship with your parents and is trying to isolate you from them?", "Semi disagree.  You don't have to do something heinous for you not to like someone. If it's heinous than I say he has the right to say the kids can't even see them. \n\nBut if he's just saying we don't get a long so I don't want to see them. That's a good enough reason as long as he's not saying she's not allowed to see them.", "That kinda made me dislike OP just as much of the husband after reading the edit. \n\nThis man gets angry at her and abuses her 12 year old and not doing anything is upsetting. Especially because this post is about Disneyland.", "Sorry, I missed this. He was complaining the entire time, making passive aggressive comments about my parents, constantly pulling me aside to tell me he \u2018hates this shit\u2019. Only time I really enjoyed myself was when we weren\u2019t doing things with him (because he hates everything we do, I guess).", "3-4 years ago. I feel like he\u2019s gonna become violent with me.", "I have no idea but that sounds reasonable.", "You are really twisting yourself into knots trying to blame this woman for her own abuse.", "what did you parents do that he thinks they are bad people?\n\nwas he always like this \n\nsorry for all the questions", "OP, if you feel like your husband is going to be violent, you need help. Call friends, contact a local women\u2019s shelter and see if they have resources. You and your kids deserve better than being screamed at about not wanting to go to Disneyland.", "No im saying any parent shouldn't sit back and watch their child get abused. \n\nI'll ask you do you agree with that. That when her husband got mad at her, he took it out on their 12 year old.  \n\nI hope she reads this and get out of there and stops worrying about Disney vs Greece. This is the least of her problems\n\nNot blaming her but if she's doing nothing to protect her children, then she's part of the problem"]}
