I also watch her a lot when my mom IS home. I just turned 18 a few months ago too.\n\n   Ever since around age 9-10 my mom had 3 children whom Ive helped take care of a lot. My father, who doesn't live with us as of around august of 2022, is a big time user of many substances. So he would tell me to watch one of my siblings while he went outside to \"smoke\". This sessions would last anywhere around 10mins to 2 or 3 hours. MULTIPLE times a day. My mom also smokes cigs so she would go outside many times a day only for around 5-15 mins. So all those times I took care of my baby sibling. I also watched over them while my mom or dad went somewhere etc etc. I do have a younger brother whos helped a *few* times. So I've been essentially a huge part in rasing them.\n\n\nWe are now here, and those 3 siblings are now 8F,6M,2F. I also watch them on the weekend as well but my 8 year old sister can watch her self most times. My 6 year old brother is autistic and is super hard to watch over. He has been \"grounded\" and I have to make sure he stays in his room and watch my 2 year old sister while he is home from school on the weekends. It is very exhausting to say the least. I only get a break whenever my mom is off, even though she is off work I still watch my sister in the early morning while she takes my siblings to school and goes to ruin errands. She also goes out with different men at night (I think its 3 different ones). It's not every night but it's annoying. I am tired of my  whole life being watching kids that aren't my own. I have no social life and had to quit my job. \n\nThere have been many times shes asked to watch my sister on a separate occasion of me watching her while she is at work. I have declined a few times because at this point I am behind in school work and having time stay up until 5am JUST to catch up a little bit. I also get emotional a lot knowing that the senior year I dreamed of is spent online. And I haven't gone to any kind of school activities at all. When she asks me to watch my siter and I say no she always acts like i'm the worst person in the world and storms away and acts like  i'm super ungrateful. It hurts me everytime I decline because or her reaction. My description honestly doesn't do it justice. I feel like I am in the wrong everytime I decline.

You\u2019re only questioning your decisions because she\u2019s ingrained the belief in you so hard that this is your job or responsibility, IT IS NOT. You also need to come to terms with the fact that she will never be happy with you or proud unless you\u2019re carrying her responsibility 24/7 until the end of time so she can do what she wants. You need to learn to be okay with her seeing you as the bad guy. You\u2019re not actually the bad guy but that\u2019s how she\u2019ll see it because she\u2019s selfish and entitled. Start saying no more, if she makes a scene tell her to take what you\u2019re willing to give or leave it & she can figure out childcare for the kids full time by herself. Legally she can\u2019t force you to watch the kids and she\u2019s also not allowed to kick you out since you\u2019re still in school. Most states say you\u2019re under your parents care until you\u2019re either 18 or graduate high school, you haven\u2019t graduated so she can\u2019t throw you out. It\u2019s time to put you first, refusing to raise your siblings isn\u2019t selfish. It\u2019s selfish of her to demand then throw fits and name call when you say no (as you should). \n\nThat you\u2019re homeschooled specifically so you can help with the kids just screams how abusive this situation actually is. Frankly if I were you I\u2019d consider seeing if your online school (or if it\u2019s a real school that\u2019s just letting you do work online) see if there\u2019s a councilor or teacher you can contact to tell them everything. Teachers are mandated reporters, you could also contact CPS yourself. For the record CPS won\u2019t displace you unless that\u2019s what you want/ask for. They will however monitor your mom/the situation to make sure you\u2019re not the one raising your siblings and that your school work isn\u2019t being affected. If this was only the occasional helping out after school (in person school) or on the weekends that\u2019d be different; but your mom has effectively made you a second parent so she can do what the fuck she wants at the expense of your education and childhood.", "NTA.  You are being massively taken advantage of here.  Is there any way for you to get back into school for the rest of your senior year?\n\nIf not, please plan to get out as soon as you can.
