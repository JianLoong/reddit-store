It was relatively sudden and we're all still very shocked from it. As the eldest niece (she didnt have kids), I've been put in charge of planning and managing the funeral. My younger two siblings are helping me plan out the logistics, but they don't have the financial means to help contribute to the costs of it. She never had life insurance so that wasnt an option.\n\nMy husband and I aren't exactly rolling in dough either, but we do have a college savings account that we set up for our daughter (17F) who just finished her junior year of high school. She's planning on attending an in-state school, so tuition isn't a major issue. On top of that, some choice stocks brought exponential growth to our initial investment. Right now, the account is sitting at around \\~$80,000.\n\nI talked it out with my husband and we decided the best course for our family's financial stability is to take out around $20,000 for the burial, ceremonial, and travel costs from my daughter's college fund. We did the math and the $60,000 would be more than enough to pay for tuition and at least some of her housing throughout her time in college. We went ahead and transferred the money from the fund to the bank account and began making necessary preparations.\n\nWe told our daughter about this and she was *furious*. She said that we don't have the right to decide what to do with \"her money\" (which it isn't). Nonetheless, I'm less concerned about the technicalities of the situation and more concerned about whether or not it was the wrong move to pay for the funeral in this way.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684719921, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ocv6j/aita_for_using_my_daughters_college_fund_to_pay/", "score": 606, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's the dumbest reason ever. What about the eldest nephew? Or her siblings? Or everyone pitching in a portion?\n\nAlso, $20,000? She didn't save for her own funeral. She gets the cheapest funeral possible. 76 is plenty old to have planned for this.", "INFO: Is there a reason you needed to do $20.000 in funeral preparations? Cremation, a simple memorial, low cost travel etc would not come to that amount of money. There is absolutely no need for a large, expensive funeral.\n\nAlso was this a dedicated college savings account? If so, penalties will come out, lowering the fund because it was not used for educational purposes.", "Nooooooo! What were you thinking?? Why would you raid a college fund to pay $20k for a funeral? You can do a cremation for $600-900 and a service at church or park for under $300. Someone who didn't take out life insurance can hardly complain about not getting a fancy casket. YTA", "YTA \n\nYou didn't \"have the financial means\". That money was already earmarked for something else. It was promised to her. If you had just told her that she's getting $50k or whatever for college, and had your own savings, fine. But you are telling her it was from the account. \n\n\nI'm genuinely sorry for your loss, and it's ridiculous how much funeral/associated costs are. But you're taking that money away from the living.", "YTA.\n\n>but they don't have the financial means to help contribute to the costs of it\n\nNeither did you. You dipped into your daughters funds to contribute.\n\n>we do have a college savings account that we set up for our daughter (17F)\n\nSHE has a college savings account. It would be different if she was like, 10 and you had lots of time to put into it, but she is on the cusp, literally just a few months away from using this money.\n\nUnless you're planning on reimbursing her, major AH move, and even if you are planning on reimbursing, you really should have discussed it with her first. It's money you set aside for her, that she was counting on and about to use.", "YTA. It\u2019s kind of crazy how you thought that was ok. \n\nThat money was for her future and you took it for someone that honestly is strange for you to take care of their funeral anyway.", "If you can't afford a burial, instead of dipping into a college fund, go with cremation or something similar.\n\nYTA", "So, not really a college fund for your daughter then - when you say \"'her money' (which it isn't)\" you are saying this is not and was never set aside for her, just a piggy bank for you, and when you told her you that was her college fund previously, you were lying to her.  You should really think about that - I think you'll find your daughter remembers this for the rest of her life and recognizes that you are not trustworthy.  \n\nThere is no way you need to spend $20,000 on a funeral for someone you're not responsible for more than your daughter needs that money for college - she's going to end up taking out loans and every month when she pays, she'll remember you took the money out of her college fund because you didn't want to use your other assets.  YTA.\n\nAnd P.S.--> I hope that money wasn't in a tax advantaged instrument for college, because if it was, using it for yourself for other expenses might subject you to unfavorable tax consequences, though if so I suspect you'll just take that out of the not-really-for-college fund too...", "INFO: I feel like three key details are a bit vague.\n\n(1) Walk me through the exact math you did you arrive at $60K covering all tuition and some housing. How much housing? Did you include the cost of books, parking, travel, and misc technology fees that a lot of universities tack on?\n\n(2) Did your daughter know about this college fund beforehand and how much detail did she have? It's one thing to say it's not technically hers yet, but that's not what this sub is about.\n\n(3) Are there literally any other options? Does your aunt have any estate whatsoever to help pay for this, do you have a retirement account to borrow against, if your aunt didn't plan for the expenses of a funeral, is there a cheaper option you could go with, etc?", "Though I hate to say it, YTA.\n\nYou decided your daughter's financial future was less important than laying your aunt to rest with what I imagine are lots of bells and whistles, given the price tag.\n\n***And*** you did this after your daughter finished her junior year... meaning, your daughter is literally JUST GETTING READY to fill out college applications. She's probably already looked at options, discussed things with the guidance counselor, talked to teachers about writing recommendations, etc. And then you cut her college fund by 25% -- literally a quarter of the money -- and are **surprised** she's furious? She may have already missed deadlines for some scholarship options she didn't think she'd qualify for because of the money and/or she didn't think she'd need.\n\nYou said the aunt had no life insurance policy. OK. What about the rest of her estate? I get that the estate can take a lot of time to settle, so if your plan is to settle the estate and use whatever balance is left over to replenish the college fund, that would make sense. But you didn't mention that at all. You only mentioned taking 1/4 of the college fund and spending it on a funeral.", "YTA.\n\nI just buried my mother and my father in law in the most expensive part of the country.  Combined they cost $20k.\n\nThe hard truth is you will never see your aunt again, but you are stuck with your daughter for life.\n\nGet reimbursed from whatever is left in the estate, put that money back, as much as you can.  Funeral expenses get paid like any other debt before distribution of assets.", "YTA. That money was for your daughter\u2019s education and you\u2019re not anticipating replenishing the withdrawal. On top of that, you and your husband made the decision without including your daughter in the conversation. I don\u2019t blame her for being furious.", "Absolutely YTA. $80k isn\u2019t even remotely enough to cover four years of a non-community college or a university, if paying for it all outright without loans is your goal, and here you are knocking it down to $60k. If I were your daughter, I\u2019d be going What the hell? at the top of my lungs. Nice that you have that kind of family feeling, but you really can\u2019t afford this funeral if you have to crack into an untouchable fund. Plan it as if you don\u2019t have another resource, get some kind of contribution from other family members, and put the money back.", "What the hell kind of funeral costs $20k?\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou could have done something small or a cremation for under 3k\n\nYou took *twenty thousand*\n\nHow much of that is actually going to the funeral????", "YTA. Simple cremation and spread the ashes. Or open an older relative's grave and add the urn to the vault. So much cheaper the dead don't care.", "YTA, for sure.  Why do you HAVE to pay $20k for the funeral?  Why can't you ask your siblings to also help?  Why can't you find a cheaper option?  How is her funeral worth a quarter of the money you'd saved for your daughter's college?", "YTA-that\u2019s not enough money for 4 years! Her books and supplies is 10k. You now only have maybe two years of college money. What the hell did you do? If I was you daughter I would be having a massive meltdown. You could have done direct creation and a short service for about $5k. \n\nInfo: Are you prepared to take out 20k in loans to make this right or are you punishing her with 20k in loans on top of what her out of pocket would be after her college fund?", "YTA. While it is your money to do with as you please, you took 25% of the money intended for your daughters education without even asking. My moms funeral in 2015 was 4K with cremation. I know inflation is insane, but 20k for a funeral? That\u2019s ridiculous and should be reduced by half atleast. \n\nYour daughter will remember this event and never let you forget it either. That\u2019s what the 20k bought you, a permanent reminder of your choice for the past rather than the future.", "Who's funeral costs $20,000.   That's absolutely ridiculous!!", "Oh my gosh! Noooo! Invest in your living daughter, not your dead aunt. Seriously, use the money to do good, not out of mere duty. Im not going 59 day you\u2019re the asshole, but this would be a really world choice on several levels. I\u2019m really curious, why did you tell your daughter where the funeral money was coming to? Had you already told her how much was in her account?  Was her name on the account at all?  Had you already told her the money in the account was hers? You say it wasn\u2019t her money and she thinks it was. Where\u2019s the discrepancy coming from?", "I don\u2019t like saying this but I feel YTA. As a current colleges student, who\u2019s mother passed away recently I\u2019m weirdly experienced in both of these situations.\n\n1. As others have pointed out $20,000 is a lot, I would cut it down to about $10,000 if possible by cremating or something. Honestly, though I would avoid touching it at all. If needed maybe even set up a GoGundMe and have family members/ friends promote it to locals and in social media. That\u2019s what mine did and it raised more than enough for everything.\n\n2. $60,000 may sound like enough for now, but you truly don\u2019t know that. Colleges have a bad habit of randomly raising tuition and adding in dumb fees (mine definitely did).\n\nYour daughter also needs to worry about textbooks and other supplies/ emergency expenses such as car troubles. Nearly every friend of mine who has a car has needed some sort of emergency repair while at school. \n\nMost importantly, you may seriously damage the relationship with your daughter by doing this. Especially if it ends up not being enough to cover college expenses. I would have a hard time trusting my parents if they pulled this stunt on me. Especially since you wouldn\u2019t have much time to try and save more money before she goes off to school.", "YTA what would you have done if you didn\u2019t have the college fund to raid? The deceased should have had burial insurance. Otherwise you get cremated and no public funeral. Your daughters future is what matters, not having a fancy funeral.", "YTA - There will always be unexpected expenses associated with college, that is just a fact.  Also depending upon what type of account you put the money in you might actually have tax implications and/or you might not be legally able to do what you are planning to do.  Also, no one needs a 20k funeral, cheap box, cremation, biscuit tin for the ashes we are all good to go.", "YTA. Why would you pay 20K for a DEAD PERSON\u2019S FUNERAL At the expense of your LIVING CHILD??? Cremate the woman and toss her ashes in the wind and have a potluck wtf", "**YTA**\n\n>She never had life insurance so that wasnt an option.\n\nDid she have a pension from her employment?   Generally they have a burial benefit of $5K or so and TBH, You should be able do have a nice service for $10.", "YTA. $20,000?! For a funeral?! That is the most ludicrous, awful, unnecessary thing I have ever heard. Why? Just why?\nThere is literally no need.", "YTA that money was saved for your child\u2019s education and you want to spend a significant amount of it on a funeral! I\u2019m 76 and have made it clear to my children that I\u2019m to have the cheapest funeral available. Cremation and ashes in a cardboard box to be scattered. They can hold a Wake if they wish for family but not at a funeral home. Much the same as I did for my husband, which cost $4,000. Funerals and weddings have become an industry that is out of control.", "YTA...wtf? 20,000 for a funeral? That's crazy. And you are stealing from your daughter. You saved that money FOR HER...and now you, on a technicality, are saying it's not really hers. It 1000% is. Dead people don't need 20,000.00 funerals. Ridiculous.", "You robbed your daughters\u2019 future to throw a party for a dead person?\n\nYTA", "YTA pull the money from your own retirement account. If you want to screw someone to pay for a funeral, screw yourself and not your kid.", "YTA.\nYour aunt\u2019s poor life planning shouldn\u2019t be the problem of your daughter to solve.", "Eh I would say that YTA for not discussing it with your daughter since it sounds like she was aware of the balance of her college fund and everything. You made a decision to get rid of a quarter of her college fund and as a junior it\u2019s not like she actually settled on the school she will attend. Y\u2019all might have unintentionally limited her options by doing this based on what she thinks she\u2019ll do now(which definitely changes when you\u2019re actually a senior). Why aren\u2019t the siblings of your aunt handling any of the financial burden? I\u2019m not sure why you didn\u2019t give your daughter a heads up. Technically it\u2019s not her money, but it\u2019s money she is expecting and has a vested interest in so ultimately it\u2019s understandable why she\u2019s upset.", "YTA \n \nCan\u2019t say what I\u2019d like because I don\u2019t want to get banned, but a child\u2019s future should come before commemorating the end of an elder\u2019s life. How do you think your aunt would feel about your decision? \n\nIf that amount of money *must* be spent, then get the family together to cover the costs, or hold off on more than a simple cremation until it\u2019s financially feasible to do so.", "20k our of your daughters collage fund to have an unnecessary funeral?! YTA", "YTA for spending 20k on a dead person. They\u2019re dead! You are penalizing a living child for a dead person who will have no idea. We did cremation for 3k. What a waste of money!", "YTA. Did you really need to fork out $20,000 to say goodbye to someone. Because that\u2019s what it is. A funeral is for the living, not for the dead. If you couldn\u2019t afford it you should\u2019ve thought about other, cheaper options. $20,000 is A LOT of money. You just said to her \u201cus saying goodbye to this person in this particular way, is more important than your future financial situation\u201d. Of course she\u2019s upset.", "YTA. There are ways to cut costs with a burial. If you can't afford it, you find alternatives. You have no idea what the value of that account will be when she's in college. What if it's only worth $40K? Or less?\n\nMost designated college funds require the money be spent on legitimate educational expenses.", "YTA. Seems like you're stealing your kid's future so you can get clout with your family.", "Why on earth would you blow that much money on a dead person and take away from your very alive daughters future? My best friend died with no money and no Insurance so we had her cremated for $650. It's absolutely not your responsibility to provide your aunt with a fancy funeral and to pay for people's travel expenses. This is absolutely crazy. Your daughter will never forget this and she shouldn't. YTA.", "Of course YTA. You are raiding your daughter\u2019s future to pay $20,000 for her great aunt\u2019s funeral.  Have a much, much less elaborate funeral and find some other way to pay for it.", "You took from your daughter who has her life in front her to pay an insane amount kn a funeral?? Yeah, YTA.", "YTA.\n\n76 is sudden? Are you a family of tortoises or gators or something?

My father could easily have afforded more than $20,000 but at his request he was cremated at a total cost of less than $500 including the 20 death certificates which I learned from past experience were good to have on hand. My parents are scattered together in a bird sanctuary they loved - no cost.", "Sorry for the loss of a family member. I'm super sympathetic.\n\nBut in saying that, as stated in other comments. None of you had the \"Financial Means\" to achieve this.\n\nNo, it's not your daughters money, but clearly it had a purpose.\nIf your daughter stated she was upset bc of college - that should have been the indication of \"Maybe I shouldn't do that\"... and still ask the AITA question.\n\nYes. \nYes, you are.\n\nIf you're chipping the entire $20K to cover it, although sweet in concept, has now upset the relationship between your daughter and yourselves.", "YTA for choosing a harder future for your daughter during her college years. Student loans are crushing our young people because they are expensive and carry high interest rates. Most part-time jobs won't pay enough to pay her living costs, books, and tuition that you will no longer be paying for. You've opted to make her life miserable to pay an outrageous amount of money for your Aunt's funeral.\n\nYou're under no obligation to dispose of your aunt's remains. Also, it shouldn't cost 20k for a simple cremation (it recently cost us 3k) and interment! You're being gouged by the funeral home.", "INFO - Was your daughter aware of the amount in the fund?  If so, did you give her the impression that she could count on that amount in order to make her school plans?\n\nWas it an option to use your retirement fund instead of the college fund?\n\nDo you intend on putting anything back into the college fund before your daughter graduates?", "YTA. You're torching your daughter's future that you have explicitly promised her for what I'm guessing is her entire life for a funeral. \n\nMy sister graduated last year. Because of her grades, we were lucky enough to get her tuition locked in after her first year. Even with that locked in rate, the price that she needed to pay increased significantly each year due to textbooks increasing in price and fees that she wasn't warned about popping up. And that's not even looking into housing or transportation, because she was lucky enough to live with family friends. \n\nYou don't know what goes into college, you stole from your daughter--because yes, it was her money, it was for her college, if there was money left over after college then *maybe* you would be within your rights to use it--and you're the asshole here.", "YTA, that money was put away with the intention of your child\u2019s education, by taking that money out you are limiting her. Your aunt didn\u2019t plan for her death at 74 then she should have the funeral she can afford. Would she want to take away opportunities for her niece? The adults in the family should figure out the money situation and not use the college funds. 20k seems excessive and could be cut down.", "YTA. She feels betrayed regardless of technicalities on who had rights to the funds. She was depending on these funds for her future plans. Not sure you can justify hurting your child\u2019s future (this is how she feels regardless of your \u201ccalculations\u201d and you should be careful not to dismiss her feelings\u2026 again) in order to give your aunt an elaborate ending that apparently nobody could afford. \n\nWhat you should be concerned about right now is making amends with your daughter. She\u2019s just about at the age where this sort of betrayal may cause her to distance herself from you for a long while. If you don\u2019t want that, I suggest you give her a sincere, humble apology, as well as acknowledgement of her hurt feelings and feelings of betrayal, regardless of whether or not you can repay the funds. \n\nYou may have felt obligated as the oldest to do this and clearly have calculated all sorts of ways to justify your decision, but your own daughter got shoved down the \u201cpriority hierarchy\u201d quite rudely and dismissively. She is alive and well and she is your child. She should have received more consideration and priority than extended relatives. Her trust in you has been broken. It may take a long while to recover from this and it\u2019s a bigger deal than you want to acknowledge.", "YTA, WTF $20K for a funeral?  It can be way cheaper for a burial than that.  And cremation is even cheaper.  I did my pre planned cremation for $3.5, that includes the onsite chapel for the funeral and a luncheon.", "I am so sorry for your loss, and for having to make tough decisions in an emotional mind state.  That being said YTA.  You took away from your daughter's future.   I understand you used quotes for \"her money\" - I guess to make sure readers and your daughter are aware she didn't contribute to this fund.  So if you take that stance, sure parents can do whatever they want with \"their money\"   Morally, yes it was the wrong move, to take away from a child's future for a ceremony for the deceased.   I lost two siblings in the past 3 years, both with no life insurance and both ceremonies/preparations put together didn't add up to $20,000 ( I am in the NY area so not a cheap market either).

But you borrowed against your daughter\u2019s future here, and you did so without much thought it sounds like.   What if a better school that cost more money wants her?   Guess she\u2019s priced out of that opportunity now.", "YTA - You can have a much more economical funeral!  Your daughter has every right to be furious.", "Oof this is really tough and I am so sorry for your loss but.. YTA\n\nCollege funds shouldn't be touched until the person either decides not to go to college, or I'd say it's fair to pull it if they aren't passing their classes. Not sure what your daughter wants to study but there are some fields of study where the local state schools just don't have the best programs, or a program at all. In my field of study the top schools we recruit entry level folks from are all private schools. However I know locally the big hospitals recruit nurses from the local state school because their program is _better_ than the private schools.\n\nThen of course say she did go to a state school, that 20k could have helped her out with a masters degree!\n\nShe's still very young and you did just take away some choices for her. You're correct it's technically your money- but you set it aside _for her_. It sounds like she knew how much was in it and you don't always know what goes on in a teenagers mind. Maybe she had a school on her list that won't be an option now.\n\nIt's still a privilege to go to college. Your average millennial and Gen zer will tell you it is a shit world right now. Both generations are saddled with college debt, we have a housing crisis, and the housing market is INSANE. Any leg up you can give your child in this world is becoming necessary. 80k seems like a lot (and it is) but it went a hell of a lot further 10 years ago than it does now. \n\nGood luck OP.", "Cremation. It's so much less expensive and a totally reasonable choice. There is no need to spend this kind of money. I have paid for several funerals and none of them were anywhere close to that cost. YTA if you spend your kids' education when the rest of the family contributes nothing.", "YTA. Not because of the legalities of whose money it is (clearly yours and not your daughters- unless put in a 529 account in which case you have a big fine coming\u2026). But mostly the idea of claiming to put money away for a kid and then deciding to spend it frivolously on something else is just an asshole thing to do.

It was relatively sudden and we're all still very shocked from it. As the eldest niece (she didnt have kids), I've been put in charge of planning and managing the funeral. My younger two siblings are helping me plan out the logistics, but they don't have the financial means to help contribute to the costs of it. She never had life insurance so that wasnt an option.\n\nMy husband and I aren't exactly rolling in dough either, but we do have a college savings account that we set up for our daughter (17F) who just finished her junior year of high school. She's planning on attending an in-state school, so tuition isn't a major issue. On top of that, some choice stocks brought exponential growth to our initial investment. Right now, the account is sitting at around \\~$80,000.\n\nI talked it out with my husband and we decided the best course for our family's financial stability is to take out around $20,000 for the burial, ceremonial, and travel costs from my daughter's college fund. We did the math and the $60,000 would be more than enough to pay for tuition and at least some of her housing throughout her time in college. We went ahead and transferred the money from the fund to the bank account and began making necessary preparations.\n\nWe told our daughter about this and she was *furious*. She said that we don't have the right to decide what to do with \"her money\" (which it isn't). Nonetheless, I'm less concerned about the technicalities of the situation and more concerned about whether or not it was the wrong move to pay for the funeral in this way.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's amazing you and your husband are willing to destroy your relationship with your daughter over this. You will reap what you sow.\n\nAdditionally, why the hell do you need $20,000 for a funeral? Your Aunt should've had a life insurance or burial insurance policy to cover this issue. Is she being buried overseas in The Maldives? Funerals do not have to be extravagant affairs.

Unless you have to fly overseas, you all can drive cross country.\n\nI would imagine your daughter is more upset and furious over you withdrawing the money from her college fund without consulting her over the issue more than the fact that you took it out for the funeral. You set that fund up for her and I'm sure she knew just how much was in there.\n\nTaking $20,000 out without talking to her first is betrayal of trust.

You don't have to pay for college, but kneecapping the kids college fund a year before college makes you the asshole", "Except that they had previously told their daughter about it; that it was *her* \u201ccollege fund.\u201d Whadya\u2019 wanna\u2019 bet that the college fund has been brought up in more than a few conversations?", "So? This isn't legaladvice, it's AmItheAsshole, and OP is definitely the asshole", "Maybe you aren\u2019t sure what sub you\u2019re in. You\u2019re in the AITA sub. Whether it was their money or not OP is absolutely an asshole", "Right and that\u2019s why the OP is an asshole", "That would have to be something the OP would need to further explain.  They say it is their money in the post, how was this fund talked about previously with the kid."]}
