You included \u201che drinks a lot.\u201d If this behavior is a pattern, def concerning. But all in all, he\u2019s an inconsiderate A-hole. At his GROWN age.", "NTA. Maybe consider if you want to be tied to an alcoholic long term though.", "NTA. Is your boyfriend stuck in his college frat days? I understand wanting to chill out with buddies for a fun event, but getting hammered & then mocking you to look cool in front of his buddies is dumb. Also, the fact that you are expecting to hear a bunch of BS from him in the morning about you wanting to sleep in a room you paid for is a red flag.", "NTA- You wanted to go to bed, you're already in bed half naked and people walk in the room.. of course you're going to want them gone.
