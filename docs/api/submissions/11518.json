She was totally surprised and wasn't expecting me to propose for at least another 6 months since she finishes nursing school in about a year. We've been together for 8 months, but I wanted to get a jump start on wedding planning since she wants to get married as soon as she graduates.\n\nWhile we talked about rings and proposals in the past, she always said she wanted a REAL diamond. She has been adamant on a natural diamond...not lab made, and no other stones other than diamonds. She was never specific on the type of cut she wanted, carat, or anything else other than she just wanted \"natural\" diamonds. With all of that being said, she knows I'm in the process of starting a software company and that I should be able to find something for \"$1000 or less\" based on my budget.\n\nAt the time of our conversations, I thought nothing of it and figured that was accurate. When I started ring shopping, I wasn't even in the same universe with the budget I had. Even the online engagement rings that were supposedly \"more affordable\" were priced 3 times my expected budget.\n\nI ended up looking at \"fake\" diamond rings that look like the real deal. Based on my research, I found that a Sterling Silver band with Cubic Zirconia as the stone was not only similar to the real deal, but it was only $20 on Amazon! I figure I can get this ring and then when we're ready, I can just suggest that we upgrade the current ring she has. Maybe 5 or 10 years from now.\n\nWhen she saw the ring she LOVED it. She said it was exactly what she had dreamed of and started asking about how I found a \"natural\" diamond that was so flawless and clear. I don't even remember the BS answer I came up with, but she rebuttaled with \"where did you buy it?\"...\"how much did it cost?\"...\"does it have a lifetime warranty?\" I wasn't expecting this sort of interrogation and now I'm having to keep track of all the lies I've made since she has been talking about the ring ALL NIGHT. To make matters worse, both of our families were present for the proposal and engagement after-party. They were impressed by my budget ring as well.\n\nI think she'll calm down with the questions after a week or so, and I really feel like the decision I made was the best option for our future from a financial standpoint. If I tell her, I know she'll be upset, but I don't think I'll need to since she'll never take the ring to have the diamonds tested or anything like that. It's not like anyone else knew the difference either!\n\nAITA for thinking about this from a financial standpoint and setting up our future, or will this blow up in my face somehow with the lies I've been having to tell?", "created_utc": 1678006276, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11is8l4/aita_for_buying_my_fianc\u00e9_a_fake_diamond_for_her/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your logic for not getting a real diamond is sound but you're about to get married to this person... you should have brought up the topic and said 'hey - that's not likely when we first get engaged but we will definitely change it when we're in a more financially secure position if it's important to you' rather than just buying a lab diamond and hoping she wouldn't ask you about it. You're about to enter a life long relationship with this person - being able to talk about finances and priorities is key to a healthy relationship.", "You lied. \n\nAbout a (checks notes) $20 ring that you bought on Amazon. \n\nWhen your gf (stbx) expected something at least 100x thst. \n\n\nYou better figure something out, and fast. \n\nI almost don\u2019t want to tell you where your lies are going to bite you in the ass, but someone\u2019s going to point it out, so. \n\nThat $20 Amazon ring is going to turn her finger green in less than a month. Good luck. \n\nYTA  for being tragically r/confidentlywrong", "Welp.\n\nFirst of all, marrying someone you've only known for eight months is a very bad idea.\n\nFor instance, you've probably never seen her really mad.\n\nYou'll be able to experience that when she finds out you lied to her. You could have just been honest and said that what she wanted was way out of your budget. But you didn't. So here we are. \n\nA $20 ring is going to turn her finger green and you'll be in deep shit. Real rings come with certificates of authenticity. \n\nBest of luck.", "YTA\n\nIf you can't afford a nicer ring, then talk to her. Getting engaged after 8 months, while you're in the process of starting a business and she's still in school, is not the smartest move anyway.\n\nThere's a whole world of affordable options between a cheap fake $20 ring and a real diamond ring. And I don't believe for one second that **nobody** at the gathering noticed how cheap this is, especially since your gf had some ideas about styles and costs", "YTA for the $20 ring alone man. I\u2019m sorry, but think how cheap and unloved she is going to feel when she finds out you spent TWENTY dollars on a ring. TWO ZERO. I spend more than that on lunch. Jesus. \n\nShe\u2019s gonna find out and likely end the relationship. You need to tell her what you\u2019ve done or find a replacement ring, a REAL one, asap.\n\nYou can buy a diamond ring for $1000 or less.", "YTA not for buying something cheap but for lying about it. This is an engagement ring, so you are starting your life together with a lie?", "Well.. silver tarnishes so I think she\u2019s going to notice in a couple months that it\u2019s not white gold or platinum. \n\nI totally understand where you\u2019re coming from but a \u00a320 ring will be noticeably cheaper when it gets more used. Basically, she\u2019s going to know eventually. \n\nAre you sure you couldn\u2019t find *anything* in the \u00a3350-\u00a3500 range? That\u2019s still half your budget. I love jewellery and I see lots of beautiful rings in that price range that would make wonderful engagement rings. My own engagement ring was white gold, platinum plated which made it more affordable than a platinum ring. \n\nYTA for starting your marriage with a lie. Not the arsehole for trying to save money.", "YTA. You lied about the ring. Sure, her demand for a diamond was out of your budget, but lying wasn't the answer. And you know how she's going to be showing that ring off - of course someone eventually will say \"but that's not real\" and there goes your (potential) marriage. \n\nPull your foot out of your mouth now, though it may be too late already.", "YTA and it has nothing to do with the money. I actually agree that expensive rings are a waste of money. But it's like you're putting a lie in the foundation of your marriage. And it's not a little lie \u2014I think deceit about money and spending this early on says that you're going to have big big problems down the road.\n\nIf you both don't have similar values about money, spending, gifts, and honesty, and can't talk them out and reach a compromise... Why are you getting married?", "YTA\n\nHave fun when she finds out. Wish I could be there to see it. Cause that shit is gonna be FUH KNEE", "YTA, but not for the cheap ring. You are YTA for starting your engagement with a lie. She doesn't need to take it trsted, soon it will scratch up and she'll notice))) or the silver part will start to fade / go dark and she'll take it to get cleaned. It will come to light and that's gonna be the end of your engagement", "It's one thing to be honest and upfront about a fake diamond ring. You basically shot yourself in the foot by lying and the repeatedly doubling down. When she finds out, you may not have a way back. Bad move dude.\n\nYTA", "YTA for starting a future based on a lie. This is not going to go well for you when she inevitably finds out.", "YTA.\n\nFor one thing, if she didn't specify a size or carat it is pretty easy to fibd a nice ring at a jeweller for under $1k. Just searching one of my local stores I immediately found 4 nice white gold/diamond rings.\n\nIt sounds like you didn't do your research and/or walked in saying 'engagement ring' at which point the jewellers knew they could con you into something way too expensive. \n\nSecondly and most importantly, you lied to her. I have worn a lot of rings and the one you got is likely to tarnish real quick, you also can't trust the quality of the stone setting. $200 is more than enough for a decent ring but unless you are ordering from somewhere reputable $20 is not. This will break and she will find out .", "YTA. Way to start off this engagement. With lies. \n\nGood luck to you. Soon you\u2019ll be able to give that ring to someone else.", "YTA. You lied. That\u2019s literally all that matters. A relationship built on lies is doomed to fail.", "Well, the good news is you won't have to plan on spending money on a wedding. Once she finds out that what you said was white gold and diamond is actually silver and zircon (rest assured, the universe where she never finds out does not exist) she'll be out the door before the ring hits the floor.\n\nYTA, better luck with your next girlfriend.", "YTA. The budget ring isn\u2019t the issue but lying about it is. What kind of a foundation are you setting for your life together if you\u2019re unable to communicate these things with your partner. In a relationship there needs to be some level of mutual understanding which I\u2019m sure your partner would provide if you explained your reasoning.", "YTA \n\nWould be wise to go find a jeweller, and order a white gold ring with a real stone \u2026 like the one you pretended she\u2019s been given \n\nMoney isn\u2019t everything. Starting your marriage with a huge lie, is.", "YTA, if you had bought at least a gold ring priced a bit more I would understand and say NTA but the fact it cost $20 is not acceptable for a proposal especially when you knew and had agreed to the expectations then lied another what the ring was.\nWhen I married my husband he didn\u2019t earn a lot and got me a $700 ring which was not diamond which I love, however wasn\u2019t my dream ring. 3 years later and he has bought me a 1ct lab diamond which is what we can afford now and has always said he will buy me more when he can which I don\u2019t expect but appreciate. He has always been upfront which you have not been maybe she would of understood if you told her the truth or let her pick something", "YTA for lies and then more lies. It\u2019s concerning that you didn\u2019t feel comfortable enough to tell your gf what your realistic budget would be\u2014 if you couldn\u2019t do that without worrying about her reaction, do not get married yet. Why the rush? It\u2019s only been 8 months and you\u2019re both so young. It\u2019s also concerning that your fianc\u00e9 needed a real diamond. They are so expensive and it sounds like she has no idea how much they really cost. You\u2019re just starting out your careers and probably don\u2019t have much money to work with in the first place. \nCall her TONIGHT or meet up asap. do not wait. Tell her that you are very sorry for lying and the ring isn\u2019t real. Tell her that you felt immense pressure to deliver a real (and big) diamond because of how adamant she has been about it. Say you didn\u2019t want to disappoint her so you found another way, but you realize it\u2019s wrong and needed to come clean. \nSomeday you can give her the ring she wants (hopefully she learns to be less materialistic and manage her expectations) but it won\u2019t be any time soon and she\u2019s gotta be okay with that. What\u2019s more important to her, the ring or the relationship? You\u2019re clearly not at the place in your relationship yet where you can be honest about everything, and that comes with time and trust that you build together. Being honest now will be a good start for the future.", "YTA!\n\n1) for lying but 2) ABSOLUTELY for the ring!\n\nEveryone is saying he is TA for his lying and not the ring-he is definitely TA for the ring too! His budget was $1000 or less-and he decides to do $20! He cheaped out! I have a natural diamond ring (4 small fairy diamonds) that cost $375 as a grad present from my boyfriend in 2020-OP has zero excuse for the $20 ring! \n\nYour girlfriend didn\u2019t say she wanted perfect diamonds or big diamonds-just natural diamonds! That doesn\u2019t make her materialistic! You did *zero* research, Mr. software guy! The biggest decision of your life-to marry someone!-and you pick the first and cheapest item in your sponsored google search.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re not financially or emotionally mature enough to get married. This woman is about to have a career and she can buy her own diamonds or find a dude who can get her what she deserves because he values her, not because he wants to find the cheapest thing so he can marry her the fastest. (Also, upgrade her *engagement ring* in 5 to 10 years from now? 5 to 10 years into your marriage? Upgrade her $20 amazon ring, which will certainly be tarnished in a matter of months, 5 to 10 years from now? What are you even saying??)", "Mate, yta, I wouldn\u2019t like to be you when she finds out!", "YTA. Silver tarnishes so she's going to notice quite quickly. No one sets diamonds in silver.\n\nShould have gotten a chip. You've been together 8 months and you're 22 and 21. Waiting is a sensible option.", "YTA. Do you really think a $20 silver ring is going to hold up for *5-10 YEARS* before you were to upgrade it?? You\u2019re lucky if you\u2019ll get 6 months out of it before it starts to tarnish. I get that the diamond industry is a scam, but engagement rings are a piece of **investment jewelry**. When you purchase one, you want to go for something that is durable and long lasting. Some engagement rings even become family heirlooms! Not only that, but you\u2019re starting your marriage on a huge LIE, and your soon to be ex fianc\u00e9e is going to be beyond livid when she finds out you betrayed her trust. This is only going to get real messy real quick.", "YTA. You could have been honest about it from the start and saved yourself a world of hurt. Is she so unreasonable that she'd expect you to spend thousands more than expected? I doubt it, but if so, that's a problem on its own. You could have faced up to that and been honest. Now, you either have to keep it a secret *forever* and hope she *never* finds out, or tell her and she'll be rightfully upset with you for lying about it. But at least if you do it now and not in five years, she might understand the conflict that happened in your head.", "YTA for lying about it. This is going to blow up in your face in a spectacular way. If you had been honest with her from the start she would have been disappointed and upset but not nearly as much as much as she will be when she finds out about your lies.", "YTA. You are starting your married life with one big lie. Of course its going to blow up your face. Tell her the truth.", "YTA. Sterling silver tarnishes very fast, especially if not taken care of properly and treated like you would actual silver. Not to mention that it\u2019s likely not made to last if it was only $20. You\u2019ll be lucky if it doesn\u2019t fall apart before you get to talk to her or if she figures it out on her own. If she finds out accidentally she\u2019ll likely be more pissed that you lied to her than if you just came clean yourself. \n\nAt best, you could say that you want her to know that this is a temporary ring until you can afford the Real Deal. You want her to have what shes dreamt of but aren\u2019t able to get exactly that right now, so this is a filler in the mean time. You wanted to tell her when you proposed but she got so excited and you got so swept up in the moment and the emotions it didn\u2019t feel right. Then you better start saving for the actual thing and follow through.", "YTA\n\nCome on, dude. You're seriously starting out your marriage with nothing but lies? Do you think that's love? You could have spent a little more than $20. You could also talk to her. That you don't have the money for a real diamond now, but one day you will. You don't trust her enough to be honest with her. So either you're the toxic one or she is.", "As someone who's wearing a $20 silver ring with garnets from Amazon to replace my engagement ring when the diamond came loose after 12 years of wearing (on top of the ring originally being a family ring from the 70's), YTA.\n\nBecause you lied and because you did it to be cheap. You didn't buy a cheap Amazon ring, because other rings were too expensive, you bought a cheap Amazon ring because you were being cheap.  You could have spent a few hundred (seriously $100-$300) on Etsy and bought her a real diamond ring, small for sure, but real, and told her in a few years you'd upgrade it, but you wouldn't be lying. \n\nShe WILL find out, silver does not wear the same way as gold, and if she's ever in a pool with it on it will tarnish to black quickly and she'll realize it fast.  Or they'll tell her when she goes to get it insured, or when she takes it off and checks the makers marks, or when she goes to get it cleaned.  Then she will be your exfianc\u00e9e .   \n\nAll this could have been saved by simply asking her if she'd be okay with a cheaper ring until the two of you can afford a better one.", "YTA. Not for the cheap ring, but for the lie. You're proposing to this person. Saying you want to spend the rest of your life with her. And yet you have no problem with deceiving her in that exact sam4 moment. So disrespectful.\n\nAnd you're going to get caught. Cubic zirconia clouds. It sparkles fine when you first get it, but it looks like frozen spit soon enough. There are higher quality diamond subs, but you aren't getting them for 20 bucks on Amazon. Silver develops a patina that white gold doesn't. It's very noticeable. And before all of that happens, she's probably going to get the ring appraised for insurance. Appraisers aren't hoping to be fooled.", "YTA you could have found a quality ring that would hold up for cheaper but you went for Walmart level\u2026 that\u2019s gonna show wear and tear within a few months", "Yes. This will blow up.  The stone may crack; perhaps a family member will suggest that you get a rider for it on your homeowner\u2019s insurance, and you will have to provide an appraisal\u2026something will happen. You are far better off figuring out how to tell her and coming clean.  \n\nRegardless of whether she is right or wrong to want it, YWBTAH for continually lying to your fianc\u00e9e.  The lies would eat you up, anyway.  Good luck.", "She is in for a surprise when she goes to get it insured. This will blow up in your face sooner than later. I don\u2019t like her attitude towards natural stones, but there were so many other choices you had. Come clean immediately before this gets really messy.", "YTA\nDon't start your larriage on a lie.\nIf you don't tell ger the value, I guarantee you that she will get it valued herself and you'll be more screwed", "YTA, and she WILL find out and you won't be getting married or even in the relationship any more.\n\nIf it was outside your budget you should have been clear and set expectations from the start, or worked with her to find something she likes without the massive price tag and saved up for a few more months.\n\nYou're now so enmeshed in the lies you have told you're going to slip up, and the longer you leave it the bigger the fallout will be when she finds out.\n\nI award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.", "YTA. How you approach the inevitable conflicts and compromises that will happen when getting engaged and planning the wedding is generally a good touchstone for how you approach marriage itself - and you have decided to start that by deliberately (repeatedly and elaborately) deceiving your fianc\u00e9e in order to hide the fact that you don't respect her wishes and you're sure you know best. \n\nAnd you don't know best. Because in the process of ignoring her wishes, you've bought her a cheap and nasty knock-off that will make her finger go green when the plating wears off - which it will, because $20 is not the price you'd be paying for a sterling silver ring and plated rings are not made to be worn every day! This is what we call a \"suicide lie\" or a \"time bomb lie\" - it's guaranteed to get found out, and the longer it goes on, the worse it gets when it is inevitably discovered.\n\nMarriage should be started with honesty. *\"I'm sorry, I can't find a ring within our budget that's the style you like.\"*\n\n*\"I'm sorry, but I think we're going to have to look at vintage rings rather than new in order to get you a natural diamond within our budget.\"*\n\n*\"I'm sorry, I can't afford to spend $1000 on a ring right now - can we talk about our budget for that, and alternative stones you might like?\"*\n\nOr even *\"Would you mind having a cheap placeholder ring until I can afford to get you a really good one?\"*\n\nHeck, it's not even mandatory to propose with a ring! Many people find it all the more romantic to go ring shopping together as the first celebration of their engagement, cementing their partnership with the first financial decision they'll make together. \n\nYou could have made this decision together and used your fianc\u00e9e as a resource to help you find other ring options. Instead you went behind her back and overrode the decisions you had made together. And now you keep digging yourself further and further into a hole in order to cover up that initial mistake. With every extra lie piled upon lie, you have single-handedly turned this from a stupid misjudgement into a major betrayal of her trust. \n\nYour only hope is a full and complete confession before she figures it out for herself - and she will, because one of the first things people tend to do is put important jewellery on their home insurance, and that is likely to need an appraisal from a jeweller if the ring doesn't have documentation with it - and a full and genuine apology for tangling yourself up in so many lies.", "She\u2019s going to find out lol. If you got a 20$ ring it\u2019s probably silver so you know the stamp inside it 929? That means it\u2019s silver. When she takes it to a jeweller to get cleaned because they do complimentary cleaning they will tell her. Silver also does not wear as well as white gold it will oxidise and look really cheap and dirty which is why she will want to get it cleaned. \n\nOr when she decides to get an insurance policy on it and needs a valuation done. \n\nAlso cubic zirconia doesn\u2019t stay clear, it goes cloudy with wear and tear (hot water) \n\n~former jewellery worker. \n\nShould have told her the truth and not lied about it.

I hope she comes to her senses and breaks off the engagement.", "YTA for lying about it", "She was VERY SPECIFIC about what she wanted and there is really no rush to propose.

This is not how relationships work.", "YTA. What you should have done is sat her down and showed her the prices of the rings that she wanted. Tell her that it is way out of your budget. You could have discussed picking out another ring as a placeholder until you can afford the type of diamond she likes or maybe another type stone. But instead you lied, and bought her a $20 ring.

You didn\u2019t have to get a $20 ring from Amazon.", "YTA, typically fine jewelry is inspected twice yearly by the jewelry store for the warranty.\nYou really messed up. Just tell her now before its too late, she is going to be very upset though.", "Even though I regret the tradition that men must splurge on something like an engagement ring, I don't understand her obsession, and she seems clueless, you are an asshole for lying.

Please update when it blows up in ur face. She\u2019s going to go to jeweler and find out. Better tell her now.", "YTA. A bucketload of lies is not a way to start an engagement\u2026 you better come clean now, because if she finds out without you telling her first, she\u2019s definitely going to leave you.", "When she figures out you lied and the kept lying and lying as she asked questions, she is going to leave you.

YTA but also you\u2019re an idiot", "YTA. A big one at that. You do know that this fake ring will turn her fingers green after a few times of washing her hands right? She will definitely know when that happens. Not to mention you could have gotten a ring with a real diamond under 1k. My husband got me 2 real diamond engagement rings under 1k each. My first he got was an old ring that was $500. Then he upgraded my ring when he got a better paying job and it was $300 but the difference is my first ring only has 1 diamond and my 2nd ring has more diamonds. Plus they both have warranty on them on top of my wedding band which also has real diamonds and was $300. But lastly, all of your lies are about to catch up to you and it won't be good.", "YTA. you said you wanted to get a jumpstart on the wedding planning and so this was a reason why you proposed? you could\u2019ve started planning without the proposal, waited until you were in a more comfortable position financially to buy a real diamond ring and you wouldn\u2019t have told her a mountain of lies. i\u2019m sure she would\u2019ve appreciated this more, especially since this was done in front of both families too", "Ah, yes!  Starting a marriage off based on a series of lies!  That is SO going to end well.\n\n/s\n\nYTA.  And soon, you\u2019ll be a single asshole.\n\nCongrats on your super short engagement!", "Yta for lying to your fianc\u00e9.

When I started ring shopping, I wasn't even in the same universe with the budget I had. Even the online engagement rings that were supposedly \"more affordable\" were priced 3 times my expected budget.\n\nI ended up looking at \"fake\" diamond rings that look like the real deal. Based on my research, I found that a Sterling Silver band with Cubic Zirconia as the stone was not only similar to the real deal, but it was only $20 on Amazon! I figure I can get this ring and then when we're ready, I can just suggest that we upgrade the current ring she has. Maybe 5 or 10 years from now.\n\nWhen she saw the ring she LOVED it. She said it was exactly what she had dreamed of and started asking about how I found a \"natural\" diamond that was so flawless and clear. I don't even remember the BS answer I came up with, but she rebuttaled with \"where did you buy it?\"...\"how much did it cost?\"...\"does it have a lifetime warranty?\" I wasn't expecting this sort of interrogation and now I'm having to keep track of all the lies I've made since she has been talking about the ring ALL NIGHT. To make matters worse, both of our families were present for the proposal and engagement after-party. They were impressed by my budget ring as well.\n\nI think she'll calm down with the questions after a week or so, and I really feel like the decision I made was the best option for our future from a financial standpoint. If I tell her, I know she'll be upset, but I don't think I'll need to since she'll never take the ring to have the diamonds tested or anything like that. It's not like anyone else knew the difference either!\n\nAITA for thinking about this from a financial standpoint and setting up our future, or will this blow up in my face somehow with the lies I've been having to tell?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When it comes to marriage it\u2019s not just about what you want. It\u2019s what both parties agree on.\n\nAnd lastly, that\u2019s exactly how I got married. We went to the courthouse and got fast food after just the 2 of us. No regrets but I did want a huge diamond ring (that took years to upgrade to) sooo it\u2019s not mutually exclusive.", "People are allowed to have preferences. I don't have a real diamond ring preference, but people can have it. If this bothered him that much, he could have chosen to have a conversation about this as a grown-up who is trying to get married.", "A steel ring would mostly cost more. I often buy steel jewellery and they aren't this cheap.", "I'm not sure we can really make a judgement about her being materialistic. She has preferences, sure, but would we say she was materialistic for wanting a green stone instead of a red? Or for wanting a bouquet picked from a friend's garden  instead of commercially-farmed flowers? \n\nSo why is she materialistic for wanting a natural diamond? Yes, it's functionally the same stone as lab-created, and yes there are ethical issues with diamond mining which need to be considered, but at the end of the day why shouldn't she have a preference for something created by natural geological processes?", "Yeah, I\u2019ve definitely found some real sterling on Amazon for less than $20! They aren\u2019t super fancy rings, like one is just bent into the first letter of my name, but they\u2019re real! I don\u2019t ever take off my rings, like every blue moon to clean clean them, and they\u2019re all like three years or older (one I haven\u2019t taken off for 9 years!) and still look good to me!", "I was just thinking my ring was \u00a314 on sale \ud83e\udd23 I'm forever being complimented on it as no one seems to be able to tell it's not really expensive/ fancy. It's not discoloured or any damages to it so it's definitely doable as you said x", "I think you can probably infer from the post and all of the comments here that that is very cheap, instead of being deliberately obtuse.\n\nBudget of $1000. Bought a ring for $20.\n\nLet's think about this.", "That\u2019s every single gold jewelry. I don\u2019t see the point for this comment? Unless you get pure gold which is too soft to be everyday jewelry both yellow and white 14k gold jewelry have roughly 58% gold. The rest are fillers.", "I highly doubt she was concerned over the price due to insurance purposes, but whatever. Thanks for the unsolicited advice, wasn't really needed though.", "Have you looked up \"diamond mining\"? A preference for \"natural diamonds\" (there is a massive lack of the words \"ethically sourced\") is like a preference for real fur, whale steaks and shark finn soup.", "I think pretentious - not necessarily materialistic. \n\nShe want a natural diamond- but she thinks this ring has great color and clarity - which you can\u2019t determine with the naked eye. She want a natural diamond (and I\u2019m assuming a decent size one if she\u2019s thought about it enough to have a preference for natural over cultured) and think $1000 is anything close to enough to get what she wants.", "Yeah that\u2019s completely fair. Assuming she\u2019s materialistic was a bit much, he should\u2019ve communicated properly. Hopefully OP can save this situation, and it can be a learning lesson for both of them on communication", "Agree on that, moreover I would be pissed too. However it is possible to get silver for that price, in/from India for example. Don't know how likely it is for him to get real silver for that price in Murrica tho. Anyhow, he could have bought real gold with small diamonds for a grand.", "You\u2019re the one who called a woman with reasonable expectations materialistic. If she\u2019s materialistic, I truly wonder how you live your life. You must not have anything!", "Yeah regardless, hopefully OP comes clean about everything and they have a conversation about the situation because him lying was wrong.", ">she thinks this ring has great color and clarity - which you can\u2019t determine with the naked eye\n\nYes and no. You can absolutely see scintillation with the naked eye, and cubic zirconia does have a similar optical phenomenon, but you aren't necessarily going to count the colours and realise that there's only blue and orange showing rather than a full rainbow. Not unless you're actively looking for a fake. \n\nSimilarly, the structure of cubic zirconia means that it appears to have greater clarity than most natural diamonds - a bright flat white, rather than being slightly grey, brown or yellow. And you absolutely can see that colour difference with the naked eye.\n\nSo I really don't think she is being pretentious. She is just making a judgement on the diamond's appearance based on her trust in OP having *actually* bought a diamond like they agreed on, and possibly having expected to accept a diamond that has visible inclusions and/or isn't bright white because of the budget restrictions.", "She can have reasonable expectations while still being materialistic. They aren't mutually exclusive. As you pointed out, it is a bit hypocritical of me to call her out for being materialistic. I collect MTG cards, if I bought one online, and learned it was fake, I would be livid. It doesn't really matter though since it's all stupid cardboard and is the epitome of materialism.\n\nI just think it's silly to spend thousands of dollars on jewelry when there are much cheaper options and she obviously can't tell the difference. OP's fiancee probably would think my card collection hobby is just as silly since I have spent thousands of dollars on cardboard. I still think she is being materialistic, but you have a good point, I really shouldn't fault her for that.", "That\u2019s a good point. You are right they really aren\u2019t mutually exclusive at the end of the day.\n\nAnd I mean ya I agree. Mined jewelry is overrated when you can make a lot in the lab and have it look great for a fraction of the cost. The issue is he only spent $20 when his initial budget was $1000. She didn\u2019t demand he spend thousands. And CZ eventually gets cloudy and you can\u2019t clean it. It gets \u201cdirty\u201d from the inside. \n\nBut, like you said if you got a fake magic card you\u2019d be livid because it\u2019s important to you. Other people might not know the difference and if someone else gifted you that fake card, you might not know any better either! A diamond is important to her though so as her partner OP should\u2019ve placed some importance in it too."]}
