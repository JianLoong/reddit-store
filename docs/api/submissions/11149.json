For some context my parents for divorced when I was 12, I have two siblings, an older brother and a younger brother. My dad remarried two years after the divorce, his new wife already had a daughter (f22) and they have three more kids together. \n\nAfter the divorce my mom got custody over us and we visited my dad in weekends. I don't have a good relationship either with his wife or with his stepdaughter. His wife always tried to be our \"new mom\" which neither me or my brothers liked, and her daughter would always try to fight for our dad's attention with us, especially me since we were both girls. Because of this we never really liked each other and that hasn't changed over the years.\n\nBack to the baby shower. My boyfriend and I decided to celebrate it this month as I'm already feeling too tired from my pregnancy and want to spend the last months in my house. We sent everyone the invitations like 2 weeks ago and it was already an issue since my dad called me and told me if the date was right since it was his step daughter's birthday, I confirmed the date and we didn't spoke about that again. My dad showed up at the baby shower with two of my hald siblings but neither his wife or step daughter did which honestly wasn't a problem for me. But then I got messages from both of them telling me that what I did was awful because my dad wasn't able to spend his \"daughter's\" birthday with her and they weren't able to attend the baby shower, I told them my dad could've chosen to not attend the baby shower and stay home with then if he'd like it, therefore is not my problem and its something they have to solve themselves.

Unless your step-sister is actually a secret affair child between your father and step-mother before the divorce happened, his first daughter is You.

She's 22, not 12.

Also, sounds like you two don\u2019t have a great relationship. And I will always have grace for a pregnant woman carrying twins in last trimester. That sounds beyond exhausting.\n\nHowever, I suspect there may be an element of sibling rivalry going on here, especially if you knew in advance that it was her birthday.

Your dad has seemingly allowed this fighting over his attention to get in the way of his relationship with you. Does she not have her own father? What 22yo wants to spend their birthday with their step dad? Is she not going to have a birthday next year whereas your baby shower for your children is a one time event? Did you force your dad to be there? Seems like you picked that date so you could have a venue and allow yourself the rest you needed for the remainder of your pregnancy.

I mean technically you can hold the event on whatever day you want, especially if you TRULY would not have been upset if your dad and siblings had decided not to come.

You don't have a relationship with her, and you were not obligated to plan around her birthday at all. If my birthday falls on a weekday, I celebrated another day.

You don't need the stress right now.", "ESH.\n\nhaving a baby shower at 6 months is already kind of early, considering most do it at 32 weeks+. having it then does not solely make you TA, but knowing it was her birthday, you could have very easily chosen any other weekend this month and still celebrated super early. you say that she was fighting for his attention, but you seem jealous and like you are as well. whether you like it or not, you're both his children now.\n\nhowever, at 22, your birthday is not as important as a once in a lifetime event like a baby shower. she also could have celebrated on a different day - the weekend has 2 (maybe even 3) days that you can celebrate outside of regular working hours. most people don't celebrate on the day of, anyway, and at 22, a huge family event is strange (and even more strange if you and your brothers were not invited).", "YTA 100%", "YTA - grow up, you have a child on the way", "NTA\n\nIt was a 22nd birthday.  As an adult, if you do celebrate, it is in the evening with a dinner. The shower was a couple of hours in the afternoon. So what is the conflict?\n\nOP doesn't have a relation with her stepsister, so why should she be considerate of that date. It was a convenient date for her, for the venue and for how she felt at that point in the progress of her pregnancy.\n\nThe only drama is being made by stepsister and her mom as she probably wanted her stepfather to ignore the bio daughter and her baby shower altogether. \n\nI have the feeling that a lot of people choosing Y T A are still quite young, and want their own birthday to be special and want the whole day to be all about them.", "NTA. Birthdays are not sacrosanct as an adult.  Showers are a few hours out of a day.  All the adults were able to decide what to do that day.  Some opted to attend the shower, other not.", "You knew it was her birthday, so YTA", "YTA...I was going with NTA until I saw that you picked the date of your baby shower, knew it was her birthday, and didn't invite her to the shower. It was well within your right not to invite her given your relationship. However, you were being spiteful by having it that particular day, and you know it. She's probably right about you being a selfish brat. I can totally see you throwing it in her face that your dad came to your shower instead.", "YTA. At least own up to it.", "YTA. Why are you even asking here? You knew it's your SS's birthday and you did it with malicious purpose. Stop being petty and start being a grown up now that you have a baby.", "YTA.

You're not obligated to make things easier for your stepsister, but would it have been that horrible to change the date so your father and half siblings didn't have to choose between the two of you? Also, the whole ordeal of your stepmom and stepsister messaging you is so childish and ridiculous.", "yeah, YTA. first off, you don't throw your own shower. and you chose the day knowing it was her birthday.", "Yta for throwing dad under the bus and saying he could have gone to her bday yet you would have pitched a tantrum if he had.", "YTA. Looking at your comments, you knew it was her birthday. You purposefully chose to put your father in a horrible position because you're apparently not adult enough to be willing to work things out with your stepsister. No one expects you to get along all of the time, but you have to accept that your dad is the stepdad to someone and has to also show love to that other person. \n\nI hope that this is just the pregnancy hormones and that you're not this petty normally.", "I think it was petty and cruel. I think it says more about what kinda of person (and frankly makes me wonder how much of what you said is true) you are than any of the negative stuff you say about them.

The issue is that you admit that you two have fought over your dad's attention. She can not help when her birthday is, nor the fact that your dad is not her bio dad. The fact is your dad is her dad, regardless of biology. You have stated that you threw this shower and knew about what day your step sister's birthday is. You state that your dad found out from the invitation, which is where you become the asshole. You assumed he would automatically go to your babyshower. You assumed your stepsister could not possibly have had her birthday celebrations around your babyshower. You put him in an uncomfortable position for no reason. If the venue was the issue, then you could've explained before the invites to try to establish a little wiggle room for her party or even skip the shower since you said you didn't care about it if not for the venue.", "nta, they weren't nice to you so why should you give a hoot?", "YTA because you knew it was her birthday and did this purposely for your dad to choose!

Who has a 24 hour party for their birthday. I mean we usually just have a cake with dinner or go out to eat.  Who has to monopolize everyone\u2019s day all day for their birthday at 22. ridiculous .  I mean both can be done.", "Yay! I believe the mods will check if you leave it as-is, but if you space out the judgements after the first one the bot can do it.\n\nSeriously, I can't even with the anti-birthday people. I have no opinion on how these strangers should feel about their celebrations respectively, but it's super clear from the details and tone of OP's comments that it was at least a little designed to upset the sister (at the very least it was a perk of the timing). She could have waited a single day and not put their father in the middle, for god's sake.", "That's the true crime here.", "Totally overlooked that.

But I\u2019m not going to sit here and say someone\u2019s an asshole for doing it. OP chose to celebrate when they had availability, they weren\u2019t being spiteful. They don\u2019t have SS as part of their life so it wasn\u2019t to spite her and take the dad away. Again they could of done something before or after.

She had been my friend since we were like 12, so she knew it was my birthday. And you know what I did about it? I was her bridesmaid. I didn't even mention it was my birthday. I had a fantastic time celebrating my friends. I celebrated me on a different day. This is what adults do.  \nA 22 year old being upset that her step sister had a baby shower on her birthday is ridiculous. It was a few hours at most; she had the rest of the day and evening to celebrate her birthday with her step-dad.  \nNTA OP. Congratulations on your baby.", "Nah. Usually I'd agree but based on OPs comments she did it to cause drama then wants to act shocked that the drama is there.", "Except she was.

How is that her fault he didn't call her back to say he couldn't make it so in conclusion he must of already made up his mind that he was going", "Your situation is completely different lol. Usually I'd say whatever it's a day but she was intentionally spiteful.", "I respect that opinion, really, I just don\u2019t happen to agree.

Because it was also the earliest the venue she wanted could get them in, and at 6 months pregnant with twins, any later could mean she would be too big/tired to comfortably attend her own shower, especially that she's already feeling the effects of a twin pregnancy.

I wouldn\u2019t really care if it was her bday or not, like majority of people are able to recognize: a baby shower is not the whole day.
