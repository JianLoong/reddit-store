For some context my parents for divorced when I was 12, I have two siblings, an older brother and a younger brother. My dad remarried two years after the divorce, his new wife already had a daughter (f22) and they have three more kids together. \n\nAfter the divorce my mom got custody over us and we visited my dad in weekends. I don't have a good relationship either with his wife or with his stepdaughter. His wife always tried to be our \"new mom\" which neither me or my brothers liked, and her daughter would always try to fight for our dad's attention with us, especially me since we were both girls. Because of this we never really liked each other and that hasn't changed over the years.\n\nBack to the baby shower. My boyfriend and I decided to celebrate it this month as I'm already feeling too tired from my pregnancy and want to spend the last months in my house. We sent everyone the invitations like 2 weeks ago and it was already an issue since my dad called me and told me if the date was right since it was his step daughter's birthday, I confirmed the date and we didn't spoke about that again. My dad showed up at the baby shower with two of my hald siblings but neither his wife or step daughter did which honestly wasn't a problem for me. But then I got messages from both of them telling me that what I did was awful because my dad wasn't able to spend his \"daughter's\" birthday with her and they weren't able to attend the baby shower, I told them my dad could've chosen to not attend the baby shower and stay home with then if he'd like it, therefore is not my problem and its something they have to solve themselves.

Unless your step-sister is actually a secret affair child between your father and step-mother before the divorce happened, his first daughter is You. You should be a priority regardless since this is a celebration of you becoming a mother for the first time, whereas your stepsister is an adult who can handle a few hours of her birthday like many adults do--not getting everything their way. She's 22, not 12. I don't even get much acknowledgment on my own birthday, and didn't even celebrate my 22nd because I was several states away from most of my family and my dead-beat boyfriend didn't have a job and I worked.", "YTA, and petty.

Also, sounds like you two don\u2019t have a great relationship. And I will always have grace for a pregnant woman carrying twins in last trimester. That sounds beyond exhausting.\n\nHowever, I suspect there may be an element of sibling rivalry going on here, especially if you knew in advance that it was her birthday. That probably made it a little sweeter. It\u2019s reasonable for them to be disappointed at the scheduling conflict, although calling you a \u201cselfish brat\u201d was probably over the top.", "Of course YTA.

Unfortunately, the optics of choosing this date are bad, simply because you didn't get along, and it looks like a deliberate way of snubbing.

Your dad has seemingly allowed this fighting over his attention to get in the way of his relationship with you. Does she not have her own father? What 22yo wants to spend their birthday with their step dad? Is she not going to have a birthday next year whereas your baby shower for your first child is a one time event? Did you force your dad to be there? Seems like you picked that date so you could have a venue and allow yourself the rest you needed for the remainder of your pregnancy.

A bit of me is suspecting this is the case, but you'd only know that.\n\nEither way, it's your choice.   Just accept your relationship with your father is changing.\n\nEDIT > See you scheduled this KNOWING it was overlapping the SS birthday.

I mean technically you can hold the event on whatever day you want, especially if you TRULY would not have been upset if your dad and siblings had decided not to come. But still, you know in setting the date that you were making those people choose; I suspect you would have avoided the birthday of OTHER family members in order to allow them to celebrate without having to also make room for your shower, and to avoid conflicts in making loved ones choose.

You are free to invite whomever whenever you like, people are free to either  attend or not. Seriously what's the problem with those, who say \"YTA\".

Ridiculous.", "I'm going with ESH.\n\nYou're right in that your dad could have done both easily and your stepsister/stepmother made a bigger deal out of it.\n\nThat being said, it does sound like you deliberately chose the date, knowing it was your stepsister's birthday and knowing you two have issues with each other. Even if it was not a conscious decision, you still started drama when there didn't need to be any. You could have chosen a different day.\n\nThat's why I think everyone is at fault here.

You don't have a relationship with her, and you were not obligated to plan around her birthday at all. If my birthday falls on a weekday, I celebrated another day.

Doing it with intent is a dick move. \n\nIf you planned an early event for a couple of hours fitting the waning energy of a soon-to-be mom, I'd say N T A because there'd be plenty of time to celebrate a birthday in the evening and make it special. \n\nThing is, I suspect you chose the former.", "NTA.

It won\u2019t detect the \u201cYTA\u201d decision otherwise.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23", "Lmao this is beautiful. Thank you", "At which point the father would be an asshole in OPs and most of reddits eyes for missing his daughters baby shower to spend it with his step daughter on her birthday.\n\nOP forced her dad to choose between them or limit what he could do with his step daughter on the day, simple to spite the step daughter or reduce the likelihood of her and step mum attending. The texts say the father missed out on her birthday, so maybe they had a meal planned for the same time as the baby shower or planned on doing a day trip away or something. They clearly had something planned at the same time as the shower since step mum and sister didn't attend the shower but text like they wanted too.", ">She is a step sister, I\u2019m not sure why her birthday would be significant to you.\n\nIt's not. But it's significant to OPs dad who happens to be the step-sister's step-dad. This is peak Main Character syndrome right here.", "Your sister is a grown-ass adult. Baby showers are an afternoon thing. Adult birthdays are dinner at a restaurant 90% of the time. There\u2019s no conflict.", "Adults can celebrate how they wish including wanting an actual party or special day", "Really. I had to go back and check the age of the stepsister - 22?! And mommy had to stay home with her??", "I was gonna type this, decided to check the comments, and low and behold! Instead of it just happening to be on her step sister's bday since OP is not close with step sis, she did it on purpose. Solid 20/10 dick move. YTA, OP.", "She said she chose the day on purpose, knowing it was her stepsister's birthday.", "This was my thought too, whether she likes her stepsister or not, this was a decision that put stress on her dad when it didn\u2019t need to be there. No reason to make him choose between his kids.", "OP [absolutely knew it was her birthday](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ee8c8/aita_for_celebrating_my_baby_shower_the_same_day/jadi4ky).", "I picked the closest date the venue had available, i realized it was her birthday but since she wasn't even invited I didn't care. I just wanted it to be done so I can rest during the rest of my pregnancy.", "Why would she have the birthday of a stepsibling she only saw on weekends for a few years memorized?", "You woke up & chose violence today", "Then why did he attend op\u2019s baby shower instead of the stepsister\u2019s birthday?", "Ah thanks - see that now.", "Then YTA. You wanted drama, you got drama.", "I think all the N T A responses don't realize you knew it was her birthday. Seems like you got exactly what you were going for. YTA.", "How could I have known they have something planned? It's been years since I don't get invited to their birthdays", "No lmao I\u2019m pretty sure main character syndrome is the step daughter who thinks the world stops for  the entirety of her 22nd birthday. Op literally said her dad could have just not come and it wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal. It\u2019s not her fault her dad has a needy adult step daughter nor is it her issue to plan around.", "Yeah but as adults, they should also be mature enough to realize their \u201cspecial day\u201d doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. I\u2019d say NTA for this situation specifically but realistically ESH cause all y\u2019all are petty af.", "Yes of course they can! But to throw a tantrum as an adult because your step sister is having a baby shower on your birthday? That\u2019s so incredibly immature", "Lol, then why didn't you do it weeks ago?", "Uh or you just don\u2019t take into consideration everyone\u2019s opinion on dates? I didn\u2019t and chose the date I wanted and it was my best friends husband bday weekend and she still showed up instead of going out of town", "This is one reason why you shouldn\u2019t throw your own shower. Seems to happen a lot these days but it has always been considered improper, a gift grab. If a friend or other family hosted it, you would have plausible deniability on the date. You could have said you just told the friend you wanted it this month, and she found and booked the perfect venue for it and didn\u2019t check on the date with you until it was too late.", "Ah then according to the new information OP  is YTA", "NTA.", "But her dad is. She purposefully put her dad and half siblings in a difficult situation in order to spite her stepsister.\n\nAnd if she's this petty about a baby shower she threw for herself, don't doubt that she would withhold access to the twins, if her dad chose to skip the baby shower to celebrate with his stepdaughter that lives with him fulltime, and whom he presumably has a closer relationship to.", "Edit: Just saw OP knew the date. Stepsister is an adult, and the shower was only a few hours, so the Y T As are a bit ridiculous.", "Pity for OP. He spent most of the day with his other daughter.", "Exactly, she's 22. The shower was a couple of hours leaving the rest of the day to do something. What is it about adults freaking out about something else happening on THEIR BIRTHDAY?  Yes, there are 365 days in a year and billions of people, you do the math. Other important things are going to happen on your birthday, sometimes even nationwide holidays if you're unlucky or lucky depending on how you look at it.", "Yeah, I asked because I wanted to know if she genuinely forgot since they are not close or if she did it knowingly. I need to change my other comment to ESH. She's the AH for doing it on purpose. SS and SM are AHs because she fricking turned 22. Adult. Most adults don't spend every birthday with their parents. AND baby showers don't last all day. They could've gone to the shower and still did something for her birthday. Everyone is being petty!", "Yeah, I posted NTA with a (assuming you didn't do it on purpose).\n\nEdited :) :)", "Most people will do something on their birthday, even if it's just spending time together or going out for a meal.\n\nYou won't have known if they had plans, but you have to know the chance was significantly higher they would be doing something on her birthday than say the week before or after.", "OP, YTA here. \n\nYou admitted to knowing it was her birthday. You created unnecessary turmoil for your dad simply because you don't like his stepdaughter. I understand that you're 20 and extremely hormonal, but you're about to be a mother. You need to step up a bit. \n\nIf your dad hadn't shown up, you would have been complaining and crying that he chose his stepdaughter over you, further cementing a bad relationship with you. Maybe you'd be threatening to withhold the grandkids from him. \n\nYou put him in an incredibly difficult situation simply to be petty about the stepsister you didn't agree with nor like in high school. \n\nIf this was literally the *only* day you could schedule the baby shower, I guess I could lean more towards E S H, but honestly...please don't deprive your kids of a relationship with their grandfather simply because you dislike your stepsister. Don't traumatize kids over pettiness and old disagreements that have nothing to do with them.\n\nGood luck, and I hope the rest of your pregnancy and delivery go smoothly.", "Yes!! I take my own bday very seriously but if an event fell on my day I wouldn\u2019t expect the host to cancel. At least the dad still attended OP\u2019s baby shower despite everything they\u2019ve been through.", "It was the nearest date available at the venue, that's why i picked that date", "She hosted it herself? Really?", "I just picked the date since I wanted it to be as soon as possible, some friends and my boyfriend planned it.", "Makes sense to me and when you are approaching your third trimester with twins, you don\u2019t want to push it back further", "She says that she and her boyfriend decided when to have the baby shower and sent out the invitations\n\nEDIT: just saw OP\u2019s reply that her boyfriend and some friends hosted it", "Her boyfriend is (maybe, hopefully) also the parent of the child. So still self-hosted. I find that incredibly tacky, but that's my opinion and I don't have carnal knowledge or pay bills for these people, so that doesn't count for much. Maybe OP and her people don't think it's tacky. But, again, why on the KNOWN bday of a family member?", "I want to know why do you think it's tacky to plan your own party? Seems like it's the best option if you like to pick everything the way you want it to be, just seems practical"]}
