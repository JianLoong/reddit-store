For some context my parents for divorced when I was 12, I have two siblings, an older brother and a younger brother. My dad remarried two years after the divorce, his new wife already had a daughter (f22) and they have three more kids together. \n\nAfter the divorce my mom got custody over us and we visited my dad in weekends. I don't have a good relationship either with his wife or with his stepdaughter. His wife always tried to be our \"new mom\" which neither me or my brothers liked, and her daughter would always try to fight for our dad's attention with us, especially me since we were both girls. Because of this we never really liked each other and that hasn't changed over the years.\n\nBack to the baby shower. My boyfriend and I decided to celebrate it this month as I'm already feeling too tired from my pregnancy and want to spend the last months in my house. We sent everyone the invitations like 2 weeks ago and it was already an issue since my dad called me and told me if the date was right since it was his step daughter's birthday, I confirmed the date and we didn't spoke about that again. My dad showed up at the baby shower with two of my hald siblings but neither his wife or step daughter did which honestly wasn't a problem for me. But then I got messages from both of them telling me that what I did was awful because my dad wasn't able to spend his \"daughter's\" birthday with her and they weren't able to attend the baby shower, I told them my dad could've chosen to not attend the baby shower and stay home with then if he'd like it, therefore is not my problem and its something they have to solve themselves.

Unless your step-sister is actually a secret affair child between your father and step-mother before the divorce happened, his first daughter is You. You should be a priority regardless since this is a celebration of you becoming a mother for the first time, whereas your stepsister is an adult who can handle a few hours of her birthday like many adults do--not getting everything their way. She's 22, not 12. I don't even get much acknowledgment on my own birthday, and didn't even celebrate my 22nd because I was several states away from most of my family and my dead-beat boyfriend didn't have a job and I worked.", "YTA, and petty.

Also, sounds like you two don\u2019t have a great relationship. And I will always have grace for a pregnant woman carrying twins in last trimester. That sounds beyond exhausting.\n\nHowever, I suspect there may be an element of sibling rivalry going on here, especially if you knew in advance that it was her birthday. That probably made it a little sweeter. It\u2019s reasonable for them to be disappointed at the scheduling conflict, although calling you a \u201cselfish brat\u201d was probably over the top.", "Of course YTA.

Unfortunately, the optics of choosing this date are bad, simply because you didn't get along, and it looks like a deliberate way of snubbing.

Your dad has seemingly allowed this fighting over his attention to get in the way of his relationship with you. Does she not have her own father? What 22yo wants to spend their birthday with their step dad? Is she not going to have a birthday next year whereas your baby shower for your children is a one time event? Did you force your dad to be there? Seems like you picked that date so you could have a venue and allow yourself the rest you needed for the remainder of your pregnancy. An adult pitching a fit about their birthday is never a good look, and a couple of hours at your shower didn\u2019t prevent him from celebrating with her at all.

Just accept your relationship with your father is changing.\n\nEDIT > See you scheduled this KNOWING it was overlapping the SS birthday.

I mean technically you can hold the event on whatever day you want, especially if you TRULY would not have been upset if your dad and siblings had decided not to come. But still, you know in setting the date that you were making those people choose; I suspect you would have avoided the birthday of OTHER family members in order to allow them to celebrate without having to also make room for your shower, and to avoid conflicts in making loved ones choose.

You are free to invite whomever whenever you like, people are free to either  attend or not. Seriously what's the problem with those, who say \"YTA\".

Ridiculous.", "I'm going with ESH.\n\nYou're right in that your dad could have done both easily and your stepsister/stepmother made a bigger deal out of it.\n\nThat being said, it does sound like you deliberately chose the date, knowing it was your stepsister's birthday and knowing you two have issues with each other. Even if it was not a conscious decision, you still started drama when there didn't need to be any. You could have chosen a different day.\n\nThat's why I think everyone is at fault here.

You don't have a relationship with her, and you were not obligated to plan around her birthday at all. If my birthday falls on a weekday, I celebrated another day.

Doing it with intent is a dick move. \n\nIf you planned an early event for a couple of hours fitting the waning energy of a soon-to-be mom, I'd say N T A because there'd be plenty of time to celebrate a birthday in the evening and make it special. \n\nThing is, I suspect you chose the former.", "NTA.

I live near a mid-sized city, and locating a venue in my price range on the right date for every shower I\u2019ve thrown hasn\u2019t been easy.\n\nOp said she would have chosen an earlier date if she could have but for health reasons was unable to push it back.\n\nSS sounds very high maintenance. I don\u2019t blame Op for not liking her.", "I think your TA, but I agree with you here. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with doing your own baby shower. If anything, it saves your friends from having to take time and energy they don\u2019t have to throw you a party. \n\nI felt so uncomfortable at my bridal shower because I didn\u2019t control it and I don\u2019t like being fussed over.", "Because OP doesn\u2019t have another 3 months to celebrate a shower? Or could pick another venue?\n\nThe fact that you seem to think this is an ok thing to do leads me to believe you\u2019re rather spiteful too.\n\nETA: I know how to share a birthday, my cousin was born on my 2nd. I\u2019m still not a spiteful pos.", "Congrats, you won. Daddy came to your event and not your step sister's, hope you don't raise your kids to make their parents choose who they love more.", "You are nowhere near mature enough to raise a child. \n\nI hope you do some serious growing up in the next 3 months.", "I think OP needs the bedrest from being petty lol", "Being pregnant with twins is very difficult.\n\nHaving a shower while you can still move, open gifts, and participate is a wise choice (and unpack/clean/exchange the gifts etc.)\n\nWith multiples there\u2019s more risk, higher probability of ending up on bed rest, and chance of premature delivery.\n\nOp was limited to weekends that the venue was available.\n\nI can not imagine being a 22 year old adult and expecting that nobody ever schedule anything on my entire birthday. That\u2019s such a level of self-centered entitlement. There was still time for a birthday dinner and you can always celebrate a birthday on the previous/following day.", "She has no obligation to consider her at all. Why do you feel OP should take her step sister, who she doesn't like and doesn't have a relationship with (and for apparently good reason) into any decision or event she makes?\n\nWhy are you holding OP accountable for her father's decision? She is not responsible for her father's actions. If her step sis has a problem, she should take it up with him.", "Tell me you haven\u2019t been pregnant without telling me you haven\u2019t been pregnant.", "Just say you'd be like this too and move on hun. My opinion isn't changing. Being intentionally petty isn't a cute look."]}
