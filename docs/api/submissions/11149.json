For some context my parents for divorced when I was 12, I have two siblings, an older brother and a younger brother. My dad remarried two years after the divorce, his new wife already had a daughter (f22) and they have three more kids together. \n\nAfter the divorce my mom got custody over us and we visited my dad in weekends. I don't have a good relationship either with his wife or with his stepdaughter. His wife always tried to be our \"new mom\" which neither me or my brothers liked, and her daughter would always try to fight for our dad's attention with us, especially me since we were both girls. Because of this we never really liked each other and that hasn't changed over the years.\n\nBack to the baby shower. My boyfriend and I decided to celebrate it this month as I'm already feeling too tired from my pregnancy and want to spend the last months in my house. We sent everyone the invitations like 2 weeks ago and it was already an issue since my dad called me and told me if the date was right since it was his step daughter's birthday, I confirmed the date and we didn't spoke about that again. My dad showed up at the baby shower with two of my hald siblings but neither his wife or step daughter did which honestly wasn't a problem for me. But then I got messages from both of them telling me that what I did was awful because my dad wasn't able to spend his \"daughter's\" birthday with her and they weren't able to attend the baby shower, I told them my dad could've chosen to not attend the baby shower and stay home with then if he'd like it, therefore is not my problem and its something they have to solve themselves.

Unless your step-sister is actually a secret affair child between your father and step-mother before the divorce happened, his first daughter is You.

She's 22, not 12. I don't even get much acknowledgment on my own birthday, and didn't even celebrate my 22nd because I was several states away from most of my family and my dead-beat boyfriend didn't have a job and I worked.", "YTA, and petty.

Also, sounds like you two don\u2019t have a great relationship. And I will always have grace for a pregnant woman carrying twins in last trimester. That sounds beyond exhausting.\n\nHowever, I suspect there may be an element of sibling rivalry going on here, especially if you knew in advance that it was her birthday.

Your dad has seemingly allowed this fighting over his attention to get in the way of his relationship with you. Does she not have her own father? What 22yo wants to spend their birthday with their step dad? Is she not going to have a birthday next year whereas your baby shower for your children is a one time event? Did you force your dad to be there? Seems like you picked that date so you could have a venue and allow yourself the rest you needed for the remainder of your pregnancy.

I mean technically you can hold the event on whatever day you want, especially if you TRULY would not have been upset if your dad and siblings had decided not to come. But still, you know in setting the date that you were making those people choose; I suspect you would have avoided the birthday of OTHER family members in order to allow them to celebrate without having to also make room for your shower, and to avoid conflicts in making loved ones choose.

Even if it was not a conscious decision, you still started drama when there didn't need to be any. You could have chosen a different day.\n\nThat's why I think everyone is at fault here.

You don't have a relationship with her, and you were not obligated to plan around her birthday at all. If my birthday falls on a weekday, I celebrated another day.
