SIL, well meaning or not, was most definitely the asshole.   \n It's unclear who said you should appreciate that she was trying to give you back your family - but if that was the MIL then MIL is a minor asshole for telling you that you should appreciate this.  Tell SIL (and MIL if she thought you should be appreciative of the effort) that your relationship with your family is not up for discussion, that you appreciate that SIL thought she was helping but that you are an adult who has made a decision and you expect that decision to be respected.  SIL may have been trying to do what was best for you, but ultimately what is best for you is not her call.  It is yours.\n\nUnfortunately, it is difficult for people who don't have a shitty family to understand when others do.

It\u2019s all about her. Her thwarted wants, her sense of grievance, her belief that she is owed the world a certain kind of way. Try to think about it like that. Hold your boundaries, because she\u2019s not going to respect them, and don\u2019t engage with the substance of her grievances.

I caved at one point and said they could with the caveat that it couldn\u2019t be a surprise, it had to be small enough to be held at someone\u2019s home and I did not want to be involved in any way until it was time to show up. None of them could stick to that and kept complaining about each other to me. My mom and bio MIL complained about costs and the fact that step-MIL invited over 50 people just by herself (this outsizing the \u201chouse\u201d rule). Additionally the of the 50 people my step-MIL did invite, I knew maybe ten of them. I had a very small wedding (20 people total) and was uncomfortable with inviting strangers to my baby shower. I have known my husband since high school, so it\u2019s not like this was a family member who had been away for a couple of years- I\u2019ve known his family for decades. My step-MIL said that she invited friends who \u201cowed\u201d her since she went to their kids\u2019 weddings and baby showers. That is not the type of person I am.

Absolutely NTA.", "And what a strange hill to die on. Just why?", "This whole attitude always baffled me, or people who lost a relative they loved and are disgusted by people hating their own family.  I knew someone who had a dead brother and said as much about people who hate their siblings.  Someone said \"imagine if your brother was the biggest asshole\" and she said she preferred that to an urn on the shelf and I think they didn't quite get the hypothetical right.\n\nWe all have someone in our lives we don't like, maybe hate, maybe never want to see again, etc.  It's better to approach the hypothetical about asking if they have someone they deeply dislike being around or hate, then say \"well now you've found out you're related by blood.  You have to contact and get along with them and try to build a relationship because you're family and if family isn't there for family who will be?\" etc, etc\n\nInstead of projecting a loved one onto the hypothetical, use someone they know whose relationship closer resembles what having a shitty family member feels like.  It might make it easier for those people who don't get it to grasp more what it's like.\n\nFor me, yeah, my immediate family is intact and I love my parents and siblings, but... I don't remember ever questioning why my mom didn't have a dad, she just didn't.  I never questioned why we never met her half sisters, they just didn't (and don't) exist to us.  Two of her sisters got a divorce, both with children from it, one of them remarried and had more kids... my Grammy refused to speak to one of her sisters.  So I guess I just learned \"it's just like that sometimes\" and that it's better to keep the distance than force them together.  Never speaking again can, in fact, be the solution to some of these problems.", "What kind of idiot are you!? You don't invite known abusive people into your life! \n\nShe is actively keeping herself and her baby safe by not letting the SIL keep pulling her crap.\n\nYou need a reality check.", "You\u2019ve been trained since literally birth to take on responsibility for things that are not your fault so this is no surprise. Your SIL sucks. She is unfortunately operating under the bizarre delusion some people who grow up in good families are affected by where they think those of us who are estranged are being drama queens, over reacting, too sensitive\u2026 and if we\u2019d just reach out everyone would sing kumbayya and live happily ever after. This tension is not your fault whatsoever. It\u2019s SIL\u2019s for not respecting a boundary, not listening, not even taking into consideration how that would feel for you to ONCE AGAIN have family ignoring your needs and doing what they wanted instead of what you needed! She has no reason to be mad. She could have thrown a shower and been queen of the ball. All she had to do was not invite your bio family. She made the choice to pursue that road, after being amply warned, so clearly she didn\u2019t want to throw the shower after all. She just wanted to make a spectacle of herself. \n\nShe should thank god either you or your husband continue to speak to her at all, frankly. Plenty of people would not let her around your baby whatsoever since she\u2019s proven she cannot be trusted to keep you and your child safe from these reprehensible people you share DNA with (and their mother / ex wife). \n\nAnd let me take this moment to be extremely clear.\n\nWhat those people did was absolutely reprehensible. Idk why your bio dad\u2019s ex took you\u2014 maybe she thought she could handle it but couldn\u2019t and only realized it too late. But she was a grown woman and actively resented a helpless baby for her adult husband\u2019s transgressions. That\u2019s\u2026 reprehensible. Your half siblings I could be forgiving toward if they made active effort to make amends because they were children and kids often get this weird idea about loyalty in a divorce where they think to be a good kid to mom they need to hate dad (and vice versa). This isn\u2019t helped by parents who get all butt hurt when the kid shows any warm feeling for the other parent or ask to see them or act like going to see the other parent is anything less than complete torture. So if they were affectionate or kind to you, it would be taking dad\u2019s side, disloyal to mom, forgiving dad. It\u2019s a lot easier to hate dad (and by extension you) for fucking up the family than admit how incredibly hurt they were / are by the situation. See if we don\u2019t get good and mad, we might have to deal with how broken we are by these situations. \n\nBut they are grown now and have been for a minute and should have reached out to make amends ages ago, so fuck them and their reprehensible selves too. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, OP. It was wrong what was done to you. So very wrong. And literally none of it is your fault or ever has been.\n\nEdit: NTA", ">Some people will ask me honestly how I could talk like that about my father's ex when she took in the affair baby kept me with my (half) siblings and provided me with a home I wouldn't have otherwise.\n\n\nYou see that type of comment in this sub all the time.", "Just came here to say I come from a great family and I still completely understand - people in completely intact homes can still grow up with zero love or validation, even.

My moms side of the family is large and the women are so gossipy and in peoples business. My dads side is non existent. But it\u2019s like my moms side just talk shit on each other constantly.\n\nI had a second baby after my first and found out after being arrested for drug possession. I was deep in addiction and hadn\u2019t had a period since my first pregnancy so didn\u2019t think much. Anyway they couldn\u2019t let me w/d in jail while pregnant and was taken to the hospital and found out I was 20-21 weeks so nothing could be done. \n\nI ended up giving her up for adoption and don\u2019t regret it for a second but the moment I found out I knew there was no way to keep her. So I \u201cdetached\u201d emotionally. But I was in the hospital for two weeks while they waited as long as possible to induce because my body was not handling it well. Then I spent a month in the hospital critical care step down because my heart and lung issues. I didn\u2019t visit or hold her because I knew she wasn\u2019t \u201cmine\u201d.

Every time they send pics they are doing something new or traveling and she has a huge smile in every single one. \n\nThis is all to say that I\u2019m sorry the adults in your life treated you as \u201cless than\u201d and just a source of extra revenue.

This is entirely up to OP if she wants to invite them to anything or to reach out to them. I agree the SIL should not invite them against OPs wishes. That said, it still could be helpful for OP to meet with someone to get info on medical history etc as that could be important.

I try not to think on it now because it could be very damaging for me.\n\nAs for my half siblings, it would have been easier if they had been younger and maybe I would have some hope that we could have a relationship as all adults. But they were all grown while I was still living in that house and they continued to make their hatred clear. I heard so many awful things from them and looking back I can't imagine carrying that hatred for so many years. They got married and I think some even had kids in that time and they still despised me.\n\nI don't know what I disliked. Hiding in my room from everyone or being totally and completely alone when everyone was out of the house.", "Is the SIL really that clueless when she's been explained it many times and refuses to respect boundaries? At least a clueless innocent person would respect \"Hey I don't want them around because they abused me\"", "I will never understand thinking that's going to be so good for kids. I could see it in circumstances where the person who was cheated on wants that or if they're already in a place where they have a good relationship with the child despite what happened. But that rarely happens and it shouldn't be forced. The kids always suffer for these things being forced.", "*Exactly*. Something isn't adding up, and I don't mean on OP's end, but on SIL's end.

Never feel guilty when someone is this ridiculously rude to you.", "NTA I\u2019m wondering if she\u2019s already been in contact with your family or has some sort of complex where she thinks she can solve any problem and knows best about anything. I\u2019d be tempted to tell her that if she doesn\u2019t drop it she won\u2019t be coming to the shower", "NTA. You have to know that this is all her being kinda nutty and you get to have your boundaries. \n\nYou say your SIL and you are generally close.. is this coming from some sort of trauma in her life? You obviously don't have to, but if you wanted to and thought she could have a reasonable conversation you could maybe ask her why she's thinking and acting this way.. \n\nBut that's a lot of emotional work and you're about to have a baby so definitely a 'only if you're up for it and want to' kind of idea. \n\nCongratulations on your pregnancy. I wish you all the luck in the world.", "Jfc you are the biggest NTA I\u2019ve ever seen!!  I\u2019m so glad your MIL understands- any decent mother (or father) would be heart broken and devastated FOR you and what you\u2019ve endured. You are about to break the cycle and bring a wanted baby into a loving, warm and caring family. If your SIL is so set on being the \u2018hero\u2019 and bringing all your relatives together for some kumbaya moment, she can learn what boundaries mean by not allowing her to meet her niece.  This is the hill to die on - there is no reason to feel bad or guilty; your SIL should be on her knees begging your forgiveness. How \u2018blessed\u2019 she must be to never have experienced such things.  You are NOT the wrong one at all. Don\u2019t apologize and don\u2019t feel guilty. Happy new baby!!", "NTA - your family, your decision.", "Sigh.  I just want to give you a big hug.  And say that I am very happy that you have the family and love that you deserve in your husband and child. All the very very best. \n\nNTA. Do not feel guilty for one millisecond. And honestly, for your own sake, take a break from your SIL. Dealing with her is clearly impacting your mental  and emotional health.", "That would be understandable and forgivable IF she didn't keep pushing despite everyone, including OP, telling her to stop. She doesn't respect OP's boundaries.", "Don\u2019t feel bad. Don\u2019t give her that power. But you might wanna go low to no contact with her yourself. Let hubs deal with his family.", "Good people feel bad, people like your SIL don't feel bad. This was al about an ego boost or hero moment for her.", "They are only going down that way because of your SIL and NOT you.", "Yup that's the plan.\n\n\nSIL knows your history, knows how you feel, doesn't give a crap or is just plain cruel.\n\n\nNow she's making your baby shower all about her wants and needs.\n\n\nDoesn't really sound like someone who really cares much about you.\n\n\nJust because someone wants you to do something that really doesn't concern them, pitches a fit because they don't get their way, doesn't mean you need to do what they want.", "NTA SIL is a major AH and needs to learn boundaries and the word NO....", "She needs to explain why she is trying so hard to hurt you.  Don't entertain the absurd notion that this was meant to help you.", "I promise that the only reasons you are feeling bad are because you\u2019re being gaslight and frankly emotionally abused and re-traumatized by your SIL. \n\nIf I were in your shoes, personally I know that I would go No Contact with SIL immediately.", "You have no reason to feel bad as you are not the cause of how it is going down. \n\nYour SIIL is causing this to be an issue. You've stated clearly your feelings and desires regarding biological \"family\" and your baby shower/life. That, for anyone, should be the end of the discussion. The fact that she continues to try and push some bizarre fantasy narrative about the importance of people who you are biologically related to is 100% her issue.  \n\nNTA", "Thank goodness. Why would anyone think that bringing these people into your life when you are expecting a child is a good thing?!\n\nImagine if they had your contact information and started trying to be a part of your kids life. Heck No!!\n\nSIL needs to mind her own business! Bad decision making on her part.\n\nNTA", "Dear, NTA. There is SERIOUSLY  something wrong with SIL. Given her knowledge of your circumstances growing up, I'm left with the impression she's trying to humiliate and emotionally harm you. Why in the heck would you want anything to do with bio family--they're cruel, heartless and ungodly? \n\nPlease do not question yourself in the least! Some people enjoy drama and get in their own way. It sounds like SIL falls in that category. \n\nEnjoy the shower your MIL sponsors and don't worry about \"sucking up\" to SIL. Let your MIL and husband handle it from hereon out.\n\nBest of luck with motherhood.", "It\u2019s \ud83d\udcaf boundaries. You described it well. I home OP heals and continues to protect herself and I hope her husband understands how awful his sister was to know the background and try to violate those critical boundaries.", ">fantasy fanfic baby shower\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I think the SIL is calculating or dumb. There is really no middle ground here. Could SIL think this is the moment they step up\u2026 maybe for once\u2026 but if they are as horrible as they sound I doubt they will show. The beginning of a life is not a place to fix relationships.This should be a happy stress free moment!", "100% \n\nThis is covertly malicious like SIL wants to see shit stirred up or drama started & for something bad to happen \nto OP. \n\nAbsolutely repulsive. \nStay the hell away from this person.", "Oh shit, she might be doing that to fuck with OP, but why? That\u2019s some very cruel way to mess with someone. Too personal. SIL is a weirdo.", "Or SIL might think this is a television movie where OP will hug her, tears in her eyes, and thank her for creating peace with her family. All that bad stuff is in the past, blah, blah, blah, family is supposed to be united.", "til you can't give awards anymore \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Exactly. And who said that OP wants any information about herself shared with these people? She left for a reason. Either SIL is really stupid or she\u2019s really evil.", "Is it really rejection if she doesn\u2019t want them there?", "Yep - totally NTA - SIL is making it all about her!", "I have a great relationship with my mum and a solid one with my dad (discrepancy is because I have more in common with mum, so we have more bonding time). But I still get that I'm blessed and should take a person's word for it when they say they weren't. It might help that my sister has badly managed bipolar and is someone I often just tolerate because I love my parents and that's what they want.", "Some people find satisfaction in controlling the emotions of others or getting an emotional rise out of others. It\u2019s quite sick.", "This makes sense. I spent most of high school couch surfing and it was real weird to me that my friends and their parents (generally) got along. I can see it going the other way", "There's a couple of ways this could go if they did, none of them good. Like I can easily imagine the fighting and the insults, we've had them on here before.", "That's it right there!  Entertainment!  Clearly, SIL looks down on her and wants her to be miserable.  This is a game to her.", "I\u2019m dying that Opie has already caught on since I first saw it in another post this morning \ud83d\ude02", "Could be both\u2026", "Jesus, if my mil did that, she would *never*. ***NEVER***. see my children again, supervised or not. And you better believe I would be pressing charges.\n\nI am so sorry you had to go through that \ud83d\ude14", "Yep - totally NTA - SIL is making it all about her!", "Yep - totally NTA - SIL is making it all about her!", "The Venn diagram is often a single circle...", "Or they will come and leave gifts of used kitty litter, dog waste, non functional and dirty baby equipment, the most damaged, stained baby clothes they found at Goodwill...no, nothing good will come of this.", "\ud83c\udfb5 Reunited, and it feels so good\n\n\nReunited 'cause we understood\ud83c\udfb6"]}
