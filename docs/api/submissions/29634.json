This is an absolutely never thing for me. I did not invite them to my wedding and I have not seen or spoken to them in several years. But she's going extremely hard on the \"but family\" argument.\n\nBackground: I'm an affair baby. My father cheated on his wife and I was the result. His wife kicked him to the curb and he and my mother stayed together. I was born and they did not take care of me and when I was 3 I was removed from their care by CPS. None of my biological family wanted me.

I'm not sure why. The fact she was paid to take care of me was possibly the reason. I do know is I was not loved. My half siblings ranged from 11 to 17 at the time and they all hated me. It was made perfectly clear to me from a young age that I was never to call her mom and I was never to call them my brothers and sisters. My father's family were still in their lives and knew how I was treated and they wouldn't even report it to my case worker. I mentioned it once or twice but I think she found it easier to dismiss a kids words. My childhood was miserable and I was seen as a burden and as someone who should never have been born. My half siblings continued visiting their mom as adults and all just made it clear they couldn't stand me and were disgusted by my presence. I just left when I was 16 and nobody ever reported me missing or came looking for me.\n\nMy SIL knows my background and she knows that I would never want them in my life again. But push she continues to do and I spoke to my MIL and she tried to take over more but SIL insisted that she had offered first. When she brought it up again I told her to cancel the shower and I would rather have no shower than one thrown by her when she can't respect my boundaries.\n\nMIL stepped in and is now hosting one but SIL is pissed because she had spent a while planning and had paid for some stuff already. MIL said she'd give her the money back but she said I was in the wrong and I should appreciate her for wanting to \"give me back my family\". I told her I had no family until I met them and she needs to accept that my blood relatives do not want me and I do not want them.\n\nI know she keeps telling my husband how wrong I was and he keeps defending me but I feel bad about the tension now.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698237592, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17g3thm/aita_for_telling_my_sil_she_should_cancel_the/", "score": 13, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
