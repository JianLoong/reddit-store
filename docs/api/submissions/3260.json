It was silly stuff at first. How we squeezed toothpaste, which direction the toilet paper roll should face, that sort of thing.  But as our relationship progressed we talked about more serious stuff.  How we would discipline our children, living wills, and what we would do if we knew we were having a child with severe special needs.  We decided together that we didn't want to do that to a human.  To bring them into the world to suffer.  We were lucky enough that it wasn't ever something we had to deal with.\n\nI had told my sister this because she is my best friend.  She went running to our parents saying that we were terrible people who would terminate a pregnancy that wasn't going to give us a perfect  child.  I never said that. We had to spend days explaining that we knew what we could handle and what we could deal with.  My parents weren't happy. \n\nWell, unfortunately, my sister 36 did not have this talk with her husband.  When she was pregnant with their second child the doctor told them that the child would have many health issues. They prayed about it and went forward with the pregnancy.  \n\nMy niece is nine now. And my sister now has an ex-husband.  The medical expenses drained all their savings. And he could not handle knowing that caring for his daughter was going to be something he had to do for the rest of her life.  \n\nWe just had Thanksgiving and my sister is having a tough time.  My niece is in diapers and will be for the rest of her life. My sister can't work because she would need special child care. No day care would do.  Prescriptions are hundreds if not thousands every month.  My parents are helping her but my dad has had to postpone his retirement to be able to give her money.  My wife and I help with about $500 a month.  It's not much but it still puts a hole in our budget.  \n\nMy sister wants to move in with me so my wife, who works from home, and my MIL who lives with us to help with our children, can help her with my niece.  We don't have room for three more people.  Or the budget to make out house accessible. So I told her that we are not responsible for her life choices. \n\nMy parents are saying that I need to step up and help.  Or that they will give everything to my sister when they pass away \n\nI told them that this was a great idea.  My family doesn't want or need their money and that they should set up a trust for her now.  \n\nI guess that wasn't the answer they wanted because everyone in the family is calling me an asshole for not taking care of my sister and niece.  \n\nSo I guess I'm asking if I'm the asshole for not wanting to be in a situation I intentionally avoided.\n\nEdit\n\nHey. Thank you all for helping me get an outside.view.  \n\nHere are answers to the most common questions.  \n\n1. My ex-BIL pays child support and spousal support.  And he spends a lot of time with my nephew, my sister's other child.\n\n2. She can't move on with my parents because they downsized as soon as we were out of the house.  \n\n3. It was a religious thing.  Her, her ex, and my parents are very religious. I used to be.  \n\n4. She is already receiving assistance from the government.  \n\n5. This one is painful to write.  Without going into details let me just say this, I'm relieved that my niece has so little brain activity that she can't actually be experiencing all the pain her poor little body is undergoing.", "created_utc": 1669453957, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z534g7/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_my_special_needs/", "score": 11665, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are being more generous than many other siblings would be.\n\nSometimes people who are in very difficult situations become selfish and entitled. It sounds as if your sister has this problem.  Her burden is so great that she cannot imagine why others don\u2019t give her more help.  \n\nShe has no right to expect you and your wife (and mother-in-law) to take care of her and her children. You have children of your own.  Your wife is trying to work from home. How is that going to work out?\n\nThe situation is an invitation for disaster.  I bet if she moved in she would lean more and more on your wife and her mother.  It  would definitely not be fair to them.  Your children would be uncomfortable. The whole household would be revolving around your niece\u2019s problem.  It would not be surprising if it took a toll on your marriage.\n\nIf your sister can\u2019t handle caring for the poor child on her own, then she should look into residential care.

If they are going to constantly try to twist your arm and pressure you into making your whole family's lives revolve around your sister and her niece then you will stop giving what you are and make a clean cut as it's just too much to be sacrificing already while being given the middle finger and a sneer for not sacrificing *everything*.

There really shouldn\u2019t be much medical costs. (I used to do customer service for Medicare) there\u2019s also lots of assistance out there for her to use instead of solely relying on her family..", "NTA.

If you don't want them, don't force people to take care of them.", "NTA, and why would your family even think it's okay to ask your MIL to help with your niece? If your parents are so concerned about it, shouldn't they be helping instead? They are the niece's grandparents,  not MIL.", "NTA.

Your niece is not your responsibility, and nobody should be putting pressure on you to share/adapt your home.\n\nYou seem to place a lot of blame on your sister for the situation she is in and very little on her ex-husband. They created this child together, seemingly decided to keep the child together, yet he has fled. I hope he is paying child support at the very least. Two people created this situation, but it sounds like only one of them is doing the work for it.

I chose to have a child.\n\nThat said America sucks big time! If you can, help your sister immigrate to Europe or another country with a good social services network. If I wasn't living in Europe the only way I would have been able to take care of my child was by prostituting myself ( I'm being serious here).This will be helpful for your niece as well because very likely if everything goes well your sister is going to die before her and being in a country that will take care of her is good.", "NTA for your specific question. You already provide a lot - it\u2019s wonderful that you contribute $500 a month and suggested the trust. And the expectation that your wife could care for your niece while working from home, or that your MIL who has nothing to do with her could, is outrageous.\n\nBut there are some really awful ableist moments in your post and I think you should reflect on them. You didn\u2019t need any of the background of your decisions or telling your sister for the AITA question to be asked. She\u2019s out of line regardless.", "ESH\n\n\nYou shouldn't have phrased it as a life choice, but NTA FOR EVERYTHING ELSE\n\n\nYour sister because what she wants is such a huge ask.

It's not fair to your kids.\n\n\nYour parents because they are essentially saying that she and her daughter are your responsibility now.

My SIL has spent her entire life taking care of her.\n\nI have told my husband that his sister needs to be making arrangements for her because his sister is getting older and isn't going to live forever. I have told him that I. Can. Not. Do. It. He agrees that we can't take care of her, and that his sister and her ex husband need to figure something out.\n\nSo LW, this kid, through ZERO fault of her own,  has already cost your sister her marriage...don't let your family with their ridiculous expectations cost you yours too! They have a lot of nerve expecting your WIFE's mom to take care of HER kid.  Also your wife works from home, that's not code for \"does nothing all day.\"", "Seriously how is she spending so much on medications when Medicaid is available for these situations? It makes no sense.", "Yeahhhh, this is federally mandated so mom could be paid as caregiver in every state.", "Please, everyone have this discussion with your spouse before you get married. I did this and we were both in agreement to abort if our baby had any life threatening birth defects.", "I think she is getting help from the government like I said.  But she is still getting worn out.", "This. I don't think people realize how lacking residential services for youth are, especially if she needs nursing level care. The best she can do is get on a waiver that covers the majority of support services, and get her into a day program/school while she works. Doctors will postpone puberty to keep kids small enough for parents to care for on their own because there's nowhere for them to go until they're 18.\n\nIt's sad all around but I absolutely wouldn't sign away parental rights and make the child a ward of the state. I've seen way too many people die and experience terrible abuses simply because they have nobody to advocate for them. Signing away rights means the parent loses all ability to advocate for care, it would be much better to retain guardianship and go through the process to continue it into adulthood, and move her to out of home care when she's grown. Simply abandoning her, even if she wants to visit, is likely to land her in an ill equipped foster care home where God knows what will happen to her.", "Nope, I have a special needs brother and live in texas. Unfortunately parents aren\u2019t allowed to get paid, only the siblings can.", "It really is sad. There\u2019s very very few areas for ID/MH medically needy children. Most of them that come into my services were in foster care or adopted then when they became too difficult were placed in a residential setting. We have some great families and some not so great uninvolved families. It\u2019s a hard decision and a difficult job for 1 person to do all care. I feel for the mom, but definitely would push for a waiver to at least obtain paid help to support the child. Burnout and caregiver fatigue is very real and can lead to abuse.", "Yeah that couldn't be more accurate here, considering OP didn't even mention him at first. The poor kid is not only being neglected but also has to live in that environment of constant stress and poverty on top of it. Soon, if not already, he'll resent his sister for destroying their family, through no fault of her own. I hope he can get some form of counseling, either professionally or at school, because that's such a horrible childhood experience", "Greetings from another Special Needs Momma. And you are 100000% right. Most Special Needs Parents don't expect others to take on our children.", "Absolutely. Out of home care probably isn't an option but I don't understand why she isn't in school (I thought it was required to provide all children with the opportunity for public school regardless of profound disability?) or a day program, she should qualify for Medicaid if her mom is struggling because the limits are much higher for disabled children, and she should at minimum be entitled to respite services under OPWDD waivers. Either the care manager is a picture of a social worker glued to a cardboard box or this mother has been refusing every service offered to her. Having a child with profound disabilities is a very difficult thing to deal with and it will eat away at your money but in most of the US day services and medical assistance is fairly well funded. \n\nGranted I do primarily work with children who have mental illnesses so coming from that system, everything looks well funded. But there are multiple services provided by multiple agencies for people with profound disabilities including children within walking distance from my home.", "No, we\u2019re not. Get over yourself and your bandwagon.", "It\u2019s interesting that the Taliban in Afghanistan also won\u2019t allow women to be educated. Fundamentalism in religion is predicated on using women only as breeding stock. Can\u2019t educate them or the whole system falls apart.", "And it gets harder every year. Carrying a 9 year old might still be possible but the puberty growth spurt will come soon enough. Then she will start her period too which is another difficult thing to handle for the carers.", "I'm in a similar situation with my parents and brother and truly, until i saw stuff like this online I thought it was totally normal that I was assumed to be giving my life up to look after my brother when my parents died. Like there was never even a discussion about my feelings or wishes on it, and I felt like a terrible person for not wanting to do it. Now I know it's a form of abuse", "Well you mentioned the cost of prescriptions and childcare.  My point is that there are a lot of resources available to your sister and no one should expect you to take on this responsibility.", "SN parent here: we would never try to foist our son onto anyone nor do they bear any responsibility for him. If someone wants to help, awesome. The sister is out of her mind thinking OP or OP\u2019s MIL should be expected to shoulder this. \nPraying for your niece.", "Of course our state has shit like this as law.  Another reason the abortion laws are exceptionally cruel, if a mother is forced to keep her permanently disabled child there's no way she could afford to take care of it. SMH", "I\u2019m a special needs mama too! I have to say that I NEVER expect help from my family members except for the biological father of my special needs son. He decided he couldn\u2019t handle a baby who would never be healthy (we had no idea our baby would have so many health problems\u2026it happened because he was born a micro-preemie). My parents have offered me help because they don\u2019t want to see me suffer or my son suffer, but I NEVER demanded the help and I certainly never expected the help. \n\nOP, NTA. It sounds like you and your wife already are doing a lot for your sister and your niece. Your sister has some very skewed expectations of what you and your wife should be doing for her.", "unfortunately this is where I'm at with my family, dad has terminal cancer, mum is also old and frail. I've basically been told either i become a live in carer for my brother or I get cut out of the 7 figure will. The kicker is I'm also disabled, though it didn't happen til adulthood. I live in poverty with significant health struggles that would make me totally unsuitable for this role but dad's attitude is that he had to give up his life for my brother, he didn't get to choose so neither do i", "It really is! Especially since it's something he doesn't have to do but is choosing to do to help make his sister/nieces life a little easier....", "If she is in such poor condition, why is she not in a permanent care facility instead of at home?", "Please have your sister check into In Home Care or In Home Support Services through the county. She may qualify to hire someone and also get paid for caring for the child.", "New level of entitlement.", "I wonder why you are sitting on your sleeping wife at 6:24", "I think she gets that. But she is still wearing out.", "The real asshole is also the sister, who had a fetus diagnosed prenatally with serious anomalies, and made a decision to finish the pregnancy and become the mother of a catastrophically disabled child. There\u2019s no backsies when you decide it\u2019s too hard later down the line. I\u2019m sure the neonatologists spared no details telling her what her child would suffer, what their life would be like and what her life as caregiver would become. I\u2019m sure they steered her toward abortion, for the fetus\u2019s sake and hers, and if she was religious as OP says, she refused to consider it properly. Now a child suffers because of her hubris in deciding what God believed, and so she suffers alongside her child. It\u2019s a hard life, harder than anyone who hasn\u2019t lived it will ever know, but people like her who choose that life and cry about their burden really piss me off. Like most of the other parents I know, we had no warnings about our disabled kids. We accepted what we got, and learned to live with it, and none of us had relatives giving us $500 from this one, and at least that much from another one. There were a few that offered through the years, but it was always people who were struggling themselves, and we refused to take their money. We\u2019re not making things harder on someone we love just so they can make it easier on us. If I were the sister, I\u2019d never take money from OP and leave him scrambling to pay his bills every month. \n\nOP is NTA, but is sister wears the crown. His parents are the runners up.", "Well double check because it\u2019s different then SSI which she should also be getting for her daughter and if there is Medi-cal or Medi-caid it should cover most of her expenses. If she does in fact get  IHSS through the county then she can hire someone to help her. Check into the local regional center and see if they can provide respite care for niece while Sis goes and takes a break or works.", "If your sister is unable to work, please have her apply for SSI (federally funded Medicaid through the Social Security Administration.) They can do the most help here. Alabama has AWFUL Medicaid laws - take this from someone who worked Medicaid eligibility for people like your sister, but in Texas. Please send me a message if you need any help! I will answer any questions I can!", "Those are very valid reasons and the same I have. I never want kids. Neither does my partner. We would abort a healthy baby, let alone one with special needs. We only live once, for a very short time and to spend the literal best years of your life caring for someone who will never be able to care for themselves, who eats up all of your emotional and physical well being, while also eating up all financial resources. Absolutely not. I would for sure end up killing my self or just going out for milk and never coming back. Life\u2019s not meant to be lived like that.", "They can be, I know some people at had a child with mutation that first appeared in the child, not something heritable like Tay Sachs.  It did not show up on NIPT not ultrasound.  Their child didn't start showing abnormalities until a few months after birth and did not get a diagnosis until sequencing work.  Their child is profoundly intellectually and physically disabled and will be for life.\n\nOn the less severe side I also know a child with a different mutation who is midly disabled but faces an increased risk of premature death.", "I was a special needs child (born a micro preemie with lots of medical issue) and my older sister hated me in our younger years for this... Story goes she even sat there kinking my oxygen cord one day when she was like 4 or 5 years old...We get along great now as adults but yes she hated me...", "I once witnessed a child talking to his mother just after his older and disabled sibling died: mommy, will you love me now that my sister is dead?  It said it all.....", "Republicans don\u2019t believe in government handouts.", "Or it could be there are no facilities hi former caseworker with a disabled person within my family as well. Also, the cost of said facilities here in the states is nuts cost wise and you have to tap out ALL resources in order to get any public assistance to help very few facilities take Medicaid/Medicare and those that do are generally awful", "I am also Christian, and I strongly believe that God would rather welcome a child into his Kingdom, where there is no suffering or pain, instead of the child being born into a life of pain just so they existed.", "Exactly so. It is monstrous.  Playing with lives so they can stay in power.", "Many care homes are not great. Often understaffed by people who are not paid very well for the difficult work they do every day. Often families prefer to keep their child at home and oversee the care they receive.", "I think the videos of you guys spray painting your grass green is a pretty great analogy..."]}
