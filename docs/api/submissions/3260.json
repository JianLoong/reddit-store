It was silly stuff at first. How we squeezed toothpaste, which direction the toilet paper roll should face, that sort of thing.  But as our relationship progressed we talked about more serious stuff.  How we would discipline our children, living wills, and what we would do if we knew we were having a child with severe special needs.  We decided together that we didn't want to do that to a human.  To bring them into the world to suffer.  We were lucky enough that it wasn't ever something we had to deal with.\n\nI had told my sister this because she is my best friend.  She went running to our parents saying that we were terrible people who would terminate a pregnancy that wasn't going to give us a perfect  child.  I never said that. We had to spend days explaining that we knew what we could handle and what we could deal with.  My parents weren't happy. \n\nWell, unfortunately, my sister 36 did not have this talk with her husband.  When she was pregnant with their second child the doctor told them that the child would have many health issues. They prayed about it and went forward with the pregnancy.  \n\nMy niece is nine now. And my sister now has an ex-husband.  The medical expenses drained all their savings. And he could not handle knowing that caring for his daughter was going to be something he had to do for the rest of her life.  \n\nWe just had Thanksgiving and my sister is having a tough time.  My niece is in diapers and will be for the rest of her life. My sister can't work because she would need special child care. No day care would do.  Prescriptions are hundreds if not thousands every month.  My parents are helping her but my dad has had to postpone his retirement to be able to give her money.  My wife and I help with about $500 a month.  It's not much but it still puts a hole in our budget.  \n\nMy sister wants to move in with me so my wife, who works from home, and my MIL who lives with us to help with our children, can help her with my niece.  We don't have room for three more people.  Or the budget to make out house accessible. So I told her that we are not responsible for her life choices. \n\nMy parents are saying that I need to step up and help.  Or that they will give everything to my sister when they pass away \n\nI told them that this was a great idea.  My family doesn't want or need their money and that they should set up a trust for her now.  \n\nI guess that wasn't the answer they wanted because everyone in the family is calling me an asshole for not taking care of my sister and niece.  \n\nSo I guess I'm asking if I'm the asshole for not wanting to be in a situation I intentionally avoided.", "created_utc": 1669453957, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z534g7/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_my_special_needs/", "score": 804, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like ... WTF!?! \n\nYour entire household would revolve around your special needs niece, with your family's needs being secondary, because everyone else in the house can function independently. That would be very destructive to your family. \n\nIf everyone else in the family thinks it's such a terrific idea to have your sister and her daughter move in with another family member and expect everyone in the household to help care for the daughter, why aren't they stepping up and offering to do what they expect of you?", "NTA, you have a family to protect and take care of. Kudos to you for giving her money every month, because you're not required to.", "NTA-I was a special needs child as was one of my sisters. Children aren\u2019t exactly easy to raise already.

You are being more generous than many other siblings would be.\n\nSometimes people who are in very difficult situations become selfish and entitled. It sounds as if your sister has this problem.  Her burden is so great that she cannot imagine why others don\u2019t give her more help.  \n\nShe has no right to expect you and your wife (and mother-in-law) to take care of her and her children. You have children of your own.  Your wife is trying to work from home. How is that going to work out?\n\nThe situation is an invitation for disaster.  I bet if she moved in she would lean more and more on your wife and her mother.  It  would definitely not be fair to them.  Your children would be uncomfortable. The whole household would be revolving around your niece\u2019s problem.  It would not be surprising if it took a toll on your marriage.\n\nIf your sister can\u2019t handle caring for the poor child on her own, then she should look into residential care. It strikes me that your sister is not thinking longterm but is just trying to get from day to day.  The solution of moving in with your family may sound great to her but it is not realistic.  \n\n(Edited to clarify what I was trying to say.)", "NTA.  You don't have the room.

But you are not obligated and have enough on your plate with your own house, work and children. And you already give her money, you can barely spare.", "NTA I'd tell them that they are demanding far too much from you and your family and that what you are giving now is already affecting your budget and what you can do in life. If they are going to constantly try to twist your arm and pressure you into making your whole family's lives revolve around your sister and her niece then you will stop giving what you are and make a clean cut as it's just too much to be sacrificing already while being given the middle finger and a sneer for not sacrificing *everything*. They can then make up the deficit -- alternatively, they can pull their heads all the way in and appreciate that you are already doing your bit.", "Raising a profoundly disabled child is tough on parents and tough on marriages.

She chose to go against medical advice regarding her pregnancy and brought that baby into this. \n\nAs far as medical expenses, If you\u2019re in the US, that child should have Medicare since they are disabled & Medicaid. There really shouldn\u2019t be much medical costs. (I used to do customer service for Medicare) there\u2019s also lots of assistance out there for her to use instead of solely relying on her family..", "NTA. Shit like this is how you get kids who are treated like garbage. Some people want kids, some people don't want kids. If you don't want them, don't force people to take care of them.", "NTA, and why would your family even think it's okay to ask your MIL to help with your niece? If your parents are so concerned about it, shouldn't they be helping instead? They are the niece's grandparents,  not MIL.", "NTA.

Your niece is not your responsibility, and nobody should be putting pressure on you to share/adapt your home.\n\nYou seem to place a lot of blame on your sister for the situation she is in and very little on her ex-husband. They created this child together, seemingly decided to keep the child together, yet he has fled. I hope he is paying child support at the very least. Two people created this situation, but it sounds like only one of them is doing the work for it. It is not your responsibility to make up for the ex-husband's shortcomings.", "OP as a mother of a child with additional needs who will likely need lifelong care you are NTA. My child is my responsibility and even though I have wonderful siblings I have only asked them to care for my child on 6 occasions in 5 years. These were all only about 2 hours max. I chose to have a child.\n\nThat said America sucks big time! If you can, help your sister immigrate to Europe or another country with a good social services network. If I wasn't living in Europe the only way I would have been able to take care of my child was by prostituting myself ( I'm being serious here).This will be helpful for your niece as well because very likely if everything goes well your sister is going to die before her and being in a country that will take care of her is good.", "NTA for your specific question. You already provide a lot - it\u2019s wonderful that you contribute $500 a month and suggested the trust. And the expectation that your wife could care for your niece while working from home, or that your MIL who has nothing to do with her could, is outrageous.\n\nBut there are some really awful ableist moments in your post and I think you should reflect on them. You didn\u2019t need any of the background of your decisions or telling your sister for the AITA question to be asked. She\u2019s out of line regardless.", "ESH\n\n\nYou shouldn't have phrased it as a life choice, but NTA FOR EVERYTHING ELSE\n\n\nYour sister because what she wants is such a huge ask.  She sounds like she feels she is entitled to reap the benefits of your family (house, childcare, probably no rent).  \n\n\n It's an awful situation but you don't have the room, and she expects your wife and MIL to take her of her child in addition to your own.  It's not fair to your kids.\n\n\nYour parents because they are essentially saying that she and her daughter are your responsibility now.

Are there some people who are justified in saying she should never have been born into this family? I'd say yes. Any child is a major responsibility, and parenting is a lifelong job.

I've seen so many parents claim that they were caring for their child equally and then when we actually crunch the numbers and look into not only who is taking the child to and from appointments, but who is booking those appointments, who is keeping track of them, etc. The mental load of having a child with serious disabilities is pretty intense. For many parents it's at least another part-time job on top of their already existing jobs. This country does not provide anywhere near enough support and care for families who have kids with disabilities, and it definitely places the burden on moms. I don't even know if I could begin to count how many families I worked with where they had a disabled child and the father disappeared without paying child support or providing any practical support.\n\nI'm sure we could both go even further into this but honestly it's one of the more heartbreaking parts of my job.", "I know two guys with kids who owe child supports. They don't pay their child supports. It's been decades. The \"kids\" are adults now. The bio-dads work under the table or don't work at all and depend on their new baby mamas to support them. The new baby mamas don't claim them for tax reasons, even if they're supporting the deadbeats.", "Women are also socialized to be nurturers, so if they \"give up\" they're often taught that they're failures.", ">\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to do that to a human\u201d\n\nBecause as some disabilities are not life changing other make the disabled person struggle and suffer for their entire life.\n\n>\u201cWe were lucky\u201d\n\nDo you realize that people with more \"advanced\" disabilities need 24h care? It's too much for some people to manage.\n\n>\u201cher life choices\u201d\n\nIt is a life choice\n\n>\u201cconsequences of her choices\u201d\n\nIt was her life choice. Choice that completely changed OPs sisters life standards.", "Doctor do suggest/allows to terminate a pregnancy when the quality of life of the child is going to be very low, not in any disability case. So this is doing something to a human and it is a choice.\n\n\u201cWe were lucky\u201d unfortunately in a place where you have to pay to cure your child, you are lucky when they do not have health issue. We can all agree that it is not fair, but we have to admit that unfortunately that this is the truth.\n\nThe base of a couple should be communication, as people have to talk about what to do in case of unexpected pregnancy, so they should speak about rare health condition of the child.", "[removed]", "Truth", "I actually read about mothers in Venezuela surrendering their babies to the state orphanages because they couldn\u2019t afford to feed them.", "Tell me about it!", "Visiting daily is possible & she can monitor her daughter - whereas continuing to flush money down the toilet for a temporary solution is not.  \n\nOP\u2019s mom & dad could literally give her every cent to their name & be forced to eat cat food when the social security checks ran out each month & EVEN THEN the money wouldn\u2019t be enough.  And SIL cannot work caring for her full time personally.   \n\nThe worst thing the parent of a seriously disabled child can do is put off the inevitable because they don\u2019t want to face reality.  The girl is almost too big for the mother to lift now (& therefore it is safe to assume almost too big for the grandparents to lift as well).  And realistically, the mother could have an accident & fall over dead tomorrow - yet she foolishly has no one lined up to take over primary caregiving for her daughter.  \n\nIf mother puts her in a state facility now, mother is still able-bodied enough to monitor how often the change/bath her & raise all sorts of hell (& even do some of it herself if needed).  She could also make the girls transition from home care into the facility less traumatic overall.  \n\nThe mother waiting for some miracle to happen where she doesn\u2019t have to face that reality is harming the child more than anyone.", "Exactly right. They keep caring well beyond what is reasonable from the outside of the parent/child relationship and have a mentality that nobody can care for their child better than they can. The mother of the child who was left brain dead after a tonsillectomy had complications and the mother of Terry Schiavo both come to mind as very public examples of hope beyond all reason.", "Bot", "Competing with Venezuela really isn't the defense you think it is.", "Log off and stop looking for arguments where they don't exist"]}
