It was silly stuff at first. How we squeezed toothpaste, which direction the toilet paper roll should face, that sort of thing.  But as our relationship progressed we talked about more serious stuff.  How we would discipline our children, living wills, and what we would do if we knew we were having a child with severe special needs.  We decided together that we didn't want to do that to a human.  To bring them into the world to suffer.  We were lucky enough that it wasn't ever something we had to deal with.\n\nI had told my sister this because she is my best friend.  She went running to our parents saying that we were terrible people who would terminate a pregnancy that wasn't going to give us a perfect  child.  I never said that. We had to spend days explaining that we knew what we could handle and what we could deal with.  My parents weren't happy. \n\nWell, unfortunately, my sister 36 did not have this talk with her husband.  When she was pregnant with their second child the doctor told them that the child would have many health issues. They prayed about it and went forward with the pregnancy.  \n\nMy niece is nine now. And my sister now has an ex-husband.  The medical expenses drained all their savings. And he could not handle knowing that caring for his daughter was going to be something he had to do for the rest of her life.  \n\nWe just had Thanksgiving and my sister is having a tough time.  My niece is in diapers and will be for the rest of her life. My sister can't work because she would need special child care. No day care would do.  Prescriptions are hundreds if not thousands every month.  My parents are helping her but my dad has had to postpone his retirement to be able to give her money.  My wife and I help with about $500 a month.  It's not much but it still puts a hole in our budget.  \n\nMy sister wants to move in with me so my wife, who works from home, and my MIL who lives with us to help with our children, can help her with my niece.  We don't have room for three more people.  Or the budget to make out house accessible. So I told her that we are not responsible for her life choices. \n\nMy parents are saying that I need to step up and help.  Or that they will give everything to my sister when they pass away \n\nI told them that this was a great idea.  My family doesn't want or need their money and that they should set up a trust for her now.  \n\nI guess that wasn't the answer they wanted because everyone in the family is calling me an asshole for not taking care of my sister and niece.  \n\nSo I guess I'm asking if I'm the asshole for not wanting to be in a situation I intentionally avoided.", "created_utc": 1669453957, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z534g7/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_my_special_needs/", "score": 123, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your niece isn't your responsibility. Your sister needs to talk to get your niece on disability if she hasn't done so and look into group homes. This little girl is going to be too big to lift without help in a few years. Probably the best you can do is to try and help look for resources that will make her life easier.", "NTA. Expectations are too high. Am I reading this right that she thinks your mother-in-law would provide care for your niece (a child who has no relation to her)?", "You are not the arsehole. They want you to do it so they don't have to.\n\nIs there no state welfare to hp out with this BTW?", "Nta\n\nTurn it around and try to convince your parents that signing over their house now would be more beneficial. Throw it all back in their faces", "NTA.\n\nIt's unreasonable to ask that you take two additional people into your home, that your WFH wife provide personal care *while she's supposed to be doing the job she's being paid to do*, and that your MIL can take in caring for her child in addition to your own children. Like ... WTF!?! \n\nYour entire household would revolve around your special needs niece, with your family's needs being secondary, because everyone else in the house can function independently. That would be very destructive to your family. \n\nIf everyone else in the family thinks it's such a terrific idea to have your sister and her daughter move in with another family member and expect everyone in the household to help care for the daughter, why aren't they stepping up and offering to do what they expect of you?", "NTA, you have a family to protect and take care of. Kudos to you for giving her money every month, because you're not required to.", "NTA-I was a special needs child as was one of my sisters. Children aren\u2019t exactly easy to raise already. Adding to it by taking on a special needs child is not something everyone can do. You aren\u2019t an asshole for knowing your boundaries.", "This is my biggest fear, raising a disabled child would ruin my life. I\u2019m not embarrassed to admit that. I don\u2019t feel shame for that. NTA. You already provide money, which I would never do. You made a choice to not disrupt your life with YOUR OWN children, so why would you do that for someone else?", "NTA. It\u2019s not your responsibility to house and shelter your sister and niece. The $500 a month is generous enough and more than most people could (or would) put forth.", "NTA you've already done way more than I'm willing to", "NTA\n\nYou and your wife are already going above and beyond by giving your sister the $500 a month. Your sister (and others) are wanting/expecting way too much to even ask to move in and trying to put some of the care onto your wife and MIL.", "NTA to be honest...there's nothing else you can do.", "NTA you\u2019re only really responsible for you and your direct family, like you say it\u2019s your sister\u2019s responsibility for her child.\n\nAlso your sister expects your wife\u2019s mother to help care for her child? Even though that child isn\u2019t related to your MIL?", "NTA- Your sister\u2019s situation is sad, but you have no obligation to do more than you are doing.  You are being more generous than many other siblings would be.\n\nSometimes people who are in very difficult situations become selfish and entitled. It sounds as if your sister has this problem.  Her burden is so great that she cannot imagine why others don\u2019t give her more help.  \n\nShe has no right to expect you and your wife (and mother-in-law) to take care of her and her children. You have children of your own.  Your wife is trying to work from home. How is that going to work out?\n\nThe situation is an invitation for disaster.  I bet if she moved in she would lean more and more on your wife and her mother.  It  would definitely not be fair to them.  Your children would be uncomfortable. The whole household would be revolving around your niece\u2019s problem.  It would not be surprising if it took a toll on your marriage.\n\nIf your sister can\u2019t handle caring for the poor child on her own, then she should look into residential care. It strikes me that your sister is not thinking longterm but is just trying to get from day to day.  The solution of moving in with your family may sound great to her but it is not realistic.  \n\n(Edited to clarify what I was trying to say.)", "NTA.  You don't have the room. You don't have the energy. And why do they think, that your MIL will help out in this scenario? More likely she will just say \"bye\" and you will be out of her help.\n\nI feel for your sister, that is rough and it would be nice, if you could give her, say, a day off once a month. But you are not obligated and have enough on your plate with your own house, work and children. And you already give her money, you can barely spare.", "NTA I'd tell them that they are demanding far too much from you and your family and that what you are giving now is already affecting your budget and what you can do in life. If they are going to constantly try to twist your arm and pressure you into making your whole family's lives revolve around your sister and her niece then you will stop giving what you are and make a clean cut as it's just too much to be sacrificing already while being given the middle finger and a sneer for not sacrificing *everything*. They can then make up the deficit -- alternatively, they can pull their heads all the way in and appreciate that you are already doing your bit.", "Raising a profoundly disabled child is tough on parents and tough on marriages. You are already providing financial support. Where is the ex in all this? He should be paying child support and helping provide care. Why would sister expect your MIL to help raise her child? Why doesn\u2019t she move in with your parents so your mom can help care for her? If they already live with your parents, why isn\u2019t mom stepping up? You and your wife are being very generous in giving her $500 every month. NTA.", "Nta. And your wive WORKS ftom home, which means she would essentially have to give up her job? Because you can\u2019t work and take care of a special needs child at the same time.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your responsibility. She chose to go against medical advice regarding her pregnancy and brought that baby into this. \n\nAs far as medical expenses, If you\u2019re in the US, that child should have Medicare since they are disabled & Medicaid. There really shouldn\u2019t be much medical costs. (I used to do customer service for Medicare) there\u2019s also lots of assistance out there for her to use instead of solely relying on her family..", "NTA. Shit like this is how you get kids who are treated like garbage. Some people want kids, some people don't want kids. If you don't want them, don't force people to take care of them.", "NTA, and why would your family even think it's okay to ask your MIL to help with your niece? If your parents are so concerned about it, shouldn't they be helping instead? They are the niece's grandparents,  not MIL.", "NTA. What an absurd expectation.\n\nIf $500 is impacting your budget \u2014 stop doing it. If her expenses are piling up, you\u2019re losing far more than she\u2019s gaining.", "NTA for your title question. Your niece is not your responsibility, and nobody should be putting pressure on you to share/adapt your home.\n\nYou seem to place a lot of blame on your sister for the situation she is in and very little on her ex-husband. They created this child together, seemingly decided to keep the child together, yet he has fled. I hope he is paying child support at the very least. Two people created this situation, but it sounds like only one of them is doing the work for it. It is not your responsibility to make up for the ex-husband's shortcomings.", "OP as a mother of a child with additional needs who will likely need lifelong care you are NTA. My child is my responsibility and even though I have wonderful siblings I have only asked them to care for my child on 6 occasions in 5 years. These were all only about 2 hours max. I chose to have a child.\n\nThat said America sucks big time! If you can, help your sister immigrate to Europe or another country with a good social services network. If I wasn't living in Europe the only way I would have been able to take care of my child was by prostituting myself ( I'm being serious here).This will be helpful for your niece as well because very likely if everything goes well your sister is going to die before her and being in a country that will take care of her is good.", "NTA for your specific question. You already provide a lot - it\u2019s wonderful that you contribute $500 a month and suggested the trust. And the expectation that your wife could care for your niece while working from home, or that your MIL who has nothing to do with her could, is outrageous.\n\nBut there are some really awful ableist moments in your post and I think you should reflect on them.", "ESH\n\n\nYou shouldn't have phrased it as a life choice, but NTA FOR EVERYTHING ELSE\n\n\nYour sister because what she wants is such a huge ask.  She sounds like she feels she is entitled to reap the benefits of your family (house, childcare, probably no rent).  \n\n\n It's an awful situation but you don't have the room, and she expects your wife and MIL to take her of her child in addition to your own.  It's not fair to your kids.\n\n\nYour parents because they are essentially saying that she and her daughter are your responsibility now.  Of course they didn't like it when you agreed to be taken out of the will, if they did that, then they have to take care of things.\n\n\nYour sister needs to figure out her options with government programs etc.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The fact that you are financially helping is amazing. If they really want to help then your sister and niece can go and live with them. Your wife working from home means that your home is her office, so she won't really be able to help her anyway. How does her ex husband support her (financial, rest by...)? Are there any charities that could help? Maybe worth exploring...", "NTA. You are paying hundreds a month just to subsidize your sister. She knew the risks of going forward with her pregnancy, did it, and is demanding assistance from everybody else. Your parents kinda deserve it given their perspective, but you sure don't.\n\nYour idea about a trust is probably the best solution here.

Nor can we always prepare ourselves for scenarios in life. \n\nHowever, you have a family and a life.

You did the mature thing and talked it out with your partner BEFORE this became a reality you had to face. You are now living with the consequences of those decisions, and they are agreeable to you. Your sister did the opposite and is also now living with the consequences of her decisions. Does my heart break for your niece? Are there some people who are justified in saying she should never have been born into this family? I'd say yes. Any child is a major responsibility, and parenting is a lifelong job. If you're not up the task, why take it on? That is basically child abuse. Some families are ready and willing to have a special needs child, just like some families are ready and willing to have multiples, large numbers of kids, etc. More power to them. Your sister is not one of these people, but that's her business, not yours. You already give her an amount of money that is significant to you, even though it is not required. Your wife and MIL are not required to chip in with time and effort. Your parents' solution, though spiteful, is the best one. Tell her not to plead \"family\". Tell her to give YOU $500 then, since you're also her family, and you have kids.", "We are all over that. But there are still a lot of expenses that need to be paid.", "Yes.

I know a lot of parents of disabled children including myself and in 90% of the cases the dads have moved on and rarely pay child support. Going after them requires so much money and effort that mums don't have because they are busy taking care of the child.

At that point, the state must pay for 100% of her care.  And your sister could visit her as often as she liked.  That\u2019s the solution many have to resort to to avoid literal lifelong poverty.

Who is she to them??", "OP, I know CA is expensive in some areas, but their state disability is really good.  Because your niece needs full time care, the state would pay your sister to be her caretaker.  Assuming your sister wouldn\u2019t move to a HCOL area what the state pays could really go far. Plus respite hours so she can have a break too.  \nMy old neighbor took her sister in when their mom died, and she\u2019s getting a comparable salary to her previous job. Granted this one is MUCH more work and stress. \n\nYou are NTA for not helping more than you already are.\n\nETA- not suggesting your sister move potentially across the country, but maybe other states near by have social programs like this to help.", "Exactly. I understand she is probably exhausted and wondering how to cope but that is way too much to expect."]}
