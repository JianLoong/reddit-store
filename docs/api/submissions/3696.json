I don\u2019t know why you even *want* to go when you can\u2019t seem to manage to get through an interaction with *either* of us without hurling insults, but if you think we\u2019ll be bringing that kind of treatment into the start of our lives together, think again.\u201d\n\nOr, y\u2019know, just block and ignore.  Clearly nothing positive can come of engaging with them further, so why waste your time?", "You are definitely NTA for not inviting parents who express their disappointment in your career and choice of partner openly. Further, it would be pretty AH to invite them after your partner, trying her best to be nice to them, got called names and insulted by your mother the whole time. That would be ignoring her very real feelings on the issue. \n\nIt's great that you're taking your partner's feelings into consideration over your obviously exhausting, entitled parents who can't even see your partner as a person or your career as valid.\n\nI hope you guys have a great wedding.", "NTA. \n\nGood for you for supporting your fiance. If they can't be nice to her before the wedding there's no guarantee they'll be nice to her during the wedding. At the price of these things, do you really want your day ruined cus your mom said something rude or did something atrocious?

Your mother is an asshole and she could cause a medical setback to your fianc\u00e9, maybe even her untimely death. CUT THESE TOXIC PEOPLE OUT OF YOUR LIFE! What did her mother do the whole time your mother was insulting her? As for your dad, tell the asshole that perhaps he should be talking to his not so better half on why she's the cause of all this. Maybe someone should zero in on your sister's shortcomings and see how she'll feel about herself. Your fianc\u00e9 was trying to win their approval. Tell her to stop, because I'm sorry to say, your family isn't worth it.\n\nBTW, if your mother is doing this to her during wedding dress shopping, imagine the vitriol she'll spew on your wedding day. Think of that and then ask yourself if you did the right thing.", "NTA your parents have a history of disrespecting your fianc\u00e9 and you in general about your life. They should be happy for you but it seems like they really just want to go to the wedding to cause issues and ruin it.  \n\n\nYou don't need people who treat you or people you care like that in your life. Just imagine what they will be like if the two of you have kids? I'm sure they will try to tell your kids all sorts of awful things about their mother or even just outright treat your children badly, or favor your sisters kids if she has any. It's not worth the stress and unhappiness it will cause the both of you.", "Perhaps this has taught your fiancee that your parents are not, and never will be, her friend. Now she can stop trying.  \n\nRealize from this that your family will probably try to make nice to you to get back on.  If and when this happens, know they will likely be hostile to her when you aren\u2019t around.  Believe her and support her; don\u2019t decide she is being sensitive.\n\nHint:  the two of you may benefit from making a strong and persistent effort to build friendships that create a family for yourselves.  In time, you both will have a stronger need for family and that is where you may want your family involved again. That may influence you to want your wife to just put up with the contempt your family will show her. Be wary of them saying they are sorry (especially if you have kids).", "It's been 6 years and you surely have seen and heard plenty of mean remarks from your mother if she's comfortable enough to call your fiancee a \"fat ugly pig\" at  bridal store. Un-inviting her from the wedding is a too-little-too-late gesture.\n\nESH (you and your mother). You have let this go on for years and you should have at the least stepped in to prevent your mother going to look for wedding dresses. \n\nYour girlfriend should legitimately be questioning whether she wants to link her life with you and your family.", "NTA.\n\nThey are detrimental to your SO's mental health. There need to be HUGE consequences for that awful behavior.  If your mom couldn't act right, she shouldn't have gone along.  Now, to address your sister and dad's BS arguments:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. You're allowed to be sensitive and protective toward the woman you want to make into your wife and family, as well as possible future mother to your children.  I wonder how your sister would feel if your mom used those insults toward HER.\n2. Your dad doesn't seem to want to acknowledge that your mom was being a terrible mom to treat your future wife that way.  You aren't taking anything away from them, your mom engaged in TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR that resulted in her losing the PRIVILEGE and HONOR of getting to be part of one of their son's most important days in his life.   If they keep it up, they may not be part of ANY of your most important days, such as (possibly) when you first become a dad.\n\nI applaud your swift and serious reaction to your mom's behavior.  It needed nipped in the bud NOW.  And there shouldn't be any second chances for her to ruin the process of the wedding either.  The BS she engaged in was way too much to forgive IMO. If your mom wanted to be part of this process, she should have acted right.   Since she's proven she can't, she can just cry to her flying monkeys about it while you keep on cherishing your future wife.\n\nCongrats on your engagement.\n\nI recommend you and your SO get into therapy so that your mom's behavior doesn't cause a setback in her recovery from her previous ED.", "do people who post here never stop to ask themselves if they really are the assholes", "That depends did the other people who went dress shopping with your fiance confirm that your mom was being verbally cruel?\n\nIf so NtA.\n\nYou have chosen this girl to be with and your parents should be happy your relationship is blossoming.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You should make this a clear boundary with mom that she CANNOT comment on your gf's weight at all. Not open to interpretation\n\nRegardless:NTA - your mom is entirely in the wrong for the way she is treating your gf. your sister is wrong for not seeing why it is wrong to NOT FUCKING CALL SOMEONE WITH AN EATING DISORDER FAT. (before someone comes at me, I am not fatphobic, but I do see a problem with calling someone fat when they have had a known eating disorder and have problems with their weight. Regardless of my own feelings on it as someone who is overweight with an eating disorder, you don't mess with someone with an eating disorder because it's so so so easy to slip back into those eating disorder habits because of the way people treat you.) \n\nMy suggestion at this point is to sit down with mom, have a conversation with her about why what she did is wrong and that if she continues this behavior towards your girlfriend whom you intend to spend the rest of your life with you will go no contact with her because your girlfriend is a person and deserves to be treated with that respect. \n\nI'm also concerned that if this is the kind of behavior your mom is already exhibiting she would cause some kind of problem on the day of your wedding.
