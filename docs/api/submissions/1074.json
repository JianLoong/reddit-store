I thought that was very inspirational and engaged in some more small talk with him before telling him I was on the clock and had to get  back to work.\n\nHe made a comment as to how he has always wanted to try the food where I work but could never afford it (I work at a Yogis Grill, nothing fancy). we sometimes have orders thst don't get picked up at night and can give those away or we get a free meal per shift. I never use mine so offered him something to eat. So I gave him his teriyaki chicken thanked him for the conversation and left grateful that night and genuinely wished him nothing but the best.\n\nwell, the past few days at work he has been waiting for me outside and like, has affected my breaks and just been making me super uncomfortable.  Asking me to untie his wrists so he could give me a hug. To which I don't get why he feels the need to try to make me take his arm to put around my waist for a hug, but then feel bad for laughing it off because he guy can't even move let alone feel anything so I don't know why I am making a big deal out of it, but it's just very awkward and I'll still try to be polite and give him a half hug and always say I'm in a hurry. \n\none night, I literally ran into Target and was hiding down the aisles and behind racks of clothes cuz he came whizzing in (those things go pretty fast!l) after me and I just really wanted to be alone and not feel awkward or uncomfortable. Finally, last night at work, after hiding in the back I finally just went out there and told him I couldn't give him anymore free food (cuz I was giving him food every night cuz I felt bad and didn't know what to do) and that my boss was on me and he apologized and asked if I'd ever visit him, to which I could only reply with that I'm pretty busy so don't wanna promise anything. \n\nI feel really bad though now because the guy is harmless, like, he literally can't move and I just couldn't even begin to imagine life like that....so I don't know why I'm acting like a victim or something, but he did start to get inappropriate and make me uncomfortable. Then, like, what if I was the only happy part of his day and then I just shunned him and is it really that horrible to take his arm to put around my waist for his idea of a hug? I mean, he can't feel anything....but...I dunno....its just been really weird and I've been feeling guilty and not sure if I handled things right or if I should just sacrifice my own comfort in order to bring a little happiness to this dude who doesn't have much.

In his case that means treating him like a harassing AH.\n\nHe is not 'harmless'; he has traded on your good nature to blag free food and to touch you. Shut him down next time he approaches you - sorry, but I'm not comfortable doing this, please go away, no I will not be visiting you' and report him to whoever you need to, up to and including your manager and the police, if he doesn't stop.\n\nEdited to add: NTA.", "NTA - doesn\u2019t matter who it\u2019s about, you don\u2019t have to give access to your body in any capacity to anybody you don\u2019t feel comfortable with.\n\nHowever, verbally explaining your boundaries and telling him you don\u2019t want any physical contact would have been a better solution here - if you enjoy his company but it\u2019s inconvenient you can arrange to meet at better times; and if you don\u2019t really want to talk to him anymore you can say \u201csorry, I\u2019m not really looking for new friends at the moment and don\u2019t have time to talk to you\u201d.\n\nThe fact that he\u2019s disabled does not really change the rules on how to manage his unwanted attention - you don\u2019t have to be friends with him because you feel sorry for him or because his situation is tough.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe he was knowingly pushing boundaries knowing you'd let him.\n\nEither way, what matters is that YOU were uncomfortable.
