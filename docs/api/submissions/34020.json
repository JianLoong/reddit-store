Does he have anger issues? Throws  stuff, hits things like tables and walls?", "\u201cI told my husband that this bothers me and he needs to tell his son to stop\u201d\n\nWhelp, stepson is no longer wearing the slippers.", "ESH.", "Not wrong and NTA. Your husband is a jerk. We don\u2019t know from your post why he threw away your very sweet gift to him. Don\u2019t buy him another one, this year or next. I bet this isn\u2019t the only time he\u2019s been mean to you, is it? For 2024, give yourself the gift of a visit to a divorce lawyer.", "I think you may need more relationship advice than a verdict in this particular situation. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019d say YTA for making this an issue about the slippers when clearly there is so much more going on.", "NTA. Your husband is being a Grade A Asshole.", "Pick your battles, lady.\n\nIf you typically pick on your stepson, that\u2019s probably your husband\u2019s way of telling you that it was just another excuse for your complaints, and he\u2019s removing the excuse so your behavior is more transparent. Do better and Y T A.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t about your resentment for your stepson, then E S H. You for kicking up a fuss about slippers. You can\u2019t force people to use your gifts in a specific manner. You lose all control once the gift is given. And him for pitching the gift out of irritation.\n\nWhatever the case, people matter more than things.", "This sounds like there's a lot of miscommunication between you, where this is more the final straw for each of you rather than the full problem. Whether I've read that correctly or not, the answer is more communication. You got him the slippers as a gift and you were hurt when you saw that he was ok with his son wearing the slippers too. Your husband allowing your (step)son to share the slippers isn't necessarily an indication of your husband not appreciating or cherishing your gift. What didn't happen that made you feel like he wasn't happy that you gave him what he asked for? Has he not worn them at all? Have you asked him for what you need, even if you feel silly admitting it? In what ways did you say you were unfair that he was willing to share the slippers with your (step) son?\n\nIt's reasonable for you to be angry that he threw them in the bin. But was it unreasonable of him to think removing the slippers from the situation would fix the problem? What does he think the problem was?\n\nIf there are conversations you've been avoiding, you should have them. There's never a good time, but before you or he explode and say or do unforgivable things if a better time than afterwards.\n\nESH, but communication will help.", "ESH - this didn\u2019t need to be a big deal (your fault) and your husband didn\u2019t need to escalate it by throwing them out.", "Was he ur second husband? Maybe first is triggeribg him", "Yta", "YTA. It was a pair of slippers. Who cares that your step son was wearing them? It didn\u2019t bother the owner of the slippers. It sounds like your husband is tired of you picking on his son.", "This isn't about slippers. YTA", "ESH\n\nYou got him shitty slippers and his kid found a use for them, and for some reason you went all hissy. Him throwing them out instead of just telling you he didn't like them is childish. Everyone sucks here, except the kid who actually found a use for a crappy gift.", "ESH - There's no reason to be upset that your stepson is wearing his dad's slippers. It really, really, truly, does not matter. \n\nYou're an asshole for making this into a fight. Your husband is an asshole for escalating the fight by throwing them out. (The stepson doesn't seem to have done anything wrong.)", "ESH, it's his gift, let him use it how he wants, when you gift something it's for THEM to do whatever they want with, not for you to force them to use it to your liking, if sharing makes him happy, you should be happy too. His reaction was also childish. Are you guys really 40?", "YTA. Are you always this exhausting and looking to be the victim on non-issues? So what if his son used the slippers? Sharing clothes is normal if you are the same size and have similar tastes. Your husband didn't have a problem with his son borrowing his slippers. You would have to be really petty and resent the stepson a lot to complain and moan so much that your husband is driven to throw out the slippers rather than listen any more to your self pitying BS drama.", "ESH you didn't need to get upset about his son wearing them, and he didn't need to throw them out.", "ESH. You both are AH in a way.", "Idk who the AH is but this story is funny lol.", "I bet he was married to the stepsons mother.", "Agreed. And stepson is actually giving you a compliment/that your gift to his dad was so cool, he wants to wear them. Why not get two pairs #1 dad and #1 son.", "Hahahahahahaha!!!"]}
