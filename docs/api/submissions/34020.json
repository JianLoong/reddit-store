Your husband is a jerk. We don\u2019t know from your post why he threw away your very sweet gift to him. Don\u2019t buy him another one, this year or next. I bet this isn\u2019t the only time he\u2019s been mean to you, is it? For 2024, give yourself the gift of a visit to a divorce lawyer.", "I think you may need more relationship advice than a verdict in this particular situation. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019d say YTA for making this an issue about the slippers when clearly there is so much more going on.", "NTA. Your husband is being a Grade A Asshole.", "Pick your battles, lady.\n\nIf you typically pick on your stepson, that\u2019s probably your husband\u2019s way of telling you that it was just another excuse for your complaints, and he\u2019s removing the excuse so your behavior is more transparent. Do better and Y T A.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t about your resentment for your stepson, then E S H. You for kicking up a fuss about slippers. You can\u2019t force people to use your gifts in a specific manner. You lose all control once the gift is given. And him for pitching the gift out of irritation.\n\nWhatever the case, people matter more than things.", "This sounds like there's a lot of miscommunication between you, where this is more the final straw for each of you rather than the full problem. Whether I've read that correctly or not, the answer is more communication. You got him the slippers as a gift and you were hurt when you saw that he was ok with his son wearing the slippers too. Your husband allowing your (step)son to share the slippers isn't necessarily an indication of your husband not appreciating or cherishing your gift. What didn't happen that made you feel like he wasn't happy that you gave him what he asked for? Has he not worn them at all? Have you asked him for what you need, even if you feel silly admitting it? In what ways did you say you were unfair that he was willing to share the slippers with your (step) son?\n\nIt's reasonable for you to be angry that he threw them in the bin. But was it unreasonable of him to think removing the slippers from the situation would fix the problem? What does he think the problem was?\n\nIf there are conversations you've been avoiding, you should have them. There's never a good time, but before you or he explode and say or do unforgivable things if a better time than afterwards.\n\nESH, but communication will help.", "ESH - this didn\u2019t need to be a big deal (your fault) and your husband didn\u2019t need to escalate it by throwing them out.", "Was he ur second husband?

YTA", "ESH\n\nYou got him shitty slippers and his kid found a use for them, and for some reason you went all hissy. Him throwing them out instead of just telling you he didn't like them is childish. Everyone sucks here, except the kid who actually found a use for a crappy gift.", "ESH - There's no reason to be upset that your stepson is wearing his dad's slippers. It really, really, truly, does not matter. \n\nYou're an asshole for making this into a fight. Your husband is an asshole for escalating the fight by throwing them out. (The stepson doesn't seem to have done anything wrong.)", "ESH, it's his gift, let him use it how he wants, when you gift something it's for THEM to do whatever they want with, not for you to force them to use it to your liking, if sharing makes him happy, you should be happy too. His reaction was also childish. Are you guys really 40?", "YTA. Are you always this exhausting and looking to be the victim on non-issues? So what if his son used the slippers? Sharing clothes is normal if you are the same size and have similar tastes. Your husband didn't have a problem with his son borrowing his slippers. You would have to be really petty and resent the stepson a lot to complain and moan so much that your husband is driven to throw out the slippers rather than listen any more to your self pitying BS drama.", "ESH you didn't need to get upset about his son wearing them, and he didn't need to throw them out.", "ESH. You both are AH in a way.", "Idk who the AH is but this story is funny lol.", "I bet he was married to the stepsons mother.", "Agreed.

Your husband has anger management issues - that reaction was way over the top. Then he has the gall to accuse you of being dramatic? Lol.

It\u2019s not the slippers that are bothering you, and I bet your husband knows this which is why he reacted as he did.", "Yta, you can't control what someone does with a gift, if he doesn't mind sharing that isn't him being an asshole, you don't need to take that personally,  they are after all, even though a gift from you, slippers.

Something in a style or colour I already like.\n\nI like making art. I've been doing it a long time and have gradually built up a selection of good quality artist grade paintbrushes. I have mafe commissioned artwork and sold pieces.\n\nIt really annoyed me when someone bought me a large pack of cheap, rubbish paintbrushes. They shed their hairs and didn't keep their shape, so paint ended up where it wasn't intended to be.\n\nHonestly, I'd rather have them buy me one decent quality brush than a large set of rubbish ones, even if they said \"world's greatest artist.\"\n\nIt's about showing your knowledge of the person, not ticking the box. If you haven't thought about what would serve the person well, you are buying the gift for yourself, not for them.", "You're the dramatic one, not your husband.

They're slippers ffs, not a hand made shirt or something sentimental.", "YTA - unless there's more of the story than you're telling you come across as ridiculously petty.  Why would you even care about a pair of slippers for god's sake, is it really the end of the world?  Get over yourself.", "ESH\n\nYou because you announced your disapproval of how your husband was using your gift. I regularly share my gifts with my kids. This is normal parenting. Kids are curious, interested, and maybe they just like the grownup stuff more than their kid stuff.\n\nHim because he decided to bin the cause of the nagging rather than actually deal with the situation.\n\nYou because you then called him names(dramatic) instead of dealing with the situation.\n\nAn easy solution would have been to get your stepson his own pair of slippers just like dad's pair, since he liked them so much. Slippers aren't expensive. This is an easy solve. The situation should have never ended up with throwing things in the bin and name calling.", "You sound exhausting.

If that's community slippers then so be it. \n\n  \nYTA", "I think there is something else going on with how much you disliked your stepson wearing his father's slippers, and I think the overreaction of throwing them away was really about that. The slippers were a gift he asked for, so it's not like you went out of your way to find something special and personal... they are just slippers. The only reason I can think of to explain why you would care if your stepson uses them is that you have negative feelings towards him that you need to explore. Your husband is obviously comfortable sharing his thing with his son, and you are obviously not. Why is that? Do you disliked or resent your husband's son? Why?\n\nYTA, and if you want to get all proprietary and weird about gifts you should start by trying a little harder than buying slippers someone asked for. That's a minor gift to start with and by making a big deal out of your resentment of your stepson over them, you turned it into a crappy gift. I'd have thrown them away, too, just to drive home that my son is more important to me than some shitty house shoes you bought.", "YTA and the worst type of gift giver.

It's nothing deeper than that.\n\nI feel like he either can't be bothered with her nagging him or finds it off-putting that his own child wearing something of his bothers OP so much.\n\nI must admit him just yeeting the slippers out of the house did make me laugh!", "Agreed.

They are slippers.", "So many times I borrowed dad\u2019s flip flops when outside because I couldn\u2019t be bothered going to find mine (his pair lived outdoors).

This woman needs to GROW UP", "It reads to me like she bought him a tacky gift \u201c#1 husband\u201d and he didn\u2019t like the gift but at least his kid was getting some use out of them and then she threw a hissy fit. I bet these slippers cost about $20.", "Or even worse - slept with her!", "Good quality slippers are a good gift, especially since he wished for slippers.
