I told him his parents were right and that he shouldn\u2019t have told the boy off for it. \n\nI\u2019ve always been in support of people being free to express themselves however they want and be happy in their own skin. He said he didn\u2019t want his boys to be \u2018confused\u2019 and that he\u2019s too young to be exploring his sexuality. I explained to him he was being ridiculous, I\u2019d dated straight men who wore nail polish in the past and regardless it didn\u2019t matter he should support his son no matter what and encourage him to be himself. \n\nI do my nails myself all the time and do funky themes and styles. I was watching Bryan one day and I had a mermaid theme on my nails, Bryan said he liked it and wanted me to do the same for him. My nails were resin so I used a similar colour I had in polish. He was so happy and kept showing off the colour to his brother. \n\nWhen Reece came back he absolutely exploded when he saw Bryan\u2019s nails. Said I had no right to encourage his boy to be trans, I said I\u2019m not encouraging him to be anything and that he was being small minded. I explained to him that he saw my nails, liked them and wanted something similar. Regardless he ignored me and then grabbed his boys and stormed off. He hasn\u2019t spoken to me in over a week. I still feel like it\u2019s only nail polish, his own mother put polish on him and it\u2019s not permanent. I was just trying to cheer up a little boy. AITA?\n\nEdit: I genuinely thought my lecture about inclusivity and acceptance had got through to him. He didn\u2019t really say much, but he didn\u2019t argue back or counter my points. \n\nHe also gets super offended when I accuse him of being a homophobe. He claims he doesn\u2019t have a problem with people living their lives as long as they aren\u2019t harming anyone and that he \u201chas friends that are gay\u201d so he can\u2019t be homophobic \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.\n\nAlso he\u2019s never been physically violent to me or his ex or his boys, just shouty.", "created_utc": 1697386504, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178isw3/aita_for_painting_my_boyfriends_sons_nails/", "score": 187, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You set him up for that knowing it was a possibility. You need to be more careful both with kids who are just exploring the diversity of expression, and with the queer folks around you. I never have kids leave my home presenting in a way that I know will get them in trouble at home. They can express themselves however they like while in my home, but for their own safety I am careful about how they leave it.

Reece is TA\n\nLike I said already it's not harmful which is the only reason to care about a rule like this. There's no reason to respect that rule just because he imposed it on his son.

As I said, it's a spectrum. So I gave the most extreme example... because its a spectrum. If you can't understand that... then there's no point continuing. Parents do NOT have ownership; they have responsibility. Responsibility to ensure that their offspring are brought up to be balanced, sensible, self-confident and reasonable and responsible and knowledgable members of the society into which they are emerging. I seriously hope you have nothing to do with kids if you don't recognise that.\n\nIf you think guilt-shaming a child over painted nails is appropriate, then I pity you and your children. Again, I bet you wouldn't do the same over face-painting. What's the difference?", "THAT IS STILL BIGOTRY. STOP BEING OBTUSE. IF HE US TRANSPHOBIC HE IS MORE THAN LIKELY HOMOPHOBIC.", "The last comment where you gave up trying to fight a losing argument and fell back on an argument that I had already agreed to? So you acknowledge defeat then?", "I guess everyone\u2019s got to have some sort of goal in life.", "Cultures change \ud83d\ude0a makeup used to be for men only in france so what now? Secondly, child marriage is also a cultural norm in some places. Cultural norms doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right, just that it\u2019s certain peoples choices to live their lives that way.", "Guess you've never watched baseball. Catchers pretty regularly paint their nails bright colors in order to make signals to the pitcher more clear. Straight male Rockstars have been painting their nails since the 80s. Go back to 1950.", "You didn\u2019t shut down anyone. Your perpetuating shitty homophonic bs showing your shitty bigoted upbringing. Your \ud83c\udf46 must be microscopic that you have to make ignorant statements on fixing Reddit to feel good about yourself \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "Culture norms can change and are rooted in absolutely nothing.", "Exactly. Endangering this child will not make the dad less bigoted.", "OP has no control over how the children are raised.", "They should intervene when that intervention won't make the child a target for worse abuse. \n\nIn ops scenario the child was growing up with a bigot. Not nice but child wasn't an active victim.\n\nOps intervention has now left the child to be screamed at, maybe worse, by an angry bigot. \n\nOp could have supported the child by talking in a positive light about lgbt people and self acceptance. That would have been more beneficial than having the child screamed at and berated.", "It would be great if people would confront bigoted parents more, but most worry about the kids facing the brunt of the parents being pissed about it. \n\nJust like why kids that are abused, sometimes noticeably, they refuse to tell people because they worry that when their parents are confronted the abuse will get worse. And it's not an unreasonable fear, just wish society would find a way to make it an unreasonable fear. More kids would probably be helped.", "You talk a lot about creativity for someone who's given zero actual ideas, and just recycles the word creativity.", "If you want to let other people raise your kids how they want then go for it, sounds like great parenting, you crack on.", "using all capitals is a sign of strong argument \ud83d\ude02", "The comment where I shutdown your argument yet you try to keep dragging it on by changing the wording in your sentence. \ud83d\ude0a Refer to that one! It gets old arguing with people I am clearly more intelligent than, but they try to sound smart on the internet with some word play LOL\n\nIts so blatant, it\u2019s hilarious.", "Not your place to tell a parent how to raise their kid. Especially in a situation like this. Are you all delusional?\n\nYou would literally make the same argument against republicans telling you that your kid cant be transgender and you cant raise them like that. Lmao. Raise your kid how you feel is necessary, as long as its legal. \n\nAs much as everyone else wants to argue, you are all wrong and this dad was in the right. Nothing you do or say will change that.", "Boring \ud83e\udd71", "Not homophobic at all. Just for parental rights. Nice try though, that argument wont work here! \ud83d\ude02 get fucked loser!", "Yes but it is the norm NOW.", "What's your favourite idea?\n\nMine is being creative.", "I accept that it's true in this case that OP should have been more creative in her dealing with the bigot. I'm more curious about the larger conversation about when we DO intervene. \n\nIs there anything you can think of that OP could do to remove the bigot from this situation?", "That's not the point. The point is that a parent has a responsibility to raise a child responsibly for the society in which they will become an independent adult and can feel comfortable being themselves. It's finding the boundaries between individual wants, and societal needs. It is not easy, and no one ever gets it perfect. Because its impossible.\n\n\nBut dragging ones child out of a situation as simple and meaningless as painted bloody nails will set them up with a complex for life. Just wrong. They will enter adult life feeling guilty for simplyvexpressing their own harmless desires."]}
