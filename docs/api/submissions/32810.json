Over the years Tony and I clashed. He wanted to adopt me, to change my last name to his and told me repeatedly to call him dad. I didn't want that and the adoption petition was denied by two judges after I spoke to one of them. Neither were happy with the outcome but I was relieved.\n\nTony and my mom have three daughters together, my half sisters. Tony tried to use the birth of the first one to convince me to give taking his name a chance. He said it would tie us all together. I told him the connection to my dad was more important than being tied to them. He told me I hated my last name just like my dad had, so wanted to know why I was so stubborn when I could have a better last name. I told him it was my dad's name and I wanted to keep it.\n\nWhen I was 17/18 I realized mom and Tony were lying to my half sisters and telling them Tony was my dad but I was just born before he and mom got married, which is why I had a different last name. They even convinced the girls I look like Tony. I told my mom I knew and as soon as I graduated high school I moved out and told her not to expect me to be a part of the family anymore. My mom told me I was overreacting and I should have been kinder to Tony and given him a chance. I told her there is no replacing dad and they needed to get over that wish, because pushing the adoption, name change and calling him dad was only going to look like replacing dad.\n\nMy wife and I got married a couple of years ago. We had a very small, private wedding because of Covid. I did not invite my mom or her family. However, for the last few months we had more contact and she told me she wanted to be a grandma to our now 5 month old son. We have met up 3 times since my son was born. The first time mom and Tony both had a bad reaction to my son's name. He's named after my dad. But not the name people called my dad. The name my dad wished he'd had and the name he wrote for himself. Tony also made a snarky comment about me taking my wife's name when I wouldn't take his.\n\nThe last time we saw each other was two weeks ago. That time and the time before it my half sister's asked why I didn't name my baby after their dad, why I named him after someone who died, etc. Last time I told them Tony wasn't my dad, my son was named after my actual dad and that's why we chose the name we did. They told me I was wrong and said he should have been named after Tony. Mom and Tony both sat there almost smiling.\n\nI sent them both a message afterward saying if they don't nip the girls comments in the bud we won't be seeing each other again and I don't care if that upsets them or not. They replied that the girls have a right to their questions and comments and I can't take \"their grandson\" away from them. They also said I was behaving childishly. I wish I had never started contact back up with them at all.

You honestly tried to have a relationship with your mom, stepdad, and half-sisters, and clearly, they didn't grow as individuals. It is also disgusting that they lied to your half-sisters. What you need to do now, if you decide to cut them off, is to document as much evidence you have of this behaviour from the past until now (including this post). Save messages, emails, voice recordings, etc. Do this especially if they ramp up the harassment. You need to be concerned that they will go after grandparent's rights if that is something established in your area. If you continue to have them hang out with your son their case will get stronger. I would also install surveillance around the house if they know where you live. If your son goes to some form of school, ensure the administrators have an updated pick-up and drop-off list and let them know that certain individuals are not allowed around your child.

Simply explain how you felt growing up and that, although you \"appreciate' that Tony has done for you and wanted to be a father figure to you, it was important to you as a child to feel a connection to your biological dad who raised you and cared for you until you were 8, and as far as you are aware did nothing wrong to you but love you. Tell them how sad you felt at the time (barely 10) that everyone around you seemed to want to erase this part of your story of your identity and this is why you fought so hard to keep this name. Ask them how they might have felt in this situation at that age.

Tony is their actual dad and they love him, and from their perspective they saw how much he wanted to be your dad and how he did support and take care of you.

Over the years Tony and I clashed. He wanted to adopt me, to change my last name to his and told me repeatedly to call him dad. I didn't want that and the adoption petition was denied by two judges after I spoke to one of them. Neither were happy with the outcome but I was relieved.\n\nTony and my mom have three daughters together, my half sisters. Tony tried to use the birth of the first one to convince me to give taking his name a chance. He said it would tie us all together. I told him the connection to my dad was more important than being tied to them. He told me I hated my last name just like my dad had, so wanted to know why I was so stubborn when I could have a better last name. I told him it was my dad's name and I wanted to keep it.\n\nWhen I was 17/18 I realized mom and Tony were lying to my half sisters and telling them Tony was my dad but I was just born before he and mom got married, which is why I had a different last name. They even convinced the girls I look like Tony. I told my mom I knew and as soon as I graduated high school I moved out and told her not to expect me to be a part of the family anymore. My mom told me I was overreacting and I should have been kinder to Tony and given him a chance. I told her there is no replacing dad and they needed to get over that wish, because pushing the adoption, name change and calling him dad was only going to look like replacing dad.\n\nMy wife and I got married a couple of years ago. We had a very small, private wedding because of Covid. I did not invite my mom or her family. However, for the last few months we had more contact and she told me she wanted to be a grandma to our now 5 month old son. We have met up 3 times since my son was born. The first time mom and Tony both had a bad reaction to my son's name. He's named after my dad. But not the name people called my dad. The name my dad wished he'd had and the name he wrote for himself. Tony also made a snarky comment about me taking my wife's name when I wouldn't take his.\n\nThe last time we saw each other was two weeks ago. That time and the time before it my half sister's asked why I didn't name my baby after their dad, why I named him after someone who died, etc. Last time I told them Tony wasn't my dad, my son was named after my actual dad and that's why we chose the name we did. They told me I was wrong and said he should have been named after Tony. Mom and Tony both sat there almost smiling.\n\nI sent them both a message afterward saying if they don't nip the girls comments in the bud we won't be seeing each other again and I don't care if that upsets them or not. They replied that the girls have a right to their questions and comments and I can't take \"their grandson\" away from them. They also said I was behaving childishly. I wish I had never started contact back up with them at all. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
