{"id": 23138, "submission_id": "159qeoq", "title": "AITA for calling my stepmom out for making my graduation weekend about her and my cousins?", "selftext": "I (24F) am graduated with my masters in applied math from Florida State earlier this summer. This degree was soooo grueling, and I am beyond relieved just to be done. I decided to invite my mom, dad, stepmom (his wife), and my aunt uncle and cousins from my mom's side of the family. A little background: I believe my stepmom is a narc, because of how she always behaves around me. She used to always put me down when I would fail at something, like not making NHS by 2 gpa points in high school, and was constantly comparing me to my cousins (dads' nephew and niece whom she is practically OBSESSED with) and her one nephew who was salutatorian. She would constantly take stabs at picking on me every time id visit, going as far back as when I was a kid. \n\nWell graduation weekend rolls around and stepmom texts me saying she would be making dinner reservations for just her, my dad, and I at some fancy restaurant in town. I told her that was nice of them but I would not be getting dinner with anybody as that Friday I had to work in the morning, get my hair done in the afternoon, and then get ready before the ceremony that night. And the next night I would be hosting a soiree in my apartment (my first place all to myself) and inviting everybody from work as well as my friends in the area. Stepmom immediately wrote back claiming that I made my dad upset and that it wasn't fair to them after they would have to drive 8 hours just to make the ceremony. I told her sorry, but my plans are firm, but you both are still invited like everybody else is. \n\nOnce they roll into town, I stopped by their hotel to say hello and my dad hugs me and tells me he understands about my party and not to worry about the dinner. Stepmom however was fussy the whole time she didn't get her way. We went up to their hotel room to catch up and enjoy some wine, and my dad starts talking about how proud he is of me that I'm graduating with this degree and with a high gpa. I told him thanks for being so supportive, then stepmom immediately chimes in and starts talking about my cousins. She mentions that my female cousin, call her 'J', is doing soooo well at her nursing job and is already up for a promotion. She then mentions my male cousin, A, got a high paying job and is still doing stuff with his frat. She then continued to blabber on about how they're sooo smart and accomplished, are such great athletes, and always made high marks in school because of how dedicated and smart they are. I told her thats great and 'good for them', only for her to suggest I start being happy for others in addition to myself. I responded, \"I'm sorry, but are A and J graduating with a masters degree this weekend? No? You need to stop hijacking my graduation weekend from me and stop making it about them and you!\" Her face got red and she started getting defensive, claiming I am just jealous and creating problems, with my dad joining in with her. I then told them to knock off their nonsense, but AITA here?\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1690331553, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/159qeoq/aita_for_calling_my_stepmom_out_for_making_my/", "score": 278, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is narcissistic as can be... as you well know. Too bad your father doesn't see it. \n\nAnd CONGRATULATIONS on getting your Masters!!", "LOL\n\nNTA. Of course she got defensive, you called her out.", "NTA. Your stepmom doesn\u2019t like you very much, probably because your dad loves you and it takes away her limelight. She spent every opportunity comparing you to people in other career fields\u2026 for no good reason. I\u2019m a bit surprised you invited her, to begin with. You clearly do not get along.   \n\n\nThat\u2019s just my take, blah blah blah, don\u2019t jump down my throat in the comments. I get that spouses stick up for each other and step parenthood is not easy. But you don\u2019t piss on someone\u2019s accomplishments, and you don\u2019t schedule dinners without asking first if the other party has plans. Rude.", "Absolutely NTA, and don\u2019t let her or anyone make you believe otherwise. This is your graduation and your time to shine! If she wants to be with your cousins and do what she wants to do, then she can see herself out. Better yet, just uninvite her", "NTA\n\nCongratulations! \n\nExpect nothing to change with your father and Stepmother.", "No, not at all!!!", "NTA your step mother is jealous of the love an attention you get from your dad.\n\nHow pathetic!\n\nCongratulations I hope your party is fun", "NTA\n\nCongratulations!", "Nta id tell them they can drive their ass back home for all I care and to not call until your stepmom charges her attitude. Congratulations on the masters", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s the jealous one.", "NTA", "NTA, at all!  First of all, Congratulations!!!!  How wonderful!!!  Great job!!!  Nobody should be talking about anyone else, but you and your achievements this weekend, because you deserve ALL the attention!  Did your dad and SM forget that math is hard AF?  No, sweetie, you did fantastic, especially being a woman in a STEM field!!!  If you were my kid, people would run away every time they saw me, because I would talk about you so much!  \ud83d\udc9e\ud83c\udf88\ud83c\udf89", "NTA\n\"Knock off their nonsense\" is the perfect response.", "Hell yeah!

You\u2019ve invited family to travel sixteen hours to see you, and you won\u2019t have dinner with them, AND you aren\u2019t inviting them to the party to celebrate the thing they\u2019re there to celebrate?", "YTA. Here is the thing. You are graduating (or just graduated) and that\u2019s amazing! I\u2019m so proud of you!!! But\u2026you literally invited your family for your graduation and basically told them they weren\u2019t worth your time. I want you to come but I won\u2019t even have dinner with you after you spent the entire day driving to see me and paid for a hotel room. You hurt them and you don\u2019t care. I question what the real conversation was like.", "YTA, you invited them to your graduation. They drove 8 hours and got a hotel room and you could not even be arsed to go to dinner with them.

My husband also has a Master's in math from FSU, so I know how rigorous the program is and how hard you have to study to pass your comps, so congrats! I guess your life isn't interesting enough for her to live vicariously through you, but that's a huge positive. Imagine if she was going around bragging on your accomplishments at other people's ceremonies as if it was anything to do with her or the appropriate time to be doing so. How embarrassing for your cousins.", "NTA. Your stepmom is though she really has some mental issues to want to crush your joyous occasion and it\u2019s a shame your father can\u2019t see that too. An applied math degree, especially a masters is no joking matter so congrats OP.", "NTA. Your stepmother seems a bit threatened by your existence and tries her best to take any attention you may get away from you. I think you handled it just fine, and have nothing to feel badly about. Congratulations on earning your masters! That's quite an accomplishment!!", "NTA!\n\nYour dad signed up to be her narcissist agent. It's nice that he at least got a few minutes to praise you and let you know he was fine with your plans. I hope you can sometimes see him without Stepmom around - so that he gets to enjoy your company without having to choose between normal relations with you and catering to his wife.\n\nBut that was a choice he made. Not your problem to solve or your eggshells to walk carefully over to preserve. There's a limit to the slack/grace you will give them in the face of her narcissism. They aren't going to like that, but it doesn't make you an AH in any way.", "NTA. And congratulations on your Masters! That is so wonderful!", "NTA", "NTA.  Stepmom is jealous of you and sees you as competition for your father's attention.   Plan accordingly.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds horrible", "NTA\ncongratulations!!", "NTA- She is a stepmonster. Tell your dad you will go NC if he doesn't put an end to her nonsense", "You should reread OP\u2019s post", "This! She calls stepmother a narc, but it is OP thar is giving those vibes in this post."]}
