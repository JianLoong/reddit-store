{"id": 23138, "submission_id": "159qeoq", "title": "AITA for calling my stepmom out for making my graduation weekend about her and my cousins?", "selftext": "I (24F) am graduated with my masters in applied math from Florida State earlier this summer. This degree was soooo grueling, and I am beyond relieved just to be done. I decided to invite my mom, dad, stepmom (his wife), and my aunt uncle and cousins from my mom's side of the family. A little background: I believe my stepmom is a narc, because of how she always behaves around me. She used to always put me down when I would fail at something, like not making NHS by 2 gpa points in high school, and was constantly comparing me to my cousins (dads' nephew and niece whom she is practically OBSESSED with) and her one nephew who was salutatorian. She would constantly take stabs at picking on me every time id visit, going as far back as when I was a kid. \n\nWell graduation weekend rolls around and stepmom texts me saying she would be making dinner reservations for just her, my dad, and I at some fancy restaurant in town. I told her that was nice of them but I would not be getting dinner with anybody as that Friday I had to work in the morning, get my hair done in the afternoon, and then get ready before the ceremony that night. And the next night I would be hosting a soiree in my apartment (my first place all to myself) and inviting everybody from work as well as my friends in the area. Stepmom immediately wrote back claiming that I made my dad upset and that it wasn't fair to them after they would have to drive 8 hours just to make the ceremony. I told her sorry, but my plans are firm, but you both are still invited like everybody else is. \n\nOnce they roll into town, I stopped by their hotel to say hello and my dad hugs me and tells me he understands about my party and not to worry about the dinner. Stepmom however was fussy the whole time she didn't get her way. We went up to their hotel room to catch up and enjoy some wine, and my dad starts talking about how proud he is of me that I'm graduating with this degree and with a high gpa. I told him thanks for being so supportive, then stepmom immediately chimes in and starts talking about my cousins. She mentions that my female cousin, call her 'J', is doing soooo well at her nursing job and is already up for a promotion. She then mentions my male cousin, A, got a high paying job and is still doing stuff with his frat. She then continued to blabber on about how they're sooo smart and accomplished, are such great athletes, and always made high marks in school because of how dedicated and smart they are. I told her thats great and 'good for them', only for her to suggest I start being happy for others in addition to myself. I responded, \"I'm sorry, but are A and J graduating with a masters degree this weekend? No? You need to stop hijacking my graduation weekend from me and stop making it about them and you!\" Her face got red and she started getting defensive, claiming I am just jealous and creating problems, with my dad joining in with her. I then told them to knock off their nonsense, but AITA here?\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1690331553, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/159qeoq/aita_for_calling_my_stepmom_out_for_making_my/", "score": 1737, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Judging from her behavior in the past, though, she is probably not going to change so don't expect her to. Either decide  to let it roll of your back or avoid her. At 24 with a master's degree, you can probably let it roll off of your back.\n\nI do, however, see a glaring A  H move on your part! Did you tell the people you were inviting to your graduation that you would be unavailable to them the rest of the weekend? I understand having to work. What I do not understand is why you planned your first soiree that weekend, and only invited friends from there in town and co-workers. Why couldn't you include your family and friends who have traveled many hours for the purpose of watching you graduate to the party too? It seems like a lot to ask people to come in from out of town just to see you graduate if you have no plans to spend significant time with them during the weekend. Honestly, unless you went to a very small college, it is difficult/almost impossible to even see the graduates clearly so the only time they might see you during the ceremony is when your name is announced and you walk across the stage to accept your diploma. As a graduate who was not moving out of a dorm room that weekend, you could have been gracious and certainly more polite and invited your graduation guests to your soiree. I mean, really!

Trying to belittle your obvious sucesses and accomplishment is such a projection of her own insecurities.", "Fuck them, Go Noles!", "NTA.\n\nAlso your Stepmom is clearly the problem, she is trying to take your dad's attention away from your amazing accomplishments. She has the personality of a \"Gold digger\".", "NTA - Congrats on your degree thooo!!!!", "NTA. Why did you invite someone so toxic?", "Nta", "NTA, go NC and keep doing amazing in life. Let your accomplishments be the reminder that you don't need this hate in your life.\n\nAnd why they try to come crawling back for money block them again!!!!!!!", "You're step-mom is a major A H, you are NTAH.", "NTA. Congrats on your Masters! \n\nAnd uninvite the narc stepmom from the soiree. Don't need that kind of negativity.", "NTA!\n\nYou got a post graduate degree in a tough field -- and you're also moving to your own home.\n\nSee if you can find ways to spend time with just with your dad and ditch stepmom.", "Congrats on the Masters, that's pretty intense! I have friends in that field. I'm a major STEM person and my brain hurt every time I would even talk to them about it.", "NTA.  Why does your dad allow this ?", "It was just the step mom, not the dad", "Came here for this just to give a TIL moment for op.  narc is short for narcotics, not narcissist.  NTA Op! and congrats on the masters.", "she has no accomplishments, except for stealing his dad's attention", "true dat", "Congrats on your Masters, that is an awesome accomplishment. Next time ask Stepmom if those cousins can even spell the names of the courses you took to get your degrees?", "It said her dad joined in on the bitching and whining. Also it\u2019s been going on for years while he just let his daughter be put down and belittled as he watched he is a failure as a father for not protecting and standing up for his daughter", "This isn\u2019t the comment I meant to put the reply on, it w@s some other comment saying to send \u201cTHEM\u201d home, meaning both the dad and stepmom, sorry for the confusion", "The comment is right below this thread", "Let me get this straight....\n\nYou have *Masters* in **APPLIED MATHS**. Did I read that right? I did. Is your step mom dumb?\n\nNTA\n\nbro you're brilliant af btw", "NTA. Your stepmom sounds like a real piece of work. Good luck with that.\n\nCongratulations on graduating with your master's degree in any case!", "Congrats on your degree!\n\nNo, of course you are NTA!\n\nYou just called a bully to heel, and did it very well.\n\nAnd of course your dad felt that he should defend his wife. Poor guy, you may imagine from this how his home life is looking.\n\nShake if off and enjoy your weekend of celebrations!", "Congrats on your Masters. No one can take that away from you!", "ESH. Your stepmom was wrong for trying to pull focus from you on your graduation day. However, YTA for having family drive 8 hours (maybe 16 round trip?) and then not planning to spend any real time with them. \n\nI know I have a bias on this topic because I'm still annoyed 3 years later that my stepdaughter did something similar to my husband and I. We literally spent over $2k and took PTO to travel to another state to watch my stepdaughter perform in a middle school production of The Little Mermaid, and she couldn't be bothered to have breakfast with us because she 'didn't feel like going out in the morning'. Her mom also booked up the rest of her availability for the weekend because that's just how she is as a coparent. \n\nThis thread always shits all over stepparents but we're real people with personal lives and feelings too. It's frustrating to make these big investments of time and money to maintain the relationship when the street doesn't go both ways.", "Your step-mom sounds like my mother (RIP). Growing up, I am ALWAYS compared to cousins. We were poor, cousins are rich AF. Proper rich too, since we are in a third world country. I grew up in a place where I have to fetch water for my daily bath, while cousins live in air-conditioned houses in subdivisions with cars, cable, own rooms, and one even have a stay-home servant. I spend summer breaks helping out my parents in our little store, carrying and buying in bulk from the big stores to sell in our little store. While cousins have piano lessons and ballet schools and swimming lessons and out-of-country vacations. Whenever I have achievements, mother would ALWAYS quip in \"... But did you know, cousin Clare had her ballet recital? Such a talented girl\"... \"... You should be more like Mildred, look at her so simple and meek\" - - - I was and still am, flamboyant. On my 18th birthday (traditionally, 18 is a debut party where a girl wears gowns and dances and stuff), we are poor so parents talked to me that they can only give me a small amount of money to treaty my closest friends to a Wendy's. No big deal. I understand. When I got back home, I showed my parents what my friends bought me for my 18 bday (a small locket, a big teddy bear and 3 oranges because those are my fav fruits at the time). My Mother said, \"you know, cousin Clare told her parents that instead of spending money for her debut party, they should just donate to charity\". Yup, that was it. That was the moment I know that it's fruitless to try and get affirmation and approval from my Mother.", "NTA. You get to be the lead in your own movies congrats on your graduation!", "ESH .... this whole situation sounds totally f'ed up. \n\nWho invites people to drive 8 hours and can't be bothered making time to have dinner with them? And who would have a graduation dinner without inviting everyone attending the graduation on their behalf?  \nYour \"soiree\" could have been held any time or are you really just throwing yourself a graduation party? Why isn't your family invited to this? \n\nBTW, your step mother is a selfish shrew.", "NTA your dad should be defending you not encouraging his wife's childish behavior.", "[removed]", "I love that stepmom doesn't have any achievements of her own to try and overshadow OP with so she has to resort to cousins. Not the flex she thinks it is lol", "[removed]", "Oh, my bad, I didn\u2019t see that part", "NTA and as someone with a computer engineering degree, bravo.  That is a hell of a tough masters  to get.", "Congratulations \ud83c\udf8a \n\nNTA \nIt is your time to shine! \nCatching you up on everyone is one thing but to drag it out was wrong of her. \nHer acting upset about the dinner was also wrong. She knew your dad was ok with it and she went out her way to attempt to get him on her side. \nI\u2019m sure all those years of her mental abuse was boiling over. Good for you telling her to back off.", "NTA\n\nAnd why does your father facilitate this nonsense?", "Since the dad wanted to join in I would have told them the reason my cousins are successful is because they have a wonderful dad who would not allow anyone to put them down including his own wife.", "You have a masters and are supposedly jealous of a nurse and someone still partying with their frat brothers?! NTA \n\nCongrats on your achievement. Hopefully in the future you can visit dad on your own and skip socializing with the narcissistic step mom    \n\n\n\\* Nurses have a hard job and I admire them for the dedication, but unless they have a masters in nursing there is no comparison to OP presently IMO.", "NTA, cut contact.", "NTA and congrats \ud83e\udd79", "I am laughing so much at your advanced coping strategies\u2014these are great! My therapist would probably recommend something similar! \ud83d\ude02", "It's not jealousy, it's self-centeredness and a textbook case of underlying narcissism. The OP represents her dad's life pre-her, and she is a person who believes everyone revolves around her life force. We can't say she's a bad person in life because who knows, but she clearly sees OP as an obstacle in getting all the attention she wants from her husband.   \n\n\nOP, you're 24. Speaking from experience, it's okay to severe that relationship. It's as \"easy\" as having a 1-on-1 conversation with your father and being calm but honest from your perspective. Make it plain you're not asking him to choose between you and her, just that you are no longer going to engage because it's clear she's putting your down and it's not worth the grief. You're an adult, and it's a good time for you to go ahead and start having adult conversations with your parents."]}
