He owns 10 rental properties, we live in one of them that he INSISTED we move in to 6 years ago because he was doing something nice for us and he wanted us to live nearby. It\u2019s a beautiful home and in return we pay a small amount of rent, I manage all of his other properties, and we always make ourselves available for whatever he needs. (Moving furniture, appliances, fixing the rental houses, finding applicants, showing properties, etc). I\u2019m not sure how this even happened but basically as soon as we got pregnant he decided to inform us he\u2019s going to raise rent by $1000/month because he believes that we haven\u2019t saved enough money in the past 6 years so he will start saving $1k/month for us\u2026.but with our own money that we pay in rent. \n\nSince I don\u2019t need him to be my savings account for no reason I told him we are moving out. There have been a few other things that have happened recently to strain our relationship but it\u2019s too much to put in here. Basically it has caused me so much stress that anytime he texts or calls I have a mild panic attack because I don\u2019t know what his next ask of us will be. My mom(56F) (they are divorced) thinks im overreacting about this but my husband is 100% supportive of me. I did not invite him to our gender reveal because I know he would bring up the rent or other issues that would cause me stress. Once he found out I didn\u2019t invite him he texted me and told me to get my stuff out of the house by Sunday (it\u2019s Thursday night currently). When I told him no and said I need 30 days his answer was that he would go into our house and start throwing our stuff on the street tomorrow during our gender reveal. I called the police to make sure he could not do that (we don\u2019t have a lease) and changed the locks. We also have a camera at home but I will be very anxious tomorrow.\n\nReddit, I\u2019ve never once been late on bills or rent and I treat this home very well. I do feel bad I didn\u2019t invite him to the gender reveal but I can\u2019t be around him without being on edge.

That is an unlawful eviction.\n\nThis has nothing to do with a gender reveal party.", "NTA he is a control freak and acting so entitled though. He wanted you to live there so he could control you. He lost his mind when you wanted to leave because he can't cope with the idea of you having freedom and not being his slave anymore.", "NTA. Your father sounds very jealous of you having baby. Which sounds extremely odd. I would move out and never lift another finger to help him with any of his properties.", "NAH. He's made a plan for a college fund and then some.

You generally cannot change the locks on a house you rent. He's the owner and Will just have them changed out and there's nothing you can do about it. You do have tenants rights so he just can't throw your stuff out legally. You gave 30 days notice so after 30 days so be it.\n\nNow the act all surprised about showing other properties and such is a stretch. You by your own admission state you pay a small amount of rent. In lieu of that I think you were well aware of the sweat to make up the other portion of rent.\n\nNow, he was wrong for trying to force you to save money by charging you a mere 1k and putting it away for you, your husband and soon to be child but he is correct children start off expensive and only get more expensive, he definitely went about it the wrong way though. In the end, he was trying to look out for your best interest, it was just done the wrong way. Now the question is why. You were child free with little in bills so it wouldn't be uncommon to get a little spend happy. That changes with kids so financially were you prepared or preparing for that or was it status quo?\n\nHe wasn't invited to your reveal and he's hurt by that and no, you weren't all calm about it so words were said on both sides and this is where you're at.", "Thank you, after this I don\u2019t think I will let him be around his grandchild because he is a loose cannon.

I\u2019ve never asked for money, I did not ask to pay less than market rent nor have I asked for money for anything else. For the past 6 years he has insisted we never pay him more as long as I help him with his other properties. I know I shouldn\u2019t have let him talk me into that but honestly it seemed like a great deal, until it wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m honestly not sure if he would give that rent money back if we needed it, he says he would but I don\u2019t trust it.", "I changed the locks because I\u2019m afraid he will enter in the next 30 days without permission and start throwing our stuff out. I will change them back as soon as we leave. In terms of saving money and being prepared for a child\u2026we are prepared and have budgeted but in his eyes it\u2019s not enough, even though he does not have any clue what we have in our checking/saving. I can pay 1k/month but I don\u2019t need him to be our money overseer when I\u2019m almost 30 years old. I\u2019m definitely not surprised by helping him manage the other properties, I\u2019ve always been happy to do it.
