The office staff gets the refill request in the morning from me and send it to clinical staff. They routinely take 8+ hours to process the refill request and send it to the pharmacy. Just today, I called them at 8:15 AM. Fast forward to 4:25 PM and they still have not processed the refill and sent it off. Every time they take forever and a day to send it off.   \n\n\nEven every 90 days, when I take him in for a renewal appointment, they drag their feet. My doctor always sends prescriptions off before he leaves the exam room, but not these people. His last renewal appointment was at 9:30 in the morning, the doctor left the room at 9:56 AM. The pharmacy didn't get the prescription until the following day.  \n\n\nThe excuse is always the same \"clinical staff has the request, they've just been really busy.\" There are ***TEN*** providers in that office that can write a prescription and they ***ALL*** see him and have ***ALL*** written the script before, not just his primary. But yet nobody has the idea to designate one provider to sit down when they come back from lunch and to process the morning refill requests, or to sit down at 4 and process the afternoon ones.  \n\n\n  \nToday when I called a second time, I just went the hell off on the clinical manager. I'm so fed up with the sheer incompetence of that staff as a whole. AITA for doing that?  \n\n\nSide note, to anyone that's going to say \"just change providers\", the only other one in his area (within 60 miles) that takes his insurance is a community health clinic that doesn't do primary care. I can't. \n\n\nEdit: The office will not send a refill order for a controlled substance out until 28 days after the previous refill order. Day 28 was Saturday, the office is closed.\n\nEdit 2: I don't know how everyone came to the conclusion that I'm a woman, but I 100% am not.", "created_utc": 1693255659, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163xkk4/aita_for_absolutely_tearing_into_the_clinical/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do you 100% know they anyone of them actually have the time you\u2019re expecting them to have? \n\nWhy do you have more priority over all the other prescriptions? The other people who are waiting just as long as you. Why do you have the right to scream at someone who\u2019s just doing their job. \n\nIt\u2019s ADHD meds. Not life saving meds. He will not die if he doesn\u2019t have one for a day. The reason it\u2019s so backed could be exactly that. Priority comes to people who could die or get severely worse if they don\u2019t take their meds. And you need to be respectful of that.", "NTA. But tearing into office staff won't make you any friends there and might well slow down the refill process even more if any of them are vindictive types.", "YTA.. there's literally a shortage for these meds and you aren't the only one who's meds are being filled. Your son can wait in line like everyone else it's not like seizure meds.\n\nEdit: I know parents want to hear that their kids are the highest priority but when it comes to actual medication..ADHD meds can wait as it is not a priority compared to other cases this clinic is likely dealing with. ADHD is a schedule 2 controlled substance but it is not a life saving medication or even seizure meds  where missing 1 day leads to a seizure. Sorry, but ADHD is a low priority. And if a parent ever spoke to my staff like that..they wouldn't be allowed in the building. The patient would have to be brought by someone else.", "YTA, If I were a doctor and you spoke to any of my staff the way you describe, you would no longer be my patient.  There are other people in the world besides you and your son.  And if you wait to request refills until you have only two days of medication left, that's on you.", "Honestly, it's literally their job to process prescription requests in a timely manner, especially for critical medications. The repeated incompetence is baffling. You're the patient's advocate, not someone they can push around or procrastinate with. They need to step up and do their job correctly and on time. Who are they to jeopardize your son's health and safety because they can't get their act together? If they can't handle the basic responsibilities of their profession, maybe they're in the wrong line of work. It's high time they get their priorities straight and stop making weak excuses. If this is how they treat all their patients, it's a miracle they're still in business. You have every right to be livid. YTA for losing your temper, but they're the bigger AHs for consistent negligence.", "You may not have a choice when it comes to changing providers, our office has fired more than one patient when they or their parents became abusive (as defined by raising your voice, yelling or tearing into a staff member. What is their policy on refills? 24 hours? Is there a reason why the prescription can not be refilled automatically? If you need to go into the office for a refill visit, can you make those appointments a couple days earlier? If the staff is busy, they are busy. Clearly you think they should stop everything for you. Many offices do refills at the end of the day meaning the pharmacy won\u2019t have it until the next morning.

He also has Autism so he has lots of medications.  The ADHD is the ONLY one he can pick and choose when he needs to take it. He has also been on every different type/variety of medications offered in this class. Going cold turkey for this class of drugs is an absolute ridiculous belief. Not a thing. Also, the LAW allows you to refill FIVE days before using last pill at pharmacy. Ergo, you can request refill from doctors a week before hand.  You can give said prescription to the pharmacy. They will hold it until they can legally can fill which again is FIVE days BEFORE your son runs out. There is NO reason you should ever be out of these meds (except nationally there is a severe shortage of these meds)!!  Most doctors who prescribe these meds usually require 24hours to 5days as policy!!!

I worked at a pediatrician office as the nurse who answered phone for things like prescription.  I was shocked at the number of call that came in. My kids woke up sick. He needs to come in. When did he wake up. 10 minutes ago. My baby poops every day.  Yesterday at 1pm. What time is it now 1:05 pm. About 30 calls a month. I need note for my kid to not take swimming in school. Why. She doesn't want to get wet. Literally 150 calls a day easily", "NTA, it really does sound like incompetence.\n\nBut can you ask for the refill the day before you need it?", "ESH I understand the frustration, but if what they are not working for you, then you have to figure out what YOU need to do to better manage the system you get to work within. Calling a script refill in a day or two earlier would be a better system than day of. \n\nWe make sure to call in a refill for our son's ADHD meds about 5 days before we need it, just to make sure it gets processed in time.  Ours is on Focalin, he only utilizes the medication during the school day, or if there is an event he knows he needs to be focused for, it's often that he does not take it on the weekends.", "INFO: Why should they change their routine just to fill your prescription early? Just because it's more convenient for you?", "YTA. anytime you\u2019re getting less then 24 hour turnaround on a refill your PCP office is doing quality work. You yelling at staff will probably assure that you will not get your script filled one second earlier then the time they are required to do it. Good luck.", "YTA - why are you leaving his med refills to the last possible second? A 24 hour turn around for meds is not unreasonable.", "If the window for filling is starting Saturday, then call on Friday so they have the request in the office and can send it in on Monday morning. Don't wait until Monday, because it will take until at least Tuesday before they can get around to it. When you leave your message on the prescription line, acknowledge that you know they cant send it until Monday, but since that will be day 30, you are making the request so they can address it first thing Monday. They also might be willing to send it on Friday with a refill date on Saturday. You need to process your frustration before trying to communicate with staff. Acting Karenish will not get you to your goal. Kindness will. YTA", "Maybe you should get the prescription refilled before 90 days so you are not in a dire situation.  Many insurances allow 90 day refills to be filled after about 70 days.\n\nAnd pissing off the staff won't move you to the top of the list.  Instead, it will likely not make you a priority.  Better to ask them how you can get it moved along faster, in a polite manner, of course.", "[deleted]", "YTA as someone with adhd that one day wait isnt gonna hurt him.  However you also have the option of refilling a few days earlier.  It doesnt have to be right at the last pill.", "Info- my insurance allows me to refill a prescription like a week before I\u2019m due to run out, so why are you waiting until the day you need it? Does your pharmacy have automatic refills?", "Yta.  I work in a doctors office.  Controlled substance have to be sent by a provider.  As a nurse, I can sent most meds, but not controlled ones.  I have no control over when a provider gets to it.  Furthermore, the providers aren\u2019t sitting around.  They see patients all day.  The patients in the office come before refill requests.  Being an asshole to staff isn\u2019t going to get your refills faster.  In fact, they will likely get slower in their responses.  Our office policy is 26 days for controlled substance refill requests but we do make exceptions when people are respectful and have a legitimate reason to need it early.  For example, we have a patient who goes to college in another state and can only pick up his medication on a weekend.", "YTA, I don\u2019t know if you realize how many healthcare professionals either got long Covid, died or are severely overworked because of the pandemic? Expecting a refill for meds within 12 hours is incredible, that\u2019s not normal. Here it takes a day and a half and that\u2019s really, really fast. Yelling at overworked and underpaid people will not make them help you faster. Make sure you have a weeks worth of meds before ordering a new batch. That way, you can\u2019t run out.", "Just want to say I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having all the trouble. I have a family member who will need an opioid pain med forever and getting the prescription refilled is a major headache and usually involves gaps in medication which produce a fair amount of suffering. They are conscientious and responsible, and can\u2019t do anything more on their part to facilitate refills, but the rules about controlled substances and Idk-what-else have made it impossible. It\u2019s awful to feel powerless. I just had a severe illness and was prescribed a medicine to facilitate breathing, of all frivolous things, but it took more than 3 days for the pharmacy to get the prescription. I don\u2019t know what pressures and constraints the offices and pharmacies are under, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to help anything to go off on them, but I sympathize with your frustration and difficulties.", "NTA.\n\nOur health care system sucks. \n\nIt's bullshit you have to go through all these hoops so your child can have needed medication. \n\nI totally get your frustration.", "YTA\nWith that many providers how many patients do you think they have?

I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ve told you to give 3 business days for refills.

I understand your frustration with this.  The Clinic is horrible for not even taking a refill for an ADHD medication until 2 days before the old RX is finished.  If they have this rule they need to get the RX to the pharmacy on the day you call. This can lead to issues for the child and the Clinic is the one causing this, not the parents. \n\nMy daughter has been on Foclin XR since she was 5 she is now 20.  Her doctor's office as a child had a 7-day rule. Call 7 days before a refill is needed to start the refill process, they usually send the refill to the pharmacy within 24-48 hours. The pharmacy would hold the RX until it was time to fill,  which was usually 2 days before she ran out of meds. \n\nNow that she is an adult she goes in to see her doctor every 90 days and they send 3 months of RX's to the pharmacy with a doctor's note as to when to fill.
