The office staff gets the refill request in the morning from me and send it to clinical staff. They routinely take 8+ hours to process the refill request and send it to the pharmacy. Just today, I called them at 8:15 AM. Fast forward to 4:25 PM and they still have not processed the refill and sent it off. Every time they take forever and a day to send it off.\n\nEven every 90 days, when I take him in for a renewal appointment, they drag their feet. My doctor always sends prescriptions off before he leaves the exam room, but not these people. His last renewal appointment was at 9:30 in the morning, the doctor left the room at 9:56 AM. The pharmacy didn't get the prescription until the following day.\n\nThe excuse is always the same \"clinical staff has the request, they've just been really busy.\" There are ***TEN*** providers in that office that can write a prescription and they ***ALL*** see him and have ***ALL*** written the script before, not just his primary. But yet nobody has the idea to designate one provider to sit down when they come back from lunch and to process the morning refill requests, or to sit down at 4 and process the afternoon ones.\n\nToday when I called a second time, I just went the hell off on the clinical manager. I'm so fed up with the sheer incompetence of that staff as a whole. AITA for doing that?\n\nSide note, to anyone that's going to say \"just change providers\", the only other one in his area (within 60 miles) that takes his insurance is a community health clinic that doesn't do primary care. I can't.\n\nEdit: The office will not send a refill order for a controlled substance out until 28 days after the previous refill order. Day 28 was Saturday, the office is closed.\n\nEdit 2: I don't know how everyone came to the conclusion that I'm a woman, but I 100% am not.  \n\n\nEdit 3: Results are in, overwhelming I'm the asshole, though most of those votes either didn't read the entire post before making that decision, or they misunderstood the context given of what led up to it and who I laid into.  \n\n\nSo a few last things to clarify. I can't call it in more than two days early, see edit 1. They will tell me to call back when there are two days left.  \nAs I stated in the initial post, this is not a new issue. It has been going on for nearly a year. I have repeatedly, calmly, complained to the very same clinical manager that I laid into today about the issue and nothing has ever been done about it.  \nThe clinical manager is **not** an office staff member, they are one of the providers in the practice and have the authority to send the refill order themselves.  \nIt should not take 24-72 hours for you to get a script sent off, that is not acceptable and you should not accept it from your doctor. I am livid on behalf of all of you who have gone through that and think it's okay.", "created_utc": 1693255659, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163xkk4/aita_for_absolutely_tearing_into_the_clinical/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He will not die if he doesn\u2019t have one for a day. The reason it\u2019s so backed could be exactly that. Priority comes to people who could die or get severely worse if they don\u2019t take their meds. And you need to be respectful of that.", "NTA.

Your son can wait in line like everyone else it's not like seizure meds.\n\nEdit: I know parents want to hear that their kids are the highest priority but when it comes to actual medication..ADHD meds can wait as it is not a priority compared to other cases this clinic is likely dealing with. ADHD is a schedule 2 controlled substance but it is not a life saving medication or even seizure meds  where missing 1 day leads to a seizure. Sorry, but ADHD is a low priority. And if a parent ever spoke to my staff like that..they wouldn't be allowed in the building. The patient would have to be brought by someone else.", "YTA, If I were a doctor and you spoke to any of my staff the way you describe, you would no longer be my patient.  There are other people in the world besides you and your son.  And if you wait to request refills until you have only two days of medication left, that's on you.", "Honestly, it's literally their job to process prescription requests in a timely manner, especially for critical medications. The repeated incompetence is baffling. You're the patient's advocate, not someone they can push around or procrastinate with. They need to step up and do their job correctly and on time. Who are they to jeopardize your son's health and safety because they can't get their act together? If they can't handle the basic responsibilities of their profession, maybe they're in the wrong line of work. It's high time they get their priorities straight and stop making weak excuses. If this is how they treat all their patients, it's a miracle they're still in business. You have every right to be livid. YTA for losing your temper, but they're the bigger AHs for consistent negligence.", "You may not have a choice when it comes to changing providers, our office has fired more than one patient when they or their parents became abusive (as defined by raising your voice, yelling or tearing into a staff member. What is their policy on refills? 24 hours? Is there a reason why the prescription can not be refilled automatically? If you need to go into the office for a refill visit, can you make those appointments a couple days earlier? If the staff is busy, they are busy. Clearly you think they should stop everything for you. Many offices do refills at the end of the day meaning the pharmacy won\u2019t have it until the next morning.

He also has Autism so he has lots of medications.  The ADHD is the ONLY one he can pick and choose when he needs to take it. He has also been on every different type/variety of medications offered in this class. Going cold turkey for this class of drugs is an absolute ridiculous belief. Not a thing. Also, the LAW allows you to refill FIVE days before using last pill at pharmacy. Ergo, you can request refill from doctors a week before hand.  You can give said prescription to the pharmacy. They will hold it until they can legally can fill which again is FIVE days BEFORE your son runs out. There is NO reason you should ever be out of these meds (except nationally there is a severe shortage of these meds)!!  Most doctors who prescribe these meds usually require 24hours to 5days as policy!!!

I worked at a pediatrician office as the nurse who answered phone for things like prescription.  I was shocked at the number of call that came in. My kids woke up sick. He needs to come in. When did he wake up. 10 minutes ago. My baby poops every day.  Yesterday at 1pm. What time is it now 1:05 pm. About 30 calls a month. I need note for my kid to not take swimming in school. Why.

Literally 150 calls a day easily", "NTA, it really does sound like incompetence.\n\nBut can you ask for the refill the day before you need it?", "ESH I understand the frustration, but if what they are not working for you, then you have to figure out what YOU need to do to better manage the system you get to work within. Calling a script refill in a day or two earlier would be a better system than day of. \n\nWe make sure to call in a refill for our son's ADHD meds about 5 days before we need it, just to make sure it gets processed in time.  Ours is on Focalin, he only utilizes the medication during the school day, or if there is an event he knows he needs to be focused for, it's often that he does not take it on the weekends.", "INFO: Why should they change their routine just to fill your prescription early?

A 24 hour turn around for meds is not unreasonable.", "If the window for filling is starting Saturday, then call on Friday so they have the request in the office and can send it in on Monday morning. Don't wait until Monday, because it will take until at least Tuesday before they can get around to it. When you leave your message on the prescription line, acknowledge that you know they cant send it until Monday, but since that will be day 30, you are making the request so they can address it first thing Monday. They also might be willing to send it on Friday with a refill date on Saturday. You need to process your frustration before trying to communicate with staff. Acting Karenish will not get you to your goal. Kindness will. YTA", "Maybe you should get the prescription refilled before 90 days so you are not in a dire situation.  Many insurances allow 90 day refills to be filled after about 70 days.\n\nAnd pissing off the staff won't move you to the top of the list.  Instead, it will likely not make you a priority.

Does your pharmacy have automatic refills?", "Yta.  I work in a doctors office.  Controlled substance have to be sent by a provider.  As a nurse, I can sent most meds, but not controlled ones.  I have no control over when a provider gets to it.  Furthermore, the providers aren\u2019t sitting around.  They see patients all day.  The patients in the office come before refill requests.  Being an asshole to staff isn\u2019t going to get your refills faster.  In fact, they will likely get slower in their responses.  Our office policy is 26 days for controlled substance refill requests but we do make exceptions when people are respectful and have a legitimate reason to need it early.  For example, we have a patient who goes to college in another state and can only pick up his medication on a weekend.", "YTA, I don\u2019t know if you realize how many healthcare professionals either got long Covid, died or are severely overworked because of the pandemic? Expecting a refill for meds within 12 hours is incredible, that\u2019s not normal. Here it takes a day and a half and that\u2019s really, really fast. Yelling at overworked and underpaid people will not make them help you faster. Make sure you have a weeks worth of meds before ordering a new batch. That way, you can\u2019t run out.", "Just want to say I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having all the trouble. I have a family member who will need an opioid pain med forever and getting the prescription refilled is a major headache and usually involves gaps in medication which produce a fair amount of suffering. They are conscientious and responsible, and can\u2019t do anything more on their part to facilitate refills, but the rules about controlled substances and Idk-what-else have made it impossible. It\u2019s awful to feel powerless. I just had a severe illness and was prescribed a medicine to facilitate breathing, of all frivolous things, but it took more than 3 days for the pharmacy to get the prescription.

I understand your frustration with this.  The Clinic is horrible for not even taking a refill for an ADHD medication until 2 days before the old RX is finished.  If they have this rule they need to get the RX to the pharmacy on the day you call. This can lead to issues for the child and the Clinic is the one causing this, not the parents. \n\nMy daughter has been on Foclin XR since she was 5 she is now 20.  Her doctor's office as a child had a 7-day rule. Call 7 days before a refill is needed to start the refill process, they usually send the refill to the pharmacy within 24-48 hours.

They should have given leeway with Friday if the 28th day was Saturday. \n\nIf yours can tolerate it and doc is ok with it, maybe don't give it on weekends. I give my son his mainly on school days or if he has something to really focus on during the weekend, he's been home sick today so no need today. It gives a bit more leeway with the fills. Son handles it ok and doc is ok with us doing it this way, so I'm aware this may not work for you, just an idea to alleviate some of the stress\n\nNo judgement cause dealing with ADHD and docs can be very stressful", "INFO\n\n\n>Even every 90 days, when I take him in for a renewal appointment, they drag their feet.\n\nand \n\n>The office will not send a refill order for a controlled substance out until 28 days after the previous refill order. Day 28 was Saturday, the office is closed\n\nSo there's a 62 day gap between the minimum waiting period and the 90 day \"last minute.\" Why are you fixated on the office being closed on day 28, when you could take him from days 29 through 89?", "NTA They did this to my husband. There is no excuse. They know that it's controlled substance on a deadline, but they really don't give an F about patients running out. Anybody telling you  Y.  T.  A. must have their relative as a doctor.", "My doctors send prescriptions in electronically before I even leave the exam room. \n\nThey're usually filled by the time I get the pharmacy. I'd say NTA. Your doctors office needs to get with the times.", "NTA", "Plain and simple, you don't understand how the office works and you don't understand how your insurance and state manages controlled substances. Yta", "Why are refill requests taking so long? A brand-new prescription gets sent over almost instantaneously. I've never waited that long.", "With my doctor a prescription for codeine cough syrup will arrive at the pharmacy before I can drive there. It\u2019s 2023 and we have these things called \u201ccomputers\u201d and \u201cthe internet\u201d.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason any staff besides the person writing the prescription needs to be involved at the clinic. The doctor puts it directly into the computer, the computer sends it directly to the pharmacy of choice.", "24h is terrible!?? My dr here (Qu\u00e9bec, canada) just sends it directly to my pharmacy who usually has it ready in the next couple hours... NTA even 24h is a horrible delay.", "I'm taking a seizure medication off label as a mood stabilizer. The info packet says if abruptly stopped it can cause seizures even in people without epilepsy. I've had to go multiple days without, multiple times because the pharmacy just didn't have any and were waiting for their supply to come in. While extremely frustrating (and a teensy tiny bit scary with the whole seizure bit), I know it's not their fault and there is literally NOTHING they can do about it. And every time this has occurred the pharmacist/techs sound just as frustrated by the situation.", "My first thought was\u2026you\u2019re gonna get a dismissal letter in the mail. Maybe OP will be kinder to the next pediatrician. I usually call for a refill when I am down to 7 day supply. This is for routine, not ADHD meds.", "You can prescribe medication as a nurse??", "I tried that late last year when dealing with CVS being a shitty pharmacy. Called the doctor for a refill when he had eight days left, they told me to call back in six days and request it.", "The clinical manager is not office staff, they are one of the ten providers at that office, and they can authorize the refill themselves.  \n\n\nI also have had this issue for months, and have repeatedly complained to that very same clinical manager about it.", "Also agree with you. I take a controlled substance that has horrible withdrawal and a very limited window of prescription renewal. I've also been completely screwed over by offices that couldn't seem to grasp this and would take off on vacation/long weekends without renewing my prescription on time...even with a prompt from me.", "This office is a sub office of a larger practice. The same practice my PCP is in. I tried to change him a few months ago because the larger practice thought all of their clincians were covered. We found out they weren't, it was just the ten providers in that sub office.\n\nAllegedly they're working on a new contract for all of their providers to accept it. If they do, I'm changing him over to my doctor. Never had this issue with him,  or his staff.", "I can, a lot of them either didn't read it all, or misunderstood who I laid into.", "Right? I don't get why these guys aren't sending scrips right away.", "Precisely. \"The doctor\" is the hard part, as doctors are busy with consults and procedures during the day. When you are actively at the consult and get prescribed something, then yes, the prescription can be sent straight away. When it's a refill request, you have to wait until the doctors are done with the daily consults before they can review the prescription requests.", "As someone on the same meds, it is incredibly frustrating. The hoops that one must jump through can be incredibly overwhelming. \n\nBut yeah. OP needs to begin planning ahead. Schedule that appointment two days earlier. (I believe most pharmacies and insurance co's allow a 24 to 48 hour period for early refill typically.) And perhaps plan a few drug holidays a month to build a back up supply.", "If you order a refill every 28 days (and obviously getting a 30 day supply), every month you are 2 more days ahead. \n\nSo if you get it in 28 days you have a a 2 day buffer. Get it in another 28 days and you have a 4 say buffer. And again in 28 days you have a 6 day buffer. Then even if it falls on a weekend you won't be without. \n\nWork WITH the clinic, not against.", "Probably because they are seeing scheduled patients.", ">(I believe most pharmacies and insurance co's allow a 24 to 48 hour period for early refill typically.)\n\nNot for controlled meds usually tbh.", "My pharmacy has just started getting my son\u2019s concerta back in stock. He takes the generic but I was relieved, I almost cried happy tears. Just in time for freshman year. I fought so hard to find it in May for his testing.", "Yeah, I've been taking a stimulant daily for years for fatigue from my autoimmune disease. I've missed days because my husband couldn't get to the pharmacy to pick up my script, the pharmacy was out and they weren't able to get more for a day or two, I needed to change my sleep schedule,etc.\n\nMy dosage has already been increased once so I don't want to ask for another increase until absolutely necessary; with the way it is with opiods and stimulants I don't want to not be able to get a script because someone, somewhere decided I must be drug seeking or an addict. My insurance has already said that I've hit my lifetime amount on Tramadol and will no longer cover it. Which is fucking ridiculous because I get a 30 day supply once, maybe twice a year. \n\nSo when I feel like my stimulant isn't helping much because my body gained tolerance to that dosage, I skip it for a few days to a week. Kind of reset my body. All that has ever happened is I'm way more tired for however long I skip it. That's it. \n\nHell, I've had multiple medications that you REALLY shouldn't miss a dose and yet I've had to. Pharmaceuticals have had MASSIVE supply chain issues and shortages the last couple of years. But unlike OP, I recognize that there's nothing the doctors or pharmacies can do about it and that they are just as frustrated as their patients. Probably more when they have people like OP calling and screaming at them.", "I mean, they\u2019re closed. He cannot bend time.", "My pharmacy does allow it. And the dea most certainly does. The only part I am uncertain of is their particular pharmacy. In which case... find a new one. \n\nNot easy with the shortage. But even if that aint possible, the issue here is the doctor. Not the pharmacist. So scheduling the appointment with some buffer shouldn't be an issue.", "I work in addiction medicine, I also prescribe stimulants.  OP is ridiculous, the majority of my patients miss doses.  Many don\u2019t dose on weekends or days where they aren\u2019t at school or work.  Stimulant withdrawal is quite benign compared to alcohol, benzos, or opiates.  It does not require medical monitoring or management.  OP has some anger issues and needs to chill.  If it were me, OP would have immediately received a warning that if he ever verbally abused any of my clinic staff again, care will be terminated.  Healthcare workers deal with an insane amount of abuse, outpatient clinics don\u2019t have to tolerate it at all.", "If CVS gets my script early and it can\u2019t be filled yet, they hold it and fill it when it can be filled. This isn\u2019t that difficult. Look ahead in your calendar- give the office staff a call a few days ahead of time for the refill that\u2019s due over the weekend. \n\nOr ask the doctor for an extra 5 pills since you can\u2019t seem to figure out how to request your kids meds correctly and you are convinced they need to be medicated nonstop which is really just not accurate. But you do you.", "Most providers no longer use paper scripts for these meds due to the high rate of abuse. There have been federal and state laws out in place to prevent script sharing and parents using their kids meds. The state I live in requires patients to bring their pills in for counting by provider at random intervals, to make sure they\u2019re not using more than prescribed. Just info - not accusing you.", "It usually depends on the insurance company.  Mine allows refills on controlled substances after 24 days.  28 days is more normal and a few do not allow anything earlier than 30 days.", "On Schedule II drugs? That's unusual.", "Many clinics see fairly complex cases and issues with serious implications. There is prioritization at play. \n\nSometimes you gotta wait until the doc is doing all the leftover stuff at the end of the day. Usually way outside their scheduled hours.", "They can't dispense 35, it's a controlled substance. As for the rest... Did you read the comment you responded to? Because I accepted fault for not calling Friday to see if they'd send it a day early.", "I wouldn't mind doing that.", "Yes. It has never been an issue for me. Though I have been careful to cultivate a good relationship with all involved. Only time I ever freaked out was when refill day occurred the same day as multiple college finals and I repeatedly explained I couldn't fuck about. Got there. \"We need prior auth. Also we are out of that med.\" \n\nT-3 hours to my calc exam.\n\nI managed to get it sorted rapidly. But in the process multiple feels were hurt. (And subsequently soothed)\n\nThat particular time I actually asked the lady on the insurance company line to speak with her manager. She sounded really upset about it but did. And I told them that she had resolved a chronic issue I had been confused about and had been extremely professional in the face of my tirade. I figured I had time while the prescription was actually being filled to be a nice person. They ended up bringing multiple other people on the line including the original support person (with my permission) and asked me to repeat what I said. \n\nShe cried. (Happy tears.)\n\nI've been on the same meds since the 90s. \n\nRegardless, as I said, the limiting factor above is not the pharmacy but the doctor. So the solution is making the appointment earlier. Even if the pharmacy won't fill early the doctor can perform the exam early to make sure the scrip can be filled in time.", "1.  Webmd is not a scholarly source.  2.  Focalin does not carry any serious black box warnings for suicide.  3.  People who are ADDICTED may experience some mood swings or depression with withdrawal (although typically not severe).  If your child is not addicted to the medication, there is literally zero risk of any sort of severe issues from missing doses.  Nice try though OP.", "Bull. I'm on that ***exact same*** medication and have been for over a decade. First of all, that medication wears off extremely fast (and by fast, I mean if you take it around breakfast time, it'll be totally out of your system by late afternoon or so). Additionally, since it can be a pain to refill, I mainly take it on days that I really need to focus, which usually translates to work days. Most notably, I didn't take it for about a month and a half during summer vacation, and the only side effect was my being slightly more spacey than usual. Sure, plenty of medications can cause those sorts of side effects, and I'm not saying you shouldn't keep an eye out for them, but being off Focalin XR for a day or two while technicalities get worked out is *nothing to worry about*. YTA. \n\nP.S. Assuming you're in the United States, consider looking into Good RX. You can get coupons to use when picking up your Focalin XR for a fraction of the uninsured price.", "OP is terribly misinformed.  There are no stimulants that have to be taken every day or that have severe withdrawal symptoms.  I\u2019m almost starting to wonder if OP is the one taking the meds and perhaps they have a little problem.  Their obsession with not missing a dose is quite bizarre.", "I\u2019ve had to learn how to work the system too. And I\u2019ve been doing it for a long freaking time now. They can dispense any number that is written. Script is 1 per day? Ok cool-he ups it for one month to 1.5/day. Magic- now you have an extra 15 even though you definitely can take days off and be completely fine.\n\nThey can also send it over early and it won\u2019t be filled. Or you can call a few days early letting them know the refill is coming up. I cannot believe that the rule of thumb for their refill requests is only one business day let alone half of one. These guys know what they are doing, have more work than you can imagine, and honestly are likely not fond of you calling the day of, for an entire year. \n\nGood luck with all this since you seem to have all the information already.", "It isn\u2019t just a hassle for the patient. You get a random phone call to bring the bottle in within 48 hours. That\u2019s a pain, but then the office also has to do the counting assessment for the state - for every patient taking ADHD stimulants.", "I mean, it's usually not about your relationship, it's about the law.", "Is the dosage such that if you take multiple of the lower dosage it will add up to the dosage you normally  take? Not sure if that would be allowed since it's a controlled substance. I'm on a med that I'm supposed to take 450mg/day. But my insurance won't cover a single 450mg tablet. So my GP writes a script for 300mg and 150mg and I just take both together. For whatever reason my insurance WILL cover that.", "Not everyone reacts to coming off medication the same way. \n\nI'm glad you haven't had a negative experience, but your experience does not determine the experiences of others.\n\n\nOn the price, I pay $5/refill. But I appreciate the heads up on potential savings.", "I work 3 minutes from the office and I leave just before they open. Wouldn't be a hassle for me, it's on the way home.\n\nI can see how it would be anmoying for most people though.", "If the law in your jurisdiction is more strict than I have described, that is either a local difference from mine that is not due to federal law or something that has changed since the shortage began. I switched pharmacists and no longer am so concerned about filling early. (My ex had been stealing my meds. She is no longer relevant. So I am less pressed to fill as early as possible.)\n\nIn general, 2 day windows have always been the norm for me."]}
