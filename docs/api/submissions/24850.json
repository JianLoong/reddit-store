We are both married and have 4 year old children. Jack and his wife Mae + kiddo are staying with us as we live in a popular holiday destination by the beach. \n\nI like Mae a lot, I always have, but she has very strict ideas about how she does things with regards to her child, which is fine, except she gets annoyed when people around her don\u2019t do the same. On more than one occasion I\u2019ve had to remind her that my child is not hers and neither am I and I will do as I see fit. \n\nTwo days ago at breakfast Mae suggested we take the kids to the zoo. I politely declined because firstly, I hate zoos, and second because I wanted to go into town, run some errands, and do some shopping, and I was planning to take kiddo with me. I told Mae this and said she was welcome to come with us or take one of our cars to the zoo, whichever she preferred. Mae said she was sure my daughter would much rather go to the zoo. I said that might be true, but the zoo isn\u2019t going anywhere and she will be fine spending the day with me. Mae then said it would be boring for a child to be dragged around doing grown up stuff all day and that as a mother why am I not willing to make sacrifices for my daughter? I was about to reply when Jack jumped in and said \u201cbecause maybe she still wants to be a human being and have something to talk about when her daughter goes to bed. Having a child and a personality isn\u2019t illegal\u201d. Mae snapped back that she was trying to be a good mother and give her child good  memories and Jack said that was fine but Mae shouldn\u2019t push that on me. Mae said she was just saying she finds it sad that I don\u2019t put my time into my daughter, so Jack said \u201cI\u2019m sure she finds all your Mary Poppins sh*t really f*cking boring but she\u2019s got manners and doesn\u2019t say anything so would you just give it a rest\u201d. I have never felt so awkward in my life. Mae kept looking at me like she thought I was going to say something but I was just there like, no I\u2019m not getting involved in this. Eventually my husband came out of his office and we all pretended the argument hadn\u2019t happened. \n\nI saw Mae later in the day and I could see she\u2019d been crying. She went off on me for not defending her when Jack was saying all those things, saying I wasn\u2019t a \u201cgirls girl\u201d and as a mother I should have stuck up for her. I wasn\u2019t going to argue with her since she\u2019d clearly had an awful day so I just said I was sorry she and Jack were going through a rough time and that it wasn\u2019t my intention to be the cause of any friction. \n\nShe\u2019s now giving me the cold shoulder, and making a point of making her own \u201cchild friendly\u201d plans since I prefer to have \u201cadult time\u201d. I don\u2019t think I was wrong for not jumping in because first, that was not my fight and two, Jack wasn\u2019t wrong.

Doesn't seem like Mae would have dropped it without someone being that direct though.", "NTA\n\nThere\u2019s obviously something deeper going on between Mae and Jack, definitely not your place to jump in. Also, Mae was insulting your parenting, so how does she expect you to stick up for her in that situation? \u201cNo jack, Mae is right. I am a selfish mother!\u201d \n\nSecondly, kids don\u2019t always have to be doing child-centered activities. Spending quality time with your child is important, even if every minute isn\u2019t a kid activity. My mom passed when I was 6, and some of my favorite memories with her are driving around with music blasting, running errands. Your child will remember spending time with you, not seeing some animals at the zoo. \n\nI do think it\u2019s worthwhile to have a conversation with Mae, and tell her how you feel by her comments about your parenting. You don\u2019t have to deal with that!", "NTA. That must've been awkward AF. Sounds like Mae is coming from a position of jealousy as well. Jack is a bit of the AH here, to have flipped out on his wife like that in front of you. And trust me, neither of your kids are going to remember this day when they're 21, so the \"making memories\" line is a bit of BS. Just because you're a mom doesn't mean you no longer exist.

She's respun the situation to put herself as the victim, and the icing on the toxic cake is the passive aggressive behaviour afterwards.  She's trying to punish you by making the holiday awkward until you give her a grovelling apology and agree to all her family orientated plans. Definitely NTA", "NTA. The fact that her husband jumped in so \"vigorously\" signals to me that there are bigger, longer-term issues happening between the two of them, probably related to the pushiness that she was demonstrating in her convo with you.", "NTA\n\nMae appears to have self confidence issues one way or the other.

Good for you! \nThen Jack seemingly continued some fight they\u2019ve been having privately. I wouldn\u2019t touch that with a ten foot pole. Good call again.\nAnd finally, she has the nerve to blame you for not sticking up for her? When she was being cruel to you? If you were to stick up for any woman and mother it should be you. You sound like a good mom. \nYour kid is 4, they can have fun at the zoo and the grocery store. Some of my favorite memories with my mom were doing normal mundane activities, but my mom made them fun.

When he saw her browbeating you, again, he called her out in the moment. What has she said or done to acknowledge your rights to make parenting choices that she disrespected with her attacks to violate the boundaries you set and make you change to her way? All I see is her blaming others for her discomfort when people react to her intrusive, devaling, persistent attacks on others' autonomy. Cloaking her intrusive controlling behavior in \"being a mom\" doesn't make it any more acceptable.", "Sounds as if Mae has made motherhood her entire personality, and Jack is tired of it all.

You have no control over what your children will and will not remember, and for most of us the most memorable occasions are ones of joy and connection, not mandatory fun at a theme park. \n\nMae needs to put down the 'being a mum is my whole identity' nonsense. I'm old now, and this seems to be a weird modern trend- you can't just be a parent to your children, you have to devote every waking moment to an Instagram-perfect version of childhood and family.

Sounds like Mae is quite pushy and judgmental of other parenting styles and that's caused some tension in her marriage.

Bet you she actually wanted time to get into your daughter's head. \n\nI do think you should excuse yourself next time though... this isn't the last fight they'll have.", "The only reason I could see OP being kind of an AH in this situation is because Mae and Jack are just visiting\u2026 so while she offered the car to the zoo, it would be nice to do activities with your guests instead of leaving them to do errands all day. Obviously errands must be done, but if the guests aren\u2019t there for long, going to touristy things like the zoo for one day during a visit from out of town guests is a nice thing to do\n\nObviously this changes depending on how long they are staying and if they are using OP for accommodations or if they came to visit OP and husband specifically.", "Mae has centered her entire personality and life towards catering to a 4yo and it\u2019s driving Jack up a wall is what it sounds like.

I mean, I don't have kids, so I'm likely talking out of my ass, but life isn't about being catered to and entertained at all times \u2013\u00a0eventually, you have to learn to entertain yourself. Parents have to run errands and they often have to bring their kids along for the ride, some of it will be fun and some of it will be boring as hell. Such is life.", "I have photos of my kids helping me shred documents when they were about 3.

Let me side with the bully and shut down my friend whose standing up for me? Wtf??", "I think it is also important to point out that OP is NOT on vacation like Mae and Jack. OP lives in the popular beach destination. So no need to spend the days like Mae wants; Mae is on vacation, OP isn't. Hence the plan to run errands and the true statement of \"the zoo will be still be there another day\".", "[removed]", "I still treasure the times when I was a kid when my dad would pick me up after school and we\u2019d go get sodas from the gas station and then run errands :)", "Yeah I agree with this. Mae is in the wrong and very rude but the way Jack was talking to her was pretty harsh and it puts everyone else in an awkward spot. That is not how you treat your partner, especially in front of others. \n\nOP seemed to be handling the conversation well and Jack didn't need to take this moment to put down his wife. I could be projecting but my dad berates my mom all the time and often when my mom and I fight, he jumps in and just rips into her. And it's awkward because even when she's genuinely unreasonable, all I want is just for her to back off and not to be shamed or berated.  That's not to say Jack has to agree with his wife but setting firm but kind boundaries when necessary and having private conversations between the two of them is a much better way. Even if there are real issues, Jack's comments are not productive and they were meant to hurt. They both came off as emotionally immature to me, and Jack actually came off worse than Mae. Mae sounds insufferable but Jack was cruel. \n\nOP is NTA and was really diplomatic throughout, but both Mae and Jack are AHs. And they need marriage counseling or something.", "He was also more than implying that his own wife doesn't have a personality. Like, WTF. Why is he married to her if he dislikes her so much? Husband and wife both sound confrontational and rude.", "He also basically signed OP's name on a bunch of gripes that were clearly from him? Like oh, \"*OP* thinks you don't have a personality, *OP* is sick of your Mary Poppins schtick.\"\n\nI'd be pissed at both of them.", "My impression was this is a recurring issue and possibly something he\u2019s been on the other end of as well - OP said Mae was mum shaming but it could easily be parent shaming and Mae was making as much of a dig at Jake as she was a OP.", "I'm sure he is. Of course for every mother I've met who's done. Something similar is a partner who doesn't really pull the load enough for her to even be able to step back. I have one kid and it's really hard to balance things even with partner who pulls their weight and is willing to take things off your plate in terms of kid rearing.", "Spending time doesn't mean they have to be stuck together like gum to a shoe. Plus she had stuff to do, her life can't be put on hold to please this woman's (entitled) demands and ideas of what a \"good mom\" should be or do", "The best house guests balance their time so that they see their hosts, but are not always underfoot. Spending the entire time together is not the best thing, in most cases.", "Okay. Then it\u2019s something to discuss privately. Not swear at someone in front of others. Doesn\u2019t make it acceptable.", "That could be because Jake is an uninvolved father though. Mae was being an AH during both interactions with OP, but no decent person speaks to their OH like that in front of others. It would be vicious enough even in private.", "Yeah that's true.  Jack does sound like an asshat picking this fight in public, I wouldn't be surprised in the least to find out he's a shit dad.", "The wife started the conversation and insults - why should he move it to a private conversation?", "nta. Is May a freaking idiot. How is it adult time when you were taking your daughter with you.  now if you had let your daughter go with mae then maybe she could complain but what the F is her problem", "> She went off on me for not defending her when Jack was saying all those things, saying I wasn\u2019t a \u201cgirls girl\u201d and as a mother I should have stuck up for her.\n\nNTA. This was an argument between a couple. You stayed quiet because you knew you had no business interfering. She doesn\u2019t get automatic backup for her side of things just because you\u2019re a woman.", "NTA . Women who make being mothers to be their  whole identity are plain annoying and boring . Her husband is obviously had enough of the baby proof life and the whole thing is not your business", "NTA.  She was criticizing your parenting because you chose to take your child on errands instead of going to the zoo?  You live in that town, right?  You can go to the zoo anytime. She is a controlling, judgmental a-hole to try guilting you into doing what SHE wants. \n\nI don't see where you jumped into their argument.  You were defending your own plans.  This woman is not a friend.", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t your argument.", "NTA. Why would you defend her after she\u2019s basically called you a bad mom? \n\nShe\u2019s on holiday, of course she has time to do lots of kid friendly activities. You still have your life to live, which involves things like errands and shopping. She\u2019s the ah for implying that you\u2019re a bad mom because you don\u2019t spend every second focused on your kid.", "NTA She was being rude and yeah, I also would not find it my place to get in the middle of their argument.", "It\u2019s the RVO part of DARVO. Reverse victim and offender. Too many people are happy to dish stuff out and then cry like they\u2019re the victim if anyone pushes back.", "And completely out of nowhere too, in response to OP turning down the zoo so she can get groceries and run errands. I\u2019d turn it around on her, \u201cI find it sad that you\u2019re so insecure in your own status as a \u2018good mom\u2019 that you have to attack my parenting the moment I don\u2019t want to do what you want.\u201d", "NTA thus is exactly how my toxic mom shames me and I haaaaaaate it. \"Don't you want what's best for her? I thought you loved her. It's just sad that she's missing out! I just want what's best!\" Makes me want to vomit thumbtacks.", "NTA\n\nYou handled it like you should.\n\nAnd by Jacks reaction, this isn't the first time Mae has overstepped, and been a bit of a \"Pinterest mom\"", "NTA but wow that must have been awkward jack and mae have issues they need to work on", "You're not the AH clearly she has issues with a lot of people concerning the same subject otherwise her husband would stay silent, OP thinks she's the saint of moms \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "NTA.\n\nYou got to run errands with kids in tow sometimes. It's a fact of life. I'm certain that my girls would 100% want nothing but a fun time making memories, but y'know, I also have to go shopping cos they require feeding and u actually think its beneficial for them too.\n\nAlso, there was nothing to defend. What was you supposed to say other than agree with her and go when you already had plans? She wasn't being a girls girl when she was attacking you in your own home. Given Jack's statements, this obviously runs a lot deeper than not going the zoo.", "NTA.\n\nMae has obviously pushed her parenting agenda onto other people and created problems for their family in the past, or else Jack wouldn't be so quick to jump on her when she starts in. This is a separate personal issue between them.\n\nYou have no obligation to defend her. The whole notion of \"girl code\" is bs. Why would you defend someone who's insulting you? \n\nYou wouldn't.", ">husband was super aggressive.\n\nhe wasn't tho was he", "tf? \ud83e\udd23\n\n>but he seems to like you. whats up with that?\n\nher friend seems to like her? hmm I wonder if that has something to do with being friends.."]}
