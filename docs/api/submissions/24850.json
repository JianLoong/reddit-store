We are both married and have 4 year old children. Jack and his wife Mae + kiddo are staying with us as we live in a popular holiday destination by the beach. \n\nI like Mae a lot, I always have, but she has very strict ideas about how she does things with regards to her child, which is fine, except she gets annoyed when people around her don\u2019t do the same. On more than one occasion I\u2019ve had to remind her that my child is not hers and neither am I and I will do as I see fit. \n\nTwo days ago at breakfast Mae suggested we take the kids to the zoo. I politely declined because firstly, I hate zoos, and second because I wanted to go into town, run some errands, and do some shopping, and I was planning to take kiddo with me. I told Mae this and said she was welcome to come with us or take one of our cars to the zoo, whichever she preferred. Mae said she was sure my daughter would much rather go to the zoo. I said that might be true, but the zoo isn\u2019t going anywhere and she will be fine spending the day with me. Mae then said it would be boring for a child to be dragged around doing grown up stuff all day and that as a mother why am I not willing to make sacrifices for my daughter? I was about to reply when Jack jumped in and said \u201cbecause maybe she still wants to be a human being and have something to talk about when her daughter goes to bed. Having a child and a personality isn\u2019t illegal\u201d. Mae snapped back that she was trying to be a good mother and give her child good  memories and Jack said that was fine but Mae shouldn\u2019t push that on me. Mae said she was just saying she finds it sad that I don\u2019t put my time into my daughter, so Jack said \u201cI\u2019m sure she finds all your Mary Poppins sh*t really f*cking boring but she\u2019s got manners and doesn\u2019t say anything so would you just give it a rest\u201d. I have never felt so awkward in my life. Mae kept looking at me like she thought I was going to say something but I was just there like, no I\u2019m not getting involved in this. Eventually my husband came out of his office and we all pretended the argument hadn\u2019t happened. \n\nI saw Mae later in the day and I could see she\u2019d been crying. She went off on me for not defending her when Jack was saying all those things, saying I wasn\u2019t a \u201cgirls girl\u201d and as a mother I should have stuck up for her. I wasn\u2019t going to argue with her since she\u2019d clearly had an awful day so I just said I was sorry she and Jack were going through a rough time and that it wasn\u2019t my intention to be the cause of any friction. \n\nShe\u2019s now giving me the cold shoulder, and making a point of making her own \u201cchild friendly\u201d plans since I prefer to have \u201cadult time\u201d. I don\u2019t think I was wrong for not jumping in because first, that was not my fight and two, Jack wasn\u2019t wrong.

Doesn't seem like Mae would have dropped it without someone being that direct though.", "NTA\n\nThere\u2019s obviously something deeper going on between Mae and Jack, definitely not your place to jump in. Also, Mae was insulting your parenting, so how does she expect you to stick up for her in that situation? \u201cNo jack, Mae is right. I am a selfish mother!\u201d \n\nSecondly, kids don\u2019t always have to be doing child-centered activities. Spending quality time with your child is important, even if every minute isn\u2019t a kid activity. My mom passed when I was 6, and some of my favorite memories with her are driving around with music blasting, running errands. Your child will remember spending time with you, not seeing some animals at the zoo. \n\nI do think it\u2019s worthwhile to have a conversation with Mae, and tell her how you feel by her comments about your parenting. You don\u2019t have to deal with that!", "NTA. That must've been awkward AF. Sounds like Mae is coming from a position of jealousy as well. Jack is a bit of the AH here, to have flipped out on his wife like that in front of you. And trust me, neither of your kids are going to remember this day when they're 21, so the \"making memories\" line is a bit of BS. Just because you're a mom doesn't mean you no longer exist.

She's respun the situation to put herself as the victim, and the icing on the toxic cake is the passive aggressive behaviour afterwards.  She's trying to punish you by making the holiday awkward until you give her a grovelling apology and agree to all her family orientated plans. Definitely NTA", "NTA. The fact that her husband jumped in so \"vigorously\" signals to me that there are bigger, longer-term issues happening between the two of them, probably related to the pushiness that she was demonstrating in her convo with you.", "NTA\n\nMae appears to have self confidence issues one way or the other.

Good for you! \nThen Jack seemingly continued some fight they\u2019ve been having privately. I wouldn\u2019t touch that with a ten foot pole. Good call again.\nAnd finally, she has the nerve to blame you for not sticking up for her? When she was being cruel to you? If you were to stick up for any woman and mother it should be you. You sound like a good mom. \nYour kid is 4, they can have fun at the zoo and the grocery store. Some of my favorite memories with my mom were doing normal mundane activities, but my mom made them fun.

When he saw her browbeating you, again, he called her out in the moment. What has she said or done to acknowledge your rights to make parenting choices that she disrespected with her attacks to violate the boundaries you set and make you change to her way? All I see is her blaming others for her discomfort when people react to her intrusive, devaling, persistent attacks on others' autonomy. Cloaking her intrusive controlling behavior in \"being a mom\" doesn't make it any more acceptable.", "Sounds as if Mae has made motherhood her entire personality, and Jack is tired of it all.

You have no control over what your children will and will not remember, and for most of us the most memorable occasions are ones of joy and connection, not mandatory fun at a theme park. \n\nMae needs to put down the 'being a mum is my whole identity' nonsense. I'm old now, and this seems to be a weird modern trend- you can't just be a parent to your children, you have to devote every waking moment to an Instagram-perfect version of childhood and family.

Sounds like Mae is quite pushy and judgmental of other parenting styles and that's caused some tension in her marriage.

Bet you she actually wanted time to get into your daughter's head. \n\nI do think you should excuse yourself next time though... this isn't the last fight they'll have.", "The only reason I could see OP being kind of an AH in this situation is because Mae and Jack are just visiting\u2026 so while she offered the car to the zoo, it would be nice to do activities with your guests instead of leaving them to do errands all day. Obviously errands must be done, but if the guests aren\u2019t there for long, going to touristy things like the zoo for one day during a visit from out of town guests is a nice thing to do\n\nObviously this changes depending on how long they are staying and if they are using OP for accommodations or if they came to visit OP and husband specifically.", "Mae has centered her entire personality and life towards catering to a 4yo and it\u2019s driving Jack up a wall is what it sounds like.

I mean, I don't have kids, so I'm likely talking out of my ass, but life isn't about being catered to and entertained at all times \u2013\u00a0eventually, you have to learn to entertain yourself. Parents have to run errands and they often have to bring their kids along for the ride, some of it will be fun and some of it will be boring as hell. Such is life.", "I have photos of my kids helping me shred documents when they were about 3.

OP you were NTA for not defending her when her husband was defending you against her. It\u2019s all well and good to want to give your children good experiences and memories, but you also need to take them on errands and things so they learn to manage boring stuff too. I have a feeling kindergarten is going to be hard for both Mae and her child.\n\nMy understanding is that the whole \u201cgirl\u2019s girl\u201d movement is supposed to be about not being petty and not dragging other girls for down for no reason or selfish reasons. It is not meant to say girls should defend other girls at all times even when they are wrong. But, much like anything meant to make the world a better place, people twist it for their own narrative and ruin it.", "You would hope he had, but I\u2019ve also seen people that refuse to talk about it and just make passive aggressive digs in front of other people. \n\nPlus I do think the personal insults from Jack were over the line, even if they had talked about it previously."]}
