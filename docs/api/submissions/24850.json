We are both married and have 4 year old children. Jack and his wife Mae + kiddo are staying with us as we live in a popular holiday destination by the beach. \n\nI like Mae a lot, I always have, but she has very strict ideas about how she does things with regards to her child, which is fine, except she gets annoyed when people around her don\u2019t do the same. On more than one occasion I\u2019ve had to remind her that my child is not hers and neither am I and I will do as I see fit. \n\nTwo days ago at breakfast Mae suggested we take the kids to the zoo. I politely declined because firstly, I hate zoos, and second because I wanted to go into town, run some errands, and do some shopping, and I was planning to take kiddo with me. I told Mae this and said she was welcome to come with us or take one of our cars to the zoo, whichever she preferred. Mae said she was sure my daughter would much rather go to the zoo. I said that might be true, but the zoo isn\u2019t going anywhere and she will be fine spending the day with me. Mae then said it would be boring for a child to be dragged around doing grown up stuff all day and that as a mother why am I not willing to make sacrifices for my daughter? I was about to reply when Jack jumped in and said \u201cbecause maybe she still wants to be a human being and have something to talk about when her daughter goes to bed. Having a child and a personality isn\u2019t illegal\u201d. Mae snapped back that she was trying to be a good mother and give her child good  memories and Jack said that was fine but Mae shouldn\u2019t push that on me. Mae said she was just saying she finds it sad that I don\u2019t put my time into my daughter, so Jack said \u201cI\u2019m sure she finds all your Mary Poppins sh*t really f*cking boring but she\u2019s got manners and doesn\u2019t say anything so would you just give it a rest\u201d. I have never felt so awkward in my life. Mae kept looking at me like she thought I was going to say something but I was just there like, no I\u2019m not getting involved in this. Eventually my husband came out of his office and we all pretended the argument hadn\u2019t happened. \n\nI saw Mae later in the day and I could see she\u2019d been crying. She went off on me for not defending her when Jack was saying all those things, saying I wasn\u2019t a \u201cgirls girl\u201d and as a mother I should have stuck up for her. I wasn\u2019t going to argue with her since she\u2019d clearly had an awful day so I just said I was sorry she and Jack were going through a rough time and that it wasn\u2019t my intention to be the cause of any friction. \n\nShe\u2019s now giving me the cold shoulder, and making a point of making her own \u201cchild friendly\u201d plans since I prefer to have \u201cadult time\u201d. I don\u2019t think I was wrong for not jumping in because first, that was not my fight and two, Jack wasn\u2019t wrong. Was I supposed to step in on someone else\u2019s marital argument?", "created_utc": 1692268985, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15tjs77/aita_for_not_defending_my_friends_wife_after_she/", "score": 99, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't fall for it.", "NTA. Mae is an idiot who can't comprehend how anyone can have an opinion different from hers. After she was told to stahp, she's resorting to emotional manipulation and pretends to be a victim.", "NTA.  Wasn't OP's place to get involved and Mae is absolutely delusional pulling a \"girl's girl\" card after nagging OP about her plans and taking shots at her parenting style.  OP's \"apology\" was well phrased and all that she needs to say on the matter lest they want to call out Mae on her BS.\n\nI don't know that what Jack said is completely defensible, but he's not wrong and I'd imagine that was a long time brewing.  Doesn't seem like Mae would have dropped it without someone being that direct though.", "NTA\n\nThere\u2019s obviously something deeper going on between Mae and Jack, definitely not your place to jump in. Also, Mae was insulting your parenting, so how does she expect you to stick up for her in that situation? \u201cNo jack, Mae is right. I am a selfish mother!\u201d \n\nSecondly, kids don\u2019t always have to be doing child-centered activities. Spending quality time with your child is important, even if every minute isn\u2019t a kid activity. My mom passed when I was 6, and some of my favorite memories with her are driving around with music blasting, running errands. Your child will remember spending time with you, not seeing some animals at the zoo. \n\nI do think it\u2019s worthwhile to have a conversation with Mae, and tell her how you feel by her comments about your parenting. You don\u2019t have to deal with that!", "NTA. That must've been awkward AF. Sounds like Mae is coming from a position of jealousy as well. Jack is a bit of the AH here, to have flipped out on his wife like that in front of you. And trust me, neither of your kids are going to remember this day when they're 21, so the \"making memories\" line is a bit of BS. Just because you're a mom doesn't mean you no longer exist. I have two kids that are 9 & 10 and thriving, but I didn't do much with them when they were younger. Sorry such a long explanation, but you shouldn't feel bad about this OP. NTA", "NTA - it\u2019s not your place to get in between their relationship.  \nPlus like you said you agreed with Jack.   \nI\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t have liked your opinion if you gave your real opinion.  \nThis girls girl things pisses me off.  \nJust because you don\u2019t agree with another woman then you are a traitor to your gender ?", "NTA she\u2019s annoying and her husband is fed up. If she had any self awareness, maybe she would be a person you could counsel but she doesn\u2019t. She wanted you to defend her against the person who was DEFENDING YOU from HER!!!! She can\u2019t even smell her stinky shits directly from the bowl.

Yo don\u2019t have to be anything.", "NTA. You said no, and she was trying to pressure you into what she thought was best.", "She doesn't get to decide how you spend the day with your child and her opinion about it is irrelevant.  Her husband called her out (in an AH way) when she wouldn't accept that and became manipulative.  She's respun the situation to put herself as the victim, and the icing on the toxic cake is the passive aggressive behaviour afterwards.  She's trying to punish you by making the holiday awkward until you give her a grovelling apology and agree to all her family orientated plans. Definitely NTA", "NTA. The fact that her husband jumped in so \"vigorously\" signals to me that there are bigger, longer-term issues happening between the two of them, probably related to the pushiness that she was demonstrating in her convo with you.", "NTA\n\nMae appears to have self confidence issues one way or the other. Either she thinks so little of herself that she has to put you down to feel better, or she thinks so highly of herself that she\u2019s just a snot who doesn\u2019t care who she steps on as she shares her \u201cpearls of wisdom.\u201d She tried to pick a fight with you and you didn\u2019t raise to the bait. Good for you! \nThen Jack seemingly continued some fight they\u2019ve been having privately. I wouldn\u2019t touch that with a ten foot pole. Good call again.\nAnd finally, she has the nerve to blame you for not sticking up for her? When she was being cruel to you? If you were to stick up for any woman and mother it should be you. You sound like a good mom. \nYour kid is 4, they can have fun at the zoo and the grocery store. Some of my favorite memories with my mom were doing normal mundane activities, but my mom made them fun. I\u2019d sit in the cart and stack the groceries around me like a fort. \n\nRaise your child and have fun with them however works for your family. Teach your daughter to treat people with love. Real girl\u2019s girls don\u2019t let their daughters grow up to be Maes.", "NTA Mae is completely out of line.  Kids dont always need \"child friendly\" activities/  You should take them out when you run boring adult errands.  I have always taken mine with me and they love helping at the shops or riding in the trolley, They are getting older now and love helping me order things.  Kids need to learn by watching,", "NTA and that's actually a good story, LoL. It's Mae's way or the highway! Don't let her control you or effect you.\n\nIf you had said something!?! Well, look up the dramatic triad. It would have escalated", ">Was I supposed to step in on someone else\u2019s marital argument?\n\nNTA and not at all, especially because you weren't on her side. You correctly stepped away from the conversation rather than make it a 2-on-1 argument.\n\nAnd I think Mae is perfectly capable of handling her own disagreements.", "NTA. She thinks women should support women? Where was her support when she was cutting you down?", "ESH. Everyone is being rude and disrespectful.\n\n>She went off on me for not defending her when Jack was saying all those things, saying I wasn\u2019t a \u201cgirls girl\u201d and as a mother I should have stuck up for her\n\nMae sucks because of this.\n\n>Mae then said it would be boring for a child to be dragged around doing grown up stuff all day and that as a mother why am I not willing to make sacrifices for my daughter? \n\nand that too.\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m sure she finds all your Mary Poppins sht really fcking boring but she\u2019s got manners and doesn\u2019t say anything so would you just give it a rest\u201d.\n\nok, Jack sucks too\n\n>I politely declined because firstly, I hate zoos\n\nand you are being rude and stubborn.

When he saw her browbeating you, again, he called her out in the moment. What has she said or done to acknowledge your rights to make parenting choices that she disrespected with her attacks to violate the boundaries you set and make you change to her way?
