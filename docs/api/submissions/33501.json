He was with this girl, Lucy, since he was 14 but she sadly passed away 2 years before we met. He did tell me about her after we got together but I never felt bothered or anything. \n\nWhen he introduced me to his family, most people were nice but his older sister Mia was a little mean. I brushed it off. But she soon started to compare me and Lucy to my face. She can say what she wants in private, but does she really have to tell me about how Lucy made him smile more, how Lucy was prettier, how Lucy was perfect, how their \u201clove story\u201d was more genuine and romantic compared to ours. It\u2019s making me a little crazy because even now, years later, she hasn\u2019t stopped. It\u2019s less aggressive now though after my husband yelled at her to stop talking about Lucy all the time. \n\nAnyways, I\u2019m pregnant. It was planned. We\u2019re having a boy. When we announced it to the rest of the family his sister walked out immediately but I paid her no mind and thankfully she hasn\u2019t said anything to my face. But my MIL invited me out to brunch with her and my sister in laws and we were talking about my baby and what I\u2019d name him. I showed them a list of names I liked and Mia immediately went \u201coh hell no you\u2019re not naming him \u201cEric\u201d.\u201d I said why. I should\u2019ve seen it coming but she basically said that Lucy wanted to name her future son Eric. Even my MIL was annoyed with her. I told Lucy that it\u2019s #8 on my top 10 list so she has nothing to worry about but I doubt Lucy would care even if I did name him Eric. \n\nI didn\u2019t mean it like \u201chaha well she\u2019s dead so what\u2019s she gonna do about it\u201d but like I can definitely hear how bad that sounded. Mia immediately went \u201chow fucking dare you, I knew you\u2019d show your true colors soon enough does my brother know about this?\u201d I told her she can go and tell him, we\u2019ll still be married. My MIL discreetly told me to stop but I was so pissed off. Mia eventually left. \n\nI was glad but my MIL and other SILs looked upset. They said they understand why I\u2019m so bothered but I can\u2019t blame Mia and she\u2019s been trying with me. They said what I said about Lucy was very rude too (even though I clearly didn\u2019t mean it like that) and that she would never say such a thing about me. My MIL is over it (probably because grandkids) but all her daughters hate me now.

I understand everyone felt Lucy\u2019s loss and everyone grieves in their own time, but to weaponize her grief to where she doesn\u2019t think her brother should be able to move on with another good woman is ridiculous. Her comments are beyond the pale. I\u2019m glad your husband is standing up for you, however, at this stage unless your sister makes some serious changes I would be reconsidering letting her anywhere around you while you\u2019re in a vulnerable state. \n\nI would suggest a private meeting with your MIL + FIL where you and your husband say in no uncertain terms that you are tired of Mia. That you are tired of continuing to try and any energy you have left needs to go to the baby. That if Mia continues you will be limiting contact with her and that includes family events she\u2019ll be in attendance because you both have reached your limit. Mia has had a lot of chances to get her shit together. If she\u2019s still hurting she needs professional help, but she is NOT trying like your MIL said. She\u2019s just changed tactics. You have done nothing to warrant this behavior and you genuinely fear that it\u2019ll carry over to your child. That fear is not irrational, because who carries a years long grudge against someone whose only crime is marrying their brother? Tell them they either wrangle her in or your child will have limited contact with your husbands side of the family because failure to act means they\u2019re enabling her behavior.\n\nLeave it up to your ILs to take care of this. Talk to your husband and tell him everything above first and that you can\u2019t afford to be nice anymore. You\u2019ll need a united front. Mia is not nice. Mia is not stable. She is a bully and mean and needs fucking help. \n\nCongrats on your tiny hooman!!! I\u2019m wishing you a healthy baby and a safe delivery \ud83e\udd70", "NTA but foolish. She set you up and you fell for it. Dumb move.", "NTA - come on. She's been antagonizing you this whole time, and nobody's said peep to her, but you say one thing marginally controversial (and even that is a stretch of a description) and they fall apart against you?", "NTA and given the circumstances even if you had said  \u201chaha well she\u2019s dead so what\u2019s she gonna do about it\u201d you wouldn't be the AH.\n\nAlso, many years ago may college roommate's wife got pregnant and I asked what they were planning to name the child and he said 'We're not announcing that until the child is born.'  I kind of rolled my eyes and thought, \"whatever, weirdo, it's not like I'm asking for the KFC secret original recipe here.\" \n\nI've since come to realize from reading this sub though that no good ever comes from telling anyone what names you are considering for a child. Just tell people after the child is born, when they are less likely to then offer their opinion of the name.\n\nAlso, I'm curious about one thing. Does your husband also remember that this deceased girl wanted to name her son Eric? That's a pretty common name, I'd question whether the sister really remembers  that or is just making it up to try to c*ckblock you from using the name you prefer.", "NTA - you obviously didn\u2019t come up with the list by yourself. Your husband seen the name and did not say anything. Only SIL!!!", "NTA. Sil has been bullying you for years and nobody has said a thing to her about it.  But you make one remark that she takes wrong, and you're the bad guy? \nSounds like you both need to go LC and NC with his family depending on each individual. This is a conversation with your husband.  You are the family he chose and he needs to choose you and your baby now and stand up for you. \nDo you have boundaries set up for your baby? It doesn't sound like you have enough for you.  I don't understand why you allow her access to you. I would go completely NC with her were I you. Stop trying to placate his family. You will never get this woman in your side,  and will therefore be at odds with all of them because of FaMiLy. Sounds like a classic narcissist leader with her enablers to me,  but I'm not there.  \n \nEdited to remove assumptions.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She is stuck on her for a reason and certainly haven\u2019t found a way to deal with it. Or she despises you and when she sees that being compared to Lucy effects you, she keeps on pushing in order to manipulate you to show aggression.\n\nEither way, NTA. You need to be smart here, try to see these traps of hers and avoid them. You might as well put some distance with Mia, she is clearly toxic. She needs to learn that there are consequences for her actions.", "Mia sounds like a total cow. NTA Yes, definitely talk to your husband about this because you will need his help protecting you from his bully of a sister. She needs to get a life.", "NTA.\n\nBut, you can be right and still be left standing in ruins.  Have you figured out you are in social warfare with this sister yet?  Have you figured out that how you respond to her colors other peoples perception of you yet?\n\nWrite off the sister, but you need to start handling her with finesse for 3rd party observers benefit.", "Yeah that was on me. I\u2019m still beating myself up for asking why when OBVIOUSLY she was going to somehow make it about Lucy. She only ever shows emotion around me if it\u2019s about her.", "Might just do that honestly. I felt the same as you until this very situation. \n\nAnd my husband probably does? I don\u2019t know he didn\u2019t bat an eye at my list or anything and he\u2019s been just as involved with choosing our baby\u2019s name. He has other names he prefers though he just hasn\u2019t mentioned the name \u201cEric\u201d specifically.", "NTA but go low contact with your husband whole family until they learn to respect you and your feelings. That includes your baby. No unsupervised visits with the baby as they cannot be trusted to stop her bad behavior \n\nYour SIL Is a huge aH and they are protecting her instead of telling her to get a freaking grip.\n\nThink whats gonna happen if such unhinged person is around your child? She could hurt your baby with her lies/bullying.\n\nIt's time to take a hard stance and tell your husband he either stands with you and your  baby in this or is in hot water with you.", "NTA - but does your husband realize what is being said to you?? He needs to step in and fix it", "Honestly at some point you're just going to have to cut her off. Imagine her saying this shit in front of your kids. Idk how long its been but I'm pretty sure nobody wants to be used like this after death.", "Exactly. Your husband needs to be on board with this too but she's a toxic nightmare who will try to turn your kids against you too.  So weird that she's this hung up on her brother's high school girlfriend. Sad that Lucy died but good lord, they probably would have broke up anyway. It was teenage romance, after all."]}
