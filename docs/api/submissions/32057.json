Her drinking has gotten to the point where I don't trust her to go alone anymore because she drives herself home. Last night our son called her to ask if he could get doordash for him and his friends. She didn't look at who was calling her and answered with \"Who the f\\*\\*\\* is this?\" after she found out it was our son I thought she would apologize but instead she cursed him out further after he asked for doordash. I had to take the phone from her to talk to him because it was so bad. After that I took her home and I talked to her today about her problem. I told her she needs to majorly cut back on alcohol because of her behavior when drunk. She said all she was doing was having fun with her friends. I told her she cursed out our son last night and she didn't see a problem with it.  After back and forth arguing for a while I told her I wasn't going to go with her anymore and she would have to uber there and back. She called me a controlling asshole for not letting her go out with her friends.

Nothing about her actions is okay, especially the fact that she sees nothing wrong with how she treated him.\n\nI get that you love your wife (I hope you do...) but you need to love your son more.  Maybe that means a treatment program for her or something, but your son will cut her off if she doesn't stop what she's doing.", "One definition of alcoholism is you are an alcoholic when alcohol consumption negatively affects your personal/family relationships and you don't recognize it. There are many definitions, I don't say this is ***the*** definition, but when you don't recognize your teenager being a responsible person and calling you to ask permission as they should to access a food service, and then further compound that by getting more abusive when it's made clear who she's talking to and why, that's a pretty negative affect. I can't diagnose her for you, that is up to you, all I'm saying id you should assess the situation critically.\n\nAnd as the spouse of an alcoholic, if you give in to her demand that you continue to facilitate her alcohol consumption, that looks very much like a codependent behavior to me, one you should resist at *all* costs.\n\nIn my life, one of my parents was an alcoholic who eventually recognized the problem and sought treatment and joined Alcoholics Anonymous, or AA. For the spouse and children there associated resources. For the spouse it's ALANON, for the children there's ALATEEN, and for me, being an adult when my parent sought help, there is ADULT CHILDREN OF ALCOHOLICS, also known as ACOA. These groups are not for everyone, and there are some others, but these are the ones I'm familiar with because the support we received from them was invaluable. The alcoholic does not need to be in AA for the other family members to seek help from the appropriate group. And not all groups are the same. There were a few helpful ACOA groups I met with, and there were some not so much, and a couple were toxic. If you seek these out, be aware that if one ALANON or ALATEEN or ACOA group you find is not helpful, there are others.\n\nI am a friend of Bill's children. IYKYK.

He may be a teen, but he's still a kid.\n\nQuit removing natural consequences of her behavior. And protect your son. IF you don't, you would 100% be the AH.
