These groups are not for everyone, and there are some others, but these are the ones I'm familiar with because the support we received from them was invaluable. The alcoholic does not need to be in AA for the other family members to seek help from the appropriate group. And not all groups are the same. There were a few helpful ACOA groups I met with, and there were some not so much, and a couple were toxic.

You do not recover your relationship with alcohol, you either are in recovery and no longer drinking, or you have changed your relationship with alcohol in a way that it no longer harms you or you no longer meet the definition of an alcoholic. \n\n\nBut quite frankly the people I know who had a problem with alcohol, then tried to control it rather than stop spiraled pretty fucking hard, because one of the things with addiction is that even if you are moderating your addiction, it's still taking up a big part of your brainpower to keep away form that addiction. It's like being told \"don't picture a pink elephant\" then trying not to. Does that work for anyone?", "If you can\u2019t bring yourself to stop drinking entirely, you\u2019re an alcoholic. Do you consider a drug addict who still uses their drug of choice no longer an addict because they cut back? I don\u2019t. If your addicted to something and you choose to partake in that addictive substance, you are still an addict, because you\u2019re obviously not over the addiction. Addiction doesn\u2019t stop entirely, you\u2019re either in recovery or in active addiction, and being in recovery means staying away from the addictive substance once you\u2019ve kicked it entirely. If you\u2019re trying to avoid it and have a slip up (someone giving you something that contains the substance without you realizing it, a slip up that the individual feels bad about, needing it medically to not be harmed by the withdrawn process, etc.) you\u2019re in recovery. If you actively choose to take the substance while knowing you\u2019re addicted to it, you\u2019re in active addiction. You can\u2019t partake in your addiction and be recovered at the same time.", "I would say yes.\n\nI regularly have patients who are seeing me because alcohol abuse has caused their hearts to be in very poor condition.\n\nEvery single one of them tells me they'll \"cut back\".\n\nSome of them even manage it...\n\n... For a while.\n\nAnd then they start increasing again.\n\nAnd then they'll come back and tell me that their symptoms are worse, and I'll look at their blood tests and tell them we've talked about drinking, and they'll say yeah and they cut back, and I'll say and then you cut forward again, and they'll either be shocked because they hadn't even noticed, ashamed because they did, or angrily demand to know if I'm calling them a liar.\n\nAnd then I deadpan and say no, their blood tests are, but there are other conditions that can cause the body to ferment alcohol internally and if they like I can send them for a range of very invasive tests, but if they want me to write those referrals I want it in writing from them that if the tests come back clear they'll book into a residential rehab facility.\n\nNever yet had that fail to get them to admit to the drinking.\n\nI'm going to add this: if the thought of living life entirely without alcohol is troubling to you you may already be an alcoholic.", "Yes, also they are always recovering, never recovered.", "He goes with her so she can drink. She got to the point where he started babysitting her so she could get shitfaced on a regular basis.

There\u2019s a difference between her not driving, and her being prevented from driving. One is a choice she makes, the other is someone else making the choice for her.", "My dad actually managed to go from being an alcoholic to sober for a very short period to an occasional drinker. Though I will say that as far as alcoholism was concerned, he was on the higher functioning end of the spectrum. He started drinking to help with insomnia because sleeping pills didn't work, and a habit became a problem. The thing that made him give up drinking was a medical issue. I can't remember the exact name of what he had. It wasn't caused by alcohol alone, but it was made much worse by drinking, and he was told it would likely happen again if he continued drinking heavily. The pain was bad enough that he said he'd rather give up drinking than have to go through it again. It's been about 10 years since then and while I have seen him drink, I haven't seen him drunk.", "Yeah Im watching some friends of mine splitting up after 50 yrs of marriage because the wife is a relentless alcoholic. Sad she is going to spend what\u2019s left of her life alone and drunk.", "Nah, just curious because you painted a pretty stark picture.", "I can only speak for myself. I used to drink whiskey every day after work. I didn\u2019t get hammered, but I drank every single day. At least a whole rocks glass of whiskey on the rocks. If there was no whiskey in the house I would drink whatever else there was. \n\nI decided I didn\u2019t like living this way and stopped drinking, except for social occasions with other people outside of the house. Now I drink like 1-2 times a month, if that. \n\nSo I went from definite alcoholic levels of drinking, if not full on alcoholic behavior, to drinking only occasionally. This has been stable for 2 years and I have no interest in relapsing to daily drinking.", "I find it effortless not to picture a pink elephant.\n\nI have aphantasia. I can't picture anything.\n\nI agree that alcoholics need to stop. I have patients who struggle with cutting down even after I tell them that continuing to drink heavily will kill them within a year.\n\nI had one who was trying to bribe nurses to bring him alcohol while he was in critical care.", "But the way you're talking about it makes it sound like you think consuming any amount of substance is indicative of addiction. So if you tell me \"YOU AREN'T ALLOWED TO HAVE A BEER FOR THE NEXT MONTH\", I'm probably gonna say \"I'll do what I want\", and your response is \"Well then you're an addict!\"\n\nI may be misunderstanding/misinterpreting, so I apologize in advance if that's the case.\n\nIn any case, isn't the ability to enjoy substances in moderation specifically the behavior of a person that is \\*not\\* addicted to those substances?", "None of that first part really surprises me, sadly.\n\n>I'm going to add this: if the thought of living life entirely without alcohol is troubling to you you may already be an alcoholic.\n\nThis is just silly. Of course the thought of living life entirely without alcohol \"troubles me\". I like to have a drink now and again. Hazy IPA's are like the nectar of life.\n\nThere are probably 1000 other things I can think of that fall into precisely the same category, albeit for different reasons. Living without my computer would trouble me. Living without my car would trouble me, and that's arguably just as dangerous as alcohol can be. There are countless food products, both healthy and unhealthy, that I don't want to live without.\n\nYour statement is pretty similar circular logic to \"Not being able to admit that you're an alcoholic is the first sign that you're an alcoholic\".", "We know that her drinking is causing problems at home (OP said as much in the post) and that she is accusing him of being \"controlling\" because he won't enable her drinking anymore and let's not forget how she was treating their underage son simply for asking for dinner. As a recovering alcoholic I promise you she is an alcoholic herself every action OP has stated simply screams it. If she wasn't an alcoholic she would be willing to have a conversation about her drinking and not get defensive or try gaslighting.", "That VERY specific definition is actually very broad, and includes a lot of behaviors that some people consider normal. \n\nHere are the symptoms of Alcohol Use Disorder from the Mayo Clinic.

Signs and symptoms may include:\n\n    Being unable to limit the amount of alcohol you drink\n    Wanting to cut down on how much you drink or making unsuccessful attempts to do so\n    Spending a lot of time drinking, getting alcohol or recovering from alcohol use\n    Feeling a strong craving or urge to drink alcohol\n    Failing to fulfill major obligations at work, school or home due to repeated alcohol use\n    Continuing to drink alcohol even though you know it's causing physical, social, work or relationship problems\n    Giving up or reducing social and work activities and hobbies to use alcohol\n    Using alcohol in situations where it's not safe, such as when driving or swimming\n    Developing a tolerance to alcohol so you need more to feel its effect or you have a reduced effect from the same amount\n    Experiencing withdrawal symptoms \u2014 such as nausea, sweating and shaking \u2014 when you don't drink, or drinking to avoid these symptoms\n\nShe's experiencing several of them, and if she's drunk like that she probably is also binge drinking, another type of alcohol use disorder. \n\nShe's not okay.

Thanks for sharing. I also tried to drink myself to sleep for years due to insomnia and finally my stomach ulcers couldn't take anymore. Got so bad if I tried to take a shot of liquor I would just immediately puke. Terrible time. Then I started smoking weed daily instead of just every once in a while and that made me feel better but I'd still have problems with insomnia several nights every week.

As soon as an ex-alcoholic drinks alcohol again, those coping mechanisms stop working and you need the drug again.", "The way I see it is that if you have proven yourself to be addicted to a substance, to be considered recovered you need to entirely remove said substance from your life. Challenging someone to a dry January thing and them drinking regardless bc they don\u2019t want to participate in the challenge isn\u2019t addiction. Someone needing to babysit you so that you don\u2019t drive drunk on a regular basis and calling them controlling for telling you to take an Uber because you\u2019re an awful person while drunk, yet continuing to drink alcohol, THAT makes you an alcoholic. \n\nThere\u2019s a healthy way to drink (Not binge drinking, not being an absolute monster to those around you, not being a drunk driver, etc), and there\u2019s an unhealthy, addictive way to drink. If you\u2019re addicted to a substance, either don\u2019t use it, or don\u2019t get mad when you get called an addict or when people don\u2019t want to be around you because they don\u2019t want to be exposed to your addiction.", "Plus she was driving drunk until OP started driving her.", "Yeah, every time I see someone trying to narrow down the alcoholic definition, I assume they also have a drinking problem they're trying to keep in control.

Options one and two put the burden on her to fix it. Option 3 is OP enabling it. If you go with someone so they can partake in their addiction, you\u2019re enabling the addiction.", "I see what you\u2019re trying to say, and \u201cenabling\u201d may be a bit harsh as it can be perceived as pejorative. It\u2019s clear OP does not want his wife drinking this way. Certainly him not letting her drive intoxicated is a good thing.
