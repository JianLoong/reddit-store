I'd recommend doing that too. She's also not allowed to have Facebook.", "YTA only if you keep allowing her to have access to tiktok. She's not mature enough to have such unfettered access like that. You checking on her account at times isn't enough, she shouldn't be allowed on the app at all imo (or can, but only to view videos, no comments or posting of herself. I don't think that's an account option though. Even her reading the wrong comment section with inappropriate context could be harmful to her, even if she's banned from interacting with those comments. \n\nThe only way to prevent it all is by getting rid of the app, of only go on it supervised with someone right there. If she's too young for you to have in depth talks about the dangers of the Internet, grooming etc, then she's too young to have access to something like tiktok. \n\nThe usual 'stranger danger' basic talk doesn't work for today's Internet, the way it did for teaching kids into to get in strangers cars. Explain to your kiddo why you're taking away tiktok in an age appropriate way. Tell her that your rules are there to protect her and as she grows up, she'll gain more freedom and autonomy over things like that. But for now, you need to be the filter for her.

These creeps won't stop being creeps no matter what you wear, even if you are wearing a oversized tshirt and sweats or you are wearing a crop top they won't stop.", "YTA for both making a clothing item more sexualized than it needs to be, and for letting your young kid post videos of herself on tiktok. This isn't really about what she can wear \"in public\" it's about what she can wear when performing on social media.

I think you can help her find some middle ground though. Maybe crop tops that aren\u2019t tight and don\u2019t show stomach? And maybe that is must be worn with high waisted pants so it doesn\u2019t show anything\n\nI 100% understand her want for shorter tops since long tops just tend to not be flattering on me, so I end up tucking them in or cutting them. Although I guess I\u2019m 25 and an 11 year old doesn\u2019t really need something that\u2019s \u201cflattering\u201d anyway lol\n\nI would think a crop top could be anything that crops at the waist line or above, so maybe work with her to find something that\u2019s appropriate that she still feels is fashionable. I know h&m sells basic plain colored tshirts that are very mildly cropped but loose and have never shown any stomach for me when I wore them with high waisted pants (I\u2019m 5\u20193\u201d so probably not that much taller than whatever her height is)\n\nDefinitely make sure her tiktok is private though!!!!!
