She's extremely picky, very sensitive about food, loses interest in eating, and usually isn't hungry at traditional times. I've struggled for years to get her to eat meals with me but to no avail. Trying too hard usually deters her worse so we've created a system where I stock up bulk on foods and snacks she's willing to eat. She goes to get what she wants when she's hungry throughout the day, and we've managed to get her to maintain her weight.\u00a0\n\n\nMy sister Jeannie (28F) asked to move into my apartment when her boyfriend left her and the kids a few months ago. She has three kids under six years old. Her kids are wild and always into everything. I don't mind them acting like kids, but I worry about them getting hurt. I told my sister she needed to do a better job of keeping her kids safe. She took that and ran with it by getting child safety locks on just about everything. I didn't mind because I feel more secure knowing they can't stick keys in sockets or get into the bleach. However, she recently added a lock to our fridge because her middle son (3) has a food allergy.\u00a0\n\n\nHe figured out how to open the fridge and came very close to eating something he was allergic to before his sister (6) noticed. I agreed to try out the lock because it was easy enough to get open for me. It wasn't so easy for my daughter. In fact, she can't get it open at all. When I notice her by the fridge, I try to get it open quickly so she can get what she wants, but usually by the time I see her there, she's lost interest. Because of this, she hasn't been eating nearly as much. I told my sister she had to get rid of the lock because it was affecting my kid. It turned into a fight because she accused me of trying to hurt her son by having foods he's allergic to in the fridge and how the lock is for his safety. I offered to move the offending food up higher but apparently he can climb.\u00a0\n\n\nOur fight spiraled and I told her that she had to remove it and to watch her kids better so the lock wasn't needed. She refused again and said she'd do what she had to for her kid. So when she left, I removed the lock and threw it away. When she got back and noticed, we got into another fight. We've been feuding over it for the last three days and she said today she's going to get a new one. I asked my mom about it, but she's taking her side since my nephew can get sick off the food if he gets it while my daughter is still eating even if it's not as much.

What about if you had one cabinet that has a lock in it with the food he is allergic to? That\u2019s the best compromise here. Maybe some visual aids on the fridge to remind the boys to not dig in the fridge too. Other than that, you cannot put your child at risk for hers.

His little brother also suffers from severe food allergies so it\u2019s a struggle for their parents for sure. You have two equally important but competing needs here that both need to be addressed. Food allergies can be a life or death situation and at 3 your nephew isn\u2019t old enough to know how to stay out of the fridge. \n\nHowever, your daughter needs to be able to eat when she can. This is a situation where some thinking outside the box is in order so everyone gets their needs met. Is there another option here y\u2019all can come to a conclusion of? Can you get your daughter a table top fridge that\u2019s out of your nephew\u2019s reach that contains her approved foods? Is your daughter capable of learning how to use a different type of fridge lock? Can you get a fridge alarm that lets out a noise whenever the fridge is opened. It may be annoying but it would help alert one of y\u2019all to the fact that the fridge is being opened. You know as a mom that it\u2019s damn near impossible for a parent to be eyes on a kid 24/7. Kids are sneaky little creatures and fast as hell too.\n\nI know it\u2019s super frustrating but I definitely think practicing a little grace over judgment here is in order. Both kids have equally important issues that requires them safe access to food and even though your sister is a guest in your home for now it doesn\u2019t sound like this was a situation she voluntarily found herself in.

If she wants to make rules she can get her own place.\n\nThat said, I have cats who like to open the freezer and leave it open....how they manage I have no clue but it has meant that we had to get a child lock for the freezer. We got one that is attached with an adhesive and for lack of better terms had a magnetic key that you can just stick on the lock mechanism and then open....hardest part is remembering to lock it back up again. Maybe get something higher on the fridge door with a key that can be stored high to make it easier for your daughter? She likely will forget to close it but at least if your intervention is needed after instead of before then she won't miss out on eating. Granted that may be problematic too, idk.

She is a guest so she has no right to make changes without consulting you but you should also be a bit more accommodating.  \nThere are so many ways to find a solution:\n\n\\- keep kitchen closed/put a kid fence in kitchen doorway\n\n\\- get a lock that can be opened easily  (like e.g. just glue something on the fridge that is easy to open and out of reach for a 3y-old but not a 9y-old\n\n\\- don't keep allergy food in fridge or in an extra box with a childlock", "ESH\n\nThere are two kids with very valid needs.  There has to be a compromise.  Either way I think your sister should find her own accommodations quickly as she moved in with you.", "honestly tell your sister to find her own place.", "NTA.  Your sister has been staying at your apartment a couple months and now it is time for her and her kids to go find another place.  There is not enough room for you to both raise your kids how they need to be.  Her son CAN NOT have access to the fridge and your daughter MUST have access to the fridge.  You have to do what is best for your daughter and let your sister figure out her own thing.", "NTA. How about your mom takes on your sister and the kids?", "INFO\nWhy do you insist on keeping the allergen in your home if it's life threatening to your nephew?  Throwing it out is much cheaper than a mini fridge and would eliminate the need for the lock.", "INFO: Is it possible to put the offending food in its own lockbox rather than putting a lock on the fridge? Could you just stop buying the offending food altogether? What is the allergy and how severe is it?", "Why not just not buy the food the kid is allergic too and then you don't need the lock?", "NTA. This is your house and your daughter needs to be your top priority.", "NTA\n\nMy son has had multiple food allergies since birth (egg, wheat, tree nuts, bananas, tomatoes). We never had a lock on our fridge. By age 2 he was quite clear on what he could and couldn\u2019t eat and would ask about items he was unsure of. Your sister is the AH for not training her son better.", "Why is this even an argument? Your home, your rules. Throw out the whole lot of them. NtA.", "NTA\n\nBut there are solutions to this that don't involve a lock. Sister just need to... pull her head out of her rear and figure something out? Right off the bat I think, put things he is allergic to out of his reach, he's only 3. Depending on his allergy this may or may not work. Or putting all allergens in a smaller fridge with a lock on it? Is something he is allergic to in your daughter's favorite foods though? Ugh that would be an issue. \n\nAny I feel like this could be mediated with slight changes that would keep him safe and your daughters still able to eat her favorite foods without difficulty. But you are NOT the AH for standing up for your daughter in this situation.", "NTA he\u2019s three she should have a constant eye on him. If he can get into the fridge then she\u2019s failing. If this is her hill to die on she and go live with your mother who apparently has no issue with locks on the fridge.", "NTA\n\nYou need a dorm fridge either for your daughter\u2019s safe foods or one with a lock for the foods to which your nephew is allergic. They both have important needs that greatly affect their health. You\u2019re both concerned about your children. If you can separate the \u201cdangerous\u201d foods to your nephew from the safe foods for your daughter, you might find more peace.", "Your asshole sister is free to have rules for her own apartment once she's able to pay for one. Until then, she should stfu and follow host's rules.", "Sounds like your sister and her kids need to go live with mom.", "Nta, tell your sister to move", "NTA but have you considered storing the allergen in a drawer of the fridge with a child lock so your daughter can access the fridge but her kid still can't access the allergen?", "NTA- your mom is ok with your daughter starving? Tell her that she can take them in", "So your daughter is supposed to starve because she can\u2019t mind her own child in YOUR home?\n\nNope.

It sounds like your daughter has you wrapped around her finger and the three year old has a serious food allergy.  You told your sister to be more responsible, which she did take care of, and now your complaining???", "Absolutely the best response. Kick them out OP, it's your daughters home 1st. Your mom can either put them up or pay for their own place.", ">Perhaps an option might be to keep the food the boy is allergic to in a fridge lockbox?\n\nThis is the answer. Or don't have food he's so allergic to in the house at all.", "Especially since he has an allergy. She can\u2019t control the whole world for him, but 3 is old enough to know he shouldn\u2019t eat things without checking. \n\nSource: I work with three year olds at a part time job teaching music", "Stay strong for your girl, mama. Few people understand the stress of a chronically underweight child. My 10 year old was Failure To Thrive at 8, and just NOW got to 60lbs!!!! And I'm ridiculously proud of every teeny tiny ounce she gains! And VERY protective of her safe foods, and eating habits!!!\n\n\nThe majority of people will just not get it. When your underweight kid gets a cold they lose 3lbs. Which took them 10 MONTHS to gain. And now they will no longer eat one of their safe foods because it tasted \"off\" from the cold.\n\n\nAs long as too many of her safe foods aren't his unsafe foods, I'd get a fridge lockbox. But if that just won't work out, I'd have to tell sister to find another situation for herself and the kids.\n\n\nBeing underweight is far more dangerous to children than a lot of people understand. They aren't educated about it. But it can be very very bad, very quickly.\n\n\nGood luck to you and your girl! NTA!", "How is a mini fridge a punishment? So many kids would think that\u2019s a cool thing to have all on their own.", "I didn\u2019t mean the cousins safe foods I meant the daughters. Not so much in terms of what they can\u2019t eat but what she will if she\u2019s a reluctant eater. I see what you mean though", "Sister is guest and it's on her to parent her allergic child. If she can't she should find another accommodation.\nMy daughter has dairy allergy, when she was 2.5 she knew she can't have milk cause it makes her tummy ache. It's not difficult to teach a child they can't eat something cause it'll make them sick"]}
