She's extremely picky, very sensitive about food, loses interest in eating, and usually isn't hungry at traditional times. I've struggled for years to get her to eat meals with me but to no avail. Trying too hard usually deters her worse so we've created a system where I stock up bulk on foods and snacks she's willing to eat. She goes to get what she wants when she's hungry throughout the day, and we've managed to get her to maintain her weight.\u00a0\n\n\nMy sister Jeannie (28F) asked to move into my apartment when her boyfriend left her and the kids a few months ago. She has three kids under six years old. Her kids are wild and always into everything. I don't mind them acting like kids, but I worry about them getting hurt. I told my sister she needed to do a better job of keeping her kids safe. She took that and ran with it by getting child safety locks on just about everything. I didn't mind because I feel more secure knowing they can't stick keys in sockets or get into the bleach. However, she recently added a lock to our fridge because her middle son (3) has a food allergy.\u00a0\n\n\nHe figured out how to open the fridge and came very close to eating something he was allergic to before his sister (6) noticed. I agreed to try out the lock because it was easy enough to get open for me. It wasn't so easy for my daughter. In fact, she can't get it open at all. When I notice her by the fridge, I try to get it open quickly so she can get what she wants, but usually by the time I see her there, she's lost interest. Because of this, she hasn't been eating nearly as much. I told my sister she had to get rid of the lock because it was affecting my kid. It turned into a fight because she accused me of trying to hurt her son by having foods he's allergic to in the fridge and how the lock is for his safety. I offered to move the offending food up higher but apparently he can climb.\u00a0\n\n\nOur fight spiraled and I told her that she had to remove it and to watch her kids better so the lock wasn't needed. She refused again and said she'd do what she had to for her kid. So when she left, I removed the lock and threw it away. When she got back and noticed, we got into another fight. We've been feuding over it for the last three days and she said today she's going to get a new one. I asked my mom about it, but she's taking her side since my nephew can get sick off the food if he gets it while my daughter is still eating even if it's not as much.

What about if you had one cabinet that has a lock in it with the food he is allergic to? That\u2019s the best compromise here. Maybe some visual aids on the fridge to remind the boys to not dig in the fridge too. Other than that, you cannot put your child at risk for hers.

His little brother also suffers from severe food allergies so it\u2019s a struggle for their parents for sure. You have two equally important but competing needs here that both need to be addressed. Food allergies can be a life or death situation and at 3 your nephew isn\u2019t old enough to know how to stay out of the fridge. \n\nHowever, your daughter needs to be able to eat when she can. This is a situation where some thinking outside the box is in order so everyone gets their needs met. Is there another option here y\u2019all can come to a conclusion of? Can you get your daughter a table top fridge that\u2019s out of your nephew\u2019s reach that contains her approved foods? Is your daughter capable of learning how to use a different type of fridge lock? Can you get a fridge alarm that lets out a noise whenever the fridge is opened. It may be annoying but it would help alert one of y\u2019all to the fact that the fridge is being opened. You know as a mom that it\u2019s damn near impossible for a parent to be eyes on a kid 24/7. Kids are sneaky little creatures and fast as hell too.\n\nI know it\u2019s super frustrating but I definitely think practicing a little grace over judgment here is in order. Both kids have equally important issues that requires them safe access to food and even though your sister is a guest in your home for now it doesn\u2019t sound like this was a situation she voluntarily found herself in.

We got one that is attached with an adhesive and for lack of better terms had a magnetic key that you can just stick on the lock mechanism and then open....hardest part is remembering to lock it back up again. Maybe get something higher on the fridge door with a key that can be stored high to make it easier for your daughter? She likely will forget to close it but at least if your intervention is needed after instead of before then she won't miss out on eating. Granted that may be problematic too, idk.
