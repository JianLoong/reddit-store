We start to unload the car and ask where our room is, my mom responds: \"you guys get the bunk bed.\" me, thinking it was a joke I say \"ooh I get top bunk!\" Their response was \"no, actually you get the bunk bed.\" They were 100% serious. While my 2 other sisters get a room for themselves and their husbands, with queen size beds, me and my wife get the literal kids room with a bunk bed!\n\nMe and my wife don't want to cause a scene and still want to be grateful for my parents paying for our accommodations, so we agree to just give the bed a try for one night and see how it goes. Fast-forward to bedtime, around 12:00 we lay down on the bed for the first time, it's as if you're sleeping on a wooden board. It's extremely uncomfortable even for me, which means my wife was in a lot more pain due to her being pregnant. We toss and turn for a couple hours, and finally we both agree to just go sleep on the couch in the living room. It's around 2:00 AM now, the couch is by no means comfortable, but in comparison to the bed it was a lot better. \n\nWe get a couple hours sleep when my dad wakes up and sees us on the couch and decides to go back to the master bedroom to not disturb us. Again, we don't want to create a scene so we just go back upstairs and try to get a little more sleep on the bunk bed before everyone wakes up. We get around an hour of the worst sleep I've ever had, and just decide to just wake up and go downstairs knowing we couldn't do that for a second night.\n\nWe booked a room at a hotel for a couple more nights to just get past the wedding then we were going to leave for home. After explaining the situation to my whole family, instead of accepting it or helping us, most of them start getting annoyed, saying that this is just another way for us to distance ourselves from the family. We just sternly say that we already made our decision and they were just going to have to accept it. Now most of my family is irritated at us saying that we ruined their trip. AITA? \n\nTLDR: My family gave me and my pregnant wife a bunk bed to sleep on for 5 nights while everyone else got queen size beds.

You were given unrealistic accommodations and instead of complaining, you found reasonable ones.  If your family wanted you and your wife there that badly, they\u2019d have offered to trade beds with you.\n\nAlso, if your presence was the make or break for an enjoyable trip, they should have given you the best bedroom.", "NTA. \n\nI can't even...just no. Good for you for looking out for your very pregnant wife (and yourself). \n\nI'm old and not pregnant and if my parents did this I would do the same thing you did. Why would they even book this place knowing that your pregnant wife would have to sleep on a bunk bed?!? That's next level, OP, sorry.", "Don't think I've seen a more clear NTA.\n\nYou didn't put up a fuss, didn't act entitled to something, did your best to accommodate and it just didn't work. Honestly were a lot more gracious than I think I would have been. \n\nIf they wanted everyone to be together, they should have looked more closely to make sure the accommodations would be accommodating for everyone. Or they could have offered to switch with you. They had many options available  and they chose to be idiots.", "NTA.   You had every right and reason to get a different place to sleep comfortably. It seems like you were nice about it. I am not sure why the bob was booked knowing four adult couples were coming and only three adult rooms were there.   They had to know the accommodations and at the very least everyone should have been given a heads up if this was all they could get so you may have been prepared or made other arrangements from the jump.  To be fair straws should have been drawn for the bunk beds.", "NTA\n\nGood for you and your wife for putting your foot down and telling them what was happening instead of asking. The fact that they thought this was alright says a lot about how they view you & your wife. Family members can be very toxic, and you need to know when it's time to get some quiet time from those members. You guys didn't ruin their trip, they ruined yours.", "NTA\n\n>Now most of my family is irritated at us saying that we ruined their trip. AITA?\n\nWhy the eff would that ruin *their* trip?  Are they some sort of sadistic control freaks or something?  And what jerks would subject a heavily pregnant woman to that or resent her for improving the situation?\n\nYou made the right call, no doubt.\n\nHonestly, I'd tell 'em to go eff themselves and let the chips fall where they may.  A few months without meeting your little one could be a nice attitude adjustment for them.", "It makes zero sense to put a pregnant woman in uncomfortable kids beds while everyone else gets a better bed. \n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the bunk beds were uncomfortable.\n\nINFO: If someone really didn\u2019t see the problem, any of them could have volunteered to sleep in the bunk beds so you could have a queen bed. Did anyone offer that solution? Or did everyone just act like you were being difficult and should suck it up?", "NTA. Why on earth would they expect a 7.5-month pregnant woman to sleep on a bunkbed along with her husband. This whole set up sounds like a passive/aggressive power move. Punishing you for supposedly distancing yourselves from them.\n\nIf I were you, I would make their jibe a reality. Seriously, why would you want to spend time with people who would abuse you this way. And abuse is exactly what they did by making a pregnant woman sleep in a bunkbed. Then they gaslight you by trying to blame you for leaving...Uh yeeeah. Nope.\n\nETA: *when the BNB was booked we were shown a different place entirely. A place that had the correct amount of beds. They changed the reservation on us.* Bingo. I was right about this being a power move.", "Sounds like you should distance yourself from them. NTA", "NTA.\n\nBut the title of the party is misleading. It's less about having to sleep in a bunk bed and more about having to sleep in an uncomfortable bed. \n\nLots of Airbnbs and Vrbos tend to have a bunk room in large homes. It makes sense, as it is more inclusive of all types of travelers (kids, single folks, and couples can all sleep in a bunk room with little awkwardness), and means their listing will be more popular. You were a good sport and tried the bunk bed, so you're in the clear here.", "NTA.  I have to wonder if this is a regular cycle.  They set you up for some kind of obvious failure, then blame you when the obvious failure occurs.  But you shouldn't have said \"we've made our decision.\"  That suggests the decision was up for debate.  The right answer was a callout of the actual problem: \"You  can't seriously expect someone 7 1/2 months pregnant to sleep on a bunk bed.  We even tried it, and there's just no way.  It's great to see you and I wish we could have made the whole trip work, but this is just totally unreasonable.\"", "NTA. Bunk beds aren\u2019t for adults, especially pregnant adults. It\u2019s weird they thought that was acceptable and didn\u2019t bother to tell you. You tried it  and were gracious, it didn\u2019t work, you made other arrangements.", "NTA. Your family is in the wrong, and your sisters are selfish: one of the rooms with the queen bed should have gone to you and your pregnant wife. \n\nYou took care of it in the best way possible. If the others' trips are ruined, that's their choice. Clearly, they didn't think about your wife's comfort at all, even after you pointed it out to them.", "NTA. It really doesn\u2019t even matter the reason for moving to a hotel, who cares? Have your sisters been pregnant? I could barely sleep in my own bed at the end of my pregnancy.", "NTA.

I would have done everything exactly as you did.", "How in the hell did you ruin their trip? Is it because you aren't there to either make fun of or yell at. You not being there makes the place quieter so what's the problem? There is no  need for you to be there.\n\nNTA in any way!", "NTA  Does your family dislike your wife?  Cause seriously who would put the pregnant family member in the worst bed in the house? You have ever right to get that hotel room and get a decent night sleep.  You're on vacation for crying out loud, it should be enjoyable.", "NTA \n\nThat was real disrespectful move on your family\u2019s part", "NTA - pregnancy trumps.  \n\nAnd uncomfortable beds are not meant for adults. I would leave too", "Nta.  They know they were in the wrong.  You acted with maturity.", "Right, so a pregnant lady needs to be uncomfortable and even more sleep deprived to make this trip enjoyable for three other couples. If OP and wife's presence is that important, why didn't one of the other couples offer up their room? Why didn't the parents find a place to properly accommodate four adult couples?", "According to OP, the house his parents were shown is the not the house they ended up getting.

They didn\u2019t intend to book a house with bunk beds in one of the rooms.", "That's the frustrating part, when the BNB was booked we were shown a different place entirely. A place that had the correct amount of beds. They changed the reservation on us.", "So the day after we slept on the bed my mom offered her and my dads bed, but we didn't feel comfortable taking their bed since they spend a couple thousand dollars on the place for the 5 nights. My sister's never once offered their beds though.", "I do like the other responce you gave. I don't know how that would have gone over. I hope well. We probably let our emotions get the better of us in the response we gave. We were both emotionally exhausted at that point.", "That's what I'm not absolutely sure about. Because my sister's sent us the original BNB listing, (which we were happy with) then the place changed. I don't know if that was on Airbnb side, or they just found a cheaper place. I haven't spoken to my family since we left so I haven't been able to ask them.", "Well, in that case my answer doesn't really change. He still was well within bounds to get comfortable accommodations for him and his pregnant wife. His family is still out of bounds for giving him grief for doing so.", "The company changed  the place you reserved?  That's allowed?", "Well, I think it would have been fine to say, \u201cMom, you\u2019re the last one who should have to sleep in the bunk beds! I\u2019d never want you to do that.\u201d And then suggest one of your sisters could trade you instead.\n\nI think this would have been a better first solution, and the hotel could have been a last resort. I could understand them being miffed if you didn\u2019t try for a solution that would keep everyone in the same house. \n\nYou also could have said: \u201cWe\u2019d be happy to get ourselves a hotel, unless one of you (sisters) feels you\u2019d be comfortable with the bunk beds. But they\u2019re not comfortable, so I won\u2019t blame you if you\u2019d rather not.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t believe both sisters felt fine taking the better beds and leaving your wife in a bunk bed at 7.5 months.\n\nYour parents may have felt embarrassed about the change in rentals. Or guilty, if they felt they were letting you down. So they might have felt worse about the hotel solution than you did.", "NTA.  You were both being gracious by staying in that for one night.

My bet is your parents and sisters knew about this and decided to pull the whole \u201cwe got here first so we got to pick first\u201d rouse to be cheap and leave you hanging.", "NTA, and your family are not good people.

In what world does family put a pregnant woman on a bunkbed for five nights and not only think it's OK, but say their wedding vacay is ruined when she and her partner don't want to sleep in them? Terrible, awful people--that's WHO!\n\nNTA. They are, though.", "Is your family made up of morons.

They can see each other during the day and then OP and wife can actually sleep well, which you would think everyone would want for the 7 1/2 month pregnant woman.", "As someone who is currently 8 months pregnant, if I showed up at a Airbnb and they tried to put my husband and I in bunk beds I\u2019d immediately turn around and drive to the nearest hotel or back home depending on my mood Nta", "If you book someplace for the whole family, you book a place that actually  ACCOMODATES the whole family.

Whoever booked the air bnb fucked up and should have had the decency to take the bunks instead of forcing a pregnant woman to do so. Notice none of the whinging whiners offered to give up their beds? The absolute hide of these arseholes!!!! No wonder you distance yourselves from them. They sound self absorbed and downright ignorant.", "NTA Tell them they're absolutely right that you do want to distance yourself from them cause wow these are the exact type of people you want to distance yourself from", "NTA...good for you for taking care of your wife. Your sisters should keep their opinions to themselves unless they want to trade rooms.", "Oh yeah, exactly what you said. We should all know what side the favorite grandparents might be from for half a year or so\u2026 lol", "I agree with you there. That's why I specified that we got there 30 min after them. When we got to the BnB their bags were already in their respective rooms and we're almost done unpacking.", "This!  My fiance and I rented an Airbnb house with my sister and some cousins for a wedding.  On paper it had enough beds. But one room had 2 double beds.  As we got there last, we got last pick of rooms, with them2 double beds. \n\nSuper uncomfortable,  my loud cousins stayed up til 3 am, and we could not sleep together. \n\nWe left after a night and rented a cottage for the rest of the trip. \n\nNo one's fault but my own, but never again.", "It is probably a distorted version of a \"family sticks together\" mindset. In this case, a perception that if they're not all sharing the same accomodations, the \"family\" aspect of the trip is gone.\n\nNotice that OP also said family members accused them of going to a hotel being another way of \"distancing themselves\". Suggests they think OP and his wife don't spend enough time with them.\n\nThere's s good chance the mindset of those other family members covered other activities as well, and not just where they were staying. \"Everyone has to do everything together\"\n\nWhich I could see causing a \"ruined\" declaration even if the bed issue hadn't been there. OPs wife is 7.5 months pregnant. Depending on what they had planmdd during the days, it would be easy to imagine her wanting to sit something out. Or maybe stay back and take a nap.\n\nIf these people can't get the idea \"we shouldn't put pregnant lady in a bunk bed\", it's easy to imagine one of them pitching a fit because she wants a nap.", "people, especially pregnant people, shouldn't use bunk beds. It's odd that they didn't bother to notify you and believed it was okay. You gave it a shot and were courteous when it didn't work, so you made other plans.", "Doesn\u2019t matter.  They should have given up the master rather than put their pregnant DIL through that, and they definite,y should not have complained about him and wife leaving under those circumstances,  they should have apologized, scolded their entitled daughters and forced them into the bunk beds, and paid for the hotel if they were remotely worthwhile humans, but now OP and wife can cut them out entirely and they can never meet their grandchild since they are AHs!  Or at least they can squirm a bit.\n\nBut seriously, I get that pregnancy isn\u2019t an excuse to force your husband and family out on a 3 am search for the hardest ever to find kind of ice cream, but it is a perfectly good reason to go stay in a hotel rather than this male cow\u2019s fecal matter!", "I\u2019m not defending OP\u2019s family. I was just thing to point out that we don\u2019t know if this was intentional or if there was a miscommunication during the booking process. OP\u2019s said that his parents did offer to switch rooms after the first night but OP didn\u2019t feel that was fair. If I were in OP\u2019s shoes I wouldn\u2019t want someone to be uncomfortable so I can be comfortable. I agree with the decision OP made. It was the most mature way to handle it.

I think you may need to look deeper into how they normally treat her, as by the sounds of it, you are the only son/brother. Are there some  conflict/bad feelings you aren't aware of?", "NTA. Has your family always treated you like this? That's pretty fucked up to do that to you and then get mad at you for booking a hotel.", "N T A she is pregnant.

Hard NTA. Blech.", "Nta, what did they think to get a highly pregnant woman a bunk bed to sleep.

Seriously, F your family for trying to make an extremely pregnant woman sleep on a kiddie bunk bed. \n\nAnd what the hell were you thinking even trying to put up with that nonsense?", "NTA. Tell them it's pretty clear that they are distancing themselves from you as instead of booking a place with enough proper beds, or even have the decency to put someone else with the bunk beds, they put the only pregnant woman into the most uncomfortable and unsuitable bed and that they surely would know the outcome.\n\nThen instead of offering to switch beds you acted put out when we had to take action. Real family would never have put a pregnant woman in that position or insisted somehow we're the problem when the problem was created by the rest of them and they made zero effort to fix it.", "Nta what a bunch of ahs.", "NTA. I'm not sure I would have even tried it, so you are both more accommodating than I am, by giving this setup a chance.

Your family is the AH", "And you cannot tell me either of the sisters would have taken a bunk bed if they were pregnant. What  a handful of jokers.", "This whole set up sounds like a passive/aggressive power move.", " changed the place you reserved? That's allowed?", "Probably physically exhausted as well which you should not discount. Please give yourselves some patience and grace. From here it sounds like you handled everything well.", "Honestly, with the price of Air BNBs and VRBOs, I'd rather pay for the privacy of a hotel room. Especially if there's free breakfast involved.", "Bunk beds CAN be safe and comfortable. Not sure why you say they shouldn\u2019t be used?\n\n\nI agree, any kid-sized bed (even twin size) is probably going to be too small for an adult who is used to sleeping in a full or queen bed, and it\u2019s rude to give it to an adult guest without letting them know first", "NTA, heck I would be absolutely embarrassed and melt into a puddle if I made a pregnant woman sleep in a horribly uncomfortable bed.", "Pregnant women are somewhat off balance and a fall can be fatal for the fetus. Pregnant women also have to pee a lot so this accommodation is not at all suitable. I might expect a 6 year old to think this was ok as they wouldn\u2019t know any better.", "If I am the one to arrange the accommodation. I would be so ashamed that I would either switch the room or pay for a hotel room. I don't get those people. Do they have no shame?", "Can't make a pregnant woman sleep in an uncomfortable bed if it's so uncomfortable that she can't fall asleep.\n\n*Taps head*", "I think it's implied that the pregnant woman would have the lower bunk.", "Since the OP seems to be a reasonable person who cares about his wife being comfortable I think it's safe to assume he took the top bunk.\n\nThe lower part of a bunk bed might be a little more difficult to get out of than a single bed (since you need to navigate past the ladder and avoid banging your head when standing up) but the main (and entirely reasonable) problem according to OP is that the beds weren't even slightly comfortable.", "The fall can still be fatal for the foetus."]}
