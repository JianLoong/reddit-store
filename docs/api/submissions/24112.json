Communicate to your partner that you're uncomfortable and you would like them to stop.", "NTA - one reason why, doesn\u2019t your partner realise it\u2019s upsetting you?", "NTA\n\nIt's clear that this is making you uncomfortable and is a discussion you need to have with your partner.", "NTA. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t be willing to put up with it at all. It\u2019s inappropriate for a person in a relationship.", "NTA. It\u2019s cheating, 100%.", "Nta. My spouse and I met through online rpgs. We had a discussion about our limits when ring with other people and neither of us were comfortable with the other doing xrated rp with someone else. Romance between characters in a d&d game is fine but no xrated stuff  between one of us and another person.\n\nI will warn you if your boundary is one your SO does not respect then you two may not be compatible.", "I played ffxiv for a bit, joined a guild, which ended up crumbling after the couple that ran it had this exact thing happen. The girl was supposed to only be an rp barwench, but somehow she started erping, which somehow led to physical affairs. I never got the full story, but they divorced, and the husband wouldn't play anymore. The game brought him no joy after that. I'm not saying that will happen, but it's a slippery slope.", "Everyone who is saying it's cheating has no idea what roleplaying in this context is. people writing films or series where people fuck are not cheating on their partner. people writing erotic novels are not cheating on their partners. it's like playing barbies. you're not thinking about the person controlling the other character at all, you're thinking about putting your character in (erotic) situations. \n\nhowever, NTA. if it's eating you and you have not discussed it again, in a real way, since the first time, I think it's worth it to bring it up. compatibility in a relationship has many facets, and this one sounds like one that doesn't have to be ignored and dismissed. I wish you the best outcome out of this.", "So, I am a writer and roleplayer. I absolutely do not consider this cheating. It is NOT the same as sexting. Characters and fictional situations are NOT you.\n\nHOWEVER. Your fiance has disregarded your discomfort, so I think you wnbta if you bring it up again to have a serious discussion about it. But I would be prepared, because it sounds like this might be a deal breaker for you, and if they don\u2019t care about that, then they are choosing their fun over your comfort. \n\nEvery relationship looks different, and you & your fiance need to decide together what those lines are for you. I wish you luck & hope communication wins out for you!", "NTA - it\u2019s weird", "OP,\n\nMy apologies, but is your partner \u201cgetting off\u201d to these rep stories? Does it involve her, or others masturbating? Does your partner \u201cget off\u201d to these stories mentally?\n\nNow, the masturbation does not have to occur act the time of writing.\n\nI would be very interested to see what messages that they send each other say. \n\nTo me, personally, this would tend to be sexting - which is cheating (unless agreed otherwise).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Be very careful who you marry.", "Well, we\u2019ve had the conversation that I don\u2019t feel comfortable with it recently, and they\u2019ve said \u2018it\u2019s just for fun\u2019 and that since it\u2019s not actually cheating, then I shouldn\u2019t worry about it.", "That's just blatantly disrespectful to you and your feelings towards what they're doing. It doesn't have to be cheating in the physical sense to be considered cheating. There are things like emotional cheating, physical cheating, and yes, cyber cheating. What your partner is doing falls under cyber cheating.\n\nBut regardless of if they believe they are cheating or not, the fact of the matter is it's causing you distress, you aren't comfortable with it, and they should have the respect for you to stop the activity.", "You need to get her to listen, very sad for you.\n\nI would say she is most certainly on the path to cheat on you if not all ready. Her respect for your feelings is callous and that\u2019s a bad sign.\n\nPlus just the blatant disrespect which no parter should do to each other. She is effectively saying she doesn\u2019t love you. \n\nI understand people have different relationships of course but they respect each others feelings, disrespect especially when disregarded brushed away is a sure sign things are doomed.\n\nNTA- likely just to much of a good guy", "In a way, their partner is actively cheating. There is a thing called cyber cheating or cyber infidelity. What OP's partner very much falls under that category. Cheating doesn't have to strictly be a physical thing.", "Of course but there is some openness allowed in the relationship , just it crossed a line like OP said.", "The problem is the partner isn't respecting OP's feelings about it AT ALL and just brushing it off like it was nothing.", "Exactly,\nI don\u2019t think OP is recognising how big of a deal it is.", "If my partner was doing something like this and KNEW I wasn\u2019t comfortable with it and just completely dismissed it like this, that\u2019s basically game over, relationship is doomed from that point on. There\u2019s just no salvaging it after such a fundamental disrespect.", "Agree, I\u2019d be long gone too.", "NTA anyone who participates in erp or writing NSFW fiction is obviously getting off to it. If you consider her getting off with other people cheating then I think most people would agree. Writing fictional stories alone is one thing, but messaging back and forth is almost sexting like r/dirtypenpals but in this scenario its inside a video game", "NTA. \n\nDo it now. Trust your feelings of discomfort. \n\nYour fiance is going places you do not want to a) follow, b) share\n\n\"It's only words\" is both true and BS. Your fiance is having a kind of erotic affair with these people and you're not comfortable. Ask them to stop; if they refuse, perhaps your time together is over.", "NTA. It is about boundaries and it's not even a uncommon boundary. They're sexually involved with others, and you're not comfortable with that.", "You need to have a sit down and agree on what your boundaries are and what y'all consider cheating. Maybe she can write R-rated fanfic as a compromise as that doesn't include engaging directly with others?", "NTA I bet this game is FFXIV. He\u2019s not just sexting he is definitely cheating. People have like full blown relationships and marriages and get super fucking weird about it. He probably has a MMO girlfriend he RPs with too, there\u2019s also a ton of NSFW mods that basically make it a porn game (to the point that you can pair wireless vibrators to the actions in game)", "I\u2019m going to say NAH. As someone who\u2019s been a frequent participant in online RP, ERPs aren\u2019t necessarily always because you have any feelings between yourself and someone else/have any interest in getting off to what you write, but I definitely think your partner would be TA if they didn\u2019t understand your discomfort and cut it out.", "NAH. \n\nI used to be in D'n'D community in my late teens-young adulthood. I don't see this as cheating, I would be comfortable with my husband doing it (I am viciously against cheating and would not accept/forgive it). \n\nI can understand your discomfort as well, since you are not in the scene and don't have any personal experience. It just comes down to whether it is a deal-breaker for you as a couple.", "This is actually NOT the same as sexting. I also do writing-based roleplaying and anything I do with my characters is solely as a writer controlling their character, it has nothing to do with who I am or how I feel as a real life person.\n\nI do a lot of erotic writing with my characters but that doesn't translate to any kind of chemistry with the people I'm writing with. Heck, personally I'm asexual, but I enjoy the drama and character development that comes from said writing, which is why I do it.\n\nNAH. OP doesn't understand this kind of roleplaying, but I do think they should have a proper discussion on this. It might be a deal breaker for either one, or both.", "From my understanding her partner is ERPing with other ppl how is that similar to writing erotica or something?If her partner is talking intimately for hours with other ppl sexually/emotionally. Like they would rather go play a MMO and flirt with people there then do it with their partner. And I bet you their RP are not super deep or complex shit, it\u2019s just an excuse to look at cute girl characters in a game and flirt with people, their RPing going to a bar and picking up people while in a committed relationship basically.", "Your argument makes no sense because if op's SO doing it for the \"love of writing\" then why can't they just write about it instead of bringing another person in to do it in real-time? \n\nAlso it doesn't matter if OP's SO isn't getting connected to the other person, some of these people DO consider it a real connection and it opens a whole new can of worms and problems. \n\nIf OP isn't comfortable with it, he should tell them how he feels, and they can either stop or they can break up since it would mean they are not compatible if it's so important to them they are willing to lose OP over it..", "Nope sorry but that totally is sexting", "Don't project what you consider 'normal' on others and say \"they don't understand it\" as if that invalidates everything they say. The inability to understand that everyone's tolerance is different does not mean it's a carte blanche to dictate others what they should or should not tolerate from their SO when it comes to their own sexuality (morally deviant behaviour being the exception).", "Because writing with other people is an actual thing people enjoy doing? I've been doing it for 15+ years it's a BIG community. It's more enjoyable writing with another person than solo, and a completely different kind of writing exercise (writing and controlling every character vs not knowing what other characters will do and have to write based off other's ideas).\n\nThat's exactly why I said NAH. OP is fine to have those feelings but their partner is also in the right to have this hobby if they want. It doesn't make either of them the AH, they just need to have a conversation about it before jumping to \"er ma gerd this is 1000% cyber cheating!!!\" Like everyone on here is.\n\nReddit is wild"]}
