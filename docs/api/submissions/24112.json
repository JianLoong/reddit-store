Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t be willing to put up with it at all. It\u2019s inappropriate for a person in a relationship.", "NTA. It\u2019s cheating, 100%.", "Nta. My spouse and I met through online rpgs. We had a discussion about our limits when ring with other people and neither of us were comfortable with the other doing xrated rp with someone else. Romance between characters in a d&d game is fine but no xrated stuff  between one of us and another person.\n\nI will warn you if your boundary is one your SO does not respect then you two may not be compatible.", "I played ffxiv for a bit, joined a guild, which ended up crumbling after the couple that ran it had this exact thing happen. The girl was supposed to only be an rp barwench, but somehow she started erping, which somehow led to physical affairs. I never got the full story, but they divorced, and the husband wouldn't play anymore. The game brought him no joy after that. I'm not saying that will happen, but it's a slippery slope.", "Everyone who is saying it's cheating has no idea what roleplaying in this context is. people writing films or series where people fuck are not cheating on their partner. people writing erotic novels are not cheating on their partners. it's like playing barbies. you're not thinking about the person controlling the other character at all, you're thinking about putting your character in (erotic) situations. \n\nhowever, NTA. if it's eating you and you have not discussed it again, in a real way, since the first time, I think it's worth it to bring it up. compatibility in a relationship has many facets, and this one sounds like one that doesn't have to be ignored and dismissed. I wish you the best outcome out of this.", "So, I am a writer and roleplayer. I absolutely do not consider this cheating. It is NOT the same as sexting. Characters and fictional situations are NOT you.\n\nHOWEVER. Your fiance has disregarded your discomfort, so I think you wnbta if you bring it up again to have a serious discussion about it. But I would be prepared, because it sounds like this might be a deal breaker for you, and if they don\u2019t care about that, then they are choosing their fun over your comfort. \n\nEvery relationship looks different, and you & your fiance need to decide together what those lines are for you. I wish you luck & hope communication wins out for you!", "NTA - it\u2019s weird", "OP,\n\nMy apologies, but is your partner \u201cgetting off\u201d to these rep stories? Does it involve her, or others masturbating? Does your partner \u201cget off\u201d to these stories mentally?\n\nNow, the masturbation does not have to occur act the time of writing.\n\nI would be very interested to see what messages that they send each other say. \n\nTo me, personally, this would tend to be sexting - which is cheating (unless agreed otherwise).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
