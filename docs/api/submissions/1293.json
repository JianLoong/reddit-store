I have to say that since my family are non practicing christians, he always criticizes them saying they're hypocrites. and is always uncomfortable spending so much time with them.\n\n\nThe one he doesn't get along with mostly is my sister, He thinks she's living carelessly and irresponsibly. I told him to keep his opinion to himself and told her to ignore him as a compromise.\n\n\nChristmas is usually spent with family. This year, my sister announced that she wanted to bring her new bf with her for christmas celebration. My husband was rather annoyed by this and said he wouldn't attend this year's christmas celebration if my sister bring her bf. I asked why and he said because it makes him uncomfortable. He told me he'd go if I ask my sister to not bring her new bf.\n\n\nI went to visit mom and saw my sister there. I brought up the possibility of my husband missing out on this year's christmas celebration and asked her if she'd reconsider bringing her bf. She asked why and I said that it makes my husband uncomfortable. I explained that the family known my husband for years and it's not fair that he misses the event so her bf of 4 months can come. She asked what she was supposed to do and I asked if she'd reconsider bringing her bf, I think he wouldn't care that much about it anyway compared to my husband. She nonchantly said that maybe my husband should not come \"if it's a big deal for him\". I lashed out at her for saying that and told her that she had no respect nor regard for my husband who's a family member and is considered family for years. She had an attitude basically saying it was not her problem. It escalated and mom urged me to go home and I did.\n\n\nUtter silence on my husband's side, but mom and dad are upset with me for what happened and said that I'm putting unnecesary pressure on my sister and making her feel guilty for the situation my husband created. They suggested I apologize but I said I needed time to see what happens.\n\nOkay, I feel like I should include that a fair number of family (my dad's side) are pressuring my husband to come. They were shocked and upset after they found out he may not be attending. He has a good relationship with them.", "created_utc": 1667584452, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym5lch/aita_for_lashing_out_at_my_sister_when_she_said/", "score": 234, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Specifically, you're right that your sister has no respect for your husband, but this is because he is not behaving in a fashion worthy of respect.

I'll answer for you since you won't say exactly why your husband has an issue with it, it's because he's just a boyfriend and not married. Cause my God, that would be blasphemy! OP, your husband is trying to control your family with religion and that's absurd. He's a grown man, he can stay home if ha ING your sister's boyfriend bothers him so much. That's his choice.

I don't even understand how he's managed to brain wash you this much considering you don't practice Christianity.", "YTA - just because you're willing to do whatever he wants doesn't mean anyone else has to.  Your husband is incredibly judgmental and has no right to dictate how the rest of your family spends Christmas.", "YTA, this is why I dislike religious people. This holier than thou attitude towards your sister, and you just going along with it. He is being judgmental and your allowing him to disrespect your family in the process. Pick either your husband and lose your family, or your family and lose your husband, but until you do, these conflicts will keep happening.", "YTA It's not your husband's Christmas, it's your family's Christmas.

Why should your husband call the shots?", "YTA - And so is your husband.  Why is he uncomfortable?  Has he vocalized that or is just that he is one of those that believe he has the right to infringe on other people's houses his beliefs.  And what do you believe?

Your husband sounds like an insufferable whiny twit who loves to remind everyone around him how \u201choly\u201d he is. Jesus was the son of God and he didn\u2019t go to parties telling everyone how great he was. He lived a peaceful life and preached forgiveness and love, if your husband were such a great Christian he would be like Jesus but instead he\u2019s out dictating who gets to come to your parents house.

Your husband is the one with the random issue. It's on him and you to deal with that.

Heck even you don't seem to share his beliefs, how do you listen to it all day every day?", "YTA. You asked, she denied, you were angry because your ask was not an ask, was a demand.

What you want is time to find an excuse for saying it's not his fault and get out of dealing with your husbands behaviour.

Y'all should just have Christmas by your selves.", "YTA. Your husband has no reason not to go. What is so wrong with this boyfriend? Also yeah he utterly sucks for complaining about no practicing Christians. Or rather people who may not practice the same way he does.

I'm guessing you'll never understand why, since I can't imagine what sort of mental gymnastics you have to do everyday, to justify your husband's puritanical belief system,  but somehow make it his but not yours.", "YTA - its a real simple solution. If your husband is uncomfortable then HE shouldn't go. They are HIS convictions that he is holding onto so strongly. What all does he have against the BF? Oh!

Your sister will not refrain from having a good personal life and bring her bf to family events simply because your husband is a controlling close-minded man.

You did the same thing by asking her to exclude her bf.", "YTA.  Your husband is the one with the problem.  He can be the one to stay home.

LOL \n\nYour husband doesn't even like your family but you expect them to bend over backward to accommodate him. What exactly entitles you to have your partner there, that doesn't apply to your sister? That you're married and she isn't? Because that's a religion-funded value, and you admitted you and your family aren't religious. If you converted, or simply got used to submitting to your husband's beliefs, that's your problem, not your family's. \n\nYour sister has zero reasons to prevent herself from spending Christmas with her parents and her boyfriend, in order to appease a man who openly dislikes her and badmouths her. \n\nIf your husband doesn't like that the boyfriend is coming, he can stay home.

Would he have her never bring a bf until it\u2019s a husband?? \n\nSo you go and ask, and are told no. Then you push it?

You know what? My sibs and I were always welcome to invite our boyfriends and girlfriends to holiday celebrations, and my parents welcomed them. If any of our spouses had ever stated what your AH husband did, we\u2019d laugh our asses off and (sarcastically) tell our in-law how much we\u2019d miss him or her at the party. \n\nWhy don\u2019t you and your angelic husband (/s) spend Christmas together alone and leave everyone else in peace? \n\nDo you truly not recognize what a pompous AH he is?", "YTA (you and your husband).

He is the one that does not want to make a compromise at all, so your family should not compromise at all.\n\nOn another note, if he is such a religous perso why he is so judgy, only God in most religions can judge so he seems not to be a great person.", "Sounds more like your husband has no respect and no regard for your family, so with that in mind both you and your husband are ta.", "YTA.

It was your husbands decision to not go.\n\n>She nonchantly said that maybe my husband should not come \"if it's a big deal for him\".\n\nI agree with her.
