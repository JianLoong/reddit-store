She's not old enough to go to school or come home by herself. In our country, school starts in the morning (7-8 am) and ends at noon (12 or 1 pm). There's no such thing as school bus or whatsoever. The school has an afterschool class, but it's not free, thus it's not mandatory. I however enrolled my daughter there, mainly so she can be watched until me or my husband finish work.\n\nThis week I took some time off work in order to run some errands including taking my daughter to the dentist. The appointment was at 1:30 pm and she finished school at 1 pm so we were in a rush.\n\nAt 1 pm I was at the gate of the school waiting impatiently for her. I specified her beforehand that we're in a rush and she should hurry after the end of the class. At ten past one there's still no sign of my daughter, or any other kid from her class. Me and the other parents discussed calling the teacher, but decided to wait some more. No kid from the class showed up sooner than quarter past one. When my daughter arrived, I rushed her to the car in hopes we may still make it. With the whole lunch traffic we arrived there at almost 2 pm and essentially lost the appointment.\n\nI asked my daughter what on Earth happened and she told me one of her classmates didn't do an assignment for the last class (because he was playing instead or something like this) and the teacher forced them all to wait for him. In her exact words \"nobody leaves until Billy finishes the task!\"\n\nNow, I have three kids, my daughter being the youngest, but I never punish all them for one's mistake. I don't see why my daughter, who did all the tasks on time and was well behaved, would have to suffer because her colleague didn't. It wasn't even a team project or anything. I had to take more time off work to take my daughter to the dentist another time.\n\nThe next day I went to the teacher and asked her to stop practicing collective punishment. If there's one kid who fell behind and she feels like he can't leave without finishing, she should hold back only him. I told her I don't want neither my daughter nor myself to suffer because of some random bad kid. She got mad saying she doesn't tell me how to do my job and I should mind my own business, because I don't understand what means to be a teacher. (Joke's on her, I was an assistant junior coach in college so I really have experience with kids) I got mad and said that as long as her job will include my daughter, I will stand for what's the best for her.\n\nShe didn't quite call me the AH, you can imagine why, but she made remarks about being entitled and so on. It got me thinking maybe I should let it go and that it's not a big deal so Aita?", "created_utc": 1669908342, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9qmvo/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_kids_teacher/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Collective Punishment is using bullying as a teaching tool, literally asking the peers to bully the child in the future to avoid similar punishments. And that's to say nothing of the additional complications caused if you or another parent had been late for work and been fired for violating attendance policies, or if you had been fined for missing the appointment, is the teacher prepared to pay those fines if she caused your fees?

Collective punishment is asinine. \n\nI don't usually suggest escalating things, but what the teacher is doing is ridiculous.", "Teacher here.

Wow, \"Everyone is punished because one kid did bad\" is such an outdated thing that you don't hear about it in the wild very often these days.

This isn't a valuable life lesson for American kids, it's just cruel.", "NTA. Collective punishment is fucked. Plus, she was out of line holding them past the end of the day. Incredibly inconsiderate of all of the students and parents' schedules. Normally, I'm on the side of teachers, but this was dumb.", "NTa, and should have just gone to the principal directly. If your kid had an appointment, she had no right detaining him due to the behavior of another kid.\n\nTeacher is flexing her \"AUTHORITAH!\" and is out of line.", "ESH.\n\nThough it\u2019s not common to practice in western culture, collective punishment is still common in certain countries where group pressure helps keep everyone in check and are more community oriented. It has pros and cons like any other educational tactic. I\u2019m not going to argue over the fact that it\u2019s beneficial or not to the kids. You have everyright to express that you\u2019re unhappy with the unfairness that naturally comes from this tactic and talk to a supervisor about it if you want to make it stop. Talk to the school headers.

Once school hours are over, students are free to go, because students *and* parents have other things in their lives that they need to do (like dentist appointments!).  Holding kids after class, without any notice to the parents, has serious real-world consequences.\n\nOP should have brought this issue up with an administrator.  A principal, school board, someone who has authority to tell the teacher to not keep children after school anymore.  Because despite what OP seems to believe, she does **not** have the authority to walk into that classroom and tell the teacher how to do her job.  Yeah, there are a lot of issues with group punishments, but they\u2019re entirely too common and you\u2019re fighting a losing battle if you try to get them banned altogether.  The real issue is keeping students after class.\n\nThe school, and that teacher, could be held liable for the cost of the missed dentist appointment, the cost of OP\u2019s missed wages (because now they have to take *another* day off work to go to the dentist again), plus any other costs for other parents that were incurred by their children being held after class unexpectedly and unnecessarily.\n\nMarching into the classroom telling the teacher how to run their class (and claiming you know how to work with kids because you were \u201can assistant junior coach\u201c?) solves nothing, and this is an issue that *needs* to be solved.", "NTA. That's ridiculous! The teacher has literally NO AUTHORITY to do that. After the school day is over, they have no power over the kids. And you can't hold kids in a classroom after school! I hope this situation works out in your favor OP, and Happy Holidays.", "NTA - Go to the head of the school.

Beyond the obvious that you\u2019ve already described of how this makes no sense to do to anyone with children specifically it can be incredibly harmful to practice collective punishment. Kids are extremely impressionable creatures and as any bullied child will tell you they are absolutely susceptible to mob mindset on top of it. If one kid decides that was enough of a reason to bully that kid every kid in that class is likely to follow. Those kids are being told look what this kid caused. You get less free time to hang out with your friends or go home to your family because of this child. Your happiness is lost not because of me, but because of this child. Honestly this kind of punishment isn\u2019t just an issue because of the trouble it caused for you and your kid but because of the moral issue it presents. A child becoming a massive target for bullying and mistreatment by every other kid in that class and all their friends who might not even take that class because of one silly mistake they made because they are a child who does not yet know better. And all those children are learning that when something goes wrong they all are going to be punished even if they didn\u2019t cause the problem so from then on they are going to lose hope and become paranoid the moment one misstep is made by anyone around them because their instinct is going to be their life is going to become worse because Shanon across the street started an argument with her husband on the front porch that morning. They\u2019re going to become bitter towards everyone for making small simple mistakes or even just perceived mistakes that have no consequences on them whatsoever because their instinct will be that it will have consequences on them. And on top of that the kid who actually did make the mistake of not doing his homework is being taught that the moment he fucks up everyone is going to hate him so what\u2019s the point in trying? Why make friends if the moment you prove to be a non-perfect person like literally everyone else in the world is they\u2019re all going to turn on you and bully you? Why bother with anything social at all if everyone is just going to hate you? And to top it all off as you described other parents seemed worried about their children. Everyone was convening to see if any of their children had come out yet because nobody had seen their child. For all any of you knew something seriously dangerous could\u2019ve been going on and you were just left there to worry while your children were left inside and nobody was reassured their child was safe and sound and where they should be. There is a reason collective punishment is considered a war crime by the Geneva convention. It\u2019s not reasonable by any means and especially should not be used against children.", "NTA \n\nThat\u2019s ridiculous! Instead of punishing the whole class she needs to talk to that student\u2019s parents about their behavior. You had every right to be mad.", "Total NTA. You didn\u2019t do anything. She\u2019s TA.", "NTA. Same situation happened with my child and it caused her to miss the school bus, which meant she had to walk 25 minutes home and I had to leave work early to get my younger daughter off the bus. Teachers shouldn't punish the whole class for one student. It's not fair.", "Info: is there anything within the schools policy that\u2019s allows her to keep the kids after the school day ends? If there is how long is she actually permitted to keep them? Also if you just went into the main office and demanded to collect your daughter would the teacher have any grounds to stop you or the other parents?\nRegardless Nta, asking more to give helpful advice", "NTA. Teachers don't get to punish children outside of school hours. Daycare and pickups and bussing and joint custody means a lot of kids have complicated arrangements and you don't throw off the schedule of 30+ adults because you can't manage your class. Go speak to the principal and lodge a complaint", "NTA. Speaking as both a former teacher and student of a teacher who practiced  \u2018collective punishment\u2019, all it does is prove that the teacher is shit at their job and will make the poor kid who was the cause of said punishment a target for bullying.", "ESH. I understand that maybe your dentist is nearby but I don't think you gave yourself enough time. Expect at least 5 minutes for students to collect their things and get to the exit gate. Then a few minutes to get safely to your car and leave the parking lot. Too many parents rush through school parking lots and it's dangerous. You still need to check in at the dentist and don't you make time to brush your teeth before a dental appointment? Yes, you could've made it, but very rushed and stressed from being in traffic. I understand the teacher's punishment wasn't correct, but you should plan for delays especially if you're not used to picking her up at that time. You could have called the school office to have her released early or let them know she had an appointment so don't delay her.", "You: NTA\n\nBut this is your fault\u2014not the teacher's. \n\n\"The appointment was at 1:30 pm and she finished school at 1 pm so we were in a rush.\"\n\nThe rest of it is totally the teacher's fault\u2014and I would remind her that this isn't fucking boot camp where everyone gets punished for one person not making their bed right. Groups like to single out scapegoats, and **kids are the worst**. \n\nThe idea of punishing an entire class for one person's mistake, plus being told to mind your own business, plus the rest = \"Imma get you fired\" in the US. \n\nGranted, I don't know how things work where you are\u2014but there's no way in hell I would let a teacher talk to me like this. And I have a lot of respect for teachers, because I know the job is challenging.", "NAH.  Teacher made a decision that you didn't agree with.   The confrontation made you feel better.  But, the teacher will do what she thinks is best.", " NTA.  \nThe teacher is not instilling whatever lesson she hopes Billy will learn. In fact, she\u2019s making it so that there is resentment towards Billy and creating classroom management issues for herself.", "ESH  Collective punishment is bad no doubt.  And that teacher's pushback was some AH behavior.  However, she held them for 15 minutes.  You said you didn't get to the dentist til 30 minutes after  your appointment time.  Those 15 minutes MIGHT have saved your appointment, but a lot of places cut you off 5-10  minutes after appointment time.  Heck, some specialists I've been to won't see you if you aren't 15 minutes EARLY since you \"won't have time to do the paperwork\"  If you have a tight schedule, notify the teacher (or administration whichever is appropriate in your locale) beforehand and just go get your kid out of class when it's time to go.", "LOL I would\u2019ve loved to have you as a classmate \ud83d\udc80", "Someone tried that on my HS history teacher.\n\nHis reply:\n\n\"Geneva convention doesn't apply to what the state does to its own people, only enemy combatants\".\n\nThe state can (and does) use chemical weapons, kill non combatants, torture it's citizens, and use collective punishment just fine.
