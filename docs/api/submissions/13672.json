But it's also unreasonable of her to expect that you leave your wife alone in her grief.

His daughter picked that day after everything happened, knowing that OP likely would not come if the wedding was that day. \n\nHe is grieving - it's been less than a year since his infant daughter passed away. Unless you have been through that, how could you possibly say that it would be a better way to celebrate by leaving his wife alone to go to a wedding with people he probably does not even know well other than his daughter and daughter's mom?", "I have 3 children. Call me a bad mum if you want but If one of my children decided to schedule a wedding on the birth date of their sibling, I would be pulling them aside immediately to ask them what their issue is. This is even worse as it\u2019s the birth date of their DECEASED sibling. \n\nWhy must there be so little empathy towards your family that you decide to schedule an event on a date that is important to another person in your immediate family? Why steal their spotlight? How many more stories of scape goated children do we need before compassion happens?", "I\u2019m finding this sun is just a bunch of teenagers angry at their parents. Every post I see about a parent grieving or being upset that mildly inconveniences another child seems to set people off. \n\nThe day of your wedding is honestly something people put way too much stock in. Most people just pick a day their venue has available and pretend it means something. If either set of parents asked my wife and I to move our wedding day we would have done it without question. Because we love our parents and know they would only ask if it were important.", "I'm sorry for your loss", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "No but they had other days unless he also proposed on that day or the first time they kissed or the first time they had S3x or any other first but chose the first time they MET not even their first date but he day they met", "Your right. I did think about this after I posted. My son was 2 weeks early. (or on due date. Depends on which Dr you talk to)\n\nBut the way ops post reads (and from other comments I'm not if it's 100% accurate) then the daughter chose the date after the birth/death of baby. Which means that she new that date and what it would mean.\n\nFrom reading more from other comments I actually don't know what to think and honestly kinda regret weighing in. It is a really shitty day and if I lost my son I know I would be a wreck on his birthday and death day. So no way would I be going to a wedding. And if another child planned a wedding on that day I would be hurt beyond belief. But apparently they didn't have much of a relationship so who knows what the actual story is behind all this is.", "You seem to have misunderstood. She was definitely invited. As was everyone who is most special to us.", "Why do you say that? Did you see the guest list?", "OP states it was announced after the baby died. We don\u2019t know when they actually decided. They likely discussed possible wedding dates well before they announced based on the timeline. Most couples do.", "I mean, if she can't plan around something like this, it clearly shows how less she values him. Fair enough I guess, but then there's no need to get upset if he doesn't attend.", "Then you can\u2019t be upset that he can\u2019t come?", "Man, the kid was her half-sibling, too -- it's not like she's not related to it, too.", "OP stated she stopped coming during the summers once she hit her teen years. Nothing he can do about it then but keep trying. If she doesn't want to be in his life there's not much he can do.

It's not comparable.", "Now that\u2019s a pretty big assumption isn\u2019t it? I may get downvoted for this but where I live COVID shutdown was like years ago. I think countering the argument with this isn\u2019t credible.", "Or \n\n\"Dad isnt here today cause he is mourning the loss of my half sister on her birthday. Im not sure if he would have even come if i had made it another day in march as she died in march and they could still be mourning\"  \n\n\nHonestly mourning the loss of a child doesnt really end you need to learn that you need to do things that day like work or attend weddings. I lost twins at 20 weeks. I made my wedding day the day they would have been full term had they been viable. Now on that day i can celebrate the life they would have had and its doubly special. \n\nEveryone is seeing this as a ah move of the daughter and i know she didnt set this day as her wedding day to remember her sister but could be when she celebrates her anniversary in future years she reaches out to her father and remembers that her sister was born on this day.", "Go ahead and read the very first sentence of the post.

Ok buddy", "Thank you so much \ud83d\udc95", "how is the day the daughter met her now husband more emotionally important than the day OP's baby would've turned 1 year old if she didn't, you know, die as an infant. did daughter expect her dad to be super super happy at her wedding while he is painfully aware this is the day he was supposed to celebrate his baby's birthday? all the milestones his dead baby would've reached by now? i know people who lost children, and the birthday and/or death day (which are sometimes the same day) will always be a day they choose to allow themselves to be sad and mourn even years later, because the death of a child will stay with a parent forever. incredibly insensitive of daughter to insist on this day because \"well i met my hubby on this date years ago\"", "Nah, a meet cute doesn't supersede what should have been a baby's FIRST birthday.", "OP said 3/25 is the day his daughter met her husband. OP is TA", "Daughter also knows all the missing missing reasons OP left out. Including reason 1st marriage ended, what there relationship was like before and after, as well as how few years there are between the ages of OPs daughter and OPs wife.", "39 and I don\u2019t agree.

She probably had this planned a lot longer than you realize and couldn\u2019t change the date in risk of losing money and venue. A lot of your comments play her up as the bad guy, reality is that she\u2019s not, and you\u2019ve probably been to blinded from the pain to notice. \n\nI do suggest that you and your wife get counseling to help with the process of mourning your loss. You missed out on a pretty important moment, and honestly you can\u2019t let this impact other important moments in the future. If you spend too many years mulling over losses, you won\u2019t be able to enjoy the great things to come, I speak from experience. You\u2019re probably a little too old to start over again with kids, and you\u2019re going to have grandkids sometime in the near future. You haven\u2019t been there for your daughter, and if you\u2019re going to have any shot of having a future connection and relationship with her and your future grandkids, you need to start working on that now rather than later.", "you never cared about her feelings for what, 20 years and more? Do you REALLY know how much your neglect and abseentism hurt your living daughter? \n\nWhy do you deserve her compassion now when she never got any of yours growing up?", "You had her whole life to move to the province your daughter lived in in order to be more involved in her life.

OP\u2019s situation as a whole sounds crappy, and a lot of hurt feels on all ends. I just hope him and his wife get the help they need to help with the mourning process.", "Yeah, I also go back and forth. There's a ton of grief for OP, but if he doesn't have much of a relationship with his daughter, then it's a bit of a poison pill for her to upend planning (other guests and lost deposits) for a weak relationship. OP claims that she could have chosen 364 other days, but that's not really true, since he's likely to be a  mourning (totally reasonable!) as he approaches his second daughter's death anniversary.\nIt's an awful situation.", "Your daughter missed your wedding, I'm assuming on purpose, and now she's mad you missed hers when you had a legit reason?

Some places more impacted.\n\nEven w/o covid though you usually have money down before invite the wider audience and over a year planning(so before the passing) is common.

The shutdown was a couple years ago but\u2026 do you not realize that a lot of the weddings scheduled during the shutdown were postponed? And happening over the last two years PLUS the addition of all the couples engaged during the last two years? We couldn\u2019t secure a couple venues we really wanted because they were slammed with COVID postponed weddings. Those weddings that were planned to happen during the shutdown and postponed didn\u2019t just pooof into thin air.", "Agreed. My brother got married near that date and only started planning post covid. It wasn't a short process either!", "You absolutely don\u2019t need to learn that if that\u2019s not what works for you. I take those days off work.", "I did read the first comment of the post.

OP said in another comment that 3/25 is the day his daughter met her husband. He conveniently left that out of the original post.  OP is TA", "That was my first thought. OP is probably around 50 give or take a few years. Current wife is probably at least a decade younger...maybe closer in age to oldest daughter. Daughter may not have been thrilled about the circumstances of new family.", "OP said in a comment he was never in a relationship with his eldest's mom.

He had his daughter at 18 and then the mother moved her away. He as an 18 year old says he starved himself to save enough to get some summers with his daughter until she no longer wanted those visits. The relationship between them is fraught and as the daughter of an absentee dad, I get how painful that is. But I really don't see how he was a shitty absentee father when it seems like he really tried his best given the circumstances?\n\nSometimes our best isn't enough yes, but also -- I don't see anything that indicates callousness as a father. I also have an absentee father and OP's description just doesn't resonate with all the accusations of his character based on the little info we have", "I\u2019m not the one that moved. I\u2019m not the one who kept her from me.

I dont buy it , there must have been at least some wiggle room in there.", "Agree to disagree then. I hope you never have to bury your infant", "THIS comment is the one that makes the most sense. Yes, that part didn't cross my mind.

Why are you assuming the current wife is the same age as the daughter? That's some super weird projection you got going on.", "Aaaaaah so that\u2019s totally different then.
