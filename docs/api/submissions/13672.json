I'm going with NAH. I'm sure the venue and everything was set over a year in advance. And definitely no one should guilt you about choosing to grieve your lost daughter rather than celebrate your living daughter. People grieve how they grieve. I'd also imagine, given that you have an adult daughter, that she did not feel particularly connected to her little sister. I realize that sounds harsh, but in large age gap siblings, that does sometimes happen. The date meant something more to her than it being her sister's birthday, and that's valid. \n\nYou weren't wrong in missing the wedding if you felt it was in your best interest to do so. But you weren't right, either, because your other daughter deserved to have her parent at her side. It's sad that it turned out this way, for all of you.", "I\u2019m shocked at the Y T A comments. Do people realize that the bride was proposed to around the day of her half-sister\u2019s birth, and about 3 months later her half-sibling had died? To be frank, not people even have their venues booked 3 months after they\u2019ve gotten engaged. Even if the daughter did have things booked, I\u2019m sure that the venue(s) would have allowed her to book services for a later day without penalty given the tragedy involved. Yet OP clearly states that his daughter didn\u2019t *want* to change her wedding date bc it was the day she\u2019d met her SO. There\u2019s a stunning lack of compassion that seems to ring in that fact. Her half-sister had died, and whether she herself felt grief, she was aware her father did. Yet she felt it was more important to have her wedding on the day she met her SO than to be sensitive to and make space for her father\u2019s grief. I can\u2019t imagine doing that to anyone I loved. That said, she can do what she wants, but OP is **not** an AH for being in such a state of grief that he\u2019s incapable of celebrating a wedding for one daughter on what would be his recently passed daughter\u2019s **first bday** less than a year after her death, and OP\u2019s ex-SO and her entire family are incredible AHs for sending him scathing messages for missing the wedding.

I also lost my mom and brother nearly a decade ago and I\u2019d still feel the same about them. I hope you and your wife have a strong support system to help carry you through the hard days.", "NTA. That's a hard vote for a girl whose Dad passed before he could walk me down the aisle, but everyone grieves differently and no one should really judge anyone else's grieving process. \n\nI can't imagine losing a child. I can understand your older daughter being hurt you weren't at her wedding, but she knew your ability to be there on that date when she chose it. Besides that date being your deceased daughter's birthday, I also imagine that being at your older daughter's wedding on that important date would have been a painful reminder that you'll never have the chance to walk your younger daughter down the aisle. \n\nWhen it comes to grief, sometimes you have to ignore what others think and focus on taking care of yourself. It sounds like you were up front with your older daughter about that date and chose to do what you needed to do for you and your wife to get through a really hard day. \n\nUnfortunately, your older daughter chose to make her wedding anniversary the same date that will always make you think of what you'd be doing with your younger daughter to cebrate her birthday if she were here, which is a shitty thing to do that will continue to make you conflicted on that date forever because on your older daughter's 15th anniversary you'll be thinking about how your younger daughter would be having her 16th birthday party and if you're in the US you'd be teaching her how to drive. That's a rough combo of emotions to deal with, happiness for your living daughter and pain for your younger daughter and the memories and milestones you never got to make with her.\n\nIf it's not too painful, maybe see if your older daughter would like to watch the wedding videos and go through the wedding albums with you so you can still make some fatherr-daughter memories with her and see her wedding.

Maybe if your daughter can see your grief she may understand how you were in a situation where you needed to prioritize yourself.

I\u2019m blown away by everyone who is going so far as to call the older daughter a disgusting raging narcissist. Based on OP\u2019s comments and the timeline, the older daughter likely didn\u2019t even know her half sister, certainly not enough to have formed a bond, so why should she have to plan her entire wedding around someone she never even met? Sounds like OP was a fairly absent father too, and I imagine it hurt the daughter to hear her father choose the memory of the new baby with the new wife over her wedding day. However, if OP has been absent then it also makes sense that the daughter wouldn\u2019t want to plan her wedding around someone she may have only invited to her wedding out of courtesy and respect.\n\nThat said, her choosing that specific date was still made while aware of its significance to OP, he explained and she went with it anyway, but it\u2019s a special date to her and I think it\u2019s way too much assuming to say she did it intentionally purely to spite OP. It seems like she accepted that going with that date meant OP wouldn\u2019t come, which is why she\u2019s now blowing up at him about it. OP said he\u2019s getting flack from \u201cher side\u201d, but not necessarily anything bad from her. When your baby has been dead less than a year, the grief is still fresh and I would never blame someone for wanting to take time with their spouse/the mother of said child and process their emotions on that day. Honestly to me it just seems like an overall shitty situation with neither side being willing to compromise on what is important to them, but I feel on both sides that is understandable in this scenario and since that\u2019s all the info provided I\u2019m not comfortable fully accusing anyone of assholery here.", "Agreed NAH - dad has every right to be mourning.

As far as I know OP\u2019s wife was not the reason OP and his oldest daughter\u2019s mom broke up. Why would his wife not be invited? It\u2019s common courtesy to give someone traveling from out of town who won\u2019t know anyone at the wedding (or in this case most other attendees will be hostile to) a plus one. \n\n3. OP wasn\u2019t going to the wedding to walk his daughter down the aisle or even have a father/daughter dance I\u2019m guessing. He was just a regular ol\u2019 guest like everyone else. I bet he wasn\u2019t at a special family table, probably at one of the regular guest tables. You can\u2019t make a big deal out of the father of the bride not coming to the wedding if you don\u2019t really consider him as such. \n\n4. OP told his daughter that date would not be possible for him. I\u2019m sure had the wedding been local and he could have just popped in for the ceremony, he would have at least tried. But to attend her actual wedding he would have had to fly across country, with his heart shattering, leaving his wife behind (because she should not be flying across the country for a wedding shes not even invited to- let\u2019s be real people. Her step-daughter treated her with no respect, why must she bend over backward while grieving the loss of her baby that she just grew in her body and birthed? She shouldn\u2019t). To show up to a wedding to just be a guest. And I\u2019m sure that if he did make those sacrifices to be there for her, she would not have appreciated the effort one bit. She would have just complained that he didn\u2019t look joyful at her wedding.\n\nI don\u2019t think anything would have made his oldest daughter happy with OP. I think she likes to be mad at him. I think her mother did a good job of alienating the daughter from the OP and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s the scapegoat for every bad thing that ever happens in her life. She\u2019s an adult now. Time for her to start taking responsibility for her life and it\u2019s direction. \n\nNTA, OP. You put your health and the health of your wife first right now, that is what is most important.

NTA - daughter is.", "I\u2019m sorry, but as the only living child of a family where we lost my only younger sibling - they can celebrate me for the rest of their lives. I am supported and loved. I would be a total heartless asshole to schedule a special event all about me ON THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH OF MY DEAD YOUNGER SIBLING.\n\nShe PURPOSELY SCHEDULED THIS DATE because it was \u201csignificant\u201d to her relationship, when she ALSO KNEW it was the birthday of her father\u2019s DEAD INFANT CHILD - her own half-sister! That is cold-hearted beyond belief. She did not HAVE to schedule that day - and her father TOLD her it would be difficult for him to attend if she CHOSE that day! Ahead of time he told her this!\n\nI cannot fathom asking my parent to choose between their grief and the grief of the mother of that child on the FIRST ANNIVERSARY. It is selfish beyond measure.\n\nMy one parent chose to support and celebrate me, and the other tried to with all his might, but ended up committing a long, slow suicide to depression and alcoholism for eleven years after my brother died. He tried, but didn\u2019t succeed. But even as he was losing that battle and as angry as I was that he didn\u2019t always remember I was here, too, I would never EVER have co-opted any significant anniversary from either his birth or death for my own selfish needs. Especially when that was what was hurting my father so much.\n\nI cannot even begin to fathom scheduling my WEDDING DAY for the first birthday of a child who should be celebrating their first year of life instead of death - especially when that child was my baby sibling.\n\nShit, the only reason my husband even continues to make his birthday a big deal is because he shares it with my late brother and he knows it helps my mother to celebrate A Son on that day, even if it can\u2019t be her biological one. She\u2019s adopted him as her new son and is grateful he incorporates my brother into his own celebrations. It\u2019s important.\n\nParental grief is beyond measure. I have seen it. I have felt the abandonment and anger when a parent cannot shift to realize they have a living child to celebrate and support. My father couldn\u2019t stave off his grief and coping of it to meet two of his three grandchildren. It is real and severe.\n\nI cannot IMAGINE doing this to either of them LESS THAN A YEAR after my brother died, ON HIS BIRTHDAY, when the grief is so raw, you\u2019re only just starting to realize what it means for the rest of your life.\n\nCelebrate me on ever other day. I don\u2019t need to be celebrated and supported on those two very specific anniversaries - and I will be there for them when they come. Just as my mom and husband support me and my step-mom on the anniversary of my father\u2019s death and on HIS birthday.\n\nI heard my mother\u2019s scream and saw her fall to the ground when she got the news. Anyone who has ever heard that mother scream of grief at the loss of their child will never, ever be able to forget it. Ever. It haunts, even through my own grief.\n\nIt has been almost seventeen years since we lost my brother and it\u2019s both as raw as it\u2019s ever been and also a dull, constant ache.\n\nTime does not heal. The pain does not ever go away. It simply becomes a part of you and your life. But certain days and times are sacrosanct, and certain moments are still gut wrenching.\n\nUnless you have been there, do not DARE to speak for the surviving child or in denigration of a parent who lost their child - especially one like the OP who lost her less than a year ago and should be celebrating her first steps and birthday instead of sitting at her graveside.\n\nThe daughter is the asshole, as is her mother who seems to carry just as little empathy as you do.\n\nFuck this woman and her selfishness, and it\u2019s clear you don\u2019t have any personal experience on this matter.", "At first, I agreed with this take, but I realize now that OP doesn\u2019t have simply \u201ca deceased daughter and a living daughter.\u201d He has two daughters.

This means the Saturdays during that time frame have, normally been booked at least a year out, but at a minimum, nine months prior.  If she had already paid a deposit for the venue and any other vendors, she may lose it. \n\nMy question is did she truly ASK about the day or did she say, \u201cGuess what Dad?

Most wedding dates are down to the availability of the ceremony venue, particularly if it is religious, and the availability of the reception venue. \n\nOP lost their child a year ago. Some consideration should have been taken by the couple when choosing the date.

The father gave her ample warning that if she chose that date he would probably not be able to attend. The daughter still went ahead with that date and the dad did not attend\n\n3. The woman that OP had his second daughter with is not the biological mother of the first daughter and OP's first daughter was had with somebody that he knocked up at a party and then after the divorce the mother moved away with her daughter.\n\n4.

I understand that there are probably a bunch of residual emotions left over from the divorce between you and your ex-wife and you starting another family with another woman, but based off the information that you have shared in the comments it sounds like your daughter is being quite cruel to you. I don't care if she was happy or sad that you were having a second child but to not even reach out with support after you lost a daughter is just cruel. Furthermore, I know it is her wedding day but, frankly, it sounds like she had no empathy for your situation; she chose to keep her wedding on the same day after you expressed your concern for being able to attend and then was mad you didn't. She can't have her cake and eat it too. \n\nI'm really sorry for your situation and I can't imagine how frustrating and heartbreaking it must be to be reeling from the loss of one daughter and feeling like you're losing your connection to another. But it sounds like your relationship with your first, daughter's mother was one out of circumstance and not a true connection, and it sounds like the woman that you're with now is somebody that you truly chose to be with. I think your daughter tried to put you in a situation to choose between your new wife and her; your comments about her reaction to the birth and subsequent death of her half-sister only reinforced that theory. When you chose to support your new wife over your daughter, for what I will say are very valid reasons, your daughter was made you didn't choose her. That in itself is a pretty messed up game to play and I'm really sorry you had to go through that. \n\nThis is just a really awful situation to be in and I'm so sorry for your loss and for the way that you're being treated by your ex-wife and your daughter.\n\nNTA but OP's daughter and his ex-wife definitely are", "OP has given the context in his comments: OP grew up with parents who neglected him along with his siblings whom he hoped to take in. As soon as he was of legal age, he met his daughter's mother at a party and got pregnant, the mother's family did not want him and they did everything to separate them. her daughter's mother moves to another state and takes her daughter, OP can't follow her because she will take care of her younger siblings, but she still travels to see her daughter, the mother's family, and the mother still they prevent him from having contact with his daughter and are abusive towards him, OP fights in court to be allowed to be with his daughter and gets her to spend the summers with him; in all this OP spends a lot of money; the daughter decides not to go see him anymore when she enters adolescence, clearly the daughter has been alienated by her mother to despise her father; Over the years the daughter treats OP like an ATM blaming him for being a bad father to get the money, at the same time she is extremely rude when referring to every partner that OP has had without even having met any; OP meets his wife, they get married after a few years and have a daughter, the eldest daughter makes it clear that she does not consider OP's wife or her sister as family, three months after the birth the youngest daughter dies, the OP's eldest daughter doesn't contact him or offer comfort to OP but keeps talking rubbish about his wife, daughter gets engaged and plans wedding date on OP's deceased daughter's birth, OP tells her that she might not attend if she wedding is made on that date; OP contributes to the wedding expenses, he was never considered to deliver his daughter at the wedding and his wife was not invited;Additionally, some relatives of his daughter have rejoiced at the death of OP's youngest daughter, OP does not attend the wedding because his wife is devastated because on that date she would have celebrated her deceased daughter's first birthday and wants to support her, the wedding being in another state would have caused OP to be absent for at least two days, which is why he decides not to. go, now his daughter and her mother are harassing him on the phone", "NTA - I hate this obsession with all things wedding!  Not every little girl *dreams* of this day.  If that is/was the peak of your life, I feel sorry for you.  It's a 1 day event, while a marriage is (hopefully) long lived.  For no other reason OP, your daughter will be celebrating her anniversaries on the anniversary of your dead child's birthday.  I sure hope OP's daughter got everything out of this wedding, on this specific day that she hoped for.", "NAH. I was tempted to say YTA, but you buried *a lot* of important details in your comments. Either way, it's sad all around.\n\nI am sorry about your baby's death. It's really sad, no parent should ever have to bury their own child.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSadly, your daughter likely saw herself as being abandoned by you and then felt it a chore to have to 'make up' with a functional stranger years later who was never there when she needed/wanted them. Is that the truth? Apparently you did make plenty of earnest attempts and her mother interfered quite a bit, but either way, those feelings are something your daughter has to live with the rest of her life. That's a lot to go through growing up, and then to see you have *another* child when they're an adult to 'start over with' would likely reopen all of this tender, childhood wounds. Is it right? No. But is it *understandable*? I think it can be.\n\nAs for the wedding date... it's possible it could have been a \"test\": she might have chosen it specifically to see if she was cared enough about that you ***would*** come. But it's also equally possible that, this close to the wedding date, any other potential dates might have completely fallen through and became non-options for a plethora of reasons. There genuinely may have been no \"games\" at play. The day is also special to your daughter because it's also the way she met her partner. Sadly, there is only 365 days a year, so certain days can have many meanings to a group of people. \n\nConsidering you don't mention any messages from your daughter specifically (just her mom..), it's very possible the date aligned better for people she *counted* to be there, and... she simply didn't count on you being there in the first place. You were invited, sure -- but she may have simply just didn't count on you being there, especially since it sounds like you didn't have any wedding party roles (?). \n\nI suspect/worry the damage to your relationship may be irreparable due to the hurt you've both suffered. Hopefully you'll be able to rebuild a relationship, but I will say this, based on some of your comments: be prepared that ANY relationship you have with your daughter or any grandchildren going further **will very likely be with you alone**. Not with your wife. And certainly not any other children you have. I hate to say this bluntly to a grieving parent, but your youngest daughter was never going to be your eldest's \"sister\": They were never going to have a sibling relationship based on your shared history, her trauma, and the decades age gap between both of your daughters. Maybe things will have a better income but it's probably best if you have a cautious mindset from the get-go. \n\nThe only thing I don't quite understand is why your eldest's mother hates you so much, if you were just a guy she had a fling with at a party. To go hours away, costly court battles as a single parent, and to carry seeming malice decades later... it's really... weird? Either she's very vindictive and petty, or there is something very important that has not been disclosed. I get the sense there was a teenage pregnancy, at the very least, but with all ages left out, it doesn't really make it any easier to infer.", "I think your living daughter could have changed date but it's a significant date for her.

Her family is probaly still upset about that.\n\nAlso in your comments you wrote you weren't stable at 18 to move near your daughter, but later on spend lots of money & energy going to court to get your daughter at least in the summers. It sounds like her family tried to enstrange you. In some places that's against the law now and parents can't move children far away from the other parent. Because it sucks what her family did to you and your oldest daughter.\n\nYou wrote your daughter didn't want to stay with you anymore at 18 y. She is getting married at 20y. You've met your wife and married about a year later and again a year later is your youngest deceased daughters birthday. So might your daughter stopped seeing you because you met your wife? Maybe dropped the ball there?\n\nI'm not saying you are the A H  nor your daughter since it sounds like she is coached into it.

Your grieving for god sakes!!!! They could at the very least show you even half the respect they would no doubt demands from you if the rolls were reversed. Shame on them!\n\n\nEta- i read that the date was actually the day they met not the first date anniversary, so my bad on that i need to read better lol. But my stance remains. There's always other anniversaries to pick from. I wouldn't want my wedding anniversary to be my dads saddest day. Hell I'd be sad that day no matter what the age gap, that was her sister as much as she was ops daughter.", "OP does say this day is important to her, so I wonder what is so important that it's bigger than this.", "Im with you on this. OP wasnt pickin - OP is trying to survive the grief.", "The people who are voting Y T A have to be unmarried and childless. Anybody who\u2019s married would realize that the anniversary of your first date really doesn\u2019t compare to the death of a child in choosing a wedding date. \n\n\nAnybody who is a parent would never disparage a father grieving on what would have been his deceased daughter\u2019s first birthday. \n\nSo the people voting against him have to be people who have some crazy, romanticized, misguided view that a wedding is the most important thing in everybody\u2019s life and literally everything, including human decency, should be cast aside for it. It\u2019s honestly depressing.", "So sorry for your loss, OP. I don\u2019t think your TA, but also don\u2019t let this create a rift between you and your daughter if you can avoid it. She will regret in the long run not choosing a date that would allow you to walk her down the aisle, but she is still alive and still you daughter, don\u2019t let grief and anger take it beyond that.", "Yeah it really depends why they were so insistent on that date tbh. But I can't think of a date that's key to a relationship that'd be more important than the day a passed child was born.", "If you've made your mind up, why post here?", "Thats what i want to know, everyone here is jumping to there being a bad guy, forgetting that \u2018NAH\u2019 exists. Op really should of put the info of his relationship with said daughter in the top bit though, as i feel thats very important in deciding if the daughter is an A or not. (\n\nI\u2019m glad to know my assumption was right about her not liking the stepmother, and really not many step relationships work out unfortunately. Whether its the fault of the parent or kid, or even just different personalities that would never get along. \n\nAnd it\u2019s absolutely normal unfortunately for the mother of the daughter to use this to chew out op. They probably had a bad relationship all around, especially if he never got to see his daughter. Though i want to mention this reflects poorly on the ex wife\u2019s character, so if there were any asses here, it would be her", "Most of humanity is inhumane", "This disappoints me because I just recently retained my faith for humanity but it seems it's lost again if they can't put their feet on other people's shoes.", "Okay but if you don't ask if a day is convenient for someone, you can't get upset if they say they can't come because they have something other major on that day.", "Then pick a bloody different venue. This was a powerplay from the daughter and it blew up right in her face. She knew this date is traumatic for her father but decided that her wanting that date was more important. Whether she chose it because it was on her first date anniversary, or her favourite venue only had that date left for the next 3 years doesn\u2019t matter, she chose that date which is a preference over her father\u2019s very real and very *fresh* trauma. I can\u2019t imagine a bigger middle finger from a child. The whole \u2018my wedding is my special perfect day and I don\u2019t need to consider anyone else\u2019s needs but mine\u2019 movement has made people go absolutely feral.", "Apparently that's an important date for the couple? Maybe they met that day? I dunno...", "Bragging? What the fuck is wrong with you. \n\nPosters can comment to give more background and point to things, not agreeing is fine it's not like they are stuck up about it - that when it gets frustrating\n\n\nYou have 0 empathy to this parent who lost a child, i hope the karma you got was worth it. Fucking hell.", "Your comment is dumb. What kind of reaction should OP exhibit, since you're an expert and all? 90% of aita posts aren't \"needed\" and the answer is blindingly obvious, so why does anyone post here?", "Reassurance in the face of a crushing choice. Get over yourself.", "Absolutely, this too", "I doubt the daughter ever wanted a relationship with her half-sister..", "There is some inherent sexism on here. Several posts would definitely get different judgements with genders reversed.", "Now he has the pain of the death of his daughter and the loss of his relationship with his living one. Missing this huge event just compounds and spreads the pain.", "To be fair to the daughter, it doesn't seem like she cares whether OP was or wasn't there much. It's the rest of the family from that side who cares, not her. I feel like there's a lot of missing info about their relationship.", "I agree \ud83d\udcaf. You forgot that men are typically wrong, too!", "I only infrequently visit this sub and honestly I feel like this sub attracts a certain brand of people. Most situations in life are more or less gray, with no clear \"perpetrator\" and \"victim.\" Of course, there are exceptions, for example abuse, then there's a literal perpetrator and a literal victim. But a lot of stuff in life is just...not like that. I feel like this sub attracts people who do want it to be like that or who believe that it is like that, which is why you will see people swinging abuse allegations under posts about a normal disagreement between siblings.", ">When my eldest daughter was planning her wedding, I told her I\u2019m doubtful I\u2019d be there if she chose this date.\n\nRead the post. According to this, the wedding date was not chosen before the birth / death of her sister, and also not locked in when communicated. \n\nALSO:\n\n>Her side of the family has been sending me a lot of scathing messages, particularly her mother.\n\n  \nOPs Ex is not over him.  \n\nOP might have been a raging asshole to his ex and daughter after the divorce, and there might be reasons for the Ex and daughter to be upset with him. But he's still not an asshole for declining to show up to his daughters wedding that was deliberately coinciding with his other deceased daughters birthday. Trying to excuse the bride 'because of scheduling' is really pitiful here.", "What does this have to do with anything?\n\nSo she's only expected to be a decent human if she had met the baby and loved her as a sister?\n\nIt's not hard to have decency and empathy for your father grieving his dead baby, sororal feelings aside.\n\nWTF", "It doesn't, though, because the post said she picked the date after her father told her it was the one date he couldn't do.", "It's still very possible the date was locked in well in advance. Weddings were shut down in 2020 and partly into 2021- their is over a years worth of weddings venues have to get through", "You have to be a professional limbo dancer the way you\u2019re bending over backwards to excuse his older daughter. There\u2019s no damn excuse to knowingly schedule your wedding on the first birthday of your deceased sister. That\u2019s not something reasonable people do. Not at all, NTA.", "it's fine for that date to be significant and important to her too. if she didn't want to change it that's totally fine - but that means she needs to understand that her dad can't make it on that day, because it is devastatingly significant to him. compromise isn't always changing things around - sometimes it's just accepting and understanding that complicated circumstances can mean things can't be ideal. daughter wanted that date, dad was completely unable to attend that date. that's just how it is. NAH (except the family members sending harsh messages to OP).", "Many dads claim the mom kept them away. The truth is, if he fought for custody and was stable/ non problematic 9/10 he would've gotten it."]}
