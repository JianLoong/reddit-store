Neither required 24 hours to do. \n\nI don't know what your relationship with your older daughter is, but my guess is she's always felt on the back burner. She's always felt you've prioritized other things rather than her. And you had the opportunity to perhaps repair some of that damage. \n\nWell you do need to mourn.

But it's also unreasonable of her to expect that you leave your wife alone in her grief.

Maybe MAYBE if she'd been gone a very long time I'd feel a little differently but good lord it's the first year. \n\nI'm sorry I'm just getting madder and madder at your older daughter as I type", ">anniversary of their infant\u2019s death.\n\nNo. It's the anniversary of the daughter's birth. He clearly stated that she died at 3 months of age.", "You have a new family now, congrats on what that means for your relationship with your living daughter.", "it sounds like you realize that in order for you to be there for your wife, you had to be the asshole to your daughter. to me it sounds like a lose/lose situation. there are certainly things that could have been done to mitigate your circumstances, but you didn't want to prioritize them. \n\nit kinda renders your post here moot though bc in reality, you missed your daughter's wedding. the reason feels valid to you and that's fine, it's your life and you get to make your own choices. but that doesn't mean your daughter didn't miss out on having you there for her wedding on top of having the reason for that being family 2.0", "NTA then. She knew the date\u2019s significance to you and I\u2019m sorry, but the day you meet is honestly not that important. It\u2019s not like losing a child. You communicated before they set the date that you might not be able to make it. Don\u2019t feel bad about it. Honestly your daughter put you in a no win situation.", "If they lack a relationship anyway and she knows what the date is, doesn't that also then make her an asshole for becoming upset that her dad (who she doesn't have a close bond with) didn't attend given his reasons?", "Yeah. I mean, in general it doesn't sound like you've been in her life much or made her a priority at any point tbh both by choice and because of situation. She has no reason to care about your wife or her half sibling, her tunnel vision was on bio dad being at her wedding and I don't think that makes her an asshole with the attached baggage. Very much a case of everyone has made their understandable choices and now y'all live with them \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Have you ever considered that's how your daughter feels about your wife and the baby who passed?", "This commenter is a jerk. I\u2019m so, so sorry for your loss. I\u2019m sorry that your daughter can\u2019t be more empathetic to your position.", "Sounds to me like there are other issues for which she\u2019s harboring resentment. Not sure there is a way out of this. I know what it feels like to have a dad put his wife before me (starting at 8 yo) so if that\u2019s how daughter feels that will never go away. I wish you all well & healing.", "Oh no\u2026.this makes it so much worse.", "She has two of her own children and couldn't empathise with you in this situation? I dont even have my own children and wouldn't expect you to come to my wedding. You're certainly NTA.", "I mean, were you supposed to walk her down the aisle?  That\u2019s an incredibly huge moment to miss.  I am so sorry for the loss of your younger daughter.  But it doesn\u2019t sound like your older daughter picked this date for any reason other than it was significant to her and her now husband.  She really shouldn\u2019t have to change that for a stepmom and half sister she has no connection to - however tragic.  \n\nI don\u2019t mean to be callous as the loss of a child is unthinkable.  But in this process, you have 100% shown her that you have chosen your \u201cnew family\u201d over her.  Could you maybe have just gone for the ceremony and then bowed out of the reception and celebration?  You did what you had to do I guess.  But I guess now you have to accept that she might likely not want you in her life anymore.  Soft YTA.", "Fine\u2026 not the day the baby dies\u2026. But to know you should be celebrating that baby\u2019s 1st birthday but not having the baby anymore has got to be a emotional heart wrenching day.", "I was thinking the exact same thing.", "She probably picked out this day and paid for the venue long before the infant sibling was even a concept. Weddings are expensive and take a lot of time and planning. I wouldn\u2019t doubt if this is the case and OP twisted it and made it seem like his daughter was choosing to keep her wedding date to be an AH, but rather than she might\u2019ve been willing to change the date if it wasn\u2019t for losing $$$, possibly the venue, then having to reinvest with something different at a later date.", "You mean He shouldnt hsve been Mourning his daughter on what would have been Hef FIRST birthday? How cold are you?", "My wife didn\u2019t give birth to our daughter on any of those other days.", "Yeah, but in the post and in comments op says he couldn't go on that date if that was the date she chose so in this case we have confirmation that his older daughter did it on purpose.", "Depends how you do it. I proposed to my wife on our one year anniversary and we got married a month later, granted it was in our own home.", "The eldest daughter probably didn't consider OP's deceased daughter as her sister because she didn't like the woman that OP married. OP didn't marry her mother and didn't have a relationship with him growing up once she stopped travelling to visit him during his summer custody time. So the half-sister wasn't really a sister.", "Exactly. This is so callous it\u2019s really making me upset.", "From what I can tell there\u2019s tension, beyond the weddings/death, as OPs wife wasn\u2019t invited. My guess is that the new wife is closer to the daughters age than OPs. \nIts also fairly clear that there\u2019s not that great of a relationship between OP and daughter so ultimately the daughter probably didn\u2019t have extreme feelings about him not attending her wedding.", "She's entitled to her feelings just as he is to his, that's why neither is the AH. Just because someone may have a valid reason for missing something like your wedding doesn't mean it doesn't hurt. And just because you aren't close to your parents doesn't mean you don't want them there for your mile stones.", "She has very much always been a priority.", "Well that was quite a leap\u2026 \n\nReddit in a nutshell I guess\u2026", "I\u2019m well aware that she\u2019s never considered either of them family. She\u2019s made that verbally quite clear.", "There\u2019s definitely resentment on both sides. However, just to clarify, I met my wife when my daughter was already an adult.", "I\u2019m also pretty sure this story has been told with different elements. Anniversary of a death coinciding with a wedding.", "Why did you post here? You clearly feel you are in the right and are arguing with anyone who offers a different perspective. It\u2019s kind of pointless.", "I can understand why you didn\u2019t go. I also hope you are okay with not having a relationship with your living daughter.", "They didn't meet on any other days", "Yeah, but you possibly just lost your living daughter too with this choice, and this is a consequence you\u2019ll have to live and be okay with. Infant loses are horrible, but to put a child you barely knew over your living daughter, and choosing not to be there to support her on her special day is also horrible. You could\u2019ve celebrated your oldest daughters wedding and celebrated the life of your lost child since the date holds two significances\u2026 \n\nHell, a lot of weddings people add in a moment for the people they wished that could attend, but weren\u2019t able to because they left this world too soon. There could\u2019ve been a moment of silence for your infant daughter, even a little memento/memorial, making it a heartfelt moment. \n\nSince you made up your mind and cannot see from the view point of others how damaging this decision is towards your living daughter, what\u2019s even the point of this post. You aren\u2019t TA for mourning, you\u2019re TA for neglecting your living child, and purposely missing out on an amazing and important moment.", "I mean and there's also the fact that the oldest is probably at least twenty years older and likely never even met the baby, if she lives that far away and the baby only lived for 3 months. It's hard to have sisterly feelings about a baby you never knew.", "The missing reason right here. OP is not honest in this post. He never really give a fuck about his oldest daughter. Was not in her life for years. I dont even understand why he's asking if he's the AH. Does the oldest even care if he's at the wedding or not?", "Aha- another case of the missing details", "I\u2019m curious if step mom is close to daughter\u2019s age and that\u2019s why daughter doesn\u2019t like her.", "Yes, you're right there. I suppose she is entitled to her own feelings regarding her dad's attendance at her wedding. I will go back to NAH.", "How?", "It very much doesn\u2019t sound like it.", "How if you hardly been in her life after she was 2?", "From ops replies he has next to no relationship with her and hasn't most of her life due to zero relationship with her mother and distance, and there's active dislike between daughter and wife. Everyone in the situation has made their choices", "But you're still expecting her to treat your loved ones as family when you're not willing to do the same?", "But this one is 3 months before the anniversary so it\u2019s different /s \n\nHonestly if true no day was going to work for him because grief doesn\u2019t stop. The daughter probably knew no matter the day the father wouldn\u2019t be there for her because he probably wasn\u2019t there for her before so why choose a different day", "doesn't sound like that has ever been much of a priority for OP", "We\u2019ve never been close since she had to move with her mother when she was 2. I only saw her a few times a year until her early teens when she no longer wanted to visit during summers. I\u2019d try to visit but it was like pulling teeth for her to make time for me. \n\nAs for the wedding, I would have had to travel alone to the wedding and ultimately be alone with my grief. In no world would my daughter or her family have a moment of silence. I\u2019d have been in a room full of people who don\u2019t like or respect me. There would be no celebrating my deceased daughter. Just me screaming internally. \n\nI understand how I hurt her, but in all honesty, it hurt me that of all the dates, she chose the worst one know exactly how much it would pain me.", "Also, it's very likely that this wedding was planned for years in advance, especially post-COVID. Even with several months' notice, OP's daughter would have had to risk losing out on several thousands of dollars and/or pushing the wedding back another year.", "Even if he was the shittiest most dead beat father this still makes his daughter come across as heartless.\n\n\"Poor suzie, what was your good for nothing dads excuse this time?\"\n\"Ugh, it was just the day that would have been his babies 1st bday if she hadnt died. Of course he chose that instead of my wedding\"\n\"Holy shit suzie, what the hell?\"", "During her childhood I\u2019d scrimp and save and sometimes even starve so I could save enough to go see her a few times a year. I\u2019d have to pay for travel and a hotel room the week or so I was there. For context, when she was 2 I was barely 18, so by no means established. I very much loved her and begged her mother repeatedly not to go. My daughter moving away didn\u2019t feel all too dissimilar to my other daughter passing away.\n\nI spent tens of thousands in court costs too which awarded me summers. I fought very hard for the little time I had.", "Fair enough.\nI didn\u2019t see any of those comments.", "No. She\u2019s never met my wife nor is she willing to. I obviously don\u2019t expect her to treat her like family.", "I honestly have to wonder if the daughter even cares that her father wasn't there. It sounds like he's been an absent parent at best, and he said he's getting flack from her side, but says nothing about whether or not she's even commented.", "I mean, you set the precedent for not treating her loved ones like family.", "That's what I started to think. It doesn't seem like it was that big of a deal. Wife wasn't even invited.", "No. Her family did. I\u2019ve been very much excluded since day one. I had to fight very hard for the time I got with her as a child.\n\nHer mother and I were quite young when she was born, so naturally her grandparents loathed me and made things incredibly difficult. Then her mother moved away with another guy and things just got worse from there.", "Considering how little you saw her for so long, I'm skeptical of that."]}
