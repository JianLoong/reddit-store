It's not ok for her to not know how to do her own hair at 17. It doesn't *have* to be in protective styles. That's all you do because that's what's easiest for you. She needs to learn styles and maintenance she can do on her own. Not sure what you've tried but youtube tutorials are definitely an option. If all else fails, she may need shorter hair.\n\nBigger than that, her not having her hair done is not a proper punishment; that's a basic need. Her hair is *directly* related to the way she's treated by others. Having undone hair can literally leave her open for more discrimination. Not to mention if her hair is difficult to manage, that may well be the reason she didn't wash it. She may struggle with that as well", "NTA. This isn\u2019t even a punishment, it\u2019s more of a privilege she lost out on because she lacks organization in time management.", "NTA. Your daughter needs to learn how to take care of her own hair or go to an experienced stylist who can cut it into a more manageable style.  My kid (11M) has extremely thick and long hair.  While it's not curly, it's difficult to manage because it is so thick and tangles in the back into huge rats' nests very easily. There's literally enough hair there that if you shaved his head you'd have enough hair for 2-3 wigs.  I get it thinned twice a year and it's still a lot of hair.  I've told him that unless he's willing to learn to take care of it and manage it properly he's getting it cut short.", "NTA", "NTA.

She might be making you braid her hair because you are forbidding her from straightening her hair. Let her straighten it if she wants to. She can cut her hair if it gets too damaged.", "NTA i think i understand this situation pretty thoroughly. i didn\u2019t start taking care of my hair without my mom\u2019s help until i was your daughter\u2019s age, literally right before i left for college. my mom would never put it this way, but in hindsight i must\u2019ve been to deal with \u2014 i was always getting angry at her for \u2018pulling to hard\u2019 or \u2018not doing it right\u2019 or \u2018taking too long\u2019. maybe you can relate to that?\n\non the other hand, from your perspective it may feel like you\u2019ve been giving her opportunities to take care of this herself, but you need to fully commit for it to count. she will probably protest which is likely why you haven\u2019t committed in the past, but trust me, she will get over it. \n\ni recommend you not touch her hair any more. maybe you can get the shampoo, conditioner, and hair ties etc for her as needed, but let her figure out the maintenance aspect by herself. it might be hard to see her struggle, but she needs to in order to be an adult.", "NTA, I was expecting her to be 6 or something. She's 17! She can do her own hair.", "NTA. You didn't punish her by not doing her hair. You didn't have time to do it. And even then, you managed to do part of it (I personally would have told her to go whistle). She's 17, she's going to have to learn that she can't expect you to drop everything for her. The world does not cater to her.", "NTA\n\nI'd use this as the starting point of \"I will not do your hair after you turn 18\".\n\nSit her down, explain how it is not a punishment, that enough is enough.

You doing your hair at 10 is different than being able to do full protective styles on your own head.", "The only thing she can do to her is straightening it, and she did a lot once she learned how to, but I had to stop her because her hair was getting damaged. As to hair styles, I've tried teaching both her and my eldest daughter, who's 20 now, and both always end up tangling their hair, and it turning into a mess.
