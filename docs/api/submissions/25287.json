But yeah, if it were the mortgage, I'd still give zero fucks.

Usually these contracts grant her protections from eviction and they ensure you to fix things in a timely manner. Now, it varies location to location and the rules are different when you live with your landlord. If you can prove that you are offering her at least the same legal protections a renter would have then you are NTA for your deal proposal (because if you aren't going to offer her those protections it sounds like the deal you are making is \"i'll let you give up your rights to guaranteed housing for a discount on rent\" which I think is super shady.

We were at an impasse and there didn't seem to be any solution other than breaking up or continuing to live separately. We found a compromise\n\nWe agreed to take her \"rent\" payments and put it in a separate account that neither of us could touch. We also agreed that the account would constitute her \"escape fund\" in the event I turned out to be the wrong sort of guy (she had serious anxiety problems compounded by her first marriage). After 10 years of marriage we would use the account on a vacation. We chose Disney's Animal Kingdom :)", "NTA \n\nIF you write up a formal rental agreement / lease.

If you want to be kind, write up a lease and then I think this would be more than fair.\n\nShe may not be building equity with you, but as you said, it's no different than if she were renting elsewhere. That being said, if you get married, do you expect her to *still* not build equity? Does she get equity from the years of rent? You need to think about this and discuss this with her.", "What does she think her landlord does with her rent payment? He pays the mortgage!

When you commit to someone, you make a conscious decision to share each others burdens. That includes signing on to help with a mortgage. If she weren\u2019t with you, she\u2019d be paying a lot more than $600 elsewhere for rent, so paying $600 a month should be seen as a blessing for her. \n\nI think the two of you should sit down and lay out some groundwork for your relationship. Discuss where you want the relationship to end up. If it\u2019s a forever thing, then she should have no problem with combining incomes and financially contributing to your life together. If not, then the two of you may need to explore the prospect of going separate ways. \n\nHer paying $600 a month for your mortgage is no different than paying rent, but she gets the bonus of having the most relaxed and forgiving landlord possible, you.", "Looks like she is playing you, of course she should pay her share .", "NTA\n\nShe wants to live rent-free.

You should technically charge her a market rate; however I\u2019d maybe discuss a discounted rate and have in writing terms like responsible for damages, how much notice she gets to move out, etc. if you break up you need to have an agreed upon exit.", "NTA - if she doesn't contribute at all then she's effectively living with you for free and that's a Mickey take.\n\nIf anyone was to be concerned, I would have expected it to be you and the implications of whether she would have some rights to your house if she has directly contributed to your mortgage.\n\nWould she be more comfortable if you called it charging her rent? That was kinda the solution me and my now husband came up with way back when I first moved in with him.", "I don\u2019t get the stories the person moving in was paying rent and if they weren\u2019t, they were living with their parents, but most likely we\u2019re paying rent someplace else. It doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s contributing to their partners mortgage or their landlords mortgage. Someone is always paying someone\u2019s mortgage.  People like this are so freaking entitled dump her and be done with it.", "NTA. She has to pay to live somewhere. She can either pay you a heavily reduced rate, she can rent her own place, or she can buy her own place. There is no argument for living with you for free. She does know she was paying the mortgage of most landlords she\u2019s had in the past right? What\u2019s the difference? She deserves free rent because she has a personal relationship with you? Honestly she should be happy she can get such a great deal rather than paying exorbitant rent prices elsewhere", "NTA. She simply just can\u2019t live rent free. If she doesn\u2019t understand this, then I would seriously reconsider the arrangement.", "If she wants to build equity, tell her to buy a Condo and rent it out with the rent mostly covering mortgage and fees etc. This way she is increasing her net worth and she can pay some rent where she is living.

My partner pays the mortgage and I pay everything else....my name is also on the property and no we aren't married.", "Nta, as long as you do a sign rental agreement. That way she protects if things go south. You wouldn\u2019t be able to kick her out.", "NTA. Like you said, it is what she would be doing renting elsewhere. Keep your property separate until marriage. If she wants to own property, she can buy her own.", "Contributing financially is fair. I imagine you incur $600/mo of expenses that aren't \"the mortgage,\" so she can pay towards those. I think the \"significant difference\" between your salaries should come into play", "NTA based on the numbers quoted- but if you make a lot more than her and if your interest portion of your mort is relatively low- then you could be pushing it.... She gets no tax advantages out of this as well, so it can actually get pretty thorny.  Id ask her what she thinks is fair and why, if you guys end up together long term you'll be very financially intertwined anyway.", "I wouldn\u2019t expect to live with a partner for free unless they were incredibly wealthy. $600 is a very reasonable amount to contribute. \n\nIf that\u2019s too high for her current salary maybe not, but if she also has a decent income this is very reasonable.", "NAH.\n\nI see both sides on this. She is saving by not renting, *however*, giving her the responsibility to contributing towards paying down your principal on your mortgage without any of the attendant rights is not fair. She should either be a renter with all of the rights that entails or on your mortgage and title, with those rights too, or you're just asking her to either shoot herself in the face or open yourself up to a big lawsuit.\n\nI think having her pay expenses that are not part of the mortgage (food, utilities, etc) is a fair compromise. Otherwise, if you want her to contribute a decent portion of her income towards building equity for you, you're either asking her to throw her money into a pit and light it on fire or, alternatively, begging her not to impose a constructive trust on some portion of the title if you break up.\n\nIf you don't want her on the title or to open up the possibility that she could later sue you and impose a constructive trust on your own house for all of the increased equity value she contributed towards it, I would definitely not ask her to pay any of the mortgage.", "NTA.\n\nHell, $600 a month is less than half of just the interest on your mortgage, let alone property taxes, maintenance, etc. You are still financially supporting her more than she would be supporting you.", "NTA. But are you willing to breakup with gf if you still remain at an impasse for a long time?", "NTA and DTMFA. She showed you who she is. Believe her. There are plenty of people who would be grateful for your generosity here. Find one of them.", "Definitely not the ass hole. I would kill to be paying 600 for rent.", "NTA, but it\u2019s a \ud83d\udea9imo. I wouldn\u2019t move in together just yet.", "She\u2019ll live there for two years then sue you for half the house", "ESH. \n\nOffer her all the benefits/protections of a rental, or to not move in with you. Keep things clearly defined one way or another.", "This is stupid.  She is contributing to wear and tear on the house.  You are being more than generous..", "Tell her to buy a house and then you\u2019ll move in rent free. See what her response is", "Will the chores be split? Usually, what happens is a woman moves in. She pays her \"rent,\" which goes to pay off a potion of his \"asset\" and she does all the cleaning and cooking etc. Then he dumps her when bored and moves on to the next woman, stating, \"Hey, I was just your landlord.\"", "I went through this with an ex. He owned the house and had a daughter who lived there and he wanted me to pay for half of everything when I moved in. Essentially, yes I was saving money by moving in but it wasn\u2019t my responsibility to pay his mortgage without the benefits or pay for his daughters living expenses.\n\nWe ended up settling on my paying for 1/3 of the bills in the house minus his mortgage. And I covered 100% of groceries. \n\nThis was also a guy who took every opportunity to abuse me over the next year. Locking me in the house and taking my phone to trying to lock me out just because I didn\u2019t agree with him on a topic. Looking back I should of drawn up a rental agreement, LOL. \n\n\nSo, if you care about your partner I think you should make her feel as comfortable as possible.  IF that\u2019s a rental agreement where she has the same rights and protections as a renter then do that. But if not her being in the house doesn\u2019t affect much. You are responsible for the mortgage regardless of her being there or not. Talk about her paying some of the bills and see what she says.", "NTA\n\nGF will have $600 more a month but she wants $1200 more.\n\nThis is a test and each of you thinks the other one is failing it.\n\nHer) You aren't *really* committed to the relationship because you want her to pay something to live in your home.\n\nOP) She wants to be a freeloader and not contribute even a fraction of what it costs to have a place to live.\n\nI think you two aren't ready for this step.", "NAH. Both sides are understandable. \n\nI would be uneasy both paying my boyfriend\u2019s mortgage AND living without paying my own way. Perhaps there is a way to make this more palatable for her, like having her take on the lion\u2019s share of the utilities, or contribute a reasonable amount to a longterm savings amount that you either share later in life together, or she gets to keep if you split. \n\nBut, don\u2019t make the mistake of comparing her situation to that of a renter, unless you want to be her landlord.", "It sounds like she wants you to take care of her. Does she ever pay for activities or good when going out? As you stated that this is 1/2 of what she pays now. Take the moving in off the table and talk about it in a year if your still together.", "I see posts like these every so often and the replies never fail to make me cringe. The idea that because your GF is paying rent somewhere else, she might as well just give that money to you is not a good reason to charge her rent. It's also not reasonable to think she has to pay you just because you resent her for living \"rent free.\" You need to decide if you want a tenant or a partner.\n\n**If you want a tenant,** you need to draw up a defined rental agreement guaranteeing her all the rights of a renter. This means you cannot evict her, and that you are responsible for all household repairs. If the hot water heater breaks, it's on YOU to replace this out of your pocket, not hers. It also needs to be done in a timely manner. You cannot leave your tenant high and dry without a working fridge, or hot water, or a washing machine, etc.\n\nBear in mind most people don't live with their landlords and sleep in their beds and share housework. A typical rental agreement is not going to delineate how household chores are shared between both of you, nor how household chores should be viewed in regards to rent. i.e., if your partner does all the cooking and cleaning, she's contributing to the household in a way that she may feel should be reflected in the price of rent. She's technically providing you a service by doing these things, so you need to take this into consideration as well. This works both ways.\n\nKnow that bringing all of these little things into the discussion of rent is not always easy for couples to do. It can create a lot of tension and animosity between people depending on how each of you feel about all of those elements.\n\n**If you want a partner,** you need to realize it's not fair to make her pay the mortgage on a piece of property YOU own. Remember that mortgage is not what it costs to occupy a space, it's what it costs to OWN that property.\n\nOver the course of years, she could pay thousands of dollars into this property, and it's only ever going to belong to you. This is incredibly unfair to her, and if you genuinely care about her, you wouldn't just charge her \"rent\" and use that money for your own financial gain.\n\nIf you are insistent on making her pay the mortgage, you need to give her a stake equal to her contribution.\n\nIf you don't want to do that, then you could have her take on a bigger responsibility for other household expenses. Think groceries, cable bill, internet, water, lights, etc. That way she is not living with you for \"free.\" She'll be contributing financially to what it costs to \"live\" in this space, but she's not paying the mortgage which is what it costs to \"own\" the property.", "NTA. It\u2019s called paying rent. She doesn\u2019t get to free load off of you because you\u2019re the owner and not some random stranger landlord.", "NTA ... She's splitting hairs; you offered her a good deal.", "Your urilities only cost $125/month? What about internet? Garbage pickup? Streaming services? Groceries? These are things she should be contributing to. If you use thr argument of \"every renter contributes to someone else's mortgage\" you need to draw up a rental agreement with her. Mild YTA for not considering all options and suggesting she's just like any other renter. She should definitely contribute, but it doesn't need to be to your mortgage.", "There's a financial part to this and a relational part to this.  Honestly, it sounds like you aren't aligned with your finances, so it's too soon to move in together. It's only been a year. She has no right to expect you to be the only one paying the mortgage. That's absurd. \n\nIf you two shared the same financial vision & goals for living together, that would be one thing. But seeing as you feel uneasy with her living rent free (and I would be too), I think you two should continue dating, but hold off on moving in together until you can divide the responsibilities more equitably.", "INFO: Are you going to give her equity equal to the amount of money she contributes to the mortgage? You said there is a significant difference in your income. What are your incomes (ballpark, doesn't have to be exact)?", "Everyone is different. When my wife moved into my apartment at the time, I just continued paying everything. It never even occurred to me to ask her to contribute anything at all.", "I swear the GF posted about this like 2 weeks ago. NTA", "NTA. No contribution beyond the utilities, no moving in. Shared expenses (bills and rent/mortgages) should be contributed toward in proportion. So if you make 50 and she makes 30, you pay 5/8 and she pays 3/8.

If she pays towards the mortgage though I agree she deserves that equity back if you split up though.", "No. She lives there she pays too. Feminism has its downfalls.", "INFO: that depends, are you planning on adding her name to the mortgage? Otherwise she could pay thousands for years and if you break up she\u2019s get nothing despite paying the mortgage all that time.\n\nYou say it\u2019s the same for renters, but it isn\u2019t. Renters have a contract, I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s not the case here?\n\nIt\u2019s your mortgage, presumably you can afford it on your own. If you want your GF to be a lodger/tenant then you need to draw up a formal contract, otherwise you need to add her to the mortgage, or forgot her paying the mortgage and just have her pay her share of bills and groceries instead. It\u2019s unreasonable to expect her to take on this risk without anything formal in place.", "Noooo having a landlord is not the same as paying rent to your partner. She shouldn't pay you rent ro sleep in the same bed with you.

Genuinely asking because I have paid rent as an adult.", "YTA. She\u2019s not a renter. She has no stake in your mortgage. Instead ask her to contribute to food budget or something else.", "NAH/YTA sort of?  \nCompletely understand where both of you are coming from. Maybe suggest that if she helps pay off the mortgage then you can add her name to the property deed once it's paid off. (Or something to that effect, property law might work differently where you live) You two should be a team if you're serious enough to move in with each other, it's not like she's being forced to pay off a property that she won't own and there are no other alternatives.", "YTA. That is your asset, and you are able to cover that cost on your own. She should be contributing to everything else (utilities, groceries, vacation costs etc). Because it is your asset, and if you want her to contribute to said asset, make a lease, and if you split, she gets those funds back.", "YTA, unless you are also planning to grant her some interest in the equity you will be amassing as a result of the payment.   \n\n\nIt's different from a landlord tenant situation, because while yes it's lower cost, she's not getting any of the benefits ie protections of renting from a landlord.

Instead, she has the insecurity and can be kicked out if you break up or get mad at her.", "YTA - u want her to pay for ur property without earning a share in it.", "YTA.\n\nShe isn't asking to live with you for free.

Is she going to be paying, or contributing *at all* to paying, for any kind of improvements, like paint/wallpaper, updates to the house (*e.g.,* new plumbing or lighting fixtures, new flooring, etc.), buying plants for the yard, and so on? Because tenants don't do that, whereas live-in partners often do \u2013 and then when they break up, the one whose name isn't on the deed is out thousands of dollars spent improving and decorating a house they don't own, while the one who owns the house continues to benefit from those improvements financed by the non-owning partner. \n\nIf she's going to have all the drawbacks of homeownership without any of the benefits, then she's in the right. If you want her to pay rent, then she needs to have a lease and all the protections that come with it (including the right not to be thrown out at a moment's notice if the two of you break up).

If you want the financial stress of your mortgage to be minimized you should get a roommate with their own room and a lease.", "Please provide an update on how this turns out.  Good luck!", "Mate, tell her now there's gonna be a prenup.  You're walking into this relationship with a house, which -- assuming you bought more than 18 months ago -- is on a mortgage with an interest rate probably half (or less!) of anything you can get now.  Who knows if or when we'll see mortgage rates like that again.\n\nYou need to look out for yourself and make sure that if this relationship goes sideways, she ain't walking away with your house or forcing a sale.\n\nAdd that to thinking she deserves housing for $125 a month (!!!) and Kanye has a relevant song.  Anyone decent would be jumping at a nice $600/mo housing unit, and taking the $600/month she's saving from her $1200 budget, putting that in vanguard, and collecting $7200/year.\n\nTell her there will be a prenup w/ a separation of assets because the house is yours and it's going to stay yours.  I'd bet her reaction will be enlightening.", "> Wait I\u2019m sorry, what exactly is the advantage of not being listed on a mortgage?\n\nMortgage is the debt.  Deed is ownership.  The advantage of not being on a mortgage, but being on the deed, is you own the house but don't owe the mortgage.  \n\nBut, in most cases that's not allowed by the lender, for obvious reasons.  You have to be either only on the mortgage (which is bad) or on both the mortgage and on the deed.", "Honestly, who cares? I find this attitude really weird. I'm able to pay the mortgage on my house. If my current partner wanted to move into my place, I'd welcome them and be thrilled, I wouldn't ask for them to pay for it. I'm already paying the damn thing, it's not like I have to pay it more if they come. If they wanted to kick in for utilities that would be nice as that is the one expense that does go up. But honestly it's only money - can't compare to having someone to love.   \n\n\nI've had a lot of friends die and I can absolutely say that not a single one of them asked after their fucking bank account when they went.", "OP hasn't answered a single question asking about the difference in their incomes. I suspect it's actually pretty huge - enough that it would make a big difference in people's answers.", "It's absolutely too transactional for a romantic relationship. Personally, I'd break up with the OP over it if I were in the GF's position. I'd rather keep paying the 1200$ a month and find a new romantic partner who didn't want me to be a literal tenant to him.", "$1200 for rent, plus whatever she paid for utilities plus renters insurance plus cable plus trash removal plus internet. Way more than $1200", "I don't think what the OP is doing is wrong (at least for now) but I will agree it is a temporary arrangement at best. I think it will have to change if they ever get engaged. \n\nIs it fair for OP to pay the entire mortgage if they are living together though? Particularly when his girlfriend does work. \n\nI think the only other way this works is if his gf pays 100% of the utilities otherwise I can't find a better solution unless OP wants to eat 100% of the house costs. \n\nIf it were me, I'd really have to know how much my girlfriend was making herself before I make a decision on if I ask her to contribute. I'm a little old school when it comes to this and if I'm in a cheaper area, I could probably afford to cover everything myself. I wouldn't mind if it didn't cripple me financially to do it and the girlfriend at least took care of the house (chores, groceries, cooking, etc.). \n\nIt's just kind of in that awkward stage of the relationship imo where they're not engaged but they want to live together. Especially with the fact that one of them owns property and the other doesn't. So, they now have to figure out how to divide house duties and house bills.", "She\u2019s not a rocket scientist.. obviously", "She\u2019s hoping to get a free ride and maybe thinks she will get one once they\u2019re married too", "It's the same thing if she moves into ops house, it would be considered a month to month leash without the paperwork, he would legally have to evict her if he wanted her out.", "Exactly, and honestly it completely ignores the fact that this person moving in literally makes all of his expenses less and will be doing at least half the chores too\u2026this is not the same thing as renting out a room to a friend even. If this is someone you plan to be with long term you shouldn\u2019t want them to end up in a worse financial position should your relationship end up not working out. If it were me I\u2019d ask them to put this money aside each month for a down payment should that ever happen or if we end up committing long term to use for another property. This way we both benefit from this money at best and at worst I have not left the relationship having extracted profit that\u2019s just kind of gross to me", "I don't, not in NYC where everything's crazy. If she makes 30K and he makes 200K for example? He said the difference is significant and then never answered anyone asking how much, which makes me think it's pretty high.", "She is paying for where she lives. You\u2019re kind of an idiot, man. If you can\u2019t afford her just say that.", "And what if she broke up with him and wants to move out? Would she have to pay the remaining months rent? You are making this way too complicated", "She\u2019s not getting a lease now she should move out asap from there also\u2026.", "> we ~are~ WERE talking about getting married\n\nFTFY   You've been together for a year and now realize that you are not on the same page financially; something that is crucial for a successful long-term relationship.   Many would say that's far too soon to be talking marriage and most would say that this issue is a sign that the two of you definitely need more time.   You were already uncomfortable with picking up the tab all the time on outings, telling yourself that it was justified by the income disparity.   Now she is refusing to pay to house herself.  \n\nShe has no savings, she lives to the limit (or beyond) her means.   You don't want to live like that so what's with the marriage talk?", ">then you should be willing to take her \"barefoot and in her shift\"\n\nafter a year of dating?   It's one thing to have a solid relationship that is tried by events out of ones control, it's totally different to start out with such a deficit in contribution.", "Don\u2019t worry he was probs a POG"]}
