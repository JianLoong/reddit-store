Usually these contracts grant her protections from eviction and they ensure you to fix things in a timely manner. Now, it varies location to location and the rules are different when you live with your landlord. If you can prove that you are offering her at least the same legal protections a renter would have then you are NTA for your deal proposal (because if you aren't going to offer her those protections it sounds like the deal you are making is \"i'll let you give up your rights to guaranteed housing for a discount on rent\" which I think is super shady.

We were at an impasse and there didn't seem to be any solution other than breaking up or continuing to live separately. We found a compromise\n\nWe agreed to take her \"rent\" payments and put it in a separate account that neither of us could touch. We also agreed that the account would constitute her \"escape fund\" in the event I turned out to be the wrong sort of guy (she had serious anxiety problems compounded by her first marriage). After 10 years of marriage we would use the account on a vacation. We chose Disney's Animal Kingdom :)", "NTA \n\nIF you write up a formal rental agreement / lease.

If you want to be kind, write up a lease and then I think this would be more than fair.\n\nShe may not be building equity with you, but as you said, it's no different than if she were renting elsewhere. That being said, if you get married, do you expect her to *still* not build equity? Does she get equity from the years of rent? You need to think about this and discuss this with her.", "What does she think her landlord does with her rent payment? He pays the mortgage!

When you commit to someone, you make a conscious decision to share each others burdens. That includes signing on to help with a mortgage. If she weren\u2019t with you, she\u2019d be paying a lot more than $600 elsewhere for rent, so paying $600 a month should be seen as a blessing for her. \n\nI think the two of you should sit down and lay out some groundwork for your relationship. Discuss where you want the relationship to end up. If it\u2019s a forever thing, then she should have no problem with combining incomes and financially contributing to your life together. If not, then the two of you may need to explore the prospect of going separate ways. \n\nHer paying $600 a month for your mortgage is no different than paying rent, but she gets the bonus of having the most relaxed and forgiving landlord possible, you.", "Looks like she is playing you, of course she should pay her share .", "NTA\n\nShe wants to live rent-free.

You should technically charge her a market rate; however I\u2019d maybe discuss a discounted rate and have in writing terms like responsible for damages, how much notice she gets to move out, etc. if you break up you need to have an agreed upon exit.", "NTA - if she doesn't contribute at all then she's effectively living with you for free and that's a Mickey take.\n\nIf anyone was to be concerned, I would have expected it to be you and the implications of whether she would have some rights to your house if she has directly contributed to your mortgage.\n\nWould she be more comfortable if you called it charging her rent? That was kinda the solution me and my now husband came up with way back when I first moved in with him.", "I don\u2019t get the stories the person moving in was paying rent and if they weren\u2019t, they were living with their parents, but most likely we\u2019re paying rent someplace else. It doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s contributing to their partners mortgage or their landlords mortgage. Someone is always paying someone\u2019s mortgage.  People like this are so freaking entitled dump her and be done with it.", "NTA. She has to pay to live somewhere. She can either pay you a heavily reduced rate, she can rent her own place, or she can buy her own place. There is no argument for living with you for free. She does know she was paying the mortgage of most landlords she\u2019s had in the past right? What\u2019s the difference? She deserves free rent because she has a personal relationship with you? Honestly she should be happy she can get such a great deal rather than paying exorbitant rent prices elsewhere", "NTA. She simply just can\u2019t live rent free. If she doesn\u2019t understand this, then I would seriously reconsider the arrangement.", "If she wants to build equity, tell her to buy a Condo and rent it out with the rent mostly covering mortgage and fees etc. This way she is increasing her net worth and she can pay some rent where she is living.

My partner pays the mortgage and I pay everything else....my name is also on the property and no we aren't married.", "Nta, as long as you do a sign rental agreement. That way she protects if things go south. You wouldn\u2019t be able to kick her out.", "NTA. Like you said, it is what she would be doing renting elsewhere. Keep your property separate until marriage. If she wants to own property, she can buy her own.", "Contributing financially is fair. I imagine you incur $600/mo of expenses that aren't \"the mortgage,\" so she can pay towards those. I think the \"significant difference\" between your salaries should come into play", "NTA based on the numbers quoted- but if you make a lot more than her and if your interest portion of your mort is relatively low- then you could be pushing it.... She gets no tax advantages out of this as well, so it can actually get pretty thorny.  Id ask her what she thinks is fair and why, if you guys end up together long term you'll be very financially intertwined anyway.", "I wouldn\u2019t expect to live with a partner for free unless they were incredibly wealthy. $600 is a very reasonable amount to contribute. \n\nIf that\u2019s too high for her current salary maybe not, but if she also has a decent income this is very reasonable.", "NAH.\n\nI see both sides on this. She is saving by not renting, *however*, giving her the responsibility to contributing towards paying down your principal on your mortgage without any of the attendant rights is not fair. She should either be a renter with all of the rights that entails or on your mortgage and title, with those rights too, or you're just asking her to either shoot herself in the face or open yourself up to a big lawsuit.\n\nI think having her pay expenses that are not part of the mortgage (food, utilities, etc) is a fair compromise. Otherwise, if you want her to contribute a decent portion of her income towards building equity for you, you're either asking her to throw her money into a pit and light it on fire or, alternatively, begging her not to impose a constructive trust on some portion of the title if you break up.\n\nIf you don't want her on the title or to open up the possibility that she could later sue you and impose a constructive trust on your own house for all of the increased equity value she contributed towards it, I would definitely not ask her to pay any of the mortgage.", "NTA.\n\nHell, $600 a month is less than half of just the interest on your mortgage, let alone property taxes, maintenance, etc. You are still financially supporting her more than she would be supporting you.", "NTA. But are you willing to breakup with gf if you still remain at an impasse for a long time?", "NTA and DTMFA. She showed you who she is. Believe her. There are plenty of people who would be grateful for your generosity here. Find one of them.", "Definitely not the ass hole. I would kill to be paying 600 for rent.", "NTA, but it\u2019s a \ud83d\udea9imo. I wouldn\u2019t move in together just yet.", "She\u2019ll live there for two years then sue you for half the house", "ESH. \n\nOffer her all the benefits/protections of a rental, or to not move in with you. Keep things clearly defined one way or another.", "This is stupid.  She is contributing to wear and tear on the house.  You are being more than generous..", "Tell her to buy a house and then you\u2019ll move in rent free. See what her response is", "Will the chores be split? Usually, what happens is a woman moves in. She pays her \"rent,\" which goes to pay off a potion of his \"asset\" and she does all the cleaning and cooking etc. Then he dumps her when bored and moves on to the next woman, stating, \"Hey, I was just your landlord.\"", "I went through this with an ex. He owned the house and had a daughter who lived there and he wanted me to pay for half of everything when I moved in. Essentially, yes I was saving money by moving in but it wasn\u2019t my responsibility to pay his mortgage without the benefits or pay for his daughters living expenses.\n\nWe ended up settling on my paying for 1/3 of the bills in the house minus his mortgage. And I covered 100% of groceries. \n\nThis was also a guy who took every opportunity to abuse me over the next year. Locking me in the house and taking my phone to trying to lock me out just because I didn\u2019t agree with him on a topic. Looking back I should of drawn up a rental agreement, LOL. \n\n\nSo, if you care about your partner I think you should make her feel as comfortable as possible.  IF that\u2019s a rental agreement where she has the same rights and protections as a renter then do that. But if not her being in the house doesn\u2019t affect much. You are responsible for the mortgage regardless of her being there or not. Talk about her paying some of the bills and see what she says.", "NTA\n\nGF will have $600 more a month but she wants $1200 more.\n\nThis is a test and each of you thinks the other one is failing it.\n\nHer) You aren't *really* committed to the relationship because you want her to pay something to live in your home.\n\nOP) She wants to be a freeloader and not contribute even a fraction of what it costs to have a place to live.\n\nI think you two aren't ready for this step.", "NAH. Both sides are understandable. \n\nI would be uneasy both paying my boyfriend\u2019s mortgage AND living without paying my own way. Perhaps there is a way to make this more palatable for her, like having her take on the lion\u2019s share of the utilities, or contribute a reasonable amount to a longterm savings amount that you either share later in life together, or she gets to keep if you split. \n\nBut, don\u2019t make the mistake of comparing her situation to that of a renter, unless you want to be her landlord.", "It sounds like she wants you to take care of her. Does she ever pay for activities or good when going out? As you stated that this is 1/2 of what she pays now. Take the moving in off the table and talk about it in a year if your still together.", "I see posts like these every so often and the replies never fail to make me cringe. The idea that because your GF is paying rent somewhere else, she might as well just give that money to you is not a good reason to charge her rent. It's also not reasonable to think she has to pay you just because you resent her for living \"rent free.\" You need to decide if you want a tenant or a partner.\n\n**If you want a tenant,** you need to draw up a defined rental agreement guaranteeing her all the rights of a renter. This means you cannot evict her, and that you are responsible for all household repairs. If the hot water heater breaks, it's on YOU to replace this out of your pocket, not hers. It also needs to be done in a timely manner. You cannot leave your tenant high and dry without a working fridge, or hot water, or a washing machine, etc. \n\nBear in mind most people don't live with their landlords and sleep in their beds and share housework. A typical rental agreement is not going to delineate how household chores are shared between both of you, nor how household chores should be viewed in regards to rent. i.e., if your partner does all the cooking and cleaning, she's contributing to the household in a way that she may feel should be reflected in the price of rent. She's technically providing you a service by doing these things, so you need to take this into consideration as well. This works both ways.\n\nKnow that bringing all of these little things into the discussion of rent is not always each for couples to do. It can create a lot of tension and animosity between people depending on how each of you feel about all of those elements. \n\n**If you want a partner,** you need to realize it's not fair to make her pay the mortgage on a piece of property YOU own. Remember that mortgage is not what it costs to occupy a space, it's what it costs to OWN that property. \n\nOver the course of years, she could pay thousands of dollars into this property, and it's only ever going to belong to you. This is incredibly unfair to her, and if you genuinely care about her, you wouldn't just charge her \"rent\" and use that money for your own financial gain.\n\nIf you are insistent on making her pay the mortgage, you need to give her a stake equal to her contribution.\n\nIf you don't want to do that, then you could have her take on a bigger responsibility for other household expenses. Think groceries, cable bill, internet, water, lights, etc. That way she is not living with you for \"free.\" She'll be contributing financially to what it costs to \"live\" in this space, but she's not paying the mortgage which is what it costs to \"own\" the property.", "NTA. It\u2019s called paying rent. She doesn\u2019t get to free load off of you because you\u2019re the owner and not some random stranger landlord.", "NTA ... She's splitting hairs; you offered her a good deal.", "Your urilities only cost $125/month? What about internet? Garbage pickup? Streaming services? Groceries? These are things she should be contributing to. If you use thr argument of \"every renter contributes to someone else's mortgage\" you need to draw up a rental agreement with her. Mild YTA for not considering all options and suggesting she's just like any other renter. She should definitely contribute, but it doesn't need to be to your mortgage.", "There's a financial part to this and a relational part to this.  Honestly, it sounds like you aren't aligned with your finances, so it's too soon to move in together. It's only been a year. She has no right to expect you to be the only one paying the mortgage. That's absurd. \n\nIf you two shared the same financial vision & goals for living together, that would be one thing. But seeing as you feel uneasy with her living rent free (and I would be too), I think you two should continue dating, but hold off on moving in together until you can divide the responsibilities more equitably.", "INFO: Are you going to give her equity equal to the amount of money she contributes to the mortgage? You said there is a significant difference in your income. What are your incomes (ballpark, doesn't have to be exact)?", "Everyone is different. When my wife moved into my apartment at the time, I just continued paying everything. It never even occurred to me to ask her to contribute anything at all.", "I swear the GF posted about this like 2 weeks ago. NTA", "NTA. No contribution beyond the utilities, no moving in. Shared expenses (bills and rent/mortgages) should be contributed toward in proportion. So if you make 50 and she makes 30, you pay 5/8 and she pays 3/8.

If she pays towards the mortgage though I agree she deserves that equity back if you split up though.", "No. She lives there she pays too. Feminism has its downfalls.", "INFO: that depends, are you planning on adding her name to the mortgage? Otherwise she could pay thousands for years and if you break up she\u2019s get nothing despite paying the mortgage all that time.\n\nYou say it\u2019s the same for renters, but it isn\u2019t. Renters have a contract, I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s not the case here?\n\nIt\u2019s your mortgage, presumably you can afford it on your own. If you want your GF to be a lodger/tenant then you need to draw up a formal contract, otherwise you need to add her to the mortgage, or forgot her paying the mortgage and just have her pay her share of bills and groceries instead. It\u2019s unreasonable to expect her to take on this risk without anything formal in place.", "Noooo having a landlord is not the same as paying rent to your partner. She shouldn't pay you rent ro sleep in the same bed with you. YTA", "NAH, can you come up with an agreement that she will get back half of the $600 she pays per month should you two break up and she has to move out?\n\nAlso, she could still contribute another $300 per month for utilities and groceries?\n\nDoes that seem fair? Genuinely asking because I have paid rent as an adult.", "YTA. She\u2019s not a renter. She has no stake in your mortgage. Instead ask her to contribute to food budget or something else.", "NAH/YTA sort of?  \nCompletely understand where both of you are coming from. Maybe suggest that if she helps pay off the mortgage then you can add her name to the property deed once it's paid off. (Or something to that effect, property law might work differently where you live) You two should be a team if you're serious enough to move in with each other, it's not like she's being forced to pay off a property that she won't own and there are no other alternatives.", "YTA. That is your asset, and you are able to cover that cost on your own. She should be contributing to everything else (utilities, groceries, vacation costs etc). Because it is your asset, and if you want her to contribute to said asset, make a lease, and if you split, she gets those funds back.", "YTA, unless you are also planning to grant her some interest in the equity you will be amassing as a result of the payment.   \n\n\nIt's different from a landlord tenant situation, because while yes it's lower cost, she's not getting any of the benefits ie protections of renting from a landlord.

Instead, she has the insecurity and can be kicked out if you break up or get mad at her.", "YTA - u want her to pay for ur property without earning a share in it.", "YTA.\n\nShe isn't asking to live with you for free.

Use your head. The fact that he was transparent is respectable and reasonable. \n\nAlso, landlords aren\u2019t guaranteed to profit. What if they took out debt to purchase the property and use the rental income to pay of their investment.", "I'm not asking 50/50. that would be $1500 of a $3000 monthly payment", "And that's why she'd only be paying a pittance for rent. $600 elsewhere would barely get you a place with rats or bedbugs.", "and if that doesn't work i wouldn't mind taking up on the offer either!! just please don't mind my pizza addiction", "Not only that, but in most states you have tenant rights even if you don't pay anything.  So whether or not she has a lease she'd have the same legal protection as she does with her current rental.  \n\nI can see why the girlfriend is pushing to not pay, there's literally no downside to it.  Free rent, would need to be legally evicted if they break up and gets OP accustomed to footing her bills.", "So I agree with you about her paying something toward where she lives, but she needs to have some measure of protection in return. You might need to have her sign a lease.", "Did you read the whole comment to which you replied? Because, if you did, the answer to your question should be quite clear. Are you going to give her *all* the benefits of tenancy? Are you going to bear the full financial responsibility for maintenance and repairs, as any landlord would, or would you be expecting her to chip in if you have to, say, replace the furnace or repair the roof, or call an electrician or plumber (even if it's to repair a problem she accidentally caused)? Is she going to be paying, or contributing *at all* to paying, for any kind of improvements, like paint/wallpaper, updates to the house (*e.g.,* new plumbing or lighting fixtures, new flooring, etc.), buying plants for the yard, and so on? Because tenants don't do that, whereas live-in partners often do \u2013 and then when they break up, the one whose name isn't on the deed is out thousands of dollars spent improving and decorating a house they don't own, while the one who owns the house continues to benefit from those improvements financed by the non-owning partner. \n\nIf she's going to have all the drawbacks of homeownership without any of the benefits, then she's in the right. If you want her to pay rent, then she needs to have a lease and all the protections that come with it (including the right not to be thrown out at a moment's notice if the two of you break up).

Month to month is still a lease and still prevents her from being told she has to be out tomorrow or her stuff will be on the lawn.

She could be paying someone else's mortgage for years, have a bad breakup, and also be left with nothing. Why wouldn't you contribute to your boyfriend's mortgage and not some random landlord?

Yes it\u2019s technically his commitment but she is trying to live under his roof and should contribute to the household.

Literally everyone wins here. \n\nWhen I was dating my wife and moved in to her house we split the household expenses pretty much 50/50 as I thought it was fair for me to pay my share of the expenses.

Big brain time. You sure showed them.", "Doesn't matter if it's a different dynamic , doesn't mean she should get to live with him for basically nothing.

And the landlord is not benefitting in any way other than financially from our business arrangement. I am probably paying more than the mortgage and it is understood that the landlord is not providing housing as a charity - they are doing so to make money.\n\nGenerally most people wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with a romantic partner profiting off of them for no reason other than the fact that they can. When I own a house and I ask someone I am romantically involved in to move in with me my mortgage payment does not change. The ulitities and groceries may change and this is something that is reasonable to ask the person to cover. But if I charge them additional money that I use towards my own equity at the end of two years if I decide to walk away from them I have all the money that this person paid into my equity and they have the money they \u201csaved on rent\u201d and one of those two things will appreciate in value over time and the other one will actually be less useful over time because of inflation.\n\nI think you can hold this position but you shouldn\u2019t feel entitled to having things go both ways. You can treat your partner like a tenant but you better be prepared to give them the legal protection of a tenant. The best way I\u2019ve seen this handled is for the person who owns the house to take the \u201crent\u201d and put it into an account that they either give back to the person in the event of a break up (or some agreed upon split of it) or that they use to buy a marital property after getting married and putting wife\u2019s name on the original title.", "Should I ask my bf to pay me for sex?

She isn\u2019t just paying part of the mortgage, she is paying into the expenses of the household, which she is a part of if she moves in.
