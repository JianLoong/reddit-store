It\u2019s never for long. I do get her treats to say thank you. \nFirst off, my sister is in a program that makes it easier for her to finish school ahead of time and graduate early. She\u2019s basically homeschooled. It\u2019s all online. She\u2019s usually very ahead of it so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m interfering with her school. She has a ton of free time ever since she started doing this. I am a single parent who works full-time to support us. I do not have free time. \nFrom when he first came home, if I ever ask for help with him, she gives me this bratty \u201che\u2019s not my kid\u201d response. I was too weak after having my son, so I\u2019d ask her to carry his car seat. He\u2019s a pretty big boy, and those things are super heavy. Every time she\u2019d say \u201che\u2019s not my kid, why do I have to do it?\u201d EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. It got on my nerves so much that I gave up and carried him myself. It hurt, but it was better than listening to her. Now she does it over the smallest things. I\u2019ll ask her to watch him for a second so I can run and do/grab something. If I come back, she\u2019s on her phone paying him no attention. He\u2019ll start doing something he shouldn\u2019t, or be getting into something and I\u2019ll ask why she wasn\u2019t watching him. I\u2019ll get \u201cuh because he isn\u2019t my kid?\u201d\nJust yesterday she spent the night (I live with my grandparents) to make sure my son had a babysitter in the morning when I had to work (we weren\u2019t sure my papa would be home on time). He got home on time so she didn\u2019t have to watch my son. She only got up when I was already walking out of the door to go to work. \nI came home that night and my kid needed a diaper change. My papa was in bed and I asked why she hadn\u2019t changed him. She said she was waiting for papa to do it. She knows he doesn\u2019t change poopy diapers unless he absolutely has to. I was saying me hellos to my happy baby boy so I asked her to grab a diaper and wipes. She sighed but grabbed them. I was trying to change him, but he\u2019s a strong wiggly little lad. I asked her for help distracting him, because she was on her laptop ignoring us. She angrily told me that she had \u201cbeen doing that all day\u201d I told her I do it all day every day. She said that famous \u201cyeah, but he isn\u2019t my kid\u201d line and I lost it. \nI told her to knock it the F off. \u201cYou spent the night to watch your nephew and to help me out. You can help every once in a while without the stupid remarks.\u201d She just looked annoyed and helped. I thought she got the point, but later that night she did the same thing except it was because she was watching tv. I snapped at her this time telling her to knock it off and to grow up. My mom even seemed annoyed this time. \nAm I wrong to snap at her like that? I know he\u2019s not her kid, Should I stop asking her for help?\n\nEdit: she agrees to help out. If she says no, I figure something else out. I\u2019d never force her to do anything. I take care of her as much as my son. I practically raised her (which she will gladly tell people). I help her out with school work when she needs it, buy her anything she wants to say thank you, and she even watches my aunts kids without a single complaint.", "created_utc": 1677789340, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11gd8n5/aita_for_yelling_at_my_sister_for_not_watching_my/", "score": 717, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If someone else is supposed to be in charge of the kid, then she's right: she doesn't have to change diapers just because she's female.  That should be done by whoever is watching the kid.

Don't put additional expectations on her just because of her gender.\n\nShe didn't choose to become a single parent.  So yeah, she's got free time and she's entitled to spend it how she wishes.  Sounds like sometimes that IS watching your kid, just not as much as you want it to be.  Well, that's too bad.  It's not her kid and she's a kid herself, so her assistance should be limited to exactly how much she is willing to give.\n\n>I told her I do it all day every day.\n\nLmao yeah because you're an adult and the parent.

Maybe you should have figured out child care for your son before the pregnancy, or at least during the @ 9 months you had before your son was born.\n\nAlso, apparently she is expected to change diapers, while some other family members aren't. And if I understand the post, you live with your grandparents, your mother, and your sister, even though you have a child of your own. Time for you to be a grown-up and move out.  You need to raise your own child, not expect unwilling family members to do it.", "YTA. Time to buck up and realize you are not entitled to force your underage sister to babysit.

It is the job of her parents to support her.  What are your parents doing?  Is your money going to support her, or is it for you and the baby, while you live with your parents? You mention both your mother and father being there, so you should not be supporting your sister.\n\nThe fact that you have to work to support your child is not a reason for your sister to be expected to do unpaid work for you.\n\nAnd where is your child's father?  Take him to court, get him to pay child support, as is his legal obligation.\n\nETA:\n\nAlso:\n\n>She just looked annoyed and helped.

If she helps a little, you think she's \"learned a lesson\" and expect her to do more.

Have you ever asked her whether she likes babysitting, or whether she even likes kids? And have you ever offered her anything more than treats? \n\nMaybe you need to offer her money instead of expecting her to take care of a tiny, vulnerable human, for treats, which sounds insulting as hell-- you want her to care for your kid, the most precious, vulnerable, important thing in your life--but you're not willing to offer anything of value in return.\n\nYou're expecting a child to be responsible for a newborn. What does a little girl know about babies? Why should she be expected to change diapers because the grown man who's supposed to be watching the baby refuses to?\n\nMaybe your sister is angry and petulant because you seem to have assumed that because she's at home for a large part of the day, and perhaps even because she's a girl, it must mean she's available for and capable of any and all childcare duties. But she isn't available or capable. She's your 15 year old sister and you're kind of treating her like a servant.\n\nAnd it's not a good idea to try and make a 15 year old responsible for an 8 month old baby. God forbid something goes wrong, or the baby gets suddenly ill.

I\u2019m not sure if your own parents parentified you with your sister when you were younger, but your child is your responsibility and if you want care to be done right, you pay a babysitter or use someone that has proven that they are reliable which she isn\u2019t.

It\u2019s never for long. I do get her treats to say thank you. \nFirst off, my sister is in a program that makes it easier for her to finish school ahead of time and graduate early. She\u2019s basically homeschooled. It\u2019s all online. She\u2019s usually very ahead of it so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m interfering with her school. She has a ton of free time ever since she started doing this. I am a single parent who works full-time to support us. I do not have free time. \nFrom when he first came home, if I ever ask for help with him, she gives me this bratty \u201che\u2019s not my kid\u201d response. I was too weak after having my son, so I\u2019d ask her to carry his car seat. He\u2019s a pretty big boy, and those things are super heavy. Every time she\u2019d say \u201che\u2019s not my kid, why do I have to do it?\u201d EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. It got on my nerves so much that I gave up and carried him myself. It hurt, but it was better than listening to her. Now she does it over the smallest things. I\u2019ll ask her to watch him for a second so I can run and do/grab something. If I come back, she\u2019s on her phone paying him no attention. He\u2019ll start doing something he shouldn\u2019t, or be getting into something and I\u2019ll ask why she wasn\u2019t watching him. I\u2019ll get \u201cuh because he isn\u2019t my kid?\u201d\nJust yesterday she spent the night (I live with my grandparents) to make sure my son had a babysitter in the morning when I had to work (we weren\u2019t sure my papa would be home on time). He got home on time so she didn\u2019t have to watch my son. She only got up when I was already walking out of the door to go to work. \nI came home that night and my kid needed a diaper change. My papa was in bed and I asked why she hadn\u2019t changed him. She said she was waiting for papa to do it. She knows he doesn\u2019t change poopy diapers unless he absolutely has to. I was saying me hellos to my happy baby boy so I asked her to grab a diaper and wipes. She sighed but grabbed them. I was trying to change him, but he\u2019s a strong wiggly little lad. I asked her for help distracting him, because she was on her laptop ignoring us. She angrily told me that she had \u201cbeen doing that all day\u201d I told her I do it all day every day. She said that famous \u201cyeah, but he isn\u2019t my kid\u201d line and I lost it. \nI told her to knock it the F off. \u201cYou spent the night to watch your nephew and to help me out.

I thought she got the point, but later that night she did the same thing except it was because she was watching tv. I snapped at her this time telling her to knock it off and to grow up. My mom even seemed annoyed this time. \nAm I wrong to snap at her like that?
