I am not being selfish, if people want to use my stuffs they can as long as they ask and have acceptable reasons.

So the kitchen was a total mess and he was the last person to use it because I saw him yesterday when I went to the bathroom, it was the second time he left the kitchen in a mess after using it. It is also unfair for the next person to use the kitchen and the current person who is assigned to clean the common areas.

From what I gathered, you already tried talking to them and it didn\u2019t help. Having a new roommate without him paying for rent or utilities isn\u2019t great already, but the fact that he is taking your stuff without permission and making a mess is unacceptable. But be aware that they might make your life miserable after you talk to your landlord just for revenge, so make sure you have other place to live just in case.", "Get everything written down. Complain in writing. Messages , emails etc. Also if you have discussed with Z and there has been no change. Tell the landlord.", "NTA take pictures of messes he makes, take pics of you all in the house (get him in them as well), note down all conversations with her about him and his behaviour. You've already mentioned to her that he needs to adjust and pull his little squatter weight if he's going to be there. Chat with the other housemates and see what they think. Draw up a cleaning schedule and include him since he's living there now. Give it another two weeks if no change call a house meeting with the other people and bring it up.

She probably didn't even explain to him that everyone has their own tools which doesn't make any sense.\n\nI think you need to have a housemates meeting all together and discuss the issue before you do anything, focusing on major issues like the messy kitchen. If he uses the flat, he follows the rules as all of you. If he doesn't, his gf is free to clean up after him \u2013\u00a0knowing that this will be her life if she stays with him, and we'll all be waiting for her post on r/relationship_advice.\n\nI had a similar situation when I was a student, not with a bf but directly with a flatmate.

Stack it all in front of her door then. She's being beyond rude and inconsiderate. You're being super gracious by even being ok with him squatting there, basically. All you're asking is for him not to be gross.", "But that has nothing to do with the landlord. The rent is a fixed cost. It makes no difference to him if the rent is being paid from 3 people or 4 people. That's an internal dispute.", "Is your rent inclusive of all bills or are they paid separately? And is it rent per room or you split the rent between you of the whole place? I suppose if it\u2019s bills included then the landlord probably would get involved.

And it does make sense. \n\nI once had this happen to me, but in my case it wasn't entirely my fault. I had bought new towels 3 times in the span of 3 weeks because they kept getting lost. I shared the kitchen with 1 other person. The last time I bought new towels, I made sure to leave them on the counter and remember exactly where I left them. When all the towels were gone once more, I notified my roommate that I was not going to keep buying them. So when I was doing my dishes, I couldn't dry them and left them out to air-dry. This made it so that I couldn't finish all the dishes. The guy then proceeded to chuck everything out the window onto my balcony (which was also connected to the kitchen window) and leave it there. When I confronted him about it he cursed at me for not removing my dishes, so I told him to stop eating dish cloths for breakfast.\n\n*Tbh what did I expect from a guy that snorts coke daily, plays video games until 5AM every day and calls all women \"trash bags\"*", "The landlord rent the room for the girl, the boyfriend is just a visitor but he started living here without the landlord knowing, idc what the landlord will think what I only care and complain is that he is not a tenant here but doesn\u2019t comply by the rules and uses the stuffs of the actual tenants.", "The rent is fixed \n\nBut not the utilities costs", "All of us tenant pay our own rent fee of room then fixed price of the bills.", "Well it\u2019s different here. The landlord has all the power to kick someone out if all the other tenant complain. Again, I don\u2019t care if my flatmate has her bf staying here for whatever how long it is. It\u2019s her business, what I complain here is that they don\u2019t, rather the bf doesn\u2019t comply by the rules we have in the flat. We pay here and he doesn\u2019t so if he wants to live here rent free with his gf then he should comply by the rules and respect the actual tenants. I never said she is not allowed to have visitors but the landlord clearly said no visitors are allowed to stay more than 2 days.", "I have seen people using lock boxes in kitchens and fridges to keep people from using personal belongings / eating your food. Is that an option? \n\nThis doesn\u2019t solve the mess issue but it\u2019s a signal that you are increasingly dissatisfied with the situation.", "If it's a school dormitory with special rules that have been put into the contract, and there's a supervisor, they might care, but if it's a normal apartment, rented on normal terms, I'm having trouble seeing what the landlord could, should, or would want to do about it, unless they're doing direct damage to the property. \n\nIt also depends on whether you have three separate contracts, or if you have a single contract that you signed together. \n\nIf I rent an apartment for myself and someone else moves in with me, that's also my own business, not the landlord's. As long as rent gets paid in full and on time and there's no damage to the property, that's basically the end of our agreement. The rest is internal squabbling that's none of his business.", "Whether or not that's the landlord's business is entirely dependent on the contract. Where I live, utilities are usually handled separately and directly between the utility company and the tenants, and is thus still not the landlord's problem.", "I said mainly that you have to Talk to your flatmates. Now imagine you Go to your landlord and He does nothing cause noone Else has a Problem.\n\nAlso what the hell is those Rules that No one can stay longer than 2 days If any landlord in my country ever implemented such a rule every Court would rule against them.", "And take photos OP, having evidence of the mess will help your case", "I\u2019m pretty sure the landlord doesn\u2019t want freeloaders leaving his property a mess, so he might actually step in if OP tells him what is going on", "I get that I have to talk to my other flatmates and that\u2019s mostly everyone saying in the comments. With his rules, I can\u2019t do anything about that, again he owns the place so he makes the rules. Also, the flat is not that big, the landlord doesn\u2019t know she makes her bf lives here, again, idc if they do this as long as nothing is affected but there is which is him not following the rules and using other people\u2019s stuffs.", "Again: it depends on their contract(s). \n\nA mess is one thing, property damage is something else entirely. Landlords generally don't care about mess, as long as you keep it to the inside. If you damage the property, that's something else.\n\nThere's also a legal aspect here because even if the landlord doesn't like it, it's probably very limited what he can actually do about it. And it's also a question of what incentive he has to act in the first place\n\nIf the landlord is renting the rooms separately and there's a risk that he'll lose 2 tenants because of the 3rd that means that his income gets cut into a 3rd of what it was. \n\nIf they're renting it together on one contract, he'll still get the same amount of money regardless of whether they have to split it in 2, 3 or 4.", "Not Sure where you Live but Just He is the landlord He probably cant make any demand He wants. You Rent the place so its yours. For example If one of His Rules was that all Woman need to be naked at Home and He comes by once a day to controll that would make the Same Sense, Just because someone is a landlord He cant make Up Rules however He wants.", "I live in Poland. The landlord is really kind and the only rule he has is the cleaning schedule and that no visitors should stay longer than two days, we\u2019re in a flat that is highly secured so he doesn\u2019t really want non-tenants staying here for the secure of the place but tbh I dont really care if my flatmates have their visitors and they make them stay but not respecting other tenants, leaving the common space dirty is not acceptable for me, he is literally living here rent free bc of the girl and the landlord doesnt know about it."]}
