When I was looking for a room to rent this flat was available and the landlord told me that there are two other girls living in, when I moved in, a new guy also moved in the same day as me. So we\u2019re only 4 people.\n\nFor the past few months, I noticed the girl from the room 2, let\u2019s call her Z. I noticed that Z is really extrovert and has a guy coming over often, at first I don\u2019t see the guy that much as he\u2019s always in her room. It\u2019s didn\u2019t bother me because maybe he was just visiting and he wasn\u2019t really bothering the other people. Keep in mind, I don\u2019t really care of my housemates bring people, it\u2019s not my business.\n\nBut I noticed that he started to be here around more and started using the common spaces which was not a problem. Problem started happening whenever he will use the common space he doesn\u2019t clean it, I caught him using my stuffs in the kitchen like dishwasher, sponge, some utensils I own and some food products. I am not being selfish, if people want to use my stuffs they can as long as they ask and have acceptable reasons. Z has her own cleaning materials, food products and utensils so I don\u2019t see why he is using some people\u2019s stuff.\n\nToday was my last straw as I head to the kitchen to make myself some breakfast, the kitchen was a total mess. We have a rule in this flat and we are schedules to clean, one person per week to clean. So the kitchen was a total mess and he was the last person to use it because I saw him yesterday when I went to the bathroom, it was the second time he left the kitchen in a mess after using it. It is also unfair for the next person to use the kitchen and the current person who is assigned to clean the common areas. I already talked to them about this but it seems like they are not taking it seriously.

It's unacceptable.", "You should talk to her first and tell her it's not accepta ble.", "Talk to her first", "Abbi? Is Beavers throwing away your coupons again?", "INFO: have you discussed the issue with your flatmates? If not, would suggest doing so before running to the landlord.", "NTA. From what I gathered, you already tried talking to them and it didn\u2019t help. Having a new roommate without him paying for rent or utilities isn\u2019t great already, but the fact that he is taking your stuff without permission and making a mess is unacceptable. But be aware that they might make your life miserable after you talk to your landlord just for revenge, so make sure you have other place to live just in case.", "Get everything written down. Complain in writing. Messages , emails etc. Also if you have discussed with Z and there has been no change. Tell the landlord.", "NTA take pictures of messes he makes, take pics of you all in the house (get him in them as well), note down all conversations with her about him and his behaviour. You've already mentioned to her that he needs to adjust and pull his little squatter weight if he's going to be there. Chat with the other housemates and see what they think. Draw up a cleaning schedule and include him since he's living there now. Give it another two weeks if no change call a house meeting with the other people and bring it up. State your case and make the ultimatum that he starts being clean and respecting the actual rent payers boundaries or you contact the landlord with your evidence and get him and his gf out of there because she's breaking her lease agreement.", "NTA. I would certainly tell the landlord if it was me.", "You wouldn't be an asshole, but you could not win much because she could tell the landlord it's just a boyfriend that often hangs out there, and you'll have an enemy in the house.\n\nWhat I don't understand is if she was following the house rules, why suddenly she doesn't care that her bf doesn't? She probably didn't even explain to him that everyone has their own tools which doesn't make any sense.\n\nI think you need to have a housemates meeting all together and discuss the issue before you do anything, focusing on major issues like the messy kitchen. If he uses the flat, he follows the rules as all of you. If he doesn't, his gf is free to clean up after him \u2013\u00a0knowing that this will be her life if she stays with him, and we'll all be waiting for her post on r/relationship_advice.\n\nI had a similar situation when I was a student, not with a bf but directly with a flatmate.

So I am not accusing him, when I know and I see him using my stuffs and being the last one in the kitchen.", "Landlords can, and will, kick people out of tenancies for stuff like this. Seen it enough over the decades - be it pettiness, or not willing to deal with a house of individuals who can't sort their own problems out, or a stickler to the rules, this can and does happen.", "Then maybe try discussing it with fjatnate first?", "I did discuss it with my flatmate, I mentioned that I don\u2019t mind her having people or someone around but as long as they comply by the rules that we have. She apologized and told she will tell her boyfriend but they never really took it seriously, the boyfriend still doesn\u2019t comply by the rules and kept using my stuffs that I have to put in back in my room bc of it.", "No. Say this is her last warning. If boyf doesn't clean up, then you are talking to the landlord. The next time the kitchen is a mess will be the time that you shop them."]}
