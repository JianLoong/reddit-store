That you make plans and have to cancel/change them?\n\nI\u2019m still leaning towards NTA but if it\u2019s happening too often I can understand her frustration", "NTA. 5th movie? I would have slept too.", "Info: Did you clear the OT or Overrun shift with your wife? Was this day you had planned a one off or something difficult to organise or can you reschedule easily?\n\nI'm a 999 responder myself and when my partner and I make plans we have degrees to how sacrosanct they are. \"Purple protected\" means nothing is allowed to get in their way - usually fixed dates like weddings or special bookings; important-if there is a good reason then you can change plans or encroach on the day; valued - just check before making alternative plans; green - let me know you're cancelling. \n\nOntop of that we have a rule, before we apply for or agree to OT that's in less than 2 weeks time we always get the other to sign off on it.\n\nDepending on how special this day was will answer if you were TA or not.

Your wife is allowed to be mad and sad that you\u2019d planned a nice day together and it didn\u2019t really happen.  She  shouldn\u2019t be taking it out on you - this is a \u201cmad at the universe\u201d or \u201cmad at life\u201d moment.  You did the best you could, but you were in a bind that is sometimes part of the job when you work in any part of emergency services.  Maybe try to plan something nice but smaller and more attainable in the near future?  Have the nice picnic where you proposed and splurge a little on something nice that you both enjoy for that, like some charcuterie or a fancy dessert you never buy but love, for example.  Make whatever you do a special treat, but make it a manageable size one.", "INFO: what would the consequences have been if you had refused to work late?", "I think the issue is your wife is just more clutch on the golf course", "NAH, but you need to make sure you prioritise having some time together. My partner is self employed and works an awful, awful lot, and even though I know he's doing it for us, the fact that our last day out together was November (and before that it had been a year) does make you sad, even if your relationship is an absolute dream.", "Anyone do the math? OP slept for 11 hours strait. Then fell back to sleep during the movie night. Why did you need that much sleep? Was that ot shift 36 hours long?", "NTA It sounds like you needed a lot of sleep by many people's standards but working in a high stress job even without the funny hours that can happen - high cortisol levels, adrenal fatigue, it happens.

Burnout's no fun my friend.", "YTA.\n\n\\>woke up at 12:45 pm so we didn't really have time for the golf because my wife couldn't wake me up.\n\nYour wife shouldn't even have to wake you up. You could have set several alarms. I understand you had work and that being a 911 operator is a stressfull job but 1:30 am is not even that late. I bet you stay up later watching movies. Had you come home at 8 am, that would have been different.\n\nDid you even text your wife that you would be staying later due to your work being short of staff and kinda warn her that your plans would be cancelled if you know you would be that tired?", "YTA, you should have set your alarm. You can go one day with 5 hours of sleep you slept for over 11 hours that\u2019s total bs. Even eight hours would have put you awake by 930. You are definitely the AH. Also set an alarm, you just didn\u2019t care and it showed", "NTA but it seems like you have different expectations for what to do on your day off. I felt tired just reading the planned activities.", "I'd be pretty pissed if I were your wife. I get the work thing but you could have tried harder. Fucking McDonald's? YTA. You need to make it up to her in a big way ASAP, after she's cooled down. My guess is that if you had a golf date set up with a friend you would have hauled your ass out of bed on time.", "I'm gonna say NTA because your job requires you to do things and leave other things behind but maybe you could try to have a backup plan for when it happens again, so it doesn't have to be a mess? Like if you sleep till late because she can't wake you up, that's no one's fault but your plan could say that if that happens then its okay to plan the rest of the day for herself and move your plans for this day to another. Maybe that would make you feel less bad when you have to miss a day of fun things and she can just do her own thing without waiting for you to wake up and such?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The phrase \"life happens while you are planning other things\" comes to mind here.  Was this a special day? Like an anniversary of some kind?\n\nCan you reschedule your plans?

Didn't take me home at the end of shift though).\n\nMore concerning to me is the dudes slept for 10 hours and blames it on working late.", "People\u2019s lives could be on the line? Op is a 911 dispatcher. One less dispatcher means longer hold times for emergency calls, putting peoples lives in danger.

It's not OP's problem that somebody couldn't come in.  It's the fault of the city council for not providing enough budget to properly staff the center, or it's the fault of the scheduling manager for not scheduling enough backup help.
