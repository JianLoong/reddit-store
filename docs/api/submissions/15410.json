It\u2019s only abandonment if I leave my shifts assigned patients. I am not legally required to stay past my shift. If a nurse doesn\u2019t show up I give report to the charge nurse and they have to deal with it. It would be abandonment if I left the patient with no care in an active emergency. \n\n In many states that is not abandonment. A lot of facilities will tell you it\u2019s abandonment but all of the states I\u2019ve worked at they would be lying. It might be a violation of your contract with them but you have to check your state laws to see if it\u2019s legally abandonment. It\u2019s important nurses know their rights and check what is abandonment because some facilities absolutely take advantage of nurses who don\u2019t understand the law. You don\u2019t have to work yourself to death just because your job told you that you do. Hospitals being criminally understaffed is not your fault as a nurse. Protect your patients, but don\u2019t forget to protect yourself and your well being.\n\nOne of the most devastating parts of being a nurse in the US is when you realize you work in a system that doesn\u2019t actually care about patients and certainly doesn\u2019t give a fuck about the employees. except for maybe doctors because they\u2019re the ones who get the insurance more money. 98% of the nurses, PTs, RTs, OTs, STs, CNAs I\u2019ve worked with care deeply for their patients which makes it much easier for companies to guilt you into doing more work.\n\nNot trying to disagree with you because for all I know that could be considered abandonment in some states, but all the ones I\u2019ve checked (like 5 or 6) it is not. I think you made a good point about not know if the OP had mandatory overtime. But I just think it\u2019s important nurses know to check their states laws because plenty of jobs I\u2019ve worked will imply it\u2019s abandonment even though they very well know it is not.", "As a 999 staff if you're on a job (on scene) then you're OT lasts until you're relieved or you're clear of the scene/job.

My wife needs more like 10 hours or she is exhausted all day. Works out fine for me because I just get an extra 4 hours a day to clean the house or do my own thing.

My husband's department has been working at minimum staffing levels for YEARS. And it's not budgeting or scheduling but staffing issues. There aren't enough qualified candidates. Quite a few that are hired don't make it through probation. Huge amount of turnover. Some decide the job isn't for them. Some leave because a spouse isn't happy. It's a small department so quite a few leave to go to larger departments with more opportunities.\n\nMy husband's department isn't even cool with people taking sick leave. On more.thannone occasion they have sent people to someone's house to check if they actually are sick. My husband had Covid last fall. Department policy was a mandatory 5 days off and after that you could come back after a negative Covid test. My husband needed more than the 5 days and his supervisor was PISSED. When he went back he had a negative test but was still coughing and having breathing issues.\n\nThen in December he got the really nasty flu that was going around and had to take a week off. In his yearly evaluation he got SEVERELY dinged for taking sick leave. Nevermind that the Covid sick leave was department policy and mandatory. Supervisor pointed out that he hadn't taken a SINGLE sick day in FIVE years so he was really disappointed in the amount of sick leave he took this last year. No grace with the fact that he hadn't taken any sick leave in 5 years.\n\nBecause of that eval he's now on a short leash and was told his performance was going to reviewed in 3 months time to assess whether he had come back up to satisfactory standards. So it's great to say it isn't OP's problem or that it\u2019s just \"sentiment\" but that is just not how shit works. If OP says \"Fuck it, my shift is over so I'm leaving\", OP may not have a job to come back to.", "Not if you physically can\u2019t be woken up. If his wife couldn\u2019t get him to wake up, an alarm won\u2019t necessarily wake him up either.", "Why 5 movies too? That seems excessive. Idk when it gets dark there but it seems like they could have played 9 holes in the afternoon, then did dinner and like 1 movie. Makes more sense than mcdonalds and 5 movies?", ">There aren't enough qualified candidates.\n\nThat sounds like a budgeting issue.  Everyone knows the job is tough, but people would be willing to work it if it paid what it's worth.  If a tough job pays $15/hr, why would anyone work that when Target is hiring for the same rate.  If you got paid $35/hr (plus overtime), I'd expect you'll see more people applying.\n\n>My husband's department isn't even cool with people taking sick leave\n\nThat sounds like a toxic environment that makes $15/hr even less worth it.  Why would I work somewhere that's high stress, won't let me be sick, and pays $15/hr when I can go somewhere that at least isn't as high stress while at work.  Target may not be happy when I'm sick, but at least I'm not going to listen to someone die on the other end of the phone regularly.\n\n>If OP says \"Fuck it, my shift is over so I'm leaving\", OP may not have a job to come back to.\n\nThis sounds like management guaranteeing they won't have enough people.  They have one good person they get for 40 hours/week, and they get rid of him just because they don't get him for an extra 8 hours on no notice.  Now, instead of having someone for 40 hours, they get someone for 0.\n\nI understand the idea that you can't just quit a job if you have no savings and aren't ready.  However, management is looking only short term by solving today's problem by threatening to fire someone for being sick.  They might get a dispatcher for that shift, but they lose one in three weeks when he finds a new job.  He then tells his friends about how the environment was toxic, so nobody applies to fill his place.\n\n>On more.thannone occasion they have sent people to someone's house to check if they actually are sick.\n\nYes, rather than filling in for the sick person, it's better to have them become a private investigator and stalk the sick person.  That's a great use of resources.", "I\u2019m fascinated by this. This is a cultural divide I did not know existed. \n\nIt is management\u2019s problem, I agree. But literally, what do they *do*? If there\u2019s a snowstorm and people can\u2019t get to the hospital? Or if there\u2019s a flu going around and there just aren\u2019t enough healthy people to fully staff? Does management hit the floor themselves? How did you guys manage during the worst parts of the pandemic?\n\nAnd this question, I swear, is with no judgement: how do you emotionally handle leaving when you know you have no replacement? \n\nMost states in the US have some kind of six-in-seven law, meaning you cannot be scheduled 7 continuous days in a row (for most jobs, not all).\n\nIndividual companies or unions can demand X amount of time between shifts. Some states have laws regarding rest for specific jobs. But overall there are usually no laws in regards to this. In service industries we call this a \u201cclopen\u201d\u2014when you work close till 1am and open at 6am.", "Interesting. Just a difference in terminology here. \n\nTypically if we say someone works at 911 they are a dispatcher (the occasional admin types as well). First Responders tend to be the ones that go to scene. (This causes some issues as many feel dispatcher should be included as first responders. Also, EMTs get tougher too as it really only those who respond to 911 calls considered first responders not the IFT folks. Other definitions of first responder are even more inclusive and include things like nurses).\n\nThe 911 call centers have legally required staffing levels, so if someone calls out sick and they can't find a replacement, you can be held over as 'mando' (mandatory overtime). Mine actually had a room with beds and such if you were held long enough it wasn't safe to drive afterwards (only saw them used once during a natural disaster). \n\nStaffed first responders have a similar deal as well (different for volunteers who can't just leave a scene but have no response requirements), if a paid firefighter is held over for Mando, it doesn't matter whose wedding is the next day, you are legally required to stay. (Funny song about here spoofing We Don't Talk About Bruno, [\"We Don't Talk About Mando\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DknMBRrQvI)).\n\nNormally admin tries to be good about it so if someone just worked a 24 hr shift and has a mandatory follow, they will try and call someone from the next shift in early so it is 12 mando and 12 starting early... but they can only do what they can do. \n\nIt can suck, but it is part of the job and they are upfront about it. OT is good enough that even though cops and firefighters are not the highest paid, the top 10 highest paid city or county employees in the vast majority of municipalities are almost always police SGT and fire LT (above city managers and lawyers).\n\nIn this case, as a 911 dispatcher, it is unlikely the wife had any say at all, no matter how important the date was to them. But... while 10 hours is not same crazy amount of time to sleep that people should be shamed for, it is more than is needed to get up and participate in a super important date with the wife... yeah, you might be tired but if it was important you do it.", "NAH I think--tho that depends on how you both go forward.\n\n1) you had exigent circumstances.  with the extra shift and late getting home.\n\n2) she has right to feel hurt.  \n\nMake sure you figure out when you can do a \"make-up\" day.", "INFO: how in the world did you stay awake for four movies and part of a fifth? My ADHD could never \ud83d\ude31", "Five movies is insane. Which movies", "Yeah so you slept over 11hrs straight.. YTA", "NTA.. there are plans and then there is life. You can try again.", "NTA. You did what you had to do and of course you were tired. I get she was disappointed but there will be other days. And you did hang out some. Time to get past it.", "NTA you had to work late in an extremely stressful job, of course you needed to sleep in a bit. It\u2019s not like the day was a waste, you still had your picnic and watched a bunch of movies together. Sounds pretty nice to me.", "\u201cClear with your wife?\u201d Holy shit.", "I\u2019m sure the wife didn\u2019t want to watch 5 movies either, but there plans got messed up", "FIVE MOVIES.", "Sounds like he desperately needed the sleep, and I'm not sure why the wife didn't remember the food.", "No way I could enjoy a day out on 6 hours sleep, I would be wrecked", "i wonder. i know that in certain jobs, if the replacement is not present, it is illeagal to sign off (see: nursing).\n\nits possible 911 operator is such a job, and that he is describing such a case.", "There is no difference in terminology. \"999 staff\" in the UK does 100% mean the dispatchers.  We use \"paramedic\", \"police\", \"fire service\" to refer to the actual responders."]}
