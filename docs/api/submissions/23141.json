I was talking to him last night and he mentioned that my mom took him to get his hair cut. She immediately grabbed the phone and started to try and explain herself away about how his hair was in his face when he swims and it\u2019s a safety issue. I internally flipped out for two reasons. \n1) He had been growing his hair out to be cut a certain way for the beginning of school, his choice. Now I have to deal with him being bummed about it because she totally manipulated him. \n2) She did the same thing 15 years ago with my 2 daughters. They had hair to their waist and she cut it up to their shoulders. She shrugged it off and told me to calm down because it\u2019s just hair but it got her in a 10 year TO over it. I thought she had learned her lesson about it, guess not. \n\nI was so pissed about it I couldn\u2019t speak and when she asked if I was mad, I just hung up the phone. He has to stay for 3 more weeks as I unenrolled him from daycare for this trip and can\u2019t get him back in. After this, she is back in TO indefinitely. I\u2019m done and over it. I called my som back and talked to him and played it off so he wouldn\u2019t get upset but told him he has to power to speak up or call me. I know she would never do anything where he would get hurt or anything serious, it\u2019s just this petty shit to taunt me that she\u2019s done for years with my kids. \n\nHere is where I need to know if I\u2019m an AH. My dad called me and said my mom has been upset and crying for 3 days and I should talk to her, it\u2019s just hair. I explained to him that I would not apologize, she took it upon herself to do something she knows not to do, she knew she was wrong and that is why she\u2019s upset and crying because I never said 1 word to her about it. He had me on speaker and she started crying again and he called me an AH then hung up on me. \n\nSo what say ye?", "created_utc": 1690324626, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/159nigb/aita_for_making_my_mom_cry/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It would be one thing if this had not occurred before but you had mom in a TO for ten years prior because a similar stunt?? Come on! She knew what she was doing!", "Thank you!
