You were naked and on the toilet but she was also at the hospital with your son and you said this is stressful for all of you.\n\n\nWhat do you gain by not apologizing for hurting her feelings? I totally understand that you feel justified and if you were in normal circumstances, yeah she would totally be overreacting but, maybe it\u2019s worth it now to just say sorry because it\u2019s not worth adding extra tension when your life is already so hard.", "EDIT based on OP's comments YTA. You wrote an almost perfect apology then fumbled at the end. Sending the Key and Peele sketch didn't help. If anything watching that sketch should show you how you messed up. That sketch is about this issue. \n\n\nINFO Tone is not always clear in text. \"What is it\" can sound rude or dismissive, especially since it's your sick son that she is calling about and you know that. If you had said \"I'm on the toilet, I'll call right back\" I don't think there would be an issue. \n\nTaking that into consideration are you willing to communicate with your wife and apologize?

It would be inappropriate for you to answer a face time while naked and shitting. Obviously you are not in the wrong. Also you aren't \"blunt\" in a bad way.
