It would be inappropriate for you to answer a face time while naked and shitting. Obviously you are not in the wrong. Also you aren't \"blunt\" in a bad way.

A lot of people who face that just mostly want to know that their partner and the other parent of their child is there, and they're not just going through this alone helpless with their child.\n\nI suspect the denied call alone was not the final trigger, but the fact that he followed up with an emoji text to further dismiss the moment (even unintentionally), and took that extra time to do so, was just too much for her at that moment.  \n\nIt is hard to explain and understand if you've never sat next to a child, watching them suffer, and wishing you could do anything other than just sit and wait and see how things unfold.", "Oh wow, thank you!
