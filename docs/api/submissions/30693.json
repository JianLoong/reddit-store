It was lunch time and I was eating my lunch, which was friend chicken and rice that I bought from a local restaurant. At that time I was going to join the tryouts for Taekwondo sports club. One of my classmates, 19M let's call him George. George, who is an archer, told me that if I wanted to join a sport I should eat more healthier and go on a diet. My other male classmates laughed and said that why would he want me to go on a diet if I already was so thin. But George continued on and on about how I should learn to eat more healthier if I wanted to be fit. I understood his point but I just couldn't take it. He has always told me to go on a diet as he'd often see me eating foods that are considered not so healty. At this point, I snapped. I told him in a modulated voice: \"Why do you keep bugging me about going on a diet? Do you have any idea what I have been through?.\" He just smirked and said: \"chill.\" That's when I really lost it, and I revealed that I have been suffering from an eating disorder hence why I am eating foods like this or even not eat at all. George just said nothing and left. He and I haven't spoken after that. I started feeling quite guilty as I thought my behavior has quite irrational but he has been bugging me since the beginning.

Whilst not the healthiest reaction for you or your mental health because of dealing with the stress and anxiety from getting healthy. Please, please, please do what\u2019s best for you to be happy and healthy. You have a whole lifetime to establish healthy eating habits and change your diet to a healthier one. Getting to a healthy weight first is always most important when battling discorded eating \nhabits. Doctors will say this and are very vocal about it with malnourished children. \n\nThe only thing I would suggest for you is finding verbiage you\u2019re comfortable using when addressing your healing process so that you don\u2019t have to wait until people either stop or you finally are done sugar coating things. Maybe saying you have a medical supervision for your medical conditions and you don\u2019t need anyone input about your treatment. And leave it at that. \n\nI wish you the happiest future and am cheering you on for taking care of yourself!!!! That\u2019s the hardest thing we have to do most of the time.

It is rude to comment on other people's food choices or bodies. Did you ask him?", "NTA, you stood your ground and communicated to George that his persistent commentary on your food choice wasn't welcome\n\nBut I do think this is shit communication on George's part. It's not super uncommon for people involved in sport to talk about \"diet\" (the collection of foods you eat) and nutrition on a whole because it can definitely impact performance. You do need to have a particular diet to support building muscle and the energy needed to succeed. \n\nNow, once again, George's commentary wasn't asked for, so he's definitely in the wrong here.", "NTA You stood your ground", "NTA you could have had any number of reasons for eating what you chose. Dietary restrictions, budget, time etc and it really is not Georges business what you eat (if it's not his lunch) its between you (and your medical team). Eating disorders are hard to overcome and this internet stranger is so proud of you. Keep working through it you're doing great job.", "NTA. He has no business policing other people\u2019s diet.", "NTA. Some guys think constantly chipping away at a girl's self esteem is how you get her to date you. Dollars to doughnuts thats why he was obsessively coming after you for your diet.\n\nEdit; you don't specify a gender in your post but you do call out that the classmates were both males, so I have assumed.

By being insistent, he invited the reaction he got. \n\nAlso, Taekwondo is the best thing I have ever done for myself, it's great regardless of body type. I  hope you went to the tryouts and made the team, good luck!", "NTA. George is a gigantic gaping asshole, and your friends are not much better since they didn't help you shut him down. Don't doubt yourself on this.", "Nobody TA . You\u2019re not TA if you had an eating disorder and George sounds like he is coming from a place of concern. Probably believes he is being supportive - tough love and all that. We all need friends like George who will possibly tell us something we don\u2019t want to hear but need to. I understand your frustration as the constant banging on but the fact that he demonstrated consistency goes a lot in his favour because if it came out of the blue then perhaps he is playing to the crowd or undermining you in front of company. Perhaps talk to George. Wishing you well I had a few friends with eating disorders and didn\u2019t fare well.", "YTA.  Listen to people.  Malnutrition is not good for you.  George may be a tactless clod but he cares about you and knows things about health that you want to ignore.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is your choice what you eat, and George can shove it up his backside. You snipping back is something anyone might do if badgered, do not over think it and make yourself feel guilty.", "NTA - Your feelings are valid. Therapy could help you maybe to switch over to more healthy food.\n\nAnd while George is not wrong (diet does not mean losing weight per se) about eating healthy if you want to get fit (even without doing a sport, though if you are then diet becomes way more important) he shouldn't have pushed it.", "NTA.

I never would see myself commenting on other People's weight or diet as I know how it can affect people.

An athlete, trying to give dietary advice to someone else who is trying to become an athlete (going for taekwondo tryouts) because a healthy diet is insanely important for athletes. \n\nWas he overstepping, maybe, but it sounds like he was trying to be genuinely helpful.", "Don\u2019t listen to this one, he\u2019s making assumptions just like Not a Doctor George. People like to give unsolicited advice on diet to feel more in control with their lives and usually to fill their ego. Listen to that have an understanding, education on the subject and above all your trust. If George is the type that\u2019s pushing protein powder, be really cautious on \u201csupplements\u201d and meal replacements. Just because someone has 10% body fat doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not a cancerous tumor growing inside them.", "George was completely overstepping the second time he brought it up and was trying to give advice like a professional on a serious situation for her.
