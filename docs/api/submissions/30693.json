This is why people should stay out of other peoples business.

A period after that, I ate bad food since it was either that or too-little/nothing.\n\nTalking about what to eat to do a sport is fine.

George sounds annoying but unlike most comments suggest I don't think he was doing it maliciously as he's watching you eat crap all day and didn't know about your past, I don't think he had any ill intentions just trying to look out for your fitness as your about to be joining a sport. The rest of reddit will hivemind prosecution because reddit loves a good villain but in reality, it's not a big ordeal at all.", "YTA \n\nPeople don't know what's going on in your life any more than you know what's going on in theirs. You asked him \"Do you have any idea what i have been through?\" and you didn't provide his answer, which leads to a deduction that he didn't know what you've been through. While he may have not had a delicate or consoling response, it also doesn't sound like he would intentionally be a jerk if he was aware of your situation, and to place motivation on his potential ignorance isn't logical. That's the basis of my YTA opinion. \n\nAs far as eating healthier while being involved in sports, that's just common sense. While I won't also apply motivation or intention from George because you haven't clarified that in the story, I will opine on the common sense because athletic performance is proven it can be hindered by poor diet, which is what I have taken away from George's remarks according to what you have written.\n\nThere is no need to snap at people when you are also ignorant of their motivation or intention. Anyone and everyone should and CAN have a calm and clear conversation about lifestyle choices, life experiences, boundaries, and behaviours like adults, HOWEVER, at the age of nineteen, you are both still in the early stages of developing these life skills. I wouldn't hold George to account on his behaviour and I suspect George won't hold you to account on yours.\n\nIf you sit down and talk with George about the incident and choose to confide in him the details of your situation, you both might be surprised with what you can learn.\n\nLiving with an open and loving heart is the best way to be... as hippie dippy cliche as that might sound.", "ESH honestly,\n\nYeah he could have acted way more adult - but you on the other hand too\n\nsince you guys are pretty young, you both got a lot to learn", "NTA.
