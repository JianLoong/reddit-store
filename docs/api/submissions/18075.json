A five year old is plenty old enough to understand being responsible for not making a mess. Spill something? Clean it up and move on. Mise en place and clean as you go. No reason for any clean up after a meal except what you ate off and putting away leftovers. Now is the time for your daughter to learn those life skills so she isn't yet another supplicant on r/Cooking heading off to college without being able to feed herself. \n\nFor a presumably fully functioning adult to blow up a kitchen, including and perhaps especially when cooking with a child, should be embarrassing. It isn't like (I presume) you made a pastry from scratch for chicken pot pie and had flour on the counter (which you could have cleaned as soon as the pie went in the oven). Or any pastry or pasta from scratch. You AND your wife had to stay up late to clean the kitchen. That is pretty big mess. How did you do that?

She won't get shop either - I recommend the Sunset books so she can hang a curtain rod, change a tire, and unclog a sink or toilet. \n\nSo you're an A H for making a mess in the kitchen regardless of motives and setting a bad example for your daughter. MIL is definitely an A H for her treatment of you, especially in front of your daughter. Wife comes through with flying colors - she took the mess in stride, took the effort in the spirit intended, and pitched in to help clean up the kitchen. She probably thinks of it as *her* kitchen since you say you rarely cook and she's been home for five years. Chew on that for a while. Daughter is five and doesn't know any better because you haven't taught her better. You and your wife are accountable for daughter's contribution to the mess. \n\nTL;DR: NTA but lots of work to do.", "NTA.
