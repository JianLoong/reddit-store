I did something similar when I was your age. Thankfully my parents appreciated my chipping in. Most of my gifts came from Santa or went in their stockings so my brothers wouldn\u2019t know they were from me. I gave a small gift from myself.  I wanted my family to have fabulous Xmas memories.", "NTA I love that your first instinct is to use your money to buy Christmas gifts.", "NTA - you have a generous heart and your mom had no right to criticize you", "NTA. Your mother is embarassed and ashamed of her present financial situation. But that is not your fault. I think it is nice that you are making sure that your siblings have gifts for Christmas. I hope you didn't dip too deep into your savings to get the gifts. It is wise to save up for the future.", "You're literally Santa", "NTA\n\nYour mom does look bad, but not because of anything you did\n\n>She told me I was doing it to hurt her and to spite her\n\nThat some r/raisedbynarcissists bullcrap right there", "NTA. Op you are not the asshole here. Your mum feels insecure about their current money troubles and taking it out on you. Wrong move. As a parent, it\u2019s our job to provide for you. She probably feels incredibly guilty and like she\u2019s not doing enough as a mother. It\u2019s never your job as an older sibling to take on that responsibility. It\u2019s amazing that you can afford a to and enjoy doing it. You\u2019re doing nothing wrong but being a loving caring older sibling. Stay that way. Your mum will come around eventually", "Woah! Mom is way out of line. She can't afford gifts? OK this happens. But isn't it great that you CAN and the kids will get Christmas gifts anyway? She is projecting onto you. The thing is, while not your fault, she is feeling like a bad mother for not being able to handle Christmas this year. Cut her some slack and tell her that you don't blame her and these things happen, you WANT to help with Christmas. Ask her what she would be comfortable with you helping out. The problem isn't you spending money it's her being unable to do so. Take it with a grain of salt. NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your mom is unfairly taking her anger out on you because the fact that you can afford Christmas gifts for your siblings and she can\u2019t is a blow to her self esteem. I feel for your mom, it\u2019s horrible for a parent to feel they can\u2019t adequately provide for their children. Her lashing out is understandable, but that does not in any way make it okay. You\u2019re just trying to be a good big sister and help out. Unfortunately a lot of people see taking any form of help as an insult. It\u2019s a shame.", "That's too bad that you are going to need to return your mother's gifts and spend that money on your siblings.\n\nNTA.", "NTA It's not ok what your mom's doing. It sounds like she is very ashamed, embarrassed, and feeling inadequate. Instead of feeling those things which are very uncomfortable feelings it's easier to channel all those emotions into anger and take it out on you. If she doesn't have a history of this type of behavior she is simply having a hard time right now and will likely regret how she has treated you. If this is common behavior for her unfortunately she likely has little to no emotional intelligence and probably isn't even able to consciously recognize any of those emotions beyond the anger. Either way you are not in the wrong though.", "NTA.\n\n1 didn\u2019t know\n\n2 most teens would buy for themselves not others", "NTA.\n\nStop apologising. You did nothing wrong. It's your mother who needs to apologise to you. She has known you your whole life, and still insults you by claiming you are only buying Christmas gifts to undermine her. As if she doesn't know your character at all.\n\nGiven all the other details in your post, I'm going to assume you have a generally good relationship with your mum and she's a good parent who just had a bad moment. I'm sorry you got caught up in her stress, but she's being entirely unfair to you.\n\nMaybe give her some space and see if she approaches you once she calms down. You are not to blame for her issues with money and she should not have taken her insecurities out on you. If this goes on for a few days, you may have to be the emotionally mature one, approach her and calmly tell her you are not ok with how she attacked you for trying to show your love & appreciation for your family. Hopefully that won't be necessary.", "I bought a few gift cards and clothes and a game my brother really wanted so I didn\u2019t get much but I still wanted to get them something", "Narcissism is a bit of a leap and would require a lot more info to substantiate. I do agree mum made herself look bad and needs to apologise.", "I asked her if she needed any help with Christmas this year, I told her my siblings won\u2019t know I helped and that she wouldn\u2019t need to pay me back or anything and she turned it down. It happens a lot when she complains about money but then when I offer to help acts offended", "That's a beautiful thing you tried to do. I'm sorry your mom reacted that way. Most parents would be moved to tears to have a kid like you.", "For reals! You are an incredible teenager! This is your mom\u2019s issue. I have 12, 14, 17 y/o. They wouldn\u2019t think yo buy for eachother with their own money on their own. It is generous, kind, and super thoughtful of you! This internet mom is sooo proud of you!"]}
