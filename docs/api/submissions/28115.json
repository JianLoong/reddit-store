Why are you buying HER family things? \n\nGet yourself together, get yourself some therapy and let her do her own thing if that means she goes back home then that's what happens.", "Grief is not an excuse for her behavior. I would seriously consider spending at least 30 days apart and see if you\u2019re even still interested in the relationship after the break.", "Why are paying for her family? That's highly unusual in any culture I know of. And it has nothing to do with grief.\n\n If you remove everything in your post about the child then this reads like an account of a financially abusive relationship I would definitely say NTA and I would advise you to seek help about this because with the information posted here it really looks like your being taken for a ride.", "NTA, you need to cut  your losses and move on from her and her family. Unless you enjoy being a doormat that she does not care about.", "So sorry about your child. If it's too painful to talk about I understand. How did each of your react to the death? How did things change? Did she work before she got pregnant?", "Dude, punctuation!", "This was a sad read. I\u2019m truly so sorry for your loss. NTA and I don\u2019t agree with how your girlfriend has been treating with you but I do think after going through such a heartbreaking and traumatic experience her behaviour could very likely be as a result of this (or at least her negative traits amplified). Grief is a tricky thing and I think both of you could benefit with professional help through this. I don\u2019t know the circumstances re why you are expected to financially support your girlfriends family but this situation doesn\u2019t sound fair - why aren\u2019t they supporting themselves / paying for their own meals? Please set some firm boundaries and don\u2019t let anyone take advantage of you. Best of luck.", "Nta send her home and be separate for a bit, your parent shouldn\u2019t make your life harder. You need time alone to figure out if you really want this. \n\n\nI would be gone gone once that lazy comment left her mouth", "NAH. You\u2019ve both been through a traumatic event. I\u2019m sorry that the burdens are falling on you. Your GF absolutely needs to get to therapy. Be very careful about lending her family money, though. It\u2019s unclear exactly what led to that. If you\u2019re trying to help her get through a temporary period of grief-related unemployment that\u2019s one thing, but she HAS to go to therapy and I\u2019m not sure why anyone other then your GF would be entitled to loans from you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You also deserve a chance to grieve. You don\u2019t have to light yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. \n\nI can\u2019t bring myself to call her an AH though since I don\u2019t know where her head is at.

But get out now.", "Honestly i never even considered therapy for myself that\u2019s probably a good idea thank you", "The main issue with this is its very recent the funeral is in 2 weeks time and i love her and her family alot while i agree time would be nice to have as the stress of all this is alot i dont want to make it look like i was only there for my son as i will be slated by my family and hers it would be even more backlash for me", "Im never great with money but im definitely better off than most so i like to help out but i see your point its not helping anyone i will definitely book some therapy for myself in the coming days", "It\u2019s strange it was obviously traumatic but not unexpected we knew it was a possibility so i think we were both mentally prepared for the journey we had ahead of us, currently she\u2019s ok still laughing and acting as if nothing has changed its still very recent we haven\u2019t had the funeral yet so I don\u2019t think its kicked in yet and when it does she lashes out on me and she worked part time but it was 15 hours a week and quit immediately after finding out she was pregnant I didn\u2019t mind as i make a good wage and own my own property", "Thank you this is really what im hoping is she is just struggling to control emotions currently but professional help is off the table as she refuses i fear putting her in a different environment it could amplify it more but i will definitely focus on boundaries more.", "Exactly my thoughts I don\u2019t want to make her feel unwanted i lovw her alot but i also don\u2019t want to be an emotional punching bag when we should be going through it together. Thank you for your kind words", "I understand your point im not upset she\u2019s unhappy its understandable especially in this situation i have tried to make any sort of conversation about emotions and im ignored i just want to be there for her but it\u2019s difficult especially since therapy has been taken off the table in her words and nothing cheers her up apart from getting her out the house and doing stuff for or with her family", "I appreciate your thoughts i will set boundaries and try to talk also get myself in some therapy at the very least sometimes things do just take time to work out", "you lost a child too, not just her.", "I lost a child a few years back and therapy was such a huge tool for me. I cannot recommend it enough. Keep your head up. Contrary to what I see a lot online, it does get better and easier.", "What\u2019s they to love? She sounds mean and lazy and couodnt even care fir you when you have covid after you do everything for her. A 20 year old woman should be working (I know people with cancer who are working\u2026!), although she\u2019s little excused after baby has passed away. Your baby passed away too btw & YOUR feelings are just as important. Stop being an ATM and car service to people who dont seem to care about you.", "So is she acting the same as she was before? Making you drive her places and being rude to you? It's not a trauma response but how she always acts?", "You say together but you're both very young and grief is a devastatingly lonely path. For some people (like me) it's also a violent, destructive process. Just try to keep each other in sight and be gracious if your relationship doesn't survive it.", "If I had to guess, though logically I can't assume anything, but if I had to guess, from your own poor wording here, you're simply not using the right language.\n\nStart with 'How are you feeling?' And continue with 'Why?' If she's anything like most humans, distraction itself will help, so, look at her own interests and what she enjoys, and help distract here.\n\nMaking work itself sound like a promising distraction may help. But it will all come down to your own words.", "She\u2019s always had this mentality since she was pregnant but always appreciated what i did now its expected it\u2019s always been the same if im upset she\u2019s more upset and angry at me for some reason she\u2019s always been hard headed and stubborn when it comes to talking about feelings and always has brushed me off but equally we\u2019ve had some good breakthroughs too with some persistence.", "I am very sorry for the loss of your child, but it might be a good time to re-evaluate your future with your GF.  She showed you that she expects you to pay for her, drive her around and basically do everything once you have kids.  If that\u2019s the future you want, fine.  If it\u2019s not, it might be time to separate."]}
