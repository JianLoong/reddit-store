I have 2 older children from my prior marriage that ended after 12 years. I have 50/50 custody as I thought this was ideal during a hard time in their lives to have us both around as much as possible. My boyfriend met my children about 6 months into our relationship as I did not want to rush it and they love him. We all click together well and everyone enjoys having him around. He\u2019s become more involved with sports and their daily activities as much as he can. He\u2019s great with them and he\u2019s a great partner, truly is my best friend. He has no children himself and has never been married but he\u2019s seemed to thoroughly enjoy being around us all. He asks how they are when we speak on the phone, he talks to them, etc. \nAll of this was great until this past weekend, it was my child\u2019s birthday and we had set plans to do activities with her plus cake all together. The kids were excited and so was I. He canceled the evening he was supposed to arrive and thus, I had to tell the kids and disappoint them that plans had changed. I was frustrated and told him that I completely understand traveling is hard, I get it. I would just like to know that we\u2019re working towards an end goal together of being in one home again and able to do these type of things together. To which he replied that he wasn\u2019t sure and did not know if it would happen. I was hurt and said if we\u2019re in a long term relationship then what is the goal here? I\u2019m fine not remarrying, but I would love to have my partner all the time. We went back and forth and he said he\u2019ll be here next weekend to visit. I told him I\u2019d like to keep all visits to weekends when the kids will be with their dads for the foreseeable future until we figure what\u2019s going to happen with our relationship. He replied I was punishing him for not making it this past weekend and that I\u2019m keeping the kids from him. I want to protect my children and the more time they spend together the worse it\u2019s going to hurt if things end up not working out.

Kids can take breakups just as hard as the couple involved.  NTA.", "Sounds to me like he either didn't give a good exuse (\"My parent/sibling/grandparent is in hospital, I'm so sorry but I have to support them\") or he didn't give any excuse at all. To then just be vague about your future is suspicious at the very least. Are you just a placeholder of sorts until he finds someone he does want to spend the rest of his life with? Or is he perpetually single and does he like his freedom more than you?\n\nDespite the answer, with that and how involved he was with your children I'd be more cautious too, especially concerning the kids. Should you break up sooner or later, it'll be bad enough dealing with your own heartbreak. You can't put your children through that too.\n\nEdit: NTA, of course", "NTA. Dude missed your kid's birthday. Unless it was a dire health emergency, I would bounce. Don't waste your energy trying to convince someone else that you and your kids are worth their time.

Your decision to step back is reasonable but he is not your kids\u2019 father and their father is active in their lives and since you clearly cannot come to him and maintain the custody arrangement, he is the one that is going to have to make all of the sacrifices (new job, etc) to move in with you. If neither of you can compromise and want to end the relationship, it\u2019s totally fair. But I don\u2019t think anyone is T A.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're protecting your children from potential pain. Your children come first, always. He clearly doesn't get that, and you're right to be concerned about his attitude. You're a good mother. Keep doing what's right for you and your family. The right man wouldn't want you to do anything else.", "NTA. \n\nHe's thrown out information you didn't have before.

Maybe it was an unavoidable thing that he couldn\u2019t keep the plans but his response that he questioned whether there was a future in your relationship is not something he should have said lightly where kids are involved.

He\u2019s the only person I\u2019ve dated since their dad.

However then I expressed that I would want us, one day, to be in the same household so we have these times together and what he thought. That\u2019s what led into the whole discussion and made me want to take a step back for the kids aspect", "He just said he was tired from his work week. that\u2019s fine and understandable but it\u2019s just frustrating that he missed an important event and that there\u2019s other events I would love him to be present for but it\u2019s hard and I get it.
