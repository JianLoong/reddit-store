Got match with a girl last week and she directly asked for meeting and I said yes. We decided a common meeting point but when I reached there she was 30 minutes late and later told me its very far so asked me to come over some other place. I obliged and when I reached she was not there and said she is already sitting in a cafe which we have not decided and asked me to come inside the cafe. As soon as I reached inside, she started ordering like crazy - expensive vodka, hookah(even though I said I don\u2019t smoke) and all kind of food. I was not even hungry but she didn\u2019t care to ask. I got a little skeptical as the place was expensive and she kept on ordering more shots. And i don\u2019t want to be the one paying for all that on the first date so I acted as I got a call and I ditched her after 20 minutes. So am i the asshole for ditching the girl? Should I have waited for the whole date and then pay the full bill as a gentlemen?", "created_utc": 1667075622, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ygtz5x/aita_for_ditching_my_date_at_cafe/", "score": 203, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You did nothing wrong.", "NTA - I get the distinct feeling she was scamming you for your money. You did the smart thing.", "NTA\n\nShe pulled a bait and switch on you. She was changing plans in the middle of plans, ordering a whole mess of stuff- she just had you there to pay for her idea of a good time. Paying the bill doesn\u2019t make you a gentleman, it makes you a door mat. Enough guys have thought as you did and paid her way, which is why she felt bold enough to pull that nonsense with you. She was no lady, just so you know. \n\nGood on you for leaving. I wouldn\u2019t waste another second feeling bad.", "NTA. Next thing you know, all her friends show up. More drinks. More food.

I would have given up right then and there, red flags.\n\nShe was clearly just using you & definitely would have expected you to pay. I\u2019m surprised her friends weren\u2019t with with her!", "NTA. She was clearly hoping to use you.", "NTA She was using you for a free night out. Live and learn. If you continue to use on line dating sites, coffee is a good first date.", "NTA. Dude. At least she flew all her red flags \ud83d\udea9 on the first date", "NTA\n\nYep, she wanted you to foot the bill for her to get drunk and have fun.", "Obviously NTA. She was using you for a free meal.", "NTA, also right away: it is Gentleman, not doormatman or atmman.\nBe glad you ditched a bullet and please be careful of something like meeting right away, especially if you are a guy and the girl demands it, it is really suspicious.", "NTA. You had me at \"30 minutes late.\"", "NTA. She was using you. Her behaviour is not okay. Typical dates do not go the way you describe. Yes you left her, hopefully it taught her a lesson about her appalling behaviour. Why should you be on the hook for what was going to be hundreds, because you are a male? These stories make the rounds over social media, occasionally. She tried to take you for a ride, and you refused.\n\nYou are not obligated to pay for your date, and 99% of people/women do not expect you to, especially on a first date. It\u2019s a nice gesture, but not mandatory. (I\u2019m a woman, if it matters.)\n\nMy advice would be, if you try online dating again, would be to invite them out for a coffee only. Insist, gently, on coffee. Believe me, this often is easier on women. It\u2019s more casual, and the expectation of a connection is less. \n\nIf they try to change the location, be wary. It might just be that they prefer a different coffee spot. If they try it on the date itself, and it seems to be leading to your scenario, politely decline. Tell her you ate already, and only have enough cash to treat her for a coffee and pastry. That you weren\u2019t prepared for a lunch or dinner date today. And you we\u2019re thinking, if things go well over coffee, that maybe she\u2019d like to take a walk with you after. Enjoy your surroundings. Have a plan in your pocket for this too. Like a near by park/mall/gallery/museum/etc. Bring cash/leave cards at home. You\u2019ll get a sense of their true intentions through this interaction. \n\nHonestly, most people hear or read coffee date, and prepare for that themselves. Wanting to switch, last minute on the date, is highly suspicious. Unless it\u2019s to another similar coffee/tea shop. Or unforeseen circumstances. Play it by ear. But be cautious. There are a lot of honest people on dating sites, who are looking for a relationship, but there are also a lot of people like the girl in your post too.\n\nA coffee date is perfectly acceptable. And neither you, or your date, is out a lot of cash. This gives you both a chance to check each other out, and see if you connect. If yes, great, go on to do other things. If you connect more as friends than romantically, then that\u2019s something too. Or you don\u2019t connect at all. Then you can both say you gave it a go, and it was worth the experience.\n\nI\u2019ll say it again. NTA.", "Welcome to the weird and wonderful world of online dating! I hate your first experience was so terrible, but I\u2019m glad you listened to your instincts and got out of there AND blocked her. Good on you OP! Couple of tips I hope will help:\n\n1) I agree with most of the comments here where coffee is a good first date choice. Anywhere casual should work. Cafe, mid range restaurant for lunch, low key bar, etc. The key is that the place be public, well lit, not a lot of noise, and you\u2019re able to face each other\n2) When a person insists on meeting right away after matching, tread carefully. Some people who do this are looking to take advantage of others, whether they\u2019re looking for sex, or, in your case, someone to pay for a fun night out. The point of an online dating site/app is to START to get to know one another. Exchange friendly messages, have a quick video chat, just start to communicate with each other. So many people complain and put in their bios about how they loathe messaging back and forth, but that connection is so important. Hell, you may begin to converse and realize you don\u2019t even WANT to meet each other. And that\u2019s okay.\n3) Things happen, but if someone insists on changing the location of a date last minute, ask to reschedule instead. Again, you\u2019re trying to reduce your chances of being taken advantage. If the person is really on the up and up, they\u2019ll oblige. \n4) You don\u2019t owe anyone anything. Leave or cut off a convo if you\u2019re uncomfortable. Block a phone number or a profile if you no longer wish to speak to that person. Don\u2019t be afraid to (tactfully) tell someone you had an unpleasant time. \n5) Have fun! Not everyone you meet will be a winner, as you\u2019ve found out unfortunately. Enjoy the experience for what it is. You\u2019re getting to know new people, hopefully going to new places, and learning more about yourself and what you do or don\u2019t want in a partner.\n\nI hope your next experience is way better. Good luck!", "I think this is an actual scam that I have come across on the Dept of State website. The bill will be astronomical and sometimes the alcohol is drugged, and she is likely working for the cafe. Very smart to leave!", "NTA and you displayed more patience than i would have. \n\n\nKnow your worth and don't be a doormat.", "NTA, I would\u2019ve ended it with the \u201c30 mins late\u201d oh hell nah\u2026", "**NTA**\n\nIn any first meeting scenario, romantic or business, it is important to make a good first impression.  You did so by being at the designated place at the designated time.\n\nShe failed miserably multiple times and in completely inconsiderate ways.\n\nWhile you may feel the need to play the role of a gentleman by staying and paying the tab, she clearly refused to act like a lady and did not deserve to be treated as one.\n\nIf you haven't yet, block her on any medium by which she might contact you (phone, social media, etc.).  If you were connected via an app like Tinder, swipe in a different direction if she ever shows up again as a potential match.", "NTA, and oh, hell no. Marinara flags everywhere that she needed to get plastered while eating expensive food and smoking all while you're protesting BEFORE you ever get to have any conversation with her. That's outright insane.", "NTA. I'm a woman, wouldn't even occur to me to act like that. If I met someone who acted like that, I'd wanna ditch them too. Sounds like an awful date.\n\nI had a couple bad online dates, but I did meet good people too. They're out there.", ">pay the full bill as a gentlemen\n\nPlease let this idea die. \n\nMen and women can decide between them as equals who pays for what and when to share the bill. If you can't discuss this prior to a date then you shouldn't be dating.", "NTA.\n\nAs a woman, I strongly feel that the guy picking up the check is both outdated and sexist.\n\nShe attempted to just outright use you.\n\nGoing forward maybe when you make plans be sure to put in the invitation to go Dutch and each pay for their own meals. \n\nMake it clear.  No one should expect another 1st date to pick up their tab.\n\nNTA!!", "NTA. When I was in grad school a number of my friends went on dates with people they weren\u2019t interested in to get a free meal. At the time I didn\u2019t really see a problem with what they were doing because we were all struggling grad students. I look back on it now and realize how completely unfair and inappropriate that behavior is. Emotional and financial manipulation.", "Nta she was trying to get a free meal out of you bro block her ass you gotta be very careful dating online", "NTA this girl acted sketchy as all hell.
