Vs christian ....christian EXTREMIST ..are hateful homophobes using their religion as an excuse to spread hate but the average Christian who simply holds the religious belief that its wrong because the bible says so , but follows the bibles instruction of judge not lest ye be judged and treats gay people the same as every other person ( as they should) is allowed to have their belief that its wrong ..without being called vile names ....we can be tolerant of one another's beliefs without accepting that belief as our own  .what we should never do  is to spread hate over those differences in belief or insist everyone  MUST agree with our beliefs only .....bottom line tolerance and respect is supposed to be a 2way street .. we need to stop trying to police THOUGHTS and stick to policing actions ...because unfortunately even homophobic racist jack a*# es are entitled to their opinion ..they AREN'T entitled to harm others over it ..\nFootnotes ...before you label me the homophobe .fair warning ..i WILL let my very flamboyantly openly gay son whom i adore quite publicly respond to your comments ..\n2 ..i am not christian but i do believe in God .\n3 .i hold the ( hopelessly naive ) belief that we all hold the power to make the world better  1 kind act at a time ....\n...btw ..i handle trolls by giving them all the attention they deserve ....which is NONE ...starve those vile excuses for humans \nI will respond to anyone who is open to a polite discussion on opposing viewpoints", "Probably would be offended by having the smell of delicious pizza enter their nostrils", "Steak tartare", "Can confirm.
