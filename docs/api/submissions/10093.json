My wife (30F) and I (31M) have been married for about 7 years now. I decided to go on a last minute work trip which caused me to have to book flights, hotel, etc. late at night and then fly out the next day. I needed new work slacks for the trip since I\u2019ve primarily been working from home in my current company, so we had to make a late night run to the local Walmart to get a few pairs. We also got some button up shirts. When we got home I had some stuff to finish up with the planning so I asked my wife to wash my new clothes so that my shirts weren\u2019t so wrinkly. I handed her the shirts to wash separately and put the pants in the dirty laundry. \n\nWhile they washed she packed my suitcase and then added the shirts when they were done. When it came time to leave, I verified everything was packed by asking her if she packed my pants. She said yes.\n\nCue to late the next night when I arrive at my hotel and my slacks aren\u2019t in there\u2014only my brown khakis and gray khakis. I called her pretty upset asking where my slacks were. She got defensive and told me she thought she packed all my clothes (I had laid them out on the bed besides the stuff to be washed) and told me they should be in there. I made her check the laundry room to be sure and she looked around the whole house before finding them in our bedroom laundry basket unwashed. \n\nI repeated a few times how I was frustrated that she hadn\u2019t packed them but had told me that she did. She said she didn\u2019t realize by \u201cpants\u201d I meant my slacks and that she was busy trying to do other stuff and just had a memory of packing some pants with all the other things I had laid out. She also said it was unreasonable for me to be upset with her when they are my pants and she didn\u2019t think she was expected to do a whole second load of laundry at midnight.\n\nIn the end she attempted to make me feel better by saying that it would be okay and my work would understand that sometimes things get a bit hectic with packing and traveling last minute (and I can buy more in the evening hopefully). I feel kind of bad cause I could tell she was frustrated with me for blaming her, but in my defense I did ask her if she had packed everything.\n\nEdit/Update: I accept that IATA and have apologized to my wife. She responded graciously and told me she knows a lot of it was just my stress from traveling and worrying about work. We are good now and I promised to do better in the future. Thanks to everyone who engaged with me civilly in the comments. I showed my wife the post and she wants to say that she is a little surprised at how angry everyone else was (she says she was frustrated but knew it\u2019s not a pattern), especially some individual messages that some very angry people decided to send me.\n\nTL;DR my wife forgot to pack my slacks for a work trip and I was frustrated with her over the phone so we argued.

My wife is like that. We can learn from wonderful, positive people like this!", "They shouldn\u2019t be complaining amongst each other either tbh.", "I have adhd and am the packer and house manager - i am FRIED the day before we go anywhere after packing for everybody. \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8", "I just can't believe that people are out here with full-time servants calling it a marriage. Not sexy.", "I mean there's also the really fun fact of domestic homicide.", "He probably doesn't know his size.", "I'm also confused about the not getting wrinkly excuse because first off, clothes are almost always wrinkly after being folded up in a suitcase. And second, most hotels have irons. Could he not just iron them once he got to the hotel? It seemed like a bs request from jump.", "That will give her something to do till morning!", "I was married to a guy like OP for five years. After he forgot to pack pants / a belt / underwear for the ELEVENTH time and yelled at me for not just packing for him - I work a 70 hour a week corporate job - (among his many other similarly ridiculous childlike behaviors) I divorced him. The bar is in a hole, and OP if out here fighting for his life trying to prove he\u2019s right.", "I learned to do laundry by like age 10. My dad was well accustomed to me being the way I was so he knew there was no way I was doing it for him \ud83d\ude02\n\nWhat baffles me is all 3 of us kids (including my brother) were doing our own laundry and cleaning up after ourselves at a fairly young age. My dad would clean (he had no issue with that) but acted like certain tasks like cooking, shopping and laundry were solely my mom's job. They both worked full time so his logic never made sense to me. My mom put up with it, but luckily instilled in us that that was total b.s.", "Hotels have irons and ironing boards, so they didn't need to be washed because of wrinkles.", "It really makes no sense. If I'm going to have slacks in a suitcase for a work trip, I'm going to be ironing them in the hotel before wearing them. Even if they're dry cleaned and pressed, they're going to be wrinkled from packing and TSA rifling through them. I can't comprehend thinking they'll be in better shape washed, dried, and packed vs brand new and packed.", "Dude could have tossed them in the dryer with a damp wash cloth while the pants were washing. It would have taken the majority,if not all, of the wrinkles out", "Don't forget the partial lobotomy.", "Being a head in a jar ain't easy. But at least he can use his keyeboard to type posts on Reddit.", "This wife has the patience of a SAINT. If I got a phone call about missing the pants & he had hidden things in a basket of dirty laundry, I would LOSE it. I hope this guy knows how lucky he is. I\u2019m not so sure he does.", "My husband used to make his poor planning my emergency all the time. My ex-husband.", "People really need to have Color Catchers on hand at all times for this reason. I ALWAYS put them in with new clothes. They catch all of the stray dye.", "I assume he uses voice to text? All the liquid keeping his head alive might make the voice go all gurgly though", "Probably never once thanked her for helping.", "Yep. Sizing to keep the fabric a little stiffer in the package, plus loose dye that can transfer onto your skin if you didn't give it the chance to transfer onto your whites in the wash.", "And folks can be nasty.  You don\u2019t know who or how many other people have tried on those pants or what their hygiene is like.  Any new clothes automatically gets washed before wearing because I am a slight germaphobe and the whole Covid think hasn\u2019t made it any better.", "Everybody needs to wash new clothes before they wear them\u2026we don\u2019t know the full truth of the conditions they were made or packed in, how/what they were transported with, and how much they were handled/tried on before we bought them.", "I wish more of us would put our foot down.  I'm currently having an ongoing domestic with my other half about the fact he has minimal household tasks but never even does them and then has the absolute Brass Neck to complain to me about the washing up not being done.  He promised, kept it up until we were married and then decided not to anything productive or useful to me ever again.", "I know - I was adding that on top of putting the slacks in the laundry hamper & not telling her they were there, he added more work for her to do by packing his suitcase when he could & should have done that himself", "Have a fam member that used to work at a high-end department store and, even there, some of the stuff they'd find in there was appalling. Hangover puke, half eaten food, wigs. One that really stays with me was finding used tampons on the dressing room floor. Yes, \"tampons\" plural because it happened multiple times. Always wash your new clothes.", "Can confirm, I'm not yet menopausal but take the same sort of medications. Hot flushes are SO much worse than I'd assumed they were before I actually experienced one. If you're already somewhere warm or dressed in layers when one hits it's like instant sweat-city."]}
