Third, lays each item on the bed and checks it off the list. Fourth, packs each item and crosses it off the list. Even with using this system every time, sometimes something is forgotten. Never once in 30+ years has he EVER blamed me for forgetting something. Reason 1 is because he is a grown ass man. Reason 2 is he appreciates any help I give him when he has to get things prepared for time away from us. Reason 3 and most important is he knows better because I will not hesitate to remind him of reason 1!! You need to apologize to your wife. Oh and YTA!!!", "I kept misreading wife as mum. Probably because he sounds like a little kid.", "Came here to write this.\n\nI actually can't find anything wrong at all with your wife's behavior. It played out as well as possible given the conditions you put up for her to help you with your problem. You put the pants out of sight, out of mind, and didn't check for them specifically. Be thankful for all she did for you, and apologize to her.", "[removed]", "Exactly. OP stated he put the slacks in the dirty laundry but nowhere does he say that he asked his wife to also wash them. How was she supposed to know they were separated from the slacks? YTA", "I couldn't finish it either, of course he's the AH. He sounds like a Mama's boy... Maybe mommy will come over next time and make sure it's done right.", "And she did pack pants. Just appearently not the ones he wanted...", "Yeah. He expected her to: \n\nGo \u2018late night\u2019 shopping with him \n\nWash the new shirts \n\nDig through the dirty laundry to then do a second load containing the new pants \n\nWait for all of this to dry? What time is it by now? 1 am? 2 am?\n\nPack his suitcase for him, presumably including Blanky and a note that mommy loves him.", "OP, does your wife normally do things so perfectly that you never double check her? If so, then maybe cut her some slack (no pun intended) for \u201cmessing up\u201d this one time. If not, then this guy has a point.", "\"Allow me to describe how I was an asshole to my wife....\n\n\n...AITA?\"\n\n\n\n-OP", "Oh, but he's busy. Busy-busy-busy!", "Further : If you think your in the right here and all of us are wrong explain this to your work colleagues in the same way you did here. If you dare.  See if they think your shortage of slacks ( wtf are slacks?) Is a \"wife\" problem.", "Giggled at this because I had an ex who did something similar once so this isn't such a far fetched question \ud83e\udd2d\n\n(Also OP YTA of course)", "Uh-uh, and the wife does absolutely nothing apparently \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Recipe for disaster! \ud83d\ude02"]}
