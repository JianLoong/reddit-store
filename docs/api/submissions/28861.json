Did she give you enough information for you to understand the reason for her upset, or did you shut her down with your defensive reaction before she could explain? \n\nIs there, to use your words, an angle to this you are not seeing? - and I ask that question most literally. When they look at the photo of the tattoo on a screen, is there possible a hidden image picture that you have not seen yourself because you didn't consider it part of your design but they are picking up on? \n\nPerhaps you need to give them the opportunity, if they have not already done so, to explain exactly why this particular tattoo is so upsetting to them.", "INFO Your previous tattoos can be hidden under modest clothing and your family doesn't know about the others.

Both my kids have lots of tattoos.\n\nI don't particularly find tattoos attractive, but you know what? My kids have their own aesthetics and their own sovereignty. Personal appearance standards change with each generation, and nobody put me in charge. When my kids show me their newest tattoos, what I relate to is the happiness they feel. I also admire their tattoos as a statement about who they are, and what they care about -- which I'm always glad they're willing to share with me. \n\nAll of which is to say that you sound like a sweet daughter, but you're giving your parents too much leeway here. You get to celebrate your personal choices, and your mom and dad need to get over themselves. Please don't apologize! If you assert your rights to your own body, it will actually help your parents come to terms with your adulthood.", "You absolutely should.

I have a family member who at best is emotionally immature, at worst a narcissist. I use the techniques to manage my interactions with them on that rare occasion I see them. Being VLC has been huge for me and being able to handle them in minuscule doses. \n\nI know it\u2019s hard to get past the manipulation you\u2019ve been dealing with your whole life. One that is so ingrained that you reflexively apologize to prevent someone else from spiraling. But the honest truth is, when you do bend to the emotional manipulation you\u2019re only coddling the person abusing you. If your mom has a mental breakdown, just know it\u2019s because she\u2019s scared she is losing control of you and the ability to manipulate you. Not because you got a tattoo. Or she didn\u2019t like the outfit you wore to see a relative. Or because you\u2019re not following the script she wants you to. \n\nAlso your tattoo sounds awesome. I love animal tattoos so much.", "Thank you, this was a bit of a wake up call for me. I need to think long and hard about how to move forward with her/my feelings"]}
