It can be terrifying to not know if your job is secure.  I have been in the position, and it causes so much stress.  Layoffs are nothing new and they put people in unplanned situations, and if your father has never experienced that stress, then he has no room to lecture you on how you should feel or think.  Keep your head up.  Keep working and do your best to show your value at work.  I do think you should reach out to your dad and ask him to just listen to what you have to say about how he dismissed you.  He does still love you and I believe you still love him.", "So your dads asks you how work is going, you tell him and he proceeds to invalidate and shame you for your feelings.  I think leaving was the best option for you.  \n\nRich that he says you're the one that ruined the weekend.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Walking away was the correct response.", "NTA\n\nI almost went NAH, but some of your fathers cringeworthy comments prevented me from doing so. \n\nMuch of what your father is saying is correct; this has happened before.  I also work in tech but am old enough to remember the recession and the dot.com bubble bursting. Right now we're seeing the inevitable market correction from years of low interest rates creating an endless supply of \"free money\" for VCs and the starts ups they've been funding.   The party is over for many companies that aren't profitable. \n\nThat being said, you're completely justified for feeling the way you do.  Just don't let it impact your performance at work right now.", "NTA, he should apologize", "NTA at all. And frankly, the fact that societies and industries have survived downturns before does not mean that individual people didn't have their lives seriously impacted, so your father isn't even making any sense. \n\nYou have a completely justified concern and deserve to be treated with respect. I hope that other people in your life are able to provide some emotional support right now.", "NTA but your dad does have a point. You can\u2019t let anxiety over layoffs tear you up. At best, lay-offs are out of your control so worrying does nothing productive. At worst, your anxiety will hurt your performance and make you more likely to get laid off. Your dad should have spent more time empathizing with you but you should consider therapy to deal with your work anxiety.", "NTA. Don't contact him for a while. I think you need space. It isn't petty. He ruined the weekend for you first.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

But here\u2019s something to think about: When you\u2019ve been living for as long as our parents have, the adversities and issues we face start to seem rather small to them. They\u2019ve seen/been through most of it, or even worse. I think what he was trying to tell you is that even if you get laid off, you\u2019ll figure it out. You\u2019ll survive. He just said it in the classic dad-way which seems cold hearted. He believes you\u2019ll figure it out. You should too.", "Of course NTA. Your job is hanging on a thread, and you weren't only dismissed, but he even pulled the card that \"women don't know how to work hard.\"\n\nSend your stepmom a message that you will not speak to him, at all, until he apologizes.\n\nAnd start looking for work elsewhere.", "NAH\n\nI know it hurt that your dad dismissed your concerns.  However, what he said was factually correct and not intentionally cruel.  There absolutely have been downturns before and will be again.   None of that makes it any emotionally easier to handle if you're laid off.  You do the best you can and circumstances outside your control lose you your job.\n\nI'm going to guess he's a more traditional man.  Such men view any expression of fear, sadness, etc. as \"weak.\" And they react by reverting to repressing those feelings and trying to use strict logic instead.    They tend to focus on \"solve the problem\" not \"deal with feelings.\"  From that perspective, anxiety doesn't solve the problem, so they underplay the feelings to focus on the problem.\n\nFrom his POV, that's what he was doing.  He didn't **intend** to hurt you.  I'm certain he's been laid off and, it really sucks.  I've been laid off and, yeah, it really sucks.  \n\nI'd advise reading The Four Agreements, The Power of Now or The Untethered Soul.  All of these are useful self help books that can help you learn the **very hard** lesson of accepting things you cannot change.  I'm 51 and it's still challenging to me.", "NTA. I am also a product manager in tech and can understand your concern, but the best way to combat that is to make yourself an invaluable part of the team by always doing your best work and being someone others can count on. Make connections with people on other teams and look for stretch projects that can highlight your skills to leadership. \n\nI was on the fence of saying NAH because much of what your dad said is true, but he was harsh in his wording and it isn't what you needed or wanted at that time.", "Based on your age I assume your dad is close to my age. He\u2019s forgotten what it\u2019s like to be new in a career, at his age he\u2019s probably jaded. He is being a jerk about it. \n\nKeep this in mind, if the worst did happen, you are early enough in your career to find another job that pays similarly within a short period of time. Your skills are valued and remote work opens up more possibilities to work for companies all over. Do your job to the best of you abilities and try not to let your concerns affect your mental health.", "Unpopular opinion but ESH.  He may not have worded it well but he had some good points.  And just feeding in to your panic would be of no help.", "YTA.  You\u2019re dad was trying to give you a positive outlook and you became a drama Queen.  How do you expect to hack it in your job if you can\u2019t toughen up your skin.  That\u2019s family trying to lift you up.  He wanted you to see that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  \n\nDad\u2019s can sound insensitive at times, but they mean well.  He didn\u2019t put you down.  He didn\u2019t tell you to get another job.  If anything he was trying to make you feel better.  \n\nWho do you think is going to help you if and when you get laid off.  It\u2019s gonna be dad to the rescue.  He will be there encouraging you that it\u2019s not the end of the world.  He\u2019ll tell you to just keep looking for a job while you get your footing.", "NTA. Your feelings are your own.", "NTA My husband's company laid off 25% of the workforce straight after furlough and he had to tell quite a few of his team himself. He ended up on anti depressants for a while and saw a therapist to deal with it, because it was so incredibly stressful and he is in his late 50's, so we get it completely. Some of those laid off had just lost family to the pandemic too. I don't agree with others saying oh, he's older so he's blas\u00e9 about it. He could of empathised with you, not dismissed you. He seems quite misogynistic with his women worry too much etc. I wonder if he would of reacted the same if he was talking to a son dealing with lay offs. It is always okay to leave rather than escalate.", "So first off - you're both right.  You're right to worry about layoffs, and he's right that downturns happen and the industry bounces back fast (faster than just about any other, because the world IS tech) than most.  Depending on where you live, especially, being female makes it easier to get in / harder to lay off based on diversity requirements (no judgement on those, it just is what it is).  BUT...  \n\nThat being said...\n\nNTA.  You're totally allowed to be freaked out about it.  I've been at times - even though I know I won't have a problem getting a job.  Your dad jumped to the \"fix it\" vs the \"listen to it\" stage of the discussion, which...  people do, and it sucks.  He's totally wrong to say it like that.  I'm sorry.  Hang in there, and make sure you talk to your network - folks are always keeping eyes and ears open if something DOES happen!", "NTA", "NTA.   Let the situation cool down and then work on a recovery with him.\n\nI worked in tech for 20+ years and the key to survival is to NEVER forget a few things  (1) Tech companies are all about low cost of producing their service/products.  So figure out how to plug into that and you'll be around a long time.  (2)  Tech companies are about doing things cheaper and better.   The company I worked for was all about offshoring service folks who were less expensive that workers in the US.  But I learned a few things that helped.    Problem solving--a lot of folks offshore went to schools that taught rote learning.   People who learn that way have a hard time applying what they've learned.  Yes there are exceptions, but most couldn't problem solve if their lives depended on it.  They knew facts, but had a hard time applying it when we had issues to solve.  (3)  Creativity in designing solutions---do it cheaper and smarter.", "NTA. There\u2019s no doubt his initial response was wrong, and although he may have not intended for it to come across that way, it still made you upset and that is all that needs to be said. The best you can do is try to make peace with yourself and know that everything you are feeling with your work and your dad are valid and if he wants to make things right that\u2019s for him to worry about not you.", "\"Women overworry so much\" is just a glimpse of what he said to OP. That is an outright putdown no matter how you want to spin it. If he can't be comforting then he could try keeping his sexist mouth shut. OP is NTA for being upset and leaving.", "So, you just learned that your dad is condescending and misogynistic. \n\nNTA.", "yooo that was clean asf", "NTA.   Like the way he called cause he was worried then berated you.  The man is clueless.", "This. Dad was trying to calm her worries in a poor, awkward way. Men of a certain age want to think they can fix things. Explain it to him.  Maybe he needs lessons from her stepmother.", "NAH. your feelings are valid and the thought of being laid off is scary.\n\nYour dad is lacking in tact, but it sounds like he heard you, and did what dad's often do, which is try to practically address the problem.\n\nHe's right. This happens and for many it ends up fine. But not always. Even still, there's nothing you can do, other than continue to give your best in your current role. If the pandemic taught us anything it should be that no job is safe. It doesn't matter how high your sales are or how perfect your attendance or how many extra hours you put in: sometimes shit just happens. \n\nYou're not wrong for thinking about the uncontrollable future and feeling anxiety about what might lie ahead, and he's not wrong for suggesting you not dwell on that.\n\nAnd i imagine this will be an unpopular opinion because the dad did say some pretty asinine things, but again... He's not wrong, just uncouth. ok", "NTA, and walking away was fine.  Your dad was trying to help, I think, but is simply clueless about how to do that.  You can't retrain someone on how to be supportive while you're in the middle of an anxiety attack.\n\nSpeaking as a 63-year-old woman who was an engineer and engineering manager for two decades before I retrained for a different field, tech does indeed have ups and downs.  The downs are hella uncomfortable.  I worked in computer graphics, during a time when that field was contracting sharply, and was laid off four times, always in groups of thirty to sixty people, when my employer shut down the graphics group.  I got tired of being laid off, Husband is a firmware engineer in telecom and never had my job issues, we don't have kids, so he paid for me to go back to school while I was caring for an elderly parent.  Yes, I was privileged.\n\nOP, I encourage you to take as much control of your professional life as possible.  Update that resum\u00e9 every 6 months to a year.  Take university extension classes, or something equivalent that might be available to you, so that you're on top of new tech.  Stay in contact with friends in other tech companies.  So that when you are laid off (inevitable sometime in your career) you can quickly make a plan for where you want to apply next, and what you want to do next.  It is also okay to see the writing on the wall and jump ship when something better comes along.  Taking these steps to be in control will help the anxiety tremendously.\n\nAlso, if you're a religious believer, trust God.  If you aren't, trust serendipity.  Good opportunities will come along.", "NTA but if I may give my perspective. I recently had a situation where my SO was looking for emotional validation and I failed spectacularly at providing it.\n\nI didn't know what I had to apologize for until she told me how she felt about how I handled the conversation. He may legitimately have no idea why you're upset. And if you don't know what you did, you don't know what to apologize for.", "NTA\n\nYour dad obviously didn't understand you wanted sympathy.  Instead, he decided to argue with your feelings, to take away your anxieties.\n\nHe could have done that in somewhat of a compassionate way.\n\nBut with you leaving in tears, he should now know he hurt you and should apologize.  He's not doing that either.", "NTA no, he ruined the weekend you all were supposed to have together with his callous and superior attitude.", "NTA. \n\nHis misogynist sexist talk has to stop.", "I\u2019ve been through a number of lay-off cycles in my career - surviving some, getting laid off in others.  My guiding attitude in those times was to always keep it in perspective.  That is, a job loss can present some hardship, but consider getting news of having cancer instead.  The actual importance of the job is nothing compared to REAL life changing events.", "He's an a h for making it about her being a woman. He'd get sent to HR if he said that at Amazon.", "I\u2019m in the middle of the male generations that wants to fix everything but also let things work out on their own."]}
