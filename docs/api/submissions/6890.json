That was your money not hers.", "NTA- not even close lol", "NTA\n\nSo they uninvite your from the wedding but believed they were still entitled to the cake you had paid for. They are all ridiculous if they think that is normal.", "NTA. Amazing that they thought that you'd still pay for a cake after being kicked out of the whole wedding, how entitled can they be. Even if the cake was to be a gift, you don't expect gifts from people you excluded from your wedding.

First, I've never heard of a MOH being responsible for the wedding cake - was that an agreement in lieu of a gift or something?

Letting the order stand and being paid back later is nice in theory, but considering there was just a major fallout here I think it\u2019s fair to assume there wasn\u2019t going to be an amicable return of costs to you. You were no longer responsible for wedding gifts or procedures since you were no longer involved in the wedding, and you gave them a heads up. It was their responsibility from that point forward.

I can get her trying to stay friends with someone who has fallen out with her sibling. Their relationship is obviously separate to yours BUT she needs to not involve herself in things like this cake issue otherwise it becomes very much that she is not able to remain impartial and is siding with the friend. Your sister also needs to think about how your relationship with ex best friend ended and seriously consider the fact that her relationship with her may very well head in the same direction.", "Yeah you totally should\u2019ve paid for a cake as a gift for a wedding that you were uninvited to and aren\u2019t allowed to attend makes total sense. \n\nNTA \n\nYour sister is wrong if she thinks you would\u2019ve been able to get that money back. If they uninvited their maid of honor which is already a rude move. Basically an eff you kinda thing then who honestly thinks they would have refunded the money for the cake. Yes the day is special and supposed to be about them but you don\u2019t treat people like shit because of it. Sounds like a super entitled couple that gets off on power trips.", "NTA - They wanted you to keep the order so you'd be forced to pay for it.

Good job on not being a doormat for people who were treating you poorly.", "NTA. \n\nYou maybe could have communicated better but I don't think \"I'm not invited so I'm not buying a cake\" is some extreme unbelievable stance. Bride should have prepared for and expected any investment on your part to be revoked, assuming anything else is dumb IMO. \n\nIt's like \"Oh you're not allowed to come on vacation with me but you still owe me for half the trip.\" To hell with that.", "Would have been boss to keep the cake all for yourself, have a photo shoot smashing it ... perhaps I go too far.", "NTA. Even if they consider the cake a gift, gifts come from wedding guests. No guest, no gift.", "NTA. It seems like almost everyone just goes batshit crazy when a wedding is being planned. But I don't blame you for not providing a cake free of charge when she uninvited you from the wedding.", "NTA, you also informed them prior of the cancellation of the cake.

OP is not the AH, and anyone saying she is an AH is weird.", "NTA ..I have never known a guest, much less an uninvited one to be expected to order and pay for a cake for a wedding. It is their party.

OP proposed a cake and then decided not to give it after the bride broke up with her, despite the bride then demanding OP still give her the cake. *There never was a cake, just the promise of one.*\n\nThis entitlement takes...the cake. /ducks head/\n\nNTA.", "The idea of even one rehearsal is funny to me, though. What\u2019s the point? (I\u2019m not from the US)", "I would describe it more as egocentric.", "At least for the guy's side of things. I think every wedding I've been to, the bridesmaids all ended up having to buy their dresses. Heck, I think one of the ones I was in, I already owned everything but the specific color shirt they wanted the guys to wear.  I already had the suit. They all kept asking why mine fit so much better than theirs lol", "Well, that's not the impression I get from Reddit. From what I read here, being best man/maid of honor is pretty much an unpaid job.", "And here I thought mayo for icing was bad...", "Same.\n\nAlso I've had some shit happen in my life that no one would believe was real if I posted it on reddit - so I tend to assume most of the stories told here are real.", "$300 for a dress?!?  That is insane.  I was only in one wedding (20 years ago) and I thought the $150 dress was a lot!   Thankfully I did get a couple of uses out if it.  I only had two girls in my wedding. My sister and my SIL. I told them to get a dress they liked as long as it was blue.  \nI have never really liked the cookie cutter bridesmaid look. One style dress does not work for everyone", "\u201cWedding Rehearsal\u201d seems to be something that is a cultural phenomenon? \n\nIn Australia I have never heard of such a thing, but it\u2019s bemusing to see rom-coms from the USA feature such events\u2026 and all the large dinner-party, extra room booking, etc, etc, involved.", "Dang, you were super chill about this even in a situation where it would have been reasonable to be losing your chill. You're like whatever balances out bridezillas in the world.", "It\u2019s from cost rising. Good for me, I only want like 3 bridesmaids, 4 max, so paying for dress soundly bankrupt me (especially because I wouldn\u2019t be spending over $100 for those dresses), but I can understand if you have a big wedding party", "I paid for the bridesmaids everything (and groomsmen even though they did nothing, but that\u2019s a whole other thing) and I got married 5 years ago!", "That sounds amazing! \u2764\ufe0f", "Right? I rather spend the money for a down-payment on a house.", "I'm from the midwest in the USA.   I've heard of them, but they seem dumb to me.", "That is just nuts!  My wedding dress was under $700 (16 years ago)", "It was. About a $1000 bucks, and it was *beautiful*. \u201cRegular\u201d people that spend 10-20 *thousand* plus are absolutely nuts. \n\nBut I mean, it\u2019s their life, I don\u2019t condemn them, just think it\u2019s such a waste. And the *stress*?! Nah, glad both myself and my wife are anti-stress and anti-drama.", "my ex husband and i tried to make our wedding this stress free. we had about 50 guests as well (he has a huge family tho, any less would have been excluding immediate family or very close friends). i bought my wedding dress off the rack for about $100. no wedding party. we had a few dishes and the cake catered and my best friend arranged the rest (she was a banquet chef then). it was an outside wedding at my parents\u2019 camp. from what i could tell everyone had a blast and many said it was the best wedding they\u2019d been to.", "I'm hoping my daughter's friend isn't going to go all bridezilla, she's a sweet girl, but I can see the storm clouds coming, lol.", "\ud83d\ude02 Oh no, it happens to the best of them. \ud83d\ude48"]}
