That was your money not hers.", "NTA- not even close lol", "NTA\n\nSo they uninvite your from the wedding but believed they were still entitled to the cake you had paid for. They are all ridiculous if they think that is normal.", "NTA. Amazing that they thought that you'd still pay for a cake after being kicked out of the whole wedding, how entitled can they be.

First, I've never heard of a MOH being responsible for the wedding cake - was that an agreement in lieu of a gift or something?

Letting the order stand and being paid back later is nice in theory, but considering there was just a major fallout here I think it\u2019s fair to assume there wasn\u2019t going to be a amicable return of costs to you. You were not longer responsible for wedding gifts or procedures since you were no longer involved in the wedding, and you gave them a heads up. It was their responsibility now.

I can get her trying to stay friends with someone who has fallen out with her sibling. Their relationship is obviously separate to yours BUT she needs to not involve herself in things like this cake issue otherwise it becomes very much that she is not able to remain impartial and is siding with the friend. Your sister also needs to think about how your relationship with ex best friend ended and seriously consider the fact that her relationship with her may very well head in the same direction.", "Yeah you totally should\u2019ve paid for a cake as a gift for a wedding that you were uninvited to and aren\u2019t allowed to attend makes total sense. \n\nNTA \n\nYour sister is wrong if she thinks you would\u2019ve been able to get that money back. If they uninvited their maid of honor which is already a rude move. Basically an eff you kinda thing then who honestly thinks they would have refunded the money for the cake.

Even if they consider the cake a gift, gifts come from wedding guests. No guest, no gift.", "NTA. It seems like almost everyone just goes batshit crazy when a wedding is being planned.

NTA.", "Yeah but she wouldn't be reimbursed since the bride says \"gifts cannot be returned\".\n\n\nShe just didn't give her a gift, which is normal once you get uninvited to a wedding", "Ooh gosh, I think I had some of the cake too!", "I would be crazy to still expect a gift(cake included) from someone I uninvited. I'd also be stressed if I lack common sense lol.", "Thanks for the info - I think you're off the hook.  It's crazy to uninvite someone (always awkward, never fun) and still expect them to shell out cash on a party they aren't attending.", "OP says she told them about the cancellation 2 days prior, I was talking about that. (That if it was me I wouldn't bother at all).", "NTA  I think the bridezilla sent someone anybody even though she knew there was no cake, so they could drag you when it wasn't there, AKA to make you look bad and to cause drama because that's probably her middle name.", "At that point, it's on the bride to make sure the cake is still ordered", "You cancelled a wedding cake two days before the wedding and still got a refund? Someone's lying.", "Were you clear with them that the cake had been cancelled? Or just that you, personally, would not bring it? It\u2019s not clear from your post vs this comment", "So long as you reassured her you wouldn't leave her actual wedding then I don't see why you were uninvited originally. People have got to work, especially when you're on call and I can't grasp how the bride couldn't understand that. NTA.", "I'm not sure why you agreed to be MOH if you have such an intense job.\n\nAlso don't know why you didn't just tell her the cake was cancelled.", "I am clearly missing something here. If someone gets uninvited to something and there is clearly drama, regardless of who is at fault, why would anyone think they are still bringing or paying for something at that event? This is not a you are wrong, it\u2019s a I don\u2019t understand. If I was dropping people I\u2019d invited I wouldn\u2019t expect them to keep buying and bringing things.", "Yes, OP did the right thing cancelling the cake. But don't you think she should have been less cryptic about telling them?", "At the very least OP should have explicitly told them that the cake was/being cancelled. The ambiguity led to OP being a petty ah.", "As I've stated above: \n\nAt the very least OP should have explicitly told them that the cake was/being cancelled. The ambiguity led to OP being a petty ah.", "I didn't say she shouldn't have cancelled the cake\n\nShe should've mentioned she cancelled the cake.", "How are you people not getting that OP did not tell them their wedding cake order had been canceled?", "OP told the bride that they were not going to pick up the cake, NOT that they were canceling it. This prevented the bride from being able to get an equal replacement", "She only expected the cake, because no one told her the cake order was cancelled. If OP had let the bride know \u201cI\u2019m cancelling the cake\u201d she would be N.T.A.", "I don't know why brides think they are more important than everything in anyone else's life.   Planning meetings can be done through email and text. Honestly the bride sounds several levels of entitled.", "I'm a comment, OP clarified that she said \"Don't expect me to supply you with a cake.\" That should make it obvious that OP wasn't going to pay for it, and if the bride still wanted it then she should immediately call the bakery and change the payment.", "Seems to me that would be their problem, not OPs.  If I uninvited someone from a party.  I don\u2019t expect them to bring/pay for stuff, because they are \u2026. uninvited.  DUN DUN DUNNNNNnnnnn.  Sorry for the dramatic effect.", "And the bride didn\u2019t take that opportunity to, I don\u2019t know, call the bakery? Talk to the uninvited bridesmaid and offer to pay for the cake? But no\u2026", "Of course, I\u2019d never expect OP to pay for the cake and that\u2019s that I would have assumed had she not said anything. However, OP deliberately said that she \u201cwasn\u2019t going to bring the cake over to them\u201d which more than implies that that cake was still going to be made"]}
