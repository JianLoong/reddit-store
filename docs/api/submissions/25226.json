Who cares if the whirlpool is jeartshaped when you can spend a nice time with your wife in said whirlpool? \n\nYou told her to choose and then ridiculed her for it. Yeah I think themed rooms are awful too, but she tried to make up for Dubai. She was trying to make it special and you didn't let her down softly you laughed at her.

I guess it depends when they met.", "So I just need to wait a decade for you to stop infantilizing my wife?\n\nI told her to pick but I didn't know a hotel closed for murders and health violations were on the table!", "Agreed, I absolutely LOVE campy kitschy things and a themed hotel would be my dream. This place seems so fun. If you haven\u2019t already, check out the Instagram account aprettycoolhoteltour. They go to all kinds of fun places like this.", "Couldn\u2019t agree more! \n\nOP is definitely NTA.

Did I miss it?\n\n I heard some news about Roe v. Wade, was it written into the constitution or something? When was the last time a day passed without a bunch of kids dying from gunshot wounds here?", "Well, uh, they would have been ripped off as the hotel is bow shut down due to safety and health issues.\nBut yeah, he's the AH", "Her: \"Let's go to the tacky hotel that's been shut down for so many health code violations they want it torn down.\"", "You're right, I didn't have to shit all over it. Somebody else already did. It's probably one of the reasons it was shut down.", "I was going to mention the human rights issues in my comment and you are totally right. The inhumane use of foreign labour in building is also appalling.  Big reason why I've no desire to go there.", "And OMGosh this news article, it also says how the building is in horrendous condition.  \n\nNothing is like the way it was when they were here,\" Chasity Burris, the hotel's operations manager, said. \"And we don't know what to do. We have a lot of residents who live here. Everybody's basically gonna be deemed homeless tonight and we have families here that have children!\"", "I think she knew I would be shocked by this place and it was to insult me about my inability to afford Dubai.\n\nThis way I'm the villain when I refuse.

He told her she could have whatever she wanted and then he reneged because he thought it was ugly. Now he's using the fact that it happened to have crime and health problems as a way of covering it up. OP didn't know it was unclean before he said no, he refused to book because it was ugly.\n\nHe isn't an asshole because he knew he wouldn't enjoy it, he's an asshole because he promised her she could book any hotel she wanted, then he laughed in her face and refused to book it. OP handled it like an asshole. He could've suggested they look for a different Arabian Nights style themed room, if that was what she wanted, but instead he was outright rude to her when she did nothing except what he literally told her she could do.", "Oh man I\u2019m so with you I love kitch and tacky, I\u2019d love this place", "Omg the flying saucer bed", "Wow. I googled it. Haha. 161 police visits by Oct 22 and shutdown after the manager OD\u2019d on site.", "No, it\u2019s been shut down. So you\u2019re off the hook.

Why would she pick it if she didn't want to go?", "Trapped you?  In what way?", "Wtf", "Probably not a good sign their website says copyright 2011.

You didn\u2019t start saying you were concerned with safety and health code violations. You just didn\u2019t like the way it was decorated. Now you\u2019re super excited because you can shift your reasons to something else. \n\nAnd no, they weren\u2019t saying you need to wait a decade. They\u2019re saying that having such a large age gap combined with the younger person being in their early 20\u2019s (at best) when you got together can indicate a partner who wants to control things. Like how you told your wife she could pick anywhere in the state within a reasonable budget and then refused to book a place she was excited about because you didn\u2019t like the decor.", ">\nI told her to pick\n\nExactly. You told her to pick, if you didn't want a themed hotel you should have given a bit more input. If you didn't know your wife would like that type of thing, maybe you don't know each other as well as you should?. But basically, when you tell someone to pick, you can't get upset with what they pick.", "Touched a nerve?", "It\u2019s ok, 1 year in and you showed her you are a little baby, good luck with your marriage lol.", "It doesnt matter. If my spouse wanted to sleep at a dump id bring a tent and we could light a barrel fire or something. If its what makes him happy id be down. You sound like you dont care at all what she likes.", "Some classic DARVO shit right here. You haven\u2019t gotten the response you wanted here so now, instead of you not liking the place and her being upset being the issue, it\u2019s now that she was being manipulative and trying to call you cheap.", "Yeah I agree that she should pay but for me the problem is that he doesn't seem to care and just posted to judge his wife publicly.", "Well, this or the real thing. Your young bride wants dubai, so give her dubai.", "This is such a cope. You did not know anything about the sanitation problems *before* you laughed at her and refused to book it. You said it yourself in your post, you refused to book it because it looked tacky:\n\n>to my horror she showed me pictures of the tackiest room I've ever seen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The room is hideous! And I thought she was joking, but when I laughed she got upset and I had to refuse to book it.\n\nYou didn't refuse because it looked dirty, you refused because you thought it was ugly. The fact that it *also* happened to be a health hazard doesn't excuse your initial behaviour. You promised your wife an anniversary trip to a hotel of *her* choosing, and when she showed you what she wanted you were snobby and rude, and outright refused to go. That's an asshole move.\n\nYou could've told her that you liked the idea of a desert/Arabian-style themed room since you couldn't go to Dubai, but that you'd prefer something that was a little more upscale. You could have looked at themed hotels together to find something you both thought was nice, but instead you laughed in her face and rejected it totally.", "yeah OP is def NTA.", "Hahaha - you\u2019re absolutely right. It\u2019s quite the self-own crapping on the taste of the person that picked him!", "This is the perfect comment ever ever.   \n\n\n(Also, YTA OP, first of all; role with things. If you're going to be stuck up it will absolutely ruin your whole life in general because nothing will always go exactly the way you planned. Learn to roll with things. Also, don't tell someone 'its fully your pick' when you don't accept said picks. That is mean, and teaches people not to trust you at all. Especially your partner. I don't want to jump on the 'the age difference is too big' bandwagon because I don't really believe in that, but I AM happy that your partner has some extra time to find someone who will appreciate her choices.)", "That's the thing, I offered to increase the budget but she wants this place specifically.

There can be more than one sensible option. The person I was at 25 and influenced by my much older husband and without the life experience that I got later, made decisions that I wouldn\u2019t at 36.\n\nI divorced him at 30 and only after that did I realise how creepy it was that he came after me when I was 18 and he was 30\u2026 and it took me 12 long years of marriage to work up to being a functioning and independent enough of an adult to get out from under him. \n\nI still don\u2019t think I actually grew up fully until my mid-thirties.
