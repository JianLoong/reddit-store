I have met his family and everyone loves me except his mother. We had resently moved into an apartment together and one day Mike expressed how he wanted to have a baby. We later found out that he isn't able to and he didn't want to tell his family. So we planned to adopt in the future. One night we where having dinner with his parents , sister and her husband we were all talking and some how grand kids got brought up. His sister was on her 4th baby and asked us when we're we planning to have kids. I said that we are going to adopt when are stable enough to have kids. His mother had gotten upset and said that she wanted a \"real grand child\" but that might be a good idea because the baby won't have my weight. I turned to look at Mike but he acted as if he didn't hear anything and kept eating. His father tried to change the subject but his mother interrupted him and asked me why didn't I want to have a baby of my own. She said \"it's not like you are not used to a little extra fat\" She started to laugh but no one else laughed. I cleared my throat and told her that Mike wasn't able to have kids and that she shouldn't be so quick to talk about someone's else decisions. Mike broke his silence and asked me to leave. I was confused because he just let her sit here and disrespect me now he wants to say something. He hasn't been home in a week. w\nWhen I told my friends what happened they told me that I should have never put his business out there like that.

In their case, those people were married.

Sure it\u2019s not your business to air out his medical issues but what were you supposed to do?! His mom was thinking it\u2019s your fault and he just let her talk to you like that. NTA", "NTA. Your bf was willing to let you take all the heat for something he should have shut down. He\u2019s a coward and your MiL is a nightmare.", "Who talks to 20/21 yo\u2019s about having a baby? Like yikes!", "NTA.  This is a red flag, his mother felt so comfortable disrespecting you. Calling you fat. That weak sauces man didn\u2019t defend you. Let\u2019s her blame you. If your relationship is over you are better off. Weak sauces is a mamma boy and is destined to a horrible partner.", "NTA\n\nIf he was going to try to let that conversation run its course, he can only have expected you to deflect things back to him. His mother sounds like a piece of work.", "NTA. Mike is a coward for not defending you when she disrespected you like that.", "NTA based on I feel his cowardice put you in a position where you had to defend yourself, and you chose to tell the truth. A lot of comments make it out that you acted out of spite, I didn\u2019t see that. If you had you wouldn\u2019t be so shocked about your boyfriends response, which btw is more cowardice. She seems over bearing and very closed minded, he\u2019s obviously got some boundaries issues in regards to her and you are stuck in the middle of that dynamic having to fend for yourself. I probably would have reacted the same, good luck.", "NTA.

He could have told his mom that the choice was yours as a couple. He could have told her that it wasn't any of her business.  \n\nInstead he let *you* take the blame.

What's good for the goose is good for the gander. \n\nBut let's be real. His mom is a piece of work and your bf is a coward who's happy to throw you to the wolves. He also gets mad at you and disappears when you defend yourself from his mom. \n\nYou're only 20 and have only been with this guy a year. Is this really what you want to deal with the rest of your life? Girl just walk away. Just because you spent a lot of time and effort making a mistake, that doesn't mean you have to keep making the mistake.

He should have at least tried to shut her up as his father tried.  I am not sure why all the secrecy, but it was his to protect as well and simply pretending this conversation wasn't happening is what threw you under the bus.  Maybe it's time he accepted whatever decision he made or the situation that created his infertility and stopped expecting to hide behind you.  You felt anything but supported during her interrogation and ugly comments and he CHOSE to let it happen.", "Nta, but you have a boyfriend problem.

You deserve better than Mike. It\u2019s absolutely disgusting that he let his family go off on you about your weight and your lack of kids. He has no balls to stand up to them, and when it became about him he kicked you out. Honestly honey find someone who respects and loves you, and even better who\u2019s mom is not an antagonizing asshole.", "NTA - the moment he let his mother berate you repeatedly for something that was his (fault is the wrong word...problem? Ailment?) ~~Issue~~ condition was the moment he lost the right to have you protect his secret. \n\nIf he doesn't want his family to know, then he doesn't have to tell them, but he absolutely needs to be the one shutting his mother down. \n\nHis desire to keep his medical information secret ends when he lets you take all the abuse for it.", "NTA. You were being disrespected and you defended yourself as you should. Your boyfriend should have stood up for you then it probably wouldn\u2019t have escalated.

I usually don\u2019t like to jump the gun but his mother is straight up calling you fat repeatedly and he doesn\u2019t shoot that shit down ASAP?

Girl if you don\u2019t dump him, you\u2019d be an AH to yourself. This guy not only saw you being humiliated by his mother and did nothing, but had the audacity to get mad at you when the conversation shifted to him? Please do yourself a favour and kick him out. You deserve wayyyyyy better than him for a partner and his mom for a MIL.", "NTA\n\nAnd you need to leave Mike.  He tossed you under the giant bus that is his mother.  He doesn't care about you - only saving himself.", "ESH\n\nYourself for disclosing medical information that you were trusted with.\n\nMike's mother for being a disgusting harpy.\n\nMike for not defending you from his disgusting mother's disgusting comments.

You to a lesser degree than Mike and his Mum. I think you might be better off without Mike. If he can keep quiet while his mother takes cheap shots at you and only speak up when his personal info comes out, then he's never going to stand up for you. Even if you reconcile, have a good hard think about whether you want to put up with this crap for the rest of your life or a signficant portion of it anyways. \n\nYou shouldn't have disclosed his personal medical information of a sensitive nature, infront of his family but in this case I feel for you.

Your boyfriend should have stood up for you. Don't marry a Mama's boy that ditches you for a week because you stated facts to shut his mom up when he wouldn't. Evidently, he doesn't value you.", "kind of a ESH situation. Mike should have defended you when his mother attacked you. However, since he wasn't ready to share the news of his infertility, answering something like \"oh we're not sure yet, maybe in a year or two\" would be a better answer than \"looking to adopt when more stable\". \n\nUrg, disrespecting you like that is so mean though, I know my husband would standup for me if his mother said something like that to me.", "Look, you knew Mike didn't want to tell his family what is essentially medical information. So that's your bad. \n\nBut there's enough bad behavior going on here with his mother picking on you and Mike's utter cowardice, you just can't take all the blame.\n\nESH.\n\nAnd now you know some things you might not have seen before. Mike is a spineless child. He hasn't been home in a week? Good luck working out future conflicts with him.\n\nHis  mother is a judgmental B who will, with the help of Mike's sister, stick her nose into your business. Mike is well aware of what kind of person she is and has not grown up enough to stand up to her. He's clearly not planning on changing that any time soon.\n\nDo you want this for the rest of your life? If not, you're going to have to find better ways of dealing with this bunch. Learning to deflect nosy questions would be a start.", "NTA\n\nAnd you want to build a future with this guy? Really?", "ESH. And so much so, do not bring a child into this disaster. His parents are toxic, he should have said something to support you, and you broke a serious confidence. Not the worse thing on Reddit, but it's giving me the willies.", "ESH but life\u2019s too short to be with a man who doesn\u2019t respect you.", "ESH, but I'd say him more than you. I understand why you didn't just want to sit there and take more abuse for something that is totally out of your control while your boyfriend just sits idly by and lets it happen, but at the same time he clearly wasn't ready to share that information and that's kind of a big one. The play would've been to get out of it as gracefully as possible, and then the second they're gone turn to him and say \"we need to figure out how to proceed with this because I'm not dealing with that again, either you need to tell them or we need to come up with a better lie in the interim.\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You should have probably went with a \u201cwe\u2019ll discuss it more when we\u2019re financially stable.\u201d \n\n\nThere are a lot of options. Some couples opt for sperm donation so you could have ended up pregnant if you both wanted to go that route. Some people really don\u2019t want their families to know so for example some women opt for egg donation and some opt for sperm donation depending on the cause\n\n\nI\u2019m kinda amused about wanting to have kids before getting married. Having a kid with a partner ties you to that partner for the life of the kid. Having a kid and breaking up can limit how far you can move, job schedules, etc. Not to mention you won\u2019t be the dad\u2019s next of kin unless you have filled out POA paperwork in case of a medical emergency. Think about it, he ends up in a bad car crash and family can kick you out. \n\n\nIt\u2019s the same for people who also want to buy a house while dating.\n\n\n(Coparenting from the get go and being a single person choosing to have a kid is different as there is no premise of a romantic relationship in planning the life)\n\n\nThey\u2019re shitty too and it sounds like no one is mature enough to have kids in the scenario", "YTA.

Their first step, tooth, word, day at school, being to tooth fairy. The skinned knees, broken rules, temper tantrums. Real parenthood embraces all the easy and the hard behaviors of raising a child. Who donated the sperm, the ova or the womb the child came from is irrelevant, this confers parentage, not parenthood.\n\n\"She said \"it's not like you are not used to a little extra fat\"\"\n\nIs this the mother-in-law you want?

This information should have been shared by Mike at the time of his choosing. You overstepped your bounds. He was understandably angry and embarrassed and he told you to leave, which again is concerning because he is not defending you. He has been absent for a week over a revelation that would have come out eventually, I suspect.

How was that the way to play this.  Clearly Mike's mother is fishing for information here, clearly he doesn't discuss this with her and clearly she is trying to bait you into giving up information he isn't comfortable with.  It is time to STFU or give a vague answer, at the very least let Mike answer to his parents and family.\n\n>that might be a good idea because the baby won't have my weight. I turned to look at Mike but he acted as if he didn't hear anything and kept eating. \n\nThat was extremely rude of her, it also isn't OK for Mike to let that go without challenge.  In your shoes I'd be refusing to attend family events with such an AH MIL and I'd be telling Mike that the relationship is doomed if he doesn't sort her out.  All that said, she is responding that way precisely because you've just told her she isn't getting grandkids after she has specifically asked about them.\n\n>His father tried to change the subject but his mother interrupted him and asked me why didn't I want to have a baby of my own. \n\nRight, so the mother is assuming since you decided to answer that it is your decision and her boy is just along for the ride.

She is wrong of course, but this is what happens when you decide to speak up instead of Mike.\n\n>She said \"it's not like you are not used to a little extra fat\" She started to laugh but no one else laughed. I cleared my throat and told her that Mike wasn't able to have kids\n\nHow in the hell is that the correct response?  You have decided to share very private and personal information about your partner to his mother after agreeing specifically not to do that.  You did that to \"one up\" her with a shock reveal and you totally violated the trust your partner has.  This entire conflict was one you charged into when you could easily have sidestepped it and now Mike is the one that is suffering as collateral damage in the war between you and his mother.  This is extremely unhealthy at many levels.\n\n>Mike broke his silence and asked me to leave. I was confused because he just let her sit here and disrespect me now he wants to say something.\n\nWhy should you be confused.  He was silent because he didn't want to discuss his fertility, he kept out of the argument you and his mother were both choosing to have and after you completely betrayed him he decided you had crossed a line that was a firm boundary.\n\n> He hasn't been home in a week\n\nYou've most likely killed your relationship entirely.  I'd be surprised if he comes back at all and if he does you need to be very well prepared to share what you really think about the whole thing.\n\n>AITA for telling his mother the truth?\n\nWho gives a F if it is true or not.

Do his mom could pile on OP with no help from her boyfriend and she\u2019s supposed to just sit there and take the onus of them not having biological kids ?    OPs bf should have shut his mom down.

Many opt out of weddings & marriage all together for many reasons. In most places, once you live with a person for a time, youre common law & automatically considered married but in case of breakup, its easier to undo. My boyfriend & i are common law, he's automatically my next of kin. If we break up, i only have to go to my government website & change my marital status to single & he won't be next of kin anymore. \n\nWhile she shouldn't have been the one to blurt that info out, & my judgment is ESH, I think the family & the bf are bigger assholes.", "why would she want a proposal from a spinless coward? if anything op dodged a bullet. if he didn't want op telling his business  he should have opened his fucking mouth and told his mother to shut hers", "I really hope she breaks it off.  \n\nHe needed to set his mother straight.

I was fuming for that poor woman!!!", "If you read op comments, the bf has shared op personal issues to his mom on multiple occasions and this is not the first time the bf mom was being disrespectful.

In addition, these people are all incredibly young and new to the relationship so why should they be having kids anyway?", "It absolutely does not matter who already knows.", "OP isn't a saint, but she behaved much better than her boyfriend. I believe creating this expectation that women should always rise above is how you have multiple generations of women who are essentially doormats to their partners and kids.\n\nYou train people how to treat you and teaching your partner that their disrespect has consequences is a much more effective teaching tool, than having a talk ad nauseum for the next decade.", "I'm sorry but what kind of crack are you on?

I can\u2019t imagine letting my partner be abused like that and me just sit there silently. I\u2019m a grown man and handle my situations. Your boyfriend is a coward. Is that the type of person you want to raise a family with?\n\nYou\u2019re waaaaaay too young to even be thinking about family let alone be married. Give yourself priority and use the next 10 years to focus on yourself and grow. You\u2019ll have a lifetime after that to focus on partners and family.", "NTA, you were being disrespected and you answered back. If this was a balanced relationship, you would have had The Talk about how to deal with this kind of questioning. A lot of couples agree to say \"We\" cannot have children without going into specifics. \n\nMike had the option to jump in and say that, saving you and himself from further humiliation. \n\nThink hard about whether you want to continue this relationship and whether you want children with him. IVF is extremely gruelling for a woman, so you need to be sure you want to endure all this for someone who doesn't support you.", "no, they absolutely would not have. their parter would be still be the asshole for being a spineless coward", "No, if genders were reversed the result would be exactly the same.

Still, it took me years to learn how to deal with that she-demon.\n\nSo I'm not trying to dump on you, I'm trying to tell you things I wish someone had told me.\n\nFor starters, you don't have to answer every question. Deflection is a real skill.

Let 'er rip.\n\n\"The baby won't have your weight.\"\n\n\"Or your intellect, but we're okay with that.\"", "You're 20. You have your whole life in front of you.

There is someone out there who will respect you and defend you.", "\u201cThe situation is out of our hands, and none of your business, we plan on adopting at x time\u201d \nThat would have been WAY more appropriate", "Well, you should stand up for yourself!

Call her fat, talk shit about her, but you could have \"stood up for yourself\" and not given his info out", "You can absolutely defend yourself, and you should. That doesn't really make it ok to disclose information like that.\n\nNext time, try something like \"well I can lose weight, but your face is always going to look like that\"", "Why are you with someone who brings out the worst in you *and* has no detectable backbone whatsoever?", "NTA. When he sat there and let his mother be rude to you, you were correct to set her straight. I do think the relationship is over though, he seems incredibly selfish and you are only 20, move on and find someone else who won't try to hide their insufficiencies by throwing you under the bus.", "Hmmm well that would have been nice to have that information. You sure you want to be with someone who can\u2019t keep personal information a secret? I can see that you were antagonized into doing this but two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. It also seems like you may have wanted to antagonize his mom by saying you were adopting instead of waiting for the right moment. Of course she\u2019s going to want to know and that would lead to revealing his secret. She still had no right to talk to you that way. All in all this seems like a toxic situation.", "So, that means he is untrustworthy. You doing it makes you untrustworthy. Both of you are AH.\n\nYou shouldn't have enev menthoned the plan to adopt. All you needed to say is \"Whave been dating less than a year. Ot is way too soon to start planning on kids.\"", "2 wrongs don't make a right.", "NTA. the minute he sat there and let her berate you, all bets were off. i would have done the same. but you should edit your post to explain this part.", "This whole episode is proof that your future does not lie with this boy or his family. You don\u2019t deserve to lower yourself to someone who has so little respect for you and won\u2019t stand up to his witchy mother.

Don\u2019t be gross.", "So two wrongs make a right?", "Okay, so he sucks. \n\nSeriously, either get couples counseling or break up, but don't use his bad behavior to justify your own.", "Well he shouldn't be doing that either", "Not sure exactly what you\u2019re saying. I did say ESH.", "Did you see the results? Because I would start to mistrust", "Not only that, also they're in their early 20's", "Honestly, to me, no.  \n\nBecause her behavior was disproportionately worse to me.  Because she used his personal issues to fight his mom.", "Yeah, everyone in this sucks big time. To me personally disclosing medical info explicitly against someone\u2019s will is a tier up hence my rating but can 100% understand how others prioritize differently\u2026 the whole dynamic is bad", "\"Mike expressed how he wanted to have a baby\"", "Well tough shit for her! She has a lot of nerve. What his mother wants should factor ZERO percent in what you guys do.", "I loved reading that she moved on and had a kid. The family got pissed at her for not telling them it was the son that had the infertility, LIKE WHAT GTFO.", "link?", "There are a lot of comments here, so finding the OP's comments wasnt exactly easy. That was unknown, but also irrelevant. \n\nIf the bf is toxic in how he deals with her private information, than the appropriate response is to leave the relationship after he refuses to change his behaviour following a conversation about it. Responding in kind just makes an asshole out of her too.", "You know doctors exist right??? Sperm count/health is a VERY easy thing to test homie...", "In what way is OP the problem? She was supposed to just sit there and let his mother talk to her that way? And he just sat idly by and watched it happen? Oh, hell no, absolutely NTA.", "What drugs are you on?", "Idk what toxic ass upbringing y'all lived through but humiliating your partner is very different than standing up to his their mother.

She didn't stand up for herself she just hurt him to get back at her. They're both bad people", "I said he had an opportunity to tell the story he wanted to tell, not that he had to disclose his medical issues. He could have easily said that adoption was a decision that was made together. Or that he was the one who wanted to adopt. Or just told his mother it was none of her business, and to stop it. Especially since it\u2019s his issue that led to their decision. Instead he let his mom harass and blame her and make fun of her weight. He could have controlled the narrative but didn\u2019t. \n\nThere of tons of stories here about men with fertility issues letting their wives/partners take the blame and shame of it all. Eff that.

I didn\u2019t even catch that part I just remember seeing the original post\u2026 freaking good for her!!", "And they have the audacity to act like it\u2019s her fault that things happened.
