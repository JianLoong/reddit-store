I realized how lucky I was to have my average sized breasts.\n\nIt's a good memory. As for hair, my stick straight hair has been a bane. Years of nightly curlers, but some friends were ironing their hair with clothes irons, back then! And getting facial burns! Or rolling hair on orange juice cans. Then 2 decades of perms. Eventually gave up and accepted my hair, now  just glad to have some, post-chemotherapy.", "Hahaha sorry to laugh but this reminded me of a move with Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler where he was a plastic surgeon and she was the assistant and a lady came in who got her implant caught in the car door and popped it and they had to put numbing cream on it and was flicking the nipple to see if it was numbed enough to \u201c reinflate\u201d the boob with saline.", "Omg \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "He needs some shoulder implants to really fill out the suit! I'm just concerned!", "Use a corset for the torso! Steel boning gives tons of back support when it's worn right and added bonus of (at least IME) making you look and feel fab.

You made a decision about what you wanted.   Not about what your SIL wants.  \n\nMaking a decision like this is deeply personal and it\u2019s none of her business.

I can\u2019t imagine what that is like, or what my reaction would be. I think the only thing I can say with confidence is that I wouldn\u2019t choose to have a bust this size. \ud83d\ude05\n\nBut I definitely agree that it\u2019s deeply personal.", "Maybe some pec enhancement too?", "I didn't weigh in on the amita at all, I was having a conversation with the person above my comment.", "My concerns are rapidly mounting. Pec enhancements won't be enough. Maybe we should just put the outfits on some shop mannequins so we don't risk any biological taint on the beautiful wedding", "NTA.

Fortunately I know how to stick up for myself...", "100. ESH. SIL sucks worst, but it was still a childish competition and not the best way to respond.", "Most women who do this shit are actually insecure and it makes them feel good to make another woman insecure. I had small chests when I was younger and some of my friends would do this, but I knew it was only their insecurity. Btw, after menopause my chest grew a whole size...", "Breaking out the Cyrano self-deprecation?", "Yeah. There\u2019s no concern about someone\u2019s small chest.

I don't know what OP's fianc\u00e9's grief about her body is, but the sister seems insecure.\n\nWell, I'm very overweight and really insecure about myself but I don't project it onto others. Every time I hear Meghan Trainors' All About That Bass on the radio I turn it down because it's supposed to be empowering for bigger women but she takes down smaller sized women while doing it. No, don't do that. You can empower one group without belittling another.", "The only condition OP has is a lame ass fianc\u00e9.

ESH", "Agree 100%, the right move was to shut down the bullying, not to join in.", "An eye for an eye means everyone sucks. I hate to come off as overwoke, but I'm also interested in the fianc\u00e9 and his families ethnicity. Making a comment like that could also be racist/xenophobic towards the SIL.", "Yes absolutely. Every woman needs her man to stand by her and defend her even if he does not agree", "BIl laughed", "Because having small breasts ruins weddings. /s", "It means he tuned her out, probably a long term tune out- and only caught \u201cruin the wedding\u201d\u2026even worse", "Yeah, the whole family sounds like a horror show.

You have an 8 year old! You had breasts that fed and nourished your kid. They were landing pads for small hands to drop onto and a place for a little head to cozy against. They did exactly what they needed to. And now they fill out a D-cup and provide shape and structure to your wardrobe. They are probably soft and supple and reflect that side of you as a person. You can dress them up in fancy lingerie, dress them down in a comfy sports bra, you can admire yourself naked and know that your body is a good body and that sure, it\u2019s not what it was, but it\u2019s better because it has stories to tell. It\u2019s done things and been places and created a whole human. So what if your boobs are saggy? They\u2019re just telling their part of your life\u2019s adventure.", "I had a friend that was small chested all her life we\u2019d joke hers was a to b cup and here I am a D and she would say I wish I had bigger boobs.

What kind of torture device is that nonsense? Ugh.", "High quality boning and immaculate tailoring. They work on all chest sizes since the ribcage boning should be doing all the holding up, not the breasts. The breasts should be lifted by the bodice if done correctly, since it's essentially a corset with a skirt attached. \n\nFit is everything and most of us cannot ever think of wearing strapless off the rack.", "I dont think they grew but more stretched with the rest of the skin. I mean I know what you mean by how they get larger but I think it's more stretching than growing.", "Yea they can add pushup padding to make the effect of having a chest so she at least look AND feel good in it", "Or gel inserts if she was really concerned. I wouldn\u2019t want anything artificial in my body unless it\u2019s a new joint or something.", "Decades ago, a friend's silicon implants started to leak. She had them removed and replaced, it was very painful. Years later, another friend had replacements, due to cancer, it was a painful journey.\n\nNow, there are death horror stories regarding Brazilian butt implants, where young women have died, due to the surgery.", "I think women like that think it\u2019s ok since they\u2019re also women. \ud83d\ude1e", "Oh Jesus!

Wouldn't want to have to fight you for the XXL sports bras.\"", "Honestly one of the worst parts was seeing my friend with boobs struggle to find work clothes.

I've had other women like that tell me it was okay for me to let them be a$$holes because we were both women. I was like, ah no, it doesn't work that way. I always feel insulted.", "Oh, no!!

It's okay if you keep it playful and take it along with giving it", "I fucking *love* this story. Thank you!!", "Excellent point! Very perceptive.", "I definitely don't blame OP for her response, but a better approach is probably not to ignore her inappropriate comments and retaliate later, but to firmly call out that she's being inappropriate whenever it happens.\n\n\"What makes you think you can ask/ say something rude like that to me?\"\n\nOr \"your comments about my body are not welcome.

Sure, in a perfect world, OP would have had the calmness and serenity to sit everyone down and have everyone write how they feel on the whiteboard, but she's been made to feel shame about her body for months with no one to defend her.
