Then, a few years later, I found out what a piece of crap he was. Overall, a terrible person and burned several bridges on his way out.\n\nI told my family what happened, and they all seemed to accept and understand the situation.\n\nI moved away for a job opertunity. \u2248 4 years later, I went back home for Christmas and was told my sister was inviting her new boyfriend, which turned out to be DB. Not only did they hide the fact it was him but, they in fact, had even dating for just over a year.\n\nThey got engaged and married within the next 3 months despite my protest and explaining who he truly was and how it would end up.\n\nA big fight later, I went no contact for 4 years after a really bad argument where nasty things from her side were said. \"He's not like that.\"\u00a0 \"He's a changed man.\" Parents were on team DB and sis. I skipped the wedding and all family events since.\n\nTwo weeks ago, my parents reached out and said my mom wasn't doing well and I needed to come home. So I did.\n\nWhen I showed up, my mom was well and healthy. Needless to say, I was confused. Until my sister walked in and was basically an ambush. She asked that I hear her/ them out.\n\nShe was getting a divorce. The last few years had not been good for her. Basically, everything I said would happen did. She/they missed me and more. Parents chimed in next and said their piece.\n\nI just sat there quiet until they were done talking, gave my mom and dad a hug, grabbed my things and said something to the effect this was fun, see you in 4 years and left to drive back home.\n\nThen, the calls and messages started. Parents, sister (with a new number) and family I have not talked to in the last 4 years all called me a heartless AH. \"I abandoned my sister in her time of need.\"My family needs me.\"Im breaking my family apart.\"How could i break my moms heart like this.\" With several other guilt tripping messages.\u00a0\n\nI feel I'm not the AH. But with so many people on their side, it is getting harder to tell. My partner said that they lied and had me come under false pretensions to ambush me to get their way. But the way I did handle /am currently handling the situation makes me a little AHoley\n\nAm I the AH?\n\nTLDR had an old \"friend\" who showed his true colors to me. Later on, he started dating my sister even after I told my family the type of man he was. They married and 3ish years later are now divorcing after proving I was right. They lied to me to get me back, but now that I want nothing to do with my sisters issues, im an AH.", "created_utc": 1698403944, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17hkuq1/aita_for_not_supporting_my_sister_after_she/", "score": 295, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wouldn\u2019t have even said anything/listened to whatever they had to say. \n\nThat\u2019s said, people who have that level of manipulation, and so little regard for others feelings generally don\u2019t give a shit about why they are asshole. So, telling them \u201comg you ambushed me. My feeling are hurt. You manipulated me\u201d isn\u2019t going to change a single thing, and you\u2019re just playing into their crazy/manipulation/victimhood. \n\nHopefully op stands strong, and doesn\u2019t feel too bad. Absolutely NTA and hopefully the family doesn\u2019t cry wolf anymore, or when mom really is sick op won\u2019t be there.", "Nah she wasn't an asshole saying that", ">You cut off your own sister in hopes of an 'told you so' moment. It finally came, you said it and abandoned her again. Was that 'I told you so' not enough?\n\n\n\n\nYou underestimate the impact assholes can have on those they deal with. \n\nOp warned them and removed herself. Has nothing to do with waiting for a moment. Would you say the same if the 'moment' never came? \n\nAnd ambushing Op. What's that about? How is Op supposed to stay and coddle her sister?", "I don't get all the \"NTA\" responses here. Nobody cares about details apparently. OP sounds petty AF, and without giving any details as to why DB is so bad, that just reinforces it for me. YTA", "OP completely left out any details that would paint this DB as the bad guy. We are just supposed to accept it? Yeah, no. That's not how this works. Sounds like OP's hiding something.", "If they're like my family was, it's \"See? We don't disagree with you anymore! Now you can forget your tantrum and get back into your place!\"\n\nUm... How about no?", "How is him skipping family events translated to them ostracizing him?", "4. Sister wants to live with OP.\n\n5. Sister will (un)consciously ruin OP's life.", "Damn, I'd like a hood lawyer too sheeeeet", "You're probably right, and my money is on the family wanting OP to support their sister financially.", "i mean the one where they knew op didn\u2019t want to see their sister, so they lied to get them there, and the one where they said \u201csee you in four years\u201d and they seem, from the post, to be non stop spamming op\u2019s phone saying awful shit to them. i mean knowing op wants space, because it has been made abundantly clear, and pushing as hard as they can to bulldoze every wall op puts up.", "yi yi", ">no contact for 4 years after a really bad argument where nasty things from her side were said. \"He's not like that.\"  \"He's a changed man.\" Parents were on team DB and sis.\n\nOP\u2019s whole family sided with sister + DB after a bad argument were nasty things were said to OP from sister\u2019s side. I would say that counts as ostracizing OP, who then went no contact for four years **after** this all took place."]}
