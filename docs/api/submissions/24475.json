At this point, she is bound to accuse someone of something because she believes there MUST be someone doing something inappropriate.   \n\n\nAlso, your response is completely normal.

To me, it sounds like she had a bad experience or experiences. That kind of stuff can be traumatizing.

Best you can do is try again to explain to her that you understand that she may have had bad experiences in the past, but you haven't gotten any creepy vibes from anyone where you work and you'll let her know if that changes?

I can certainly understand her wanting to know if there's problematic people on the team. But a better way she could have asked would have been, \"Hey, have you had any problems working here as a woman given our largely male work force?\" To which you could have answered that you personally have not had any issues with anyone at this time. But the fact that she asked specifically about issue men, and wanting names and who to avoid. I feel like she's already pegged one or more men she'd like an excuse to not work with and was hoping you'd give her a reason, especially if she hasn't had any real issues, just being judgmental.", "NTA\n\nWell now you know your new hire is someone who craves drama and will create it when there's none available.

First off, are we even sure this lovely lady (/s) is asking the names so she can *avoid* them? Because if you are looking for a person to avoid and you don't know who, tendency is to avoid them all, and ask someone \"safe\" who the approachable one is. Or you know, give everyone the benefit of the doubt with guard slightly up.\n\nAnd second, since OP won't name drop someone she can \"avoid,\" chances are, she'll do the dirty work herself. Like, ask the guys uncomfortable questions with some sort of \"gotcha\" ulterior motive to \"check\" if they're creeps. Either that or, worse, not straight up questions but \"tests\" like--I really don't feel like giving examples, you get the gist. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nHarassment can go both ways, and mere allegations regardless of basis can make a man's (or anyone's, really) career do a full 180 in a matter of seconds.

ASAP.\n\nNTA, OP.", "She wasn't until she started accusing OP of covering for creeps by saying OP would rather keep a boys club", "^^^ THIS.

She may be up to something that OP does not want to get dragged into.", "Seriously. I'm a guy, and at one job if asked 'Who's the creep to avoid' I would have an instantaneous and certain answer of one of our team leads. At my last job? I literally can't think of a single person who was 'that guy', although it was also remote working, so if there had been a 'that guy', lingering around desks and shit wouldn't have given them away.", "OP might wanna talk to their manager about this.  Asking if there is anyone that she should avoid for her own safety is one thing - insisting that OP is lying about not feeling unsafe in the workplace because of anyone is an entirely different matter.\n\nIn the very least, the manager is more qualified to address how they handle workplace problems with the new hire than OP is.  I know I'm biased in my red flag senses going off (my last job, the new hire ended up being super toxic and harassing multiple people, to put simply), but her insisting on names of toxic coworkers without any explanation or evidence makes me feel funny about her.", "THIS! I saw it happening to a girl I worked with. The newly hired girl tried to drag her into pretty bad drama. But she was smart enough to avoid the trap.", "One of those that run to HR if you talk to her or tun to HR if you don't talk to her.", "I agree, it sounds like she is looking to stir things up. It sounds like she is fishing for a reason to start trouble.", "Big assumption. Also you really don't wanna assume a co-worker had a traumatic event in the past? This is just drama.

I line manage several younger women, and I'm a designated 'safe space' for junior staff not under my direct line to come to in confidence.\n\nIf we had a problem with 'creepers', I would know.  The last one we had was five years ago, and he was dealt with real quick.", "This is what my thoughts are. \n\nIt\u2019s possible someone has said something to her, or she\u2019s getting vibes from someone and just wants to check with the only other woman if it\u2019s a known problem or if she might be overreacting.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, even normal, for one person to not have an issue with someone and for someone else to have an entirely different experience with that one person.\n\nBut new coworker is definitely in the wrong for accusing her of lying,", "Limit it to \u2018office talk\u2019 and work talk only is the best bet to avoid an HR nightmare", "Is it really a \"big\" assumption when most women have had a bad experience? Maybe she was a little dramatic, but I'd give her the benefit of the doubt in this situation unless she continues to push the issue.", "Its possible OP sees inappropriate comments as just jokes and isn't offended, when this other woman is. Everyone has different standards of what's acceptable.", "NTA - while I understand that she wants to avoid any office creeps and there probably are some at your workplace, you don't know who they are, so your response was fine.

You can of course ask her if anything is going on, that would be a nice thing to do but if she says nothing then good riddance. I admit, it does feel hard to believe that no one is creepy, but also have to consider that they don't have a lot of opportunity and a real predator often picks someone where he senses the person will be quiet. Maybe people know not to try with you but regardless she's being mean to you for something that's not your responsibility.

Its the exception rather than the rule that there are men who DONT and honestly, many of the ones who DO are great at hiding it from people who are not their targets. You cant be faulted for not warning her of predators that may or may not exist, but more importantly, you cant be faulted for not seeing the behavior of predators you are unaware of that might not be targeting you but may target her.
