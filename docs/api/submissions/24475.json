If she refuses to believe you, that's her problem & not yours.", "NTA. \n\nIf you truly believe that the men you work with aren't creeps then they aren't creeps. And fyi to her, *not all men are*. Some just go to work, get work done and go home to food, sleep, and wake up to it all again.", "NTA.\n\nIt isn't that you aren't protecting the new hire, it is that you have not observed/experienced any issues that she needs warning or protecting from. \n\nShe is not the AH for being wary - she could easily have encountered issues in the past, as could any number of her friends or family members. \n\nWhat tips her into AH territory is her subsequent attitude, putting pre-emptive blame on you and offering what I presume she views as being an insult (not being a girls' girl) . The fact she actually asked to walk with you to give her the opportunity to complain about this is odd.", "NAH. Honestly I can't judge her as an asshole without being certain as to whether she's pre-empting any issues with men or if she's getting bad vibes or already had issues and that's why she doesn't believe that everyone's being nice. But either way, I expect this is coming from a bad previous experience so please do keep that in mind.", "NTA.  The start cataloging your experiences. I had something like this happened at my work. girl was just a pit of drama. Everything was relaxing everybody got along and then when she joined the team everything went to shit. \n\nShe would take everything personally, she would take everything out of context, believe that anybody talking badly about something in their life was about her. It was exhausting talking or hanging out with this woman.", "NTA. Avoid her at all costs, sounds like she's looking for trouble.", "NTA. And no, her past experiences do not give her a pass to go and accuse another woman like that. She *repeatedly* accused op of lying.", "You're NTA at all. She seems like a toxic colleague who can't believe that you can have a group of men without a creep being amongst them.\n\nYou handled it well.", "Urrg, this split is annoying. Trying an us vs them mentality is the reason we have issues in the first place, you can of course disagree with female work colleagues and not be \"part of the boys club:\" just like I cam disagree with the men about women and not be a \"natzi feminist \" (others words)", "NTA. You were honest. It's not fair to assume people are creepy just because of their gender. If it makes you feel better, tell her you'll let her know if anyone starts to act creepy. But no one should make up lies about certain coworkers being creepy when they haven't been.", "NTA and you should let HR know about this line of conversation. She is assuming a lot of negative things about your coworkers and making you uncomfortable with her demands of you. She is going to be trouble. Avoid her as much as you can, since she is already blaming you for the imagined actions of others and putting weird, sexist expectations on you. Get in front of this. If she brings it up again, tell her to please stop trying to get you to gossip and lie about your coworkers. They've all been great to you and you're not going to malign your coworkers for her, or fulfill any kind of \"Us\" vs. \"Them\" dynamic. If she feels someone is being inappropriate, she should take her concerns to HR, and not you.", "NTA. She's the person who looks for a problem and makes one up when there isn't one. Workplace drama is always good to avoid.", "NTA: She is definitely a drama queen. Whenever someone asks you to name names the only appropriate answer is silence. You never know what someone might do with this kind of information. You could easily find yourself embroiled in a HR issue. \n\nIf your company has a good culture this shouldn't be a problem.", "NTA... she seems hellbent on starting crap with the others.", "I find her initial question fair, there are definitely plenty of creepy/assholeish men in the world (really just people in general) but she should have believed you at first and not kept pressing", "NTA. Tell her that if she having issues with someone, she should report it. I honestly would keep my distance. She sounds like someone that looks for drama.", "NTA, she\u2019s not a girls\u2019 girl", "\"I understand that you've had some bad experiences before. But I do not appreciate that you assume I'm lying to you. If I thought anyone here was creepy, I would have reported it before you got here, or been more than happy to clue you in. So far, the closest thing I've experienced to sexual harassment working here is your assumption that some of our coworkers *must* be creepy because they are men and your attitude towards me that I *must* be lying to you because I'm a woman who has decided to ally myself with men instead of women.\"\n\nNTA. Look, if you *were* lying to her/refusing to answer her question because you had chosen predators over a potential victim, you would be an AH (although even then, not because you are a woman: that behavior is equally AH-ish coming from a man)\n\nBut you weren't.

Tell her if someone makes her uncomfortable to report it to HR.", "NAH\n\nIt sounds like her past experience (family, school, work, sports, activities) has shown her that there are ALWAYS some.

I\u2019d limit contact with her. She might become trouble in the future.", "Do you also have to tell her what streets not to walk down or what bars to avoid?", "NTA. Her asking once is understandable, her persisting sounds like she'll be causing drama, watch out. \n\nI work in a predominantly male environment too and have never had any issues, some people don't seem to think that's possible.", "Oh boy, she's one of THOSE types. She's looking to start trouble. NTA.", "NTA \n\nYou may want to give HR a heads up, that she is the type to look for issues, in situations and people, when there aren't any and that she refuses to believe that the office is truly a safe environment.", "NTA... I'd just look at her and say\n\n\"I think we see things differntly. I'm drama free and want to stay that way.\"", "NTA. Watch out for the new hire, she\u2019s trouble. This happened to me frequently, since I was one of the first women licensed in a male dominated profession. Newly hired women would cause problems unnecessarily or be really difficult to work with.\n\nMy intuition says that if you said anything at all about any man on your team, she would run and tell them immediately.", "NTA I know what she means as from time to time at parties I have been approached by other women that warn you about the creepy guy and what not. but usually that information is given. in my experience the creepy guy shows like 1% of the time and when they show the others will let me k ow and i will let the others know. she sounds like she is looking to gossip or for trouble", "NTA, if you\u2019ve had no negative experiences what does she want you to do? Make up bullshit to satisfy her need for a bad guy? Sounds like she\u2019s a drama starter and I\u2019d keep my distance if I were you.", "Nta she is.  She likes conflict and if it doesn't exist she creates it.  Avoid her. If she asks why tell her she has basically called you a liar for your honest opinion of men at work. She is the creepy one here not the men.  Why does she think she is so hot that the men won't be able to resist harassing  her? Very weird person.", "NTA\n\nI mean you would be if there WAS a sketchy guy and you didn\u2019t tell her. But there isn\u2019t so what are you supposed to do?", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nOh hell no, she\u2019s drama to be avoided", "NTA. This is bizarre behavior on her part. You haven't experienced problems, so she's basically accusing you of lying?!  I'd push back on that. Be very careful with this person. If you appeased her with, \"Well, that guy Bob has a weird gaze sometimes,\" she will probably quote you on that later when she accuses Bob of harassment.", "She\u2019s looking to be offended. You can\u2019t help people like that. it\u2019s a red flag, though, so be careful around her. It sounds like your formally great office may have a snake in the grass.  NTA", "NTA, but if your company has a HR, I'd bring it up with them to have a paper trail started. Protect yourself and distance yourself from her.", "NTA \n\nKeep your distance. I don't want to be too harsh on her either but she sounds paranoid. I understand why she would feel intimidated in a 99% male dominant environment. She might have had past experiences in workplaces where she felt violated by \"creeps\". However, it is just insane to keep looking for problematic behavior where there is none. At this point, she is bound to accuse someone of something because she believes there MUST be someone doing something inappropriate.   \n\n\nAlso, your response is completely normal. Can't point out where the fire is when there is no flame. Don't let her guilt trip you into saying something you'll regret later because you also might start second guessing innocent interactions for something nefarious.", "NTA. I think asking about creepy men is a valid question but when you genuinely answered that everyone was kind and respectful she should have believed you and left it at that.", "NTA - I\u2019d keep my eye on her and also keep my distance from her \u2026 she could be trouble", "Just report her to HR. She apparently wants to create a hostile work environment", "Just tell her hey, I\u2019ve experienced that before but never here.", "Agreeing with the NAH comments. To me, it sounds like she had a bad experience or experiences. That kind of stuff can be traumatizing. Although, I think it's a little extreme for her to be so insistent that you're lying or something. Best you can do is try again to explain to her that you understand that she may have had bad experiences in the past, but you haven't gotten any creepy vibes from anyone where you work and you'll let her know if that changes? Something along those lines.", "NTA.  Although it is rare, it is possible that there are zero creep coworkers.  She shouldn't have jumped straight to not believing you.", "NTA \n\nShe is looking for problems where they don\u2019t exist and is one of \u201cthose types\u201d of women. Not every man is a sexist pig or even vulgar to women. I\u2019d stay away from that one if I was you!", "NTA, it almost sounds like she's looking for trouble. I can certainly understand her wanting to know if there's problematic people on the team. But a better way she could have asked would have been, \"Hey, have you had any problems working here as a woman given our largely male work force?\" To which you could have answered that you personally have not had any issues with anyone at this time. But the fact that she asked specifically about issue men, and wanting names and who to avoid. I feel like she's already pegged one or more men she'd like an excuse to not work with and was hoping you'd give her a reason, especially if she hasn't had any real issues, just being judgmental.", "NTA\n\nWell now you know your new hire is someone who craves drama and will create it when there's none available. I'd suggest you slow walk away from this blooming friendship.", "NTA\n\nWe had a woman join a team of men and women, some of whom had worked together for 10+ years. She made a complaint, men were sent home while there was an investigation, it turned out to be made up, and she had done similar in a previous work place. She was fired.", "NAH", "NTA.\n\nBut you could ask her if she is having a problem with anyone. That's not being a girls girl. That's looking out for the welfare of a colleague. Gender doesn't need to come into it. \n\nWould you want to support any other, by default male, colleague if they were having issues with anyone?", "NTA \n\nSometimes, you do run across workplaces where all the men are decent people.", "She obviously expected something different, but you are NTA for answering people's questions honestly and to the best of your knowledge, even if it's not what they want to hear. However, when they respond to that with aggressive negativity directed at you as a person, *ad hominem* attacks, they are most definitely an asshole.", "NTA. Avoid situations in which you two are alone together. Shes already formed an unfavorable opinion of you so shes not worth your time or energy. Keep things polite amd professional.", "NTA", "NTA", "If you don't know the answer to her question, then you can't be the AH for not answering her.  If she insists that you must know and that you must just be protecting the boys, that's on her.  \n\n\nNTA.", "You say this in jest but I seriously think that might be a good idea", ">Should the men be warned?\n\nActually, and I cannot stress this enough, YES. First off, are we even sure this lovely lady (/s) is asking the names so she can *avoid* them? Because if you are looking for a person to avoid and you don't know who, tendency is to avoid them all, and ask someone \"safe\" who the approachable one is. Or you know, give everyone the benefit of the doubt with guard slightly up.\n\nAnd second, since OP won't name drop someone she can \"avoid,\" chances are, she'll do the dirty work herself. Like, ask the guys uncomfortable questions with some sort of \"gotcha\" ulterior motive to \"check\" if they're creeps. Either that or, worse, not straight up questions but \"tests\" like--I really don't feel like giving examples, you get the gist. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nHarassment can go both ways, and mere allegations regardless of basis can make a man's (or anyone's, really) career do a full 180 in a matter of seconds. And worse? OP's name might be dragged in it. So TL;DR, yes, the men should be warned. ASAP.\n\nNTA, OP.", "She wasn't until she started accusing OP of covering for creeps by saying OP would rather keep a boys club", "^^^ THIS. Tagging along to this comment to say catalog your experiences with her by emailing a non-work email from your work email (versus emailing yourself within the same work email) to have an external copy in case she has access to someone who could wipe it from the internal server.", "NTA and yes I think you're right. She may be up to something that OP does not want to get dragged into.", "Seriously. I'm a guy, and at one job if asked 'Who's the creep to avoid' I would have an instantaneous and certain answer of one of our team leads. At my last job? I literally can't think of a single person who was 'that guy', although it was also remote working, so if there had been a 'that guy', lingering around desks and shit wouldn't have given them away.", "OP might wanna talk to their manager about this.  Asking if there is anyone that she should avoid for her own safety is one thing - insisting that OP is lying about not feeling unsafe in the workplace because of anyone is an entirely different matter.\n\nIn the very least, the manager is more qualified to address how they handle workplace problems with the new hire than OP is.  I know I'm biased in my red flag senses going off (my last job, the new hire ended up being super toxic and harassing multiple people, to put simply), but her insisting on names of toxic coworkers without any explanation or evidence makes me feel funny about her.", "THIS! I saw it happening to a girl I worked with. The newly hired girl tried to drag her into pretty bad drama. But she was smart enough to avoid the trap.", "One of those that run to HR if you talk to her or tun to HR if you don't talk to her.", "I agree, it sounds like she is looking to stir things up. It sounds like she is fishing for a reason to start trouble.", "Big assumption. Also you really don't wanna assume a co-worker had a traumatic event in the past? This is just drama. Steer clear", "We don't have any in my workplace.  I line manage several younger women, and I'm a designated 'safe space' for junior staff not under my direct line to come to in confidence.\n\nIf we had a problem with 'creepers', I would know.  The last one we had was five years ago, and he was dealt with real quick.", "This is what my thoughts are. \n\nIt\u2019s possible someone has said something to her, or she\u2019s getting vibes from someone and just wants to check with the only other woman if it\u2019s a known problem or if she might be overreacting.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, even normal, for one person to not have an issue with someone and for someone else to have an entirely different experience with that one person.\n\nBut new coworker is definitely in the wrong for accusing her of lying,", "Limit it to \u2018office talk\u2019 and work talk only is the best bet to avoid an HR nightmare", "Is it really a \"big\" assumption when most women have had a bad experience? Maybe she was a little dramatic, but I'd give her the benefit of the doubt in this situation unless she continues to push the issue.", "Its possible OP sees inappropriate comments as just jokes and isn't offended, when this other woman is. Everyone has different standards of what's acceptable."]}
