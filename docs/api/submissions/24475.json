To me, it sounds like she had a bad experience or experiences. That kind of stuff can be traumatizing.

Best you can do is try again to explain to her that you understand that she may have had bad experiences in the past, but you haven't gotten any creepy vibes from anyone where you work and you'll let her know if that changes?

But a better way she could have asked would have been, \"Hey, have you had any problems working here as a woman given our largely male work force?\" To which you could have answered that you personally have not had any issues with anyone at this time. But the fact that she asked specifically about issue men, and wanting names and who to avoid. I feel like she's already pegged one or more men she'd like an excuse to not work with and was hoping you'd give her a reason, especially if she hasn't had any real issues, just being judgmental.", "NTA\n\nWell now you know your new hire is someone who craves drama and will create it when there's none available.

First off, are we even sure this lovely lady (/s) is asking the names so she can *avoid* them? Because if you are looking for a person to avoid and you don't know who, tendency is to avoid them all, and ask someone \"safe\" who the approachable one is. Or you know, give everyone the benefit of the doubt with guard slightly up.\n\nAnd second, since OP won't name drop someone she can \"avoid,\" chances are, she'll do the dirty work herself. Like, ask the guys uncomfortable questions with some sort of \"gotcha\" ulterior motive to \"check\" if they're creeps. Either that or, worse, not straight up questions but \"tests\" like--I really don't feel like giving examples, you get the gist. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nHarassment can go both ways, and mere allegations regardless of basis can make a man's (or anyone's, really) career do a full 180 in a matter of seconds.

ASAP.\n\nNTA, OP.", "She wasn't until she started accusing OP of covering for creeps by saying OP would rather keep a boys club", "^^^ THIS.

She may be up to something that OP does not want to get dragged into.", "Seriously. I'm a guy, and at one job if asked 'Who's the creep to avoid' I would have an instantaneous and certain answer of one of our team leads. At my last job? I literally can't think of a single person who was 'that guy', although it was also remote working, so if there had been a 'that guy', lingering around desks and shit wouldn't have given them away.", "OP might wanna talk to their manager about this.  Asking if there is anyone that she should avoid for her own safety is one thing - insisting that OP is lying about not feeling unsafe in the workplace because of anyone is an entirely different matter.\n\nIn the very least, the manager is more qualified to address how they handle workplace problems with the new hire than OP is.  I know I'm biased in my red flag senses going off (my last job, the new hire ended up being super toxic and harassing multiple people, to put simply), but her insisting on names of toxic coworkers without any explanation or evidence makes me feel funny about her.", "THIS! I saw it happening to a girl I worked with. The newly hired girl tried to drag her into pretty bad drama. But she was smart enough to avoid the trap.", "One of those that run to HR if you talk to her or tun to HR if you don't talk to her.", "I agree, it sounds like she is looking to stir things up. It sounds like she is fishing for a reason to start trouble.", "Big assumption. Also you really don't wanna assume a co-worker had a traumatic event in the past? This is just drama.

I line manage several younger women, and I'm a designated 'safe space' for junior staff not under my direct line to come to in confidence.\n\nIf we had a problem with 'creepers', I would know.  The last one we had was five years ago, and he was dealt with real quick.", "This is what my thoughts are. \n\nIt\u2019s possible someone has said something to her, or she\u2019s getting vibes from someone and just wants to check with the only other woman if it\u2019s a known problem or if she might be overreacting.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, even normal, for one person to not have an issue with someone and for someone else to have an entirely different experience with that one person.\n\nBut new coworker is definitely in the wrong for accusing her of lying,", "Limit it to \u2018office talk\u2019 and work talk only is the best bet to avoid an HR nightmare", "Is it really a \"big\" assumption when most women have had a bad experience? Maybe she was a little dramatic, but I'd give her the benefit of the doubt in this situation unless she continues to push the issue.", "Its possible OP sees inappropriate comments as just jokes and isn't offended, when this other woman is. Everyone has different standards of what's acceptable.", "NTA - while I understand that she wants to avoid any office creeps and there probably are some at your workplace, you don't know who they are, so your response was fine.

You can of course ask her if anything is going on, that would be a nice thing to do but if she says nothing then good riddance. I admit, it does feel hard to believe that no one is creepy, but also have to consider that they don't have a lot of opportunity and a real predator often picks someone where he senses the person will be quiet.

You cant be faulted for not warning her of predators that may or may not exist, but more importantly, you cant be faulted for not seeing the behavior of predators you are unaware of that might not be targeting you but may target her.

It's far more likely that this woman is just genuinely concerned.\n\nI've been low-key warned about people at just about every job I've ever worked (not always for \"creep\" reasons) and I probably wouldn't believe that the office didn't have a single problem, especially if there was only one woman there and it sounds like it's a decent size staff. But like you say, I wouldn't have pushed.", "Oh I agree I have tons of comments calling out misandry though heads up it is misandrist though no sweat it\u2019s easy to mix up, it\u2019s not used nearly enough\n\nAlso both men and women can be both misogynistic and misandrist, neither is perpetrated by one gender only", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Claiming victimhood can be a great manipulation tactic.\n\n Add on top of that, psychopaths and other unsavory characters can still be victims who deserve justice, and it's clear we can't use any simple heuristic to evaluate who to believe.\n\nEvery case has to be evaluated on its own merits. Systemic/implicit biases should be acknowledged and hopefully decent people will take steps to counteract any such internal biases.

This isn't specific to women. \n\nWhen it comes to sexual harassment and violence, I will always support and believe the victim. The \"believe women\" thing is in response to a larger issue of dismissing women's issues - most glaringly (after sexual violence) in medical settings for example, where the health issues of people who menstruate are constantly called into question and attributed to their oh so mysterious menstrual cycle, or stress, or historically things like \"hysteria\"\n\n>Also stop using afab as a \"women light\".\n\nI'm not, I'm literally nb.

Please don't act like afab nb people, and many trans men, don't experience the ill effects of misogyny bc that is just plainly wrong", "To follow up, something I've discussed before with my lady friends is there's whole generations of men who have been abused (sexually and otherwise) and we will *never* know because there's still so, so many men that don't know or are afraid/ashamed of coming forward, in denial etc. because of...everything; there's too much stuff to list.   \n\n\nI really hope as time goes on that this advocation for male victims encourages more of them to come forward and be believed.   \n\n\nAlso NTA, OP.", "You keep skirting 99% of the post, focusing on something out of context, and deciding what my opinion is on matters in order to then argue whatever it is you want to argue. Dont insist im saying stuff that i quite frankly have neither said nor implied, and then go off on this pathetic little angry rant. I dont know what your problem is, but its tiresome.\n\nHeres a response to each of your false claims:\n\n> No one cared that she asked initially about shitty men\n\nNo one cared, not 1 person?? Since when? Kinda felt like OP cared, and its hardly like the comments are split on this. So who, who's ACTUALLY expressed that it was reasonable she asked about shitty men, rather than you assuming it because it wasnt explicitly said ergo *blatent sexism*.\n\n> The fact that you're ok with her asking about problematic men in the workplace\n\nNope. Never once suggested it was okay. Show me ONCE where i suggest or imply anything remotely of the sort.\n\n> scared shitless over warning of a potentially problematic woman in the workplace is blatant fucking sexism\n\nNo, im reminding OP that if they've got this wrong, shit lands firmly on them if they handle it improperly. But, of course you're screaming sexism when theres no mention of gender in how im saying it should be handled. You are the only person fixated on gender.\n\n> Crazy lady wanted that info from op that you're so scared about hr hearing about when it comes to warning the men.\n\nThe guy who's repeatedly said the correct approach is to leave it to HR and let them deal with it in the appropriate manner, because oddly enough, thats their job... is \"so scared about HR hearing\"??... Thats right... AND IM SEXIST TOO, right? Come on, for someone so sharp and observant, you're missing telltale signs!\n\n> If you knew about a toxic male employee would you go to HR and not mention it to anyone?\n\nIf ANY gendered person was toxic in the workplace, i'd go to HR, and let them deal with the matter. It isnt my job to dictate how its dealt with, thats their job, its what they're trained to do, and are paid to do. It wouldnt be my job, and it sure as shit aint yours!\n\n> This fucking sexist subreddit never ceases to amaze me\n\nTell me about it. Theres this one ignorant user who's obsessed with bringing peoples gender into matters and using that and What If's to determine how things should be actioned. Most people would think one person acting inappropriately to another was as simple as it needs to get to know its wrong. But not them, genitals need to be considered. Your fate rests on whether you have an innie or and outie...", "Lmao you're so full of shit that you would not mention a toxic employee to anyone at work other than HR. Do you talk to anyone? Are you friendly with anyone where you would give warning of someone? Do people even talk to you?\n\nOh man this is some good shit.

You\u2019ve never had a problem with any of your colleagues so why start one.

Most of them are like most of us women--decent normal people who are just trying to get through life. \n\nThere would be nothing wrong with her asking IF there are any creeps to be careful around.
