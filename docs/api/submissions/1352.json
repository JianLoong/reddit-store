I don't see any reference to MIL goading on this awkward interaction.", "ESH. Your poor mom... with a husband who asks another man for his ex-wife's nudes, a soon to be in-law that jokes about her husband wanting to f\\*\\*\\* his ex, and your lousy mil, who hurt HER because her husband has a crush on her fiance's ex. I would have blasted ALL of them for humiliating my mom (including your lousy dad and the fiance). \n\nIt was nice of her to let you use the house, but NOT if she uses that opportunity to humiliate her guests. I wouldn't have any shared family holidays in the future, and I think what you said to her was great. I'd also tell my dad I hope my mom one day wakes up and leaves him (and I'd offer my mom a place to stay if I had the room... your dad is a PIG). \n\nYou are NTA, but your anger should be directed at all of them."]}
