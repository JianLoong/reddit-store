You are not dirt cheap child care. Good that you told your sister to take a hike, and that you will no longer babysit her kids. Don\u2019t let her guilt trip you. You have your own life to live.

Not yours.", "NTA, she wants cheap child care from you and those kids are her responsibility, not yours. Tell her to find another babysitter who will take the job or a daycare. If she can afford two kids and has a husband who is most likely working she can afford a babysitter and/or daycare. You're their aunt, not her discount babysitter.", "NTA - You deserve a life filled with studies and your own job-not being a second mom to 2 kids that are not yours. Your sister has managed to make it a full time job for you-you\u2019ve become her personal assistant. \n\nContinue to tell her no and pursue your own life. Good luck!", "NTA.\n\nAs the parent, your sister is responsible for taking care of them.  If you don't want to anymore, then she needs to find someone else.", "NTA \n\nI also have two kids and I could never imagine asking my younger sister to watch my kids full time all week especially for $100. I'm glad to hear you got a job I hope your life continues to move forward and you achieve your goals", "NTA. She made the decision to have children, not you. It would be one thing if her requests were only every once in a while, but it sounds like she is asking you to be another parent. And, at 18, you are at the point where you should be making plans to leave home and start your own life, not be tied down being your sister\u2019s (underpaid) hired help. \n\nHonestly, if anyone is ungrateful, it is your sister, as she obviously doesn\u2019t appreciate how much of your own life you have given up already to help her.", "NTA - You are in a free hiring market and her compensation is woefully insulting.

Honestly I got a sister myself who had her first kid and I babysat for a lot, she liked to go out and get black out drunk despite being a mother. One time she asked me to babysit I was meeting my now husband for the first time, we met online and his visit was for a week so I told her no I wanted to spend my time with my man. She asked again and I said no she even offered to pay me I still said no, I told her find someone else or just stay in for once. Oh my God she went off on one telling me I called her a bad mother (I didn't),  then called me a bunch of nasty names and saying all I had to do was say no... \n\nYeah op set your boundaries look out for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you have leftover time, a job for fair pay would give you funding for your next round of school plus a more-rounded college application. \n\nFamily does need to help family, but it is a two way street. \"Helping\" does not mean that one person sacrifices their future in exchange for crumbs just so the other person doesn't have to bother fulfilling their own responsibilities. Your sister needs to stop being selfish.\n\nNTA for not ignoring your own needs.", "NTA for wanting to prioritize yourself. It appears you want to be helpful but your sister is taking advantage a bit. I\u2019d definitely get a bit of a pay increase if you\u2019re treating it like a job", "NTA. You should be working for what you're worth. Helping your sister out now and then? Sure. But you should be focusing on your future and $100 is ridiculous. She needs to realize that she can't expect you to be an almost-free babysitter forever. Good luck in your future!!", "NTA\n\n> she called me ungrateful \n\nUngrateful for what?  Subminimum wage?", "INFO: What does her husband do?\n\nNTA, though. Nobody is entitled to free childcare from relatives, and you're going to have to eventually take a job where you can't be on babysitting duty all the time. Sure, you could have been more tactful, but she's trying to guilt you into taking care of her kids. Plenty of *single* women take care of their children without relying entirely on underpaid childcare from their younger sisters. I mean, frankly, it's shameful that modern democracies have women who can't afford childcare while they work on their careers, but that's not your problem (unless you vote CONservative, in which case, it is your fault).", "NTA. Your sister made her own choices and now you get to make yours. You have already helped her out a lot, now you must work on your own life.  Sister needs to learn to be an Independant adult.", "NTA. Find out what a nanny would earn. Because you were her nanny.", "NTA. You are not the parent and not responsible. Go live your life!", "Only you can stand up for yourself. No one else will do this for you. It's not selfish, it's common sense. She furnished her life with you for her own sake and now you ruined her comfort. You're not an ottoman to be around all day in case she needs you. How long exactly does she want to stop your life? 15-20 years?", "What does her husband do for his kids? The two of them should be taking care of them. She took advantage of you because $100 is an insult. Damn. You even drove them around and did the shopping. Good luck with your future. You deserve to have some fun.", "NTA.  She\u2019s using you.", "NTA. Ungrateful for what? Making way less than you would babysitting a neighbour kid for the same amount of time?\n\nI'm guessing your parents aren't in the picture to help?\n\nEdit: reread and they're giving you a stipend? So why doesn't she just drop them off at their grandparents' like every other struggling parent?", "Nta. She just want cheap babysitter not your responsible. Don't babysitting for her because she will never pay more for that.", "Nope, people should be grateful when family members take care of their kids and the fact that people have their own lives and responsibilities to deal with.", "NTA-Parenting  is an incredibly tough job but it\u2019s one she chose not you. You are not ungrateful or rude for deciding that you want to live your life as more than her underpaid babysitter.", "NTA \n\nSure helping out every so often is fine but she basically wants you to babysit for free and leave no time for yourself. \n\nTell her to pay you a reasonable amount (maybe a little cheaper than an babysitter) or she needs to find one. You can say you're happy to help out maybe once or twice a week but if you're doing it everyday you're spending what would be your free time having to look after her kids without it benefiting anyone apart from her.", "NTA. And it seems that your sister thinks she is so clever to find such cheat babysitter.", "NTA but please check in with the kids now and then. Sounds like she may be emotionally distant from them and neglect can still be a factor", "NTA --- Next time she demands you look after her children remind her she is their mother not you and therefore they are her responsibility, not yours.", "YTA. Your sister's obviously in a tough spot, you know she needs your help and is trying to get you to turn down the job to keep helping her but wont admit it, and you snap at her? That was uncalled for.

That made me feel so much better i\u2019m glad i\u2019m understood!!", "That\u2019s exactly what i said.. i feel like a mother and i don\u2019t even have kids. im raising them for her?", "i\u2019ve been telling her to put them in daycare. i\u2019m done i\u2019m going to be selfish and i don\u2019t care anymore.", "Thank you!

Ungrateful ass", "Thank you. Honestly i\u2019m ready to begin my own path.", "Wow that\u2019s horrible. i\u2019m glad you did what you wanted.

Yes i have a found a good paying job hopefully i get into the university i want and i\u2019ll leave the state all together.", "No amount of money will get me to stay!

Pressuring your own sister to not get a job so you can keep abusing her kindness, does justify getting angry.", "No. Telling someone to turn down a job and framing it like it's for their own benefit, when it's really for yours, is just manipulative.

Sometimes you can even qualify for free daycare", "That is her making a power play by trying to gaslight you into helping her more.
