If you have leftover time, a job for fair pay would give you funding for your next round of school plus a more-rounded college application. \n\nFamily does need to help family, but it is a two way street. \"Helping\" does not mean that one person sacrifices their future in exchange for crumbs just so the other person doesn't have to bother fulfilling their own responsibilities.

Plenty of *single* women take care of their children without relying entirely on underpaid childcare from their younger sisters.

Being the younger sis shouldn't autimatically make you the babysitter.  Tell your sis to pay you minimum wage or $15 dollars an hour.  If she's not willing to pay you properly for your time that's on her.", "She makes 1mill a year for reference. Okay and that\u2019s not a lot of money lol Not ideal to have a maid and what not for 1 mil. Her kids are 5 and 2 meaning one of them is in school. After schools out she calls me to babysit. She doesn\u2019t have \u201ctime\u201d to hire anyone which i think it\u2019s the money she\u2019s not willing to spend. My income depends on my hard work. i have licenses and my work gives lots of money depending how much many deals i close. So i know what i\u2019m talking about lol.", "i\u2019ve had many jobs before\u2026 i\u2019m upset at the fact that she doesnt respect my time. I work two jobs and i\u2019m not new to the working industry.", "All people need to understand your kids are your problem not the whole world....", "You're not being selfish you're telling her off that you're not the third parent or a substitute for day care. You're taking care of yourself.", "OP what\u2019s 7 figures to you? I\u2019m curious because you said your sister\u2019s income buys you nothing in today\u2019s society and you said you will be making over 6 figures in another comment. Making more than 6 figures without a college degree in today\u2019s society is very unlikely.", "It was more of a tell her that because she'll probably be like no anyway", "$1M is not that much a year? \nMath ain\u2019t mathing for sure.", "I\u2019d also like to know. I had to go get my masters to get a decent job haha", "It\u2019s not shit in california. lol Do you even know how the economy runs ?", "You got a 6 figure job coming out of hs? Hmm", "Lol right?? I think OP is working for a sales position and says their job pays over 6 figures, so it depends on what you sell. Base comp is prob very low.", "That is because they\u2019re expensive. The things you listed that you did for her are worth $$$. But why pay what it\u2019s worth when she can Use her sis?  Giving you $100 per week is actually an insult. Nannies work Hard (like you) and it\u2019s a lot of the work nobody really wants to do. Like grocery shopping. I really hate grocery shopping. And let\u2019s face it Kids are WORK. Physical and emotional work. I understand why she wants you to be their caretaker because you are Family. My issue with her is she isn\u2019t willing to Pay you what you\u2019re Worth. When my kids were small their safety and well being were priceless.", "Lol yes, but you don\u2019t seem like you do.", "Lol Y\u2019all act like it\u2019s impossible! I\u2019m doing two jobs one with a license", "Oooh yeah that would make sense. The time is money comments make me think the same.!bingo!", "i even take her kids shopping with me and they always throw fits in the stores. imagine that on top of shopping! like it\u2019s horrible and 100 is definitely chump change", "Maybe it\u2019s a good income yes but some people don\u2019t go the extra mile to put money on things that aren\u2019t necessary. My sister is one of them. Not everyone\u2019s the same hun", "No, that post talks about something that started when they were 16", "\"at the time i (16)\" dude read when you want to correct someone", "We wanna know the job!", "Yeah but OP says that doesn\u2019t buy you much in this economy lmao. $1M apparently doesn\u2019t buy much either.", "Yes it\u2019s an insult to pay you that little for all you do for her. I know about the fit throwing too. When mine were small if they did that we would just leave. I didn\u2019t take them really until they could behave lol. Put your foot down and tell her No. Also show her how much just regular sitters charge. Then add on what else you do. Ofc she\u2019s going to call you selfish. It\u2019s the cool thing to do these days. If any other family members want to chime in on her side just say, \u201c oh good. You can have the job. I\u2019ll let sister know.\u201d  That will shut them up. \ud83e\udd23", "Lol maybe? Lol it\u2019s not about being the same hun. It\u2019s about the lifestyle that it buys you.", "dropshipping and i\u2019m an health and life insurance agent for my own company. If y\u2019all need insurance lmk", "Lol Not everyone who makes money has maids and idk what ur on about. Like i said, she doesn\u2019t put the time to find people to hire so she relies on me.", "People who make $1m a year (and you\u2019re only mentioning your sister\u2019s income not your BILs income) just have a very different lifestyle than what you\u2019re mentioning. But sure, your sister gives you $100 a week which is pocket change for her lol. Your story sounds fishy and the more you explain, the fishier it sounds."]}
