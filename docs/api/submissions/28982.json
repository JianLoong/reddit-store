But honestly I\u2019m concerned for the safety of your toddler. In generally cutlery on the floor over night and a parent that would use it (presumably it was already used on who knows what food) is a red flag for unsanitary loving conditions. Your teenager is one thing\u2026 I\u2019ve got my own and their incompetence is partially hormonal\u2026 but your husband couldn\u2019t be bothered to pick it up last night when it fell there? That\u2019s some absolute bull. It would have taken 10 seconds to wash it quick. As a grown adult, his incompetence is intentional and blaming you for \u201chim never doing anything right\u201d is abusive. He knew darn well he didn\u2019t do that right.", "This is called weaponised incompetence", "NTA\n\nWho raised this person?  There are a lot of red flags here.", "NTA.\n\nDoing something differently would be putting jelly on the toast instead of butter. Picking a knife up off the ground and using it is just disgusting. Are you sure you have only one toddler? Because it sounds more like you have three.\n\nIt's not that difficult to wash dishes, or even just rinse them off before you use them. You have no idea what kind of germs might be living on the floor that you could transfer onto your food.", "Sounds like a straight up arsehole. Run for the wind lass", "NTA he\u2019s using weaponized incompetence to get you to do things he\u2019s fully capable of doing but wanting you to take over. \u201cDoing things differently\u201d is buttering the toast in a different way or adding different toppings. He keeps doing it because he knows he will get away with it and you will keep making up for it because you\u2019re a good parent. You need to sit him down and tell him it\u2019s not that he\u2019s doing it how you don\u2019t like, but the way he\u2019s doing things are not completed and really half assed but you need to tell him why.", "NTA, that\u2019s disgusting", "NTA He needs to quite with his bs and stop acting like a child who doesn't know any better. Your his wife not his mother.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s common sense not to pick a knife off the floor and use it to butter toast without even wiping it.\n\nThis is weaponised incompetence, and it\u2019s pathetic on his part.", "NTA.  Any 29yr old functioning adult should know you don't pick a dish off a dirty floor and use it.  Would take 5 seconds to clean that knife.\n\nThe workload in your home is unbalanced when one person is doing all the chores for a whole family.  Your teen and spouse need to step up, but more so, your spouse.  You work full time on top of everything and will burn out eventually if things don't change. Seems everyone is used to Mom doing it all, so they need to learn some new routines.  They won't like it, but stick to your guns.", "I couldn\u2019t get past the point where you have knives lying on your floor.", "I\u2019m reeling over here picturing this kitchen and the husband just casually reaching down to the floor under a cabinet for a dirty butter knife that\u2019s been there since last night and actually using it like it\u2019s perfectly normal. \n\nOP you\u2019re NTA but for your child\u2019s health and safety the adults in your house need to get it together and clean up. Is your husband one of the adults? Only OP knows for sure.", "No, the 5 second rule isn\u2019t a thing. It\u2019s just as germy after 5 seconds as it is over night. And your husband apparently stopped maturing in grade school. He should not be caring for a child if he thinks that is ok.", "NTA, you have a toddler and two teenagers at the is point", "NTA. There is nothing wrong with doing things differently when the alterative is reasonable (and unlikely to make your child sick). Yes, leaving a knife on the floor overnight and expecting your toddler to eat off it is unreasonable and totally disgusting.", "The house never should get that dirty. Call a meeting of everyone at home and give each person tasks to be done. \nLaundry, trash, cleaning the floor and bathrooms, vacuuming, loading/ unloading dishwasher should be allocated to a different person every week. \nWhy on earth are you doing the bulk of the work? Everyone who lives in the house has to contribute. \nStop being dumb and share all the chores. \nIf Your teenager refuses, take away their phone/ electronics. \nThere\u2019s consequences for every behavior. \nCommunicate in a calm manner with your spouse. \n\nESH", "ESH. I can\u2019t get over the fact that you just have knives on the floor. Wow.", "That\u2019s not gaslighting. Please use the correct words. He is lazy. NTA", "ESH. You clearly don\u2019t know what gas lighting means.", "ESH.\n\nSounds pretty gross by the dad.\n\nDad probably feels like \u201cdamned if I do, damned if I don\u2019t\u201d. \n\nMaybe you should of approached the situation more kindly. Something like, \u201cthanks for making the toast but using a knife off the floor is not acceptable\u201d\n\nSounds like the dad needs to learn basic cleaning skills. \n\nSounds like there\u2019s contempt in the marriage; basing that over how you two for so upset at each other so quickly. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t see how this is an example of gaslighting at all.

Not advised, but that it upset you this much says that you are the ass here, and your husband would have a different take on the events in question.", "ESH\n\nUsing cutlery off the floor isn't a good practice but probably won't kill anyone. He has a good point that if you ask someone to do something then let them do it. It would have been great if you could have given him some positive reinforcement around this, now that chance is lost.\n\nSounds like you two are not communicating well and would benefit from some couples counseling.", "Oh come on people.  That little bit of what ever that butter knife picked up isn\u2019t going to hurt the toddler.
