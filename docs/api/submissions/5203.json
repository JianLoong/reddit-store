(My older cousin is getting a console for Christmas as they had to share one for the last few years.)    \n\nHe likes to play rust and he doesn't have Xbox live in order to play it so a few months back I turned my home Xbox on his console so he could play it.\n\n Well after the 30 minutes he told us that it because he didnt want too after he got on at 6 am and continued to play passed 3:30 pm when (we wanted to hop on).\n\nI then told him if you don't let us hop on I'll just remove my home Xbox which I was going to do in a week either way, when I said that he just said I don't really care. So I removed it and he got mad and cried to him mom saying i took it away from him without a reason. \n\n His mom called my mom informed her of what I did and they called me an asshole so I explained it to both of them and my aunt said that's fair but my uncle heard what happened and got pissed and threatened me by saying i cannot not speak to my cousins again so AITA?", "created_utc": 1671529129, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqk6x0/aita_for_removing_my_home_xbox_from_my_cousin/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then you made sure to remind him that in an 1 hour you would start play so he needed to log off. He didn't and asked for more time, so for a second time you agreed to give more time to your cousin to finish.  When he didn't you stated the  you would take off it's access, which you did and was already planning to do, so I think he was aware that when your cousin got his console you would log off from there. In the end I think the only asshole is your uncle which doesn't understand that you gave your cousin enough time to finish playing and save his progress. \nNTA all the way, I advise to talk to your mom and/or aunt to ask to explain the reality to your uncle, even better if the older cousin is there as well to back you up.", "NTA.\n\nThis is how I read the basic parts of the wall of text.\n\nYour younger cousin was aware that you were going to use your Xbox at 15:30 and had been playing on it since 06:00 but failed to leave it. \n\nHe was using your Xbox subscription, so you warned him he would lose access but still remained playing.\n\nYou took his access away and he started crying, his family supports him but your family supports you. \n\nYou did give enough time and opportunity for younger cousin to give way but he refused and he received exactly what you promised and delivered. \n\nIf your Uncle wants to not listen to the full story, then there is nothing you can do but know you took an appropriate course of actions.", "NTA. But I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree if that's how your uncle would react to his son being the instigator and getting in the way of your plans despite giving him extra time.", "NTA\n\nIts your stuff and if he doesnt want to respect what you scheduled in advance he doesnt need to use it.\n\nAlso your uncle sounds batshit insane for saying you cant speak to people over if someone is allowed to play videogames or not.", "NTA; your cousin sounds like that kid that blows out the birthday kid\u2019s candle on their cake.", "NTA, you did the right thing. Sounds like your little cousin needs some help too if he's playing video games for 9+ hours a day. You just turned off his crack", "He was playing from *6 am until 3.30 pm*??? Holy shit. Get that kid off the damn Xbox.", "NTA a 12 yo who is on from 6 am to 330 pm, and then cries to mommy when the console owner wants a turn has some serious issues, as does his mom", "NTA score! On what uncle said", "NTA.\n\nYou gave him a schedule, and he refused to honor it.\n\nIt's your Xbox", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
