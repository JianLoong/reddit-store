But you need to be straight with her. Tell her that you cannot accommodate his needs, you are still trying to replace things that were broken the last visit. It's understandable you don't want her or him to feel bad but you have every right to not have broken furniture. It's also a safety concern for him, he could  potentially be injured when the furniture or toilet breaks.", "Oooooof. Okay first the title is very misleading. He is not overweight. He is EXTREMELY obese. \nHonestly, I wouldn\u2019t want him to visit either. It\u2019s not like you just don\u2019t like fat people or something. He literally broke your property, even if it was unintentional. \nI definitely think you should tell your friend because it is not like you can just magically replace things he breaks with a limited budget. \nIf they both want to visit then they really need to get a local hotel or something. \nBut no you are NTA. \nI get feeling bad but like I said you\u2019re not actually focused on the weight and he is not just overweight. You have a right to not want your property damaged or destroyed to accommodate a single person.\nEdited for grammar.", "i'm not sure HOW you explain you don't want him to come without offending them. but you're NTA -- he's damaging your property and not replacing it.\n\ndoes he have a suitable chair or something they could bring ?", "NTA. A surprise visit is not cool at all, and very much a thoughtless imposition. I understand not wanting to hurt your friend\u2019s feelings. If you know when they\u2019re coming, you and your husband go out of town somewhere and don\u2019t tell anyone about it. It may give your friend some insight about surprises.", "NTA but it sounds like they weren't coming just to see you since you said they were already going to be in the area. So do they have to come to your house? You can't make plans with them to meet at a resturant? or something?", "NTA, but I fully understand that is an awful situation to be in. I think communicating with your friend openly and honestly would be the right move. You can try and arrange to meet at a restaurant or something this time, but what about future times? I think you just need to have an open and honest conversation and hope it goes well. There's not much more you can do. You aren't doing anything wrong by trying to protect your home and property as long as you are doing it in the nicest way possible. Again, it's a horrible situation and I wish you all the luck.", "NTA. Can your husband arrange it so that you\u2019re meeting them somewhere\u2014or do they expect to come to/stay at your place?", "That\u2019s such a bad situations but you are NTA \n\nMaybe ask them if you can meet somewhere for lunch or dinner when they are in the area instead of meeting them at your house?", "NTA that kind of size is difficult to accommodate. I'm sure it's hard and embarrassing for him but it's your home. You deserve to have your things not broken or smelly. I'm sure he is aware of his size and he should be aware of the smell and issues with furniture and toilets. He should know to be prepared when staying at someone else's home.", "NTA and just tell them things are too hectic in your household and ask that they stay in a hotel.", "So they didn\u2019t pay to replace your stuff (which they should have). Did your friend wash him after you asked her to? I think you\u2019re 100% valid to not want him over at your house. NTA.", "NTA This is a sensitive subject, but your belongings are being damaged so something needs to be said. I just find it hard to believe that neither of them understood that he broke your couch, for example. Like, you notice when you break something! \n\nI think the best thing to do is to be honest about the damage her husband did to your home, and that it would be best to meet outside of the home in the future. There's a high possibility of them being hurt, but I don't see any other option here.", "NTA you literally don\u2019t have the money to replace stuff. Like you have no choice but to say no. Is she expecting to surprise you and stay with you without asking? Unfortunately I think you might have to just be super straight forward:( make sure you verify her husband can\u2019t hear before you talk to her about it", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The unfortunate thing is this is her husband somebody you said is a great guy. And even with the best of intention she's going to feel like you're insulting him and it may wreck your friendship. Sometimes we have to find ways out of situations to avoid hurting people's feelings. Maybe you should just state that your house is going to be fumigated that day or there's going to be some work done water heater went out anything and you guys can meet in a public place like a restaurant have them stay at a hotel meet at the hotel something like that. If you were concerned about his health and that's why you wanted to talk to her I might have said this a little differently, but you never once said you were concerned about his health you were only concerned about your stuff being broken. This is why I'm saying don't bring it up to your friend because that's how she's going to see it as well as you only care about your stuff.", "NTA\n\nI don't see how they didn't know he broke the couch in the first place? I mean when you break something, it's pretty obvious. \n\nThis needs to be handled gently as you don't want to hurt feelings, but at the same time, they're aware of his obesity too. They know it causes issues, and there's no way they aren't' aware of the damage he left behind at your house.", "NTA. It's unfortunate you're being forced to have a conversation about things your friend should already recognize. Her husband is careless about other people's homes & has awful hygiene. I'm guessing he can't fit in a normal bath or shower, so he got worse after a few days at your place.\n\nThe idea that they can invite themselves in on a \"surprise trip\" is a huge problem. Even aside from the other issues, you don't assume someone is going to put you up for the night without asking.", "Just say that with it being the holidays things are hectic and you're really busy. Make plans to meet at a restaurant or some kind of holiday outing. If the trip isn't specifically to see you and she's just going to be in the area is she expecting to stay with you? If so just say it's not a good time and make reservations at a hotel.", "Your home cannot accommodate him. Tell her that. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, I wish I could house you guys and allow these visits but my home is not equip for your husband to stay here\u201d", "If your husband knows they\u2019re coming, could he possibly let them know that you have family or other friends staying with you already? And maybe you can plan a day out doing an activity instead?", "NTA. But honesty is the best policy IMO. \nMaybe explain to her that after his last visit, you had to replace items that you just cannot afford to. Perhaps they could stay at a hotel?", "NTA. I've been in a similar situation and I had serious damage at the house I was renting too, they didn't pay and I never invited them over again. As harsh as it might be, don't invite them if they can't pay for any damage. You think too much of it while they don't think any of it. Be honest and let it flow.", "NTA, this is really sad. Your best friend is losing her husband to a slow suicide. I'm sure she doesn't know what to do or how to help her husband but maybe the stark reality of the truth would help both of them. Write down what you most want to say but with all the gentleness and care I know you can. If you find this too difficult to deliver over the phone write a letter. Explain why they can't visit, that you just can't afford the loss  of your furniture. \n\nI know this is a delicate subject and you don't have to raise it but his weight will not only be the end of him but of their social life. This is not just a lack of control on his part, this is a serious eating disorder. Is there a way you can assist them in getting some help or has this all been discussed before?\n\nStill, your family and home are your first priority, tell your friend the situation as you see it and that you care about both of them. Ask if there is anything you can do to help.", "I feel for you, OP. What a difficult situation. I understand completely why you wouldn\u2019t want him around, purely because of the (horribly disgusting) hygiene problems. \n\nI hope you find a way to talk about this with your friend. In my opinion, your only way would be honesty. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, I had a similar situation and it's sooooo hard. I ended up saying nothing and just distancing myself from said friend, which sucked, but that's what I did. Best of luck with your decision.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTell them there are nice hotels around, butthey can not stay with you. If necessary, ccite the damage from last time. They have not paid for it, have they?", "Damn, I would plan a quick getaway.  This sucks for you!", "NTA. Just be honest.", "Nta. Dude I thought this was guy was like 5'9 and 200lbs or something similar.\n\nThis guy isn't overweight. He is *morbidly obese*.\n\nHe broke your stuff, caused things to smell, and just generally messed up your house without trying to fix anything. Youre not saying he can't come over because he's obese. You're saying he can't come because he disrespectfully trashes your house.", "So surprise trip doesn\u2019t mean you meed to accommodate them. \n\n\nNTA", "Should I just tell her my fiance told me about the surprise? And we talked about it? And maybe come up with a plan on how to accommodate him? I keep trying to think of how to even begin honestly.", "I agree.  OP, tell your friend that you've had to replace your couch and toilet seats.  If he wants to visit, he needs to bring his own chair, that you don't have anything that can accommodate him.  Even better if they stay at a hotel and your visit each other in public.\n\nNTA", "I think \"accommodate\" is the appropriate angle here. You are not equipped to accommodate his needs and you cannot afford the cost to do so. If you had a friend who was a wheelchair user but your house had stairs at all of the entry points it would be great if you could build a ramp to accommodate them, but building a safe and secure ramp is often not in the budget for most people for a single visit. Likewise you cannot afford a sturdier toilet, a new couch, etc., especially since they did nothing to warn you ahead of time or compensate you for the losses you incurred last visit.", "Agree, well said.", "He brought it last time and I asked him to sit in this chair I don't mind being broken but he still sat on the couch. We had to put books under it until we got a new one. I also don't want money or anything I just don't want my stuff broken.", "We talk about his health a lot. It's part of our regular conversation. I'm not worried he's going to have a heart attack at my house, I'm worried for my new things.", "It really is sooo hard. Sorry you've gone through something similar. I tried distancing myself a bit after their last visit but she really is my best friend it hurt way too much trying to", "I don't want them to pay for it. I didn't even talk to her about the damage. They don't have a lot of money either. But I don't want this to keep happening.", "I think this is a good aporoach. His wife knows his condition & he does too. Chances are their own furniture has been broken or they buy reinforced items. Could they stay in a hotel? \nYou are being thoughtful, not reactive.", "Maybe talk with your fiance first and figure out a way to handle the conversation.\n\nI don't think accommodating him is a realistic option at this point. Standard furniture is simply not built to handle that much weight, especially in the more affordable price range. The static weight might of a piece might say 800 pounds but has a much lower dynamic weight limit. (as in someone getting on or off the furniture. Furniture specifically designed for obese people costs significantly more than your run of the mill furniture. And often needs to be special ordered. For example, I was looking at recliners not too long ago and a recliner rated for 250 pounds was about $300, a  recliner rated for around 400 pounds same place same brand  recliner was almost $700. The regular reclner was in stock, the other one had a wait time of a few weeks. Finding a toilet that is designed for that weight might entail making changes to the plumbing and bathroom structure.", "If you care about this woman and your friendship, you\u2019re going to have to have an uncomfortable conversation with her. It\u2019s not going to be pleasant for either of you, but hopefully you feel that your friendship is worth it. And you just have to be honest. Keep in mind that your home is not the only place where he encounters difficulties because of his size. \n\nKeep it factual and remove any sense of judgment. Tell her how much you love her and how much you enjoy her company. And hopefully you can honestly tell her that you enjoy her husband as a person as well. Tell her that after their visit, you incurred expenses to replace things, and you are still dealing with plumbing that isn\u2019t working correctly. And that while you love them, your house isn\u2019t set up to accommodate someone of his size. I\u2019d probably leave the smelliness out of it just because that can be such a difficult difficult thing to discuss.\n\nTell her that as much as you care about her, your house just can\u2019t accommodate him as a guest.\n\nNTA", "I don't think you can accommodate him sadly. This is just going to have to be a tough but necessary conversation, especially if you want this relationship for the long haul.  She already knows what he's doing to your house but does she offer to try and make it easier on you? She knows but seems to think you should have to put up with it. There is NO WAY she does not see what he is doing to your house and his lack of cleanliness. SHE KNOWS BUT STILL PUTS YOU IN THIS POSITION! I'm not sure what you need to say to her at this point other than to ask point blank why she is allowing him to behave this way in your home. I see a serious lack of respect on her part :(", "only go out to other places, don\u2019t invite them in. since it\u2019s a \u201csurprise\u201d visit just be like no you can\u2019t come in, my house is a mess. do they expect to stay with you???", "I'm imagining this:\n\n\"Whoa there, big guy! The house might be made of bricks, but that chair is particle board Ikea crap and it's missing hardware. IDK how homeowners insurance really works but let's not find out lol\"\n\nETA: NTA", "Ugh I had a similar experience with a close family member fairly recently. It's a really tough situation, especially if (like us) you're in a small space and can't accommodate different furniture.", "I think it's okay to make it about you and your stuff. You don't have to beat around the bush and feelings, when he is damaging your property.", "Smell ones too. Somebody has to say something. Plumbing isn\u2019t working right and it took a week and Loya of product to air out that house. She may not smell it anymore, but she needs to be aware. It is not ok to pollute someone\u2019s space like that especially out of nowhere.", "What did you do about it? We are also in a small space, we bought our home mostly for the land. Our bedroom is the attic, there's 2 bedrooms on the main floor and the basement has a small finished room with the rest being unfinished. We are currently in the process of removing some furniture to make more space. We can't fit a Christmas tree as is.", "Honestly, my husband was grumpy about it but I was too embarrassed to say anything/ wasn't sure it was a good idea. The larger person in question is a teenager and a couch didn't seem worth potentially their self confidence for the rest of their life. But it wasn't as big a thing as what you're going through- I'm talking about a large teenage boy not knowing when not to flop, not a morbidly obese adult man actively breaking furniture they've been asked not to sit on. In your case I think you just need to be upfront, they clearly don't take hints or even outright instructions."]}
