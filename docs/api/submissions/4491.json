We have two kids. This was our dream, we were both poor growing up so having a house of our own was a huge deal for us. When we moved in we threw a housewarming party and I invited my best friend of 10+ years over to stay. She lives about 2 hours away now and we rarely get to see each other. \n\nI lover her and her husband so much. I can tell her anything and she can trust me with anything. She's truly my best friend. We can not talk for months and start talking again like we last spoke yesterday. She's one of the best people I've ever met. A truly rare type of person. So this situation is tearing me up inside. I know I can be honest with her and it would be ok and somehow I still can't bring myself to tell her how I feel. \n\nHer husband refuses to take care of himself and I don't know what to do. When they stayed for a few days for my housewarming party it was awesome having him, he's a good guy and great with my kids. But he's around 600lbs. I could be wrong, he could be closer to 500 but it affects his mobility and his ability to wash himself. After a few days of staying with us, he smelled SO bad. I had to ask my friend if she would ask him to wash down or shower. My furniture smelled bad. His feet had think crust that flaked off everywhere. He also broke a decorative metal chair (it was rusting I was going to vine flowers through it) when he tried to sit in it and broke our couch. And our toilet seat and the toilet doesn't sit right anymore it's loose. We had to get a new couch. We live on one income because I'm disabled. I didn't say anything about the broken stuff because they also live on one income and I felt embarrassed to say anything. They rarely visit because of distance and money so in my mind, not a big deal. \n\nMy husband just told me they are planning a surprise trip. They are already going to be in the area so I can't ask it to just be a girls trip. I literally don't know what to do. I feel like the asshole.\n\nEDIT TO ADD:\n\nI don't believe they are staying the night. I read the message she sent my fiance and it sounds like they are just stopping by since they will be in the area. So asking them to get a hotel isn't an option. So I have to either host them in my home and be honest with her and try to accommodate him or try to get my fiance to come up with a plan to meet up at a restaurant or something. There isn't a lot to do around here and we both don't have a lot of money especially with the holidays. It's supposed to be something nice to surprise me because I'm a disabled SAHM who doesn't get out much and doesn't have many friends. WHICH MAKES ME FEEL WORSE about saying anything. She's trying to do something nice for me and I have to say something about her husband breaking my shit. The consensus seems to be I'm NTA so far but I still just feel like the biggest a-hole to exist.", "created_utc": 1670779729, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zj0oxm/aita_for_not_wanting_my_overweight_friend_to_come/", "score": 339, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's also a safety concern for him, he could  potentially be injured when the furniture or toilet breaks.", "Oooooof. Okay first the title is very misleading. He is not overweight. He is EXTREMELY obese. \nHonestly, I wouldn\u2019t want him to visit either. It\u2019s not like you just don\u2019t like fat people or something. He literally broke your property, even if it was unintentional. \nI definitely think you should tell your friend because it is not like you can just magically replace things he breaks with a limited budget. \nIf they both want to visit then they really need to get a local hotel or something. \nBut no you are NTA. \nI get feeling bad but like I said you\u2019re not actually focused on the weight and he is not just overweight.

A surprise visit is not cool at all, and very much a thoughtless imposition. I understand not wanting to hurt your friend\u2019s feelings.

It may give your friend some insight about surprises.", "NTA but it sounds like they weren't coming just to see you since you said they were already going to be in the area. So do they have to come to your house? You can't make plans with them to meet at a resturant? or something?", "NTA, but I fully understand that is an awful situation to be in. I think communicating with your friend openly and honestly would be the right move. You can try and arrange to meet at a restaurant or something this time, but what about future times? I think you just need to have an open and honest conversation and hope it goes well. There's not much more you can do. You aren't doing anything wrong by trying to protect your home and property as long as you are doing it in the nicest way possible. Again, it's a horrible situation and I wish you all the luck.", "NTA. Can your husband arrange it so that you\u2019re meeting them somewhere\u2014or do they expect to come to/stay at your place?", "That\u2019s such a bad situations but you are NTA \n\nMaybe ask them if you can meet somewhere for lunch or dinner when they are in the area instead of meeting them at your house?", "NTA that kind of size is difficult to accommodate. I'm sure it's hard and embarrassing for him but it's your home. You deserve to have your things not broken or smelly. I'm sure he is aware of his size and he should be aware of the smell and issues with furniture and toilets. He should know to be prepared when staying at someone else's home.", "NTA and just tell them things are too hectic in your household and ask that they stay in a hotel.", "So they didn\u2019t pay to replace your stuff (which they should have). Did your friend wash him after you asked her to? I think you\u2019re 100% valid to not want him over at your house. NTA.", "NTA This is a sensitive subject, but your belongings are being damaged so something needs to be said. I just find it hard to believe that neither of them understood that he broke your couch, for example. Like, you notice when you break something! \n\nI think the best thing to do is to be honest about the damage her husband did to your home, and that it would be best to meet outside of the home in the future. There's a high possibility of them being hurt, but I don't see any other option here.", "NTA you literally don\u2019t have the money to replace stuff. Like you have no choice but to say no.

The unfortunate thing is this is her husband somebody you said is a great guy. And even with the best of intention she's going to feel like you're insulting him and it may wreck your friendship. Sometimes we have to find ways out of situations to avoid hurting people's feelings. Maybe you should just state that your house is going to be fumigated that day or there's going to be some work done water heater went out anything and you guys can meet in a public place like a restaurant have them stay at a hotel meet at the hotel something like that. If you were concerned about his health and that's why you wanted to talk to her I might have said this a little differently, but you never once said you were concerned about his health you were only concerned about your stuff being broken. This is why I'm saying don't bring it up to your friend because that's how she's going to see it as well as you only care about your stuff.", "NTA\n\nI don't see how they didn't know he broke the couch in the first place? I mean when you break something, it's pretty obvious. \n\nThis needs to be handled gently as you don't want to hurt feelings, but at the same time, they're aware of his obesity too. They know it causes issues, and there's no way they aren't' aware of the damage he left behind at your house.", "NTA. It's unfortunate you're being forced to have a conversation about things your friend should already recognize. Her husband is careless about other people's homes & has awful hygiene. I'm guessing he can't fit in a normal bath or shower, so he got worse after a few days at your place.\n\nThe idea that they can invite themselves in on a \"surprise trip\" is a huge problem. Even aside from the other issues, you don't assume someone is going to put you up for the night without asking.", "Just say that with it being the holidays things are hectic and you're really busy. Make plans to meet at a restaurant or some kind of holiday outing. If the trip isn't specifically to see you and she's just going to be in the area is she expecting to stay with you? If so just say it's not a good time and make reservations at a hotel.", "Your home cannot accommodate him. Tell her that. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, I wish I could house you guys and allow these visits but my home is not equip for your husband to stay here\u201d", "If your husband knows they\u2019re coming, could he possibly let them know that you have family or other friends staying with you already? And maybe you can plan a day out doing an activity instead?", "NTA. But honesty is the best policy IMO. \nMaybe explain to her that after his last visit, you had to replace items that you just cannot afford to. Perhaps they could stay at a hotel?", "NTA. I've been in a similar situation and I had serious damage at the house I was renting too, they didn't pay and I never invited them over again. As harsh as it might be, don't invite them if they can't pay for any damage. You think too much of it while they don't think any of it. Be honest and let it flow.", "NTA, this is really sad. Your best friend is losing her husband to a slow suicide. I'm sure she doesn't know what to do or how to help her husband but maybe the stark reality of the truth would help both of them. Write down what you most want to say but with all the gentleness and care I know you can. If you find this too difficult to deliver over the phone write a letter. Explain why they can't visit, that you just can't afford the loss  of your furniture. \n\nI know this is a delicate subject and you don't have to raise it but his weight will not only be the end of him but of their social life. This is not just a lack of control on his part, this is a serious eating disorder. Is there a way you can assist them in getting some help or has this all been discussed before?\n\nStill, your family and home are your first priority, tell your friend the situation as you see it and that you care about both of them. Ask if there is anything you can do to help.", "I feel for you, OP. What a difficult situation. I understand completely why you wouldn\u2019t want him around, purely because of the (horribly disgusting) hygiene problems. \n\nI hope you find a way to talk about this with your friend. In my opinion, your only way would be honesty. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, I had a similar situation and it's sooooo hard. I ended up saying nothing and just distancing myself from said friend, which sucked, but that's what I did. Best of luck with your decision.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTell them there are nice hotels around, butthey can not stay with you. If necessary, ccite the damage from last time. They have not paid for it, have they?", "Damn, I would plan a quick getaway.  This sucks for you!", "NTA. Just be honest.", "Nta. Dude I thought this was guy was like 5'9 and 200lbs or something similar.\n\nThis guy isn't overweight. He is *morbidly obese*.\n\nHe broke your stuff, caused things to smell, and just generally messed up your house without trying to fix anything. Youre not saying he can't come over because he's obese. You're saying he can't come because he disrespectfully trashes your house.", "So surprise trip doesn\u2019t mean you meed to accommodate them. \n\n\nNTA", "Should I just tell her my fiance told me about the surprise? And we talked about it? And maybe come up with a plan on how to accommodate him? I keep trying to think of how to even begin honestly.", "I agree.  OP, tell your friend that you've had to replace your couch and toilet seats.  If he wants to visit, he needs to bring his own chair, that you don't have anything that can accommodate him.  Even better if they stay at a hotel and your visit each other in public.\n\nNTA", "I think \"accommodate\" is the appropriate angle here. You are not equipped to accommodate his needs and you cannot afford the cost to do so. If you had a friend who was a wheelchair user but your house had stairs at all of the entry points it would be great if you could build a ramp to accommodate them, but building a safe and secure ramp is often not in the budget for most people for a single visit. Likewise you cannot afford a sturdier toilet, a new couch, etc., especially since they did nothing to warn you ahead of time or compensate you for the losses you incurred last visit.", "Agree, well said.", "He brought it last time and I asked him to sit in this chair I don't mind being broken but he still sat on the couch. We had to put books under it until we got a new one. I also don't want money or anything I just don't want my stuff broken.", "We talk about his health a lot. It's part of our regular conversation. I'm not worried he's going to have a heart attack at my house, I'm worried for my new things.", "It really is sooo hard. Sorry you've gone through something similar. I tried distancing myself a bit after their last visit but she really is my best friend it hurt way too much trying to", "I don't want them to pay for it. I didn't even talk to her about the damage. They don't have a lot of money either. But I don't want this to keep happening.", "I think this is a good aporoach. His wife knows his condition & he does too. Chances are their own furniture has been broken or they buy reinforced items. Could they stay in a hotel? \nYou are being thoughtful, not reactive.", "Maybe talk with your fiance first and figure out a way to handle the conversation.\n\nI don't think accommodating him is a realistic option at this point. Standard furniture is simply not built to handle that much weight, especially in the more affordable price range. The static weight might of a piece might say 800 pounds but has a much lower dynamic weight limit. (as in someone getting on or off the furniture. Furniture specifically designed for obese people costs significantly more than your run of the mill furniture. And often needs to be special ordered. For example, I was looking at recliners not too long ago and a recliner rated for 250 pounds was about $300, a  recliner rated for around 400 pounds same place same brand  recliner was almost $700. The regular reclner was in stock, the other one had a wait time of a few weeks. Finding a toilet that is designed for that weight might entail making changes to the plumbing and bathroom structure.", "If you care about this woman and your friendship, you\u2019re going to have to have an uncomfortable conversation with her. It\u2019s not going to be pleasant for either of you, but hopefully you feel that your friendship is worth it. And you just have to be honest. Keep in mind that your home is not the only place where he encounters difficulties because of his size. \n\nKeep it factual and remove any sense of judgment. Tell her how much you love her and how much you enjoy her company. And hopefully you can honestly tell her that you enjoy her husband as a person as well. Tell her that after their visit, you incurred expenses to replace things, and you are still dealing with plumbing that isn\u2019t working correctly. And that while you love them, your house isn\u2019t set up to accommodate someone of his size. I\u2019d probably leave the smelliness out of it just because that can be such a difficult difficult thing to discuss.\n\nTell her that as much as you care about her, your house just can\u2019t accommodate him as a guest.\n\nNTA", "I don't think you can accommodate him sadly. This is just going to have to be a tough but necessary conversation, especially if you want this relationship for the long haul.  She already knows what he's doing to your house but does she offer to try and make it easier on you? She knows but seems to think you should have to put up with it. There is NO WAY she does not see what he is doing to your house and his lack of cleanliness. SHE KNOWS BUT STILL PUTS YOU IN THIS POSITION! I'm not sure what you need to say to her at this point other than to ask point blank why she is allowing him to behave this way in your home. I see a serious lack of respect on her part :(", "only go out to other places, don\u2019t invite them in. since it\u2019s a \u201csurprise\u201d visit just be like no you can\u2019t come in, my house is a mess. do they expect to stay with you???", "I'm imagining this:\n\n\"Whoa there, big guy! The house might be made of bricks, but that chair is particle board Ikea crap and it's missing hardware. IDK how homeowners insurance really works but let's not find out lol\"\n\nETA: NTA", "Ugh I had a similar experience with a close family member fairly recently. It's a really tough situation, especially if (like us) you're in a small space and can't accommodate different furniture.", "I think it's okay to make it about you and your stuff. You don't have to beat around the bush and feelings, when he is damaging your property.", "Smell ones too. Somebody has to say something. Plumbing isn\u2019t working right and it took a week and Loya of product to air out that house. She may not smell it anymore, but she needs to be aware. It is not ok to pollute someone\u2019s space like that especially out of nowhere.", "What did you do about it? We are also in a small space, we bought our home mostly for the land. Our bedroom is the attic, there's 2 bedrooms on the main floor and the basement has a small finished room with the rest being unfinished. We are currently in the process of removing some furniture to make more space. We can't fit a Christmas tree as is.", "Honestly, my husband was grumpy about it but I was too embarrassed to say anything/ wasn't sure it was a good idea. The larger person in question is a teenager and a couch didn't seem worth potentially their self confidence for the rest of their life. But it wasn't as big a thing as what you're going through- I'm talking about a large teenage boy not knowing when not to flop, not a morbidly obese adult man actively breaking furniture they've been asked not to sit on. In your case I think you just need to be upfront, they clearly don't take hints or even outright instructions.", "NTA For real he recognized that he broke the stuff. And to not even offer to pay for it after you broke it, is so shitty. Now they want to visit you again. And planned as a surprise, so that you can't say \"no\"? I would feel so ashamed to come again after i broke the stuff. And your best friend should feel also ashamed. Shd knows you have no money and two kids but brongs her husband that doesn't wash himself and has crusty feets and breaks your stuff!? Why are you afraid to hurt their feelings? They clearly give a fuck about you! Otherwise they would have felt so bad about everything and did some self-reflection. You try to walk on egg-shells while they stomp on them.", "NTA. I say this as someone who once was nearly 200 kilo. With family members and friends who are around that weight or higher: you are Not an asshole for saying you cannot accommodate him because of his weight and related issues. \n\nReinforced furniture is Expensive af. And nobody not rich can afford to replace furniture every time they\u2019ve had guests. \n\nReaching to wash can be near to impossible when you are Big, and sweat will pool in folds quicker and smell. But there are so so many tools and options to help with that. It\u2019s completely on the person to keep clean and bring the tools to do so, or heck get their so to help them. \n\n\nTell it to them kindly and openly. That you love them and very much want them in your life but your home simply aren\u2019t equipped to handle a person of that weight class.\nSuggest you come to them instead, or if you have the skill perhaps look into reinforcing some of your furniture yourself and measly mention the sent issue.", "NTA but I\u2019m going to say that you can be morbidly obese and not smell.  Like, being fat doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be clean.  Being disabled doesn\u2019t prevent you from being clean.  You might need *help* if you can\u2019t bend or reach or something, but choosing not to ask for it and just make people around you put up with it is an AH move.  \n\nSource: I am disabled and morbidly obese, though not to this extreme. \n\n(Obviously this is different for people who are all alone and have no one to help, but he has a spouse to help.   If he\u2019s too proud to ask, that is not your problem.)", "NTA but you have to talk to her. It's not fair on you to have more furniture destroyed. And if he gets injured you could be liable. \n\nAlso im annoyed on your behalf. They know he's obese. They have to know that he broke furniture and they didn't offer to pay you. That's honestly shitty of your supposed best friend.", "It's such a shame that you are going to be out of town when they are around.  NTA", "NTA, your title really doesn't match the situation. The issue is that not only is he incredibly obese, he also has poor hygiene, and it's not just a visit, they would be expecting a stay.\n\nYou do not have the ability to host your friend because of her husband, and you need to address it immediately. Because I get that you don't want to lose a friend, but she isn't a good friend if she's planning a surprise trip to drop in on you, and expect you to be a host. I don't understand why you ate the costs from his previous trip, but it's disrespectful that she brought her husband around when his hygiene is that bad", "If he uses your toilets be sure to replace the seals because he probably compressed them to the point that they no longer function. This happened at my house when an obese person visited. I got in the habit of changing them immediately after the visit.", "NTA Do you live somewhere warm? Can you propose an outdoor picnic?", "NTA", "You can tighten the seat again. On the toilet.\n\nTotally easy fix.", "Say you have covid and can't entertain any visitors.\n\nNTA", "[removed]", "NTA. \n\nIt's not that he's overweight- he's obese to the point that he's practically disabled. You can't accommodate him properly and you need to say that to him. My spouse is overweight/obese due to a mobility issue, but he is still able to shower daily and doesn't break chairs (he did break a toilet seat once, but not by sitting on it). \n\nYou need to be honest with your friend and say you can't accommodate him. It may hurt, but it's going to have to happen.", "NTA. \n\nBut maybe she can surprise you in a PARK! \n\nYou need to ask them to replace the couch, toilet and seat. I mean he knows he broke them right!", "My sister\u2019s FIL was like this and my sister literally cried every time he came to visit. She had to get rid of the recliner he sat in and she said she would bring him fresh towels every day but they were never used. The hygiene thing is bad. It ended up literally killing her FIL because he got gangrene from not washing himself. I know this is going to be the most difficult thing you\u2019ve ever done but it needs to be done. I can tell you\u2019re a sweet person and worried about hurt feelings but I think you can do this. NTA at all.", "Growing up my dad had a friend who was this large, 500ish lbs from what I remember. He broke our pull out couch when he stayed over. Pretty sure that was the last time he stayed over. They stayed friends but my parents explained that we just couldn't host him. He was ok. It probably stung to hear but he was well aware of his weight and didn't get mad. I will say that he never smelled or was gross. He was single so he didn't have anyone helping him as far as I know, but he managed to stay on top of hygiene.", "Getting a hotel is good but... I can see where OP wouldn't want this person over *at all.* just a regular visit requires sitting on the couch and probably using the toilet and that runs the risk of him breaking it again.\n\nHonestly, she should talk to her friend and ask that they hang out elsewhere that can accommodate OP's disability. It really sucks to not have the comfort of home, but the cost of all this broken furniture isn't really worth it. She needs to let her friend know the reality of the situation and figure out how to work with it.\n\nI have a lot of empathy for morbidly obese people because they all suffer deeply in a lot of ways, but at the same time they have to respect that they aren't able to do the same things other people can do, and that includes sitting on some furniture and using some accommodations. They need to be respectful of that, even though I'm sure it's devastating and embarrassing.", "I mean they shouldn't be since they didn't arrange it with them. It's incredibly rude to expect to be housed for a visit when you don't even contact those people to let them know you're coming", "The crusty feet. I have a toddler who tries to put everything in his mouth. That's all I'll say. It's been a nightmare of mine. \n\nBut I guess I've been there (not the crust) I was a little over 400lbs before. I understand the toxic relationship with food and being ashamed of yourself. He's at a weight where it's almost impossible to lose now that he's practically immobile. I don't want to make him feel worse than he does if I can avoid it. I have just been in a situation where I've broken a plastic lawn chair or two and wanted to disappear. He broke that metal chair and FLATTENED it. He almost cried I mean he felt SO bad. So I never brought up the toilet or couch. But these are expensive things to replace and I know if I keep letting it go, it'll just keep happening and I'll dread every visit instead of looking forward to seeing my closest friend.", "It's so hard because it's honestly something we discuss a lot. It's affecting her life, their sex life too. When they married he was overweight but over time he's just gained until now he's almost immobile. He has to get knee injections so he can walk without a lot of pain. So he's gotten to a point where he can't even exercise to lose weight. She's tried everything but she can't force him. He's in his thirties and every time we talk I gently try to bring up how risky his weight is especially at his age and give ideas on how to help. I used to be 400lbs and lost over 220. I have had issues with my own weight and it's fluctuates especially after having kids. So I'll never be mean or judge someone based on weight and I know how hard it is to lose weight and to exercise when you don't want to or it's painful. I know how hard it is to have a toxic relationship with food. I could have been where he is easily. It's just so hard because he's such a nice guy. He deserves to live a happy healthy life, they both do. Two of the best people you'll ever meet. It breaks my heart. If they were assholes it would be so easy to just give my brutally honest opinion and not care who's feelings I hurt.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

He broke expensive furniture in your home. You say he felt so bad. So why do they come back without a warning and want to break the rest of your stuff? And why should you pay for it? They have no money with one income? Well, they have enough for surprise trips. And you have also no money - and two children. I also wonder why your best friend can't wash her husband? \n\nPlease speak up! If she can't understand, she isn't your friend. It is your home, keep it save. If they want to see you, they need to stay in a hotel and you come to them.", "I thought you had probably talked about all this but it is his life, he has to decide to make a change. I guess the best you can do is be as supportive of your friend as you can, she is going through a lot.", "I get that. Unfortunately, by the sounds of how close you are, it sounds like you're either headed for an incredibly uncomfortable conversation or an uncomfortable situation. I do wish you the best of luck, so sorry OP.", "This right here, you just have to say it straight. Because there's no way you can maintain this friendship if you are dishonest with her and don't create boundaries", "Let them come for two hours.", "If hubby is in on the surprise could he arrange a sitter for your little ones for a couple of hours and tell your friend that you don\u2019t get out often and it would be a real treat for you to meet them for coffee somewhere, no distractions, just a lovely time to catch up x good luck", "Nta...\n\nTo fix the toilet seat is an easy fix. On the back are two covers you can pop open with a flat head s few driver and then you can tighten the bolts and pop the cover back on.", "NTA try and meet up outside the house. I don't know where you are from nor the current weather you are having but meeting at a park could work. Kids can go playground, you can have a BBQ if the the park has those facility or pack a picnic.\n\nIf you're in a climate that's having snow, im not sure what free activities you could do. Meet at mall or something, food court would be a cheaper option than a restuarant.\n\nOr meet them at their hotel, which personally might be the best way to go.\n\nOtherwise, you may have to have a chat eith your friend about the costs and issues from the last visit.", "If this is a surprise visit, they should not expect to stay with you.  Surprising at SAHM with overnight guests isn't a kindness.  It's really rather rude.\n\nIf this is a surprise visit, maybe your partner can arrange to \"take you out\" and meet them at some public place instead of in your home.  It's not a pleasant surprise if you aren't expecting guests at home and aren't prepared to have them.  \n\nIt's cheaper to meet them at a coffee shop or restaurant, than it is to replace more furniture and fixtures in your home.", "I just didn't feel right saying obese, coming from a formerly obese person. I understand it's the proper term. Like I said when I met him and they first got together he was just overweight. I don't see them often and it's so hard to accept he's so big now. I almost have trouble picturing him now because that's just not the image I have of him in my head, despite the reality.", "To be fair I don't know if they noticed or not, I'm giving them the benefit of doubt. I don't want any money to fix anything, we replaced the couch and after the holidays we will replace the toilet seat. It's shitty, maybe I don't want to accept how shitty it really is.", "Haha I needed that!", "I'm also disabled, I have a connective tissue disorder. When I was pregnant with both of my kids I needed help in the shower. I gained like 60lbs with both too. At first it's embarrassing but when you can't reach areas or can't bend and have someone to help, you should ask for help. Over time it was nice to have someone who cares enough about me to make sure I was taking proper care of myself. I know she helps him at home, idk if she is used to his smell so she didn't notice but they were here for several days and he didn't wash himself once until I asked on around day 3 or 4. It was the summer and it was hot and I didn't want to say anything but I couldn't take it anymore. Our bathroom is very small too so he definitely couldn't fit in our shower. It took so long for the smell to go away.", "That's awesome advice thank you! Now that I know they aren't staying the night I can at least ask him not to sit on the couch but on one of my spare chairs I don't care about but if he has to use my toilet, I'm scared for the toilet. It still needs repaired from the last visit.", "Unfortunately no, it's gotten really cold here now so anything outdoors is out. Luckily when they came in the summer we spent most of the time outside. But now we will be confined indoors.", "Oh no, it's broken lol. It will have to be replaced. I wish!", "Not a bad excuse!! Lol", "I never told her that he broke them. I don't know if they noticed but I never said anything. I don't want them to pay for it, I just don't want it to keep happening. I wish a park or something outdoors was possible but it's cold here now so we are all stuck indoors or ice fishing lol", "I'm so sorry to hear about that! It's such a hard situation because you do what you can and try but it's an eating disorder. They have to want to change. It unfortunate that it affects everyone involved in their lives too. It really is a slow suicide. Eating disorders are so ugly. He's starting to get those infections in his skin folds too, that's where some of the smell is coming from. He's had to get it cut out before. I think that's part of the reason it's hard to say something because it is so serious and it's not just about the furniture. It's a whole conversation that has to happen.", "Also this poor guy is probably walking in anywhere he goes assessing every piece of furniture, wondering if he can sit there. Why not buy a super sturdy chair just for him? Maybe one of those folding camp chairs with high weight limits? They are comfy, you can give his wife a heads up and it would probably be appreciated!", "That part is what's broken, the bolt won't tighten on one side it's done", "I think you should bring it up with your friend and ask her what she thinks how you could address it. I could also imagine that your are not the only people where those problems have come up; he probably has other friends/family members with toilet and furniture issues too, when he visits. Maybe they have developed some strategies to handle it that you don\u2019t know about?", "You hit the nail on the head. Even with a regular visit he might need to use the bathroom and we never fixed the first issues so idk if our toilet will even be ok to use this time. How do you tell your best friend her husband isn't allowed over because he is too overweight? It seems so cruel. I know I can't accommodate him but it's just so heartbreaking.", "I dont see why they have to visit OP's house. I have  friends that have never been to my house. I have one friend that i have known for 21 years and i have never been to her house.", "One thing I've learned from watching my 600 lb life is that is it never to late  or impossible to lose the weight", "I get it. But this probably isn't the first time he's broken furniture. And even if they choose to be in denial it's not fair on you.", "Of course he knows he broke your couch. The crack would be loud and the couch would sink a bit. The toilet seat cracking would not be not noticeable. And the steel chair broke with him there. \n\nSo he 100% knows he broke stuff at your house. \n\nCall your friend. Explain you are broke and have already replaced these things. And can\u2019t afford to replace the toilet or couch again. \n\nYou will need to say something or replace the toilet seat and couch each time they visit. \n\nYou really only have those options.", "This!!! Great idea!!", "Maybe for this time, your fiance could help plan something out of the house. Say you've been cooped up and an outing would be great!\n\nFor the future of this situation, you definitely need to talk to your friend. I'd recommend writing down what you want to say so that even if you are nervous, you won't get as flustered. \n\nIt's going to be difficult, no lie. I would say something like \"I need to talk to you about something important, but I'm embarrassed and nervous\" \n\nYou could maybe discuss it in terms of finances? You have children to take care of and unfortunately there is a financial impact on your household after they visit and you have to repair things. \n\nAlso, not sure your kids' ages, but they will eventually be old enough to comment on it. Even if you tell them not to talk about it and they are the best behaved children, they are kids and something will be said and probably at the worst time. Then you have even more stress in this situation.", "I think you'll just have to explain what happened last time and say that unfortunately he won't be able to come over. I think that wording might be good... it's casual and not like... \"not allowed.\" \n\nShe might be really upset but inside she will know the logic and reality of it. She might get mad at you, but it would be out of embarrassment and frustration and maybe even anger at her husband. It must be pretty humiliating to be married to someone who breaks furniture and toilets. \n\nAll you can do is put it out there. You know that your house literally cannot accommodate him, and you have to let her know. It sucks, and it might be a while before your friendship can be okay again, but maybe she needs to know.", "The wax seal under the toilet probably need replacing. It's super easy with a little YouTube. I would do it sooner rather than later as a bad seal can cause significant water damage over time.", "Meet in public, and quietly explain why you can\u2019t ever host him in your home.", "I could run away. 30 seems like a good age to move to another country and change my name. \n\nYou're right though I have a tough talk coming up I think.", "Thank you so much! Your idea was so warm and loving. Anyone would be lucky to have you as a friend IRL", "Hahaha. Moving to another country sounds fabulous. But expensive. \n\nYou need to address with your friend. Sorry. Sometimes adulting is hard work and we have to have tough conversations. Or buy a new couch after each visit. Sadly!\n\nGood luck", "I\u2019m fat too. And I bet you would let me sit in your chairs!", "My great great grandmother once said to me \u201cwould you rather be happy or have nice furniture?\u201d so, yeah, I would let you sit in my chairs. We can get a pepperoni pizza and see who can eat the most!", "Your great grandmother is brilliant!!!!!! Let\u2019s try two pizzas and some mozzarella sticks.", "Margaritas with salt?", "Totally. Screams Christmas!!! Haha"]}
