I KNOW you're feeling that, because you're here.\n\nWhen you have a guy who thinks his reasons (just joking! helping!) are more important than your right to determine what happens to your body, when you have a guy who finds your discomfort funny even when you're in labor, when he sulks and storms off and generally emotionally punishes you for asserting a boundary, then number one, he can absolutely traumatize you with tickling alone.

He should have known better than to screw with you while you're in that kind of physical distress to begin with. The level of ignorance, cruelty, or both that could inspire him to try it must be really high.\n\n2. Once he passed red flag 1, he didn't stop when you asked him to stop tickling you. He willingly violated your consent immediately after having a boundary set. Not ever good.\n\n3. When you defended your boundary, he threw a tantrum and stormed out as if you were being the AH. This is what is called DARVO, and is a good abuse tactic to read up on. You should not end up apologizing to him every time he does something awful and you call him out on it.\n\n4. You're pregnant, and unfortunately many abusive men wait to show their true colors until after they think you can no longer escape, like soon after marriage or during pregnancy.

There could be an AITA post where a man accidentally knocks over a plastic cup and is considered an abusive monster. Please not just ypu but all of AITA, not everything a man does is abusive or a sign of adultery. How would you judge the situation if a woman was tickling her husband for fun while he is injured or sick? Your AITA judgement may be the same, but you sure as hell wouldn't say the woman is abusive, would you? Remember that AITA stories are to judge situations, and unless something really extreme happens, then ABUSE accusations are completely unfair and ridiculous.\n\nETA: Your other AITA comments don't seem too bad, just please, do not help dragging AITA into a parody of itself", "Right?  And then LEAVE HER while she's in freaking LABOR??  What an asshat", "God, that sounds horrific.", "The whole family? Thats too twisted for color TV. Sickos, the lot of them.", "Makes me wonder if the other kids were also being traumatized by this but didn't say anything because it was their normal", "I would probably kick someone in the face with no remorse if they tickled me while in labour. I was also held down and tickled as a kid and mixed with all my other traumas it seems to trigger a ptsd reaction. Even reading this post and comment section has me all tense and angry. I\u2019ve also never intentionally tickled another person, including my son.", "Well that sounds awful! Weird that your own mother wild call you mean for taking actions to protect yourself! Totally awesome message to send to your daughter!\n\nI'm sorry you went through that.\n\nTickling children is normal in many families, but beating children with sticks, whipping them, caning them, and so on also used to be normal and that doesn't make them okay either.", "In our house, we say 'No means no'.  I didn't think a lot about it when I started it, I just knew there was a line with these things where play can become too much..  so we respect the stop sign. \n\nLater, when looking at children with healthy body autonomy and who are able to set clear boundaries, I'm glad I trusted that instinct and I'm also glad you found some to respect yours.

Not in any way at all. Your baby daddy needs to show up, grow up and step up. Therapy for what is and isn\u2019t appropriate and just HOW much he messed up is important.

OPs immature husband made it all about himself and bloody walked out on her when she was beginning labour. What a lovely gesture from the father to be.

I tend to hit out of instinct too when I'm tickled. That is NOT an abusive reaction. That is something that is very hard to control, especially considering the trauma they have around being tickled.
