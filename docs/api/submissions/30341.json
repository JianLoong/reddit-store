You told him to stop and he didn't.\n\nThis is actually a pretty significant problem. Tickling is literally the first thing around which you can start teaching small children about bodily autonomy and consent, and you appear to have a co-parent who doesn't understand the concept of consent to begin with.", "I've never been so physically repulsed by a Reddit post as I am this one. NTA.", "You didn't react badly but your fiance sure as hell did. \n\nDamn. If I was having contractions and my SO told me was \"helping me\" go into labor I'd have straight up told him I didn't NEED his help in that department thank you very much. \n\nI'd actually reconsider marrying someone who didn't listen to me. And actually have broken up with someone who tickled my feet. Seriously! Due to childhood trauma I DO NOT like my feet touched. Period! My ex BF thought it hilarious to stick a finger between my toes while I was in the shower and at the time I was bent over to get the shampoo. Needless to say I whacked my head on one of the shower handles and damn near had a panic attack. I finished my shower in tears and later asked what possessed him to do that KNOWING I dont like my feet touched AND the reason why. He saw my foot under the shower curtain and got a wild hair up his ass. The AH never even apologized.", "NTA - tickling can be fun but if it continues after you've asked for it to stop, it's asshole behavior. Many have likened it to other forms of bullying and abuse. Going by his reaction to your objection, I'm going to assume he's the bullying sort who thinks everyone else is too sensitive as long as he's having fun. That's a red flag.", "NTA. OP, you told this man to stop doing something to your body that you didn't like, and he ignored you  and forced you to continue to experience it. That is ABUSE. He violated your bodily consent. And then he turned it around and tried to make out like YOU were the one who did something wrong? This makes me sick to read; it's such classic narcissistic abuse. I'm so sorry. You did nothing wrong and this guy is a prick.", "This guy would have been rendered unable to have kids, right there and then, if I were OP. Talk about red flags. I hope she dumps his loser a$$.", "Oh my god I\u2019d have broken his nose. NTA. What the actual fuck??", "How easily the wounded feelings of an aggressor make women second guess themselves and apologize for saying *No*\n\nNTA.

Sorry your fianc\u00e9\u2019s a moron OP, hopefully he\u2019ll grow up before your guys baby does.", "NTA, unless what you said/how you said it dramatically exceeds the parameters of how you have phrased it here. Even if you'd really blown up at him, you'd end up getting quick forgiveness in the context of what you were going through.\n\nThere's a lot going on here. He sounds rather immature. Does he tickle you often? Does it come out more when you are stressed/angry and he's trying to get you to laugh? How do you usually respond, if so? \n\nI've always leaned on humor in stressful situations. I'm good at it after this many years. Even so, the joke doesn't always land. But, I've had to work VERY hard to recognize and overcome my triggers for when the impulse to joke is a response to my own anxiety. \n\nEven if this behavior is relatively normal within your relationship, not stopping when someone says \"Stop!\" is a HUGE problem. You need to talk to him about that, if you plan on staying with him long-term. You need to establish clear boundaries, and HOLD them firmly. This should be a sacrosanct rule in a healthy relationship. If he can't see that once you've both had a minute to calm down, then you've got a really big, relationship-ending problem.", "Did he want an excuse to start a fight and storm out?  Were you taking all of his attention by, y\u2019know, having a kid? /s.", "NTA\n\nWarn your husband about tickling feet. My dad never respected that I despised being tickled until he tickled my foot and on reflex I kicked out and broke his jaw.", "Oh yeah, tickling during contractions, what a novel idea to do to someone in pain. Gods, I hurt for you. And this fool couldn't handle a simple no? You are actively headed into having a baby, and he wants to be butthurt and make it all about him? Dear gods, you have two babies on your hands...\n\nNTA", "I would have decked him. Or hit him in the crotch. Or both. \n\nThe advent of fathers in the delivery room is fairly new.

She has a right to have her bodily autonomy and consent respected, and forcing painful physical contact that she is saying no to is really, legitimately abusive. Saying \"whatever\" when she's in pain and begging him to stop is ALSO abuse, while we're at it. So is saying \"I was just joking\" when he's hurt her and trying to frame it as something she's done wrong. What's insane is thinking that if it's not a beating then it's not abuse. Soft-pedalling it as \"just childish\" is what keeps a lot of people in abusive situations.   \n\n\nAnd I'm not your cupcake.", "when someone cares about you, they don't get their jollies out of hurting you and violating your consent, and then dismiss your suffering as an overreaction and walk away telling you that you were the one who behaved badly. When you tell someone to stop touching you, they need to stop. That is literally a kindergarten level rule.", "She wasnt begging him to stop, she asked. All he did was tickle his partner one to many times and reacted poorly afterwards, thats literally it. If you really feel that way its best you stay single lol.", "You\u2019re missing the point here. The abusive part isn\u2019t so much that he tickled her and then did it again despite her asking him not to (that\u2019s just shitty behaviour BECAUSE SHE WAS IN LABOUR. This didn\u2019t happen on the couch on a normal Sunday night). The abusive part is that he threw a freaking TANTRUM, tried to make OP feel bad while she was literally in the act of birthing his child and then STORMED OUT when his partner and mother of his very soon to be born child needed him most. \n\nThis was a time for him to be supportive, mature and attentive. Not to act like a 12 year old d*ckhead. \n\nHe needs to grow up. \n\nOP is NTA.", ">The abusive part is that he threw a freaking TANTRUM, tried to make OP feel bad while she was literally in the act of birthing his child and then STORMED OUT when his partner and mother of his very soon to be born child needed him most. \n\n100% agree. But tickling your partner 1 more time after he or she asked you to stop is not, its just really annoying. Hell, if my gf tickled me once more after I asked her to stop the last word that would come to my mind is \"abuse\". I just find it disrespectful to people that have actually been abused is all.", "So, people like OP?\n\nYou really need to stop being part of the problem by minimising abuse.", "Well, I just think being overly sensitive is a new trend im not keen of participating in.", "Well, I just think being undersensitive to abuse is an old trend I'm not keen to participate in.", "Which is fine aswell"]}
