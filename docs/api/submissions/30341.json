It is SO EASY to listen when someone uses their words regarding what they do and don't want for their body. It is SO SO SO easy. The bar is SO LOW.

I KNOW you're feeling that, because you're here.\n\nWhen you have a guy who thinks his reasons (just joking! helping!) are more important than your right to determine what happens to your body, when you have a guy who finds your discomfort funny even when you're in labor, when he sulks and storms off and generally emotionally punishes you for asserting a boundary, then number one, he can absolutely traumatize you with tickling alone.

This is very very very easy to understand; literal kindergartners understand it. He knows what he was doing was hurting you. He just doesn't care. And no amount of talking or negotiating or yelling or crying or pleading or anything you can do will make him care. He might PRETEND to care. For a while. To get you to stay. But he won't change. Not for you.

No. To all of that.", "NTA\n\nI will add to the chorus that this scene is a collection of red flags for abuse.\n\n1. He tickled you while you were actively having contractions. He should have known better than to screw with you while you're in that kind of physical distress to begin with. The level of ignorance, cruelty, or both that could inspire him to try it must be really high.\n\n2. Once he passed red flag 1, he didn't stop when you asked him to stop tickling you. He willingly violated your consent immediately after having a boundary set. Not ever good.\n\n3. When you defended your boundary, he threw a tantrum and stormed out as if you were being the AH. This is what is called DARVO, and is a good abuse tactic to read up on. You should not end up apologizing to him every time he does something awful and you call him out on it.\n\n4. You're pregnant, and unfortunately many abusive men wait to show their true colors until after they think you can no longer escape, like soon after marriage or during pregnancy.

It's damn awful at the best of times.\n\nYou did not over react.  He did.

So when he decided to lay on my backside and keep tickling, it wasn't my fault when my foot involuntarily kicked up & back, smacking him square in the walnuts. I honestly didn't have any control over the situation but he sure did become the victim afterwards.

We lost her very suddenly last year.", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss.  Grief is painful and complicated.  \n\nSometimes it\u2019s complicated even more by memories like this, as you start to unpack things that happened and behaviors that were taken for granted over your entire lifetime with a person, and realize some of them \u2026 weren\u2019t so great.  \n\nI\u2019ve been going through this kind of assessment since my own mom died five years ago.  A lot of stuff has bubbled to the surface that I didn\u2019t realize had affected me badly.

Shaming you for being \u201cmean\u201d to the dog when she was using the dog to torment you was not good parenting, nor good pet-keeping, and it\u2019s not disloyal or being unappreciative of her better qualities to come to these realizations even after she\u2019s gone and you can\u2019t resolve it with her.  \n\nI wish you and your family members peace of mind as you work through the grief  process.", "Same with me! I am absolutely morbidly afraid of being tickled due to similar abuse issues, and I recently deck to somebody who tickled me after I had JUST told them how much I hated it", "Thank you very much.  I definitely have some things to process.  I love my mom a lot, but I definitely knew she wasn't perfect.  She definitely also did the things she did with good intentions... but we had some issues.  Mainly differences in how she treated me and my siblings... but she also kind of felt that because she was concerned or anxious for my well-being, that gave her a right to exercise an unreasonable amount of control over my life.", "Yikes I hope his walnuts never recovered", "I'm like this too. My brother used to pin me to the ground and tickle me until I would scream, cry and often pee myself and then he'd laugh at the fact that I peed. He's 12 years older than me so while I was a child/teenager, he was already into his 20s and way bigger than me, so I could never fight him off. As soon as anyone, even friends and other family members, tries to even touch my waist, I instantly go into fight or flight mode.\n\nI told a friend once that I despised being tickled, so he naturally tried to tickle me. I started crying immediately, shouted at him that this wasn't a fucking joke and stormed out of his house. He is not my friend anymore.\n\nI also read somewhere that laughing while being tickled can be a defense mechanism because our mind/body perceives us as being in danger and laughing is a show of submissiveness to the aggressor to lighten up the situation and prevent ourselves from being hurt."]}
