Customers have been calling the store to report they haven\u2019t be receiving the code for the extra value, so we were collecting their info for a manager to reach out to at a later time. Well, a customer called and left a voicemail from 1 number, so naturally I called back that number. After dialing I was greeting with a generic work place phone intro, so I hung up after realizing that it was a work number. The customer calls back, I answer, and I begin to explain while since it\u2019s may 1 I don\u2019t have much info and that if they would give me their info I could pass it to management who was working to fix the issue. The customer began berating me, as my co worker stood next to me watching me attempt to speak and get cut off several times. (he later informed me he heard almost everything the customer said because they were screaming at me through the phone) Finally I explained that I need their info to find the account and cannot do anything in this moment but would contact management and reach out with a solution. This is where the customer decided to scream how we were scammers and call me a slur. I immediately stated I was uncomfortable continuing this call and would have a manager reach out and to have a great day and hung up. Here\u2019s where I might of been the AH. Since I noticed they called from a work line, I searched the number and saw it was for a company and decided to call back and inform that company their employee is using their work number to berate and disrespect people, as they people didn\u2019t want stuff like that linked to their number. The woman who answered the phone said she would let HR know and thanked me for informing them. A bit later, that customer called back demanding a manager because they wanted to file a police report on me for \u201charassment\u201d for calling their job, which I found funny as they called us back 7 times from the work number after I hung up after being disrespected. My other co workers said I went to far and my management team seems to agree but I can\u2019t see how what I did was bad. You shouldn\u2019t use company numbers to do bad things if you don\u2019t want it linked to you right? Anyways I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not but my co workers are saying since the customers got pulled into hr at their job I might of got someone fired, and that\u2019s why im the AH.\n\n\nUpdate:\nJust wanted to edit and say I\u2019m actually so surprised this kinda blew up, is my first post ever! I appreciate all the positive support and advice! I went in to work today and the manager there told me that basically it\u2019s nothing to worry about and as far as they see it that person got karma! \nFor people saying as a customer service worker I should just deal with it, ask yourself why abusive and disrespectful language has become so normal to use against customer service workers??? Because of situations like this where they receive no repercussions. It is not okay at all. Again I will reiterate I didn\u2019t call on company time or company phone when I reported it. Bc some people seem a bit confused about that. And the reason they screamed and cursed me out and completely disrespected me could of simply been solved by them providing me the number to their account like I opened the call with. I tried for almost 8 minutes to get through and calm them down before I was called slurs and decided to hang up.

They took information they got from work and used it to bother them off company time. The guy was 100% on the wrong but OP 100% handled it wrong but not letting management know to take care of it then by using the information they got from work and stole it. Most companies have policies against this kind of BS. OP just proved they can't be trusted\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "As an employer, I would be really worried that my employees are using the work phone to verbally abuse someone in customer services. Not only because it's immoral, but because it can back fire quickly and hard if instead of calling back OP had decided to go on Twitter to make a complaint.", "Anyone who talks to someone that way deserves to pay the consequences, especially when they're using company assets to do so. People like you who excuse that shit are why there's so many entitled assholes in this world.", "^ wants to say slurs on the phone", "Not about bigotry.", "It actually does though. If they said you gypped me that is not the same as calling someone a F***** or the N word because language has culture and nuance to it. To call the employer of someone who said something obnoxious and ignorant is way way different than that of someone who was hateful or threatening.\n\nLet's not pretend like language doesn't have meaning while trying to  be the most woke person in the rook at the same time lol.", "NTA, ESPECIALLY because he literally called you on his work phone. Play stupid games.", "NTA karma is a bitch", "NTA they fafo and hopefully they learned a lesson. Good on you!", "Oh nooooo, the consequences of being a fucking asshole boooo hoooooo. That person is probably nasty inside and out, and has probably gotten away with this behavior since they're so comfortable with it. I would give absolutely NO fucks about whether or not they lost their job. \n\n1. Don't be a raging racist.\n2. Don't use work numbers/emails for personal use, if anything, to keep your personal correspondence private and unmonitored. \n3. Don't be a raging racist. This part is super important.", "NTA. I've absolutely gotten someone fired before for forwarding their disgusting Facebook comments to the company.\n\nPeople don't deserve to be terrible in secret just because they aren't at work, or trying to hind behind internet anonymity.", "Hurt ho.", "YTA, even though ESH. Because someone else being an A is not an excuse to be one also.\n\nAt most, you should\u2019ve told your manager about it and let them handle it if they chose to. By being so petty, YOU made YOUR company look bad.  And using the customer\u2019s phone number for anything unrelated to the transaction regarding the gift card (and this is unrelated) is a BIG no-no.", "Lmao. So he gets to use his work number for personal use, and gets to use his work number to verbally abuse someone else, and their the asshole for letting his company know he's a shit employee? The double standards you have are fucking wild. Please tell me more.", "Or, seeing as he was too busy being an abusive asshole to give away any of the info that was requested- like his name- they just provided the number he used to call. I'm pretty sure most companies keep a record of their employees work numbers lmao. And this wasn't about him pissing OP off. He used his work number for personal business and negatively represented his company by verbally harassing another person with his work phone. He absolutely deserves all the shit that comes his way. He has a personal phone for a reason. If he had followed the rules, and not used his work phone for things unrelated to work he wouldn't be in this mess.", "He also represents his company. He used a work line for not only personal use, but to use abusive language and harass another person. Honestly OP could've taken action against the entire company for that, reporting him to HR is literally an upgrade lmao. If they fire OP, I'm sure they could get in trouble as well. That'd be like telling your employees you have to take abuse from customers. Which isn't okay at all.", "They shouldn\u2019t have used a racial slur and should not have used a company phone. Karma is a bitch. Company doesn\u2019t want an employee who uses racial slurs that on him", "Lmao, he used his work number, presumably during work hours, for personal business and harassed and verbally abused OP with his work number. I think you can imagine the amount of legal shit his company could've gotten in because of his actions. And I'm going to go out on a limb and say this wasn't his first time using his work number inappropriately. OP saved them a lot of money by only reporting him. OP could've filed a lawsuit against the company, but instead only made his actions known to the higher ups. \n\nOP used their own phone during their personal time to inform his company of the actions he made while representing their brand. OP will never be the asshole in this situation, period.", "Lmao you definitely don't have any understanding of the situation or just how bad it could've been for him and his company because of his abusive actions.", "They said they did it on their off time with their personal phone. Not like he did, where he used his work number, during working hours, for personal business and to verbally abuse and harass OP. The legal trouble his company could get into alone is enough for him to be thanking OP for ONLY reporting him.", "I would hope it obvious that ANYONE would be offended by an actual SLUR.  And said slur was thrown *over company phones* \u2014 it\u2019s not like OP was called a slur and hired a PI to find out where the AH works, and then Google the number.", "Have you considered not screaming slurs at people?", "Then don't call from a company phone? It's not hard to shop somewhere AND not let them know where you work....", "Like how he used his work phone for personal business and to verbally abuse and harass OP? Do you know how much legal trouble his company could get in because of his actions? OP did them a favor by ONLY reporting him.", "There aren't 2 separate issues tho. He used his work number not only for personal business, but to harass and verbally abuse another person. That reflects bad on his company in so many different ways. OP is absolutely in the right when they notify his company. If he didn't want the face the consequences of his actions, he should've been a big boy. Instead he acted like an spoiled toddler. How fucking ignorant and complacent to his actions do you have to be in order to say these are two separate issues?", "Wow, found another asshole.", "They're screaming slurs at a stranger over the phone? They deserve to be pulled into HR. NTA", "NTA\n\nHang up the second they get disrespectful next time.  You don't get paid to be abused.", "What was the slur? Are people disagreeing with you perhaps because you are making it bigger than it was?", "Did it make you feel good to affect someones life because they hurt your feelings?", "YTA.", "Wild, I would have hung up once that customer began yelling at me.. NTA", "I did however he clearly knew it was me as the interaction was only a few hours before I called", "Do you also call other people slurs?", "Wasnt on the job listing that it\u2019s required to deal w abuse. Do u know how fucked up that sounds? Oh ur gonna get abused just deal w it \ud83d\ude44 hell nah", "Maybe they should of thought of that before harassing someone and calling them slurs\u2026 crazy thought huh", "It wasn\u2019t their number it was their work companies number that wasn\u2019t attached to their account because they refused to provide the correct one", "Yk what could really cause an issue? Word gets out both companies allow raging racists to get away with harassment. Especially when using a company/work contact.op was absolutely justified to report to the company that one of their employees was harassing them.", "Then maybe you shouldn't give them something to complain about. If being held accountable makes you upset, think hard about why that is.", "Have you ever worked a customer service job??? When you work somewhere you represent that company/business especially when using work related contact info which are completely public. Op didn\u2019t just decide that what that customer said was offensive it was point blank and the company agrees. If you\u2019re behavior is so bad you worry employee\u2019s are going to call your job that is on you.people like you are the reason harassment and racism in the workplace is rarely taken seriously or dealt with.", "OP didn't have to look up anything. The idiot racist called from their work number. Also, why should OP be A Good Employee and take that crap, but the person using the slur is okay NOT being A Good Employee? This cuts both ways.\n\nRacism is never cool. Nor is defending a racist. Full stop."]}
