Customers have been calling the store to report they haven\u2019t be receiving the code for the extra value, so we were collecting their info for a manager to reach out to at a later time. Well, a customer called and left a voicemail from 1 number, so naturally I called back that number. After dialing I was greeting with a generic work place phone intro, so I hung up after realizing that it was a work number. The customer calls back, I answer, and I begin to explain while since it\u2019s may 1 I don\u2019t have much info and that if they would give me their info I could pass it to management who was working to fix the issue. The customer began berating me, as my co worker stood next to me watching me attempt to speak and get cut off several times. (he later informed me he heard almost everything the customer said because they were screaming at me through the phone) Finally I explained that I need their info to find the account and cannot do anything in this moment but would contact management and reach out with a solution. This is where the customer decided to scream how we were scammers and call me a slur. I immediately stated I was uncomfortable continuing this call and would have a manager reach out and to have a great day and hung up. Here\u2019s where I might of been the AH. Since I noticed they called from a work line, I searched the number and saw it was for a company and decided to call back and inform that company their employee is using their work number to berate and disrespect people, as they people didn\u2019t want stuff like that linked to their number. The woman who answered the phone said she would let HR know and thanked me for informing them. A bit later, that customer called back demanding a manager because they wanted to file a police report on me for \u201charassment\u201d for calling their job, which I found funny as they called us back 7 times from the work number after I hung up after being disrespected. My other co workers said I went to far and my management team seems to agree but I can\u2019t see how what I did was bad. You shouldn\u2019t use company numbers to do bad things if you don\u2019t want it linked to you right?

It\u2019s already bad enough being called a slur, but he also called several times after you finished the call. \n\nHOWEVER, I can under why your company isn\u2019t happy about this and I would have run it first by a superior, if I got along with them well enough that thought they would have my back.\n\nDon\u2019t do it again, but get some written statement from your coworker regarding the slur (for example, write an email to your management with something like \u201ci apologize for my rash action, but as X will confirm, this costumer used \u201cthis slur\u201d and I would appreciate it if the company supported a fight against this type of comments when dealing with costumers/offered some support when dealing with such costumers\u201d.)", "NTA.  Your reasoning is correct. In fact, the screamer represents their company since they are using company resources.  You are not obligated to put yourself into or to stay in an abusive situation for work.  Anyone at that other company is obligated to report what they heard to HR as it was clearly abuse. You as well have that right since you were the target. Your manager needs retraining on these concepts.", "NTA...everyone has bad days but when I have had one where I was perhaps a little angry toward someone, I immediately apologised and NEVER used any slurs.

I hesitate to judge whether you are an ah or not because you were verbally abused by this customer but since management isn\u2019t pleased with what you did, you probably overstepped and should have contacted his workplace in a way that didn\u2019t implicate your store.", "YTA. That was petty, vengeful  and mean spirited. You may have cost that person their job. Just ending the call would\u2019ve been sufficient. I worked in a call center for ten years and was called any and everything you could imagine. I was also a supervisor and if I or any of my associates had called another company on company time to do this, I would\u2019ve been disciplined. Your company should have procedures to follow if you get a caller who is using inappropriate language. It\u2019s not your place to take matters into your own hands and alienate one of the company\u2019s customers. There could be repercussions. You should\u2019ve reported it to management and let it go. Don\u2019t be surprised if this comes up on your performance review. You are representing the company as their agent, not yourself.
