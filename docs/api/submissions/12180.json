(The relationship between parent and child can be tenuous when the child is an adult.)\n\nI recommend you be the bigger person by apologizing for an extreme reaction, but tell him that when you go to the effort of making a meal for him and he criticizes it, it hurts your feelings makes you not want to cook for him anymore.", "ESH.\n\n-\tDad sucks for hassling you while you acquire a new skill.\n-\tYou suck for wasting food.\n-\tYou suck for speaking for your sister.\n\nPoints where the two of you don\u2019t suck:\n\n-\tI\u2019m assuming he\u2019s buying the food.\n-\tYou\u2019re trying to help.\n\nSincerely apologize for making him experience your skill acquisition and advise him he will not have to endure your bland food in the future.

My guess is you were trying to do something nice yet he was not being appreciative.\n\nHOWEVER, there are ways to communicate better than to throw his food away. (1) it\u2019s a waste.

He failed to teach you how to cook basic meals, so now you must do it on your own. It\u2019s awesome that you\u2019re making progress, keep going! \n\nOn the other hand, you should\u2019ve communicated with your dad about how his comments made you feel.

I get you don't know how to cook, but it's a simple skill every adult should have. It's simple: follow the recipe.

I would imagine if you can't pay rent than you probably are not contributing much to food expenses. Even if you are no rent is a huge boon. Instead you are a burden one they probably took on happily but be aware that it is not just that you are there rent free.\n\nDoes it reflect badly on your father that you don't know how to cook yes. Should you say as much yes. Is you volunteering to cook in some gesture of appreciation for free rent a decent exchange no.\n\nThey should not be mocking food if you are uncomfortable. At the same time there are age, personality and cultural differences in what is appropriate humour. You know your father better than Reddit but is this typical humour for him? If it is are you stressed about the joke or the difficulty of life such as job searching? \n\nI would say just give it back to him in humour. Make it clear if it is okay for him than it is okay for you. \n\nI might also wonder about the food being the issue. I don't know his age but I would  expect that with his possible age bracket food wastage is a problem. He would not appreciate putting food in a garbage bin if it is edible albeit some what lacking flavour. The same reason I expect that he eats everything even if he is not entirely happy with the food. This is a guess. \n\nFinally you made a choice. You could move home or make your own way and burn savings. You chose home  and there will be some discomfort with you being an adult coming back. It is the trade off you make coming back like that.", "Everyone equates \u201cdad jokes\u201d as being lame, but really they are mocking, repetitive, and insulting.

You should have just mentioned it to him like an adult. \n\nPerhaps write an apology letter saying you understand you had an over reaction and how hurtful and disrespectful his \"jokes\" (especially considering the basics of seasoning is something a father should have made time to do before you reached adulthood so it's he who dropped the ball).", "ESH\n\nHonestly, your reaction was justified in taking away the food you made him.

I LOVE COOKING, really really really LOVE cooking but i was SHIT at it no matter what i try. and when i say i tried, i TRIED. I will glow myself to my mother's side during her cooking and no matter what i do, i either burn the food or ruin her pots and pans. I cannot stress how bad i was i almost burned the house down twice. TWICE. This continued into adulthood and when i worked i will spend a lot of it on kitchenware (Still do). try new receipts, good quality ingredients and so on and still nothing worked (for some reason i was brilliant at coffee and tea and my dad and his friends will ask for my coffee and tea over my mom's but she is a fantastic cook).\n\nAnyway, during one of my annual leaves, i had to have a surgery and the doctor's jokingly said \"she is not to eat anything but grapes\" and my family took that literally. for 5 days i was eating nothing but grapes while the family was having the time of their life and i hated every moment of it. I snapped and went to the kitchen starving and angry and guess what i made a fantastic meal. Till this day i cannot believe it. its like something suddenly switched on and i can actually understand cooking and how ingredients taste together and how they affect the process. since then (that was back in 2014 i guess) i am a very good cook and can have a full 3 course meal for the whole family. \n\nwhat im getting at is , I TRIED my damnest and it paid off. \n\nOP, i don't see any mention whether your parents helped you to learn to cook and whether you tried or not or did you suddenly find yourself in need of learning? this is important because to me an adult should be able to cook for themselves or at least try and i tried desperately.\n\ni agree ESH.", "The dad probably considers it the fault of her mother.
