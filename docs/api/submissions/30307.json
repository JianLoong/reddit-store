Too many opinions to consider when yours  is the not one that matters.  Good luck with the hen party!", "NTA\n\nThis is your experience not everyone else's. You didn't pick the dress and even if you had it is your wedding.

Wedding dress shopping can be really overwhelming with so many different options, styles and opinions.

You wanted to try a few random dresses before and as an adult you can do just that. I mean what if during the time you were with all of them, you didnt find \"the one\"? Then you would have to wait all their schedules to match so you could go hunting the dress again?\n\nSo yeah, you are definitely not the ahole, and while I do understand why they are upset, I dont think they have the right to complain or mistreat you because of it, specially since in the end you didnt find the dress you want yet.\n\nYou have the right to do things the way it makes it confortable for you. Also if you do go later with all of them, dont forget that this is YOUR dress and YOUR wedding.

People will be hurt because of course they want to be there but it\u2019s not like they aren\u2019t still going to be there for the big event and it\u2019s not like you found the one without them. Even if you did it\u2019s your big day, no one else\u2019s. I felt uncomfortable like you did so I went once with my best friend to David\u2019s bridal. Found a lot I hated and a few I liked but not enough for them to be the one. Then I went again with just my sister to a little boutique where almost every single one could\u2019ve been the one. I decided to bring the whole party back to that boutique and together we found the one. I didn\u2019t tell anyone I went with others or tried on dresses before so you could\u2019ve maybe kept that part just between yourself and your mom but at the end of the day, it\u2019s your wedding dress.

And it\u2019s great to foster a good relationship between everyone. \n\nUltimately she didn\u2019t choose a dress that day. Her and her mom found one on a different day with just the two of them. And she sent me pictures that day so I could see it.", "Refer back to my original comment.", "Yeah, but it doesn't really make a lot of sense. Unless she's trying on the exact same dresses she did with just her mom-which obviously she's not bc that would be stupid and pointless-then she *will* be showing initial reactions to the dresses. You realize that not every dress in a certain style is exactly the same, right? Take [this mermaid dress](https://www.kleinfeldbridal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pnina-tornai-sleeveless-satin-square-neck-mermaid-wedding-dress-with-pearl-belt-and-overskirt-48000009.jpg) and compare it to [this one](https://www.magment.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/White-Mermaid-Wedding-Dresses.jpg). Very different designs, right? OP would have a different reaction to both of them.", "NTA. Not even a little bit. Dress shopping can be totally overwhelming. Having others judge how things look on you before you even know yourself is scary. You meant no I\u2019ll will. You were ensuring that you and your group would have a fun time together. I\u2019d let everyone know you understand their hurt feelings come from how much they love you and want to share in your journey, but you need them to love you enough to support you and what is good for you. If they can\u2019t then they get removed from planning. CONGRATULATIONS!", "NTA. When I bought my wedding dress it was just me and my Mom. It was super special and I was glad I didn\u2019t have other people there to ruin it.", "Mother of the groom doesn't go bridal dress shopping!!!!! This privilege belongs to mother of bride! Yes, it can include bride's sister, MOH,  bridesmaids. MOG goes tux shopping with the groom. The groom has no right to dictate who goes dress shopping.  He needs to back off!", "NTA. Sometimes girls just want their mama\u2019s and nobody else. Tell your family and friends to build a bridge and get over it.", "NTA", "NTA. You went to get a sense of what style you want so you weren\u2019t wasting the group appointment doing that and instead could focus on finding the perfect dress during the group appointment. Most people try to do that. Often it is browsing the store\u2019s website, but it can be hard if you have no clue what you want. The appointment your mom went to was simply figuring out the style you want.", "and once again brides questioning if they are allowed to do bride stuff in case other people whine.\n\nOne - traditionally it is a mother daughter thing, NO hordes of women. Two - you're an adult who is getting married, why do you require anyone to agree with anything you choose to do? Three - everything you said about a peaceful look around & it was for you unlike the dress up loud argumentative get together - exactly the reasons it is trad. a mother/daughter activity.\n\nI would tell your fiance especially that you don't require anyone's permission & he should be pleased that you enjoyed it with your mum. NOT worried about the easily offended MIL.", "NTA. Get this through your head. Right now. This wedding is about you and what you want. YOU and your fianc\u00e9. But your dress is 100% YOU.  I say this because people will try so hard to make it about them.  It isn\u2019t at all. Honestly. I tried my dress on with 1 friend.  It\u2019s how I was comfy. Lots of people were upset but oh well. I wanted to be comfortable. I wanted to pick my dress out without all the opinions of others.  Just like I picked out my flowers.  And food. The food my husband came to lol. This is for you.  Not them.", "NTA. At all. Anyone who begrudges you for doing something with just you and your mom is,", "NTA. At all. Anyone who begrudges you for doing something with just you and your mom is,", "NTA. You aren't obligated to include anyone you don't want involved in the process. It's time to remind people that it's your wedding and you are the one who decides on the dress, the guest list, the ceremony, everything. They are guests, and that can be changed if they want to give you a hard time.", "NTA. If you're still going on Sunday they'll get their chance.", "NTA.  My DIL went dress shopping with just her mom.  Would I have loved to have been a part of that?  Absolutely.  But she wanted it to just be her and her mom\u2026and I respected that.  Too many voices can just complicate the whole process.  Don\u2019t feel bad because you and your mom did wedding stuff without any other voices there to cloud the process.", "NTA. My first shopping trip was all alone after work, likewise to get an idea of what to ask for at the Family Shopping Extravaganza. Your relatives still get to see you try on a bunch of dresses and hopefully see you pick THE dress, they can chill.", "I know I'm going to sound like a cranky old lady, but they run in my family, so here goes.... WHEN did weddings get so precious? I mean.... in my day (yep, I have all the phrases down), we just looked through some magazines, maybe checked out a few stores on our own during lunch break, maybe went out one weekend with a girlfriend or two. No one gave a flying f\\*ck if it wasn't all documented and witnessed by every bridesmaid or mother in law. Geez. so stressful. Do whatever the hell you want. It's your wedding. For every decision to be made, ask yourself which one brings more joy, and drop the ones that mostly bring stress. Congratulations and enjoy.", "I don't think having a big group is a good idea anyway.  You haven't even figured out your own preferences yet.  It would be so much harder to do that with five other people busy telling your THEIR preferences and all trying to talk over each other.\n\nNow if you do go out with the group, you probably have a better idea of what you'd like, and will have more strength to stand your ground on your own preferences, instead of everyone else's.", "YTA. So you made plans to share a special  moment with loved ones (your choice), instead you decided to go alone with your mother excluding the others (your choice), and then expect no one to be upset? For some, going wedding dress shopping is a rite of passage.  They were excited to experience  it with you while you just said no thanks in the most rude way possible. Lol. Next time just be upfront saying you just want your mother. Honesty is best but that is not what you did.", "Oh god no. NTA I get that it\u2019s fun to have everyone there, but it makes it hard to focus and make a decision, especially when you have no idea what you want. Your approach was perfect. You went with your mom and shared that moment with her, and you narrowed down your options. If these people support you, they should want to help make the process easier.", "\u201cInitial reactions\u201d still happen when trying on different dresses at different stores. Ask me how I know!\n\nThis is ridiculous lol, the bride doesn\u2019t become public property just because she\u2019s getting married. Not every pre-wedding activity must be imbued with Special Meaning for which every member of her inner circle must be present. She\u2019s *shopping*, not winning a Nobel Prize.", "Is this even a thing now ? Inviting the MIL to the Wedding dress shopping ?", "I was just going to ask the same question! I got married 10 years ago and didn't even consider asking my future MIL to go dress shopping with me and my Mom. Quite honestly, my Mom would have been hurt. I also had a very small bridal party so only my Mom and MOH went shopping with me.\n\nOP, you are NTA.", "My husband's step mom went with me. My mom lived too far to come just for that and his mother would have driven me bat shit crazy. I invited the one woman who I knew would make the experience easy and I was in and out in a few hours. I didn't let anyone dictate my special day, I planned and executed my own wedding in less than 3 months and anyone who tried to mess with it was kindly told to f* off. My husband fully supported every move I made and even helped me when needed because at the end of the day it was about him and I and all the people we chose to share it with."]}
