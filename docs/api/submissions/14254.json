Now, other co-workers have been doing this too so there\u2019s usually a coffee run once or twice a week.\n\nMost of my co-workers just get plain lattes or refreshers but not my desk-mate. My desk-mate asks for an ice coffee with all types of extras on it (which makes it more expensive) as well as a few pastries.  You do you, but she only orders this and my other co-workers have gotten annoyed with it too.  \n\nI mentioned to my desk-mate I\u2019m doing this out of my own pocket as well as our other co-workers and I don\u2019t mind doing it but she hasn\u2019t gotten coffee anybody once but has given her order out every time somebody offers a coffee run.  Some of my co-workers have also started asking her for money for it since it\u2019s costs roughly $4-5 more than what all of the other orders.  \n\nShe said she understood but still orders the same thing without changing or trying to cut back on the cost.  This week I offered getting coffee for anyone who wants it privately to everyone without letting her know of the offer.  I ran out and got the coffee and we ran into each other when I was coming in and she asks why I didn\u2019t ask her.\n\nI told her that her order is too expensive for her to constantly be asking others to buy her for free and I thought she shouldn\u2019t be getting coffee for free if she wasn\u2019t going to pitch in. She gets mad and tells me I\u2019m purposely excluding her and it\u2019s not her fault that I offered getting coffee for the office for free.  \n\nI walked off and continued doing my work till I finished and I didn\u2019t acknowledge her for the rest of the day.

A couple of summers ago, in Peru, I took my fianc\u00e9s family out for a meal, and one of his older sisters, plus her husband, took the opportunity to order extra meals to take home.

How does offering to purchase a drink turn into her giving you a full order including pastries?", "NTA because she\u2019s a mooch, but in my country not including her in the coffee run could be construed as bullying if she wanted to be an AH about it. Which she probably would, given that she\u2019s already proved she is one.\n\nYou could always just get her an ordinary coffee, the same one you bought yourself, for example. Then you\u2019re not excluding her, but not paying over the odds either. And don\u2019t buy pastries unless she pays you upfront. Pastries aren\u2019t coffee, and you\u2019re buying coffees.\n\nAs to getting her to pitch in to do a coffee run herself, that\u2019s a more difficult call. You (plural you, as in the office) could try saying that if she wants to be included she has to do her fair share of them.

If she doesn't pay, she gets coffee only.", "Eeeehhhhhhhhhh... Probably could have nipped this in the bud by putting a limit on what you're willing to spend.

Just say, \"Hey, I don't mind buying you a drink, but keep it under $X.\"", "This is correct; unfortunately, correct doesn\u2019t always equate to a good idea in office politics. Right now she has a legit (if stupid) complaint at being excluded, should she go to HR. Malicious compliance / petty bureaucracy is your friend here.\n\nOptions include: \n\n1. Announce a new coffee \u201cclub\u201d with other office mates. All people must first buy [the minimum number of times you are sure everyone else has already bought already] before they can join in as a beneficiary. Be very happy to hear she\u2019s interested, and excitedly tell her that she only has [x] number of runs to rack up to be in and you\u2019re all graciously willing to let her do them in a row for the next couple weeks so she can join ASAP. \n\n2. Announce a limit on coffee runs: $X per order or whatever. If she orders something more expensive just say unfortunately that\u2019s over the limit. No can do. If she asks why, tell her in a conspiratorial whisper (with a 100% straight face) that you\u2019re not one to gossip but, ahem, apparently someone has been abusing other people\u2019s generosity, if she can believe that. You\u2019re certain she of all people understands and my gosh, what is the world coming too these days?! So sad, kids today. [The younger you are and the older she is, the funnier this one will be.]\n\n3. Ask everyone to pay up front for a couple weeks. When you go around to collect the money, suddenly remember (if she\u2019s in earshot) that you owe Joe $4.15 from breakfast last week, and Sally \u20ac2.89 for the pack of gum she bought you over the weekend. Also, funny enough you owe Sam \u00a33 for the meter he fed for you last Tuesday. Shucks, it\u2019s a wash for each of them, but not her. \n\n4. Get her the same latte (or whatever) everyone else gets. Feign confusion and say you\u2019re sure that\u2019s what she ordered. Or swear you told the barista her exact order and don\u2019t know what happened. Do this repeatedly. Be very apologetic. When she gets mad, offer to let her do the next coffee run herself to \u201cmake sure it gets done right this time.\u201d Wonder idly if the barista is messing with you, and start getting really worked up about the possibility if she keeps pushing you about her order. Bonus points if you can misuse the term gaslighting here. \n\n5. Announce you\u2019re picking up lattes and refreshers - anyone who wants one, let you know. If she says she wants an iced coffee with eight add ons just shrug and say your psychic advised you only order those drinks on days ending in y, and you take these things *very* seriously. If she pushes, give her a very serious but baleful look and ask her if she was aware that Mercury is currently in retrograde?\n\n6. Announce tearfully that your dear departed aunt\u2019s cousin\u2019s dog walker\u2019s nephew drank [whatever she orders] and you just can\u2019t bear to order that kind of drink. You are *so* sorry but you are *sure* she understands your pain.  \n\n7. Don\u2019t buy any food items she requests. When she asks where they are, announce guiltily that they smelled so good you couldn\u2019t help yourself, and you ate them in the car on the way back.
