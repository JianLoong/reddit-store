It\u2019s a very nice company and my co-workers have been nothing but nice to me so I\u2019ve been running out during my lunch to grab people coffee.  I\u2019m not super rich but I\u2019m comfortable enough to do this a few times a month out of my own pocket.\n\nI started doing it the first month I worked there to be friendly and made able to make conversation with co-workers I didn\u2019t know and it worked fantastic.  Now, other co-workers have been doing this too so there\u2019s usually a coffee run once or twice a week.\n\nMost of my co-workers just get plain lattes or refreshers but not my desk-mate. My desk-mate asks for an ice coffee with all types of extras on it (which makes it more expensive) as well as a few pastries.  You do you, but she only orders this and my other co-workers have gotten annoyed with it too.  \n\nI mentioned to my desk-mate I\u2019m doing this out of my own pocket as well as our other co-workers and I don\u2019t mind doing it but she hasn\u2019t gotten coffee anybody once but has given her order out every time somebody offers a coffee run.  Some of my co-workers have also started asking her for money for it since it\u2019s costs roughly $4-5 more than what all of the other orders.  \n\nShe said she understood but still orders the same thing without changing or trying to cut back on the cost.  This week I offered getting coffee for anyone who wants it privately to everyone without letting her know of the offer.  I ran out and got the coffee and we ran into each other when I was coming in and she asks why I didn\u2019t ask her.\n\nI told her that her order is too expensive for her to constantly be asking others to buy her for free and I thought she shouldn\u2019t be getting coffee for free if she wasn\u2019t going to pitch in. She gets mad and tells me I\u2019m purposely excluding her and it\u2019s not her fault that I offered getting coffee for the office for free.  \n\nI walked off and continued doing my work till I finished and I didn\u2019t acknowledge her for the rest of the day.

If she \"puts in her order\" again, collect her money for it. You would already be doing her a favor by picking it up.", "NTA. Sounds like there are several people in the office who take turns buying coffee. This coworker sounds like she just accepts coffee but never takes her turn to treat the office.

You offered 8 bucks, they can take or leave the generous offer.\n\nIf you are feeling solicitous, let your coworker know you're heading to Pete's.  Offer to pick up if she places an order by phone or online.\n\nI just think clarifying the terms of the offer can avoid a lot of misunderstanding.  Also, when someone offers this to me, I sometimes am unsure how much is ok (that cat knows tho) and a guideline would make me more comfortable accepting.\n\n$8 is an example, whatever it is for you.", "INFO: when people ask her for money to cover her more expensive order, does she give it to them?", "NTA, it sounds like she knows exactly what she\u2019s doing and is deliberately taking advantage of people.", "NTA, your deskmate is not someone who I would like to but coffee for. \n\nYou can make this all much easier: ask your boss to install a decent coffee machine which can be used for free by all employees.

The worst and most counterproductive mistake an employer can make: be stingy about good coffee.", "NTA\n\nIn situations like this, when you are dining/drinking on someone else's dime, if you are respectful and have common sense, you don't order something fancy.  She is violating that bottom-line expectation of respect.", "It can be awkward but NTA. She doesn\u2019t forget to pitch in at least, she just doesn\u2019t want to. Well, hopefully what you did would give her some reality check or at least she\u2019d say \u201cIt\u2019s my turn to treat you guys.\u201d (Then all of you order extra so she\u2019d taste her own medicine, hahaha.)", "NTA- she is abusing others generosity.  Period.  And is well aware of what she is doing.", "NTA An alternative is that she just gets a pastry and no coffee since her order is ridiculous and more expensive than everyone else's. Don't even ask, just do it and then she can't complain that you didn't include her.", "ESH. Honestly, if it is a regular thing between you, put a cap on how much an order should be. It has become a passive aggressive thing now. Your colleague orders all the trimmings but has not broken any rule, technically. So, put a cap on it or stop doing it altogether. Petty things like that make office work so intolerable.", "ESH you two still need to keep it civil. And you could do something like say \u201cI\u2019m only going to get coffees\u201d (not the pastries) but I agree I wouldn\u2019t be getting her complicated order when everyone else is just having coffee!\n\nEdit: changing my vote to be more aligned with the rest of my comment", "ESH\n\nYou're either offering to get everyone coffee out of the goodness of your heart and friendliness, or you're not. If she orders coffee and a bunch of extras, you can say \"oh! I can only cover the coffee. Do you still want that on its own, or do you want to give me some cash to cover the extras?\" \n\nOr. You're starting a coffee club that folks who want to partake in pay into, and everyone takes turns going out for the coffee run pick up. \n\nWhat she's doing sucks, and there are often those who are selfishly going to abuse the kindness of others. But you can't offer to get no-strings-attached free coffee for everyone but her.", "Ahaha. I kinda enjoy it whenever people get what is coming to them. If she did offer to pick up for everyone you would all be justified to each ask for pastries as well. \n\nE S H, you could always pick up a basic version of what coffee she likes but no pastries. That would include her without bowing to her manipulation.\n\nEdit: NTA - thanks for the additional info.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She apparently missed the lesson about how rude it is to  take advantage of generosity. My sister is the same way. If my parents were paying for the meal, she ordered the most expensive meal, plus all the drinks. A lot of people take advantage of situations. A couple of summers ago, in Peru, I took my fianc\u00e9s family out for a meal, and one of his older sisters, plus her husband, took the opportunity to order extra meals to take home.  I didn't want to cause any problems, plus I could afford it, so I let it go. She has a history of being an AH, though.", "NTA. But stop worrying about her all together and replace coffee runs with inviting people to go grab coffee with you.\n\nYou'll build much better relationships going to pick up coffee together (even if you pay separately) than if you are buying it for them. It's much easier to build rapport with colleagues away from work, which then in turn makes your working relationship better.", "Why don't you collect money from everyone when you take their order, then give anyone who orders one normal coffee their money back when you drop off their drinks? \n\nNTA", "No worries about the $8 example; you clearly live where Peet's coffee is a thing so you are in a HCOL area.", "No.  She said she would but then forgot or just didn\u2019t.", "She hasn't broken a rule? A rule of what, OP's generosity? There are no rules, OP is nice enough to do this a few times a month at their own discretion. She was asked nicely once, that should be enough for any reasonable person.", "I thought I have been keeping it fairly civil but the only coffees is a good idea to try.", "Lol, I don't drink coffee or know Pete!  Il get you big gulps down the corner store tho.  $2 on me \ud83e\udd91", "I think you can solve it by just collecting the money per order each go before the coffee run. Everyone is already essentially paying their serving already. And this way she can't complain people leaving her out. If she refuses or forgets to have cash then no coffee for her.\n\nOr just ignore her :) she's the asshole.", "Yeah I guess what I meant is that you stopped acknowledging her and can\u2019t do that for very long since you do work together. Like at the workplace it has to be civil even, you know, when some people are jerks", "It's Peet not Pete. Started in Berkeley in the 1960s; now pretty prevalent in CA and western states and available at many supermarkets nationwide.\n\n(As they say in the Bay Area, friends don't let friends drink Starbucks).", "Yeah, I do agree that not acknowledging her isn\u2019t civil and it isn\u2019t a long term solution at all.", "ESH. A simple \"Hey, that's $X more than what the others of us are getting. I'm happy to pick it up for you if you pay me the difference...or full price....or whatever you want to say here.\"\n\nCommunication is crucial and prevents drama and a possible HR situation. But this is reddit, so of course good communication is going to get down voted.", "NTA. \n\nI buy my office coffee (6-8 people depending on the schedule) 2-3 times a month. All of my coworkers also offer to get everyone coffee several times a month. Someone is always getting everyone coffee. When its my turn, I always ask everyone. Every one of them offers to give me cash/Venmo me, every time. I decline, every time. Because we all treat equally and I feel it is fair. \n\nWe had someone work with us for a while who never treated. So unless our bosses were the ones treating, she didn't get asked what she wanted because she never got us anything. She figured it out and started treating occasionally and we started asking her again. All was well. \n\nYour coworker should have just learned from the situation and been grateful for the treats up until that point.", "We had a free coffee/tea etc machine at work (still do, I think, but I never use it). When I first started working there, I was too scared to ask around what everyone wanted (what if I forgot the \u201corders\u201d? I\u2019d get so anxious when I saw someone getting up to start the drinks run, that I\u2019d get up and go to the bathroom), so when anyone asked if I wanted a drink I would always decline. If I wasn\u2019t getting the drinks in, I wouldn\u2019t expect anyone else to get mine.\n\n(Eventually, I was kind of pressured into doing the drinks run, and when I came back without a drink for myself, they all made a furore about the fact that I didn\u2019t get anything. After that they left me alone.)", "I did try to do that the second time and I didn\u2019t buy a pastry for her as well as cut down on some of the extras for the drink but she said the drink was undrinkable because I ruined it and passive aggressively told me I forgot her pastry.", "I have communicated with her about it without it being too rude because the last thing I want is HR having to get involved.  I thought telling her order is a lot more than the others without pitching in would get her to take a hint but I guess not.", "Well maybe you guys should include her but \u201cforget\u201d the expensive pastries then.  \n\n\nI think you guys took the nuclear option when you should have escalated to the next step of still offering but refusing to meet the excessive request.  \n\nI\u2019m doing a coffee run and I\u2019ll get you a coffee, that\u2019s it.  If you want more you can give me money now.  And if she still pitches a fit then she should be entirely excluded.", "That's a piece of work right there. Give her some caramel and mocha syrups for Christmas, from all. Passive aggressively. If you feel like it's worth another thought. \n\nChanging my verdict if she can't take that strong of a hint, wow. Just wow.", "Lol, that's just the name I made for my hypotheticals.  You told me bout Peet's.  Could have said Dave's.  Didn't mean confusion.", "I'm from Seattle and I hate Starbucks. I always preferred Torefazione at the B&O Cafe", "Lol there's actually Dave's coffee in Rhode Island.", "I lived in Eugene awhile so, still don't drink, but buzz was always Dutch Bros.\n\nIn IL now.  The big debate is Starbucks or Dunkin here.  Couple nice locals but no trendy brands.", "So, I says to my buddies.

No\u2026it\u2019s not her fault that you offered to get coffee. It *is* her fault for continuing to order the most expensive  my coffee drink on the menu.", "NTA but just start a \"Thursday Coffee Club\" or whatever. You designate weeks that someone is to make the run, cycling through all members. If someone misses their week, they're off the list until they buy their way back in. Publish the list in advance with many weeks scheduled out. Keep it posted in a common area and email it. Hold people accountable.", "NTA.  You made a generous offer.  Others in the office have kept their orders within reason and have been reciprocally generous.  She is taking advantage of your generosity to go way over the top with her order while never funding the coffee run like other people.  If you had a coffee fund jar by a coffee maker in your office, she wouldn't contribute to that, either.  She's a moocher.  Don't let her mooch off you.", "NTA but depending on your workplace she might have a legitimate complaint that you are excluding her. Even if you have a good reason - her order is expensive and she never makes a run - you\u2019re still offering to all your coworkers but her. Not a great look. \n\nI would request that she pay you every time for the more expensive drink and if she doesn\u2019t, then you can decline to pick up for her. You\u2019re offering to treat her to the same drink as everyone else, she\u2019s the one refusing and asking for more.", "NTA. It\u2019s not her fault that you offered AND you can stop buying it whenever you want.", "NTA\n\nYou can stop doing coffee altogether, deal with her complaining about exclusion, or her the cheapest coffee on the menu so all she can do is whine about how you got her complicated order wrong.", "NTA.  The pastries got me.  Wtf??", "I just don\u2019t get how people could be like that. I actually hate when somebody is paying for me coz I get worried if I\u2019m ordering something too expensive.", "You're not being downvoted because you're emphasizing communication. You're being downvoted because you're calling OP an AH, which they're not. In fact, they specifically said that they had communicated with their desk mate about the expensive orders she is placing, and nothing changed.\n\nNTA.", "Down in Vancouver, and I prefer Black Rock.", "Minnesota, and I like Caribou Coffee", "Oh for the love of Peet!"]}
