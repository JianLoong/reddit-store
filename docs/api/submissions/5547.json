I let them live with me because I love K a lot, but Anastasia and I have a tense relationship, now I'm a farely religious Christian but I am open-minded and don't hate LGBTQ+ people, but I don't think she understands that or she chooses not to, as she sometimes accuses me of homophobia when she gets angry, which hurts me a lot because K is my world and I wouldn't dare do that.\n\nAnastasia has been a bad influence on K. My daughter has become very different recently, she gets extremely heated when talking about politics, which is extremely strange to me as she never used to be concerned with politics before, she even used to joke a lot about people who take politics too seriously being stupid.\n\nAnastasia has been living with us up until now, but she's barely bothered to help me with utility bills or food costs, and I do know she has an okay paying job now, and should have already moved out with what her and K make, but I guess its easier to save money by freeloading off me. I've put up with this because I understood Anastasia's position, but now that K has changed so much because of her, I feel like she is taking my daughter away from me and changing her.\n\nThat leads us to yesterday, Anastasia came back home with K after a party and I'm pissed since we had relatives coming and I told K to be there. I tell Anastasia that I'm can't believe she dragged K with her to the party even though I specifically asked K to stay so we could meet with family, the argument escalated and I'm not okay with sharing what happened in it, but it got pretty heated. Anastasia fell on her old excuse, and she insulted me by calling me homophobic again, at this point I'm done with her shit and I'm offended that she thinks this just because of my religious affiliation, I shoot back at her and say that I'm sorry but she has to leave my house in 2 weeks or else I'll get her evicted, K seems shocked I said that.\n\nNow this is the part I may be the AH, I tell her she's she's freeloader and has only been using my generosity to her advantage and has been manipulating K. K yells at me and she says that if Anastasia's getting out then she's leaving too, I tell her I'm fine with that and I don't want to ever see Anastasia ever again.\n\nI'm writing this in my break right now, and my family is messaging me saying that I went too far and should not have gone so far to kick them both out when it is almost Christmas, but in my opinion, they can both support themselves and have been freeloading off me for a while now.\n\nSo reddit AITA.\n\nTL;DR: Daughter's GF has been living for basically free with me, I got sick of her insulting me and kicked them both out.", "created_utc": 1671903798, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zuepih/aita_for_kicking_my_lesbian_daughter_and_her_gf/", "score": 2154, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter is an adult. She should have taken responsibility and made sure she turned up. You should have been having that argument with your daughter. \n\nRe politics, at 21 it's very very normal for someone to start getting more interested in politics. Again, that's not Anastasia's fault. \n\nWhen a child starts to change, it's very easy for the parents to blame their child's partner, rather than accept their child is changing and making choices the parent doesn't agree with.", "Info: we really can\u2019t judge this without knowing anything that you have said that Anastasia has accused you of homophobia for. \n\nIf it\u2019s something like you told K to clean up the kitchen and Anastasia said you\u2019re homophobic, that\u2019s ridiculous. But if it\u2019s something like you asked them to not show PDA in public when you don\u2019t mind straight couples doing it, that\u2019s homophobic. A lot of people have implicit biases, so you may be saying some homophobic things even if you don\u2019t realize it. But the fact that you won\u2019t actually tell us what you said that has prompted Anastasia to call you homophobic makes me think that you may know you are saying homophobic things and purposefully omitting them so the judgements go in your favor", "Lots of missing missing reasons here. Why does A think you\u2019re a homophobe? Why was K supposed to stay to see the visitors, but not A? What happened in that fight? Why do you think A is manipulating K?", "Methinks this \"fairly religious christian\" man is upset his daughter is confident of her queer identity and active in the politics surrounding queer issues because, oh, I don't know, she's queer and those politics don't align with daddy's. Having an interest in politics isn't a bad thing, especially not for queer people who constantly must be on edge because of \"fairly religious christian men\" trying to take their rights away. So you kicked out your daughters girlfriend who you at the very least disagree politically with and that's me taking you at your word that you aren't a homophobe (which I doubt), and then told your daughter it was because she was manipulative and a bad influence. Your daughter is 21, not 12. That means you don't get to decide who she dates, as much as it appeals to your christian sensibilities. If this was ACTUALLY about them not contributing to the household, there where a million better ways to go about it where you might not have looked like an asshole. Too late for that. YTA.\n\nEditing this comment to add since several people have brought it up, the fact that he allowed his daughter and her girlfriend to live with him does not make him incapable of homophobia. At all. Tons of queer people live with/rely on parents who do not support their identities.", "Yeahhhh\u2026 why did she call you homophobic? Let\u2019s start there.\n\nYou won\u2019t be going to hell just because you support your daughter and any other person in the LGBTQ+ community. I promise. I\u2019ve talked to god and he said he doesn\u2019t gaf.", "YTA.\n\nA few red flags here, Anastasia probably didn't drag K to a party. They went together. K is an adult. K is probably not more engaged with politics because of Anastasia, it's more likely that politics in general are more heated and some politicians have been very anti and very pro LGBT recently. Politics likely has more direct affect on K's life, which is driving her interest. You seem to be struggling with K growing up and becoming and independent adult and you're choosing to blame Anastasia rather than facing that fact.\n\nYou're use of the word freeloading seems concerning too. Did you set clear expectations for utilities and other bills beforehand, or have you only brought it up since you've been having disagreements with Anastasia? Do you talk about bills with both women, or only Anastasia?\n\nFinally, kicking them out right before Christmas and proclaiming you never want to see your daughter's partner again is immature and vindictive. \n\nGiven all of the above and that you left out a lot of details, details I'm guessing aren't very flattering to you, you've definitely crossed a line here.", "I\u2019m going with YTA. While Anastasia should show respect I believe there is merit in her claim of saying you are homophobic. You are also an AH for saying Anastasia is a bad influence on K because K is now into politics. Assuming that you guys are in the US, politics concerning the LGBTQ community is a big deal. K should concern herself with politics because politicians are actively advocating to strip the LGBTQ community of their rights. You are in the right for deciding who can or can\u2019t be in your home but you are an AH for everything else. Also depending on where you are they may have tenants rights.\n\nEdited for typos.", "Lemme guess - You don't feel comfortable sharing what happened in the argument because you said things you regret?\n\nYou sound like my mother - she's not religious, nor is she homophobic, as long as people don't \"shove it down her throat.\" She loved saying Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve before I came out, and she doesn't understand people who get too heated about politics because \"none of it effects me anyway.\" (Note, she went five years without realizing gay marriage was legal. She went to her *only daughter's wedding* thinking it wasn't legal. Amazing what happens when you don't pay attention.)\n\nYTA, it sounds like you were looking for a reason to kick Anastasia out. Enjoy no contact!", "I'm going with YTA. You're focusing on your daughter's sexuality, despite claiming it doesn't bother you, and seem upset that she's got her own political ideas that are different from yours and is growing into her personality. You also won't share what was said during the argument, but WILL share that it ended with you being called homophobic. I think there's way more to this story than you're sharing, especially because you seem to have never asked for contribution to the bills, so I think that's just an excuse for you.", "YTA, not for asking them to leave or being upset that they weren't contributing, but for the way you went about it.  \n\n1. Two weeks is not long enough, especially at this time of year.  \n2. You kicked them out right before Christmas.\n3. It also doesn't sound as though you set realistic expectations, before exploding and going with the extreme option.  \n4. You told your daughter you don't want to see her romantic partner ever again.  If she marries Anastasia, you can say goodbye to ever seeing your daughter again, too.  Or their children, if they have any.  \n\nI have to say, I don't really buy that you weren't being homophobic, either.  And, of course, your daughter is getting into politics!  There are politicians out there who are actively trying to take away her rights!", "Her being more active in politics recently might have nothing to do with her gf and everything to do with the horror show of women's rights being taken away recently.  Even if she isn't from the US it's still horrifying to think something like that could happen and wanting to be active to maybe help prevent it from happening elsewhere.  If it started before that it could be due to the person that was previously in office (if US)", "NTA. Regardless of their sexuality or your religion they are freeloading.

You should not have to walk on eggshells around your own home. I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t agree with most of your politics either, but I\u2019m not sponging off you.", "Why is the fact that they're lesbian so important in this?\n\nYou were fed up with your child and their partner so you wanted them to move out... sexual orientation doesn't matter here, but since it's such a big deal in your mind, YTA", "\"I'm not okay sharing what was said \" \n*immediately shares the thing anastasia said he didn't like*\nSo you're not comfortable sharing what YOU said, right OP? Reckon way take a guess or two there....\nLeaving out relevant info to try and cast yourself in a better light is instant YTA territory, if you ask me.", "From exactly what your wrote n t a but I have a feeling this is a case of missing details. Even as you tried to give us a stealizied retelling there's micro-agressions strewn throughout. You didn't have to say \"my lesbian daughter and her gf\" we're all capable of inferring they're lesbians since they're dating. Your phrasing drips with disdain so I'm going with my gut that yea, you're a homophobic AH\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou don't sound overtly bigoted, but your stereotyping of Anastasia and K as \"dumb liberals\" betrays your bias towards conservative values. Ironically, you have thrown out your daughter on Christmas, how very Christian of you. You claim that they are freeloading, but you've also admitted that you wouldn't mind them staying if they had different politics. You and your kind give the rest of us Christians a bad name. Repent before it is too late.", ">My daughter has become very different recently, she gets extremely heated when talking about politics, which is extremely strange to me as she never used to be concerned with politics before, she even used to joke a lot about people who take politics too seriously being stupid.\n\nYou mean she went from being largely insulated to the effects of \"politics\" and has figured out she doesn't like people trying to take away her rights? \n\n>now that K has changed so much because of her, I feel like she is taking my daughter away from me and changing her.\n\nYour daughter is growing up, becoming an adult and her own person.\n\nYTA", "I feel details are also missing. But to be fair I've seen a lot of seen a lot of individuals throw the homophobia or racist card at ppl to manipulate the narrative in their favor. Guilt others with it and pretty much weaponize it anyway they can. \n\nYour daughter is also an age where shes experiencing homophobia and seeing her community being attacked by politicians and the Christians.  She's going to grow as an Individual and is clearly becoming more politically motivated in order to protect herself and hopefully enlighten others.\n\nSo I too am suspicious as to what was said that you don't want to disclose here.  Your daughter and her gf might be completely justified. \n\nAt the same time, anyone living with you for free shouldn't be abusive and disrespectful towards you. You have every right to kick someone out of your home. \n\nSo I can't really say which way to lean here without the missing info.", "Your daughter is 21. That\u2019s a fairly normal time to get into politics.

Otherwise this is all missing missing reasons.", "INFO: What exactly did you say during the argument? You glossed over that part but it seems pretty important to determine if you are TA or not.

You don\u2019t say you\u2019re an ally or supporter, but that you don\u2019t hate. That phrasing plus your vagueness around politics and the fact that Anastasia has accused you of homophobia makes me think you might be just that.\n\nYour daughter is allowed to have her own political views and you shouldn\u2019t blame that on one person. She\u2019s growing and changing and seeing the world for herself. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s fair to accuse them of freeloading either if the agreement was that they could stay for free. If you\u2019d like them to help out financially that is fine, but it needs to be communicated to them and not just resentment building on your part without saying why.", "YTA I'm getting strong \"unreliable narrator\" vibes from this post and I have a feeling there's more to the story that's missing. But, either way, you're definitely the asshole for kicking them out without any sort of warning. And right before Christmas? Heartless.\n\nAlso, your daughter is part of the LGBT community. A group that is dealing with a very real threat of losing important rights. How oblivious are you to think they have no reason to care about politics in the current political climate?!?!\n\nPlus, your whole thing about being \"fairly religious.\" And the way you leave out so many important details and focus on the oddest things.

It removes the sense of responsibility for who we each are, how we grow as individuals and how a parent relates to their child. It's rug sweeping at it's best.\n\nHowever, if Anastasia and K are not contributing financially, despite having a regular income, they are wrong. Adults contribute to their upkeep. Simple.\n\nOP ... I would strongly suggest that you do some very reflective thinking about your attitude towards your daughter.  She is making her OWN choices about her life, and just blaming a bad influence is not giving your own daughter the respect she deserves as a human being.  \n\nWhat's worse is that if \"other influences\" is how you raised your daughter, she is likely less able to stand up for her own beliefs because of your own conditioning.  You have taught her not to think for herself. This one is up to you to change, and it starts with you changing how you relate to her.\n\nGood luck.", "\u201cI tell Anastasia that I\u2019m can\u2019t believe\u201d idk but this autocorrect fail strikes me as you typing out something else originally but realized that it made you sound AHish so you tried rewriting it to sound better.\n\nYTA.

I\u2019m annoyed by how my daughter has gotten more passionate about politics and we disagree a lot there, but it\u2019s not about that\u2026 it\u2019s solely the free-loading. So I kicked them out.\u2019", "INFO: what was said in the argument.\n\nTo be clear, you are not an asshole for wanting them to pay their share of utilities.

That\u2019s pretty clear.\nThe tittle was unnecessary", "I don't think you are an AH for wanting a freeloading adult child and her irritating partner out of your house.  However, it seems like you have handled this very poorly and may have done some AH things in the course of these arguments.\n\nAssuming that, I recommend you start by apologizing for whatever ugly things you may have said in the heat of the moment.  This should go something like, \"I lost my temper and said some mean-spirited things that I should not have said.  K, I love you.  I don't love you any less or differently for being gay.  You are a grown woman and can choose your own romantic partner, and I will always do my best to accept and include that person.  We have some things we need to talk about, but let's just enjoy Christmas and talk about those things in the next couple of weeks.\"\n\nThen, schedule a time to talk with your daughter.  The topic of this conversation should be, \"I would like you to move out by March 1.  You are grown, and it is important for you to get some experience living on your own.  Also, I would like to enjoy some time of having the house to myself.\"  This doesn't have to be a fight.  It can be a conversation where you set a boundary/expectation.  K is moving into a new stage of life as a young adult, and you are moving into a new \"empty nest\" stage.  Both of those stages have new growth experiences that you should be having.\n\nIt's very important to separate your feelings about 1) your daughter is gay 2) your daughter is growing up and some of her ideas (like about politics) are changing 3) your daughter has a romantic partner you don't like very much and 4) your daughter is growing up and won't necessarily be at your beck and call for things like family gatherings and 5) your daughter is living with you and taking advantage.   By letting these issues run together and fester you end up breaking out in arguments instead of discussing actual solvable problems in a reasonable way.\n\nIt can be a weird transition when young adult children live with you because they are sort of kids and sort of grown.  My sons admitted that when they moved home for a while they fell into immature patterns of letting me take responsibility for everything or resenting having to do family activities.  Since it isn't financially necessary for your daughter and her partner to live with you, there really isn't any reason to stay in this \"limbo.\"  Send her out of the nest.", "you didn't have to specify lesbian daughter when you already added the girlfriend part. the fact you purposely added the word lesbian makes me think you are homophobic so even without reading im giving you YTA", "It's totally fine to decide that circumstances, or just your feelings, have changed and you are no longer willing to house other adults rent-free. 2 weeks is a rough timeline though, and moreso this time of year. It doesn't seem from your post that the primary reason for you wanting them out is that finances have changed but because you have a personal issue with your daughter's relationship. It seems to me you're being half-willfully evasive about the nature of that personal issue - \"I won't explain what I said or did that caused Anastasia to say I'm homophobic\" and half in denial yourself about your stance.\n\n* Right in the title, you said \"my lesbian daughter\" when \"my daughter\" would totally have sufficed. Do you qualify your straight family members this way when referring to them? On a really basic level you think being a lesbian is outside the norm and needs to be pointed out. If you need an analogy that may help, think how insulting it is to say \"lady doctor\" instead of just \"doctor\", it implies that \"regular\" doctors aren't women.\n* Anastasia has repeatedly called you homophobic. You won't share details about what led her to say that, which leads me to believe that on some level you know sharing those details won't make you look good. You don't think you're homophobic, but you're worried if you're transparent about the situation, we will think you are. That's telling. If she called you homophobic over absolutely nothing, you'd tell us. \"I just poured myself a cup of coffee and she said I was homophobic! It's crazy!\"\n* You're blaming Anastasia for things your daughter is choosing to do - like attend a party or care about political issues. Unless this is actually an abusive, manipulative relationship (it sure could be, but I don't see evidence of that in what you've chosen to share with us) or Anastasia actually *physically* dragged K to the party, that was her choice and if it upsets you, you need to address it with her.\n* The things you're upset about your adult daughter doing are attending a party and caring about politics. Can you imagine why someone who is a member of an oppressed minority group would get passionate about political issues that directly impact her human rights, at a time when many of the people in power are actively trying to strip those rights away? Wild. Regardless of if you can understand where she's coming from, not cool to want to control your adult daughters beliefs or punish her when they differ from yours.\n\nThis is probably not a healthy living situation for anyone to continue in. But unless someone is in danger or causing actual harm, you should give them a reasonable amount of time to find a new living situation, and 2 weeks starting Christmas day is not it.\n\nYou should also start making a serious effort to repair your relationship with your daughter, and that starts with taking a good look at yourself, your relationship, and with respecting who she is. It's not enough to say I'm ok with her being a lesbian as long as she's not too political, or as long as she dates someone who I like, or as long as she chooses to spend time with the people I want her to instead of her own friends. Giving them more time to find a new living situation will also give you time to start doing the hard work of building up your relationship with your daughter back to a good place. Kicking them out with little notice and without doing any of the work to improve your relationship may mean that's the last time you see your daughter.\n\nGood luck.
