So naturally he shares a lot of hobbies with me and likes to tag along whenever I go do anything recreational. About 3 years ago I got married to my now wife and got a step daughter. She was pretty shy and didn't really interact with me much so our relationship never really developed much past being friendly too each other.\n\nSo the other day my wife brought up how my step daughter felt left out of family activities since it was usually just me and my son doing things. I told her theres not much i can do if she doesn't open up more and express that she wants to tag along. This devolved into a pretty big argument about how I was supposed to take initiative to make her feel more included.

Good lord, YTA by a pretty big margin, bud.", "INFO.\n\nWhat is the step daughter\u2019s relationship to her dad?  Do they do stuff together?", "YTA.  You can't invite her out to get ice cream, a movie, a walk, etc?  You are the adult and need to be the one to reach out and establish a relationship.", "INFO: how old are the children and is your step daughters dad involved at all?", "Nta- your son comes first. U can include the step daughter but dont let that ruin or lesson the time with your son.", "Your wife could plan things you can all do together - instead of just criticizing? \n\nNTA. Developing relationships is work - not magic. She has to put the nurturing time in with your for her daughter's sake. Again - its not magic.", "NTA\nSo many people quick to judge here.\nWould like to know more before the OP is condemned. Has she been invited initially and declined? Did the OP try and include her initially in the activities? Does the wife do anything with the son? Was the OP aware his stepdaughter was upset before his wife confronted him?\n\nFrom the information given, we don\u2019t know the whole situation. Hopefully, they can move forward and do more family inclusive activities.", "yeah you kinda are TA\n\nyou do something recreational. for yourself. Your son enjoying the same stuff is a nice coincidence, but you spending time with him is more like a side effect. \n\nTo be frank, kids have interests vastly different from yours. Believe me, parents all over the world low-key (or high key) force themselves to: watch kids movies and shows, watch kid friendly youtube channels or twitch streams, play children's games, play dress-up and let their kids braid their hair and or apply makeup to their faces, go out to amusement parks, ball pits, laser tag, you name it. Not because they particularly enjoy that activity recreationally, but because they want to and enjoy to bond with their children. \n\nJust show interest in whatever she is doing and ask if YOU may tag along. Figure out what she is into, and then plan something for her. Also with your son.", "YTA.\n\nIt's nice to hear your son and you have certain hobbies that you both like to do, truly! However, part of having (step-)kids is that you adjust your activities to what **they** like to do. This means the onus is on you to think of either things to do with the entire family, or things that you could do with your stepdaughter. Mind you: They don't have to be things you particularly enjoy. I've done plenty of things that were boring as F with my kid when he was little, because **he** enjoyed them. That's one of the parts of being a parent.\n\nYou can't expect a child who is put into a new situation and who is, from the sounds of it, pretty shy, to actively express she wants to **be involved** (not 'tag along) in an activity you and your son are excited about.\n\nBe a parent.", "YTA let the child be a child & you be the adult & invite her to do things with just you @ then with you & your son. Smh.", "YTA She's shy. A member of the family. \n\nYou're an adult making her earn her place.\n\nBehave like an adult. Spend some time with her. Invite her to something she might be interested in.\n\nFamilies don't exclude!", "YTA, you're not treating her the way you treat normal family, you're making her earn her invitation on a family outing. Please also spend time with your son just the two of you, but also spend time with just her. You are finding excuses to not include her when the truth is you don't want to.", "YTA\n\nYou are the adult so the onus to take initiative us weighted heavily towards you. Like 90% you 10% her.\n\nIt's not on her to interact with you to build a relationship with you, it's on you as the adult to build a relationship with her.\n\nIt's not on her to express she wants to tag along, it's on you to express you want her company.\n\nThe fact you said that there was not much you can do made me feel so sorry for her and confused how you came to that conclusion. Like you think a relationship with her is her doing all the work while your contribution is... what... being receptive to all the work she puts in?", "YTA - I've been the stepchild ignored because \"I'm not part of the family.\" You say this isn't the reason, truth is, you don\u2019t see her as your family and never will", "YTA. Don't isolate your step daughter, involve her. She will appreciate it and you'll develop a great bond, family is everything, don't deprive her of that.", "YTA - Put into action what makes her welcomed to hang out with you. It can include time with the 3 or 4 of you or just 1:1. Yes, are to take initiative especially knowing how the daughter feels. You married to blend a family; get to it.", "YTA - she doesn\u2019t ask to go because you don\u2019t make her feel welcome.  \nAsking her to go with you would make her feel welcome.", "You stated she was pretty shy.  As an introvert I can confirm its very difficult for me to bond with a new person. You will have to go out of your way to make them feel included. This is not a bro lunch and whoever wants to come can come type of deal.  It's a young, impressionable kid. All this kid is going to think is I am just the step kid and only tolerated because of the mother. \n\nShame on you man.   You sound exactly like my stepdad and that brings back crap memories. \n\nYATA. Its your kid not your buddy.", "YTA for leaving it up to the stepchild to ask. \n\nYou're the stepparent, an adult, you should extend the invitation, you should take the initiative.\n\nAs adults it is up to YOU to assist in the integration of the new family. You and your wife need to be doing more to build relationship with the kids. you don't leave it up to the children to reach out and ask, you need to do the work so the kids feel safe and comfortable. \nShe hasn't asked because you failed to include her, you have to let her know that she can ask. I'm guessing she feels like she would be intruding.", "Info: it's unclear from the post, which one of you is the child here, you or the step daughter?", "YTA. It's a simple matter of: Hey, SD, would you like to go on a walk? or Let's go to a movie, just the two of us. What you would you like to see?\n\nThose sorts of things don't require a lot of time or brain power. I suggest you start there. Maybe it might jumpstart your empathy and initiative a bit.", "You shouldn't have gotten married if you weren't willing to be a family.", "NTA if it\u2019s just you and your son it\u2019s not a family event it\u2019s a father son event. If wife went with you and son with SD then that would be a family event she is left out of.", "NTA. You don't share ages and I'm betting your wife would rather you take her daughter when you go out because she can have aline time ir meet friends", "Yta As the adult, you're entirely capable of reaching out.  Try something simple like a family movie night or a board game.", "Ugh NTA", "I agree. They should both be building this new frontier of family together for the kids' sake.", "Or her mom could suggest things they can all do to get to know each other better and have fun instead of criticizing?", "(Also, just FYI, there's nothing wrong with spending **more** time with your son than with your stepdaughter, however, there's a lot wrong with spending **lots of** time with your son and **no time** with your stepdaughter)", "The wife is objecting to him not taking her daughter with when he and his son do things. Not knowing ages it's hard to judge. Also, there's no indication his wife invites his son when she does things with her daughter", "I definitely don't disagree with that either."]}
