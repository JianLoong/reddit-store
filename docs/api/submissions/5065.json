I took the vacation time I had built up and spent an extra week there after my work obligations finished. I loved every single minute of my trip, including the business aspects. The work environment there was great and I got along well with my colleagues. I've kept in touch with quite a few of them, but one in particular, who we'll call Theo, has become one of my closest friends. He introduced me to his local friends and I was adopted into the group pretty immediately, getting taken out at night for drinks and shown the less touristy parts of the city. My wife joined me on my trip. She said she had a nice time but didn't seem to share my same enthusiasm. Towards the end of our time there, she just began staying back at the hotel while I went out and claiming she was tired.\n\nThis trip has since turned into a yearly tradition. Sometimes I'm able to pull the post business trip vacation time trick and stay two weeks, others I'm not sent by my company and only get spend a week there. Either way, it's always the highlight of my year. However, my wife seems less and less interested each time. I've asked her why, but she always brushed me off by saying she's excited and that I'm reading into things too much.\n\nOur trip this year was supposed to span from the end of December into January, and I was beyond excited to experience the NYE traditions. Despite only getting the opportunity to visit once a year, I feel like I have real roots placed there. I have close friends. Owners of restaurants I frequent when I'm there recognize me. The boss for the company branch there has told me a job is open for me whenever I finally make the decision to move since \"he knows its inevitable.\" Theo has even sent my apartment photos/listings of places we could get together when his lease is up. It just feels like my future is there.\n\nWhile talking to my wife a few nights ago, our trip came up because our flight is quickly approaching. I expressed some of the things I listed above and said it feels like a home away from home to me. What followed was my wife basically demanding that we cancel the trip. I didn't even go into much detail and played off what the boss said as mostly a joke, but she still said she couldn't believe I was ever thinking of moving so far away. I told her that that didn't change our visit, but she still wouldn't budge. I refused. The only time we've talked since then has been her asking if I've cancelled our bookings yet, and me saying no. I've told her I can cancel hers and not mine, but she said me going alone is even worse.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671399659, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zp97jp/aita_for_not_cancelling_our_annual_trip_despite/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re just taking a vacation to a place you love, and clearly wanting your wife to come, too. Adding in it\u2019s at least expected for your job. I don\u2019t get what\u2019s wrong with that. Am I missing something?\n\nEta I\u2019ve read more of your comments now, YTA. If you\u2019re contemplating a move half way around the world, your wife\u2019s opinion absolutely matters. My bad for misreading the original post.", "I don't think your wife likes being left alone/ left out every year,  especially if it's the only big trip you take? You go out with your friends,  who you nurture relationships with all year, and colleagues you work with regularly. She shows up once a year and is totally out of the loop,  no catching up because no one needs to,  so she's left out. \n\nYou spend at least twice as much time there each year than she does,  have your closest friend there,  who apparently wants to room with you when his lease is up? Are you having an emotional affair with Theo? Do you tell him things you don't also share with your wife? Do you vent to him about work and life,  but not your wife? Do you make decisions based on talking with Theo or your wife?\n\nI'd skip the trip this year,  and spend some time actually talking to your wife about how you feel.  Would you accept a position at the other location without talking to your wife.  If the answer is yes,  you need marriage counseling if you want to even try to save your marriage.\n\nETA: if you go on this trip alone,  you will be getting divorced,  and your wife will know you value your life there more than your life with her.", "I don't think it's that she prefers the spa, she would prefer not to be the third wheel in her marriage.", "Clearly you both need to work on communication but YTA for taking her on a trip she clearly doesn\u2019t like year after year and then planning to move there. S. Korea has a different culture than the U.S., it is generally a huge leap to change countries like that. Also, keep in mind that if she doesn\u2019t speak as much Korean as you or if she\u2019s a different race or gender (although I assume you\u2019re a man) than you, she might be experiencing things quite differently.", "Do you ever take her to HER dream vacation spots??", "You DID those things. What makes you think she\u2019ll want to stay with you when she knows you\u2019re chasing Theo and are still planning on moving to Seoul?", "Maybe she just doesn't want to be the third wheel on your dates.", "So you're dating someone who doesn't really like to travel and expect her to move to a completely foreign country with you? OP, you've gotta race the music: that is not going to happen and it never was.", "YTA.\n\nIf you truly love your wife and want to stay married, cancel the trip.\n\nIf you're ready to take your relationship with Theo to the next step, stop dragging your poor wife around and give her the divorce she deserves before you leave on your trip.\n\nYou're definitely having an emotional affair with Theo, and I wouldn't be surprised at all of you've already cheated on your poor wife with him.", "She gets a weekend and you get weeks of fun with your \"boyfriend\" or future roommate", "Bahaha Ohio\u2026a new AITA classic in-joke\u2026love it!", "You know there are walkable cities in the US, right?  Instead of having escapist fantasies you could try improving your life where you are.

I went back twice. I was there 2 weeks ago for 3 weeks. I met my partner a few year after living there. I always thought I wouldn\u2019t be happy being with someone who wouldn\u2019t want to move to S.Korea, Japan or Thailand with me. My partner isn\u2019t against it, we\u2019re learning Japanese. \n\nI was the person who thought she would break up to live where she wants to. This time, I went alone to S.Korea and it was fun but I didn\u2019t see why I should live my partner to live here\u2026 I like it there but it\u2019s not worth it if he\u2019s not there.\n\nYou need to think about it", "There are lots of US cities with great public transit and robust LGBTQ communities.", "You know the U.S. is a really, _really_ big place, right? There are tons of extremely walkable cities here. Which is not to say you shouldn\u2019t like Seoul more. But saying you don\u2019t like the US because the work commutes is like saying you don\u2019t like the US because of the weather. We have all the weathers, and all the commutes.", "\"It just feels like my future is there,\" isn't what I say about goals I don't plan on achieving but, that's just me. \n\nOP, surely you're not that oblivious to how this comes across. Sure, she can't tell you that you can or can't go so technically NTA for the question you asked but, I think you're severely failing to look at the bigger picture here.", "Do you really think your wife will be okay having a roommate in her marital home live with the two of you?", "You don\u2019t get to make long term, bucket list kind of goals that involve moving to an entire different countries without mentioning it to your wife.", "She\u2019s knows he\u2019s going to leave her for this place, she\u2019s making a sad attempt to stop that happening.", "Are you not worried about her CURRENTLY resenting you?", "Absolutely", "You have a guy there that you spend every moment with over there making her feel like a third wheel. And now this same guy is looking for apartments for you and he to live in together, and you wonder why your wife is weirded out by it?", "Yeah she feels like a third wheel with you and your boyfriend", "OP why do you refuse to address how your relationship with Theo is clearly inappropriate? Tons of comments about this and you keep ignoring them. That\u2019s even more fishy", "\"Since she\u2019s not speaking to my friends from there regularly during our time between visits, it can be hard to join back in immediately.\"\nYOUR friends. Not hers. She doesn't want to move to Seoul.

When you say he is sending apartment listings for you do you mean for you and your wife to live in or for you and Theo to share? And if it\u2019s the latter where does your wife fit in?", "Marinara flags galore!", "Not weird. My friends all send each other posts of apartments to move closer to each other. One friend likes to send listings of all the places we can build a commune together. I can\u2019t imagine why it would be weird to express wanting a friend to move close to you.", "Ok, I reread the post after looking at responses and I missed the moving in with your side piece part. That\u2019s definitely the main problem. Maybe YOU don\u2019t realize you guys are in a relationship but Theo does.", "Or she does like to travel, just literally not to the same place every year where OP can continue his bromance.
