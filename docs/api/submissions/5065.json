I took the vacation time I had built up and spent an extra week there after my work obligations finished. I loved every single minute of my trip, including the business aspects. The work environment there was great and I got along well with my colleagues. I've kept in touch with quite a few of them, but one in particular, who we'll call Theo, has become one of my closest friends. He introduced me to his local friends and I was adopted into the group pretty immediately, getting taken out at night for drinks and shown the less touristy parts of the city. My wife joined me on my trip. She said she had a nice time but didn't seem to share my same enthusiasm. Towards the end of our time there, she just began staying back at the hotel while I went out and claiming she was tired.\n\nThis trip has since turned into a yearly tradition. Sometimes I'm able to pull the post business trip vacation time trick and stay two weeks, others I'm not sent by my company and only get spend a week there. Either way, it's always the highlight of my year. However, my wife seems less and less interested each time. I've asked her why, but she always brushed me off by saying she's excited and that I'm reading into things too much.\n\nOur trip this year was supposed to span from the end of December into January, and I was beyond excited to experience the NYE traditions. Despite only getting the opportunity to visit once a year, I feel like I have real roots placed there. I have close friends. Owners of restaurants I frequent when I'm there recognize me. The boss for the company branch there has told me a job is open for me whenever I finally make the decision to move since \"he knows its inevitable.\" Theo has even sent my apartment photos/listings of places we could get together when his lease is up. It just feels like my future is there.\n\nWhile talking to my wife a few nights ago, our trip came up because our flight is quickly approaching. I expressed some of the things I listed above and said it feels like a home away from home to me. What followed was my wife basically demanding that we cancel the trip. I didn't even go into much detail and played off what the boss said as mostly a joke, but she still said she couldn't believe I was ever thinking of moving so far away. I told her that that didn't change our visit, but she still wouldn't budge. I refused. The only time we've talked since then has been her asking if I've cancelled our bookings yet, and me saying no. I've told her I can cancel hers and not mine, but she said me going alone is even worse.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671399659, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zp97jp/aita_for_not_cancelling_our_annual_trip_despite/", "score": 1100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The way I see this going down, a) You go on your trip and your marriage ends- idk if it will be immediate, but I'm sure your wife will pull out in some regard after learning that what she wants/needs is less important to you than this trip. b) you cancel and feel resentful which will either end in marriage counseling or your marriage ending. \n\nThis should have been addressed a long time ago, and I realize that you asked and she never answered, but as her spouse who knew something was wrong, you probably should've tried to figure this out before it inevitably ended up here. You knew she was unhappy about these annual trips, and you continued them despite knowing something was off. You're equally at fault on that one. \n\nAs far as telling her about your hair brained scheme, did you ever consider that the entire scheme is based on her unhappiness. Unhappiness that you knew about? That for her, you moving to Seoul means that you're either okay with her being unhappy, or that you're okay with ending your marriage. That's a painful realization.

But not just because you won't cancel your trip, but because you've ignored your wife for so long, you truly don't see how you've hurt her. As her spouse, you should've been more available to her, you shouldn't be entertaining moving in with a friend, even if he's only a friend, as a married person. You shouldn't be talking to your boss about your inevitable move. These aren't decisions spouses make unilaterally.

What's not okay is to continue ignoring that your wife is unhappy, and that you're keeping her that way. If you're ready to move on, then move on. But don't string this poor woman along any further. And if I'm offbase, and of course your wife is your priority, above Theo, above Seoul, THEN CANCEL THE TRIP!!!

Your wife is definitely feeling like you are planning this move without her consent, and to be honest, while you say it\u2019s joking, you are obviously already very emotionally invested in this. She has a valid reason to feel like you are planning on moving there. You need to decide if this is worth ending your marriage over or not. If not, you need to talk to your wife about how you can make her feel like you are invested in your current life, not a life in another country. That doesn\u2019t mean you can not ever visit there, but you need to take some time to regain your wife\u2019s trust.
