It's just a complete break of trust.\n\nThe dolls might have been creepy to you and ok if they were genuinely making you uncomfortable then there should have been a compromise, her refusing to have a discussion about it and saying it's her way or the high way when you said you were unhappy is stubborn and childish, but that's not an excuse to throw someone's harmless dolls away without their consent and just show a complete lack of regard for their feelings.
