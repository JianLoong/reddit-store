This day is incredibly difficult for him due to past tragedy, he is working through it on the anniversary as he does every year.  It's unfortunate that it is the same day. \n\nThink about this,  if he disrupted the wedding in any way due to his mood, you would be pissed that he was there and ruined it. \n\nUse your words.

When people ask, why not add that you miss him terribly today, but respect that he wants to reflect on this loss and be there for his mom. \n\nI would suggest you share that with him, as right now he probably doesn\u2019t think you understand his loss\u2026 everyone handles grief differently, and for him, this is his way.

For similar reasons I have paintings and photos all over my home of the sister in law I never met, who died decades before I knew my husband. \n\nLet him know that you are sad because you want to share special family memories of your family with him - I would hope that is your reason more than you don\u2019t want to explain why he\u2019s not there. Right?", "YTA 100%. Nobody should feel obligated to attend a wedding or other party for any reason - you get *invited* to one, meaning you have the option to decline, and that decision should be accepted.

You're not wrong for wanting him to go to your sister's wedding, but that date is one that is very difficult for your husband and he's not wrong to want to continue his tradition of spending time with his mother to support her, either. Also consider that being at a big joyous family event would be extra painful for him on the day he lost a big part of his own family. It would be nice if he could put it out of his mind and go to the wedding, but losing 5 family members in one fell swoop is not that easy to brush aside. I doubt he'd be able to be in the proper joyful spirit at the wedding even if he did go and I'm sure the last thing he'd want is to bring down the mood when people should be celebrating.\n\nIf people ask where he is, be honest. Tell them that your husband wishes he could've been there but this day is especially difficult for him and his mother because of the deaths on that day, and he always goes to be with her and support her on the anniversary of the tragic event. Especially make sure your sister knows exactly what happened and why his mother needs her son's support on that day. \n\nBe gentle with your husband, OP. He certainly didn't choose any of this. Ask him to come to the rehearsal dinner to support your sister and share in the joy of her wedding, and then let him be absent from the wedding with grace. It's a terrible coincidence that your sister's wedding coincides with such a painful date. It's not a deliberate snub.

You're not compromising at all: you're attempting to impose your will and priorities on his grief. You're telling him his grief doesn't matter. Stop. However, if you want to end your marriage, keep doing what you're doing. That's the road you're walking down.", "You attend the wedding.

The quotes around \u201creflecting\u201d are the first red flag here, why quotes? Do you not believe he has something to reflect about when 5 family members died? It sucks that it happens to be the same day, but a wedding can be a sensory overload and his mind will completely be with that tragedy, he will not enjoy that wedding. And if that day is for him and his mom to spend time together, you\u2019re also leaving his mother hanging. You should go to the wedding absolutely, but he is perfectly reasonable for not wanting to go, it sounds like you need to be more sensitive to his grief (it\u2019s extremely normal to still be sensitive on an anniversary years later)", "YTA.

It's not unreasonable to expect a man to be able to manage his feelings for part of the day to provide the family support to you and your sister. His SiL is (assuming here) an important part of his family, and it's growing! It's a day he gets to add back to the family he lost. I don't this that it's too much to ask that he at least be there on this one date this one year. He will likely have this date free for the rest of his life. It doesn't have to be the whole day either, so morn in the morning or something.\n\nI mention that he needs to be considered, so here goes. It would depend on the nature of the trauma. If it is extreme, then maybe the priority should be his mental stability. By extreme, I am thinking he was the first on scene to the bloody murder of his family! That's a trauma and depending on his response in previous years, a big social gathering is perhaps not a good idea. If they died in a car crash and it was just a sad day, and he spends every year on the couch in his tracksuit feeling sad, I would feel comfortable giving his some push back. Human adults experience a lot of tragic loss in their lives and all manage to push through and live. Maybe this is a push moment.\n\nAs for you and you family. there are things you can do to help. Arrange and support short term counseling so he can prepare for the day. Offer to spend some of that day with him or give him some alone time to remember his family. it would be nice if the extended family came to party too. It would be mighty supportive of them to offer a moments silence during speeches or during the ceremony. Moments silence for the members of the family that couldn't be there, wouldn't be bad and your husband would do well to honor that moment for them.\n\nEdit: I missed that part about the Mom.

If someone I was dating/married to tried to force me to go to a freaking wedding on my fiance's Death Day (as a personal example, since I am a widow and also do not do anything on that day, like OP's husband) I would honestly question if they were emotionally mature enough to respect my past and how it makes me feel. \nI also agree that making him go to a wedding is a recipe for disaster. It will completely drop the mood of the whole event. And then people will be jerks to him about it because most people really do not understand personal tragedy on that scale.\n\nAlso, I am not sure that OP understands that if everyone finds out why her spouse is having a bad time, they're not going to be nice to her about forcing him to come out on a personal day of tragedy.
