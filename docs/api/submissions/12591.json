He has a valid reason and how he grieves is completely up to him. Taking the day of the anniversary of a tragedy to mourn is a pretty normal thing that many people choose to do.

Maybe very thoughtless if she knew it was an important date to her very close sisters husband. You cannot qualify the trauma of his loss and you diminished his feelings by saying it happened years ago and he should be over it . He'll never be over it. The day is a solemn one for him that has meaning and he chooses to treat it as a day of reflection in order to make sense of a big loss.  You will always have to give him space for this day and his way of memorializing his family.", "YTA  \nIt's a dark anniversary for him. He doesn't stop thinking about it because you pulled some nonsense emotional trump card on him.

Try turning it around, would you go to the wedding if it were you losing 5 family members? Would you be able to just let it go that day and be the happy wife? \n\nYou're nta for wanting your husband to be there, but taking in mind the darkness that's involved with that day everyone at the wedding (including you) would be TA for not accepting if he can't put it up emotionally to go.", "YTA-Sounds like a very valid reason for not attending.", "YTA.

You're absolutely the selfish one.", "YTA.  You\u2019re plenty capable of explaining to people that your husband is not able to attend whatever occasion for whatever reason.

You are being selfish, and dismissive of HIS feelings. \n\nYou are stuck on the what do I tell people, and it is such an easy thing.  This day is incredibly difficult for him due to past tragedy, he is working through it on the anniversary as he does every year.  It's unfortunate that it is the same day. \n\nThink about this,  if he disrupted the wedding in any way due to his mood, you would be pissed that he was there and ruined it. \n\nUse your words. There is a very real and valid reason for you to go solo to this wedding for everyone's sake. \n\nAnd,  stop focusing on your husband. This is your sister's day. It's not about you.", "YTA", "Would depend on the tragedy but my husch is that it is major enough if it is that major even after 6 years.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the dates allign but if he needs his space you should accept it,also if you ask next year for the anniversary don't push again.\n\nMy guess YTA", "YTA.\n\nSo your husband has to care about your sister and her big day? BUT she doesn\u2019t have to care about your husband and the tragedy that struck him on that day?\n\nLike there are 365 days in a year, and if YOU MATTERED enough for your sister, she wouldn\u2019t have picked a day that she knows your husband grieves every year. \n\nYTA and leave him alone.", "YTA  \nThis also reminds me of the post earlier this week where the sister is having her wedding on the death of her stepsister and is confused as to why the other sister won't attend.\n\nAnyway, you are wrong and you are being selfish. If he normally takes that time to reflect and be alone, then let him. Just tell your family that this is a day of pain and mourning for him. But damn do you even like your husband? You even admit it was a major tragedy.", "YTA. Your discomfort over answering questions should not be weighed against his trauma. No one is going to miss him. Have fun, and when people ask, tell them the truth.", "Yta let him grieve in his own way.", "YTA\n\n If anybody asks where he is you tell them it\u00b4s a personal matter or you tell them the truth maybe?", "YTA, but it\u2019s an understandable reaction to want your husband there. He\u2019s also likely considering his mother as well. \n\nTurn this around: Would you want to be celebrating a major family event with your husband and his family on the date you and your Mom lost family - with her being home alone? When people ask, why not add that you miss him terribly today, but respect that he wants to reflect on this loss and be there for his mom. \n\nI would suggest you share that with him, as right now he probably doesn\u2019t think you understand his loss\u2026 everyone handles grief differently, and for him, this is his way. I am assuming he has decades or a lifetime of memories that are a painful reminder every time there\u2019s a holiday. For similar reasons I have paintings and photos all over my home of the sister in law I never met, who died decades before I knew my husband. \n\nLet him know that you are sad because you want to share special family memories of your family with him - I would hope that is your reason more than you don\u2019t want to explain why he\u2019s not there. Right?", "YTA 100%. Nobody should feel obligated to attend a wedding or other party for any reason - you get *invited* to one, meaning you have the option to decline, and that decision should be accepted.

YTA", "If anyone asks why he\u2019s not there, tell them the truth. I guarantee any decent human being will be understanding of his need to grieve.", "Gentle YTA. You're not wrong for wanting him to go to your sister's wedding, but that date is one that is very difficult for your husband and he's not wrong to want to continue his tradition of spending time with his mother to support her, either. Also consider that being at a big joyous family event would be extra painful for him on the day he lost a big part of his own family. It would be nice if he could put it out of his mind and go to the wedding, but losing 5 family members in one fell swoop is not that easy to brush aside. I doubt he'd be able to be in the proper joyful spirit at the wedding even if he did go and I'm sure the last thing he'd want is to bring down the mood when people should be celebrating.\n\nIf people ask where he is, be honest. Tell them that your husband wishes he could've been there but this day is especially difficult for him and his mother because of the deaths on that day, and he always goes to be with her and support her on the anniversary of the tragic event. Especially make sure your sister knows exactly what happened and why his mother needs her son's support on that day. \n\nBe gentle with your husband, OP. He certainly didn't choose any of this. Ask him to come to the rehearsal dinner to support your sister and share in the joy of her wedding, and then let him be absent from the wedding with grace. It's a terrible coincidence that your sister's wedding coincides with such a painful date. It's not a deliberate snub. Once people hear the explanation, they will understand, and anyone who's offended is very insensitive and should do better.", "YTA-You are being incredibly selfish not him. It reads like you want him there because people are going to ask why he\u2019s not there. If they care about him at all they\u2019ll understand that he couldn\u2019t attend.", "The horror!

You're not compromising at all: you're attempting to impose your will and priorities on his grief. You're telling him his grief doesn't matter. Stop. However, if you want to end your marriage, keep doing what you're doing. That's the road you're walking down.", "You attend the wedding.

The quotes around \u201creflecting\u201d are the first red flag here, why quotes? Do you not believe he has something to reflect about when 5 family members died? It sucks that it happens to be the same day, but a wedding can be a sensory overload and his mind will completely be with that tragedy, he will not enjoy that wedding. And if that day is for him and his mom to spend time together, you\u2019re also leaving his mother hanging. You should go to the wedding absolutely, but he is perfectly reasonable for not wanting to go, it sounds like you need to be more sensitive to his grief (it\u2019s extremely normal to still be sensitive on an anniversary years later)", "YTA.

No one can tell him when he isn\u2019t allowed to grief anymore.", "Maybe having one day a year set aside to grieve is how he does manage to deal with the triggers in the rest of his day-to-day life. He knows the date, it's not like he's going to be able to forget and have a great time if he's thinking about how a number of family members died tragically. I don't think it's reasonable to have strict rules about how people ought to grieve - taking one day a year to grieve with his mum seems appropriate in the circumstances.", "Maybe it\u2019s me but I don\u2019t agree with this . My dad died two weeks before his 50th birthday. Each year my sister and I take two days to do something to commemorate him . One being the anniversary of his death and two being his birthday . I was 19 when he died and I\u2019m 29 now . I\u2019ve come along way since then and my life is in no way hindered by his passing although it hasn\u2019t always been easy but i do think about him and like to take those two particular days to do so in his honour .", "Wow... 5 family members died in one event and he spends the anniversary of their deaths supporting his mother, and your conclusion is that he probably *enjoys* it? I have no words.", "This is the thing, I don't mind if he attends only the ceremony and skips the reception, or attends the reception and skips the ceremony. He can have the rest of the day to himself if he wants. I'm willing to compromise, he's not at all.", "The tragedy was that he lost 5 family members.", "5 family members died in one day.  I can't imagine any amount of therapy that would help him deal with that. The anniversary will sit with him for many years to come.", ">Looks like someone's more excited to show off her husband than actually marrying him.\n\nAnd of course, at any wedding, people are much more interested in members of the bridal party than in the people actually getting married. I'm sure folks will forget the bride and groom and spend the entire evening peppering OP with questions.", "I hadn't seen that he lost 5 people,  that is more than enough reason for him to spend that day reflecting. \n\nIt really makes op's 'get over it' comment all the more awful.", "Did you see OP's quotation marks around tragedy date and reflecting as if mocking her husband's grief. \n\nSeriously, he lost 5 family members and she is pushing him to attend a celebratory event. \n\nI would not be surprised seeing OP's attitude if OP & OP's sister deliberatory set the date on the tragedy day. She seems so unsympathetic of his feelings. \n\nOP is such a huge A-hole.", "Yep. Then definitely YTA", "It shouldn\u2019t matter what the tragedy is.  One persons tragedy is another persons day in the park.  The mere fact that whatever the tragedy was makes Ford feel some kind of way on that specific anniversary is the point.   Forcing Ford on that day, or anyone who has their day of remembrance for whatever reason, to do something they don\u2019t want to do is the issue.  The tragedy is not needed information.", "So true", "I mean it in that if it truly is something thats not a big deal, He should go and celebrate with the family at a family event. Obviously something happened and it\u2019s more than just something small though which is why I phrased it the way that I did. Because it sounds like the reason is a big one. But barring big reasons or interpersonal conflict with her family, he should probably go to the family event", "Yeah she edited it. Thanks", "So yeah, YTA... If you respect his feelings, and understand them, you would respect that going to a celebration where being sad and emotionally checked out would be considered rude and inappropriate sounds miserable.\n\nIt's unfortunate, and I understand wanting your husband at a wedding, but... He's trying to take care of himself, AND is getting respectful of what being a guest at a wedding requires.  Explain to your sister, and just tell everyone else he isn't feeling well, and celebrate with your family.", "It\u2019s unfortunate that the dates coincide. You asked him to go, he said no and YWBTA if you continue to pester him about it.", "Why can\u2019t you make your sister compromise and have her not pick a day that your husband had more than 2 dead relatives?\n\nHe is freaking grieving still and that day is TRAUMATIC. You sister is important to you, but isn\u2019t the man you married important to you?", "It\u2019s not a matter of compromise. He is HURTING and you\u2019re disregarding that over a day where you will barely see him due to your MOH responsibilities.", "Actually you\u2019re not compromising. You\u2019re just outright dismissing the importance of this day in your husband\u2019s life. You don\u2019t need your husband\u2019s support to attend your sister\u2019s wedding. He needs your support to understand his perspective & recognize he has his own feelings about this day & participating in a wedding would not be in any way fun for him. Your sister\u2019s wedding is not the most important thing for him on that day, why would anyone force him to sit through that?", "I see I am in the minority of people who think you're NTA, but I am prepared to die on this hill.\n\nThis isn't like some distant relative or friend's wedding - it's your sister, you are the MOH, and he is your husband. He and your sister are now family. His absence will be noted, especially given that you haven't been married all that long. I get that it's a sad day for him etc etc, but any therapist will tell you it is totally unreasonable (and frankly unhealthy) to block off an entire day each year to wallow in grief at the expense of fulfilling the requirements of life.\n\nHe should at least be able to compromise with you - put on a brave face for the wedding, duck out of the reception. Or he could decide to reflect the day before, or the day after. You're not telling him he can never have his reflection time again - just that he has to break his usual routine for one year.\n\nI'm sorry, I know it'll sound harsh to all the people who are like \" leave him alone and let him grieve\", but it seems to me that he has given his emotional response to a seven year old tragedy priority over the feelings of his wife, and I think that is neither a healthy pattern of behaviour to get into, nor a compassionate way to be in a relationship.", "I disagree in a sense. I don\u2019t think he will ever get over it and I don\u2019t think he should have to get over something so horrific that happened. But I think it\u2019s bad for his mental well being to stew on it. \n\nFrom my own personal experiences with death I like to focus on the good, as hard as it is. And I would like to clarify I don\u2019t think he\u2019s TA either in this situation. It\u2019s a difficult situation to navigate and there\u2019s no right or wrong to grieving.", "Oh yeah, I totally agree! It's just that on this sub, whenever an OP doesn't specify something like that, they're quite often burying the lede on purpose because they know it won't reflect well on them. Ford would be well within his rights to not go if it *was* the anniversary of his dog's death, but given AITA's track record, I'm fully expecting OP to casually drop a comment along the lines of 'It's only the anniversary of the day his sister's wedding venue burned down, killing his entire family! Why is he still so sensitive about it!' haha.\n\nEDIT: There it is. Whatever it was, he apparently lost five family members on that day.", "See, here's the thing - what if Ford and OP have a baby, and the baby's birthday is on this date? What if they have a major milestone on this date? Is Ford just going to refuse to celebrate and ignore everything else on this day?\n\nHe and his family went through something very tragic, yes. He can pay his respects, while realizing the world moves on. He seems to still be stuck on 7 years ago.\n\nOP commented it's okay if he only attends the ceremony or reception, and skips the other. Ford is the one completely unwilling to compromise anything.\n\nFord is the one who called OP selfish first. It isn't selfish to want your own husband to attend your sister's wedding with you. It's called supporting your partner, realizing that you can both attend and celebrate something and understand something tragic happened on the day. \n\nSay OP's pregnant and goes into labor on this date. Ford doesn't come to the birth though because he doesn't want to, and you can't \"force him on his day of remembrance\".  That's okay then right?", "I can see your point, but can't come to agree with it. I am introverted and skip many event just because I don't feel like it, but at the same time, I would never mind if someone doesn't want to show up for my events. I think this is a very subjective topic with very personal wants/needs. It's sound a bit strange to me how people can say that you should be somewhere where you don't want to be. Time is precious, don't spend it on things you don't enjoy. No hate, just my opinion as you have yours and probably don't fully understand it from my point of view :)", "Yeah.  FIVE. Whatever that tragedy was, op thinks Ford is the one being selfish.  SMH.", "OP is not pregnant, they don't have a kid so this doesn't matter. Wanting to use ONE day where FIVE family members died and want to spend with people who understand this loss doesn't mean he is \"stuck\" sevem years A\nago.", "I'll reply to your whataboutism with what if Ford had a sister and she suddenly and tragically died on her wedding day? That seems like a pretty big family tragedy that would make me not want to attend a wedding where a sister was getting married.   \n\n\nAnd add to the fact that OP states that there - five - of them. Leave Ford alone.", "I totally get that. Im quick to say I\u2019m not going places. But I\u2019m more of the belief that close family events, I am *more likely* to attend. Lol", "I can respect that"]}
