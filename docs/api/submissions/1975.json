I was getting bullied for a while now by this girl my age (A) and my best friends mom (C) works at our school. My school has a morning routine where everyone goes to the cafeteria until 9:35 (school lets people in at 9:15) but instead of going there, I go to my best friends moms classroom. So on Tuesday, \"A\" got her friends to insult me as I was walking to school (they stand on the sidewalk that i need to walk on) and that was kind of my breaking point. I show up to my friends moms classroom and just start sobbing and \"C\" knew my bully personally as she was an old student of hers. So she talked to her and was getting her to apologize to me the next day. My mom knew about the bullying but I told her to let \"C\" handle it since it wouldnt cause as much drama as going to the principal would. \"A\" was mean to me but I still didnt want her to get a referral or something if she realized what she did was wrong. So my mom on Wednesday morning goes to drop me off by the crosswalk and she sees my bully standing there waiting for me so she could apologize. Instead of dropping me off, my mom starts to scream at her from the car, telling her if she wants to insult other people than look in the mirror and just very hurtful stuff. I leave my car as soon as I could have and \"A\" still said sorry to me and she looked truly sincere. But 30 people witnessed my mom going off on that girl and I didnt want her to do that, it caused more issues. I go to my friends moms room (where the friend always is in case that wasnt clear) and I just start crying because i felt humiliated. I called my mom crying and upset and then hung up on her. (My phone got taken Wednesday evening because of this)Then my friends mom talks to my bully and makes sure my mom isnt in trouble, and then later when i wasnt in the room she called my mom and told her you cant just yell at a child like that and everything was going to be fixed before she did that. My day was ruined after the whole scene and when my mom picked me up from school I let all my anger out and just said some things i wish i could take back. My mother is an immigrant and she told me a while ago that when she got picked on as a kid her mom would go to the school and yell at whoever was making fun of her. I used that against her and said maybe you do that there but we dont do that here(We live in America). And I also said things like \"if you did that because you care then why didnt you care when i was begging you to stop?\" I know now that she had good intentions but in the moment i was just upset. Now, thursday morning, she told me that because i was \"talking behind her back\" to my friends mom even though i only said what my mom said to my bully, im not allowed to go to her classroom in the morning. Im not sure if i should apologize for what i said yesterday.

I don't know the whole story, but I'm guessing that it's awful for your mother to know that someone is bullying you and that she holds a lot of anger towards A, since she's the one hurting you. If your mother has bullied herself and her mother solved it by yelling at whoever was mean toward her, it's not too odd that she went with that action herself, even though it's generally not ok to yell at children (alternatively, if she's angry at A, when saw her, she might not have been able to fully control herself and yelled despite knowing it's not the most appropriate action).", "NTA\n\nBut try not to hold it against your mom, she probably was worried and was triggered by her own experiences.\n\nTalk with her and make sure she understands that it wasn't okay to yell at another kid. And that in trying to protect you she essentially bullied another kid.", "Soft YTA , you're quite young so it's understandable that you dont  express your emotions in the most appropriate way , but you said it yourself , you said hurtful things that you shouldn't have said and now the least you could do is apologies to your mom . What made me say YTA is that you wrote that you didn't have remorse in the title which you should. Now her reaction definitely wasn't the best either but since your friend's mom told her about it I don't think there's any need to keep being mad at her .", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
