Someone is literally physically abusing his wife and he keeps hanging out with them? \n\nI'd be filling for divorce if it was me.", "NAH. You set your boundary. You have every right to not have a relationship with them. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to ban your husband from seeing his parents. I think the assholes here are the parents, and you are right to not have them in your life.", "Lol wtf", "NTA!\nYour husband is though!  \n\nEvery time he watches his parents assault and verbally abuse you and doesn\u2019t say or do anything, he is letting them know it\u2019s ok.   \n\nEvery time he visits them without holding them accountable, he is letting them know it\u2019s ok. \n\nHe is accepting of their behavior because he doesn\u2019t think it is wrong. \n\nPlease be careful x", "Who the fuck let\u2019s someone pull their spouses hair? \n\nNTA.", "If you insist on remaining married to this mess, please don\u2019t have any children with this man.", "So if your father slapped your partner, you'd be okay being around him?", "Call 911 then.", "Where does it say she was slapped? He\u2019s been irritating and inappropriate with the poking and prodding, and clumsy with his feet, but not seriously violent.", "Do not have kids with him. You will never be able to control his parents not being around your kids, and you would be contributing to their inevitable abuse. He will allow them to see your children married and even more divorced- you\u2019ll have no say. Think long and hard. They\u2019ve shown you who they are. It\u2019s up to you to decide if this is the lifestyle you want for yourself and any potential children."]}
