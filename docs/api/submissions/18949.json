I dont want to be responsible for them and 2. I dont think my cousin deserves to be catered to by me. We are not close at all and John and his girlfriend have done some terrible things to my grandfather and other family members. I'm not interested in rewarding this with a free ride.\n\nI might be the asshole here because my aunt, mom and grandfather (who all have cars btw) have repeatedly begged me to drive for John since they all want him there. I kept saying no, but they kept asking and so I just have been ghosting them. The wedding is coming up and I'm worried if I dont  drive, John won't have a ride and everyone will be pissed at me. I've already decided I'm not going to drive, I need to be able to leave the wedding at any time in case my partner (m25) starts feeling uncomfortable as though my immediate family knows about our relationship, there are conservative politicians in my extended family. \n\n\nTLDR; my cousin needs a ride to a family wedding and I'm refusing because I dont want my partner to feel trapped in a potentially homophobic environment AND because he has done some awful things I dont want to reward. \n\nWIBTA?", "created_utc": 1685886693, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/140dpu7/wibta_for_refusing_to_drive_my_cousin_to_my/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let somebody who actually wants John there drive him. How about his parents? I appreciate your need for flexibility in your reception exit time. Don't risk losing it and turning your experience into a nightmare. Explain to family that Uber and Lyft still exist.", "NTA. I've never understood why people think younger family members are at their beck and call, and can be told instead of being asked.\n\nI recommend something like \"I've already said I won't be available, so please make another plan\" - on repeat - because they're just trying to wear you down.", "NTA. You've said no, so don't drive him.  You don't even have to have a reason.\n\nYou might contact some of those other relatives and just say \"as you know, I won't be driving cousin. I hope you've made alternate arrangements.\"  Then no one can say they had no idea you weren't driving the cousin.\n\nWhatever you do, I urge you to NOT give in on this issue.", "NTA. It\u2019s your car, your prerogative. You\u2019re not obligated to chauffeur your adult cousin around. You\u2019ve told your family repeatedly \u201cno\u201d so they should respect that. Maybe be more direct with them instead of ghosting and just say, \u201c I\u2019m still upset over what they did to grandma, I want to leave whenever I feel ready to do so, and the drive is too far out of my way. If you\u2019re open to a compromise (I don\u2019t believe you need to be) then maybe agree to p/u your cousin but not responsible for bringing him home. If you\u2019re looking for a reason not to feel bad if he can\u2019t show up then you shouldn\u2019t need to. He\u2019s an adult, we have ride sharing apps, it\u2019s not your responsibility. I lost my license for a period of time around his age and managed to get myself around as well as to and from events. He\u2019s capable of doing the same.

They will make sure he arrives without your help. NO is a one word sentence. Don't allow them to bully you into this uncomfortable situation.", "NTA - it\u2019s your car. Your rules. You\u2019re not responsible for adults. It doesn\u2019t sound like John has asked your or justified to you why he can\u2019t find a ride himself. Which when you would basically be doing him a favor is just unacceptable imo.", "INFO: Can't someone else drive them? Can't they drive themselves?", "Absolutely NTA. A viable escape plan is a must. Someone who cares that John is there can drive him.\n\nNo, is a complete sentence", "I was leaning toward you being the A until I read about the likelihood of facing homophobia. Definitely NTA! It would be nice if you could say something like, \"Sure, just disinvite the homophobes and it'll be no problem,\" but I get that that's not a reasonable option. One of the relatives who wants to see your cousin can be responsible for him.", "NTA\nbut if possible, can you go there without your car? go with your partner car or uber maybe?so that they won't ambuse you to take them home after the party, if they did attend the party", "NTA but consider saying, \"If john needs a ride there he can ask!\" It sounds like john wont ask. Also... be specific: \"*to* the wedding\" \"ride *there*\" Dont emphasize that youre only committing one-way so you dont get haggled. But you're NOT trapped sweet sweet OP or sweet sweet OP partner. Irish goodbye as quick as you want!! John will find a ride home. Promise. \n\nSidenote create a scoring system for acceptable microaggressions and red card ejections with your partner. My bf and i did this and it was really helpful for not feeling like i was being too sensitive. Our score maxed at 10. Comments about where we lived and any \"statistics\"- 1pt, initiating conversations about any community outside of ours-1pt if quick drop, 3pt if painful, comments about implementing trad roles-1-3pts depending on severity, any comment that even insinuated sexual nature towards me-6 pts, nuclear immediate silent exit for previously expressed boundary violation.", "Info: why on earth you are planning to go to said event in the first place?", "NTA.  You have several valid reasons for not doing it.  If John and GF really want to be there, they will figure something else out.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is 1,5 hours. If it s that important to THEM, THEY can pick him up. Or pay for a car to drive him.", "NTA. Even if you didn't have a reason beyond just not wanting to. You are not a taxi service. They can Uber.\n\nBe firm in your decision and let people know ahead of time.\n\nI'd say you would BTA if you say you are going to and bail last minute because you cannot say no.", "Eh kind of an asshole tbh, but technically you have every right to refuse to drive him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
