Both of us are (slightly) overweight, though since around September 2022 I've been making a lot of lifestyle changes and have lost a significant amount of the weight. Eva is also doing her best to lose weight; it was something we planned on doing together, I've been trying to get her to go to the gym with me, or go on walks but she always tells me she either doesn't have time or is with her boyfriend that day. Instead her little brother (16M) has been going with me. I'm really proud of him as he struggled with a lot of the same issues that come with being overweight. \n\nEva has been posting about her \"fit girl lifestyle\" on her social media for a while now, which would be totally awesome if she wasn't going through the McDonald's driveway with her boyfriend almost every day and her brother hadn't flat out told me she fakes most of the posts. I've never commented on it before and I really wasn't planning to, it's her life and she's allowed to do whatever she wants. \n\nLast Saturday we decided to have a family dinner, everything was all fine until Eva made a comment on how much i was eating. Something along the lines of \"Jesus no wonder you've lost so much weight if that's all you're eating\" I ate a very normal portion of food (potatoes, some veggies and salmon). During the dinner she kept making small comments on both me and her brother and how we were eating to little, working out too much and how we would probably develop eating disorders. I got pretty mad after a while and said \"well maybe if you stopped eating all those McChicken burgers and actually joined us for once you would feel less insecure, then you'd have real content to post on your socials\" (something along those lines). The table fell kinda silent and Eva started crying saying she was \"doing all she could\" and \"your and brothers weightloss is so triggering for me\". She decided to go to her room and her boyfriend said i'd been too harsh on her. Eva did not come back to the table and everyone was pretty quiet after. \n\nAfter we got home my aunt texted that I should apologize to Eva for being mean, I told her I would apologize if she would as well, to both me and her little brother for the comments she made as they hurt me as well. Eva doesn't want to and won't talk to me as long as I won't apologize. Her brother and my mom are on my side but aunt & uncle are mad that I won't do it.\n\nAITA?\n\nLittle edit: I've posted this a very short while ago but I'll let you all know I'll be sending her a text. She hurt my feelings and I've hurt hers as well. It was all very in the moment as this has been going on for a while (for months everytime we hang out there's been at least one comment) I don't wish to fight with her and I'll be letting her know that I was too harsh as I was very fed up with the BS, I'll be telling her I'm sorry but I won't go begging for an apology from her. I'll be taking the high road here, thanks to all here for making me see that :)", "created_utc": 1684239995, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13j3rwf/aita_for_calling_my_niece_out_on_her_fit_girl/", "score": 183, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You and her bro have worked really hard and she feels like its a slight against her or your mere presence being thinner is triggering. You absolutely should not apologise, in fact she should for trying to guilt trip you", "NTA. She started it and you told her the truth in her face, it's time for her to actually change her lifestyle and stop faking and lying herself (who cares for social medias anyway) she's only lying to herself. Also you said she's your niece but her mother is your aunt? How?", "NTA. She\u2019s got to put in actual work if she wants to see results, not just lie about what she eats and does.", "ESH.  \n\n\nBody images and food ought to be considered less a topic of conversation than religion and money.   Neither of you are supportive of the other.  Leave each other alone.", "Esh smh this is some 16 yo behavior", "ESH. She\u2019s not doing all she can to get fit and she knows it. Making snide comments to you is her way of defending against her imagined judgement of her by you. It was childish. \n\nYour response was crafted to intentionally hurt her back. Also childish.", "ESH An apology should not be conditional. You were out of line making that comment. She also shouldn\u2019t have made those comments. You can only control what you do and what you did was appalling. Further, you\u2019re dividing the family over it.", "ESH.\n\nBad, immature reactions all around.\n\nIF you want to be the bigger person, apologize, then go live your best fit life.", "NTA you have nothing to apologize for you were only telling the truth she on the other hand was making wild comments to you and her brother accusing you of possibly getting an eating disorder but you have to apologize cuz doing things that make you healthy trigger her. F than im so tired of people using the excuse i'm triggered so i can't be respectful polite and keep my mouth shut but God forbid you say anything to her. live your life i know you used to be best friends but i dont see it lasting if you continue to get healthy while she doesn't", "ESH. Eva is completely in the wrong, but you replied hurtfully and on the offensive instead of simply shutting down her BS.", "I agree with Dr. Pepper. Someone's gotta make the first move or else this could destroy your relationship over something petty. You could have handled it better, but it sounds like she's jealous and doesn't want to put in the effort to achieve the same results. Just giving some advice from personal experience. My cousin and I were the same way. Super close as kids. Almost sisters. I was the one who said something stupid, and she also took it super personal and took it the wrong way from what I meant. It's been over 5 years since we've spoken despite the fact I've apologized for whatever I said and no longer remember what we were arguing about. If you guys are as close as you think, don't let this get in the way of your friendship.", "ESH - granted she started the comments, but you could have stopped her by simply saying \u201cEva, can you please stop watching and commenting on my eating? I\u2019m trying really hard not to get upset by them.\u201d \n\nInstead of taking the high road, you met her head on, and as is usual, beat the attacker at her own game, which then sends the attacker cowering. Congrats, you won \ud83d\ude44 at this child\u2019s game. But now, you have to put on your adult hat. You responded in a way that makes you both wrong instead of in a way that just makes Eva wrong.  You both owe each other an apology. The one who actually will get the \u201crisen above it\u201d credit will be the one who apologizes first. \n\nAnd round 2 of this child\u2019s game starts. \u201cI will if she will\u2026\u201d\n\nYou need to correct both of your ages. Pick something under 13, please.", "ESH. You both need some perspective on what\u2019s important in life. Body image and weight issues are generally not on the list of reasons we refuse to be civil with people we love. \n\nHer comments and remarks were unnecessary and probably uncomfortable, yes. But you took it a little too far. Definitely apologize for that. You should explain to her how her comments hurt as well and you\u2019ve tried being supportive but you can\u2019t force someone to do something they don\u2019t want to. \n\nYou both need to support and accept the decisions y\u2019all each make for your futures. She needs to be happy for you and support you. You still need to encourage her, even if she\u2019s pretending. The fact that she\u2019s pretending means she at least knows she needs to start somewhere. \n\nTalk it out.", "I'm going to say NTA, BUT..... you should've handled it better. Your reaction isn't surprising, but sometimes as we get older we learn the value of being the better person. \n\nI would like to offer one piece of advice. I think you should apologize first. Not because you are in the wrong, but because someone has to be the better person. If you don't this could drag out for longer than you think", "ESH.\n\nShould she have been making comments?  No.  Should you have gone from silent stewing to retaliatory nukes?  No.\n\nBy insulting her right back, you validate her own insults.  You tell her 'insults are a valid way to communicate; you're allowed to do it, I'm allowed to do it, and the only question is, who's more willing to escalate?'\n\nNext time, try something like \"Hey, could you stop making comments about my body, what I'm eating, and my activities?
