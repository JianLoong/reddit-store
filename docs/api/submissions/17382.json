Both of us are (slightly) overweight, though since around September 2022 I've been making a lot of lifestyle changes and have lost a significant amount of the weight. Eva is also doing her best to lose weight; it was something we planned on doing together, I've been trying to get her to go to the gym with me, or go on walks but she always tells me she either doesn't have time or is with her boyfriend that day. Instead her little brother (16M) has been going with me. I'm really proud of him as he struggled with a lot of the same issues that come with being overweight. \n\nEva has been posting about her \"fit girl lifestyle\" on her social media for a while now, which would be totally awesome if she wasn't going through the McDonald's driveway with her boyfriend almost every day and her brother hadn't flat out told me she fakes most of the posts. I've never commented on it before and I really wasn't planning to, it's her life and she's allowed to do whatever she wants. \n\nLast Saturday we decided to have a family dinner, everything was all fine until Eva made a comment on how much i was eating. Something along the lines of \"Jesus no wonder you've lost so much weight if that's all you're eating\" I ate a very normal portion of food (potatoes, some veggies and salmon). During the dinner she kept making small comments on both me and her brother and how we were eating to little, working out too much and how we would probably develop eating disorders. I got pretty mad after a while and said \"well maybe if you stopped eating all those McChicken burgers and actually joined us for once you would feel less insecure, then you'd have real content to post on your socials\" (something along those lines). The table fell kinda silent and Eva started crying saying she was \"doing all she could\" and \"your and brothers weightloss is so triggering for me\". She decided to go to her room and her boyfriend said i'd been too harsh on her. Eva did not come back to the table and everyone was pretty quiet after. \n\nAfter we got home my aunt texted that I should apologize to Eva for being mean, I told her I would apologize if she would as well, to both me and her little brother for the comments she made as they hurt me as well. Eva doesn't want to and won't talk to me as long as I won't apologize. Her brother and my mom are on my side but aunt & uncle are mad that I won't do it.\n\nAITA?\n\nLittle edit: I've posted this a very short while ago but I'll let you all know I'll be sending her a text. She hurt my feelings and I've hurt hers as well. It was all very in the moment as this has been going on for a while (for months everytime we hang out there's been at least one comment) I don't wish to fight with her and I'll be letting her know that I was too harsh as I was very fed up with the BS, I'll be telling her I'm sorry but I won't go begging for an apology from her. I'll be taking the high road here, thanks to all here for making me see that :)\n\nEdit 2: I'll let you all know she responded to my text and she also said she was sorry, i wasn't really expecting her to but she did. We planned a luch + shopping trip and will be talking it out more then!

Every weekend we'd pick a class in class pass and all go together for 2 years.  She always backed out last minute (never once came to a workout) ,  but would show up to the brunch and order tons of food. The lying is a side effect of binge eating disorders. Your cousin likely has massive amounts of shame about her inability to control her weight,  and the only thing she can do to protect her mental health is be in denial. It's likely your cousin believes in her fit lifestyle to some degree because she is also trying to convince herself. Your cousin likely needs to seek therapy ans recieve coaching on lifestyle changes.  You saying anything to her likely won't help,  especially if your success is a trigger for her.  I now listen to my friend complain about her weight and sympathize with her.  I no longer offer suggestions or advice because I know that it is not helping her.  More than anything,  I want her to feel safe with me so that when she's at a point where she can mentally change her relationship with food & exercise,  I will be there for her. I do the same thing with a severely anorexic friend.  I'm there to support. That's it.  They're aware of their issues and I have no control over how they handle them.

People making fat comments know they are being assholes but get a pass from a lot of people for \"skinny\" comments. Not that it should matter but many thinner people also struggle with their weight. Often its due to health issues. Even if its not, nobody likes being repeatedly told they should eat more when they dont want to or are physically unable. I had a period where I was on a liquid diet because I could not swallow properly (its gotten but better but still struggle with a lot of foods). The skinny comments started biting more than usual because I wanted nothing more than to eat a burger and literally couldn't.

People can know their \u201ctriggers\u201d without constantly telling others what they are - and in fact they SHOULD keep that information private because their mental health is not the responsibility of anyone else.  I get awfully tired of hearing the word \u201ctriggered\u201c/\u201ctriggers\u201d because I legitimately DO NOT CARE.  I\u2019m not going to police myself for every single thing which could possibly bother another person, and that\u2019s actually what \u201ctriggered\u201d really means for most people.  Thus why people think that it is massively overused.", "The opinion you're expressing addresses something completely orthogonal to what I said in my comment.\n\nNo one's saying you have to care. No one's saying you aren't tired of hearing the word \"triggered\". No one's asking you to police yourself. You're completely welcome to have a boundary and stay on your side of it. And, tbh, limit your speculation of what things actually mean for most people, unless you can back that up with citations.\n\nYour response seems a bit disproportionate to what I said, which is similar to how folks struggling to manage/recognize their trauma typically react to their triggers. To be clear: I'm not saying you're triggered, as that's not my call to make, but there's a lot more feeling there than anything about *should* vs *is*. And that's all about you and your responsibility to manage those feelings.", "NTA    Why do people feel it\u2019s ok to make comments about portion sizes.", "I think it's more of an ESh tbh, sure she started it but imo OP kinda escalated it, completely out of proportion. It's like bringing a gun to a knife fight lmao", "I know a few fat people who are in total denial about their weight", "I've said before, but I'll say again. Eating disorders and addiction heavily overlap when it comes to the way the brain works. However, eating disorders are unique in that you absolutely must face your trigger head on, daily, to live. You can never set foot in a bar, never be around someone smoking crack again in your life, but you will need to eat every day. It's why I was turned away from multiple clinics when I was seeking treatment. Eating disorders require a different approach.\n\nAll that to say, triggers are still your own responsibility. I appreciate people being sensitive to me by not talking about the exact diet their on, calorie deficits, or pounds lost. But, those are only the people who know my struggles. I have to navigate a world that loves diet culture, ads for gyms, and amazing weight loss pills (50 lbs in 2 months!!)."]}
