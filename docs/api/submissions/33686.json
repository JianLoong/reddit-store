It is often very helpful and healing for the family to gather, celebrate your life and spend time together comforting one another. \n\nAs you grow older, your family will grow and likely spread out to different places. Funerals bring people back together. Its pretty hard hearted to decide they have to go against your wishes if your family wants to be together\nIf you live to a ripe old age and have a good life, call it a \u201cCelebration of Life \u201c.  But if death is sudden, unexpected and tragic, your loved ones will need to be together and try to help each other through the shock and grief even more so.\n\nWhen my Dad died at nearly 87 years old, we had a wonderful life celebration with over 50 family members from 14 states and scores of friends and colleagues. It was a joyful time tinged with sadness.\n\nIt was the best thing in the world for my Mom. It really helped get through that first year which is always the hardest.\n\nWhen my daughter died suddenly and unexpectedly, I don\u2019t think I would have survived without the farewell service and all the support that poured in. \n\nFunerals are only a waste of money if you don\u2019t care about the people who will be sad and grieving when you die. It\u2019s worth it to them.\n\nMost of our family members who have passed chose to be cremated and so there was very modest expense of less than $3,000 for my Dad last year. My parents are not wealthy but over the years they had saved sufficiently to more than pay for all the expenses.\n\nDon\u2019t think about yourself, think about people who love you.", "NAH  \nI get it - and agree - funerals are expensive. Another perspective though, is that the celebration is not \"for\" you - it's \"about\" you - but it's for other reasons - to say goodbye, to help that grief process and so on.  So while I totally get it - it's not your money you're saving, but it is that opportunity you're also removing at the same time. Perspective 3 - yu can't stop them doing something if they want to.  So - is there something that serves that purpose that you would be open to, that might also be agreeable for your husband?  \nPS - I think it's great you are talking about these things now, before it becomes and urgent need to decide.", "NAH  I think maybe you and your husband are kind of talking about two different things. You were thinking about the expensive funeral home part of it, and he\u2019s thinking about the human celebration of life part of it. Does that sound right?\nYou can specify a no frills cremation or natural funeral. But what about the non money part? Like a potluck where everyone reminisces about you and toasts your life?  Would that be okay since it doesn\u2019t cost anything?\n\nEdit to change judgement to nah", "NAH. You have a right to not want a funeral, and your husband has a right to disagree. So long as he can respect your wishes, it\u2019s ok to not to see eye-to-eye. \n\nMaybe request that the time/money for a funeral be donated to an organization you care about instead as a way to honor you? But if you don\u2019t want that either that\u2019s your right!\n\nSo sorry for your losses this year, OP.", "YTA funerals are for the living, not the dead. It is a way to find closure and peace with the passing of a loved one. It's understandable that it upsets your husband. The funeral is about you, but it's not for you. Also, you'll be dead so it shouldn't matter anyways.", "I mean does it really matter though?  You\u2019re dead.  To me it\u2019s wasted energy to fight over this.", "NAH. I don\u2019t want a funeral either. But I want a party. I don\u2019t care what they do to my body but donated to science / forensic body farm / cremated and mixed with road salt (it\u2019s icy out there, let\u2019s throw down some RCKJD) / cremated would be my preferred choice over embalmed and entombed. \n\nAs for the party, I want it to start with a minute of silent reflection which will be then interrupted by \u201cHighway to Hell\u201d by AC/DC. Just the thought of people solemnly quiet, the intro and their realization what is happening would be worth it. Then the party to celebrate my likes. Cheeseburger, pizza, coke, \u201cThe Rocky Horror Picture Show\u201d on a TV. \n\nWhat I mean is, talk to your husband how you would want to be remembered. Denying anything seems a bit passive-aggressive \u201coh, just toss my body in the trash, nobody cares anyway.\u201d (I know this was most likely not your intention, but it might appear that way).", "Both my parents died and we did private cremations.. I\u2019ve been to funerals that turn into circuses and the grieving family has to pay for the restaurant? Then a burial? All the extras? \n\nOurs were private and no fuss. It\u2019s a death not a wedding.", "NTA\n\nMy dad requested the same.  He compromised to allow 1 day in a funeral home (after cremation) when my mom pointed out that people would be stopping by for weeks or months if there wasn't a set \"event\".\n\nIt was truly the most restful, non-stressful time it could have possibly been.\n\nI've requested a good Irish wake without the corpse.  Might as well leave my friends with a good hangover!  Lol", "NTA\u2014loved ones can gather and mourn without spending a lot of money, certainly.  I personally don\u2019t even want a memorial of any sort.  And members of my family would rather have my money than spend it on a funeral.", "NTA. How you are buried, etc truly doesn\u2019t matter in the end. If you\u2019re worried about expense, that should be respected. I\u2019d say compromise on the \u201ccelebration of life\u201d and say \u201cjust have a pizza party and talk about how awesome I am\u201d to kind of break the ice but also respect that those who are \u2018left behind\u2019 have an opportunity to remember you together.", "NTA. My grandpa didn\u2019t want a funeral. No calling hours. Nothing. We were there when his ashes were buried, which he wouldn\u2019t have particularly wanted, but we did. He felt that funerals were a waste of money and anyone that wants to see him could do so while he was alive. (Which it didn\u2019t cost anything to be there when he was buried and we did visit while he was alive, so we were at the burial.) My grandma didn\u2019t like the idea at all. She wouldn\u2019t go against his wishes, but she didn\u2019t like that we didn\u2019t plan a funeral\u2026 until after. She ended up agreeing that it was easier. (He planned his own cremation and all that.) She ended up not caring if she had a funeral and decided to be cremated instead of embalmed.\n\nI\u2019m sure your aunt would agree, make arrangements in advance. You have the say on what is done, it\u2019s pre-paid, and your loved ones don\u2019t have to tackle it. They won\u2019t feel like they have to buy nicer whatever because what will people think. It just makes it all so much easier.", "NAH.\nYou may think that it's useless spending, but The funeral spending helps the people to grieve, it's not a complete waste of money.\nBut I wonder, why do you care about your funeral at all? Most probably, it would not be your problem. Sorry if I am too cynical.", "This is a very dumb thing to get mad about, honestly I think your NTA but that may just be because I wouldn\u2019t care whether my body got thrown into a ditch or tossed in a ravine.", "You\u2019re not an asshole for not wanting a funeral but of course it wouldn\u2019t matter for you as you\u2019re already dead, funerals are for the living so it\u2019s not fair for you to refuse your loved one that right to say goodbye to how they knew you. Funerals aren\u2019t for the person being buried, NAH", "NTA - the best end of life event I\u2019ve ever been to, was a lunch at a restaurant, with wine flowing. As per her wishes. We all told funny stories of our loved one, which got more & more into the secrets she kept through her life, that many of us didn\u2019t know, we started to understand why she did somethings & was a certain way. I see her in a different light now, I love her more. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing in the rule book that says you must have a funeral. It\u2019s an old tradition, one that needs modernising, because the cost is getting beyond ridiculous.", "It's your wishes. I don't want a funeral either.  Celebration of life is a bit different. If friends and family want to get together privately, I don't really have control over that. People grieve in different ways. If you have children, just consider what that may look like for them and consider their grieving processes,  I would think? . If this doesn't apply to you, you're dead and It won't matter if your friends and family want to get together.  You can state in your will no funeral and your preferences/wishes.  I agree with you.", "NTA - but as others have said, funerals are for the living. They don't have to be big and flashy and expensive. \n\nMy side of the family keeps it simple. When my grandparents passed, we scattered the ashes and reminisced. On my husband's side, when his mom passed, we had a barbecue and shared favorite memories.", "NAH. It's just a matter of differences.\n\nMy dad didn't want a funeral so we didn't have one. We were going to have a celebration of life day but another wave of covid came so we couldn't. A year later we ended up inviting some close family and friends to sprinkle his ashes at one of his favourite beaches. It wasn't overly expensive and it was lovely.", "NAH funerals are for the living. Rituals around death help with the grieving process. You are perfectly fine to say you don\u2019t want an expensive funeral. But no end of life celebration? That\u2019s messing with people\u2019s grieving process (just because you don\u2019t find it an important part of the process doesn\u2019t mean others don\u2019t)\n\nHow about- your family and friends get together at someone\u2019s house for a ceremony (your body is not there, it is dealt with separately). A few people make a speech or do a reading like they would at a funeral. People share stories of your life. There is some sandwiches and drinks. And that\u2019s it.\n\nIt\u2019s almost free (just sandwich ingredients and drinks). No one is looking at a box with your body in it. But it\u2019s enough of a ritual to help people grieve.\n\nIt seems from your comments you would be okay with that kind of thing. But if you say no end of life celebration to me, I would assume there should be absolutely nothing at all, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that\u2019s what your husband thinks. So maybe just not great communication here.", "I\u2019m kind of torn on this one. While I understand not wanting him to waste the money, if that\u2019s what he needs to get closure after you pass, I don\u2019t feel like you should tell him he CANT have a memorial, just maybe set forth limits or boundaries on finances?\nMy family is the same way and thinks funerals are a huge waste, and my husband and his family all think they\u2019re almost like a requirement\u2026 his one aunt is still in debt from his grandfathers\u2019 funeral and it\u2019s been almost 10 years since he passed.\nI personally agree that funerals CAN be a huge financial burden, but they don\u2019t have to be. So I guess final consensus is yes, yta\u2026 but I also definitely think there\u2019s a pretty simple compromise to be reached here.", "Funerals are for the living not the dead. But it doesn\u2019t need to be staring at a box. \n\nBut if you can spell out \u201cI don\u2019t want a funeral but I would like everyone to come to (this place, eg park, beach, restaurant, cabin, etc) and (do this eg dance the Macarena, tell funny stories, etc). \n\nFrom a personal perspective there were at least three funerals I would have liked to attend but could not either due to distance (physical and emotional), or other reasons. It wasn\u2019t until I got to another funeral that I was able to release my grief.", "NTA, & calling a funeral a \"right\" is twisted. It is expensive if you go the funeral home route. People will gather at some point & grieve, but it doesn't have to be in a funeral parlor. You're young, so you may change your mind in the future about all this. It sounds like he's coming from a place of care & wanting you to be respectfully memorialized (he'll die first. sorry. those are the stats), whereas you're into not paying an arm & leg for the honor. It's your body, do with it what you want.", "NTA. You can have whatever opinion you want on the matter. But remember that funerals are for the living. If it's worth it to those you leave behind to have a time and place to memorialize and remember you, and seek comfort together in grief, then what is the harm? Many people simply ask that any memorial contributions be given to the charity of the decedent's choice.", "Funerals/memorials are for the living.\n\nWhat my instructions are: after my cremation,  flush some cremains, laugh a lot  The rest go into the ocean. There is money for an old fashioned Irish wake (minus the body in the middle of the room) at a local pub. Lots of drinking and plenty of bar food. I wish I could be there!", "You can do a smaller celebration of life. We had my cousin\u2019s at his favourite pub.", "NAH. We are in our 30s with no kids. I\u2019ve told my husband that I don\u2019t want a funeral unless we have kids and they want one. I said if we do have one, I don\u2019t want an open casket, but again, if the kids want to come see me, they are fine to do so. \n\nWe had a similar situation with a family member - cremated but the kids went to see them before cremation, the service was after cremation.", "You're NTA.. BUUT.. You're already dead.. So who cares right? Sure you wouldn't want the people to go into debt just hosting you a funeral, but you're dead and you won't even feel bad about it at that point.. Ya know?\n\nBut I understand where OP is coming from too. Cause I'd rather just be cremated and my ashes cast in a cinder block and tossed into the ocean or even a septic tank. Cause I'm already dead and there's no need to waste money on me like that.\n\nTo each there own and it's an important conversation to have on the subject have in case. Put it in a will if you feel strongly about it", "No. I want to be taken to Australia and thrown in to the ocean with great whites. Nom, nom", "The funeral is not for the dead, it\u2019s for the living.", "Like others have said, you'll be dead and gone so while the funeral is about you, it isn't for you. Your husband clearly wants to have an opportunity to gather with your loved ones to honour you, mourn together etc.\n\nMaybe compromise by specifying you want an inexpensive celebration of life, with donations toward a cause that means a lot to you.", "I tell my wife I want to be stuffed and mounted with my arms overhead like a bear, and to be kept around in case she remarries so I can freak out the new guy. \n\nFunerals are for the living, though, so we\u2019ll see what happens. Or they will. I\u2019ll be dead, so I won\u2019t know.", "NAH - I don't think either of you are wrong.\n\nBut at the end of the day, Funerals and their surrounding rituals are about the living. The dead are already dead, and while holding their wants and desires can be important to those who knew the deceased, or important for moral/ethical reason like organ donation - They are fundamentally about the people they leave behind. So i advise a middle ground. Ask it to be a simple wake at a family members home where people come for an afternoon to walk and mingle. I think some call it a wake?", "NAH. \nEverytime I go to a funeral I end up thinking of what I would want\u2026 while I\u2019d prefer everyone just go eat together (eat all the feelings) and remember me, I\u2019ve also decided it\u2019s not necessarily about me\u2026. If I go before my loved ones and they feel they need to grieve me in a certain way, I tell them to do it because I\u2019m the end I\u2019m gone and they\u2019re grieving.", "NTA I think this is normal now.", "NAH, but I think you're mistaking the purpose of the funeral.  The funeral isn't for you... it's for the loved ones left behind.  You don't have to spend a ton... my uncle died last year and they had him cremated in a very low-cost way and we had a memorial potluck BBQ in his honour.  It cost the family very little, it gave us all an opportunity to come together and have a cry and share memories, and its something I know my uncle would have enjoyed.", "YTA for flat out not wanting a funeral. Funerals are more for a family to greive and let go / come to terms with a loved ones death and youre withholding that from them. NTA for not wanting an expensive one. Maybe suggest they can plan something small and close knit without loads of money being spent ?", "YTA\n\nYou get to decide what happens to your remains.\n\nYour loved ones get to decide how they need to deal with their grief.  If they want a funeral, they will have one for you.", "NAH. But funerals/end of life celebrations aren\u2019t really for the dead. They\u2019re for the living. \n\nYou should make a will stating exactly what you want your celebration to look like to ensure there\u2019s as little waste as possible.", "NTA. Funerals are for the living; if you don't want one, then that's your choice. It doesn't mean your loved ones are forever barred from having one. You'll be dead and won't care that they're being disrespectful to your wishes.", "NAH, but unless you put it in a will and have enough money to enforce your wishes. . . this is not something you get a say in. Funerals are for the living.", "The whole point of a funeral is to allow your friends, family, and loved ones to come together and grieve/mourn your loss. Obviously a big part of that is celebrating your life, but if that's all you're looking at (and therefore not wanting because you think it's an expensive waste), then you're overlooking the fact that it's a bigger part of helping the people who were important to you in life heal from your passing.\n\nSo yeah, bigtime YTA. People mourn and recover from loss in their own ways - telling your husband that you don't want any kind of funeral or celebration is essentially telling him that you would be against him grieving in one of the most basic ways possible, by congregating with other loved ones. That might as well be a slap in the face to someone who is already dealing with the trauma of losing a spouse, and a surefire way to create resentment if you stand your ground on this.\n\nPerhaps its possible that you're just burnt out from having to attend too many funerals in a short amount of time. That's understandable, and it's not wrong to want to feel a bit of distance from the thought of dealing with the stress and cost of one for yourself. However, ultimately, despite it being \"about\" you, a funeral or memorial service isn't ABOUT you - it's about people gathering to collectively heal from their loss.", "Not at all. I would think your husband is being a tad selfish for not wanting to respect your wishes. If you're serious and really put some thought into this, you need a will. I mean, everyone needs a will no matter what, but you should really consider it. Especially if you think your husband would go against them.", "NAH; light YTA.  Funerals are for the living, not the dead.  You are gone, so you won't know or care, but if you go before him, he may need that event as closure.  If he's upset about it, it's because you are not taking his feelings into account.", "While you are entitled to your opinion, the funeral is for the living in an effort to help them grieve. Not allowing that for your loved ones is selfish.\n\nYTA.", "It\u2019s your funeral you get to do what you want! Tell him you\u2019ll do the opposite of his directions and see how he likes that? He wants a big funeral? Tell him he\u2019s being cremated and put in a ziplock in the garage. You\u2019ll announce his death with a small Facebook status update. I\u2019m guessing he won\u2019t like that.", "Funerals are for the living not the dead.", "YTA. Funerals are for the living. For what it's worth, I agree with you, and I've vowed to haunt people from the beyond if they waste a ton of money on me.

Don\u2019t punish people who love you from your grave", "You are absolutely right I need a will, but I don\u2019t think he would lol he\u2019s just very strong willed with how he thinks.", "this is all under the assumption that they believe they won\u2019t exist after death plus them being gone doesn\u2019t mean their last wishes shouldn\u2019t be respected just to make others feel better that\u2019s like mad selfish", "You don\u2019t need something to allow you to grieve", "I\u2019m glad they were able to come together!", "In another comment I mention my coworker/friend whose dad passed away and they had a party at his favorite bar, with his favorite drinks, food, games and music. I thought that was endearing! I guess I\u2019d be open to something like that. Sounds like y\u2019all celebrated your Granny right ! Lol", "That\u2019s a beautiful tribute, and one I think plenty of people would feel grateful for and honored to receive", "EVEN BETTER!!! In the end, I truly think the best way to remember the dead is to HONOUR the dead, and the best way to honour the dead is by fulfilling their (reasonable) wishes. This is perfect \ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4", "Why?  They\u2019re dead.  My position is that I don\u2019t care what they do with my body when I\u2019m done with it.  Hold a funeral, prop it up in the corner, Tibetan sky burial, fire me out of a howitzer.", "Here's the thing, the dead cant talk so someone ends up speaking for them.  \n\nI know of a persons ashes currently being held hostage.  \n\nIt would be nice if they could be released to the blood relatives so they can be scattered. But there's seemingly no chance of that as they're now a possession belonging to someone.", "What about your family?", "The party is what my husband wants. He's already filled out the paperwork to donate his body to the medical school  in our city. \n\nMy son the doctor doesn't want me to donate my body. If he didn't I would do the same. But the thought of being pumped full of toxic chemicals and all the other indignities that go along with embalming and laying out of the body (my cousin was a funeral director and I basically grew up in the funeral home so I know what happens), having people come stare at what I consider the worst part of me as my spirit is not there, and then leaking toxic chemicals into the ground and water table for the next century or so is abhorrent to me.\n\nHubby and I agree with you and your aunt's opinion about who much of a waste of money and resources a traditional US funeral is. You're both still very young and hopefully very far from making the decision and maybe your husband will come around as you get older. Funerals, celebration of life, etc.are for the the living but that doesn't mean that the family has to go into debt.", "I agree 100%", "I told my husband I want to be burned on a funeral pyre (or just in nature period) and to have everyone eat good food and watch funny movies (especially some of my favs) when I die. Laugh. I love laughter.", "A pizza party does sound lit af lol", "(Ive been drinking, so apologies for grammar, soelling and rudeness) \nThe people whom perform funerals are the living. The only people with say in a funeral are the living. Rituals are determined, arbitrated, and finalized are the living. My living will includes the caveat of \"if you 4 cna agree on other methods, I am dead so do as you wish and I hold no ill will\"\n\nFailure to accept the fact that funeral rites are for the living is an issue of the living for their fear of death. Unless you subscribe to \"only my view of what happens after death is right\" it is the only rational conclusion. And I think trying to take that away is wrong.\n\nI dont want the christian \"though I walk through the shadow of the valley of death\" line said, to the point if i was alive id fight my father in a heartbeat, said at my funeral. I am dead. What I want is meaningless. Funeral rites are for the living. Ignoring the wishes of the dead only creates guilt in the living, but nothing else. So im.saying OP can either find a middle ground now, or die with the risk theyll ignore", "True but it seems like to her husband a \u201cfuneral\u201d of some sort is important to him. If I\u2019m not even around anymore and my partner wants to do something to help him grieve and relieve the pain who am i to say no", "You misunderstand. Funerals are for the living. They\u2019re for people to say goodbye to their loved ones. It\u2019s not about being selfish", "someone respecting their own wishes for their death is not punishing their loved ones. their loved ones are punishing themselves by not respecting their dead family member enough to be okay with their wishes. your family member just died an ur making their death about you an what would make you feel better about it , an not what they wanted for the literal end of their life? SELFISH. SELFISHHHHHHH", "You can't dictate how other people are expected to grieve. If the people left behind feel the need to have some sort of memorial service after you're gone in order to achieve some closure, then there's really nothing you can do to stop them unless you have incredibly powerful haunting skills. Dead people don't care about their memorial service, because... they're dead. Those things are strictly for the living.", "Maybe you don\u2019t but most people do. Humans have engaged in rituals and gatherings to honor the deceased since the beginning of time because gathering and rituals and celebrations (like a wake) were not invented by the funeral industry to make money.  Trying to control and dictate to your loved ones how they can grieve is a lousy thing to do to them", "I found out recently that you can buy the engines for hobby rockets in bulk for a decent price (I cant buy fireworks legally here) so that's how I'm going out.  \n\nMake a giant hobby rocket and put my ashes where the parachute is supposed to be.", "So your son, the doctor, who dissected a cadaver to get his medical degree, doesn't want you to give that gift to other future doctors?  How utterly selfish of him.  \n\nI plan on donating my body to a medical school once I've used it up, so that some bright eyed, young medical students can learn a thing or two.", "He can do a lot without having to spend thousands of my life insurance payout on a funeral to grieve.", "English must not be your first language but funerals are obviously not for dead people", "trying to control what happens to someone\u2019s body that they once occupied an disrespecting their literal last wishes is much lousier of a thing to do than not trying to make ppl feel better about themselves over YOUR death. ur a bad person", "It's not that. He told me he was very grateful to the person who donated their body. It was just too hard for him to think about me laid out being dissected because I'm his mom. It's the same as people who don't want autopsies on their family members even though it might answer questions. My youngest son is resistant to my being cremated. \"I hate the thought of you burning. I can't stand that idea.\"\n\nAlso, you do know you have to be real careful about how and where you donate your body. Sometimes it doesn't go for medical research but to companies that sell parts like cadaver bone and ligament tissues. Still helps people but not scientific research, just capitalism. Even some of the skeletons you see in museums are from people who thought they'd be contributing to medical research. There was a very good documentary on PBS about this.\n\nAgain, after the death whatever the family is comfortable with rules in my book. But if I can find one of the places that has a biodegradable bag to put me in and plant a tree of it I'm going to try and pay for it before hand.", "The burial is the expensive part...and that will happen with or without a funeral.", "Ok Skippy . Calm down and take your Meds and try again. That\u2019s not at all what I said", "There will be no burial for me. That\u2019s very clear lol", "So you'll be giving your body to science? Because if not, there are costs for getting rid of the dead."]}
