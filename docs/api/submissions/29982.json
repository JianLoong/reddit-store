It didn't make me happy that he was remarrying but I also told him I wouldn't stop him but he shouldn't expect me to be glad either (I was 9 at the time). By the time I finished high school and I had moved he told me I could not continue to be indifferent. That it upset his wife and children and I needed to try and find love for them. I told him I didn't want to. I told him he didn't need to worry because I wouldn't be around much. He said I shouldn't be around at all if I couldn't put forth the effort to try. I didn't and we went our separate ways.\n\nI did not have therapy as a child but did go as an adult. It did not change my lack of interest in building a relationship with my father's second family.\n\nA few weeks ago I was contacted by a half sibling who said they had all wondered about me and wanted to meet me. I declined saying I was not interested. The half sibling who contacted me asked for one chance to talk where they could see my face so we arranged a zoom call where they had questions for me. The biggest question was whether I regretted not trying and becoming so estranged from them. I was there to be honest so I told them I did not regret it and I still stood by it being the best decision I could have made. Even if going entirely estranged was my father's decision I do still think it was the best long term.\n\nThey did not like my honesty and they said I could have been kinder about it. I replied they are all adults and should not ask questions and expect lies in return. They said sugarcoating it at least. I asked what they would have looked like? Saying I always wondered what if when I didn't actually, saying I would always be fond of them? They called me cruel and heartless. They said seeing my Facebook profile where I clearly have very close relationships and I have children of my own and to not have that spark any desire to have my flesh and blood in my life was a cruel slap in the face for them. They insisted I shouldn't have been so blunt/honest. I told them it was best to end this and I left the call. I also blocked the half sibling who reached out to me. But they did find a way around that with another profile or two and DM'd me with a message that I'm an ass and how dare I.

You knew best what you needed as a traumatized adolescent whose mother just died\u2014  and your parents and SM and then your siblings should have respected that you chose as a traumatized 9 yo to reject your family. No one should *ever* have questioned that decision at all. They should never have asked you to examine that decision, your continued assertion of that decision\u2014 you had set boundaries (also known as walls) around yourself and those should ALWAYS be respected by your family.  It was abusive, cruel and manipulative for your father to ever suggest that maybe you should do some self-examination to see if you could ever feel any type of care for the only family you had and for siblings that loved you, which you rejected from birth because their mother tried to care for you too much.
