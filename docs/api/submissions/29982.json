It didn't make me happy that he was remarrying but I also told him I wouldn't stop him but he shouldn't expect me to be glad either (I was 9 at the time). By the time I finished high school and I had moved he told me I could not continue to be indifferent. That it upset his wife and children and I needed to try and find love for them. I told him I didn't want to. I told him he didn't need to worry because I wouldn't be around much. He said I shouldn't be around at all if I couldn't put forth the effort to try. I didn't and we went our separate ways.\n\nI did not have therapy as a child but did go as an adult. It did not change my lack of interest in building a relationship with my father's second family.\n\nA few weeks ago I was contacted by a half sibling who said they had all wondered about me and wanted to meet me. I declined saying I was not interested. The half sibling who contacted me asked for one chance to talk where they could see my face so we arranged a zoom call where they had questions for me. The biggest question was whether I regretted not trying and becoming so estranged from them. I was there to be honest so I told them I did not regret it and I still stood by it being the best decision I could have made. Even if going entirely estranged was my father's decision I do still think it was the best long term.\n\nThey did not like my honesty and they said I could have been kinder about it. I replied they are all adults and should not ask questions and expect lies in return. They said sugarcoating it at least. I asked what they would have looked like? Saying I always wondered what if when I didn't actually, saying I would always be fond of them? They called me cruel and heartless. They said seeing my Facebook profile where I clearly have very close relationships and I have children of my own and to not have that spark any desire to have my flesh and blood in my life was a cruel slap in the face for them. They insisted I shouldn't have been so blunt/honest. I told them it was best to end this and I left the call. I also blocked the half sibling who reached out to me. But they did find a way around that with another profile or two and DM'd me with a message that I'm an ass and how dare I.
