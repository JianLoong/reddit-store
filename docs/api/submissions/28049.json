She's exhausting to be around and while you enjoy the photos you don't have the mental control to visit in person without saying anything that would upset her. Maybe tell her that you do a lot for her already and you've had to do stuff without her help.

When she needs/wants something, you're expected to go running. But when you need/want something, it's \"Poor me, I can't because XYZ\". I'm sure it was inconvenient for at times to host things for her or to participate in her wedding. But does she care? No. If the situation was reversed and you had a newborn, would she hop on a plane to meet the baby? It's time to stop giving in to her every want and need. That doesn't make you cold, it makes you assertive. If she wants a sister bond, she needs to put more of an effort. And her husband? He needs to mind his own damn business.", "You are NTA for telling her \"I'll see you at Christmas.\"\n\nIf she continues to harass you, remind her that you're in a different place in life than her -- she's a mother and you're not -- and it's not fair for her to expect you to be a co-parent. Tell her that she needs to make friends with other mothers of newborns in her area. (I'm not even going to touch the subject of why she doesn't seem to be getting the support she needs from her husband.)\n\nIf you're feeling generous, suggest to her that she look for local Mommy groups who can support and encourage her. Meetup. com is a good place to look, as well as local neighborhood Facebook groups.  The local Library may be able to refer her to local groups. Even a non-local Facebook Mommy group would be helpful to her.", "NTA.  There's clearly a reason why she doesn't have many friends.", "NTA \n\nSounds like a lot going on, being between jobs, sister increasing communication, having history of feeling like a one sided relationship, etc. My guess is that your sister loves to share and be the attention, but has NO awareness or consideration for others and their situations.

Them saying you \"have more bandwidth\" because you have time / aren't a new parent is just b.s. You can respond to that nonsense with being out of \"bandwidth\" in regards to sister and her family.\n\nOP, it's ok to need time and space away from the people and things that cause us stress and fill up our \"bandwidths\". In fact, because you are not dependent upon them for your physical, financial, nor emotional needs/fulfillment, saying no is perfectly fine. \n\nIt's understandable that your sister, as a new mom, is getting a bit burnt-out, but that's on her and her husband to resolve, not you. Besides, financially, flying to meet them when you're between jobs isn't the smartest idea. In fact, that smells to me like your sister thinks she'll use the opportunity to convince you to move closer to her so she can use you as her sole support system. Keep saying no, find that new job, enjoy some you time. And do what I do when I need a break from my fam - put texts from them as no push notification, put their phone numbers as on silent/vibrate only, but let them know you're taking a break from them (as I can honestly say I didn't inform my mom of doing this once and she called the cops to report me missing; btw, it was under 12 hours since our last call at that point, I live 2+ hours away in a different police district, and had a housing emergency she was unaware of which was one of the reasons I didn't respond immediately - sorry, mom, little busy trying to fix the roof over my head in the middle of winter in the northern hemisphere!!)", "You would be the AH to yourself and would snap and make things worse if you don't work on the boundaries now. \n\nI believe in matching the energy - if she tells you about the struggles of being a new mom, you can share your struggles at work or your lifestyle back.

At this point MY only suggestion is to speak to your doctor if you are struggling this much - they are the professionals.\n\nI said I would see you all at Xmas because that is the only guarantee I can currently give. My life cannot stop just because you have given birth, and quite frankly all this pressure from you and your husband is making not want to even come then.
