She's exhausting to be around and while you enjoy the photos you don't have the mental control to visit in person without saying anything that would upset her. Maybe tell her that you do a lot for her already and you've had to do stuff without her help. Tell her until she starts acting like a sister you'll be happy to just keep seeing photos.\n\nBuuut I'm kind of an asshole so maybe it's not the best advice.", "Nta your sister is looking for free babysitting", "NTA.\n\nThis relationship is very one sided. When she needs/wants something, you're expected to go running. But when you need/want something, it's \"Poor me, I can't because XYZ\". I'm sure it was inconvenient for at times to host things for her or to participate in her wedding. But does she care? No. If the situation was reversed and you had a newborn, would she hop on a plane to meet the baby? It's time to stop giving in to her every want and need. That doesn't make you cold, it makes you assertive. If she wants a sister bond, she needs to put more of an effort. And her husband? He needs to mind his own damn business.", "You are NTA for telling her \"I'll see you at Christmas.\"\n\nIf she continues to harass you, remind her that you're in a different place in life than her -- she's a mother and you're not -- and it's not fair for her to expect you to be a co-parent. Tell her that she needs to make friends with other mothers of newborns in her area. (I'm not even going to touch the subject of why she doesn't seem to be getting the support she needs from her husband.)\n\nIf you're feeling generous, suggest to her that she look for local Mommy groups who can support and encourage her. Meetup. com is a good place to look, as well as local neighborhood Facebook groups.  The local Library may be able to refer her to local groups. Even a non-local Facebook Mommy group would be helpful to her.", "NTA.  There's clearly a reason why she doesn't have many friends.", "NTA \n\nSounds like a lot going on, being between jobs, sister increasing communication, having history of feeling like a one sided relationship, etc. My guess is that your sister loves to share and be the attention, but has NO awareness or consideration for others and their situations. And that honestly is on her. You don\u2019t have to bend over backwards just because she wants you too. It sounds like she takes advantage of the fact that you are loyal and family to get away with being selfish in relationships. It\u2019s okay to take care of yourself instead for a change.", "NTA.", "Nta. But kinda yta for not telling them the truth.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
