Especially if you try and shoot down everything they do say.", "people go on and on about natural consequences and letting kids experience them, wouldn't having to wait for her hair to grow out if she hated being bald have been a good example of that?", "You\u2019re hung up on semantics. It has been explained to you what the comment meant, and you\u2019re choosing to dig your heels in. People shouldn\u2019t have to spend forever typing their comment to include \u201cexcepting of course *all of these super obvious mandatory (surgery) or permanent (tattoos) things* that everyone knows exist and could come up.\u201d\n\nWe all know what it meant. Move on.", "I'm pretty sure there have been instances where children of about that age have emancipated themselves so that they did have control over their lives and their bodies. \n\nThe law agrees that this should be possible, so I don't think you have a leg to stand on here. \n\nA parents' job is to keep their child safe and fed and educated. Not to police what children do with their bodies. \n\nThe arguments about tattoos or surgery are moot because the tattoo industry will not tattoo a minor, and kids can poke and stick if they're really determined. \n\nAnd no surgeon in their right mind would be performing surgery on a minor without some kind of emancipation order or a guardian present and informed. Unless it was some sort of emergent surgery. What kind of surgery do you even mean??\n\nSo. You're wrong. Accept it.", "YTA. Actually, a shaved head is something you can reverse fairly quickly. I would have let her do it if she felt that strongly about it. As your husband said, it could have been a lesson in itself.\n\nHowever, your husband should have respected your decision and not gone behind your back. Waiting a month was a reasonable compromise.", "YTA\n\nHair grows back. Let her explore while that's still true. My kid shaved hers at 13. Her hair, her decision. \n\nI was like her when I was a kid. Okay, so she regrets it in a week, teaching moment. It grows out, but it takes time.\n\nI never shaved mine, but I have developed alopecia as an adult, and now I cherish the years where doing what I wanted with my hair was a possibility.", "YTA\n\nI feel like there\u2019s more to this story than you\u2019re letting on.  A 16 yr old wouldn\u2019t be pissed off for a month just because their parents told them to wait.\n\nMy guess is either when she asked or after she shaved you yelled at her about it and berated her.", "Yta\n\nWhen I was in middle school I finally got to shave my hair all off, I had been wanting go do so for ages by that point, but my mom was wary to let me until that day, where we actually talked and she finally let me.\n\nTurns out, I actually look really damn good with a shaved head, but even if I didn't, I still absolutely adored having a shaved head to the point I shave my head every summer since then.\n\nTurns out kids are capable of choosing for themselves what they like, including what they want to do with their hair. And it's super fuckin telling that your kids hair is still properly shaved, it's actively being maintained\n\nMakes me wonder a lot about what you couldn't be telling us on reddit", "There is missing information here. On the surface, asking her to wait to see if she still wants to shave her head is not unreasonable. Neither is a teenager being a teenager. So how did it escalate to this point?", "YTA. While I probably wouldn\u2019t want my daughter shaving her head either, I\u2019d be devastated to not see one of my kids for a month. \n  \nThe fact that you haven\u2019t at least sucked it up and apologised or tried to reason it out for the sake of the relationship shows everyone that there is some toxicity issues that you need to get in check.", "YTA. If you're gonna allow blue hair and green hair and all that, don't be surprised when shaved is next. Hair grows back. I was the same way at that age and my mother freaked out all the time because *she* was embarrassed of my appearance. Now I'm a middle aged woman with a head full of normal, beautiful hair and my relationship with my mother still sucks. Pick your battles.", "YTA\n\nI'm frankly baffled as to what you think your ex or even YOU could have done to prevent a 16-year-old from shaving her head anyway--Not in a disciplinary sense, but a practical one. She could make that happen any time she wanted, so long as there was a sink and a razor. If she's into alt fashion, she's definitely got friends with clippers who could bring them to school and do it during lunch. It's just one of those choices that you have to shrug and let teenagers make if they're that determined.\n\n(I feel like there's a story you're not telling us about her suddenly choosing to spend most of her time at her dad's.)", "YTA. Something\u2019s off here.", "YTA if shaving her head was a mistake, it's her mistake to make and she wouldnt learn anything if you made the decision for her.", "YTA honestly I don't even see why she should ask you permission to cut her hair with her own money. It's her head. If it was a permanent thing like a tattoo it would be different but that's just hair.", "To start, OP, YTA\n\nWhen my daughter was 16, she and a friend went to the mall, where a radio station was giving out concert tickets. I was driving with our other 2 kids, and the radio announced that \"some chick, is getting her head shaved, for tickets\". All three of us immediately knew who the \"chick\" was. And guess what, she LOVED it. She's 41 now and still laughs about it. It's just hair, it will grow back.\n\nBut something seems to be missing from your story OP. Why was she staying at dads more and more, and why has she chosen not to return home?", "ESH. Your ex and you should be on the same page and letting her get the hair cut seems like going behind her back. However it seems like you are leaving out a lot of your relationship with your daughter, seems like an extreme response. Based on what you\u2019ve said, I would say N T A but because it seems you\u2019ve left out key details, it\u2019s at least ESH", "YTA. *She* owns *her* body, not you.", "I love how everyone is arguing different points, back and forth. Damn good questions by the way. But, and truly, no offense:\n\nNon of it matters lol.\n\nShe's 16! Even if a parent is stupid enough to believe they should have control over 16yo child's hair, there are clippers and razors literally everywhere!\n\nI cant stop laughing at all this serious discussion going into this thread.", "Exactly, I was in college in a city across the country in my own bedsit when I was 17. Im laughing picturing me needing permission for a haircut at 16. Shaved it, grew it, shaved it, bobbed it, grew it, shaved it, spiked it, grew it, dyed it every colour under the sun.  \n\nI'm now nearly 40 with a bleach blonde shaved undercut. Let the lass own her own hair.", "Yes, I was working at fourteen, but needed parental consent.  At sixteen you can work without parental consent.  Lots of teens start working part time in school to pay for cars, gas, movies, clothes, etc.", "This. So much. My mother would buy me clothes that I wouldn't be seen dead in except my only other choice was being naked. I was an 80s punk kid, and my mother always bought me preppy clothes.\n\n\nWe also had issues over my hair leading to her kicking me out when I was 18 because I had shaved the sides of my head while keeping  the top chin length. Oh... she also doused my boots in gas and attempted to burn them when I had done the same 6 months earlier on my last day of high school. Her excuse was that it was going to ruin my graduation pictures... which are about the graduates mother, right? Of course that hair style was really easy to style in a way that makes it just look like a good clean cut... and when those pictures came in she gushed about how handsome I looked while I just stewed over my boots when she did so. That episode was one of the wake up calls about my father as well. The fact that he wouldn't replace my boots with the same style was such a weak ass move. Especially because I had bought them with my own money in the first place.\n\n\n\nJokes on her though. She's the one that lives a lonely miserable life now. None of her grand children give a shit about her either. Last I heard, she is living in a low income high rise that is literally across the river from the street where she grew up. If you are on a high enough floor, you can see her old house. So, she has literally gone nowhere in life and has nothing to show for it. Not even family.", "I have an undercut and if I don't maintain it, I have hair that counts as too long in probably three weeks.", "Eh, I think a lot of it is that like. The parent does not deserve to think that they have the right to control their kid like this. Like, it won't really change OP's mind, no, but there's going to be some kid who comes across this while scrolling reddit and goes \"huh wait. that's NOT normal?\" \n\nAlso OP's an asshole.", "I got my mate to give me a Mohawk with his clippers when I was round his house aged 17. Mum wouldn\u2019t have had a say in any of it and I didn\u2019t ask.", "That's how I got my first undercut. Mom left the house, came back to about 2 ft less hair on my head", "I think a lot of parents have parented their children through a lot of regrets. This parent clearly speaks to their child\u2019s impulsive changes to their appearance\u2026 and generally seems supportive. Even my hair stylist says they will ask clients what\u2019s going on in their lives if they want to make drastic changes she\u2019s never heard them talk about before and suggest waiting one appointment to make sure they still love the idea. \nKids often don\u2019t realize their favorite famous influencers have access to wigs, $, stylists, free products etc. Like- cool that you love that super short look on your favorite influencer but do you recognize that when they snap a pic in butt length hair in a few months that you\u2019ll still have a pixie cut and it\u2019ll be a year before you have a pony again. Normal people can\u2019t afford it.", "Absolutely. But there\u2019s nothing wrong with teaching your kids to wait to make sure something is what they want. Teens are notoriously impulsive. There\u2019s tons of studies showing an increased need for instant gratification due to media consumption habits etc. A month of waiting isn\u2019t outrageous. It\u2019s not a crazy concept to attempt to teach your kids to wait to make sure you don\u2019t change your mind.", "Not everyone has hair that easily grows back. If I cut off all my hair it would take quite a while to grow back to its current length", "I was a \"good kid\" in the sense that I always asked my mom or at least said \"I'm doing this\" but I was also a brat that didn't listen to no about stuff like that. By the time I was 16 though, my mom had basically given in and just said \"don't cry to me if you do something you hate\".", "My ma used to dye her hair in her mates' baths, and so she was fully expecting and prepared for me to do the same thing.\n\nImagine her confusion when I asked HER to do it instead. My logic was that if she'd spent all those years dyeing her hair, surely she was my best bet for getting the job done right first try round. And I was absolutely correct, I'll still take my ma doing my hair over a hairdresser any day.", "My hair days are long gone now unfortunately but I\u2019m glad I did what I could with it while I still had it. And that\u2019s how it should be. Glad you could experiment too without getting into trouble."]}
