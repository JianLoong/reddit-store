That's all fine by me, she's at that age where she'll be exploring and experimenting.\n\nShe's also dyed her hair just about every color at one point or another, also fine with me. She came to me last month and asked if she could shave her head, I guess she saw some celebrity or something who'd done the same. I told her to wait a month to be sure, since that isn't something you can reverse easily, and I don't want her regretting it after a week later.\n\nShe responded to that by calling her dad right in front of me, and asking him the same. He ended up siding with me, and I thought that was the end of it, but no. She went over his house the next day, and apparently shaved her head that afternoon. I called her father and told him off, I said I was pissed he went behind my back after we had an agreement.\n\nAnyway that was a month ago, and she hasn't come back since. I'm friends on snapchat with her and apparently she's still loving and maintaining the bald, which surprises me but I'm glad.

My mom told me if I ever cut my hair (that is curly and atp down past my butt and I HATED it so much) she'd disown me at 16. I shaved it down to a buzz and dyed it hot pink. I asked for a nose piercing that I'd pay for at 17, she said if I ever pierced any of my body she'd, you guessed it, disown me. I have 12 piercings. So on and so forth.
