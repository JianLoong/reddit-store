He ended up siding with me, and I thought that was the end of it, but no. She went over his house the next day, and apparently shaved her head that afternoon. I called her father and told him off, I said I was pissed he went behind my back after we had an agreement.\n\nAnyway that was a month ago, and she hasn't come back since.

My younger sister was 14 or 15, just went to the mall, bought red manic panic in hot topic, and dyed her hair in the hotel bathroom. Rebellious teens will find a way, lol.", "It's pretty impressive to me how parents can't even begin to fathom the idea that their kid might have been thinking about something for a long damn time before they ever said anything about it to you. Especially if you try and shoot down everything they do say.", "people go on and on about natural consequences and letting kids experience them, wouldn't having to wait for her hair to grow out if she hated being bald have been a good example of that?", "You\u2019re hung up on semantics. It has been explained to you what the comment meant, and you\u2019re choosing to dig your heels in. People shouldn\u2019t have to spend forever typing their comment to include \u201cexcepting of course *all of these super obvious mandatory (surgery) or permanent (tattoos) things* that everyone knows exist and could come up.\u201d\n\nWe all know what it meant. Move on.", "I'm pretty sure there have been instances where children of about that age have emancipated themselves so that they did have control over their lives and their bodies. \n\nThe law agrees that this should be possible, so I don't think you have a leg to stand on here. \n\nA parents' job is to keep their child safe and fed and educated. Not to police what children do with their bodies. \n\nThe arguments about tattoos or surgery are moot because the tattoo industry will not tattoo a minor, and kids can poke and stick if they're really determined. \n\nAnd no surgeon in their right mind would be performing surgery on a minor without some kind of emancipation order or a guardian present and informed. Unless it was some sort of emergent surgery. What kind of surgery do you even mean??\n\nSo. You're wrong. Accept it."]}
