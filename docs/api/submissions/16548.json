I work for Doordash; I budget my money tightly every month and give myself weekly quotas that I have to meet. If I don't, I start cutting down on what I'm saving or what I'm spending on fun things.

Went voluntarily homeless and traveled the country. \n\nHe was also majorly suffering from mental health conditions and was self-medicating with as much pot as he could possibly smoke. \n\nHe spent a year living on the streets.\n\nHe came home and finally got help from the VA and is now regularly employed, medicated, and doing well. He doesn\u2019t regret going voluntarily homeless, but he definitely said he has a better appreciation for the folks that are homeless that do a lot for other homeless folks.

Your ex wife is an enabler.  Reading this makes me so angry.  I am the opposite of your son.  Left home at 18 because parents were terrible at being parents and move aboard to work.  Came back to UK a few years later and continued working.  Never asked for any money and none was offered to me from said parents.   \nOnce a person past the age of 21, they are an adult and is responsible of being one.

No matter how much you give him, it will never be enough, and he\u2019ll badmouth you behind your back regardless. So you might as well just cut him off now. You\u2019ll get painted the villain either way.\n\nHad an uncle like this. Grandparents kept feeding him money, he burnt through it. Bought him a house so he could have somewhere comfortable for his young kids, he destroyed it. Cigarette smoke pervaded everything, sold the kids\u2019 furniture, moved his girlfriend and her kid in, and his own children slept on couches. The place lost all value.  When my grandfather was in hospice, he came to visit and take him out and acted like the prodigal son\u2026 until he found out my grandfather had no control over the estate and had signed over power of attorney.  Then he disappeared. That is, until the funeral, where he tried to steal every decoration that wasn\u2019t nailed down (half of it belonged to the church, and the other half belonged to the grandkids). \n\nHe\u2019ll still tell anyone who\u2019ll listen that my grandparents screwed him over.", "NTA, he needs to wake up to reality and get a job to pay for what he wants.", "ESH.

Unfortunately if he is in the Bay area, talk is cheap and everyone is full of hot air posing around trying to sell their vaporware product to whichever fool will invest in it.

The millionaires that do make it mostly worked their butts off.", "NTA", "Im guessing hes been cut out of your will then ?", "NTA. You're just letting everyone know your side 1st and not enabling this 40+ yr old to scam you and hopefully other family members.", "NTA. In fact, you were NTA as soon as you mentioned crypto investments. Crypto is nothing but a scam.", "NTA. Sounds like my BIL.  My husband has 6 siblings and oldest brother never really had a job.  Always working the phones waiting for the deal that would make him rich.  Hit us up for a \u201cloan\u201d  numerous times.  Turned out he was hitting the other sibs as well\u2014FOR YEARS.  None of us knew about the other \u201cloans\u201d until a SIL put her foot down and started asking questions.  An email like the one OP sent would have saved us all time and money.  My BIL died penniless, living in one sister\u2019s basement, but still working the phones 10-12 hours a day while assuring everyone that we would all be repaid as soon as he closed the deal.", "NTA. This ain\u2019t Neverland, so Junior there is going to need to figure out how to grow up. Now\u2019s a great time to start that process.", "NTA You're right  - surely his millionaire friends are in a better position to loan him money than you.", "NTA but you would be TA if you ever seriously entertained one of these get rich quick schemes. I have a friend just like this. He\u2019s beyond delusional. He\u2019s a 39 year old virgin who thinks he can get any girl he wants. He wants a super model virgin from a wealthy family. He also wants to build a $250MM school to help poor children (but some how the tuition will cost $10K a year). He\u2019s under all these delusions and at this point I\u2019ve concluded that there\u2019s no hope for him. I truly believe that once someone hits their 30s they\u2019ve pretty much settled into their natural station in life. Once you hit 40, unfortunately it\u2019s virtually impossible to chang your mindset. \n\nSo yes you\u2019re doing the right thing and it\u2019s good you made sure no one else will fall for his schemes.", "NTA. It's beyond time to cut him off", "NTA. You're just protecting people from a scam, same as you'd warn them about any scam doing the rounds. Perhaps your ex wife would pay his back rent for him."]}
