I don't know how your kid ended up this way, but homeboy needs some serious therapy and a reality check. I understand not wanting to work a traditional job, and I understand not wanting to work retail or something, but he's also clearly not putting effort into being worthy of a high-paying position, and if he's not disabled or something it's also just kind of weird that he won't try and do anything that would give him a livable wage. I work for Doordash; I budget my money tightly every month and give myself weekly quotas that I have to meet. If I don't, I start cutting down on what I'm saving or what I'm spending on fun things. I'm 20. Your son is ridiculously immature, and he's lying and manipulating people on top of that -- gross.
