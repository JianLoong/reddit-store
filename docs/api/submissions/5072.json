We take a seat on the patio and I see that their is a dog a few tables over. It is medium sized and very furry.  I order my drink and also ask the server what is up with the dog.  He just says it is a service dog and there isn't much we can do so they let it in.  I get my drink and keep an eye on it.  Wife says to let it go and ignore it, I don't.  It barks once.  Then the owner (i'd guess a lady in her 20's) picks it up.  She puts it on the seat next to her.  Pretty sure its a health code violation to allow a dog on a restaurant seat.  Then the dog puts its paws on the table. Owner does not notice this.  \n\nI speak up, she is a few tables over so I i'm like \"Hey, get your dog off the table and off the seat\". She snaps back mind your business.  The dog starts barking at me.  I let her know without cussing that its gross to allow her dog on the table and seat, I also said service dogs don't bark at strangers.  We went back and forth arguing.

I know a dog at a table in a restaurant isn\u2019t the same as my experience, but fake service dog owners deserve to be called out. Maybe if you embarrassed them enough at the restaurant they won\u2019t put that dog in a position where it can hurt someone. Probably not, but I\u2019m hoping.

Anyway....tough cookies.  Service dogs ARE allowed, by law, to be in most public areas, as some people rely on them greatly.

Service animals ARE well and highly trained, and don't deserve your insults or wrath.  This lady, with the dog, behaved badly.  You are right....it is gross to have an animal up on a surface where people eat from.  However, you should have taken that up with the manager or asked to be moved to another location.  Just as bad as a badly behaved pet owner is in a restaurant or public area?  A badly behaved person who wrecks everyone else's experience by confronting and arguing with another patron with something that wasn't your business to handle like that!
