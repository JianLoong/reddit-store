If you were actually concerned about the health risks, you could have easily just flagged a waiter to make them aware, so they could decide whether they wanted to talk to her or just sanitize more than usual once they left\n\n>he dog starts barking at me\n\nIt sounds like you ruined a good time, and the dog spoke up about it.", "YTA.", "YTA", "ESH. You humiliated your wife and caused more conflict than you would have if you'd just let it go.\n\nThe lady sucks for abusing the policy because she wanted to bring her pet, it is not a service animal.

There are many services in which a dog may be trained to bark. Honestly, from the discription the OP gave, it sounds like the dog may have been a diabetic alert dog, and it may have done a singular bark to alert that it may have sensed her blood sugar was low, so she brought it up closer to her to \"Smell\". The dog barking \"At him\" may have been the dog responding to the scent of her breath when she was telling him to mind his own business.\n\nIn this case, he definately TA. \n\nPeople have this horribly poorly informed idea of what a service dog is and what they do, to the point they may not understand why a chihuahua can be a diabetic alert dog, or even what Orbiting is for a PTSD Psychiatric dog. They may not even understand that sometimes a singular bark is an alert and IS A TRAINED RESPONSE.\n\nI am autistic and have a service dog and he is trained to first paw at my leg when he has sensed I am having a moment of crisis, as he can tell before I or others can see it. If I don't respond, he barks once in a very specific way that lets me know I Have to sit down NOW. If I don't have a chair to sit down on, I will sit against a wall even in the store, then he will lie over me and give me DPT. I have had people yell at me in stores or in restauraunts because they think my dog is untrained because they do not understand the services he does and why I need him or what the services I need look like. He is also trained in orbiting, and I cannot tell you how many times someone has grabbed my dog's leash in a store thinking they were \"helping me\" when he was doing his orbiting. Check yourself and your knowledge before assuming what a service dog does.", "If a man is shouting at the handler and the dog it\u2019s kind of a stressful situation for both.", "That's why they aren't allowed on them.", "I'm going to say that you saying that hurts disabled people, as a disabled person with a Service dog.\n\nWhen reading the OP's post, I instantly knew the lady who had the dog most likely had a diabetic alert dog. These dogs are usually kept in a sling close to the owner's breath, but at a restauraunt may be on a chair close by, and may need table access if they alert . When they smell ketones on the breath of the diabetic person about to have an insulin issue, they bark once. If the diabetic person ignores them, they may bark more, maybe even multiple times to insist severity. \n\nWhat this read as was : Dog barked to alert possible ketones but was too far away that the owner brought the dog onto the chair to see if it would alert again. Dog proceeds to leverage itself on the table to get a better whif at owner's breath. Op does the dick thing and calls out a service dog doing a service cos he doesn't know what service dogs do. Owner rightfully tells him to mind his own business. The Yelling may have made the dog trigger a more serious alert and start a prolongued barking. It also says a bit that they're at a restauraunt, and was probably waiting for her meal, as she probably knew her insulin was low.\n\nOp is TA here.", "Of course.

They do not put their paws on tables. And they do not bark. This was clearly an eMotIOnal SUppOrt dOg.  Maybe ESH bc that other customer was obviously lying about their dog bc they were an entitled asshole.", "The narration sucks, however, it is FUCKING DISGUSTING for an animal to \\*sit on a seat and a table at a FUCKING restaurant.

I posted this elsewhere, but this is what the scenario looked like to me, who IS familiar with what Service dogs do:\n\nDog barked to alert possible ketones but was too far away that the owner brought the dog onto the chair to see if it would alert again.

The Owner's breath and yelling back at him may have made the dog trigger a more serious alert and start a prolongued barking. \n\nThem arguing may have made the dog continue alerting. Yes, they are trained to prolongue bark if the owner does not take steps to alleviate the issue or command the dog to stop. Who knows why? but most likely it was her being tired of just another person who is an ass to her about her service dog and wanting to put him in his place first. I've been there a few times, where my dog is insistantly giving me his Alert chirp and I'm in the midst of a full blown meltdown/panic attack while also yelling at the person telling me my dog isn't a \"Service dog.\"", "yes, because Diabetic alert dogs need to be close by the owner's face to alert. At restauraunts, that may be in a chair. If they sense something, they may put their paw on the table and lean up to get a better smell. That's how they work.", "Absolutely.

It very well may be an ESA, which does not hold the same standards as a service dog, but the server may not know the difference.

It was laying by the owner's feet under the table. The only time I ever saw that dog even blink, was when they got up to leave after their meal. A legitimate service dog will not bark at other people, or get to get up on the seat or table. I also work at a hotel, that does not allow pets, but we HAVE to allow services animals or we are in violation of the ADA. BUT according to the ADA if the \"service animal\" is disruptive or a nuisance, we can most certainly kick out the animal. Can't kick out the owner though, have to give them the option to stay WITHOUT the animal. \n\nI'm giving OP a \"soft\" YTA. It clearly was not a service animal, but he should have said something to the staff, and not the owner, but I also understand the desire to call out a liar that claims their pet is a service animal.", "You are making an awful lot of assumptions about both parties in this situation.", "Not so. If the dog is that small that it needs a chair or table, which they don't because a dogs sense of smell is so incredible, hence, they smell your blood sugar, it can however sit in a sling that the owner is wearing.", "Exactly, like he laid out that he is the type of person to stare at a dog and be hypercritical of all of their behaviors because he was looking to make an issue because he doesn't like dogs. He's not a reliable narrator to say whether or not the dog was displaying appropriate behavior or not, because he was fixing to have a fight over the fact there was a dog even there cuz he doesn't like dogs", "Yup!  A dog doesn\u2019t need to be on a seat or table to alert anyone.", "The dog didn't, people are just jumping to wild conjecture just as the poster did", "No, Just reading the situation as told from the eyes of someone who actually knows service dogs and knows people who hate dogs and hate service dogs around them. Op's barely given anything, and we know there's always two sides. If the Restauraunt verified it's a service dog, he should have minded his own business, period, and he didn't. End of story. From there, yes, I will assume it is a service dog, because most know how to weed out the fake ones in my experience.", "you're vastly overestimating the scent range of a medical alert dog, and sitting at a table with a dog in a sling on your chest at a restauraunt is unfeesable and uncomfortable.\n\nDogs DO have a more powerful sense of smell, but there is still a range. Even bloodhounds have to have their nose mostly to the ground to determine the different scents, and their direction incoming. You're basically saying that any medical alert dog can walk around like a normal dog and alert from any range and that's simply untrue. And with the proliferation of Keto diets out there, they have to be able to be close to differentiate ketones on their owners breath from those around them. They don't \"Smell your blood sugar\" they smell concentrations of Ketones that are emitted in breath. Basically the owner takes a sample of their saliva when they're at a near-crisis point, and this amount is used to train the dog to alert. The dog smells the level of ketones and alerts, they don't SMELL YOUR BLOOD. That's laughable.", "actually, what the op discribes sounds like the dog was a diabetic alert dog. They are trained to bark if they smell ketones on their owner's breath. She may have brought him closer/onto the table for him to make sure, and her telling him to stfu and the dog alerting pretty vocally afterwards to the smell of her breath when she was saying something may have also been what happened. Tbh, the op just sounds like someone not aware of what service dogs do nowadays and how many ways they are trained, Same as you if you didn't think Diabetic alert dog from his discription.", "You can't possibly know what the first bark was about.", "Precisely.

That actually makes a lot of sense", "Ok", "A person with lice, mites, crabs, bacterial infections, etc. might sit at a table as well. You\u2019re much more likely to be affected by parasites or disease from being near people than dogs.", "Oh please. Lice don't live on dirty people. Crabs? Do you think they're sitting their bare genitals on the table? Bacterial infections? Are they bleeding and getting bodily fluids on the table? Doubt it.\n\nDogs are dirtier than people."]}
