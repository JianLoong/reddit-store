Funerals are for the people mourning, not for the person who has died. So if you don't want/need/whatever to go, you don't have to. Period.", "ESH. It sounds like your Mom was terrible but you still should have gone to the funeral. Brother is AH for the way he confronted you. Threatening him with an ambulance was also an AH move on your part. The rest of the family coming after you makes them AHs too. \n\nBut its all done and over with now. Leave the past in the past. Life gave you a bad Mom, but life goes on.

Of course you were (are!) upset about that.  You're human.  Parental rejection makes for a deep, painful, recurring wound.  Your brother is... well, not to put too fine a point on it, but it's thickheaded of him not to realize that.  Your brother is stupid, I'm sorry.\n\nNTA though.  You visited her to see about reconciliation (presumably) and she rejected you.

Ha.\n\nAre these the same family members who took you in when you mother illegally kicked you out?  If they aren't, then you are certainly under no obligation to listen to them.
