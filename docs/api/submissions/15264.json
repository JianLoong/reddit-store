They should have told her to apologise prior to the party and then asked if you are comfortable having her around.", "NTA for the reasons you already stated. Almost any other day would have been fine, but this was a party for you on your birthday, when you should not have to relive that bullying. It was a selfish act to only make herself feel better.\n\nEdit to add: I feel like people are also ignoring the semi-public \"surrounded by friends\" setting here. Sam designed this to be a spectacle that would play out in a specific way so you could not just kick her out without conflict. You basically had to accept her apology or you'd be the bad guy. There was no way out of this that would have kept you happy and I'm in full support of you not falling for that bullshit.", "NTA. I hate it whenever someone tries to dictate what someone else is allowed to feel. Coming home to a surprise party is overwhelming in a good way. Then seeing your bully and tormenter (from not so long ago) was the exact opposite. Kind of like emotional whiplash. \n\nIf she reached out to your friends to apologize, I don't understand why they didn't talk to you about it first. Not just to be sure you would be receptive but also to make sure you were mentally prepared. \n\nStaging an apology this way, in front of a crowd, puts the entire burden on you. You have to either tell her all is forgiven or you're the bad guy. Either way, the bully gets off scott free. \n\nI am also skeptical that she is really sorry. She probably heard about the party and just wanted to attend. If so, then she just got away with bullying you again.", "Absolutely NTA. If she truly wanted to apologize, she should have chosen a more private situation. As you described it, it looks more like she just wanted to publicly show herself as a better person than she really is. Like why on earth would you want to do that in front of everyone? Also, considering that all the \"friends\" supported her, I would have just left too.", "NTA\n\nMaking a spectacle of an apology at a party takes away some of the authenticity of it for me personally. It should have been done in private, when OP was ready to confront their bully on their own should they so choose.", "NTA - people get more upset at the victim for reacting, more than at the perpetrator for perpetrating. You can\u2019t decide how someone else should react to something surprising and hurtful. She may have been there to apologize but it is not the right setting. Also, you can forgive her (if you want) and still not want her at your birthday party celebrating with you as a friend. I think this was a bad call on your friends\u2019 and family\u2019s part, and they owe you an apology (edited). \n\nMaybe it would have been better to privately ask her to leave and then stay and enjoy your party but hindsight is 20-20. Curious what others think\u2026", "NTA sam wanting to apologize is reasonable i guess? but it\u2019s up to you to accept it or not and it\u2019s INSANE that anyone would thing your birthday party is a good place for that to occur", "NTA. This is fundamentally no different to a public proposal of marriage to manufacture an undesired \u2018yes\u2019.", "You're nta, you are not entitled to accept someone's apology just because they want to give one. She should have reached out, and asked you if you wanted to meet up in person, or she could have apologized over a message. To have someone who verbally and physically abused you be standing right in front of you, on what is supposed to be a happy occasion to celebrate you is messed up. I have no clue why your family or friends would think its okay to trigger your trauma on your birthday. Seeing someone who hurt us just brings us back to everything they did, and that's the last thing you need on your birthday. Wrong time, wrong place, wrong way to do that. Your fam is TA", "There's no way around the fact that it ruined the party for you, despite everyone's intentions.\n\nIf anyone knew that Sam had been mean to you in the past, it was a huge mistake for them to invite her. A birthday party with friends is not a place for an apology from a tormentor.\n\nI guess your friends aren't dealing with any leftover bully trauma, so they don't get the effect that this could have on you.\n\nAnyway, sure\u2014it would have been great if you could have been civilized and not made a fuss, but we don't always have our full capacity for etiquette in every situation, and you did what you had to do to take care of yourself. NTA.", "If Sam rally wanted to apologize she should have reached out to you and talked with you at a moment of your convenience. A real apology is more than just saying 'Sorry' and then enjoying your party. A real apology contains recognition, responsibility, remorse and efforts to undo the harm done. \n\n**It isn't showing up** **at your birthday party.** If she was serious she would have stayed away.\n\n*I started getting messages saying that it is ungrateful that I left after they gathered everyone, spent so much money & time, and planned everything so far ahead.*\n\nIf they wanted the surprise to be a happy one for you, they shouldn't have given into your bully's request of being invited.\n\nShe made you feel uncomfortable at your own surprise birthday party, and this even managed to turn some 'friends' against you.\n\n*They also said that it was rude of me to confront and embarrass Sam in front of everyone as she was \"literally there to apologize\".*\n\nIt was rude of Sam to show up, it was rude of your friends to invite her. It is rude of your friends to not understand what Sam put you through, and it is rude of your friends to not realize after you walked out how your bully and her past actions still affect you.\n\nIt is also very rude of Sam and your friends to use peer pressure to try and make you accept your bully's apologies.\n\nWhich she hadn't given yet. So we don't know if she would have apologized. \n\nFor the moment she is still your bully and she got to enjoy YOUR surprise party without your presence. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Although we agree that you probably should have been the bigger person and stayed. However, it was your day and you could have reconciled any other day. Your friends should have known this if they knew that you had been bullied (yes, they didn't know the specifics between you and Sam, but Sam would have said to the friends that she did bully you and wanted to apologize). They should have known not to invite an ex-bully on your birthday.", "NTA.\n\nIf Sam wanted to apologize, it should have been done privately, not at a birthday party. And your friends should not have invited her without knowing exactly what she did or how you would react. They screwed up, not you.\n\nThat said, you could have handled it better, both there (I appreciate what you want to do Sam, but this isn't the time or place, leave me your number and I'll call you some other time) and afterward (If Sam is gone, I'll come back, I know you meant well, but it really was a bad choice without checking with me first). Sam's bullying was traumatic as hell for you, so your reaction was understandable, but you missed an opportunity to take control of your past and your trauma and move forward. You missed an opportunity to fix what they did wrong (in having her show up at your party unexpectedly) and in essence you victimized yourself again by ruining your birthday party when it was poised to be such a fun, gratifying, and uplifting event. They damaged the start of your party, but you let yourself be victimized in a way which ruined the whole party. I'm sorry, but harboring such ongoing resentment and unresolved trauma is harmful to you and will continue to hurt you in life.\n\nGo to therapy - or back to therapy - or address this with your current therapist. Have them help you decide whether an apology from Sam will help you, and how to get that apology in a safe and productive way. Have them help you decide the best way forward with your friends. Your friends seem to really like you and be pretty awesome, except for this one big faux pas, which likely comes from not understanding the nature or depth of your trauma or the right way to help you resolve it and Sam apologize for it.\n\nSam has grown up a lot since then, it sounds like. You don't owe her anything, but what you owe yourself is probably different from what you are thinking. Giving her an opportunity to apologize and ask for absolution may be a gift you give yourself.\n\nThink carefully about how to move ahead from here for your emotional health and stability and healing. Victimhood may be emotionally gratifying on a weird level, but its not a healthy coping mechanism and why victimize yourself?", "i just don\u2019t understand why you wouldn\u2019t tell her to leave instead of ditching the party that they threw for you??", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
