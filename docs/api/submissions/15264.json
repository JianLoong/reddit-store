I was so happy and felt so loved as I had always planned my own parties previously but never had a surprise one. I looked around the room and saw Sam (19f) who used to bully me for about 2.5 years back in high school. She would tease me, make comments about my appearance, spread rumors, and physically hurt me.

I was so happy when they first surprised me but I felt like crying after I saw her. I went up to Sam and simply told her \"what made you think I wanted you here on my own birthday?\" in front of everyone.

They should have told her to apologise prior to the party and then asked if you are comfortable having her around.", "NTA for the reasons you already stated. Almost any other day would have been fine, but this was a party for you on your birthday, when you should not have to relive that bullying. It was a selfish act to only make herself feel better.\n\nEdit to add: I feel like people are also ignoring the semi-public \"surrounded by friends\" setting here. Sam designed this to be a spectacle that would play out in a specific way so you could not just kick her out without conflict. You basically had to accept her apology or you'd be the bad guy. There was no way out of this that would have kept you happy and I'm in full support of you not falling for that bullshit.", "NTA. I hate it whenever someone tries to dictate what someone else is allowed to feel. Coming home to a surprise party is overwhelming in a good way. Then seeing your bully and tormenter (from not so long ago) was the exact opposite. Kind of like emotional whiplash. \n\nIf she reached out to your friends to apologize, I don't understand why they didn't talk to you about it first. Not just to be sure you would be receptive but also to make sure you were mentally prepared. \n\nStaging an apology this way, in front of a crowd, puts the entire burden on you. You have to either tell her all is forgiven or you're the bad guy. Either way, the bully gets off scott free. \n\nI am also skeptical that she is really sorry. She probably heard about the party and just wanted to attend. If so, then she just got away with bullying you again.", "Absolutely NTA. If she truly wanted to apologize, she should have chosen a more private situation. As you described it, it looks more like she just wanted to publicly show herself as a better person than she really is. Like why on earth would you want to do that in front of everyone? Also, considering that all the \"friends\" supported her, I would have just left too.", "NTA\n\nMaking a spectacle of an apology at a party takes away some of the authenticity of it for me personally. It should have been done in private, when OP was ready to confront their bully on their own should they so choose.", "NTA - people get more upset at the victim for reacting, more than at the perpetrator for perpetrating. You can\u2019t decide how someone else should react to something surprising and hurtful. She may have been there to apologize but it is not the right setting. Also, you can forgive her (if you want) and still not want her at your birthday party celebrating with you as a friend. I think this was a bad call on your friends\u2019 and family\u2019s part, and perhaps you owe each other apologies for the misunderstanding. \n\nMaybe it would have been better to privately ask her to leave and then stay and enjoy your party but hindsight is 20-20. Curious what others think\u2026", "NTA sam wanting to apologize is reasonable i guess? but it\u2019s up to you to accept it or not and it\u2019s INSANE that anyone would thing your birthday party is a good place for that to occur", "NTA. This is fundamentally no different to a public proposal of marriage to manufacture an undesired \u2018yes\u2019.", "You're nta, you are not entitled to accept someone's apology just because they want to give one. She should have reached out, and asked you if you wanted to meet up in person, or she could have apologized over a message. To have someone who verbally and physically abused you be standing right in front of you, on what is supposed to be a happy occasion to celebrate you is messed up. I have no clue why your family or friends would think its okay to trigger your trauma on your birthday. Seeing someone who hurt us just brings us back to everything they did, and that's the last thing you need on your birthday. Wrong time, wrong place, wrong way to do that. Your fam is TA", "There's no way around the fact that it ruined the party for you, despite everyone's intentions.\n\nIf anyone knew that Sam had been mean to you in the past, it was a huge mistake for them to invite her. A birthday party with friends is not a place for an apology from a tormentor.\n\nI guess your friends aren't dealing with any leftover bully trauma, so they don't get the effect that this could have on you.\n\nAnyway, sure\u2014it would have been great if you could have been civilized and not made a fuss, but we don't always have our full capacity for etiquette in every situation, and you did what you had to do to take care of yourself. NTA.", "If Sam rally wanted to apologize she should have reached out to you and talked with you at a moment of your convenience. A real apology is more than just saying 'Sorry' and then enjoying your party. A real apology contains recognition, responsibility, remorse and efforts to undo the harm done. \n\n**It isn't showing up** **at your birthday party.** If she was serious she would have stayed away.\n\n*I started getting messages saying that it is ungrateful that I left after they gathered everyone, spent so much money & time, and planned everything so far ahead.*\n\nIf they wanted the surprise to be a happy one for you, they shouldn't have given into your bully's request of being invited.\n\nShe made you feel uncomfortable at your own surprise birthday party, and this even managed to turn some 'friends' against you.\n\n*They also said that it was rude of me to confront and embarrass Sam in front of everyone as she was \"literally there to apologize\".*\n\nIt was rude of Sam to show up, it was rude of your friends to invite her. It is rude of your friends to not understand what Sam put you through, and it is rude of your friends to not realize after you walked out how your bully and her past actions still affect you.\n\nIt is also very rude of Sam and your friends to use peer pressure to try and make you accept your bully's apologies.\n\nWhich she hadn't given yet. So we don't know if she would have apologized. \n\nFor the moment she is still your bully and she got to enjoy YOUR surprise party without your presence. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Although we agree that you probably should have been the bigger person and stayed. However, it was your day and you could have reconciled any other day. Your friends should have known this if they knew that you had been bullied (yes, they didn't know the specifics between you and Sam, but Sam would have said to the friends that she did bully you and wanted to apologize). They should have known not to invite an ex-bully on your birthday.", "NTA.\n\nIf Sam wanted to apologize, it should have been done privately, not at a birthday party. And your friends should not have invited her without knowing exactly what she did or how you would react. They screwed up, not you.\n\nThat said, you could have handled it better, both there (I appreciate what you want to do Sam, but this isn't the time or place, leave me your number and I'll call you some other time) and afterward (If Sam is gone, I'll come back, I know you meant well, but it really was a bad choice without checking with me first). Sam's bullying was traumatic as hell for you, so your reaction was understandable, but you missed an opportunity to take control of your past and your trauma and move forward. You missed an opportunity to fix what they did wrong (in having her show up at your party unexpectedly) and in essence you victimized yourself again by ruining your birthday party when it was poised to be such a fun, gratifying, and uplifting event. They damaged the start of your party, but you let yourself be victimized in a way which ruined the whole party. I'm sorry, but harboring such ongoing resentment and unresolved trauma is harmful to you and will continue to hurt you in life.\n\nGo to therapy - or back to therapy - or address this with your current therapist. Have them help you decide whether an apology from Sam will help you, and how to get that apology in a safe and productive way. Have them help you decide the best way forward with your friends. Your friends seem to really like you and be pretty awesome, except for this one big faux pas, which likely comes from not understanding the nature or depth of your trauma or the right way to help you resolve it and Sam apologize for it.\n\nSam has grown up a lot since then, it sounds like. You don't owe her anything, but what you owe yourself is probably different from what you are thinking. Giving her an opportunity to apologize and ask for absolution may be a gift you give yourself.\n\nThink carefully about how to move ahead from here for your emotional health and stability and healing. Victimhood may be emotionally gratifying on a weird level, but its not a healthy coping mechanism and why victimize yourself?", "i just don\u2019t understand why you wouldn\u2019t tell her to leave instead of ditching the party that they threw for you??", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That was an extremely low blow for them to bring your tormentor to what should have been a happy day for you and expect you to suck it up. You need some better friends.", "Sam may want to apologise but she is not owed anything from you and her thinking this was the time or place was - outrageous. As for your friends - what were they thinking?\n\nFor the ones that don't know the history I would send a message saying that your former bully attended your party and after suffering from years of trauma at her hands you felt unable to remain. NTA", "NTA, I dont understand people when they think that an event (birthdays, wedding, etc) are the times to have heart to hearts like\" I sucked as a human being, sorry for making your life suck for years\"  fyi thats not the time.  Case and point what happened here... you probably would've like to have celebrated your party.", "Imo the bullying hasn't stopped. Putting you in this position is bullying in and of itself, trying to publicly humiliate you in front of a crowd. I would tell Sam to pound sand and get bent, you're not forgiving her because she hasn't changed. NTA.", "NTA and your friends are bullies too.", "NTA - I'd honestly probably find better friends if they thought that bringing your bully to your birthday party was acceptable behavior", "NTA inviting your bully to your birthday party without telling you is massively inconsiderate. She may be honestly sorry, but you may not be ready to talk to her. What else did they expect, a Hallmark moment? I had many bullies in high school and the only place I want to see them is in the obituaries.", "NTA!!! You should never apologize for the way you react to someone mistreating you. I was personally bullied a LOT throughout school and would never want any of them around me or my family. They should have asked her to leave.", "NTA\n\nThat sort of shit should never happen at important events.  She wants to apologize, she texts you, maybe ask you out for coffee and a talk.\n\nEveryone else should have known that real life ain't like a Hallmark movie and you weren't ready for a reconciliation attempt.", "NTA. Sam showed up to bully you more making her the giant asshole. Also get new friends. The ones you have are obviously dumb and don\u2019t know how to protect their friend from more trauma and expect you to apologize. F that.", "So did your friends plan the party to help sam apologize or for your birthday?", "I\u2019m going to go with NTA. Sam could\u2019ve picked a different day to apologize if she really wanted to.\n\nBut, I dont think you shouldn\u2019t have left.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not ok to stage that kind of apology at a birthday party, let alone surprise you with it.", "NTA\n\nA celebration of your existence is not the time or place for a bully to make amends.", "\" I'm starting to feel like I should have been the bigger person and stayed, but just ignored Sam. \"\n\nOr how about you laugh and enjoy your friends and find some time to talk to Sam and listen to what they had to say. Sometimes we can get over trauma by addressing it straight on. Some have suggested Sam chose this time because of peer pressure. I disagree with this. I think she ran into someone who knew you at UNI and saw an opportunity to let you know how sorry she was. \n\nPeople grow up and change. I'm sure you're different than you were 2 years ago, and they are also. Why not give Sam a chance to make it up to you? You were surrounded by friends, it was the best place possible for you to have a conversation with them. You certainly don't have to forgive them, but why hold this anger inside? Why not talk it out and let it go?\n\nNTA, of course, but I think you should have stayed.", "DON\u2019T SPRING FORMER ABUSERS ON THEIR VICTIMS!!!!!!!   Ever.  Just don\u2019t do that.   It is never ever appropriate.   NTA.", "NTA and I 100% understand why you left, but if something like this ever happens again, make her leave. It's your freaking birthday party, she can go to hell", "NTA- and whoever invited Sam is a HUGE TA.  Also the person/people who invited Sam and are giving you grief for walking away are not your friends.  I would simply tell them how what they did and the guilt trips after made you feel, let them know that they are not friends and then block them.", " they should have reached out to you. I'm assuming they got in touch with your friends and asked them to attend? That is bizarre behaviour in my mind.", "Yep.  Sam has had all the time in the world to apologize in private.  She chose OP's birthday, when there would be tons of people around. That's super gross and manipulative.  OP is NTA.", "It appears the bully is still bullying the OP. Now even post-party the bully is having new friends bully OP. It's an effective bullying tactic and heartbreaking for OP. NTA, I'm sorry you are dealing with this.", "Sam could have approached or reached out to you at any time to apologize but chose the worst time and place to do it.", "[deleted]", "Op was bullied publicly, what OP did is perfectly valid and courageous. I for one am very proud.", "I think that i am mostly suspicious of your friend that coordinated with sam, and your friends that thought this was a good idea.", "OP - this is the way. They need to know and it can't hurt that Reddit agree with you. NTA. \n\nBut after that, I would talk with your friends and ask what were they thinking and how did Sam even know about this happening so she could reach out? Something seems off about her just showing up and your friends did you a huge disservice on what should have been a special event for you. Hugs.", "Because when people are confronted with people who have caused them trauma, it sparks a fight or flight response.", "If you\u2019d rather be friends with a bully over someone who was rightfully upset, what does that make you?", "What evidence is there that Sam can grow and change?  She ambushed OP at her birthday party; she knew OP likely wouldn't want to talk to her, which is why she didn't reach out to OP directly. \n\nShe manufactured a situation where she looks good to OP's friendss because she came forward to apologize,  or she gets sympathy if OP acts the way she did. \n\nThat's not growth, it's still bullying.", "yeah that would have been the best thing to do definitely. i guess it was just something i did in the heat of the moment without thinking about the consequences.", "Like a public proposal, you are pressuring the other person to accept no matter how they feel about it. If Sam was really serious about apologizing, it should have started in a private message that you could ignore until you were ready.\n\nNTA", "This also to me shows Sam 100% hasn\u2019t changed. She\u2019s still bullying you she\u2019s just covering it better. She knew exactly what she was doing. I\u2019d be she only was apologizing to look like a better person- I\u2019m sure she was doing it so she could post it and show what a great person she is \ud83d\ude44.\n\nNTA- I get your friends didn\u2019t know you and Sam so they may now know the extent of what she put you through but ask them why they think she had to do the apology on your birthday in front of everyone? Ask them why if she wanted to apologize she had to hijack your birthday party for her apology?\n\nIf they can\u2019t see that this is so blatantly obviously just a show apology purposely organized to all but force you to accept the apology than they\u2019re idiots.", "Definitely better or more genuine ways to do it. Just get her ph# and start with a text or something.\n\n\nOne of my bullies went out of his way to smoke a huge blunt with me at a party near the end of HS and apologized. We had a good talk and I respected him for it.", "But not on her birthday.", "So people can't change. No redemption ever. It was in high school. Grow up. And that make me an adult.", "She knew. You're 100% sure. No, you're not neither of us can be. Like I said, OP was an asshole to her friends not Sam. But it seems everyone loves a victim enough to super impose theories and make up a whole judgement about this one persons behavior as a teen/child. My reasoning for OP being an asshole stands, her very actions was that of an asshole. Im Not just basing everything on a theory that Sam knew this would upset her. He'll I'm not even saying she should forgive her. But yall are actually just assuming Sam's motives are mean spirited (which they might be), but noone knows not even OP cause she ran.", "I think it was better you left than she did, if you said \"get out of my party\" in front of everyone, the people who invited her in the first place would try their hardest to keep her there with \"but she's changed!\", \"she's here to apologize!\", etc.\n\nIf you had kicked her out, the party atmosphere would be ruined, everyone would just be there awkwardly looking at each other thinking \"should we sing happy birthday? How do we continue here?\", so I think you did fine with what you were given.", "Genuine question- Now that the heat of the moment has passed, how has been with your friends? Are they more understanding?", "There would be such a range of emotions to process I can't even imagine. NTA and I am so sorry that happened to you.", "I had the exact same thought: this is like a public proposal when the relationship is on the rocks.", "I\u2019m sorry, but not everyone can change. I was bullied from age 11-16. We are 18/19 now and the same people who claimed to have changed and matured just did the exact same thing now like they did when we were teens. \n\nComments hurt, they always will. No matter how long ago they were said. I constantly think about the words my bullies said to me, even when we were friends for a brief moment i couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. There\u2019s no growing up from being bullied, it fucking hurts dude.", "Yeah, I'm pretty darn sure. Because Sam didn't reach out to OP, but still somehow found out about her birthday party and asked to attend. \n\nYou're also super-imposing theories that Sam has grown/ changed.  What are you basing that on?  Your own imagination, that's all. \n\nSo don't go getting all self righteous.  \ud83d\ude00", "my family was mad to begin with but not anymore as they knew me around the time sam bullied me and understand how hurtful it was for me. as for my friends, some have apologized for getting mad while others are waiting for me to apologize.", "I'm sorry, that's why I said she is not the asshole to her bully. She does not have to forgive Sam, but to her friends who went through the effort it was a shit move. She could have just asked Sam to leave, and while I understand trauma she shouldnt use that as an excuse to behave that way to her friends.", "I'm guessing the people that think you owe them an apology are the ones that you met after high school?\nI'm sorry an awesome thing got ruined by people who should have known better!\nDo you. Think showing them your post would help, or just add fuel to the fire?", "honestly a bit of both! some high school friends believe i shouldn\u2019t be salty anymore as it\u2019s been 2 years since she bullied me"]}
