They should have told her to apologise prior to the party and then asked if you are comfortable having her around.", "NTA for the reasons you already stated. Almost any other day would have been fine, but this was a party for you on your birthday, when you should not have to relive that bullying. It was a selfish act to only make herself feel better.\n\nEdit to add: I feel like people are also ignoring the semi-public \"surrounded by friends\" setting here. Sam designed this to be a spectacle that would play out in a specific way so you could not just kick her out without conflict. You basically had to accept her apology or you'd be the bad guy. There was no way out of this that would have kept you happy and I'm in full support of you not falling for that bullshit.", "NTA. I hate it whenever someone tries to dictate what someone else is allowed to feel. Coming home to a surprise party is overwhelming in a good way. Then seeing your bully and tormenter (from not so long ago) was the exact opposite. Kind of like emotional whiplash. \n\nIf she reached out to your friends to apologize, I don't understand why they didn't talk to you about it first. Not just to be sure you would be receptive but also to make sure you were mentally prepared. \n\nStaging an apology this way, in front of a crowd, puts the entire burden on you. You have to either tell her all is forgiven or you're the bad guy. Either way, the bully gets off scott free. \n\nI am also skeptical that she is really sorry. She probably heard about the party and just wanted to attend. If so, then she just got away with bullying you again.", "Absolutely NTA. If she truly wanted to apologize, she should have chosen a more private situation. As you described it, it looks more like she just wanted to publicly show herself as a better person than she really is. Like why on earth would you want to do that in front of everyone? Also, considering that all the \"friends\" supported her, I would have just left too.", "NTA\n\nMaking a spectacle of an apology at a party takes away some of the authenticity of it for me personally. It should have been done in private, when OP was ready to confront their bully on their own should they so choose.", "NTA - people get more upset at the victim for reacting, more than at the perpetrator for perpetrating. You can\u2019t decide how someone else should react to something surprising and hurtful. She may have been there to apologize but it is not the right setting. Also, you can forgive her (if you want) and still not want her at your birthday party celebrating with you as a friend. I think this was a bad call on your friends\u2019 and family\u2019s part, and they owe you an apology (edited). \n\nMaybe it would have been better to privately ask her to leave and then stay and enjoy your party but hindsight is 20-20. Curious what others think\u2026", "NTA sam wanting to apologize is reasonable i guess? but it\u2019s up to you to accept it or not and it\u2019s INSANE that anyone would thing your birthday party is a good place for that to occur", "NTA. This is fundamentally no different to a public proposal of marriage to manufacture an undesired \u2018yes\u2019.", "You're nta, you are not entitled to accept someone's apology just because they want to give one. She should have reached out, and asked you if you wanted to meet up in person, or she could have apologized over a message. To have someone who verbally and physically abused you be standing right in front of you, on what is supposed to be a happy occasion to celebrate you is messed up. I have no clue why your family or friends would think its okay to trigger your trauma on your birthday. Seeing someone who hurt us just brings us back to everything they did, and that's the last thing you need on your birthday. Wrong time, wrong place, wrong way to do that. Your fam is TA", "There's no way around the fact that it ruined the party for you, despite everyone's intentions.\n\nIf anyone knew that Sam had been mean to you in the past, it was a huge mistake for them to invite her. A birthday party with friends is not a place for an apology from a tormentor.\n\nI guess your friends aren't dealing with any leftover bully trauma, so they don't get the effect that this could have on you.\n\nAnyway, sure\u2014it would have been great if you could have been civilized and not made a fuss, but we don't always have our full capacity for etiquette in every situation, and you did what you had to do to take care of yourself. NTA.", "If Sam rally wanted to apologize she should have reached out to you and talked with you at a moment of your convenience. A real apology is more than just saying 'Sorry' and then enjoying your party. A real apology contains recognition, responsibility, remorse and efforts to undo the harm done. \n\n**It isn't showing up** **at your birthday party.** If she was serious she would have stayed away.\n\n*I started getting messages saying that it is ungrateful that I left after they gathered everyone, spent so much money & time, and planned everything so far ahead.*\n\nIf they wanted the surprise to be a happy one for you, they shouldn't have given into your bully's request of being invited.\n\nShe made you feel uncomfortable at your own surprise birthday party, and this even managed to turn some 'friends' against you.\n\n*They also said that it was rude of me to confront and embarrass Sam in front of everyone as she was \"literally there to apologize\".*\n\nIt was rude of Sam to show up, it was rude of your friends to invite her. It is rude of your friends to not understand what Sam put you through, and it is rude of your friends to not realize after you walked out how your bully and her past actions still affect you.\n\nIt is also very rude of Sam and your friends to use peer pressure to try and make you accept your bully's apologies.\n\nWhich she hadn't given yet. So we don't know if she would have apologized. \n\nFor the moment she is still your bully and she got to enjoy YOUR surprise party without your presence. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Although we agree that you probably should have been the bigger person and stayed. However, it was your day and you could have reconciled any other day. Your friends should have known this if they knew that you had been bullied (yes, they didn't know the specifics between you and Sam, but Sam would have said to the friends that she did bully you and wanted to apologize). They should have known not to invite an ex-bully on your birthday.", "NTA.\n\nIf Sam wanted to apologize, it should have been done privately, not at a birthday party. And your friends should not have invited her without knowing exactly what she did or how you would react. They screwed up, not you.\n\nThat said, you could have handled it better, both there (I appreciate what you want to do Sam, but this isn't the time or place, leave me your number and I'll call you some other time) and afterward (If Sam is gone, I'll come back, I know you meant well, but it really was a bad choice without checking with me first). Sam's bullying was traumatic as hell for you, so your reaction was understandable, but you missed an opportunity to take control of your past and your trauma and move forward. You missed an opportunity to fix what they did wrong (in having her show up at your party unexpectedly) and in essence you victimized yourself again by ruining your birthday party when it was poised to be such a fun, gratifying, and uplifting event. They damaged the start of your party, but you let yourself be victimized in a way which ruined the whole party. I'm sorry, but harboring such ongoing resentment and unresolved trauma is harmful to you and will continue to hurt you in life.\n\nGo to therapy - or back to therapy - or address this with your current therapist. Have them help you decide whether an apology from Sam will help you, and how to get that apology in a safe and productive way. Have them help you decide the best way forward with your friends. Your friends seem to really like you and be pretty awesome, except for this one big faux pas, which likely comes from not understanding the nature or depth of your trauma or the right way to help you resolve it and Sam apologize for it.\n\nSam has grown up a lot since then, it sounds like. You don't owe her anything, but what you owe yourself is probably different from what you are thinking. Giving her an opportunity to apologize and ask for absolution may be a gift you give yourself.\n\nThink carefully about how to move ahead from here for your emotional health and stability and healing. Victimhood may be emotionally gratifying on a weird level, but its not a healthy coping mechanism and why victimize yourself?", "i just don\u2019t understand why you wouldn\u2019t tell her to leave instead of ditching the party that they threw for you??", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's your birthday and you don't need anyone you don't want there.  Perhaps you need to reconsider your new \"friends.\"", "This is awful. NTA! Someone give me Sam\u2019s number and I will give her a long needed lecture. Sam is TAH.", "The timing and event were just blatantly wrong of your friends and bully to have her there. You did what was best for you after being forced at your birthday party of all places to have to remember the shit your bully put you through for 2.5 years. You had every right to leave and if your friends believe you were selfish and rude for leaving, then they need to think about this again and realize that are TA and not you.", "Totally NTA! OP, I support you in walking out!!", "NTA you shouldn\u2019t have to deal with a bully on your bday any real friend would know this", "NTA but what sitcom did this idea come from? \"Surprise! It's your old nemesis. Happy birthday!\". I can't imagine anyone thinking it would have gone well. There are 364 other days to attempt mending fences. Especially ones that aren't blindsiding.", "NTA.  NTA.  And did I mention NTA?  Because you're definitely not.  It was healthy to remove yourself from a toxic situation.", "Definitely not an asshole, do they not know how awful being bullied is? How traumatic? The PTSD? If someone who abused you wants to apologize you should clearly be able to decide if you even want to entertain that apology and most definitely not on your 20th birthday. I don\u2019t see you being an asshole at all, you stood up for yourself and knew to leave and I think that\u2019s awesome. If your friends see this thread they need to apologize to you and plan another party.", "NTA. So sorry that happened to you.", "I've got an estranged family member that I'm not on good terms with try something similar to this. It's a calculated maneuver to make you play nice and do what they want publicly. \n\nNTA. But you were put in a situation designed to make you look like one. Honestly the best way to do it is basically what you did. It means you don't care about looking like an asshole, you won't be pushed around.\n\nI had to be a little more creative with mine because even talking to them would just encourage them to do that more (i have to think 3 moves ahead in the social chess with this person). But for a former bully that you want cut out of your life, nah a direct confrontation in public is perfect.", "NTA. Your birthday is a time to celebrate you, not force you to relive your high school trauma (which is pretty recent) and for you to have to hear your former bully\u2019s apologies. Maybe you could\u2019ve reconciled with her, but this probably set you back emotionally. It should\u2019ve been on your terms. I\u2019m so sorry.", "NTA. If anything, you should've stayed but kicked her out.", "NTA. Well done for not giving in to an ill-mannered and unforgivable ambush. Your friends are crap for doing this. They should apologise to you. If they wanted a spectacle for your birthday they should have booked a juggler.", "esh-I mean you could of asked her to leave and you stay.", "You're NTA for being angry that your bully was invited.\n\nBut to yourself, you let her presence RUIN something you wanted AGAIN.  \n\nI think you should have ignored her and enjoyed your friends.\n\nIf she approached you, then you should have said, \"*You are not welcome, Please leave*.\" \n\nIf she tried to apologize, say, \"*Not interested\"* and turn and walk away.\n\nAs an adult you had your power, but the only power you took was to run away mad.", "NTA. But I think you should have at least made the attempt.", "yta. you admit your friends didn\u2019t know. how was storming up to your room better than just telling sam to leave? you literally could have said this is my party and I don\u2019t want you here, please leave. as an adult you need to be able to problem solve and have difficult conversations. storming off was incredibly rude to the people who threw you the party", "NTA.  She is not a friend and no reason she should have been there at all even for an apology.  Your friends ruined their own party and your birthday.  If Sam was sincere she would have come up with a different approach to reach you for the apology.  It sounds very manipulative on her part and given the history I would  question the sincerity.  Also question your friends thinking this was a good idea knowing your history.   You could have accepted her apology and not have her at your birthday.  She is not a friend.", "Nta", "NTA But you shoulda laughed and said \"gtfo my party\" and once shes gona you could explain your behaviour. Its your party dont let some asshole ruin it.\nBtw happy birhday", "Yeah, like others are saying: NTA. I was bullied relentlessly from kindergarten to the end of highschool, it really didn't simmer down until I dyed my long, long hair black, pierced my lower lip (which wasn't really a thing yet back then, and yes, I am old....and I still wear my lip jewelry \ud83d\ude43), wore dark makeup and only black clothes, I was basically a goth before goth was a thing (back then it was viewed as being \"satanic\". If ya started to show some goth tendencies, you'd sooner or later burn down a church and/or kill someone \ud83d\ude44). Apparently, that made me look like I was on the verge of some kind of violent breakdown, so they chickened out and left me alone. I weirded them out, which was fine by me, and gradually I made good friends, and broke out of my very battle hardened shell. If ANYONE had invited one of those bullies who made my life a living hell, to a surprise bd-party, I don't think I would have been as graceful as you. I sure wouldn't have stayed, tho.", "NTA. If Sam truly wanted to make amends, they would have done so in private. Given your history with them, surprising you at your birthday party was tactless, thoughtless, and cruel of them.", "NTA. If Sam was there to apologize, then why didn't she walk up to you and do it as soon as you arrived?\n\nA party for you was not the place for her to do it.", "Ew, NTA. If someone invited my childhood abuser, or even just the one school bully I dealt with (who never physically hurt me but still,) to my birthday because \"he wants to apologize\"? I would be even less civil than you were. Hands would probably be thrown. I'd at least curse him out and then have a very, very long talk about power dynamics with my \"\"\"friends\"\"\" and family who agreed to it.\n\nMoon and stars. I hope they realize what a shitty move that was.", "They should be embarrassed for inviting your former bully Nta", "NTA. Sam made it about her. \n\nI am sorry she ruined things yet again for you. She might be a little obsessed.", "YTA\n\nYou let a single person derail all that work and effort made in your name.  You are small and petty.  One person out of how many? 20? 30? 812? Like holy shit you are so simple minded.", "NTA, and I'm not judging, but I am curious.  Why did you leave instead of demanding that the bully leave?", "NTA, this honestly just looks like a continuation of her prior conduct, albeit a bit more sophisticated. Good on you to call her out.", "NTA. She's a manipulative little B\\*\\*\\*. I don't know if your friends know the back-story, but on realizing what was happening, they should have asked her to leave immediately.", "NTA. All the effort of a surprise party, sweet as it is, is completely negated by the fact that they invited a girl who appears to have literally given you PTSD.", "NTA", "NTA. She wanted you to feel pressured to accept her apology. Really manipulative.", "NTA it was suppose to be a happy thing,  not dredge up horrible feelings day", "NTA. Sam showed up at your birthday because it was an great opportunity to make you look bad. Basically, another way to bully you.\n\nWhoever invited her isn't your friend and is contributing to your bullying.", "NTA OP. Maybe your friends from uni need an explanation but if anyone gives you grief after that, they aren\u2019t your friends.", "NTA.  Sam is lucky you just left without slapping her face off.  Also: your friends are not your friends, they\u2019re Sam\u2019s friends.  Lose them.", "Nta although if you met your friends in uni, they may not have grasped how bad it was. I do think you should have given them the opportunity to ask her to leave.  On 1 hand i feel the apology shouldn't have been so public but on the other hand, if you wrong someone publicly, than apologizing the same way is only right", "NTA- Sam was truly sorry she would have done it in private, not putting on a show to garnish sympathy or attention", "They set you up. Nobody gets to force you to into a situation where you have to face someone who deliberately tormented you for years or make the decision that you over whether you forgive them. If they had wanted their planning to result in a happy event then they wouldn't have invited the honored guest's former abuser to it. Their choices triggered a post-traumatic stress response in you. NTA.", "NTA. As someone who was bullied for 3 years in elementary school I would probably have done the same. But seriously. What did they think would happen?! Did they just expect butterflies and flowers and all to be forgiven and everyone be happy? LMFAO! That\u2019s not how it works! Sam made 2.5 years of your life hell. She doesn\u2019t deserve a lick of forgiveness from you. Your friends suck and you might want to list off all the shit she did to you to those who don\u2019t know the history between you both. If they still expect you to be a doormat and apologize you might want to find new friends.", "It was dumb of your friends to do that, but it seems like an honest mistake.  It is a shame your hurt caused you to miss your own surprise party.  A better decision would have been to pull one of your friends aside and have them ask her to leave.  There is no need for you to accept Sam's apology, but you need to acknowledge the effort your friends put into making, what they thought, would be a nice party for you.", "OP\n\nABSOLUTELY ALL OF THIS. An apology isn't meant to be convenient for the aggressor, it's meant to be meaningful and at a time of convenience to the victim (strong word but it's difficult to find the right one to replace it without minimizing the effects of a bully and the trauma of *being* bullied.)\n\nThis was, in every way, inappropriate on Sam's part. As for the friends calling you ungrateful? Your reaction should have said *EVERYTHING* and should have made it obvious to them that they messed up. \n\nNTA", "Sometimes being the bad guy/girl/person is great, this was one of those times. NTA OP, and Happy Birthday!", "Honestly I was even thinking of comparing it to proposals at weddings -- something often done by *extremely* manipulative people to force their desired outcome. Because if you say no, it's worse than just saying no to a public proposal. You're literally ruining someone's big day. \n\nIt's just that the big day happened to be OP's instead.", "Smells like an ambush to me. \u201cHere is a chance to treat you like shit, jokingly of course, in front of all your new friends.\u201d \n\nShe had two and a half years to apologize. Instead she reached out to people who didn\u2019t know the history hoping for the chance to poison a fresh well of friendship for OP. And it worked. \n\nOP didn\u2019t handle it well but she is definitely NTA.", "If OP's friends really need a bully like Sam as a leader to follow, then they're not worth much, they're just Sam's new flying monkeys.", "Sam has a new group of flying monkeys to do her bidding.", "It\u2019s like finding out at the altar that your groom slipped \u2018and obey\u2019 into your vows.", ">  some people who attended told me they won\u2019t talk to me until i apologize\n\nWTF, tell those people to fk off, who do they think they are demanding you apologize to that person. If they mean them then fk them too for not understanding what happened.", "The worse part is that they brought your high school bully to your home (hope they never get jobs working for the Witness Protection Agency) - *thanks for taking away my privacy and safe space guys* \ud83d\ude44", "\"*When a toxic person can no longer control you, he will try to control how others see you. The misinformation is unfair, but stay above it, trust that other people are smart enough to see the truth.*\"  \n\n\nSam is still Sam, and the folks that are ignoring you for standing up for yourself are her new minions.", "Isn't that ironic. Bullies ignoring you or won't talk to you until you succumb to their bully tactics to apologize to your bully. Who needs enemies with friends like that?", "Oh, he was bullied by her friends and you go in bully her more. There is no point in your response. Have some empathy.", "You\u2019re not \u201ca very sensitive person\u201d, you were re-traumatised by seeing someone that has historically brought you great harm. Your reaction was perfectly acceptable given the scenario. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe Sam the opportunity to apologise and I don\u2019t think it will bring you closure. It\u2019s for her to feel better about herself and get forgiveness, I doubt she will offer any explanation that can help mitigate the pain she has caused you. Her wanting to attend your birthday and make it about her is evidence that she does not care about you, and is only seeking out an outcome that makes her feel better about herself.\n\nIf any of your friends can\u2019t understand your response at the party and are acting like you are in the wrong they simply are not your friends and do not have your best interests at heart. At least this situation has presented you with an opportunity to work out which of these friends are worthy of your friendship, the others aren\u2019t worth your time.\n\nHappy birthday, put yourself first and make sure to be kind to yourself. Don\u2019t let anyone guilt you into doing something you are uncomfortable with \ud83e\udde1", "I didn\u2019t realize you meant phone number at first and was wondering why OP would need such a personal detail like her PH balance.", "Agreed. NTA. My first thought was also \u201cway to make it about yourself\u201d. You don\u2019t hijack someone\u2019s party to apologize. This was a performance. A true apology doesn\u2019t a) require an audience or b) interrupt a special occasion to traumatize the guest of honor.", "NTA.  You had a trauma response.  The right thing to do was get to a place of safety-- which was any place where your bully wasn't.", "[removed]", "I could see OP staying if the bully had the presence of mind to leave, but there is no way OP should have been forced to have an uncomfortable confrontation sprung upon them at their own party. If the bully has changed, they should be able to see that the best option would be leaving when they are unwelcome.", "All your friends who participated in this bullying event need to apologize to you. Stand your ground on this.", "\"some people who attended told me they won\u2019t talk to me until i apologize\"  \n\n\nGood riddens to bad rubbish!!", ">some people who attended told me they won\u2019t talk to me until i apologize\n\nYou need to just cut those people out entirely, they don't care AT ALL about what you went through or your side of the situation. You deserve people who give you the type of respect you give them; and based on all this, you care far more for most of them and their feelings than they do about you unfortunately...", "Well, the poor thing had these hopes and dreams of glory, and then she got sandbagged and humiliated in front of everybody. I wonder if it hurt her feelings and destroyed her dignity? And is there a downside? lol!", "Iam really sorry that happened to you. I\u2019m glad some of your friends apologized to you. You don\u2019t owe anybody an apology. I wish you the best in life.", "unfortunately seems like the cat's out the bag on that by now so. much as it may suck, you do need to have a conversation to get some kind of explanation - or you won't know which of your friends actually have your back, and they won't know how badly they betrayed your trust.\n\ni'm sure your bully didn't tell them they physically harmed you when weaseling in on this. anyone who sticks by their actions after finding that out is a person you'll be well-served to ditch by the wayside.", "So they didn't know? \n\nIs there a reason you decided to punish yourself and leave your birthday instead of just telling her to leave? You have the right to storm out, but you can also make the choice to love your life instead of giving all that power to that random bully. Sounds like you're setting yourself up for a miserable future if it's more important to you to be this emotional than it is to have friends who throw surprise parties for you. They'll definitely never do that again after this.\n\nI'm leaning Y T A because I'm very unclear about why you're mad at anyone other than Sam and why you decided to leave with zero attempt to just make her leave first. You should know that dramatically storming out would obviously tarnish your reputation and make some people angry. Most people are seeking that reaction when they storm out.", "I doubt it was even about Sam\u2019s conscience.  Sam just found a brand new way to mess with OP, that\u2019s all this was"]}
