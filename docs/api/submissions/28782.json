We occupy the bigger one of the bedrooms and sublet the other one. Since July, we have had a new roommate 20F, a university student, I'll call her Emma. I admit I don't particularly like Emma. I treat her fairly and try to not let it affect my interactions with her, but this could be my blind spot in this whole situation.\n\nAnyway since mid September, I've had a temporary work placement in a town which is over 3 hours from us by car. Because of the distance, I'm also accommodated on the premises, which is covered by the employer. I come back on Friday evening and then go back again on Sunday evening. The work here should continue until the end of October, then I'll be back to my regular employment. \n\nTo be honest, I feel quite lonely. There's nothing here to do outside of work, the work is frustrating because I'm getting horrible support from my home company and get all the blame from the people here for things that go wrong or slow. Getting home to my girlfriend is the only bright spot of my week. I'm only mentioning this because I think it's relevant.\n\nAnyway, Emma asked us if her mom can visit her for a few days, starting tomorrow. We told her that if it's just a few days, it's not a problem. However, then Emma approached my girlfriend and asked her to ask me if I could not come home this weekend. Apparently, Emma grew up in a pretty conservative household and her mom wouldn't be happy to learn that Emma shared an apartment with a man. Also, she would be definitely super uncomfortable with hearing me and my girlfriend have sex or just see us be affectionate.\n\nMy girlfriend told her that she doesn't think that's reasonable, but that Emma should ask me personally. So she did and I told her that this is my apartment too and that I also don't think her request is reasonable. It's no problem for us to have sex when Emma and her mom are out in the city but I disagree with not coming home at all. Also, if having a male roommate was such an issue for her, she should have found a different apartment.\n\nEmma originally accepted it, but I think that with her mom's arrival approaching, she changed her mind. She has been texting me since yesterday that I'm gonna get her into trouble and that it's just one weekend. I had a call with my girlfriend and she said that Emma seems really on edge and is lashing out and we maybe could let her have this weekend to keep the peace. However, we've finally decided to stick to our normal routine. It's the 21st century, Emma's mother should keep up. \n\nDoes this make us the assholes?", "created_utc": 1697137442, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/176eojl/aita_for_not_caring_about_making_my_roommates/", "score": 760, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
