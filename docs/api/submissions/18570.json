She has just shown a side of herself that should be a concerning red flag for multiple reasons. \n\nFirstly, you should point out that she willingly chose to start a relationship with a dog owner. You didn't get thr dog after meeting her, and it's not even a case of having a covid dog like so many people that have now surrendered them.\nThat's not ok either, but my point is you've been a responsible solid owner for many, many years, so this part of you has been a package deal since day 1.\n\nAsk her very directly what she thought would happen when the relationship progressed, and don't let her avoid the question, change the subject, try to turn it back on you, etc. This answer is important. \n\nFrom the very beginning, has she always assumed that if your relationship progressed, you would obviously give up the dog because she doesn't want it?\n\nHas the idea of the dog ultimately sharing the same home with you together never crossed her mind? \n\nIf so, that should give you a moments pause. How well has she really thought anything out if the biggest issue, the living being, has never been considered. \nIt tells you that you probably need to have several more very in depth discussions now, before you take the next step. \nIe kids, finances, housing, what happens when yoh have to deal with negative situations etc.\n\nIs this the first time during your relationship that she has mentioned the dog, or dogs in general, and her thoughts on living with one? \n\nIe has she previously been of the mindset that she doesn't dislike your dog, but she could never live with one type of deal? Or has she quite happily been friendly with the dog and given no hint she would not be ok sharing the same home.\n\nIf she has never mentioned this before, or never considered what would happen if....then I hope you can explain that dogs are not something you throw away when it's no longer convenient. That it's a lifelong obligation, and she knew up front you came with a dog. \nI truly hope it's not any kind of problem, and once you've pointed out the issue, she sees this is not something that is up for negotiation.\n\nWhile people dislike comparing children to dogs, for this situation, it's actually fitting. \nThey are both beings that are fully dependent on us to care for all their needs, keep them safe, housed, etc. \n\nSimply ask her, what would you do when our (hypothetical) child becomes a toddler and they are so messy, leaving toys all over, filthy hands and food everywhere, drawing on the walls, etc.? \n\nThat's not much far off a dogs fur needing to be vacuumed or swept up, even if it is daily. I imagine you'll be the one cleaning up the yard after the dog, the primary dog walker, feeder, bather, etc. So it's really not putting anything on her. \n\nSure, there are compromises about things like whether or not the dog can sit on the couches/beds (depending on what he does now and if she has indicated it shouldn't. If it's been to her house, etc), but whether or not the dog is present at all is not a compromise.", "NTA!!!!! I could never be with someone so ready to abandon their pet.

When their finances got bad and they were suddenly working 12 and 16 hour shifts to get by?\n\nTheir dog spent 13 to 18 hours a day locked in a crate, got let out for a couple hours in the evening to be hosed down and dried off, slept with them (unless the poor thing kept them awake), and then went back in the crate for the next long day of work.

There are plenty of reasons.", "I know this isn't really related, but i swear if we took our cat away from its current environment, he would die. He's an extremely friendly outdoor/indoor cat and he's friendly with all our neighbors. He sleeps and eats in at least 5 different houses, he's really loved by everyone and he especially fits in with our neighbors across the street because they have a small farm. He really loves chasing chickens and rabbits and chilling with their dog. We already decided that if we would ever move, we would probably leave him behind because otherwise we would break his heart. We love him so much, he's the sweetest, but leaving him behind would probably be best for him.", "Yeah, a person should choose to be homeless before they give up their pet... /s\n\nThere are plenty of completely valid reasons to need to rehome a pet, like having to move ad not being able to find someplace that will accept the pet.", "Same here.

He adopted a labradoodle that a coworker of his had for about a year.  Apparently previous owners had done next to nothing in the training department and my friend is an experienced dog owner.  Dog took to training pretty well actually but his other dog was uneasy with how boisterous he was and in spite of my friend's best efforts it wasn't working out.  He contacted the breeder (which is what the previous owners should have done) and they connected him with a potential candidate for a new home.\n\nHe felt terrible and wanted to make really, *really* sure that the dog was not rehomed again so he disclosed everything, the good and the bad, and they set up a trial period. The new family had no other dogs and small-ish kid (kindergarten maybe?) who was kind of nervous about labradoodle's size.  That dog *thrived* in his new home. With no other dog the boisterousness and demands for attention were gone practically overnight.  Last I heard he was the new sleeping companion of the kid that was originally nervous.\n\nAll this to say is that sometimes there is not a good fit between dog and household and never will be.

You should ALWAYS pet an animal before you adopt it.  If you adopt it and then are allergic it is still your responsibility to take care of that animal.  If it came on after you got the pet, then it\u2019s very unlikely to be deadly and there are allergy shots and other allergy medications to deal with the symptoms.
