Heed the warning.", "NTA. Back in my single days I never dated anyone with cats single I'm severely allergic. A few times friends suggested I did then push them to get rid of their cat  if things got serious but I never did. A person should never expect a serious relationship with someone if they do not like or cannot live with their pet.", "NTA. I\u2019m of the belief that if you commit to a pet you need to stick with them, there is no excuse valid enough to give up a pet. Not a new apartment, not a new job, not a new partner.", "NTA.  You and she may not be compatible.\n\nWhen I got together with  my now-fianc\u00e9e I knew that the dogs and cat were part of the package.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019d choose my pets too if were given that type of ultimatum", "NTA  Why does she seem to care more about the neigbors' feelings than yours?", "NTA, you\u2019re incompatible, time to move along.", "NTA- no, you were clear that you and the dog are a package deal and told her before you moved in.", "NTA. Shit, I'd choose my dog over my husband and we've been married for 20 years.", "NTA  \n\n\nif she doesn't want you as a dog lover time to find someone who will accept you dog and all", "NTA.\n\nYou've had the dog for 7 years, and your gf expects you to basically abandon it by giving it to someone else?!? Nope. Your dog would be absolutely devastated, and you would be unhappy and resent your gf.\n\nI'd consider that to be a red flag. The barking maybe, if the dog barks a lot and the apartment has thin walls, but not the dog hair - that just goes with having a dog.", "NTA. Her issues are mere inconveniences, but what she\u2019s asking you to do to accommodate them is a disproportionately large sacrifice.", "NTA. Anyone who doesn't understand that my pets are my family, isn't welcome to join my family.", "NTA  \n\n\nShe knew the deal when she started to date you, you have a dog.  \nYou're a package deal.", "NTA.  Anyone who would not assume after 7 years with the dog that you and the dog are a package deal is really not for a dog person... so prolly not really a good person for you. Unfortunately, you're prolly best moving on.", "NTA", "NTA. I'm assuming she doesn't have any allergies. A pet is a family member, and she can't just expect you to dump him. Dump her instead", "NTA\n\nPets are family. If she can\u2019t at least attempt to live with your doggo, she\u2019s not the one.", "NTA - NEVER the AH for choosing your pet over your partner! The pet won't understand. You need to dump the uncaring partner and find someone with some compassion.", "Nta -  anyome should have known that if you ever move in with a partner, any pets they own would be coming with. If this is something they don\u2019t want to deal with, don\u2019t date someone with the pet(s) you dislike.", "NTA.

Your dog is one of your best buddies. Making you lose your dog is off limits. I get that she might not love dog hair in her home, but being in a relationship is about making compromises. You could come up with a cleaning schedule that might make this less of a problem if that helps. Else if you always plan on having a dog and she doesn\u2019t want one at all then your lifestyles are just incompatible.", "NTA . Why would she expect your dog not to come that you had before her? .my husband knew when we got together that dogs will be in our home.

You're supposed to be **at** that next level before doing this.

People who are \"pet people\" KNOW that pets are PART of the package when getting together with someone.  People who are NOT \"pet people\" don't understand the deep emotional attachments we form with pets.  Non \"pet people\" I think look at a pet more like an \"accessory\", which it absolutely is not, it is without a doubt a living and breathing  FAMILY MEMBER with a personality and specific needs.  \n\nI don't think gf is being an ah here, she's just not a \"pet person\" and that's okay too.  Sometimes you can convert a non pet person into being a pet person, sometimes you can't.  That's when it starts becoming a compatibility issue and sometimes it just doesn't work out.", "NTA. Who is she kidding, chicks shed and bark too. \n\nJokes aside (not really a joke), there\u2019s no chance in hell I would ditch my dog like that for someone.

I'm a clean freak, it takes a little more work to clean the house while living with a pet, but it's worth it. I would wonder if I want to continue a relationship with that kind of person if I were you.\n\nYou probably had your dog before you even met her, the audacity !", "NTA at all. You are responsible for the dog. For the rest of his life. Don't punish him for something he hasn't done. You aren't even living with this woman yet. She isn't your partner yet. She is just a girlfriend. I am sure the dog has been in your life for longer than your gf has been in your life. Your dog > your gf in this case.", "NTA\n\nFor starters, that really isn't the choice. You three could absolutely live together. And maybe you just summarized for the title, but I hate it when people phrase things that way. Really she is the one making the choice here: she doesn't want to have dog hair. That is a perfectly valid choice. No judgment (OK may some judgment). But it is still her choice, not yours.\n\nI cannot imagine life without a dog. I consider intolerance of dogs a dealbreaker. After a few weeks of dating, an old girlfriend told me that she *hates* dogs. She actually used the word hate. At the time I had two dogs, which she knew. I told her that meant our relationship was going nowhere. She actually was surprised. She asked me why. I felt like saying something like \"hello duh you seriously don't know\" but instead I politely explained that I would not get rid of my dogs for her or anyone else.\n\nAgain, everyone has their opinions and dealbreakers. She is entitled to not want to live with a dog. But if I were in your shoes, I would not move in with her.", "NTA", "NTA and good for you for siding with your sweet boi, pets are family too. The only time I\u2019d ever consider siding against the pet would be if it had a history of aggression and attacking people.", "NTA and lose the bird.  She\u2019s not the one and never trust someone who doesn\u2019t like your dog.", "Uh yeah. NTA. My most recent Ex tried the same shit. She also said she should come before my kids. She said having my kids and having a girlfriend is like \u201chaving your cake and eating it\u201d. Craaay cray.", "NTA. You chose right. You had the dog first.", "NTA\n\nPeople that don\u2019t understand pets are family can be hard to deal with. I get so many weird comments when people find out I have an in-door cat even though I\u2019m allergic. I love animals, and I love my cat I\u2019ve had for 10 years.\n\nAre there compromises you could make? You\u2019ll agree to vacuum as often as needed and get your good boi groomed and bathed often as well?\n\nFor the barking, does he bark a lot and bother your current neighbors? If not, why would this change? \n\nWhy not do a trial run and stay over for a few days with the good boi and see what happens?", "NTA, looks like you arent moving in bud.", "If you get married,  you are also marrying step-kids and pets.", "NTA. If my partner had a dog, I would be SO happy. On the other end of that, if my partner couldn't accept my cat, it would be over. I can't imagine ever leaving her behind, no matter who it's for. I had to go on a trip for over a week, and she was miserable without me(so I'm told), and I've only had her for a year. I can't imagine the emotional distress it would cause your pet of 7 years.", "NTA.", "Nope. My dogs and me are a package deal. When i read stuff like this i literally always wonder why pets are never discussed prior to these things. I mean i can see how you wouldn\u2019t know it\u2019s a problem but she sure did.

She knew damn well you had a dog from the start and just figured you would give it up for her. She has no care for the dog that you love and that says a lot.\n\nI met a girl when I was dating and she was nice enough, but then told me after like our 3rd date that I needed to give up my two dogs as I bought them with my ex wife.

It was very hard, but he wasn't a good fit for my family.  After we took him to behavior classes (we failed), sent him to a reputable trainer for 6 months of training (which he failed), and brought a reputable trainer to our house to help him socialize with our other dogs (which failed), I had to rehome him because he chewed up two of my other dogs to the point of surgical intervention.", "Paper tiger.  GF knew he had a dog from go.  Assuming he would prioritize her over it was hubris.  People who think of animals as less important than getting laid are flying huge \ud83d\udea9that should not be ignored.   Why did you feel the need to try to derail with a non-sequitor?

I am not a pet person, no part of me ever wants to live with a dog. If I were ever interested in someone who already owns a dog, that's a pretty clear indication that:\n\n1. I will eventually be faced with living with said dog \n2. He will most likely want another dog in the future \n\nSo I just don't date people with dogs.\n\nI would never dream of dating someone with a dog and then demanding they choose me over the dog. Wtf. The dog was there first?"]}
