{"id": 38, "submission_id": "10bm3wn", "title": "AITA for buying my wife a bouquet of \"filler flowers\"?", "selftext": "My wife (married for 7 years) has been going through a rough time, but lately (due to some impressive effort on her side) things seems to be going better for her. I wanted to show how proud I am of her, and decided to come home with a bouquet and a bottle of wine.\n\nI think roses and tulips are a bit too clich\u00e9, so I picked the ones I thought were the nicest: a bouquet of carnations.\n\nWhen I surprised her at home, she first got very excited. But when she saw the flowers, she said under her breath \"of course you picked *those* flowers\". I asked her what she meant by that, and she said it was just a reference that I wouldn't understand.\n\nI left it at that, but it kept bugging me, so later that evening I asked her what she had meant by it. She said it was a reference to the TV-show Sex and the City, where apparently carnations are described as \"filler flowers\", and the main character ends up dumping her date after receiving such boring flowers. She then went on saying that even though she understood that I was trying to be nice, she couldn't hide the fact that she was also disappointed about how little I seemed to know her and her flower preference (which ofc happened to be roses and tulips, d'oh) after having been married for so long.\n\nI feel she is being unappreciative when I was trying to do something nice, and that she could have saved her \"tips\" for another time. But if I simply should have known better or have  crossed some social etiquette that I am not aware of, I guess I am the AH.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEDIT: I see several people commenting that they think I chose carnations because they were cheaper. However, they had both roses and tulips there for the same price. I know nothing about flowers, so I just picked the ones that I thought looked the nicest.

She gets relationship advice from sex and the city? I don't remember that show that well but weren't most of those characters single all the time or actively sabotaging their relationships?", "There\u2019s a saying \u201cit\u2019s the thought that counts\u201d. Your wife is way off. Carnations are not \u201cfiller flowers\u201d (I\u2019m in the floral industry) they are a focal flower. However, they are the cheapest focal flower you can purchase-I think that is why SITC gave it that moniker. Red roses could be cliche-but there are other colors. There are hundreds of different types of flowers-lillies, orchids, etc if you want to buy something different.  I\u2019m not defending her, but knowing her favorite flower would work in your favor in the romance dept.\ud83d\ude09 NTA", "I won't judge but yeah, after seven years of marriage you should know her favorite flower OR smb you may ask for advise. In my country carnations are placed on tombs, that's all I have to say.", "I\u2019m really torn. On the one hand, flowers of any kind are a nice gesture, and objectively carnations can be pretty in an arrangement. On the other hand\u2026my local McDonald\u2019s has carnations on the tables \u2014 not roses or tulips. I assume that\u2019s because they are cheap and sturdy.\n\nDue to her response, \u201cof course you picked *those* flowers,\u201d I\u2019m going to guess that she has expressed her preference before, which makes me lean towards a gentle YTA for not listening/paying attention to your wife over the years (that said, I\u2019m not necessarily excusing her blunt delivery - but would you really have preferred to her lie??). Keep in mind, that doesn\u2019t mean I think the flowers were a horrible idea or anything; I just think the execution was a bit misguided (and you put your preferences ahead of hers).\n\nJust because you think roses and tulips are \u201ca bit too clich\u00e9\u201d doesn\u2019t mean *she* feels that way. Furthermore, I would argue that carnations are the most cliche flower of all, and they always make me thing of high school dances. That might just be my experience. And hey, she might have had a bad experience with a high school boyfriend who gave her the most hideous carnation bouquet or something along those lines.\n\nHave you asked her?? What has happened with past flower gifts? I would absolutely love it if my partner asked me about my preferences, whether that\u2019s for flowers or for vacation spots. Some people may want to go to the Caribbean. Others may way to go to Europe. Neither preference is inherently wrong. Just like there are cat people and dog people. Different strokes for different folks.\n\nOne of my pet peeves is the concept of the golden rule: treat others how you\u2019d like to be treated. This is horribly flawed imho. I prefer the **platinum rule: treat others how *they* want to be treated.** Those two things are quite often not the same thing. \u201cBeware the trap of you\u2019d self-centric thinking.\u201d (I\u2019d recommend Google for more info because I\u2019m probably not doing it justice here)\n\nI get it\u2026carnations are cheap and roses aren\u2019t. Also, guys don\u2019t exactly learn about flowers in school. But there are so many other types of flowers out there. If you need help, ask your female family members or coworkers, or even a friend\u2019s wife. You can even google this info, ask people on Reddit, or ask the florist. I saw gorgeous flowers of all sorts at Costco the other day. You do NOT have to spend a lot of money to have beautiful flowers she\u2019ll love.\n\nI would guess that she\u2019d prefer a single rose over a bouquet of carnations. Maybe she doesn\u2019t like roses either. Maybe she doesn\u2019t like cut flowers at all and would prefer a potted orchid that may bloom many times over the years. You can get those for about $20 USD in most grocery stores and Home Depot. Maybe she\u2019d like a tiny succulent instead.\n\nI can tell you love your wife and didn\u2019t mean any harm with the carnations - but she\u2019s entitled to her own opinions. She shouldn\u2019t be forced to like carnations just because you gave them to her. This should be an easy fix :-)\n\nPS: As a veterinarian, I feel compelled to remind everyone that many plants/flowers are toxic to pets, even those you may have in your home or yard. So please keep that in mind! For example, avoid lilies like the plague if you have cats!!\n\nEdit: apparently I sped-read the last couple of paragraphs about her preferences, and how she seemed mainly disappointed that you didn\u2019t remember her preferences. She didn\u2019t need to save her \u201ctips\u201d for another time. You asked her; that was the time! *Please*, OP, **listen**.", "Carnations are one of my mom\u2019s favorite flowers, so this definitely isn\u2019t a societal standard.\n\nHaving said that, you\u2019ve been married for 7 years and didn\u2019t know what kind of flowers she likes?

But when she saw the flowers, she said under her breath \"of course you picked *those* flowers\". I asked her what she meant by that, and she said it was just a reference that I wouldn't understand.\n\nI left it at that, but it kept bugging me, so later that evening I asked her what she had meant by it. She said it was a reference to the TV-show Sex and the City, where apparently carnations are described as \"filler flowers\", and the main character ends up dumping her date after receiving such boring flowers. She then went on saying that even though she understood that I was trying to be nice, she couldn't hide the fact that she was also disappointed about how little I seemed to know her and her flower preference (which ofc happened to be roses and tulips, d'oh) after having been married for so long.\n\nI feel she is being unappreciative when I was trying to do something nice, and that she could have saved her \"tips\" for another time.

When those aren\u2019t in season I\u2019m definitely not too snobby for a nice grocery store bouquet. My tried and true advice to anyone buying flowers is; \u201cWhen in doubt go for fewer flowers of a higher quality than cheap but large.\u201d Almost everyone prefers a thoughtfully arranged bouquet to a giant $9.99 wrap of carnations. It\u2019s just like buying any treat most people would rather be gifted a single cookie/bon bon/ slice from a fancy store than a whole bag of oreos/kisses/grocery store sheet cake.", "I've always found that the carnations go first and then the roses, and then the rest die slowly. I love tiger lilies (I even have one tattooed on me) and those things take forever to die.", "They've been married 7 years.  There's been birthdays, a WEDDING, valentines day, you don't think the topic has ever come up?  Even if she didn't outright state \"BY THE WAY MY FAVOURITE FLOWER IS ROSES\" an observant partner could probably notice what flowers she gravitates to or admires.\n\nAnd no, it was absolutely HIS preference to get her carnations.  He specifically states that he thinks tulips and roses are cliched and thus he did not choose them.  I feel bad for your partner, it seems like you're too dense to pick up even the slightest clue about their preferences.", "If nothing else, now he knows. Should she have made that initial comment? Maybe not. But from what OP said, she\u2019d been going through it pretty bad for a while. It may have just slipped out. \n\nBut OP *also* says that he picked the flowers that *he* felt were the nicest, that *he* felt roses and tulips were \u201ctoo cliche.\u201d Not one thought about what *she* would like. When the thought behind a gift is \u201cyou should be happy that I did anything,\u201d I guess I don\u2019t feel like it means much.", "Because they are flowers, which are seasonal and perishable. And most people like flowers in general. It\u2019s not a binary gift choice.", "Is she supposed to be able control her feelings? OP says she was exited at first. She was disappointed when she saw that the flowers weren\u2019t the ones she likes. Can you control when something disappoints you? I wish I could control not being disappointed by people.", "This is sweet. It's nice to do something for someone else because you know that it has value to them and makes them happy regardless of how you personally feel about the gift. My bf refuses to buy me flowers (he does other thoughtful things) because he thinks they are a waste. I love them. It makes me sad that he won't do something so simple that would make me really happy", "My wife doesn't like flowers either - at least cut ones. She would much prefer a plant because she can keep it alive. She knows cutting flowers doesn't always kill a plant btw but they die quite fast once cut so.. plants or something else are a good gift for her.", ">I am not unique. It's not just me\n\nI never said that. But you can acknowledge that not everyone is just like you, right? \n\n>hope that most people would not be rude to their s.o.\n\nThat's where the wife went wrong. She was rude and she's an asshole for that. \n\n\n>You say thank you. End of story\n\nIf you give someone a gift they don't like, you should expect to be corrected. Especially if it's your wife of 7 years. I don't think it's ridiculous to expect a partner to know a kind of basic preference. This goes for any other gift. If someone I've been with for a better part of a decade gives me silver jewelry when I only wear gold, I'm going to say thank you and be grateful for the gesture but I'm also going to be hurt they don't know me well enough.", "omg i love that and am stealing it. \n\n  \nTotally agree re: oakiness \ud83e\udd22. there is a nice italian restaurant near me that has a house white that is a chardonnay (blend? not sure) that the servers always describe as \"but it doesn't taste like chardonnay!\"- it's really not bad at all and I will order it by the glass if i'm in for lunch or something casual. \n\n  \nover the holidays my bf and i were at a friend's houses (family i used to nanny for) and the mom only drinks chardonnay. I wasn't drinking at all bc i was under the weather, but she was pouring him glass after glass of chard. when we left he was like \"omg idk what was with that wine but it was disgusting, i've never tasted a wine so bad!\" i was like \"congratulations, you've had your first chardonnay experience\". i don't think he will make that mistake again haha", "He bought the flowers but without thinking about what his wife wanted, and she was the one that would receive them. \n\nFor example, your SO buys ice cream for you, but it's a flavour you don't like and can't eat it or you don't even like ice cream. You would still appreciate the gesture but it feels disappointing. If you want to do something for someone to be appreciated you should buy things that they appreciate.", "\u201cThe work\u201d is paying attention to what the wife likes, or finding out by asking her or someone else. Like you said, as it is would be \u2018just buying shit\u2019; the difficult part is listening to someone talk about their likes/dislikes and remembering it, and using that information later on to pick out a good gift.", "The fact that she made reference to an unrealistic TV show about what the flowers are proves she isn't.", "If someone went out of their way to get me something just because I'd be grateful yes lol. If it was a special occasion that's a different story.", "There are lots of people in my country who hate carnations because this flower was massively used during communist celebrations and every women used to receive them on Mother's Day. I, however, am not that old to remember so I personally have nothing against them. \ud83d\ude04", "I specifically wanted carnations in my wedding flowers because I am Portuguese so they\u2019re a symbol of the end of a 40 year dictatorship to me. But I still didn\u2019t want bright red ones (the actual symbol of the revolution) so I got (natural) dark purple ones.", "I believe in Italy, carnations are the flowers you give for condolences. I think carnations are really pretty, especially the variegated ones, and the deep pinks.", "I have no strong feelings about any flowers, but I see carnations as pretty, fluffy little upside-down tutus. Also, any resemblance to the tissue paper flowers I got from my child for mother's day is a bonus.\n\nThat is good bouquet-buying advice!", "I have been with my partner way longer and not once have I told him what flowers I want in a bouquet. It's such an unimportant topic. Are flowers like the most important thing you can talk to your husband about? And who gets a gift and says \"ewww tulips...I want roses\"? That's so disrespectful. If there are no allergies or smells she can't take then every flower is pretty. He found pretty flowers and gave them to her for no other reason than making her smile. And btw flowers aren't a must for women at every opportunity that ever existed. I guess I would be more upset that my partner thinks he has to get me boring flowers just because I have a vagina and some lazy dude at some point thought \"jewelry and flowers at whatever event and a woman can't complain\" \ud83d\ude05", ">My bf refuses to buy me flowers (he does other thoughtful things) because he thinks they are a waste. I love them. It makes me sad that he won't do something so simple that would make me really happy\n\nI hope you at least buy yourself flowers instead of going without just because your boyfriend is selfish on this point! If they make you smile then it's worth doing.", "I think it's pretty weird to never eat cake unless it's carrot cake. Just sayin.", "hmm i guess. that just seems normal. It feels like he might just be viewing things differently. To him flowers may just be flowers and he didnt know his wife actually cared about a specific type. At least thts me trying to see a possible reason for this.", "How so? It seems to me she's just using a reference to express her feelings, I see nothing wrong with that.", "I think that\u2019s the way it goes everywhere. My mom always used to say; \u201cEverything old is new again!\u201d", "I didn\u2019t even think to mention that! In lots of cases carnations are used in funeral arrangements and grave blankets giving people a fairly traumatic association.", "It was obviously an important topic to OP's wife, given how disappointed she was that he didn't know her preferences after 7 years of marriage.  He found flowers HE preferred and gave them to her expecting to be praised and lauded for his thoughtfulness and then had to contend with the fact that he really didn't think much about her wishes at all.", "I do! And I was just telling him about this thread and he goes \"your favorite flower is ranunculus right??\" so at least he has been listening LOL", "i get that, but it's kinda part of it that you know what your loved on cares about even if you don't. *'It's important to them so it's important to you'* kind of thing. \n\nFor example, I have a good friend who loves the color green. When I buy stuff for him, I always try to find it in a green shade. *I* don't care what color my stuff is, but he's got a preference, so I keep that in mind when I get things for him. \n\nThere's always gonna be stuff in a relationship that's important to one person and isn't to the other, small or big. You can't just only pay attention to it when it's important to you, or else you'll end up losing them [because you didn't bother to put away the dishes.](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/she-divorced-me-i-left-dishes-by-the-sink_b_9055288)  Just food for thought.", "Lol if you don't see how thinking something from Sex in the City shouldn't be reference then I don't know what to tell you. We're all different so maybe you believe it's real lol. Don't care either way. Stay blessed."]}
