You would also be totally justified in having totally separate finances.", "NTA. But I would move the money somewhere safe. A separate account only you have access to for savings, emergencies, maybe a fixed deposit account with low risk and return, at least it\u2019s something, whatever version your country has. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve done all that and the money, while still accessible, would not be worth it to withdraw small amounts, which you would only do it in case of emergency. Tell your husband how much you received and what you did with it and from now on this will be where your extra money is going because that\u2019s what YOU need to feel secure and what you need and makes you happy. \n\nListen to what he says and tell him it\u2019s final. You will contribute to the house, bills and extras as usual but your saving / emergency fund is non negotiable. \n\nBe firm, be understanding and willing to explain how you feel and why, take control of your finances and do what YOU want to do with YOUR money\n\nMy husband is the same, I have a much bigger savings / emergency fund than him, but he would never dream of reaching into my pockets for his fun / hobby money. Whatever personal money he has after bills, is his to use on that kind of stuff no questions asked. If we dip into our joint account for inconsequential amounts it\u2019s whatever. But anything big needs to be discussed and mutually agreed on. \n\nI\u2019m the one that initiated this setup because I cannot not have an emergency fund and I prioritize that over fun money. There is no hiding, lying or beating around the bush in this house.", "Good luck on that much needed talk actually accomplishing anything long term. It just kills people like that to see a dollar saved rather than in their paying off the bottomless pit of their reoccurring bills.  \n\nWe had decent jobs, but years of my spendthrift partner coming up with/or manufacturing 'emergencies' that kept our savings floating between 1k to 5k max.\n\nWe still have that tiny joint savings account that they constantly want to draw down... and I have put my extra money in a private account they don't know about. It is currently passing 40k. (Admittedly, not much considering, but I was starting from a financial pit I had to dig out of.)\n\nSometimes, despite wanting to be open with your spouse, you just have to learn to keep your mouth shut. \n\nNTA \n\nBut you really need to learn not to tempt him with too much financial good news.", "yeah, i am glad you didn\u2019t listen to kids\u2019 advice about real world problem bc i definitely think YTA if you withhold information about money in a household.  imagine if he does the same to you, etc.", "NTA Your money.", "Hard no YTA , hiding money is not the answer.", "I understand that. Honestly this is the first time I have every thought of doing something like this, but it's like every time we get extra money (above and beyond our paychecks) he wants to spend it on his hobby or the next big toy (like a motorcycle or something)", "For the most part we are. It's just anytime we get \"extra money\" (like bonuses and tax returns) he wants to spend it on something instead of saving it or paying off something we already have.", "I have. His usual rebuttal is that it makes him happy", "Well keeping finances separate is already a loss. We combined finances when we got married. We both (with our paychecks) contribute evenly to bills.", "Lol. I love this comment.", "I have thought about going to a financial advisor but just haven't done it.

I guess kinda a mix? I am the only one that has really gotten windfalls as he doesn't really get bonuses. But I have always used the money for us. Either a vacation or paying something off or buying something new for us", "This is the first time I have ever thought of doing this. We share finances evenly for our paychecks. He just doesn't get large bonuses like I do.", "I don't think I'm justified. That's why I asked. I have never done anything like this so I am asking for guidance.", "This is spot on of why I asked the question. I have talked to him about not spending money but it's an uphill battle. He will say things like spending money makes him happy and that he doesn't get the same happiness from paying something off (because it's not new I guess?)", "This is why I asked. I was thinking it's wrong to hide money but it's so annoying to have to tell him over and over that just because we got some money doesn't mean he can go buy things. \n\nI haven't ever lied to him about anything (outside of normal things like gifts and surprises) so I think the guilt would kill me or make me tell him so I probably won't end up doing it anyways.", "Tbh, I\u2019d argue that he shouldn\u2019t be frivolously spending YOUR money on his expensive hobbies. This seems to be a pattern of his and it isn\u2019t fair to you. He can use his own money to buy those things and leave yours alone.", "Set a \u201cfun money\u201d budget for each of you. Each month you get X amount and then like 10 % of any windfall or bonus money. You can each spend fun money however you like, but all joint money needs to be allocated jointly. No expensive toys or hobbies for just 1 person.", "Well, and it makes you happy if he doesn\u2019t. So why does his happiness win?", "Tell him it makes you happy to be debt-free", "It may make him happy now, but is it going to be worth it when he has to work past age 65 because you didn't save enough for retirement? Or if he has to work part time even after retirement to make sure the bills get paid?", "You can split it up again now. You\u2019re not locked in. \n\nI am so very serious. My ex husband wrecked me financially when we had joint acct and I had to split things up or we were constantly at risk of not being able to make payments. If he saw money in the acct, he spent it.", "I would suggest separating them if your discussions are not successful. Put money in a combined account for bills, food etc. Then you can do what you want with the rest, you can save money, and he can spend what he has left. Maybe then he will learn the importance of saving some money for emergencies, holidays etc when he doesn't have your extra money to spend all the time too.", "But it makes me happy to know that we have an emergency fund to cover...emergencies. It causes too much anxiety and it makes me obsess over what will happen if. I need x amount of money in an emergency fund to feel safe. My safety and ability to cover emergencies is more important than you having a shiny new toy.", "It is past time that you sat down and had the serious financial talk.  You can\u2019t make any kinds of financial plans until you figure out your goals and what\u2019s important to you!  You both need to take at least 15 minutes apart to think about and write down what your financial priorities are, including where you want to be financially in 5 years and in 10 years.  \n\nWhen you don\u2019t have any plans or goals, it\u2019s easy and fun to blow your money in the moment.  \u201cJust spend less\u201d rarely works and rarely makes people happy, because it\u2019s harder to see why you should when it doesn\u2019t have a purpose.\n\nIt seriously blows my mind that you got married without doing this.  Financial conflicts are one of the top 3 reasons for divorce.  I can\u2019t imagine getting married without figuring out if your goals and philosophies about money are at least compatible, if not entirely the same.", "Then why are you paying all the bills?", "I don't think it would be a bad idea to get it, pay off the bill you have planned for it, then frame it as a \"surprise\" of having paid it off.", "OK, in that case you would be more of an AH to deliberately go behind his back. You have an issue that hasn\u2019t been resolved. It *needs* to be resolved - get what help you need to do it, but do it. You aren\u2019t going to solve it by going behind his back. That will just undermine trust and whatever you have built up together. Rarely will be the case that being dishonest with an intimate partner doesn\u2019t make you an AH. This is not an exception. You need honesty. I don\u2019t care if you tell him, discuss it, and end up saying \u201cit\u2019s my bonus, and this is what is happening with it\u201d but at least you\u2019re being honest with him.", "This idea may not work for you but it worked for us. We also set down and made a list of what constitutes an emergency. My emergency fund could only be used for things on the list or other extreme instances (roof leak, car breaks down, emergency room visit, etc). I don\u2019t remember what the list was. At time has gone on and our finances have changed the emergency fund amount has changed. Now we have reached a point where we can both be on the emergency fund. It sounds like you need a heart to heart or a come to Jesus meeting. You need savings to feel safe and secure. He wants shiny toys. Your need for safety is more important and he needs to realize that. He needs to step up and help you feel safe and secure", "I honestly never thought of it this way. I guess I always saw it as \"house money\"?", "Wow. I NEVER thought about it that way.", "Sounds like we were married to the same guy.  I well remember the hissy fit he pitched when I had enough of that and opened a separate checking account in my name only, but I had to know that the bills would be paid.  When we parted (and wasn't it inevitable that we would?), I discovered that I should've also taken my name off our joint account because he managed to destroy my credit by mismanaging that account.  Took me years to recover financially from that.\n\nOP, I urge you to think seriously about separating your finances for your own protection.  NTA.", "Poorly worded. I am in charge of our finances.", "Be honest with yourself. Would *he* see it as \u201chouse money\u201d if you bought an expensive you-only item with *his* bonus?", "It sounds like you need a joint account for house/shared expenses, and to keep the rest of your paychecks in separate accounts so he can't blow through the money you're making on shit y'all don't need. \n\nIt also sounds like you need to put your foot down with him and have both of you depositing money into a savings account neither of you touch without consulting the other.  Not having a safety net is a huge deal, if something happens, you'll be screwed just so he could have a motorcycle.", "Crazy right?\n\nI think some people put pressure on themselves to make others happy. He\u2019s apparently tapped into that and is using it as a mechanism to get *his way* in something that should actually be an adult discussion - like a budget. \n\n\u201cBut it makes me happy\u201d is actually a terrible reason is both ways can\u2019t coexist because he\u2019s choosing his happiness over yours.\n\nThe best compromise is when everyone is a little unhappy (but everyone wins!)", "Also, when you have extra money, does it ever go to something frivolous that you want, or your hobbies? Or just his?", "Ohhh got it. There\u2019s still an issue if you\u2019re worried about him spending your bonus frivolously though", "Gentle YWBTAH but good on you for the mature outcome you have reached.", "Nah, OP does need to take accountability. Call the guy out and be honest, even if it is a confrontation. That's what being an adult spouse means."]}
