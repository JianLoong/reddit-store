It\u2019s a horrifically sad situation overall.\n\nA few weeks back, we intervened due to the fact we learnt that Nanny hadn\u2019t had a wash or bath in over 4 months and was admitted to hospital due to various infections caused basically by faecal matter entering the urethra.\n\nWe also found out at the same time that she is eating one meal a day and her Son and Daughter have basically said \u201cThat\u2019s her problem\u201d and refused help her. We started trying to put a schedule in place so a family member (Split among 6 adults) would visit her twice a day, to ensure she was eating at least two meals and give her medications. As I said, split among 6 of us its hardly that onerous.\n\nNannys son and daughter absolutely erupted. They turned up screaming that we were awful people, that we want her money for ourselves (neither of us are mentioned in her will). While this is ongoing, my wife was an absolute mess.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the situation, it was them angry.

I\u2019m not, in anyway, stopping or limiting her time with her family.

Your inlaws are worse than toxic. Offer to help get your partner therapy if she feels the need for it.\n\nKeep an eye out on whether she engages in similar behaviors with your own children.

Of course, get Nanny out of there as quickly as possible. \n\nI don't know how recently she started treatment, but one thing I will mention is that many elderly people experience quick-onset dementia when they have a UTI, which it sounds like Nanny did. Get her medically cleared then have her see a neurologist ASAP. You might be able to get some of her function back. \n\nI wish you best of luck. There's a special circle of hell for people who abuse children and the elderly.

I am sure there is respite care and other things available, plus they can appoint a guardian if needed. \n\nI'm so sorry you're going through this. Sick relatives and wills bring out the absolute worst in some people.", "NTA this happened within my own family when my great grandmother was very ill. My nanny and 2 of her brothers were left caring for their mother (my nanny was recovering from her 2nd cancer and was also far too sick to be doing this) and due to other various feuds between the rest of their siblings it quickly turned into an absolute mess. My great grandmother passed away 3 months ago and the other siblings were allowed nowhere near her funeral nor left anything in her will. \n\nHonestly I can\u2019t blame you for taking yourself out of the situation. You\u2019ve tried and tried to help but they don\u2019t want anyone else involved. So long as you don\u2019t prevent your wife from still being involved you are NTA just make sure to be there for her when it inevitably goes tits up", "NTA \n\nbut you can Charge the in laws with Eldery Abuse, I think. The grandmother(?) has dementia and has been awfully neglected. She needs a new primary caretaker or even a conservatorship. It would be better if someone, who cares about her, gets the rights than the Inlaws or someone who is a stranger.", "NTA. You should consider putting Nanny in assisted living because I would not trust them to care for her for any length of time. She\u2019d be safe and you won\u2019t have to worry about them being abusive when you aren\u2019t there. \n\nI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be against it because it will likely deplete her estate, so you may have to get a lawyer involved. Reporting them for elder abuse might be a good idea. Based on them mentioning the money, I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if they have little interest in keeping her alive. She\u2019s probably not mentally competent enough to change her will, so their accusation that you are trying to get her money is absurd.", "NTA\n\nPlease get her the help she needs.  That's just awful that they let it get that bad.  It's even worse that they are angry about it.  These are toxic people and you're better off without them in your lives.  \n\nI'm so sorry you're going through that.  Please don't question something you know is true.  Don't let them out that doubt in your head.", "My laws [Honey badgers as well!!](https://youtu.be/bskDDjCjNVQ)", "NTA please report them to social services. If they want her money instead of using it for a nursing home or to hire care givers & someone to provide meals they are committing elder abuse.", "NTA.  Protect your immediate family.  Get social services involved and have granny moved to a care center away from these abusive people", "NTA - I'm so sorry this has happened.  What your in-laws are doing is criminal, and should be treated as such.  Can you contact the police and request a welfare check on Nanny?", "\u039d\u03a4\u0391 \u039d\u03a4\u0391 \u039d\u03a4\u0391 \u039d\u03a4\u0391 \u039d\u03a4\u0391 \u039d\u03a4\u0391 \u039d\u03a4\u0391 \u0391 trillion times and good on you for being a decent human being to your  wifes nanny.\n\nYour inlaws are a pair of toxic garbage that mutated to a human form", "This!  And it will get neither better nor easier. Granny just can't take care of herself anymore and never will again.\n\nI had to watch my mother slowly dying of Alzheimer's over the course of 3 years and it was absolutely horrifying sometimes, when she would scream and rage (seemingly) without a cause, because of what she saw in her head. \n\nNTA OP, but very considerate to split the care between the adults, as to not have one person housebound with Gran. Even if the others don't see it that way (yet).", "I am amazed that adult protective services wasn't called when grandmother was in the hospital. She should not have been released with a plan for her care at home. OP should totally call APS or the equivalent in their country. Let the government deal with the toxic relatives.", "Nta. Please call adult protective services or the council on aging. Police wellness. Get the authorities involved.\n\nIt's elder abuse to leave her like that. Take care.", "I fully agree, I also don\u2019t want them anywhere near me", "I\u2019ve contacted our local safeguarding of vulnerable adults (SOVA) team today and they are going to investigate.

Considering we all live within 10 minutes of her house it\u2019s hardly a chore", "I\u2019ve never encountered the term Nanny outside of meaning a form of childcare.

These folks are toxic. \n\nThat said, it sounds like Nanny really needs to be in assisted living, preferably in a place that has a wing for dementia patients. Even with the responsibility of looking after her split among six adults, I doubt anyone is really equipped to deal with her specific needs. It would be better to divide visiting her in a home with staff who can make sure she\u2019s getting the care she deserves.", "Thanks! I had a Granny myself, but never heard of Nanny. \n\nYou are definitely NTA in this scenario. Best of luck!", "I don't want to be that person, but I would try to be in the room with Wife when they call her if possible. If she's pressured easily or caves to her family, she might give SOVA a different story than the one you told them."]}
