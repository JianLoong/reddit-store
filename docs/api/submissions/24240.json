Is he? Because if so, you need to have an understanding that someone on the spectrum may need frequent clarifications and reassurance about going places or making any change to the routine. They may feel anxiety about the event and need you to go through it with them.\n\nAlso, they may become hyper-fixated on something near you. \n\nFor example, my cousin on the spectrum would often ask silly questions like \"is that shirt red? is it a red shirt? That's a red shirt, right? it's red?\" and we'd need to tell him \"yes, it's red\" many times before he would move on.\n\nWhile annoying, your partner may just need that sort of communication if he is on the spectrum.", "NTA, but honestly seems to be more of a generational difference.  My parents/older friends are exactly like OP\u2019s partner.", "I know a couple of people like that, I just find them annoying but doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a bad person or a red flag", "Firstly this is not acceptable behavior from someone who is 55 and I personally would not be putting up with that kind of shenanigans. He is a grown man and should not need you to answer every question that pops into his head. You are not his mother or his manager.\n\nSaying all that as you have said that you want to try and continue this relationship the first thing I thought was that being as generous as possible he does potentially have some autistic traits. I am autistic and could recount a lot of times people have shouted at me because I have not picked up on their nonverbal cues and subtle hinting. For me I simply do not see or understand this stuff so their shouting at me is completely out of the blue and honestly can be really upsetting. Imagine that someone had been whispering instructions to you in a language you don't speak in a crowded bar and then just had a go at you because you weren't following those instructions. It's kinda like that for me sometimes.\n\nSo I would suggest a couple of things that, if this is him genuinely not recognising what is going on and not just being an arsehole, you could try. First sit down at a time when you are both chill and talk about how exhausting and anxiety provoking it is for you when he expects you to know everything and answer all his questions. Be really clear, no hinting or nonverbal stuff, just say the words. Second when he starts doing this stuff just say really clearly \"I can't answer all these questions right now, can we discuss this in a bit when I have finished eating (or whatever)\"", "NTA, he\u2019s behaving very badly. Run", "He massively over reacted and was repeatedly rude. That said, I would encourage you to say something directly (not subtle hints) at a much earlier stage when you aren\u2019t so wound up that you end up shouting at each other. \n\nIf you had calmly said that you were trying to eat and wanted to focus on your food instead of answering questions - and he still had the same reaction - easy N T A. \n\nIt sounds like this is about much more than a one off bombardment of questions and you could both do with figuring out how you deal with the root of your resentment and how to communicate better with each other.", "\" My partner has a habit of asking a series of very insistent questions which is anxiety provoking for me\". That is a huge red flag. Why are you with him? NTA. You need to reconsider the relationship", "NTA-let him keep walking.", "Wow.. what the h...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe's so much an asshole. What are you even doing with that guy. Are you his employed secretary? Were you on the clock when this incident occured?", "NTA leave his bum ass, if you treat your partner like this you deserve to be alone.

Do you always just answer his incessant questions? If yes he\u2019s probably got so used to just asking you that he no longer bothers to think / remember for himself. Try pushing back on him and making him do it subtly \u201chmm not sure how long/far it is between activities can you look it up\u201d or \u201cI haven\u2019t confirmed x can you find out\u201d etc etc. He\u2019ll either share the load or stop asking, I\u2019d take it as a win either way ha", "Thank you!  Exactly.  If someone needs to apologize it\u2019s him right?\n\nHere\u2019s the rest of the story:\nI finished my meal in peace, ordered dessert, paid the bill and when I left the restaurant I found him  parked outside with his headlights on and the driver seat pulled back so he was lounging.  I got into the car, turned off the AC because I was cold and said \u201cI\u2019m cold and I want to go home.\u201d  He responded with \u201cWho cares?\u201d And seemed to be on the verge of rehashing/ demanding an apology.  So, I got out of the car and started walking home.  It was going to be a 30 minute walk uphill.  Ten minutes into the walk he caught up with me in the car and demanded repeatedly that I get in the car.  I was boiling with rage at this point and responded with \u201cpark the car, get out of the car and apologize to me ON YOUR FUCKING KNEES\u201d and when he refused I said \u201cThen fuck off.  I never want to see you again\u201d.  He followed me with the car demanding that I get in the car but I stuck to my guns and finally he apologized and responded to \u201cWhat are you sorry for?\u201d With \u201cI am sorry that I left you.\u201d So I got in the car and he drove us home in silence.", "OP i just got out of an extremely toxic relationship with someone older than me who started out very kind and mature. then he slowly drive me insane.\n\nthe man in your post, his behavior is childish and tone-deaf. get out while the attachment isn\u2019t strong. save yourself the depression and confusion.", "Good point, I expected someone to point out the age gap.

However, I could definitely do a better job communicating what kinds of things bother me or give me anxiety and maybe instead of responding with \u201cI don\u2019t fucking know!\u201d I could try simply explaining that the questions are giving me anxiety and I need him to help me remain calm by putting the rest of the questions on the back-burner while we enjoy the rest of the dinner.", "My first thought was \"is he autistic?\" My brother is and this sounds like something he would do.", "Thank you for your thoughtful response!\n\nInterestingly enough, I have ADHD.  My partner is a  physician and he has a lot of experience with mental health and neurodevelopmental differences. I am a speech therapist and so I also work with various children with ASD and other neurodevelopmental conditions.  We\u2019ve had this discussion before and my partner has explained that CPTSD can present like ASD.  Although I was genuinely trying to communicate my perspective, I\u2019m sure he picked up on the ASD red flag and felt attacked and insulted.  Maybe I am the AH after all. \ud83d\ude2c", "Fair point and no, I have never explained that the questions give me anxiety.

I really appreciate this feedback.  I don\u2019t know if he has autism and probably never will as he does not identify as such and is more qualified than I will ever be to give that diagnosis.  However, I can see that he was genuinely hurt and upset and it was certainly not my intention to make him feel that way.  So I may need to implement the strategies that you\u2019ve suggested in order to help us communicate.", "So, why are you with him?

People get frustrated, people fight, they say things they don't mean--but take a step back and really think about how insane this whole interaction was.

I do have to admit that my partner\u2019s knowledge of many many details is also quite helpful on a regular basis."]}
