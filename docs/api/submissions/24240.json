Is he? Because if so, you need to have an understanding that someone on the spectrum may need frequent clarifications and reassurance about going places or making any change to the routine. They may feel anxiety about the event and need you to go through it with them.\n\nAlso, they may become hyper-fixated on something near you. \n\nFor example, my cousin on the spectrum would often ask silly questions like \"is that shirt red? is it a red shirt? That's a red shirt, right? it's red?\" and we'd need to tell him \"yes, it's red\" many times before he would move on.\n\nWhile annoying, your partner may just need that sort of communication if he is on the spectrum.", "NTA, but honestly seems to be more of a generational difference.  My parents/older friends are exactly like OP\u2019s partner.", "I know a couple of people like that, I just find them annoying but doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a bad person or a red flag", "Firstly this is not acceptable behavior from someone who is 55 and I personally would not be putting up with that kind of shenanigans. He is a grown man and should not need you to answer every question that pops into his head. You are not his mother or his manager.\n\nSaying all that as you have said that you want to try and continue this relationship the first thing I thought was that being as generous as possible he does potentially have some autistic traits. I am autistic and could recount a lot of times people have shouted at me because I have not picked up on their nonverbal cues and subtle hinting. For me I simply do not see or understand this stuff so their shouting at me is completely out of the blue and honestly can be really upsetting. Imagine that someone had been whispering instructions to you in a language you don't speak in a crowded bar and then just had a go at you because you weren't following those instructions. It's kinda like that for me sometimes.\n\nSo I would suggest a couple of things that, if this is him genuinely not recognising what is going on and not just being an arsehole, you could try. First sit down at a time when you are both chill and talk about how exhausting and anxiety provoking it is for you when he expects you to know everything and answer all his questions. Be really clear, no hinting or nonverbal stuff, just say the words. Second when he starts doing this stuff just say really clearly \"I can't answer all these questions right now, can we discuss this in a bit when I have finished eating (or whatever)\"", "NTA, he\u2019s behaving very badly. Run", "He massively over reacted and was repeatedly rude. That said, I would encourage you to say something directly (not subtle hints) at a much earlier stage when you aren\u2019t so wound up that you end up shouting at each other. \n\nIf you had calmly said that you were trying to eat and wanted to focus on your food instead of answering questions - and he still had the same reaction - easy N T A. \n\nIt sounds like this is about much more than a one off bombardment of questions and you could both do with figuring out how you deal with the root of your resentment and how to communicate better with each other.", "\" My partner has a habit of asking a series of very insistent questions which is anxiety provoking for me\".

Exactly.  If someone needs to apologize it\u2019s him right?\n\nHere\u2019s the rest of the story:\nI finished my meal in peace, ordered dessert, paid the bill and when I left the restaurant I found him  parked outside with his headlights on and the driver seat pulled back so he was lounging.  I got into the car, turned off the AC because I was cold and said \u201cI\u2019m cold and I want to go home.\u201d  He responded with \u201cWho cares?\u201d And seemed to be on the verge of rehashing/ demanding an apology.  So, I got out of the car and started walking home.  It was going to be a 30 minute walk uphill.  Ten minutes into the walk he caught up with me in the car and demanded repeatedly that I get in the car.  I was boiling with rage at this point and responded with \u201cpark the car, get out of the car and apologize to me ON YOUR FUCKING KNEES\u201d and when he refused I said \u201cThen fuck off.  I never want to see you again\u201d.  He followed me with the car demanding that I get in the car but I stuck to my guns and finally he apologized and responded to \u201cWhat are you sorry for?\u201d With \u201cI am sorry that I left you.\u201d So I got in the car and he drove us home in silence.", "OP i just got out of an extremely toxic relationship with someone older than me who started out very kind and mature. then he slowly drive me insane.\n\nthe man in your post, his behavior is childish and tone-deaf. get out while the attachment isn\u2019t strong. save yourself the depression and confusion.", "Good point, I expected someone to point out the age gap.

My partner is a  physician and he has a lot of experience with mental health and neurodevelopmental differences. I am a speech therapist and so I also work with various children with ASD and other neurodevelopmental conditions.  We\u2019ve had this discussion before and my partner has explained that CPTSD can present like ASD.
