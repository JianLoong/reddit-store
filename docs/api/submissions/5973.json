(I was supposed to get it for his birthday in September but I couldn\u2019t afford it at the time) my son was really happy he got his gift.\n\nThis past Monday, my sister and 8yr old nephew came over to spend a few hours with me, my son and my daughter, all was well until after they left we couldn\u2019t find the Nintendo, we search under the couches, behind every tv, opened every cabinet/drawer. Even under the fridge. I didn\u2019t think my nephew took it, the thought didn\u2019t even cross my mind. I didn\u2019t try ti get a new one with the warranty because the warranty doesn\u2019t cover loss/theft. I just figured it would pop up in the house eventually when we weren\u2019t looking for it. Earlier today I went to my sisters house to drop off some left over food I made from yesterday\u2019s dinner and I noticed as soon as I came walked through the door my nephew jumped off the couch and darted in his room and closed the door. Again didn\u2019t think anything of it, but I did decide to sit and talk to my sister for a bit.\n\nMy nephew came out of his room to use the restroom but left his room door open, (now they live in a small apartment so you can see his bed from where I was sitting on the couch)\nAnd low and behold I see a Nintendo Switch sitting on my nephews floor in front of his bed (the blue and red controllers gave it away) you can\u2019t miss it. I get off the couch to go pick it up and when I turned it on my log in account was on it, so I knew it was my son\u2019s (he\u2019s 5 yrs old so he uses his account under my name with parental control of course) I ask my sister why my son\u2019s nintendo was here and she acted as confused as I was, my nephew came out of the bathroom and he yelled \u201cno!! Give it back\u201d and snatched it out of my hands\u2026 this is where I may be the AH, I snatched it back from and told it wasn\u2019t his and you can\u2019t steal from people and he just started screaming and falling out kicking. When I snatched it back my sister was PISSED she started cursing me out and telling me snatch anything from her son\u2019s hands. I argued that it was my son\u2019s nintendo and She knew I was looking for it, my son never took it out of the house so there\u2019s no way it ended up at my sisters home across town on its own.\n\nThis woman had the audacity to TRY (she didn\u2019t but she tried) to snatch it back from me. It turned into a screaming match and I just walked out because it wasn\u2019t going anywhere but physical if I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s crazy because when I asked her why my sons Nintendo was there when I first found it she was as confused as me, so for her to switch up that fast because I snatched it back from my nephew is beyond me. I would understand if i snatched it too hard and he fell but he didn\u2019t fall from the snatch. He purposely fell from his trantrum. Yes he is 8 yrs old and still throw huge temper trantums. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672362277, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zymg5v/aita_for_snatching_my_sons_brand_new_nintendo/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
