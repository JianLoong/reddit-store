Went to go find it a couple of weeks later and couldn\u2019t find it anywhere, 10 months later found it in a box in my kids closet.", "NTA", "NTA\n\n The Narcissist's Prayer\n\nThat didn't happen.\n\nAnd if it did, it wasn't that bad.\n\nAnd if it was, that's not a big deal.\n\nAnd if it is, that's not my fault.\n\nAnd if it was, I didn't mean it.\n\nAnd if I did, you deserved it", "NTA but you know it was your sister who stole that switch right? Her son was playing it in their living room so she 100% took it and gave it to him.", "NTA. Your nephew took the switch, whether it was with his mother\u2019s help or not is the question. I am hard pressed to believe she didn\u2019t know he had it if he was playing with it on their couch. \n\nWhen things settle, maybe you can talk to your sister about it again\u2014in a neutral place that isn\u2019t your house or theirs\u2014and see if there\u2019s a way to move forward. But for the time being, I think she and your nephew need to stay away from your home.", "NTA\n\nHowever, I see the theft and the blowup over the snatching as two separate events. \n\nEver had another parent try to discipline or scold your kid at, say, the playground or a kid's event? Even if your kid was acting badly, the mama bear will come out in any parent if someone touches or scolds their kid -- or snatches something away from them. It's just not cool.  \n\nIf she appeared genuinely confused, give her the benefit of the doubt. She may not have known he had the toy or where it came from. Maybe he hid it from her. \n\nA better approach would have been to ask her to instruct the boy to give you the device. Then you could have shown her your log in and let HER ask HER KID why the game was in her house.", "NTA and your sister knew he had it.", "NTA. Your sister is a terrible mother.", "NTA - sister has to be in on it. I assume the nephew stole the switch sans dock. So how was he charging it?", "NTA. \nThey should not be allowed back in your home ever again. And if they are, there should be forced to remain in a specific barren area with nothing to steal.", "NTA. Your sister knew damn well her son had that thing. He was playing with it in the living room. She was complicit in his theft and then doubled down to try to keep it for him instead of having a normal, ashamed reaction.", "op=NTA\n\nBut your sister is--she knew her son didn't own a nintendo switch so it's BULL that she didn't know what had happened.  Plus as you pointed out, it had your account on it.\n\nWould not allow sister or her son in your home again.", "NTA tell her to kick rocks a few years down the line when she asked you to loan some bail money.", "I would cut WAY back on contact with your sister and her child.\n\nI definately wouldn't be letting them back into your house for a long, long time.", "NTA", "NTA. This will keep happening every time you let them in your home. She clearly isn't taking responsibility for her sons actions and most likely never will. If he steals so openly and knows to hide it, I'd say he might have learned it from her. She's probably a thief too. Don't allow access to your home anymore and I'd go NC.

Whether you snatched it, picked it up, or wrestled it from his grip is immaterial.  \n\nThe fact that she was trying to steal the switch from your hand to give back to get son is insane.  Was she trying to reward him for stealing the device and give it back to him?  A normal parent would have instantly punished their child.\n\nDon't allow these people back into your home.\n\nNTA", "NTA and your sister totally knew he had it. He was playing with it in front of her and she knew your son\u2019s was missing and knew she didn\u2019t buy this. She figured her kid deserved it more.", "Wtf??? Your sister has no conscience and her son is going to be just as bad. You\u2019re NTA and I\u2019m glad you found your son\u2019s game even if it was a sucky way to find it.", "If your sister tries to say you were wrong to take it from her son, just point out that you wouldn't have had to if she had already returned it to you. Also, don't let your nephew come over until he and mom both demonstrate that they have fixed the thief/enabler roles to child/parent.", "NTA OP\n\nA minimally attentive mother would know if their kid had a new gaming device in their house. Either she knew he had it or she has NO idea what he does with his time.", "Yeah OP tell your sister she\u2019s not welcome over anymore and neither is the nephew.  They\u2019re gonna steal more shit. \n\nAlso - OP, have you noticed anything else disappear in the past?  Think a little bit about that", "She took it. He was playing it in front of her and acted like it was his in front of his mom.", "OP found it in about five minutes cause the kid wasn't smart enough to shut his door to hide his crime.  No way his mom didn't notice earlier.", "No you\u2019re wrong she\u2019s not going to wish she held him accountable, she has 3 kids all boys, her oldest child is the same age as me 26 just a few months younger and has been in and out of jail since he was 13 for theft and burglary(currently in jail now for breaking into a home) and her middle son is 19 he\u2019s been working the same job since he was 15, stays out if trouble, doesn\u2019t steal, has a good head on his shoulders and has his own apartment with his high school sweetheart, you know the difference between her middle child and the other 2?\u2026. Her middle child NEVER lived with her, his paternal grandparents had custody of him from a young age. And his grandparents raised him RIGHT. I\u2019m convinced she taught her other 2 to do these things. There\u2019s no way the only child that never lived with her turned into a good young man with manners and a good head on his shoulders.", "He was playing the switch in the main room I doubt it was a surprise to the sister she was just a good actress in the moment. I don\u2019t think with as audacious as he was being that he was even trying to hide it from the sister, she was complicit I guarantee.", "The kid is a kid, not yet a thief. The sister is a thief, and not to be trusted. \n\nShe\u2019s done some parenting\u2026 teaching her kid how to steal. This kid is gonna be in for a bumpy ride for sure.", "And some growing up to do on her own.", "I am sure OP knows it too but doesn't want to admit it. I don't blame her, sometimes you think your family is different and they won't steal from you. Sadly, life is cruel bitch.", "Kid would have smashed it if he got it back", "I would have threatened to call the police. Maybe that would have shut her up. And honestly, calling the police might have been a good thing to scare the 8 year old thief.", "Because he saw an older nephew of mine with one last year and he let my son play with it, he\u2019s wanted one ever since, I planned to get it for his birthday but I couldn\u2019t afford at the time from bills and planning his party, so I got it for Christmas I got a warranty in case it breaks or get any type of damage", "Great catch!!", "He only took the switch, it takes a c-charger and my sister has an android that\u2019s how they were charging it", "No she took it. That\u2019s how this all makes sense", "> I\u2019m convinced she taught her other 2 to do these things.\n\nSeems very likely that she stole the Switch, not her youngest.", "Please don\u2019t let these people in your home again", "Given this, your nephew may not even have stolen it or realised it was stolen - his mother may well have taken it and told him it was a gift...", "Stop letting them in your home and taking anything valuable around them", "Mhmm, and I\u2019d bet money if she had just asked for it back the little monster would have thrown it to the ground during his tantrum", "It\u2019s not just a game. It\u2019s an entire fucking console.", "The sister stole it. She gave it to him and that\u2019s why he thinks it\u2019s his. He wasn\u2019t playing a game system in front of her that she didn\u2019t give to him (or ask about). She knew the switch was missing. She pretended she didn\u2019t know so she could blame her kid, who was upset because the system his mom gave him was snatched by his aunt, resulting in a predictable outburst so mom could freak out on sis and blame sis for handling it wrong.", "Or else she took it herself.", "Taking something from someone who it doesn't belong to, to return it to the proper owner, is not stealing in any way, both mom and the kid would have never mentioned it to op if he hadn't been there and seen it. They're thieves, nothing more, she knows who's it was and did not care. She'll be complaining about his behavior soon and will have no one to blame but herself.", "Apparently she already tried that per a comment from OP, first one is in their mid 20s in and out of jail for theft and robbery, second one was removed from her care as a young child and is an upstanding citizen, this is her THIRD child, and he's turning out just like the other one she \"raised\".", "Hm, yeah, most likely. Well he'll get his ass kicked one day.

You know this right?", "clever", "Are you accusing me of saying that OP shouldn't have acted like the little thief's father? Because that would surely be a foolish thing for anyone to say. Adult men should always assert their authority whenever they get the chance especially over a 3rd grader. 3rd graders need to learn right and wrong and if the mother isn't going to do it, the uncle should show alpha male dominance and use his power to correct his sister's child.\n\nIf sister had written this post and said she was upset that her brother didn't give her the chance to reprimand her son, everyone would have been talking about toxic masculinity.
