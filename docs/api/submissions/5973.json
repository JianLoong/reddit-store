I doubt she bothered to check anything, even if she did she\u2019s 42 and not very tech savy so she wouldn\u2019t even know how to remove the account. And if it wasn\u2019t for my gf helping me buy the Switch my son wouldn\u2019t have been able to get it for a few more weeks because I spent over $200 on gifts for this same nephew so he can have a decent Christmas since I knew she\u2019s having financial troubles. Just UNGRATEFUL", "Yes I am!! I already have cameras on the outside of every entrance. They better not come anywhere near my home", "Also, now reading your comments, it seems more and more likely that she is encouraging these acts, if not even going to the extent of doing them. To be honest, I'm a little confused why you had to ask Reddit. \ud83d\ude02 You're definitely NTA. No other way about it.", "How am I an irresponsible parent for buying my child a game he wanted since last year? Did you not read the part about parental control? Did you hear me say anything about my son playing the game all day long? (Considering he didn\u2019t even have it a full 24 hours before it was stolen) Screen time? You assume because I spent $400 on a system you know my parenting style? Ever heard of Big Brain Academy, ABC Mouse, my 5 yr old is VERY advanced for his age, he knew all of his abc\u2019s by the time he was going on 3 yrs old, he speaks properly AND clearly, he can read books to himself (he LOVES to read), he\u2019s been matching numbers, colors, images ect since he was 1 yrs old, he was fully potty trained at 2, completing large puzzles at 3. ALL while hearing his dad beat me up from the other room until I grew the balls to leave for me and MY child. You don\u2019t know sh!t about me or my child. You can say I\u2019m the AH all you want to, but you will not call me a bad parent for rewarded my son with a WELL deserved gift.", "NTA too, but I lolled really hard at 'dynamic duo'\n\nedit - Wombo Combo", "Your nephew was probably punished right after you left for not hiding the evidence of her crime better. That\u2019s how you train the good out of people; no good deed goes unpunished and bad ones are rewarded.\n\nYou need to remove this person from your life; they lost family status the moment they stole from you, and your child, for their own wants.", "NTA OP, but OMG why are you letting them into your house!? You need to go hard NC with your sister and her youngest and oldest. Middle one sounds okay.", "Then why let her into your home? Or expose your kid to the nephew that you very well know is gonna turn out like his oldest brother?", "Good point", "I think it's time to go No Contact.", "Nephew's Switch probably broke so the sister grabbed the new one", "Well now it\u2019s a precedent", "Unfortunately I think her greed overpowered whatever bond you might have had. Your sister has an issue with stealing and entitlement that is being passed onto her children. I doubt that 8 year old masterminded this and even if they did your sister had every opportunity to return it to you and she chose to fight you instead. Her actions today show who she really is. I wouldn't let her into my house anymore if I were you.", "Super ungrateful and a little thief to boot.\nYou can tell your kiddo gets the best from both you and your gf, and you're both great at how you handled the situation. \n\nAnd hey, whether she is tech savy or not doesn't matter, *she knew* her kid had something that didn't belong to him, and did nothing to fix it. I won't shit on your sisters parenting because I dont know her or what shes been through from a bar of soap, but **you** did the right thing, period. Thanks for replying OP! Best wishes for your new years! \n\n\n(I forgot to add NTA to my original comment and all it asks for is info, oop).", "Just ignore that arsehat, you seem like a good mum", "Video game systems just straight up aren't developmentally appropriate for a child that young. It's not about the content of the games, it's about brain development. Don't get mad at me \u2014 that's what the World Health Organization and  developmental researchers have found. Just because certain products are marketed aggressively towards young children doesn't make them appropriate for young children. Just because a child wants a product doesn't mean a child is actually ready for that product. You wouldn't let a first grader drink vodka even if he begged for it for a year, right?\n\nI said absolutely nothing about the rest of the way you parent or your parenting style in general \u2014 just that it's not good to give kids that young their own screen devices / video gaming systems. There are serious effects on frontal lobe development.\n\nGood on you for escaping a toxic situation. Seriously. Glad you both are doing so well.", "The sister most likely knew the moment they got home that first night it was lost and told him to hide it when auntie comes over \ud83d\ude44", "Plus, depending on how much he played it, wouldn\u2019t he have asked for a charger for it? (Unless he managed to grab that too.)", "That would also explain her kid's furious reaction. He probably had no idea it was the same one his cousin got. His mom probably told him \"look baby, I got you one too\". Why would a 5 year old doubt that?", "My daughter has one I am ashamed to say I have no idea what it does. She tried to show me how to do something on it once and I think I messed with the settings. Suffice it to say I am no longer allowed to touch her device \ud83d\ude36\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude29.", "> She gave it to him and that\u2019s why he thinks it\u2019s his.\n\nNope.  It's worse.  They BOTH knew it was stolen. \n\nThat's why he jumped off the couch and ran to the bedroom as soon as he saw his aunt.", "Much worse than that", "Oh I\u2019m sure there is one on the market. Kids these days are born with electronic devices it seems.  My sis teaches preschool, ages 3-4 and a couple 5s who missed the kindergarten cut off and one of her students has an iPhone 14, and a fancy iPad. He brought them to school one day and she had to call the parents to collect them as it was against the rules.", "Even an oblivious parent would have a difficult time not noticing a new expensive looking electronic that they definitely didn't buy for them.", "She 100% knew because she\u2019s the one that stole it or enabled it. It really doesn\u2019t come to an 8 year old to do that unless he\u2019s been conditioned to steal already. That\u2019s the error here - don\u2019t assume that the 8 year old did it. Assume the guilty party is actually OP\u2019s sister, the bad parent teaching her kid how to steal and hide it.", "You can charge them with a pixel cable", "Many years ago, back in the mid-80s, I had a neighbor who was not only a massive thief but was teaching her toddler children to steal. \n\nShe used to go shopping with them in strollers, and she'd stuff merchandise under and in their diapers. \nA few years later, she bought a lot of Mexican furniture on credit from the makers. Instead of paying off her debt, she called immigration and she had them deported.\n\nI have seldom met anyone more evil than her.", "It\u2019s no different than if they walked out of the house with a PS5", "I teach 7-8 year olds.  Believe me, they can absolutely steal.  Sometimes it\u2019s a one off and they learn from the consequence. If it\u2019s a constant problem, there is usually an underlying reason for it, but that can range from bad parenting to trauma to a compulsive disorder.  Some parents try hard to put an end to it, but it requires medical or psychological intervention.\n\nEditing because I just read OP\u2019s comments below about the family history.   In this case, yes, it seems he has been taught stealing is acceptable behaviour.", "No 8 years can and will steal on their own no matter if they were taught stealing was okay or not. Now the sister most likely stole it since 1) the kid was most likely playing in front of her and 2) she tried to snatch it back.", "USBC with power delivery, but there's apparently some problem with non-oem chargers bricking switches", "That\u2019s pure fucking evil bro I\u2019m all for coming here legally because that\u2019s the right thing but I ain\u2019t no snitch.", "i mean, even without going into ops comments, the fact that the childs mother obviously knew he stole the switch (the nephew couldn't keep it hidden from op for all of 30 minutes, no way in hell he could have kept it from his mom for days.) and at best just didn't care tells you all you need to know. \n\nheck, even if she somehow didn't know, (god knows how that might have worked, but lets play along) if i had seen this exact situation play out with one of my daughters there's no tantrum in the world she could throw that would keep me from pulling her up, putting her on the couch and starting to discuss what happened with my child before handing out an appropriate punishment. the fact that ops sister went off on op instead of helping her settle this situation before disciplining her child really says it all.", "Well, you're a dick whether you have one yourself or not."]}
