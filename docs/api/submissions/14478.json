I can't blame him for being upset. But if the little girl had never reached out, his life would have continued unchanged.

There is a case in my town where a three year old was taken from the adopted parents because the bio father had not known of her birth. He wanted her back and the court ruled in his favor. It was heartbreaking for the adopted parents and the little girl who had only known her adopted parents as her mom and dad. Your ex should have been told.", "Yta. You not only gave up your child - you have up his. Just like a father is responsible for a child that he helped create, he also has rights to that child. You unilaterally took those away.

She chose not to.", "I\u2019d say deciding for him that he didn\u2019t want to parent and giving his child away is a pretty clear YTA.", "And people saying OP is the AH are forgetting all the dangers and roadblocks that he could have put in her way. He could possibly have prevented the adoption, at a minimum, and she would have been stuck raising a child she could not parent.\n\nI understand why he was upset, though I think hours of yelling is not reasonable, especially since he wasn\u2019t upset about not knowing her, but not getting a head\u2019s up. So NAH has my vote. \n\nEdited for clarity.", "OP knew the girl COULD reach out. That's enough for YTA.", "In all 50 states, she could have dropped the newborn off at a safe haven, including a fire station!", "12 years not 18. They were 18 when the pregnancy happened.", "She\u2019s 12 not 18.", "Wtf? The onus is on him to, after every instance of having sex, check that the sex partner isn't pregnant?\n\nRather than just the pregnant woman telling him she's pregnant?\n\nThat's insane.", "Why? Should she have had an abortion instead? He would not have been entitled to know that!", "Your post is now voting for OP to be TA. Perhaps you can change it to NAH?", ">You have no idea how he would've reacted to finding out you were pregnant.\n\nIn no way is that a valid justification for not telling him.", "Then she would have been roped to him for 18 years. Given that choice, she would have been better off having an abortion!", "She\u2019s had 12 years to correct that mistake and tell him. She chose not to.", "Really, the one problem here is that since the child was born, DNA testing has become as easy and common as dirt and thus you got found out. I don't blame OP for not giving her ex a say because that could have made things worse, but technically once the sperm leaves the penis, the men don't get to make the decision.", "She did not need to inform him in the state where she gave birth. She did what was best for her and the baby. She could have had an abortion instead. She chose not to.", "I\u2019m from the US and I\u2019m PRETTY sure that all roads need to be exhausted first before an adoption process is considered legal if a parent or parents decide that they want to give up their child for various reasons.", "She could have had an abortion, which would also have taken away his shot at being a dad. She chose not to!", "How on earth is not telling the other parent that he was a father a NTA thing? He isn't psychic. How on earth would he know if she didn't know until after they broke up? She had the baby and took his parental rights away without telling him. Everyone knows you can easily access DNA tests now and the fact that she still didn't tell him makes her even more the AH.", "And? Why shouldn't he like know at all", "So he's an asshole for being upset that he was never informed he has a child?\n\nAlso, OP just said they broke up, not that he left her.", "Lol, it's on him to ask if she got pregnant, but not on her to tell him she did?\n\nThe fuck kind of logic is that?", "At 12/13 she\u2019s not old enough to do those tests. You have to be 18+ to do them.", "There are arguements that it should be necessary.\n\nIt runs down the same path of if woman has some rights to decide on abortion she has sole responsibility for resulting child.", "His knowledge and consent wasn't needed for this either. If she got an abortion she should have told him that as well. It's not about legality, it's about if she is the asshole, and she is.", "still \ud83d\ude2c", "So he could have forced her to parent the child? And run off himself?", "Right. Thank you for the correction, and I'll edit accordingly.", "She could have, yes.\n\nThe difference is that an abortion is about making decisions about her own health and how she'll allow her own body to be used. Adults who are mentally competent should always have the right to make their own medical decisions without requiring consent from others.\n\nAn adoption is about a child that is now an entirely separate body, that has no direct medical implications for anybody. It's not covered by the right to make medical decisions for yourself.", "You can't not tell the kids father that he has a kid just because it might make your life harder, lol", "She's not asking for legal advice, she's asking if she made an assholish decision.", "She's not asking for legal advice, she's asking if she made an assholish decision.", "You could legally do that, yes. Society allows for that because, bluntly speaking, the alternative is that more babies get tossed in dumpsters.\n\nNot terribly relevant here, though.", "Oh shoot, I misread that. I\u2019ll edit my comment.", "Having an a portion is completely different than having a whole person pop up a few years later to let you know that you\u2019re a biological parent.

An aborted fetus can't come back into his life like this adopted child did.", "It absolutely is. Since this guy is/was a \"party animal\" he likely wouldn't have wanted to raise the kid anyways. He's just mad in the aftermath because he realized she didn't rust him.", "She could have just signed her parental rights away since she didn\u2019t want the baby. He didn\u2019t even get the chance to love or want his daughter until she was gone. YTA OP.", "How would she been roped to him for 18 years. She could have signed her rights away if the father wanted to step up the same way she did for the adoption. Your logic makes no sense.", "Correct what mistake?  There was no mistake made.", "I don't blame her either. I just understand why he is upset. He had a right to know, but I understand why she chose not to tell him.", "Really?\n\nThis comment seems really foolish, because once the sperm leaves the penis, men also have responsibilities which means they should have some decision making ability as well. Unless you're going to say men have no responsibility once the sperm is out, then it does not seem reasonable or fair to say they have no decisions. It just seems ridiculous\n\nIt may be legal, but it is not moral to hide a pregnancy from a parent. He may not have wanted any responsibility. But he certainly deserved the opportunity to decide that. I'm unclear on how anything else could be considered right. And if her daughter ever did come looking for her, what was she going to tell her? Don't call your dad? I don't know who he is? What was she going to say? She had an open adoption, so she knew her daughter could contact her. What was she going to say about the dad?\n\n This could lead to real resentment from her daughter and is given the dad the built-in excuse. He didn't even know she existed", "How does she know that though? She doesn't know if he would have chosen to parent or not. Plenty of people decide to make drastic lifestyle changes when expecting a child. The kid also should have been able to know who her biological father was, especially if she had access to someone who could have just told her at any time.", "He should have been given the opportunity to raise the child.  But he wasn\u2019t. This baby had two parents. She acted unilaterally. It would. It have changed anything if he had been informed and wanted to take custody of the child.", "She certainly has the right but that doesnt it so. She absolutely robbed him of the chance to be her father, even if he was wild back then that doesnt mean he would have been a bad father.", "Actually, all 50 states have safe haven laws where a mom can give up a newborn who is under 3 days old. Those laws were enacted to encourage women to give birth instead of having abortions.", "Yeah, it's the \"mom\" vs \"mum\" and \"college\" vs \"university\" etc that make me feel that this is the case.  I don't know how this would be legal.", "So what? She didn't choose that.", "That literally has nothing to with the situation? Thats not what she did.", "But she didn't and his flesh and blood is walking around. He had a right to know.", "i feel describing the mechanics of how babies are made and how they require 2 people would get my post moderated so feel free to do your own research", "No reason he should know. There is a reason all 50 states allow a mother to give up a newborn. Safe Haven laws ensure a mother who can't care for an infant can give up the child without retaliation. Her state allowed a standard adoption without going to that extreme.", "I never said he was the AH. I said she is NTA! There is a difference.\n\nOt makes no difference why they broke up. It happened before she knew she was pregnant, so it is irrelevant.", "The same way kids aren\u2019t supposed to have Facebook or Instagram. They just change their birth date and do it. Unfortunately they still do it they\u2019re at home tests.", "No, she is not. He doesn't own her. He doesn't own her body. He doesn't own the child that came out of her body.\n\nDoes he have the right to be upset? Of course. That changes nothing.", "I disagree with you completely.", "Lol, no it isn't. People can change - and having a kid is a pretty big reason to change.\n\nEven if he didn't want to raise this kid, it's still his kid. Unless OP thinks telling him about the kid will put her/the kid in danger, there is absolutely no justification for keeping him from his child.", "Then he should have worn a cap in the shower!", "The mistake was not telling her ex that he is a father, duh", "There are reasons why all states have Safe Haven Laws and why some states allow adoptions without the notification of the sperm donor. She gave birth to the child and in the state where she resided, she had every right to give the newborn up for adoption.", "But she didn\u2019t go the safe haven route\u2026.she went the adoption route. Two completely legal different ways. The question at hand is: did she exhaust all the legal routes to make sure that her ex was aware of her putting the child up for adoption? And the answer is no. The next question is: did the law system ask her \u201cdo you know who the father is?\u201d And if she answered \u201cno\u201d but she knew (since she is aware of who the father is), is it TRULY a legal adoption?", "1 reason he should know, he might have kept the child instead of her growing up without either bio parent.", "So your entire reason is soley based on just the law", "The response should be \n\nNAH if you feel both aren\u2019t assholes. \n\nNTA - means she\u2019s not an asshole but the other party is. \n\nESH  - both parties are assholes. \n\nIn this case she is a massive asshole for not telling him he also has a child out there. It\u2019s her choice to go the adoption road , but she should\u2019ve informed him she was pregnant.", "Uhh, no there isn't. Saying one party in a two party situation is NTA is the same thing as saying the other person is YTA.\n\nIf neither person is the asshole, the judgement you want is NAH.", "\"Does he have the right to be upset? Of course.\"\n\nThat's literally what's up for debate lol. She obviously has no legal obligation to tell him, which is just a fact. She should have though, as it is the right thing to do. Nobody said he owns her or that he owns the child, and that's a weird leap to make.", "He is the child's father. He has as much right to know his child exists as she does.", "This response makes no sense in the context of the comment you\u2019re replying to. You\u2019re all over this thread behaving very bizarrely. Are you even a real person?", "I think safe haven law is an amazing thing. \n\nHowever in all states require the father to be notified and give consent. The only way you get around this is to lie. Op is she lives in the US had to lie and say she didn\u2019t know who he was or that she feared for her safety to get around notifying him. If she did this then the adoption is a fraud. He can have the adoption thrown out. He can sue op for fraud. Even if she says she wasn\u2019t a 100 percent sure who the father was given the fact they had a relationship would have been enough to  test paternity and need his consent.\n\nHe could sue op. He could possibly get the adoption over turned. Op has made one hell of a mess because she unilaterally decided to do this.", "In the state where she lived, she took a legal option open to her. As she stated, the consent of the father was not required to place her newborn up for adoption.  She did NOT need his consent!", "I already changed it to NAH.\n\nThere are many legitimate reasons women do not inform the man who impregnated them they are pregnant. She lived in a state where she could give the newborn up for adoption without his knowledge without using the alternative available in all 50 states, which was to use the Safe Haven Law and drop the baby of at a Fire/Police Station or Medical Facility! Those laws exist for a reason.", "I will change that.", "No, he doesn't. Plus, it would be kind of difficult for her to not know the existence of the child!", "Like the previous poster said if she lied which I am pretty sure she had to lie and say she was either in danger or didn\u2019t know who the father was. Because in the US in all states require fathers consent unless the father is unknown or is a threat to the mother!\n\n\nIf she lied and the ex can prove it he can overturn the adoption because the adoption happened under fraud. If this can be proven then I am pretty sure that op can be in trouble.\n\nAnd I have some serious doubt about the father being a party animal if there was only 2 options on who the mother is!", "Well, by doing that you're halfway there in my opinion, hah.\n\nBut I still think OP absolutely is an asshole for not telling the kids father - which is directly related to the adoption situation, since she could only adopt the kid out without his permission due to the fact that she never told him about the kid in the first place."]}
