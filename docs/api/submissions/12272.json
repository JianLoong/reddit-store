It sounds to me like he is used to living off of his parents and possibly you were at some point as well. The difference being that you want to get away from that and earn your own money and he sounds like he is totally okay with this lifestyle without earning it. It sounds like what you did was very nice and if he cant appreciate that than he may be in the wrong relationship. There is no reason why he shouldn't support you in your decision to be independent. \n\nThat being said It sounds like you need to sit down and discuss what is causing his changed mood. Communication is always key and I would be willing to bet It could help solve this problem you are having.", "NTA - your boyfriend is being very materialistic", "NTA. Your boyfriend sounds spoiled and too focused on money.", "Nta. Yay you for relying on your income !", "NTA - he knew you had a reduced income so of course you\u2019re not going to spend the previous amount. Also, it sounds like you were very generous. He seems very ungrateful and not as understanding as HE may think he is\u2026 maybe have a rethink on the relationship.", "NTA. You did put thought and effort into it. Your bf needs to grow up and see that this was within your means and will be the foreseeable future of birthdays for him.", "NTA. Wanting to make it in this world on your own dime is commendable. If your bf doesn't get this, then let him find another ATM.", "NTA\n\nLad seems spoiled out of his mind.", "NTA - You didn\u2019t state your ages, but based on your BF\u2019s behavior I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s 12??    OH!!  What a disappointment!  No clowns, balloons or a pony! The HORROR?!   /S.  You were kind and as generous as your finances allow.  That\u2019s  good in my books.  Good luck with your Prince Charmingless, you\u2019ll need it.", "NTA, he needs to understand there is more to life than getting lots of shiny things\n\nAnd good for you for getting independent", "NTA. Sitting down with your boyfriend and having a serious discussion about what you both want might be a good idea. You've obviously had a realization that you want some independence and to pay your own way - even if your parents still support you. He might not have the same ambitions as you so it's possible your paths may diverge. Then again, I have no idea how long you've been together or how serious your relationship is so I can't judge but I hope you get to be with someone on the same page as you who respects your choices and the consequences of what you're doing to further yourself in life. You don't deserve to be disrespected or made to feel less because of changes you're making in your lifestyle. Good luck!", "NTA \n\nBut can I get ages please?", "NTA - as long as you got him something that aligns with his likes and/or hobbies, you did nothing wrong. It\u2019s about the thought not the amount. Everything we buy is garbage anyway. Whether it\u2019s an iPhone, a bmw or a Gucci handbag\u2026\u2026 it\u2019s all garbage with fantastic marketing.", "NTA - how much you spend (or even can afford) on a birthday present should not define how he feels about you or the relationship.", "NTA and I'm bewildered by the privileged entitlement here. Being there for someone on their birthday is already a meaningful gift. Expecting *any* items, expensive or not, misses the point of gift-giving, which is that it should be a gesture from the heart and not something you demand from someone else. If there are physical gifts, wonderful, that's very nice of them. If there aren't physical gifts, also fine, as long as your loved ones are making you feel loved and valid.   \n\n\nThis is bratty, entitled behavior that I personally wouldn't tolerate. Red flags for any partner who demands this level of monetary pampering from you. You being there should've been enough for him.   \n\n\nHave a serious talk about how much his reaction hurt you and do a vibe check to make sure you are still compatible/your expectations in the relationship still align.", "NTA\n\n1. You shouldn\u2019t be expected to use your entire income for a birthday gift. \n\n2. Your boyfriend should be mature enough to tell you directly that he\u2019s upset. He sounds like he\u2019s in middle school from the way he\u2019s made his friend tell you the issue. \n\n3. You already had a conversation with him about how your spending needs to change. You still got him a nice gift, so he\u2019s just being ungrateful", "NTA.\n\nOh and... It may come as a shock to you but you've got yourself a gold digger there, lass. \n\nDump his ass ASAP and move on.", "Cut him loose. It\u2019s only going to get worse", "NTA, and your BF knows it. Let it go. \u201cMutual friend\u201d needs to learn how to close their mouth and not meddle. If your BF wanted you to know what was bothering him, he would have talked with you directly. Instead, it seems like he\u2019s trying to learn to rise above it, and mutual friend cued the drama.\n\nEdited to add: If BF wanted mutual friend to intervene, then this BF sucks anyway, so then I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t overspend on him.", "NTA.\n\nAlso, your use of the word \"our\" made me think this was a sweet home Alabama situation.

You explicitly told him that you wouldn't be able to afford your fancy expensive dates anymore, but he still insisted on having them and thus agreed to be the one paying for them. And then he has the nerve to complain that you didn't put enough thought and effort into his birthday? Quality watches can cost hundreds of dollars, and I think that much alone is enough to spend on him.

Were they chosen because he would like them or because they're an easy gift for a guy?\n\nIf the two items were bought with his taste in mind, then I'd vote n t a.
