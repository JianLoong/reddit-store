We never got along and were always fighting. But I always did my best to be a good sister. I gave up a lot in life for him and his events and never got much for myself growing up because it all went to him. That has lasted into adulthood.\n\n I went on to get married have kids and live my own life apart from him. He never showed up for any of it. To this day, we hardly ever talk. I try reaching out but he hardly ever responds. Once in a blue moon. He\u2019s recently met someone now and plans on spending his life with her. They both make very good money, more money than my husband and I and they travel constantly. We\u2019ve asked them when they would be able to travel to have family vacations or at least visit the kids and they always say they have no time. But then they will book trips to Europe or other places not caring how it affects the kids. Our kids ask about them all the time and we always have to make up reasons why they won\u2019t visit them. Our oldest has seen my brother 2 times their whole 8 years of life and our youngest only once. We\u2019ve tried very hard to visit them but they always decline saying they have no time for it. So we\u2019ve given up on them. \n\nFlash forward to last month. My husband surprised me with PIT tickets to a concert as our anniversary gift. I was so excited. I never get to do anything for myself and I get to go with a group of friends. I have also never been to a concert. This will be my very first one with an artist I really want to see. All my friends and I are planning a whole weekend getaway to make it even better. I shared a picture of the ticket on my Facebook and my future sister in law saw it and asked me about it. I told her all about it how excited I was and how it was my very first concert. It\u2019s a few months away but still I\u2019m so excited. Now today I just got word that my brother and sister in law are announcing their engagement, and they picked their wedding date\u2026 it\u2019s the same exact day of my concert. They picked the date AFTER my husband bought the tickets and we announced we were going. \n\nI\u2019m torn. I have a big heart and don\u2019t want to disappoint my family by not going. However they never show up for us or my kids so why should I care? They said they want my kids to be in the wedding as well. So if I don\u2019t go then I kind of ruin the wedding for them because they have to find replacements for my kids. I would like to go to the wedding to support them however my husband just spent $800 each on tickets. And they\u2019re non refundable. My husband says screw them they never come to us so why should we cancel a concert for them?!. But I\u2019m torn. I don\u2019t want my family angry because I chose a concert over my own brother\u2019s wedding. But then again I never get anything for myself. So AITA for not wanting to go to this wedding?", "created_utc": 1697554536, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17a08pw/aita_for_deciding_to_go_to_a_concert_instead_of/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Barely met the kids (probably when you traveled home to visit?) It sounds like your brother was the golden child. You were raised to always bow to his needs. I can see how this may concern you in terms of your relationship with your parents/ family. But it's time to let go of the idea that you and your real family will ever matter to him besides what you can do for him. Tell him you and your family are \"just too busy.\"\n\nGo enjoy your show. Wear strong shoes so you don't get trampled LOL.", "NTA they clearly are not interested in being part of your life, or your kids', and to be honest it sounds like they want you there to present an image of a close family for the wedding.  That's not the reality.\n\nThey also chose the one day you had other plans.", "NTA, this feels like a power move of your brother and soon to be sister in law, they knew the date of the concert and knew how excited you are. Then suddenly the brother who wants nothing to do with you or your children, wants your children in the wedding and you to attend, knowing that you will have conflict with your parents if you don't show up. \nDecline the invite and put up with the argument it will cause.", "NTA.  You have important plans on that day.   You send your regrets and go to the concert!", "NTA, In the end, you still want to have a good relationship with your brother but you've actually given up. I think I would have the same doubts as you at that moment, but you have to decide for yourself what is more important to you - The wedding or your own marriage or the concert with your husband. I could understand it very well if you decided to go to the concert and I think that would be my decision too, since your brother said goodbye to you and your family years ago. Just because he's getting married now doesn't mean that years of neglect are suddenly gone, he should know that even if he's a grown man.", "NTA. Your brother has not invested in your life at all, don't sacrifice to keep up appearances at his wedding.", "\nI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re conflicted.

They\u2019re not interested in spending time with you/visiting. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty easy to explain to your kids that you and uncle aren\u2019t close, that\u2019s why they don\u2019t see them. \nIf you don\u2019t tell them about the wedding, they won\u2019t know what they might miss. \n\nYou\u2019re already busy! You have plans. Don\u2019t stress about problems that really aren\u2019t problems.", "NTA. \n\nIf you and your children were important to the wedding, they would have checked the date with you and scheduled the wedding for a date that worked for you. \n\nIf they cared for you and your children, they would have visited in the last 8 years or taken up your multiple attempts to plan time together. \n\nGo and do what brings you joy. You can be very graceful about it- \"I'm sorry, that date doesn't work for us, the tickets are nonrefundable and this is a group event so others are relying on us. We can do any other date, I do wish we would have chatted before you booked things but I understand how planning is and I'm sorry to miss your big day. Hopefully we can get together another time to celebrate.\"\n\nAnd then just...don't engage. Anyone who reaches out or pressures you: we already declined because we have other plans, I'm sad to miss it but what can you do; Oh we understand they picked the date that worked for them, unfortunately it is the only weekend we had something we couldn't change; We sent our regrets and I'm sure they will have a beautiful day, we can't wait to see pictures; well I don't think our absence will ruin the day, it is THEIR day about their love, we wish them the best. \n\nJust give short answers and don't get in to a back and forth. In your mind remember- if you were that important to them, they would have planned with you, they would have visited, your brother would have a relationship with you. To me, this feels like they want the appearance of family- everyone is there, there are cute children walking down the aisle, they filled all the seats- and not about actually caring about family.", "NTA. Why are you still thinking about them? Clearly you have no value to them. Whether or not you attend, the wedding will happen. Like you've said they never made time for you. It's about time that you reciprocate that indifference.", "NTA. Go to the concert. I bet that if you told them that you\u2019re going to the wedding, the wedding date would miraculously change. You owe them nothing.", "NTA. There is nothing to be torn about. You already have plans that were arranged before and that\u2019s it. Your kids would probably thank you for not going to the wedding as I can\u2019t think of anything worst than being part of a wedding for people I don\u2019t know. Send them a wedding gift and enjoy the concert.", "I think you should do whatever feels right for you. If you are not close, it should be easy to say, \"Sorry, but we have a previous commitment.\"\n\nI do think that you are involving your children too much in family politics. Why would kids care if their uncle goes to Europe instead of visiting them, if they barely know him. Don't lie to them and make excuses. Just tell them that he is busy. \n\nAnd why would you tell the kids that they were asked to be in the wedding party before you decide to attend? That is unnecessarily setting them up for disappointment.", "Listen to your hubby on this one\u2026your future sil knew your plans and chose that day anyway. Plus as many times as your bro stonewalled you this is turnabout\u2019s fair play.

You clearly included that little bit to show that they could go on vacations, and not that they would go even if they had no money. It was an important detail to include that I\u2019m sure helped prevent a lot of confused info comments.", "This is so bizarre. Some serious CB vibes here. My kids grew up without their uncle in their lives and it made zero difference.", "Real question, though. From what you describe, they don't have a relationship with him and they're not spending time with him. Why are they crying about not seeing someone they don't usually see?", "And I can see you're jealous you don't get a bunch of cool vacations? What's your point?", "Thank you. I really appreciate it. Yes I explained finances because some people might have asked if they could even afford to visit us. Because the economy right now is hard and most people aren\u2019t taking vacations etc. we are very blessed and fortunate that we can take vacations ourselves. But wow I didn\u2019t think me staying that would make me \u201cjealous\u201d of their money. Why would I be when we financially are doing more than fine on our own? Makes no sense.", "Unless you are OP, your kids are not OP\u2019s kids. How do you know that they don\u2019t want OP\u2019s uncle in their lives?

Why did they have to go? Why can\u2019t they move here?\u201d It was extremely hard on him. Our youngest son is now only 3, not autistic, and she cries whenever brother cries. She will ask questions but not much. She was only an infant. We also have pictures in the home of them so our youngest looks at the pictures and will ask about them.", "Who says we don\u2019t get cool vacations??? Hahaha! This past summer we just took a family vacation to Hawaii. We get 2-3 vacations a year. So what are you trying to prove??", "Okay, that's fair. As a mom to an autistic near-adult I can see that.  My personal advice (if you want it, so take this with a grain of salt) would be to limit exposure to Uncle as much as possible, and work with your providers to help him cope. At this point, even talking about pursuing a relationship with someone who clearly wants nothing to do with you or your kids is actively hurtful. \n\nDefinitely don't entertain your brother's insistence on using your kids as props for his wedding.", "Once again, sure Jan.
