We never got along and were always fighting. But I always did my best to be a good sister. I gave up a lot in life for him and his events and never got much for myself growing up because it all went to him. That has lasted into adulthood.\n\n I went on to get married have kids and live my own life apart from him. He never showed up for any of it. To this day, we hardly ever talk. I try reaching out but he hardly ever responds. Once in a blue moon. He\u2019s recently met someone now and plans on spending his life with her. They both make very good money, more money than my husband and I and they travel constantly. We\u2019ve asked them when they would be able to travel to have family vacations or at least visit the kids and they always say they have no time. But then they will book trips to Europe or other places not caring how it affects the kids. Our kids ask about them all the time and we always have to make up reasons why they won\u2019t visit them. Our oldest has seen my brother 2 times their whole 8 years of life and our youngest only once. We\u2019ve tried very hard to visit them but they always decline saying they have no time for it. So we\u2019ve given up on them. \n\nFlash forward to last month. My husband surprised me with PIT tickets to a concert as our anniversary gift. I was so excited. I never get to do anything for myself and I get to go with a group of friends. I have also never been to a concert. This will be my very first one with an artist I really want to see. All my friends and I are planning a whole weekend getaway to make it even better. I shared a picture of the ticket on my Facebook and my future sister in law saw it and asked me about it. I told her all about it how excited I was and how it was my very first concert. It\u2019s a few months away but still I\u2019m so excited. Now today I just got word that my brother and sister in law are announcing their engagement, and they picked their wedding date\u2026 it\u2019s the same exact day of my concert. They picked the date AFTER my husband bought the tickets and we announced we were going. \n\nI\u2019m torn. I have a big heart and don\u2019t want to disappoint my family by not going. However they never show up for us or my kids so why should I care? They said they want my kids to be in the wedding as well. So if I don\u2019t go then I kind of ruin the wedding for them because they have to find replacements for my kids. I would like to go to the wedding to support them however my husband just spent $800 each on tickets. And they\u2019re non refundable. My husband says screw them they never come to us so why should we cancel a concert for them?!. But I\u2019m torn. I don\u2019t want my family angry because I chose a concert over my own brother\u2019s wedding. But then again I never get anything for myself. So AITA for not wanting to go to this wedding?", "created_utc": 1697554536, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17a08pw/aita_for_deciding_to_go_to_a_concert_instead_of/", "score": 115, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Barely met the kids (probably when you traveled home to visit?) It sounds like your brother was the golden child. You were raised to always bow to his needs. I can see how this may concern you in terms of your relationship with your parents/ family. But it's time to let go of the idea that you and your real family will ever matter to him besides what you can do for him. Tell him you and your family are \"just too busy.\"\n\nGo enjoy your show. Wear strong shoes so you don't get trampled LOL.", "NTA they clearly are not interested in being part of your life, or your kids', and to be honest it sounds like they want you there to present an image of a close family for the wedding.  That's not the reality.\n\nThey also chose the one day you had other plans.", "NTA, this feels like a power move of your brother and soon to be sister in law, they knew the date of the concert and knew how excited you are. Then suddenly the brother who wants nothing to do with you or your children, wants your children in the wedding and you to attend, knowing that you will have conflict with your parents if you don't show up. \nDecline the invite and put up with the argument it will cause.", "NTA.  You have important plans on that day.   You send your regrets and go to the concert!", "NTA, In the end, you still want to have a good relationship with your brother but you've actually given up. I think I would have the same doubts as you at that moment, but you have to decide for yourself what is more important to you - The wedding or your own marriage or the concert with your husband. I could understand it very well if you decided to go to the concert and I think that would be my decision too, since your brother said goodbye to you and your family years ago. Just because he's getting married now doesn't mean that years of neglect are suddenly gone, he should know that even if he's a grown man.", "NTA. Your brother has not invested in your life at all, don't sacrifice to keep up appearances at his wedding.", "\nI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re conflicted.

You have plans. Don\u2019t stress about problems that really aren\u2019t problems.", "NTA. \n\nIf you and your children were important to the wedding, they would have checked the date with you and scheduled the wedding for a date that worked for you. \n\nIf they cared for you and your children, they would have visited in the last 8 years or taken up your multiple attempts to plan time together. \n\nGo and do what brings you joy. You can be very graceful about it- \"I'm sorry, that date doesn't work for us, the tickets are nonrefundable and this is a group event so others are relying on us. We can do any other date, I do wish we would have chatted before you booked things but I understand how planning is and I'm sorry to miss your big day. Hopefully we can get together another time to celebrate.\"\n\nAnd then just...don't engage.

In your mind remember- if you were that important to them, they would have planned with you, they would have visited, your brother would have a relationship with you. To me, this feels like they want the appearance of family- everyone is there, there are cute children walking down the aisle, they filled all the seats- and not about actually caring about family.", "NTA. Why are you still thinking about them? Clearly you have no value to them. Whether or not you attend, the wedding will happen. Like you've said they never made time for you.

You owe them nothing.", "NTA. There is nothing to be torn about. You already have plans that were arranged before and that\u2019s it.

If you are not close, it should be easy to say, \"Sorry, but we have a previous commitment.\"\n\nI do think that you are involving your children too much in family politics. Why would kids care if their uncle goes to Europe instead of visiting them, if they barely know him. Don't lie to them and make excuses.
