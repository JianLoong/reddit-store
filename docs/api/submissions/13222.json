Yesterday we decided to leave our Airbnb around 8AM cause we were taking public transportation to save some money and also had a guide visit at 9:30AM at the Edinburgh castle and according to google maps it would take us around 45 min to get there. Everybody got ready in time, except my stepfather Daniel (M46) who couldn\u2019t decided what jacket to wear\u2026 that already made us a couple minutes late but wouldn\u2019t miss the bus. He then picked out a very big and heavy red jacket, we all asked him multiple times if he was sure because the jacket was a lot even to carry around all day. But he was certain. \n\nINFO: The walking distance from the Airbnb to the bus stop was 10 min, we left the house around 8:10AM and the bus was supposed to arrive at 8:25AM. \n\nAs soon as we arrived at the bus stop Daniel decided that we were right and the red jacket was too much then went back to change which made us to miss the first bus. My brother and I got a little annoyed but mom said we had time. Daniel took 15 min to return then he said that he was going back because the jacket he picked now wasn\u2019t warm enough. That made us miss the second bus. He came back wearing the exact same jacket because he didn\u2019t got to change it cause he got lost and couldn\u2019t find the house (it\u2019s a suburban area and the houses looks very similar). At this point, we all were very irritated but he went back anyway. The 3rd bus was arriving and my brother and I decided to take it. Mom didn\u2019t like it and asked us to wait. We agreed for her which guess what? We missed the 3rd bus. Now there was a chance of us being late because was around 8:45AM at this point. Daniel returned and everything seemed fine, we waited for the bus and as it got there and Daniel tried to find his phone but couldn\u2019t\u2026 he forgot it at home. My brother and I had enough and wouldn\u2019t miss this bus. We went ahead and said that we would be meeting them at the castle. They arrived at 10AM and couldn\u2019t join the guided tour but we did lol\u2026 Daniel was upset and said that we had the whole day to visit the castle and wouldn\u2019t make a difference at what time we arrived there. Mom supported us but said she talked with Daniel and he\u2019ll apologize if we do the same but I feel like we didn\u2019t do anything wrong but according to him we were kind of a**hole. I don\u2019t want to drag this and ruin the vacation\u2026 what do you guys think?", "created_utc": 1679832466, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/122k4c9/aita_for_leaving_my_stepfather_behind_in_our/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I suspect the answer is \"no\".", "Danny is all about Danny and his comfort I think your mom see this but ignores his rude behavior. Try have a beautiful holiday you did nothing wrong.", "NTA are you sure he is a grown man???? This seems excessively indecisive for an adult. You are on vacation and someone EXPECTS you to wait around for them because they can\u2019t get their jacket business situated is ridiculous.", "NTA. Try and enjoy your trip.  You are a lot nicer than me. I would have gotten on the second bus.. maybe even the first.  \nHe's trying to control the situation for some reason. That's a version of weaponized incompetence he's using to get you all to do what he wants or maybe just not what you want.", "I've already lost patience with Daniel. I'd have been on that second bus. \n\nDaniel needs to get his shit together.

I can\u2019t believe your Mom didn\u2019t leave with you as well. I will give one buses grace period (and not happily but I get we are human) after that\u2026best of luck sunshine.", "Ok, because of his relative youth, stepfather *probably* isn\u2019t presenting with the early stages of dementia\u2026 he just travels with too many fashion options. One wonders how *many* pieces of luggage he might have\u2026\n\nYour mama should start dressing him like she would  have dressed you when you were toddlers. Here you go, honey, this is your outfit for today! Oh, my, you look so *handsome*! Did you remember your phone? Where is your phone, is in our pocket? \u2026But I digress. \n\nNo, OP, you and your brother waited long enough while indecisive guy farted around. Did he ever even make it to the castle? And while you may have had all day to see it, one presumes *you had other things to do that day besides standing around waiting for him to pick which clothing option may or may not have been most appropriate for the day*. \n\nGoing forward, I would suggest always *meeting* your mom and her fellow at the intended destination, rather than travelling together. *That* way, you might actually get to do or see the thing, instead of missing the  bus. NTA", "NTA. You did the right thing in getting on the bus and getting the guided tour.  Your stepfather and mom still get to look round the castle, they just missed the tour due to your stepdad being weird with his clothing and phone choices.\n\nWhen I was getting married, I planned a very low-key wedding - ceremony in Leith registry office - we had the space for fifty minutes exactly and then we all had to be out of there to our reception in a local pub, The Village, self-catered. The one requirement of the day was that EVERYONE HAD TO BE THERE ON TIME. So we arranged for our friends to meet up in The Village,  five minutes down the road, and then they could all walk over to the registry office together. \n\nMy sister made the mistake of asking, was there anything she could do to help? Yes, I said: Get our parents to the registry office ON TIME and unflurried, because my mum was JUST like your stepdad - she'd miss four buses she should have caught because of indecision about what to wear and forgetting her phone or her keys or something else. My sister gamely took this on, and my parents DID arrive at the registry office on time, which they probably wouldn't have if left to themselves.  \n\n\nYour stepdad is a chronically always-late person. He is doubtless delightful and has many good qualities, but it is fatal to let yourself be held up waiting for them. Just catch the bus you intended to catch, and go do what you meant to do, and when you get married, get your brother perform the same hero's service my sister did in getting our parents there on time.   \n\n\nEdinburgh's lovely this time of year! Enjoy.", "NTA. You and your brother had been patient and waited for Daniel multiple times, but he continued to change his mind and cause delays, making it impossible for you to arrive on time for the guided tour. It was understandable that you and your brother decided to take the bus without waiting for Daniel and your mom. Additionally, you didn't do anything wrong by going ahead with the tour while they caught up later. Your stepfather was upset about missing the tour, but his indecisiveness and forgetfulness were the main reasons for it. It's reasonable for him to apologize if he wants to, but you were not at fault for his mistakes.", "NTA that's ridiculous to have to repeatedly wait for his mistakes.\n\nMy father used to do stuff like that when I was a child. All because he didn't want to do anything with my mother's family.", "ESH. \n\nYou could\u2019ve got on the bus to make a point, and then waited for them to join another guided tour together. \n\nNow it was almost a waste of time for your mom and Daniel to show up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

After all that, I'd be super annoyed too, but if he apologized and moved on all would be forgiven. BUT he wants you to apologize when you all were ready and waiting for what an hour? Guy needs to accept that he didn't have his shit together and it was inconsiderate to expect everyone to alter their plans because of it", "Nta. You established a boundary. Just dont engage in any more discussion about it.", "Yeah I would have gone \"okay, see you at the castle!\" the first time he went back", "Great point!", "There are two types of people on holiday. There are the OPs, who will get an early start to make the most of their days, and there are the Daniels, who have no sense of urgency. If you spend your entire vacation waiting around for the Daniels, you'll miss out on a lot.\n\nEvery family has a few Daniels. If they are considerate travel companions, they will take things at their own pace, but accept that other people may have different priorities and timelines.\n\nOP made it sound like they'd booked the 9am tour. Mom and Daniel missed out and just hung out at the castle for the day. It's unfair for mom and Daniel to expect the group to miss out because he can't get his shit together."]}
