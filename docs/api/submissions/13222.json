Everybody got ready in time, except my stepfather Daniel (M46) who couldn\u2019t decided what jacket to wear\u2026 that already made us a couple minutes late but wouldn\u2019t miss the bus. He then picked out a very big and heavy red jacket, we all asked him multiple times if he was sure because the jacket was a lot even to carry around all day. But he was certain. \n\nINFO: The walking distance from the Airbnb to the bus stop was 10 min, we left the house around 8:10AM and the bus was supposed to arrive at 8:25AM. \n\nAs soon as we arrived at the bus stop Daniel decided that we were right and the red jacket was too much then went back to change which made us to miss the first bus. My brother and I got a little annoyed but mom said we had time. Daniel took 15 min to return then he said that he was going back because the jacket he picked now wasn\u2019t warm enough. That made us miss the second bus. He came back wearing the exact same jacket because he didn\u2019t got to change it cause he got lost and couldn\u2019t find the house (it\u2019s a suburban area and the houses looks very similar). At this point, we all were very irritated but he went back anyway. The 3rd bus was arriving and my brother and I decided to take it. Mom didn\u2019t like it and asked us to wait. We agreed for her which guess what? We missed the 3rd bus. Now there was a chance of us being late because was around 8:45AM at this point. Daniel returned and everything seemed fine, we waited for the bus and as it got there and Daniel tried to find his phone but couldn\u2019t\u2026 he forgot it at home. My brother and I had enough and wouldn\u2019t miss this bus. We went ahead and said that we would be meeting them at the castle. They arrived at 10AM and couldn\u2019t join the guided tour but we did lol\u2026 Daniel was upset and said that we had the whole day to visit the castle and wouldn\u2019t make a difference at what time we arrived there. Mom supported us but said she talked with Daniel and he\u2019ll apologize if we do the same but I feel like we didn\u2019t do anything wrong but according to him we were kind of a**hole.

So we arranged for our friends to meet up in The Village,  five minutes down the road, and then they could all walk over to the registry office together. \n\nMy sister made the mistake of asking, was there anything she could do to help? Yes, I said: Get our parents to the registry office ON TIME and unflurried, because my mum was JUST like your stepdad - she'd miss four buses she should have caught because of indecision about what to wear and forgetting her phone or her keys or something else. My sister gamely took this on, and my parents DID arrive at the registry office on time, which they probably wouldn't have if left to themselves.  \n\n\nYour stepdad is a chronically always-late person. He is doubtless delightful and has many good qualities, but it is fatal to let yourself be held up waiting for them.
