When I first started working here she would comment on how she always liked my nails but say she that she never buys nail polish because she only uses it a few times a year and thinks it's a waste of money (she makes significantly more than me and this is all over a $10 Essie polish for added context). One day she asked if I could paint them for her for a trip she was going on with her husband later that week during lunch and I thought it was a little weird but it wasnt a huge deal and agreed. A few months later she went on another trip and she asked if she could borrow the same one again, but that she would do it herself at home and bring it back the next day. I agreed and she did return it. Now today a few months after that, she asked me for the same color nail polish for a third time and this time I looked at her funny and told her if she liked it that much I think it's time she just fork up the $10 and buy it. She looked taken off guard and offended but agreed she probably should just do that instead. I know it's cheap nail polish but it felt weird to keep borrowing something to someone who I know can afford \"luxuries\" like nail polish.\n\nEdit: The coveted nail polish color lol\n\nhttps://www.essie.com/nail-polish/enamel/nudes/lighten-the-mood", "created_utc": 1678984070, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11syuya/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_she_should_buy_her/", "score": 151, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

One time is fine to see if the color works with your skin tone, but after that, buy your own.", "NAH \n\n\n\"Over 3 years time\" sounds like a lot, but \"3x in 3 years,\" isn't really that much. \n\nDoes nail polish go bad? Like, if she kept it for 3 years, would she be able to keep using it (I genuinely have no idea). \n\n\nI think it's fine to say \"I'm not comfortable lending out my nail polish any more, but reminder, the color name is X, and it's like $10 at CVS\". She reacted fine--it's okay to be taken off guard when you thought you were making a reasonable ask and feel guilty that you were taking advantage of someone.

The places I go to have used a plastic liner in the basin as a protective barrier but agree that can also be cause for infection.
