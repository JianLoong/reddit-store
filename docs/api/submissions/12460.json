When I first started working here she would comment on how she always liked my nails but say she that she never buys nail polish because she only uses it a few times a year and thinks it's a waste of money (she makes significantly more than me and this is all over a $10 Essie polish for added context). One day she asked if I could paint them for her for a trip she was going on with her husband later that week during lunch and I thought it was a little weird but it wasnt a huge deal and agreed. A few months later she went on another trip and she asked if she could borrow the same one again, but that she would do it herself at home and bring it back the next day. I agreed and she did return it. Now today a few months after that, she asked me for the same color nail polish for a third time and this time I looked at her funny and told her if she liked it that much I think it's time she just fork up the $10 and buy it. She looked taken off guard and offended but agreed she probably should just do that instead.

It would be almost like getting a fungus from a shared bottle of rubbing alcohol (also a solvent). \n\nSounds like your salon autoclaves their tools, which is ideal (and hopefully they don't re-use orange sticks or emery boards). If bringing your own polish makes you feel better, then do it! But again, you're more likely to get a fungus from common stuff like having sweaty feet, sharing a shower (including at home with roommates, family members, or guests), not drying feet properly, being over 60 (which drastically increases susceptibility to fungal infections), or sustaining even a tiny injury (cut/scrape), than by sharing polish. \n\nI hope your foot got better!
