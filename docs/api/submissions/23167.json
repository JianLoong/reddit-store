Their actions are idiotic. Suppose you do marry her, then how do they unfuck themselves? Don\u2019t be petty. Man up and marry the girl or let her go and definitely don\u2019t let them in your house.

Like not smoking in someone else's house, that is beyond rude and entitled!!!  I'd have thrown these idiots out by scruff of their necks if they disrespected me in my own home. WTF do they think they are.? Self righteous egomaniacal  pricks. Your wife needs to put her big girl pants on and stand up to them OP. Untill she does that they will continue to bully her and ignore your existence OP. If it were me I would be telling your missis her parents are no longer welcome in your shared home emphasis on shared not just hers. I would also go NC with the in laws even if your wife won't, after 10 years of their bollocks enough is is enough. They are not gonna change EVER so take yourself out of the equation and save your own sanity because they are way to high maintenance to bother trying.", "That's the golden rule. OP needs to follow the iron rule: do until others as they do to you.", "They have zero respect for him. Why would they respect a healthy boundary he sets? There\u2019s nothing he can do to make them respect him. He doesn\u2019t need to be a nice guy to them. He needs to leave his shitty girlfriend", "Fr, have some damn self respect for the love of god", "GF needs a spine though. She\u2019s fighting with her BF for growing a spine instead of defending him.", "GF is the problem because she is letting it go on in her house as well..if you are in a relationship and you let your family run over your spouse, then that\u2019s a you problem as well as the family..", "As someone who smokes myself, I can only go with this. _They even have a smoking area!_ If It would have been me, I probably would have stand beside them and spray at them with airwick constantly.", "Me too mate I'm also a smoker but would never dream of smoking in someone else's house. I love your airwick idea. Spray them all over every time they take a puff on their smoke and see who sick of it first. \ud83d\ude02.", "Like the Shelton cooper meme with \u201elove is in the air\u201c\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "NTA but you have a gf issue.\n\nShe can't have it both ways. She can't expect you to continue to be helpful and kind to them when they have been rude, cruel, and disrespectful to you. If she can't make and enforce boundaries in her own home for their behavior when they visit, why doesn't she just live with them? Your gf is going to have to make a choice here because they don't seem to be fine with being civil to you when you interact.\n\nHer argument should have been, \"Look, I know you don't like OP. I'm not asking you to like him. I love him and that should be enough for you to treat him with basic decency and respect. If you can't find it in yourself to do that much, then you're not welcomed in my home or in my life. The choice is yours.\"\n\nMic drop and let the chips fall. But she isn't doing that. She might make a little noise now and then when boundaries are being trampled on, but then she crawls right back to them for more and expects you to endure the treatment. However, you give them the same energy they give you and she's all over you? She does because she feels safe to vent her anger about your 'behavior' while expecting you to 'be the bigger person'. \n\nNo gf, needs to decide to whom and where her loyalty lies. If she can't unequivocally choose you, then leave her. You deserve a woman who has a spine.", "Dump the gf..actively enabling the wholesale abuse of her bf.", "NTA\n\nYou have a GF problem. I would simply not be socializing with my family if they treated my partner that way.", "Dude cut your looses and break up with tha terrible GF. She is part of the problem too. NTA.", "NTA\n\nGet a lock for your office first of all, second I\u2019m sorry to hear about your parents. \n\nThird you need to talk to your fianc\u00e9. If she will not stick up for you then she can\u2019t keep getting mad when you butt heads with her family that clearly doesn\u2019t like you. Go spend your birthday with your friends and don\u2019t go to events unless it\u2019s mandatory. Don\u2019t buy them gifts, don\u2019t piss on them if they\u2019re on fire. Just worry about you and your fianc\u00e9. If her family has something to say, have her put a stop to it or at least speak up once. If they keep going, then you can bark back. \n\nThough a part of me wonders what you could\u2019ve possibly done to make them not like you SO much.

I would've stopped showing up after they made you leave a dinner you were invited to.", "NTA. Your inlaws are major assholes (ffs refusing a birthday cake because you bought it?), but your gf should have stepped up a long time ago and told her parents that you ARE family and she expects you to be treated as such. \n\nI'm also suspicious that this is their less than subtle hint that you won't be considered family unless and until you're married. If your gf isn't willing to bring the hammer down, they have no incentive to behave differently. \n\nHave you considered moving away? Preferably, far enough that an airplane ride would be required for them to visit. If you broach the subject and she flat out refuses to consider it? There's your answer. She cares more about placating her family than you being treated decently, and that is unlikely to change.", "NTA\n\nMove out if you can and tell your GF that the relationship is over until she learns to stand up to her family. You deserve better than this.", "OP, after reading your edit: it's not you who have to set boundaries. It's your gf. She has to talk to her family. She has to tell them that you are her bf and that she expects them to be as supportive to you as to her. That they only getting back what they are giving to you.\n\nShe can compromise by some visits alone, but holidays and Christmas etc. Will be for a place that is supportive and happy for you both.\n\nNTA.", "I am NOT ragging on your choice to not be married.  That is entirely your choice.  \n\nHowever.  \n\nMy mother was a weirdo about my husband and I sharing her guest room before we were married.  We had both been married twice before. We were both over 45 and there was no question that we were cohabiting. And my parents thought he was/is ***great***. (She got us a hotel room rather than let us share a bed under her roof.) Once we were married, the craziness stopped.   \n\n\nIs it possible that your GFs family has a problem with you 2 living together, unmarried?  Since you have already bought a house together, it that something to consider?  Since you already think poorly of them, would them changing after you married make you think even less of them?  Or could that start to fix what is so badly broken?  \n\n\nI don't think Y T A. But, there has to be more to this than that they *all* just don't like you.  That's a big family to not have one friend besides your GF in the crowd.", "NTA but buddy, c\u2019mon now. You really been putting up with this from your gf and her parents for 10 years? Why? They broke just your stuff. You will never be treated properly in your own home because your gf allows it. I\u2019m not even sure she likes you at this point. She is the problem. I love that you are giving it right back to them. Good luck, pal. You\u2019re gonna need it. Do update us when she has broken up with you because you were rude.", "TEN YEARS. She had every opportunity to handle this.", "There is no middle. \n\nIf you are Christian or Jewish, the Bible says that a man and woman will leave their parents and cleave unto each other (Gen 2:24,  Matt 19:4-6)\n\nIf you do traditional marriage vows in the US of UK, you say that you will take your partner to be your husband or wife. It says nothing about your spouse's parents. \n\nNot only are they disrespecting OP as her partner, if OP actually was just a friend, it would still be rude to return a gift that was given in kindness.

At this point if  she hasn't checked her parents on your behalf you need to reevaluate your relationship. This has been going on for 10 years and she's done nothing?

If she\u2019s upset with you about how you\u2019re treating them, she should 100% be screaming at them every night for how they treat you. She is effectively caught in the middle, and just wants the problem to go away on its own, but the issue is that her parents are actively hostile, and her loving partner put up with that for a decade.
