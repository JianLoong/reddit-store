Your GF is the actual problem. She should have attempted to put a stop to the hostility toward you and the boundaries in place for the home you share. When that was ignored, she should have gone no or low contact.  After 7 years of abuse, you finally started dishing out what you had been receiving. It shouldn't have come to that because no invitations should have been accepted or extended years ago.", "NTA.\n\nBut I gotta tell you a hundred-year-old story from my family. Back in the day, my great-grandfather (the son of a fundamentalist preacher) married my great-grandmother (a devout young lady from a different religion). \n\nThis did not go over well with his family, and she was subjected to the same kind of hostility that you are putting up with. So my great-grandfather talked to his dad, just once, and said, \"This is my wife, and I love her, and you are going to stop being cruel to her and mocking her and her religion. Because if you don't, you will never see either of us ever again.\"\n\nIt worked. But it only worked because his dad knew it wasn't an empty threat, and he really would walk away to protect his wife.\n\nWhy isn't your girlfriend standing up to defend you?", "NTA - Your gf has to grow herself a spine and stand up for you. And honestly? I wouldn\u2019t allow anyone in my home who isn\u2019t even able to show me basic respect and manners.", "NTA So do on to others as  you would want done to you, you don't have to be a christian to follow that common sense. If they want to be respected by you they will start respecting you. Hopefully your GF stands by your side and not let them treat you this way.", "NTA. You've tried your best to build a relationship with your in-laws, but they haven't reciprocated. It's time to protect your mental well-being and set some boundaries.", "they don\u2019t like you and don\u2019t want their daughter date you . continue treating them like you been treating . nta", "NTA. But your girlfriend is. She should have had your back and let\u2019s her family mistreat you", "NTA tell your gf that you will never allow yoursrlf to be treated as lesser. \n\nI would also suggest making her choose a side. Tell her that if appeasing her parents is worth making you miserable then she doesn't treat your relationship seriously. Tell her that you want to go no contact with her parents. You will not visit them, and they are forbidden to visit you (home where you live). At least until they apologise and start treating you  with respect.\n\nIf it makes your relationship fall apart then it just means you were never going to be the priority in her life.", "NTA --- Tell your GF you're just giving them the same treatment that you get from them.", "NTA. But the main problem is your girlfriend. After 10 years you\u2019d think she\u2019d have your back. If I was this girl I\u2019d have said 10 years ago \u201cyou either treat him with respect or you\u2019ll not see me again\u201d.", "NTA. They sound toxic and controlling and like they've never accepted their daughter has an actual partner. Were they upset you moved in together at a young age and bitter about that? It's rubbish that you've put so much effort in and they treat you so shoddily. Instead of giving them back like for like, it might be healthier for you to go low or no contact. It must be very hard for your gf, but surely she can see how vile they are being. If she loves you she will support you and give you space from them. I'm so sorry you've had such a horrible experience. You sound lovely and caring.", "Soft ESH, and your GF needs to stand up and get your back. She should have insisted that you stay for the family dinner, and if not, then left with you. She lets too much of this slide.", "YTA for being with someone who allowed their family to continuously treat you horribly. not much has changed so why do you stay? your partner does not care about your feelings or peace and her loyalty lies with her family.", "Info... how are they with her siblings partners?", "Nta. Get a lock for your office and when they are around lock it.", "They don't like you?  People are polite to those they just don't like.\n\nBan them from the house, and stop buying gifts for them and attending any get togethers.  Your girlfriend should decide if she also wants to go no contact, but I would sideye her, if she's been ignoring how they treat you.  I get that this is how it's always been, but it's dehumanising and so not ok.\n\nGo to therapy with her, get some self esteem and let her know that she had to have a backbone for you.\n\nImagine if you had kids!  Her family would either pretend they don't exist, or try to poison them against you.  Plan now.", "Why are you with a woman who doesn\u2019t stand up to her family for you? You\u2019re supposed to be a team, and she doesn\u2019t have your back. You deserve better.", "NTA, I feel sorry for you GF stuck in the middle but if you've  made the effort and been rebuffed its ok to stop trying", "NTA - they obviously dislike you and all along only acted that way to trigger you to misbehave against them so they have something to criticize.\n\nCut them entirely out of your life, they cannot come over any more, this is also your home. You decide you enters YOUR space.\nYou also have to have a deep discussion why your GF let\u2019s them disrespect you the way they are and by acting this way (keeping herself neutral) she also disrespected you, because clearly your PIL are very rude and wrong. You tried to be as kind and civil as possible, they continue to dislike you so her daughter will get rid of you. SHE HAS TO POSITION HERSELF!!", "NTA, they everyone else is and I am including your girlfriend in that.  She had had 10 years to get her family to treat you with an ounce of respect and she hasn't due that. \n\nShe needs to get them to sincerely apologise for past behaviour or gtfo.\n\nIf she won't.. then there is no incentive for you to stay. You are worth more than that\n\nIs there a race issue here?", "NTA - (see edit at bottom) they feel justified in disliking you (probably because they think you\u2019re wasting their daughter\u2019s life by dating her forever but not committing) so they have no respect for you and it sounds like they go out of their way to be shitbags toward you (and by association, their own daughter.) Their actions are idiotic. Suppose you do marry her, then how do they unfuck themselves? Don\u2019t be petty. Man up and marry the girl or let her go and definitely don\u2019t let them in your house. It\u2019s gonna stay toxic for years though.\n\nEdit based on OP comment: changed from ESH to NTA. You sound like you\u2019re doing it right based on your comment.", "NTA. They dish it out, but they can't take it", "Why would you stoop to their level? If they can't respect your home, they shouldn't be in your house. If they can't treat you like a guest in their home and make you feel welcome, don't go to their home. \n\nA soft ESH. You didn't deserve to get treated like that, but giving it right back isn't going to help anything, as you can see.

They've marked your house as theirs. You are caught in the middle of a power struggle with this family and parents will win unless GF just starts cutting them out.\n\nThere are two choices to be made here. One by GF and one by you. GF must choose whose side she is on, you or her family. Her parents have shown this choice to be necessary because they will not accept compromise. Then you have a choice based on that.

You leave him out of photos and gifts I stay out of those things as well. Like she loves you but can't stand up for you after all these years? That's a problem. You two need to talk about that.

Her parents are assholes, but they would change their tune real quick if their daughter stood up to them and made it very clear that their behaviour ends now.\n\nIt's not unusual for kids to be afraid of confronting their parents or setting boundaries, but if you want this to change, that is what needs to happen.\n\nYou need to sit your partner down and explain to her that if she is really your partner, if you're really the love of her life, that she will have the difficult conversation with her parents, and will support you through actions such as leaving a family dinner, etc, until her parents learn that this is serious and you aren't going away. If necessary, she may have to go low or no contact with them.\n\nIt's an unfortunate situation, but if you want it to change, she needs to be the one, and I do think you need it to change.
