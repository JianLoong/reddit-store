Maggie (14f), Levi (12m) and Charlie (10m). (**NOT THIER REAL NAMES)**Levi and Charlie share a bedroom\nand Maggie has her own room as the oldest and also only girl.\n\nMaggie is a great kid. She does her homework, helps with chores without too much complaint, doesn\u2019t bug her little brothers (too) much. The issue is that she will not stop slamming her bedroom door. When she gets up to use the bathroom at night she slams her bedroom door on her way out and back in. When she gets up in the morning or goes to bed at night she slams it. Pretty much any time she enters or exits her room the door gets slammed. And it\u2019s only her door, none of the other doors in the house. It shakes the walls and frequently wakes up everyone else in the house. Her brothers room shares a wall with hers and our bedroom is directly above theirs.\n\nWe\u2019ve talked to her about it and asked her very politely to please be more mindful about it because it is disturbing the rest of us but it\u2019s in one ear and out the other. We tried being more forceful about it saying that if she continues to slam her door there will start to be consequences. Still nothing changes. It all came to a head the other night when she got up to use the bathroom and all 4 of us were woken up by the slamming. I have to be up at 5am for work and I\u2019ve had enough of the broken sleep and came downstairs and knocked on her door. She opened it and said *WHAT?!* with such attitude it took a lot of self control not to start yelling.\n\nI told her as calmly as I could that if she slammed that door one more time she was going to come home and find it gone. She proceeded to yell at me to leave her alone and then slammed it 5 times as hard as she could. Well the next day (Friday) she went to school and my husband and I both had the day off so we took the door off the frame and installed a curtain rod with a nice heavy curtain over the door instead. She came home and freaked the fuck out. She said we\u2019re being emotionally abusive and taking away her right to privacy. She sulked all weekend and won\u2019t talk to us now. My mother says I\u2019m the AH because I overreacted but she doesn\u2019t have to deal with the house shaking.\n\nI want to add that we completely respect each other\u2019s privacy in our house which is why we hung up a heavy curtain and made sure that we couldn\u2019t see through it or around it. We even put little Velcro pieces on the walls and curtain sides so it stays in place. She still has her physical privacy which she is absolutely entitled to, but can\u2019t slam a piece of fabric. We also have never and still don\u2019t just go into her room unannounced and still knock on the wall to ask permission to enter. We\u2019ve told her we\u2019ll happily put her door back on once she agrees to respect the no slamming rule. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit to add:\n\n1) The curtain is an industrial type that blocks sound and light\n\n2) The curtain is only meant to be a temporary measure. As soon as she agrees to stop slamming and be respectful of the shared space we will put it right back on.\n\n3) The door isn\u2019t broken or malfunctioning in any way and there is no draft causing it to swing shut.", "created_utc": 1678128900, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ka6ov/aita_for_removing_my_daughters_bedroom_door/", "score": 7796, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She has a curtain. It's thick and prevents people from seeing inside. Is it as good as a door? No. But as you said you can't slam a curtain shut at 5 am.\n\nIt sounds like she's going through some things as all teenage girls do. I'd try asking her about it once she calms down. Maybe put the door on after a couple days and see if she starts slamming again.", "NTA\n\nReminds me of how you can't slam phones down to hang up on someone anymore... lol *angrily clicks hang up button*", "NTA. \nYou had warned her repeatedly. When given the opportunity, she made it clear she had no intention whatsoever of complying with your request- even with faced with a specific consequence.\nYou followed through with the consequence, while preserving her privacy. Which I totally respect.", "NTA You warned her multiple times. You are simply removing the ability for her to be a disruptive member of the household. You could\u2019ve been TA if you had simply removed the door but you went out of your way to provide a heavy curtain. Honestly commendable.", "NTA\n\n\n>I told her as calmly as I could that if she slammed that door one more time she was going to come home and find it gone. She proceeded to yell at me to leave her alone and then slammed it 5 times as hard as she could.\n\nYou told her not to do something and her first reaction was to do it, not once, but repeatedly.", "NTA!  You\u2019re a good parent", "NTA! If she was left with a wide open doorway with no barrier, you might have been the asshole, but you set up the heavy curtain with Velcro and everything! She\u2019s still got her privacy but can\u2019t slam the door and disturb everybody else. Seems fair to me!", "NTA - personally think that you\u2019ve done a really good job of balancing consequences with maintaining privacy. It\u2019s hard job! My own teenager pushed boundaries so hard they almost got a diagnosis of ODD (on top of the ASD we knew they definitely had). I think as long as you let her work/earn her way back to having a full door (with anti slamming measures fitted) then no harm no foul. You can\u2019t let her continue to effect the sleep and health of the rest of the household like this or in a few years she\u2019ll be the subject of someone else\u2019s AITA post \u201cI took my roommates bedroom door off because she slams it 20x a day, AITA?\u201d", "NTA, usually,  I find removing the door to be a gross overstep, but you warned her and replaced it to maintain her privacy.", "NTA. You\u2019ve brought it up to her many times and the problem also is that she always slams it, not like after an argument once or twice. If you do put the door back on at some point, is there some sort of thing you can put on the door jamb or door or wall to keep it from slamming as hard? I have no idea why she is slamming it in the middle of the night 24/7 tbh", "NTA. Given the circumstances you've described, anyone who faults you for finally taking such a firm decision is an idiot. \n\nIs there anything else going on in your daughter's life that's causing her to act out in this way aside from the normal teenage rebelliousness that often comes with growing up? I'd consider sitting her down and asking her if there may be other things going on you might not know about.", "NTA when I was reading I was initially going to suggest a curtain, but reading further I saw that you already that covered, so well done, you gave her no excuse to moan about it and had a solution \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f totally NTA", "The fact that she slammed it 5 more times!\nTaking the door off was the least you could do. She has no respect NTA", "Put some annoyingly slow hinges on it- they put them in at my former work place and you couldn\u2019t slam anything", "NTA.  Interrupting everyone's sleep is unacceptable. You gave her plenty of opportunities to change her door slamming behavior and she didn't do it.  \n\nLet her sulk it out for a set amount of time (let her know this amount. . 1 week. . 3 days. . whatever you choose), then return the door conditionally for a trial.  If she can refrain from slamming it, she can keep it.  If not, the door gets taken off again for even more time.  Rinse and repeat until she no longer slams.", "I came in here ready to call OP the A here, since parents who remove doors tend to do it unreasonably. \n\n*However* OP handled this shockingly well. The blanket door and such was really well done. Maintaining her right to privacy is crucial and OP did that. \n\nNTA. But as others have said, it seems clear that there is more going on with OPs daughter. Sounds like she's in need of some sort of therapy.", "NTA, she's at that age where she needs to learn consequences for shitty actions/behavior. You should definitely give her a timeline when for when she gets the door back, maybe a month?", "NTA as you put up a privacy curtain.", "NTA, you gave her multiple warnings. And honestly, the curtain was a fabulous idea. I had my door taken as a teenager a few times for reasons I still don\u2019t think we\u2019re fair, and having no privacy, especially at that age, is so not okay. You removed the problem while still respecting your daughter as a person. Hopefully she\u2019ll learn her lesson from this.", "NTA. My parents took my door off because I slammed it. I'm in my 40s now and still haven't slammed a doro since.", "NTA you warned her many times, her attitude was completely unacceptable, and you are still respecting her privacy. I have seen and heard many instances of doors being taken that were awful and borderline abuse, but this is definitely not one of them.", "NTA. \n\nAfter that many warnings and talks there needs to be a consequence. Especially after yelling at you and slamming it on purpose, in front of you, in the middle of the night AFTER you asked her to stop doing it and clearly stating what will happen if she does it one more time - you can never go back after threatening a consequence for bad behaviour and I personally think you showed her your own and the other family members' boundaries and also that you respect her privacy. If she can't stop slamming a door, she doesn't deserve one. She needs to learn to be considerate of other people and their needs. The accusation of you being emotionally abusive after disturbing everyones sleep is kinda rich. If her slamming was just a habit that's difficult to unlearn, a curtain is a very good method as well. The grandma doesn't have to live with the doorslamming teenager, so she has no right to judge you.", "NTA My father had 3 daughters, and we were all teens at the same time. Doors were slammed constantly. We came home one day after school and not just the bedroom doors, but EVERY door in the house was taken down. (My mom was pissed, but understood.)\n\nMessage received, Dad. The next day the doors were back up and we never slammed them again.", "NTA\n\nIt's a contentious issue, removing a teenager's door.  Privacy needs, personal autonomy concerns, space issues.  However, this was not a spur of the moment decision, this was a specified consequence of an action that she was warned about.  She chose to slam the door after being asked repeatedly not to do so, and even after being warned that the door would be gone.\n\nAs for privacy, unless the door had a lock on it, she has as much privacy with her industrial curtain with velcro strips as she did with the door.  That covers that.\n\nAny time she brings it up, just remind her that all she has to do to get her door back is promise not to slam it anymore.", "I was prepared to come here and say Y T A, however after reading the whole thing, absolutely NTA.\n\nYou talked to her about it, she intentionally spammed it 5 times after waking the whole house up.\n\nIf you had put nothing,  I absolutely would have still said you're T A, but you got her a heavy curtain and a way to fasten it so she has Privacy.\n\nAbsolutely NTA. There's no excuse for her behavior,  and maybe she'll think about other people the next time she earns back her door privileges. \n\nGood luck OP", "NTA - she still has privacy she\u2019s just lost the privilege to damage your home.", "NTA. I think you handled it well you told her what would happen, and you also didn't barge into her room the night you had enough. You were calm and courteous. You even take efforts to not just go into the room with a curtain. You knock on the wall, it must be bad for it to disrupt your sleep like this.", "NTA. You have a whole house's worth of family agreeing that this was an issue born of inconsideration, gave fair warnings, and ensured that the consequences didn't take away a teenage girl's need for privacy. Well done! The only issue I can really see is if the younger boys don't respect her privacy, or have been/start going into her room now that there's no \"door.\"\n\nWhile there may be an underlying issue if she's normally a great kid, and you may want to talk to her about it once she's calmed down... But at that age, the devil's in the hormones, so good luck!", "NTA\n\nYou went above and beyond what you needed to do to ensure her privacy, while also removing the source of great disruption to the house. \n\nAbusive would be no curtain, or taking the door off for no reason. \n\nYou are doing what you all need for a solid night's sleep, and giving her a more gentle form of retribution than future flatmates may do. Shared housing ranges from mildly passive aggressive to straight up aggressive. Certainly the latter when sleep if being messed with.\n\nHave a chat with her though if she's waking up when everyone else is sleeping consistently, and she's still getting up early in the morning. Frequent need to urinate during the night can be a sign of diabetes. Or she might have insomnia (self induced, or no fault of her own), which will make many a PITA after a bit.", "Nope NTA this is a teenage girl testing boundaries and respect being handed rightful consequences of her actions.", "NTA that's amazing my hat goes off to you! Brilliant idea and the fact you gave her a curtain is so good youre only removing the physical issue! Hope she learns", "NTA. \n\nYou were informative on the specific action and why it is disruptive. \n\nYou voiced if it continues there would be consequences. \n\nYou even gave her a privacy courtesy when consequences came. \n\nShe has to learn that she is not in the right here and that her actions will come with consequences. \n\nI did this stuff as a teen too. I didn't get the courtesy of a curtain. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, you gave her a fair warning and then a replacement.", "NTA, finally a \u201cdoor removal story\u201d that isn\u2019t YTA. Seems as if there has been plenty of previous convos about the issue and with punishment privacy is not lost. So W parenting imo.", "NTA. I\u2019m usually on the side of kids are entitled to their privacy, but she\u2019s been talked to about this multiple times and continues to do it (maybe intentionally?). And she is doing it ALL the time, but just when she is mad or upset. She\u2019ll be fine and hopefully will earn her door back.", "NTA at ALL. Honestly I was ready to go E-S-H from the title but you gave her a heavy curtain. She still has her privacy. I think you handled that situation extraordinarily well.", "NTA - That's what I call \"check-mate.\"  You're teaching your kid a valuable lesson - actions have consequences.  And she's even able to reverse this decision - if she \"agrees\" to not slam.  Which, for some reason, she's won't agree to it?  PS - the curtain was a great touch.", "NTA.  But when it comes time to re-install her door, go to the hardware store and by the foam stripping that is meant to stop drafts thru doors. It will be impossible for her to slam the door.", "Nope NTA. We did this to my daughter around that age as well until she learned to quit slamming hers. Actions have consequences and she knew what they were gonna be. Sounds like there\u2019s no real reason for her to be slamming it constantly except for being a moody teenager.", "\"I told her as calmly as I could that if she slammed that door one more time she was going to come home and find it gone. She proceeded to yell at me to leave her alone and then slammed it 5 times as hard as she could\"\n\nI guess she made that decision on her own and was very sure about it (5 times sure).\n\nNTA", "NTA and have dealt with a similar situation (though our kid would only do it when upset) and even did the same thing, though only because the door did eventually break. \n\nThe whole privacy thing isn't really even an issue. She can change in a bathroom. Many kids share rooms. Many people live without bedrooms even. Somehow they get by. She'll be fine.\n\nYou may need to look into this behavior though and seek counseling for your daughter.", "NTA. Although I think you should investigate the reasons why she's acting like that. Taking the door is not gonna fix her problem. Maybe she needs to see a psychologist. Talk to her in a moment where she's open to a conversation and tell her that you want to know what's going on. Say that you will start considering her opinion on the door problem when she proves that she can talk maturely, and tell you what's going on. Once she sees she can talk to you openly, maybe she'll tell you what's happening or why she was acting like that. If that doesn't help, offer the psychologist, maybe she'll feel more comfortable with that.", "I\u2019m just curious\u2026have you asked her why she\u2019s slamming it? It seems like there\u2019s something going own especially with the unwarranted attitude? \n\nNTA", "Put a closer on the door instead of replacing it with a curtain. Cheap, easy, you get to keep the door, and it'll be impossible to slam. e.g. https://www.homedepot.com/b/Hardware-Door-Hardware-Door-Accessories-Door-Closers/N-5yc1vZc7km", "NTA. And can I just say great job parenting.  You still are respectful of her privacy. You didn't react out of anger. But you followed through with consequences after you told them what the consequences would be. That is good parenting.\n\nThe only I would suggest is sitting down and discussing what she can do to earn it back and if she gets it back what that looks like  in terms of slamming. \n\nBtw I think they make a piece that keeps it from being thrown open or shut you can attach to the door. Ends that slamming from happening might wanna look into that.", "I think it's a perfect consequence, but I also think it needs a clear end date.  Like, you get the door back in 1 week.  If she keeps slamming it after that, you just silently take the door off again for another week.  I think if you wait for her \"agreement\" it becomes a power struggle instead of parenting.", "NTA - Once she slammed the door 5 times after you called her attention, it showed that she was doing it all on purpose. She knows that there are consequences to her actions. \n\nShe still has her privacy but if she wants her door back she should prove that she\u2019s going to be more mindful of everyone else in the house.", "NTA. Been there, done that. Lol", "NTA plus she gave you attitude after all those warnings I\u2019d say she deserve a little lesson on how to be considerate", "NTA\n\nCan't help wondering whether daughter has read a few of the \"AITA for removing my child's bedroom door\" posts and decided to test you. Reddit tends to judge those as Y T A because, importantly, posters don't replace the door as you've described.", "NTA\n\nYou talked to her about this many times. She didn't listen.  She's old enough to understand that actions have consequences, the consequence which you spelt out for her.

She still has privacy so NTA.", "NTA. You talked to her over and over. She threw a fit and then purposely slammed it several times in a row. You told her what the consequences were and she chose to not respect the boundary.", "I was fully prepared to let you have it over the title, but with context NTA at all. Actually I think you handled it perfectly. She still has her privacy, you gave her plenty of chances and she deliberately doubled down on the disrespect. Well played.", "NTA Her behavior is ridiculous. She was asked nicely, told what the consequences would be for continuing the behavior, and was then rude and willfully defiant. Your punishment is entirely appropriate. She still has privacy but won't be able to disrupt the rest of the family's sleep. Let her sulk all she wants.", "You gave her ample time and a fair reason to stop. That she turned around and slammed it 5 times in a row, she threw away her right to have a door to slam. You gave her curtains to keep her privacy, that is enough.\n\nNTA\n\nAsk yourself if there is a way to earn her having the door back, and let her know what you want, if she really wants that door. Until she is willing to meet your rules, keep the door.", "NTA. \n\nI've always had a problem with parents removing their kid's doors.  \n\nBut this is way different, and for a different reason.  It's not that hard to not slam a door. At this point it's just defiance.  You've been patient and reasonable, and made sure she still had her privacy. \n\nGreat job.

You warned her multiple times and you solved the issue while maintaining her privacy.", "NTA\n\nI was all ready to go in the other direction, but I think this is fair.\n\nYou had MULTIPLE conversations with her.

You brought this up to her many many times.  For all those asking if there's something wrong with the door.  Sounds like all the verbal conversations that went on before this decision that could have been brought up but wasn't.  Daughter had PLENTY of time to voice this if it was the case.  You told her exactly what was going to happen if she continued, and she continued.  Plus the solution is simple.  Just stop doing a behavior that she doesn't need to do.  She still has her privacy.

Your options still gives privacy and is a middle ground where your daughter can still learn a lession. I've read some comments about things that can dampen the sound or let it close slower.

Its not a big deal to take an extra second to make sure the door closes softly (even if its heavy or there is a draft). Giving her one of the soft closers or paddings gives the wrong impression.

That's a good lesson : you can't trample on others peace without having yours disturbed.", "NTA. You tried being nice. When that didn't work, you explained what the consequences of her actions would be. After she decided to throw it back in your face, you acted on that and meted out the punishment.\n\nThis is parenting. She needs to understand how to be courteous around others in a shared space, especially since you work early to provide for your family. She may have personal problems, but that is no excuse to lash out at the rest of the family, especially if it isn't about them.", "NTA. you made sure she still had her privacy and that the curtain isnt cheap. stick to your guns.", "Yea, NTA! She needs privacy, but she has that. She wants a door back, respect others and stop slamming it.", "NTA - Give her a chance to earn the door back after a suitable punishment time with the clear understanding that the door will go away again if she continues the bad behavior. Sounds like you\u2019re doing a great job.", "NTA great parenting. Actions have consequences, she learned that.", "NTA- she has a curtain so she does have privacy,, She was warned loads of times and now has to deal with her behavior.", "NTA for sure, she still gets her privacy with a curtain, but doesn't get to slam a door. This is really the best solution. I've read many taking away door stories and  this has nothing to do with privacy issues, so I think you're doing great OP.", "NTA. You showed her that the real world has consequences, and you've also told her you'll put the door back if she doesn't slam it. You're a good parent, don't let anyone else tell you otherwise.", "NTA, but add something for the curtains for extra privacy. Hooks on the walls she can tie them to so they don\u2019t blow open, or a sign that says when people are allowed in. Once she respects the rules, she gets her door back.", "Nta as long as she has a not extreme way to earn it back", "NTA She knows what she is doing.  Something else is wrong If she can't understand or care about community logic with shared spaces etc.\nYou handled this well.  Plenty of people don't have a room of their own let alone a house that they share with family.  She needs to stop or learn the hard way", "NTA. Usually parents remove doors for absolutely no reason. However, you had a good reason. Correlated consequence, and you said you'd put it back once she becomes more respectful about it.", "NTA. OP handled it with grace honestly. And to those saying there might be something wrong with the door, she slammed it 5 times on OP, she's not remotely sorry.", "I don't support taking doors off as a punishment, but it seems you were polite, gave warnings, and she still has her physical privacy, so I don't see a problem. As long as you make sure it is not permanent NTA.", "NTA - but I have to question Maggie's temperament. Slamming the door repeatedly in your face when you escalated to asking her in the moment not to slam, and then flying off the handle and calling you \"emotionally abusive\" when you removed it and gave her a curtain?\n\nDoes she have other behavioral problems? It might not be a bad idea to have her see a therapist. Especially as she gets older, you don't want these behaviors to escalate into manipulation and emotional abuse coming from herself.\n\nI lived next to an absolute nightmare of a couple and one of the girlfriends \"control\" tactics would be to slam her front door repeatedly whenever their fighting would spill out into the foyer (which is basically always did).", "Barring any issues with the door, NTA.  Even kids can fuck around and find out.  You gave her a curtain so she still has her privacy.  You\u2019ve asked multiple times for her to stop.  This is not emotional abuse.  She\u2019s being dramatic.  Plenty of people live without a door.", "she lost door privileges **but** you let her keep her right to privacy.\n\nI see no issue with this, NTA.", "NTA\n\nAnd that's what consequences look like.\n Good job!", "NTA.\n\nShe has her privacy with the curtain.  Maybe give her a time frame for when she might earn her door back on a probationary basis.", "NTA atleast you gave her a curtain for privacy when I had my door removed for the same reason I was allowed no privacy and got in trouble for trying to put a blanket infront of my door and it was like this for ages so I had no privacy and it also disturbed my sleep.", "NTA. She knew what she was doing, and she's mad that she has to face the discipline. Her reaction before and after you took the door off says it all. Stay calm as you've been doing. She knows what she has to do, but will try to wear you down. Keep fighting the good fight!", "NTA. You had an issue, you asked, have plenty of opportunity for correction and she flew directly in the face of that. You laid out consequences. And you delivered on them. \n\nOne she ends her tantrum and she will engage in discussion on it, get really pedantic. SHOW her how to gently hold the door and push it closed when leaving and entering. Show her that SHE HAS THE POWER TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. \n\nShe is the cause of this issue and it\u2019s consequences. If she wants something different she has only to do this one very simple thing.", "NTA. \n\nI was going to mention I hope you put up a curtain. You guys did as i read through. There's no reason to slam a door and wake everyone up", "NTA, I think you handled that well. She's very much old enough to know that she shouldn't be slamming doors, and also old enough to learn that her actions have consequences.", "NTA the curtain was a good move.", "NTA\n\nIf she didn't want it removed, she shouldn't have slammed it. It was extremely rude to do it 5 more times. I'd hate anyone who slams the door late at night.", "NTA. However, if you decide to give her door back you could consider one of those door restrictors that stop slamming? Like a soft close option in hotels? Good luck!", "NTA. This is called good parenting. You still respected her need for privacy by providing her with a curtain, but also taught her respect and boundaries by enforcing rules.", "NTA\n\ni was so ready to call you TA, my mom took my bedroom door away for a few years (i think i was like 11-13/14, something like that) but i didn\u2019t have a slamming problem, she just didn\u2019t trust me? i was also a good kid so it made no sense to me but whatever. the thing is her room was literally right next to mine, & i didn\u2019t get so much as a THIN curtain or anything. i. was. pissed. i wanted my privacy. \n\nyou kept respect for her privacy while still solving the slamming issue. good job!!!", "This was beautifully handled. Her door slamming was a persistent problem, so the door was removed and another form of privacy was installed. NTA op, well played.", "NTA totally appropriate. When I was young I slammed the door frequently enough that my dad started making me go back and close the door 10 times quietly. I would get louder as I did this and he would make me start all over again. It worked and I did this with my own kids. Probably better for younger kids but it was tactful.", "NTA...you asked multiple times. You did right. Your solution for a curtain is great. If you dont keep your word she will only get worse. By doing this you are preventing her from becoming an asshole", "Sounds like creative and exact parenting to me.\n\nFuck around and find out. She found out didn't she.\n\nNTA", "I fully expected you to be T A, but I'm going to go with NTA. There was a direct connection between her actions - slamming the door inappropriately in the middle of the night, causing significant disruption to others - and the consequence of losing the door. You also didn't just leave a hole in the wall, but ensured she would still have privacy by installing that curtain. And then in your replies you have a clear and very reasonable timeline for how the door can be restored. In other words, it's in no way an arbitrary and indefinite punishment intended to humiliate the child and deny them privacy or autonomy.\n\nMost \"I removed my kid's door\" stories are raging A Hs, but in this case I'm not sure what else you could have done short of significant modifications to the door that might not have even worked.", "NTA you tried it the calm way. I don\u2018t see any problems, because she still has another option to have her privacy.", "NTA. You sound like thoughtful and considerate parents, I know for sure that I'd never have been given a curtain if I was disrespectful in that way. I think this is a pretty normal trial and tribulation for a teenager and you navigated it well.", "NTA especially after the yelling and slamming five times. Also you are prepared to put it back when she agrees to be considerate to the rest of the household.", "NTA you told her time and time again not to be slamming the door then she did it on purpose 5 times to make you mad. You told her the consequences and now she has to deal with them. I had friends who were being disrespectful and disruptive towards their parents and the same thing happened. You\u2019re just disciplining bad behavior. You go!", "NTA, it sounds like she just needs to learn the hard way.", "You are great parents, at least based on your explanation of what happened, how you handled it.  NTA.", "I came in loaded to affirm your being TA, but reading the whole context, NTA. She can learn to respect everyone else in the house or she can enjoy the use of a privacy curtain indefinitely.", "NTA especially as you have warning and replaced with a curtain. Maybe when you replace the door see if you can get a soft close mechanism like on cupboard doors so she physically cannot slam it", "NTA. \n\nYou're NTA because you gave a lot of warning. It would have been bad and actually borderline abusive if you did it on the first offense or if she does it really rarely (once every few months) by accident. But it seems like it's a regular occurrence and you tried talking to her several times. She forced your hand.", "NTA\nI had door slamming issues as a kid. I got mine taken off at least 2 separate times. It sucked when it got taken off at first but I got used to it and learned my lesson. I don't hate my parents for it and looking back, I understand why they did it and it worked. In addition, you installed a curtain as well. It's not like you completely took away her privacy. What she's doing is extremely disrespectful and having that behavior continue into later teens and adulthood will only cause problems for her in the long run.", "NTA,  She had plenty of warnings, and you're following-through.  Done!", "NTA, she needs consequences for her actions.  You also respected the purpose of the door by giving her a tool to maintain her privacy and a way to regain the door.  This seems like proper parenting and a great teaching moment.  \n\nDon\u2019t want her growing up into those jerks who doesn\u2019t think of how her actions impact others, plus in other people aren\u2019t always so decent in their reactions.", "NTA. I\u2019m still in my teen years, although out of the house now. Living with other girls my age in a house in college, there are so many things about living with people that I\u2019m so glad my parents weren\u2019t lenient on. It\u2019s made me a better housemate, and taught me how to be respectful of others in a shared living situation. You gave warnings, and when those were not respected you followed through. To top it off, you gave a curtain which is loads more than most parents would do tbh. As long as this is a short term thing, I think it\u2019s a fair punishment.", "NTA. You asked her to stop. You told her to stop. You told her the consequences if she didn\u2019t stop, & you followed through with those consequences. She still has her privacy. What she doesn\u2019t have is the means to be rude & disrespectful to everyone else in the house.", "NTA. Removing a bedroom door is iffy parenting if the purpose is to take away privacy. This is specifically about the door. You aren't being emotionally abusive or cruel. Have you asked her why she slams the door? If it's just that she's forgetting to be gentle with it, maybe a soft close attachment would help. If she's doing it to get attention or act out, getting to the root of that may help.", "NTA\n\nActions have consequences. You tried to be nice and asked her to stop, you even warned her this would happen if she didn't stop, so now it's her own fault the door is gone.\n\nTry talking to her about the necessity of slamming her door. Maybe now she can me more open about it, and if not, then the curtain stays.", "NTA this was honestly beautifully handled. It\u2019s one of those learning moments for your daughter, hopefully she takes it to heart.", "NTA. I can't even imagine closing my bedroom door in the middle of the night if I got up for a quick bathroom trip, let alone slamming it. You kept privacy in mind and didn't half-ass the replacement, either. There's no reason to be slamming a door indoors, and if it was a known tricky hinge, then there should have been extra care on her part to make sure it *didn't* slam at all times.", "NTA - Personally I think it's a good compromise. My parents removed my brothers' bedroom door once for a similar situation, and they didn't even get a curtain. So, I think you're already showing you do value her privacy.", "NTA.  you didn't take away her privacy, just the door she wouldn't stop slamming. This is a consequence of her actions, and the curtain is sufficient.", "Nta. You explained the issue and where the boundaries were and she pushed them. Its not in her best interests for there to be no follow through. The heavy curtain was a good idea.", "NTA. Actions = meet consequences. You don\u2019t get to be a disturbance to everyone else in the house and get off scot-free.", "NTA you're allowed to sleep (your child is 14, not 4) and you have two other kids that are waking up because of this.\n\nHonestly you handled this so well. You didn't take away her privacy, but yes she lost her door privileges. \n\nI know you said she's a good kid and I'm not saying she isnt- but there might be something going on if her response to asking her nicely not to slam a door is to slam it 5 times. Is she okay?", "NTA, imo seems like a nice compromise. Im not even sure how this would even mess with someones privacy, hanging doors arent the most sound proof in the first place.", "NTA - I normally don\u2019t condone removing a bedroom door as punishment but she fucked around and found out, and the heavy curtain will give her the privacy she needs. Hard lesson learned\u2026.make her earn the door back and the second the slamming starts again it\u2019s gone for good.", "NTA \n\nMy mother drug my mattress out of my room and placed it in the dining room when I was about her age for the same thing.

I'm usually not a fan of doors being removed as punishment because most of the time the punishment doesn't fit the crime and the purposeful lack of privacy (I've seen parents even take the door off of teens *bathrooms*) is gross and usually is a form of emotional abuse. However, she was definitely slamming the door on purpose. Next thing you need to do is get her some professional help. Attitudes like that are normal for a kid her age but the way your described her actions sound like there's more to it than normal puberty woes.", "NTA. You clearly warned her multiple times. She FAAFO.", "NTA, actions have consequences and as her parent, it\u2019s important that you follow through.", "NTA, but have you asked her to come upstairs and hear how loud it is when she closes the door at night? Some people really have no idea how loud they are being until they hear it themselves.", "NTA - seems like a pretty decent compromise honestly. Only thing I'd suggest for the door was if you might be able to put some sort of a stopper or deadening material around the frame so it's impossible to slam. They also have those slow-close hinges that it is impossible to slam. \n\nI don't know if that is going to solve the disrespect piece of it though. No reason for her to be slamming the door on purpose as she's throwing a tantrum.", ">She proceeded to yell at me to leave her alone and then slammed it 5 times as hard as she could\n\nNTA lol\n\nShe probably wants some attention though. This door thing might be a symptom.", "NTA. I wanted to go with y t a at first from the title, but I read through the whole thing. I get it. You are trying to raise a respectful child. I think there could\u2019ve been other consequences first, maybe missing her allowance or extra chores, before the door actually came off. But you\u2019d still be getting woken up, so I don\u2019t fault your decision. Sleep is important, and her reaction of slamming the door in your face was unacceptable.\n\nEdited for clarity.", "NTA. Was going to say YTA- they have special equipment to handle door slamming that you could install. BUT girl went down the attitude lane and found out. You also have a curtain up right now until she changes her attitude about it. I think attitude is everything and you\u2019re doing a great job.", "NTA\nThe curtain is a reasonable compromise. She still has her privacy, and the consequence  was directly related to the door slamming.", "NTA\n\nYou tried addressing it with her several times. Her behavior was thoughtless and inconsiderate and she just kept on doing it. A heavy curtain will be perfectly adequate to give her privacy. After a while, she can try the door again, and if she still slams it, that door can come right back off and the curtain will go right back up, rinse and repeat, until she learns to shut a door softly out of respect for the other people in the house.", "NTA\n\nBecause her slamming the door is so loud it wakes everyone else up, and she refuses to not slam the door, this is the best alternative.\n\nI think there are things you can attach to doors (I forget what they're called) which prevent a door from being slammed.  But if they can't be used on inside doors, it's perfectly reasonable to give her a heavy curtain.\n\nShe is definitely being the AH here, by refusing to respect a basic \"no slamming your bedroom door\" rule.", "NTA. When I was your daughter\u2019s age, my mom took off my doorknob. I still had the privacy of the door, but it was no longer slammable.", "NTA you gave clear and fair warning. She was given more than enough chances to not do it and she decided to do it 5times purely because she was testing you and didn\u2019t think you\u2019d actually do it. You followed through with the consequence and she still has privacy, you did good. \n\nIt might be worth telling her that after a period of good behaviour you may revisit the door issue and give her another chance to prove she\u2019s responsible enough to have the door there without slamming it. Right now she\u2019s continuing the prove she\u2019s not mature enough to have one.", "At first I was like maybe, then I read you gave her a curtain.  Thus maintaining a sense of privacy for her so I  gonna go with NTA.\n\nActions have consequences.  I was a teenager with explosive anger issues - I lost my door for 3 months until I learned how to close it properly (I never slammed it when  people were sleeping just when I was angry).  I remember being so pissed off but now as an adult I can see why my mom did it, I was an asshole, and I could have had it back sooner but it took me 3 months to figure that out lol.", "NTA.\n\nShe\u2019s going to be more cognizant of not slamming her door in the future.", "NTA, you're not taking it as a punishment for something else, you're taking the door as a direct consequence of what she's doing. She has been asked several times not to slam the door, and hasn't stopped, so it's 110% on her. Can she work towards earning the door back? If so, explain that to her so she doesn't think this is permanent punishment. Have you asked her if she's doing it on purpose or if there's maybe possibly a draft that's causing it? I ONLY suggest that because when we moved into our apartment we noticed there's some kind of air pressure difference (I guess?) and we end up slamming our bathroom/bedroom door often when we don't mean to, my fiance and I have to apologize SEVERAL times a day saying we didn't mean to lol.", "NTA\n\nActions have consequences and you warned her. She tested you and found out you weren\u2019t joking.", "NTA because you still made sure she *does* have privacy", "NTA\n\nLike a few other people have said I would instal a hydraulic closer so it can\u2019t be slammed shut. \n\nYou handled this in a very calm and rational way and I absolutely applaud your patience in the heat of the moment. You followed through on very thought out planning. She gets her consequence for acting out while maintaining her privacy. Very well done in my opinion.", "NTA. She was warned and it\u2019s not like there\u2019s nothing covering the entrance to her room.", "NTA, I\u2019m sure you made sure she was slamming it and not something else making it slam. She is acting out for some reason or another, or she just feels entitled and needed to be knocked down a peg. You provided her with cover (the curtain) so she has privacy, she can\u2019t claim you didn\u2019t give her privacy. Only an idiot would say that wasn\u2019t private. Now, when you decide to put the door back on, get the hydraulic door closer. Then if she wants to slam it she has to try hard, and you\u2019ll know she is doing it on purpose. Also make her pay for it. Take it out of her allowance or how ever she gains money from you. If she breaks it make her buy it again. This ensures she won\u2019t break it because she won\u2019t want to lose the money she has.", "NTA. you warned her calmly and then still maintained her privacy when you took the door off. \n\ni\u2019d tell her that if she slams it again (when you put it back), a soft close stopper will come out of her allowance/holiday money. maybe understanding it\u2019ll be solely her money will spark an attempt to close the door softly without it.", "I would recommend weather stripping on the door for any one in this situation. \n\nMy mom did that to us. Still had privacy, locking, etc. but we could not get the door to slam no matter how hard we tried. Just a soft thump. As a teenager super aggravating, looking back though can see the genius of it. \n\nNTA since there's still privacy", "Teen years are natures way of making sure we are ready for them to leave the nest.  Leaving the nest is better than filicide.  Once you said you would do it, and she responded by slamming it 5 times, you had to.  And the heavy curtain was good effort to make sure it met its need.  NTA", "When you give it back, install one of those pneumatic arms that are on convenience store doors that cause them to close slowly. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t understand your daughter at all. \n\nBut you gave her a nice curtain to respect her privacy and your ears, which is fair.", "NTA - you are actually parenting your kid and deserve a standing ovation. So many people don\u2019t know how to parent their children these days. Koodos to you!!", "NTA. Actions -> consequences. It costs literally nothing to close a door properly and at some point her slamming the door progressed from maybe accidental, to careless, and then to reckless/disrespectful. She was clearly warned of what would happen, and she chose to fuck around and find out. The curtain is a nice compromise that still provides her with the level of privacy she should need.", "NTA very creative way to use this form of punishment while preserving privacy", "NTA\u2026you tried. You asked her. You told her.  And then \ud83d\udeaa\n\nThis is good parenting.", "NTA:\n\nOf course, she's going to disagree and yell and scream about this, because, teenagers. However, you gave her plenty of warning, plenty of chances. You even told her this was going to happen.\n\nYou even left a curtain up there for privacy, which was great. Now, you just need to get her on that path to getting the door back in place, eventually. Maybe after a couple months she will appreciate the door enough to stop slamming it every time she goes in and out of her room", "NTA I wish I had thought of a curtain! I had a wedge I put on top of the door and have even used a towel but those are too easy to remove. \nYou gave the warnings and followed through. The early teen years suck", "How is this creepy, they specifically made an effort to protect her privacy still. They also did say they told her to stop on multiple occasions. You are reading way to far into this situation", "NTA. I was a door slammer as a kid and it most definitely taught me lessons on controlling my behavior and understanding consequences. I didn\u2019t have a door on my bedroom for years\ud83d\ude02", "Absolutely NTA. Only thing that makes me not like it is because of the fire hazard of not having the door. Fire safety includes keeping bedroom doors closed at night. \nBut sounds like she is going to get it back in a certain amount of time. I would probably just glue some felt or foam around the edges so she can\u2019t slam it anymore.", "NTA, but wtf is her problem? Who tf slams doors in the middle of the night? If you hadn\u2019t already done the curtain thing, I\u2019d say wait until the next she\u2019s sleeping and just start slamming her door and see how she likes it.", "NTA. Actions, meet consequences. My parents did this to my older sister when we were teens because she was always mad as hell at everything for no justifiable reason and unreasonably defiant with a massive sense of entitlement. The door slamming was epic and upsetting to everyone. She had a lot of warnings. My parents explained to her that she needed to recognize that she was privileged to have her own room and more privacy than a lot of other people her age. She sulked for weeks, tried to blame her behavior on everyone else, but eventually realized she wasn't getting her door back anytime soon with that attitude. For my parents, this was more about getting my sister to show some respect to the rest of the family. She eventually got the door back. My dad said if she reverted to her old ways, he would install a hydraulic door limiter on the first offense. She never slammed the door again.\n\nEdit: misspelling", "NTA\n\nYou gave her more chances than most parents would. The curtain will suffice for now - I'm 21 and I have a curtain for my basement room, because installing a door wasn't structurally or physically convenient! She will live.\n\nUnfortunately, the internet is filled with examples of very unfair parenting and the \"taking off your door\" is a common example. For those cases, they do it to invade privacy. She is unfairly extrapolating that example, not realizing yet, that you replaced it temporarily, as a direct consequence of her actions.\n\nI was a terrible teen at that age too, if this is reflective of the rest of your parenting, then she'll hopefully grow out of it one day!", "NTA\n\nShe's showing a complete lack of respect.  She's been talked to multiple times.  She knows what she is doing.  Then to slam it 5 more times out of anger and spite?  You did well and still gave her privacy.", "W mom. This was the best punishment. You still let her have her privacy, but just took her door. Absolutely NTA and I commend you on your amazing parenting skills.", "NTA, you asked nicely, you warned her there'd be consequences and she was defiant and rude about it.  I don't see any issues with what you've done at all.", "NTA: but is her bedroom window open ? If I go to close my door in any pressure it will slam if the window is open. I love the window open , so I hold the door handle until it\u2019s closed. \n\nShe\u2019s disturbing everyone in the house. Sleep is vital to health. Of course she\u2019s going to be angry, but it\u2019s good you\u2019re teaching consequences. \n\nIf it\u2019s clear how she earns her door back I can\u2019t see how that\u2019s abusive at all.", "NTA. I slammed my door a few times in anger when I was about Charlie\u2019s age, and my father immediately broke it so it never closed fully again. That\u2019s what my therapist calls a dick move. You on the other hand, have provided her with a solution that doesn\u2019t compromise her privacy. It doesn\u2019t feel like a punishment at all, but then again I\u2019m not 14. It wasn\u2019t emotionally abusive, even though she feels that way right now. I think giving her some space right now would be good, and maybe y\u2019all can have a mature conversation about this soon. If everyone decides that the curtain is the best move for right now, why not let her pick one out? It would be a pretty cool backdrop for selfies, not to mention it would give her agency over the situation.", "NTA, she is pulling the \u201cemotional abuse\u201d card because of tiktok and other social medias that are slamming all kinds of punishment right now, it\u2019s one thing if it happened once and you took it away because then it wouldn\u2019t be earned. But as a 19 year old who had their door taken as a kid, as long as she has a curtain and her room isn\u2019t just open to the rest of the house she should have no problem. (Unless she\u2019s having conversations on the phone she knows you wouldn\u2019t approve of) this is a totally fair punishment. My parents would have grounded me for a week every time I slammed it so I\u2019d say you\u2019re being pretty tame.", "You still gave her a curtain so she could actually have privacy? Then yeah, NTA. You told her there would be consequences and that's the most apt one. The only issue is privacy, and I don't see how a curtain doesn't provide that where a door would, except maybe sound, but it's not like bedroom doors are sound proof anyway.", "I usually have a really, *really* strong hatred for removing a teen's door, for any reason, because I usually think it's a weird punishment that doesn't fit the behavior, and just comes off as controlling and creepy.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the door itself is the problem here, because of the slamming. And yes, you gave her a lot of warnings AND it sounds like you have made sure she has complete privacy. So for now, a *tentative* NTA.\n\n\n\nBUT I think you really need a sit down to figure out why slamming her door is a thing. Was she purposefully messing with the household? Was it a way to get out some kind of frustration? If she doesn't have a door to slam, is the source of it just going to find another outlet? I find it fascinating when an otherwise pleasant and well behaved kid has such a disruptive but random form of rebellion.\n\n\n\nAlso, there are different types of closers you can get for doors that prevent slamming. I think no matter what, a real door is best. I'd go online and find the kind of closer that would work for that door. This way she has a real door that she can close and lock, but she can't slam it. And keep working on what the source of her need to slam it is.

She's a little old for it, but I used to run back to my room and slam the door to protect myself from the \"hallway monster\" that was always chasing me when I was 10 or so.

You tried talking nicely to her, you set a reasonable expectation, you laid out the consequences, and you followed through. You still gave her a heavy curtain so she could retain her privacy, even going so far to provide velcro on the sides.\n\nThat is A-Grade parenting, honestly.

I was the girl slamming doors and my parents took it away several times. Mostly it was because I was slamming out of anger at them but it was an effective consequence in my opinion looking back. I think it is great that you did curtains as I just was told to go into the bathroom if I needed to change or some privacy. \n\nI couldn\u2019t tell you one specific thing that got my attitude to turn around, but I do know my parents always tried to frame things with real world contexts and something more physical than \u201cit bothers others\u201d since that line of thought didn\u2019t seem to resonate with me until I was 16. Don\u2019t slam the door because of how it hurts the door frame, plaster coming off the walls, Costs to repair, etc. I had other behavior issues going on that they said I would end up in jail, so then the missing door was a representation of the lack of privacy you get in jail. You have to respect things in order to use them. \n\nA lot of the \u201crespect the door\u201d conversations then translated into \u201crespect the car\u201d concepts once I started driving.

If you fail to discipline your children, the world will do it for you, but far less gently.", "NTA - Normally removing a door is wrong but you gave her a great privacy solution so she can't assert you've taken any privacy away. You also gave her plenty of warning and time to fix the behavior on her own. I would come up with a plan to get the door back though. Tell her she needs to deal with the curtain for at least a week because you all deserve sleep, and if she behaves during that time (ie no slamming other things to make a point) the door can go back up for a trial period.", "NTA. Remind her that her right to privacy doesn't come before everyone's right to rest, and that's why you found a perfectly good solution that keeps her privacy and allows rest for everyone.", "NTA, but check that door. It may have a propensity to slamming. \n\nFor example, in my house, if a window was open in my brother's room, my door would close really fast and always sound like it was slamming. Window closed it was normal sounding. \n\nFor all we know, maybe she is trying but it's just the way the door behaves. \n\nMaybe lining the door frame with some velvet or felt or something so it hits soft fabric instead of a hard surface can help mitigate the sound.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA especially because you put a quieter substitute so she still has privacy. I get up at 5am too and can feel your pain.", "NTA.  When I was 12, my parents took my door for a week because I slammed it.  I never slammed the door again.", "NTA! She\u2019s being awfully passive aggressive", "NTA.\n\nYou gave a clear, related consequence and followed through. The curtain maintains some privacy but is less desirable than the door. My first thought was that maybe the slamming wasn\u2019t her fault, but the fact that she did it in your face 5 times makes me think that it is probably a conscious choice.\n\nI will add that as a kid (and sometimes still as an adult), I used to annoy my mom by pulling doors shut behind me without turning the handle so they \u201cclicked\u201d closed. She never took my door, but she hated the sound and would sometimes get mad at me for it. As a kid, I never really understood why because I thought that was just what doors did and she never really explained the difference between what I did and how she wanted it done. To that end, I hope once things calm down, you can have a conversation about *why* she feels the need to slam the door, especially late at night.\n\nIf it turns out to be an emotional regulation issue, I hope you get her someone professional to talk to. Either way, I want to magnify all comments saying that you get a device that will prevent the door for slamming once it goes back, and make sure you talk over with your daughter why that device is necessary (either because the door does something annoying that the device can prevent, or because it can stop her from using the door as an outlet while she works on how she\u2019s feeling).", "NTA. You established yourself as the parent and you\u2019re showing her the consequences of her actions, even if they are \u201cunfair\u201d to her. She\u2019ll get over it.

I feel like your daughter may have some other issues - anger issue or control issue whatever - that you may not know about. If she\u2019s a great kid otherwise like you suggest, I wonder if she has some other resentment that she\u2019s not able to bring up.", "I applaud you for giving her a curtain so she still has privacy and she will learn the hard way how you shouldn't slam the door.

You tried multiple times to address the unwanted, disruptive slamming behavior and she refused to adjust, which forced your hand. I actually suspect she\u2019s been doing it on purpose in an effort to annoy everyone, but that\u2019s just a hunch. I think you showed remarkable restraint in that last interaction, btw. I think I may have lost it on her. \n\nYou chose to give a punishment that directly addressed the bad behavior and you covered any concerns about privacy with a heavy curtain. If a child cannot be trusted to use an item as intended, which in this case is closing the door in a reasonable fashion, she doesn\u2019t get the benefit of having that item to abuse. This retired child psychologist approves, so long as this punishment has an expiration date. Hopefully it won\u2019t take long for her to learn her lesson. NTA", "NTA!!

Slamming the door, five times in a row, in her parent's face, in the middle of the night, disturbing everyone's sleep. \n\nI would have done exactly the same. Brilliant parenting. Keep following through! \n\nNTA a million times over.", "Adding padding is a good idea, some of the doors in my house slam, even when we try to close them carefully", "My mother would have tanned my hide if I ever slammed a door spitefully, let alone waking up the whole household in the middle of the night.  Different times, I know, but kids these days...\n\nDarn, I feel old saying that, lol.", "Growing up, there was no better way to escalate an argument with my parents than slamming doors. They\u2019re pretty reasonable people who rarely get angry, but if my brother or I slammed a door they went white-hot with rage. \n\nWhen my dad was young, he and one of his siblings got into a fight and one of them slammed a door accidentally catching the other\u2019s hand in the frame badly breaking it, so not slamming doors became a safety concern for them", "I was thinking of those fire door things they put on doors in rental properties which mean the doors close super slowly.", "The curtain put it in NTA territory for me.", "The abusive parents would never install a heavy curtain, and then ensure it was sealed to the walls like OP did.\n\nFor the most part 'took the door off' gets my radar up.  But this?  If you are gonna do it this is textbook why to do it and how to do it.", "Honestly. People are acting like Op shouldn\u2019t parent her kid for purposely slamming the door as hard as she could.", "This. You are NTA and are handling this very well, but it's worth trying to find out why she wants to be so disruptive, why she's so angry. Is she being bullied at school, for example?", "I think you could still slam a door without a knob though. It won\u2019t stay closed but you could slam it. I honestly think your solution was the best.", "The heavy curtain is a good substitute, but you could install a door damper, which will slow the closing. \n\nNTA", "My dad did this to me for a weekend for the same reason. I\u2019d get angry and slam my door lol I\u2019m 48 now and perfectly fine. My dad\u2019s real point was that I could be upset and angry, but acting out instead of addressing my anger was going to create more problems for me in life than losing a bedroom door.", "It sounds like it's not just the noise but the force of it, if it's shaking the whole house.  Foam insulation tape might do a little bit for that, but almost certainly not enough.\n\nI'm absolutely voting NTA for OP here.  Plenty of polite warning, clear stated consequences, privacy maintained, path to getting the door back.  Ayep.", "Doors and attitude issues are like the teenage rite of passage. My stepdaughter put us through that recently. (Opposite of door slamming though.) She cussed me for knocking on her door. She was on a PriVaTe phonecall. I had her laundry for her. I asked her to open the door. She snarked.\n\nTook the laundry back to the laundry room and let her Dad handle it. My inlaws also weighed in. They threatened to take her door. Her Grandmother (We live with inlaws) threatened to put a bar of soap in her mouth for cussing me. Especially since she had told her 10 times to come get her clean laundry that we washed and folded.\n\nHer phone hours got reduced. No calls after 9pm. But man she's so pleasant now.", "God yes. My siblings and I were like ninjas.\n\nNot just night. My mom was a night shift nurse. If you woke her... nothing in the verse could save you.", "you can get auto closers for interior doors they are smaller than the big ones for fire doors. they work well, I had one on a door to our stairs so it would close automatically.", "Yeah. The curtain is a great idea. She still has privacy with a lot less slamming and disturbing everyone's sleep. Slamming 5 times in a row also tells me the other times it has happened is more likely intentionally than accidental.", "For real. I\u2019m also hesitant about \u201ctook the door off\u201d stories, but abusive parents don\u2019t look for thoughtful and effective alternatives to preserve their child\u2019s sense of privacy", "Man I know it\u2019s the times we live in and my mom should NOT have been using physical punishment but man I wish I would slam a door in my moms house. She would\u2019ve caved my chest in \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI was a difficult kid too. Take my phone and tv and guess what? I got a wall of books I can slip away into. What\u2019re u gonna do, stop me from reading? (Yes, her answer was yes.)", "Dare I ask...are you a fellow Firefly fan?", "my brothers and I were also mini ninjas\u2026but because of my fathers horrific temper. I\u2019m still quiet as a mouse opening/closing doors, cupboards, etc", "Exactly. And OP has a point to make instead of just being abusive. This just seems to be great, thoughtful parenting to me.", "At one point my mom took what she thought was all my books and locked them in the attic, so that a) I would want to interact with the rest of the family more, and b) getting sent to my room would be an actual punishment.\n\nShe just didn\u2019t realize that half the book collection didn\u2019t fit in my bookcase and was in boxes under my bed.", "That comment was shiny", "Was just going to ask!", "Browncoats!", "I swear by my pretty floral bonnet...", "I'll invite you to the shindig.", "Yes I am 15 years old and yes I am happy to reread The Mouse and the Motorcycle under the covers with a plug-in Christmas decoration for light, tyvm.\n\n*pb-pb-b-b-b*", "My wife and my vow renewal we plan on doing in a few years is going to be a shindig!  Hell, our daughter is Kaylee."]}
