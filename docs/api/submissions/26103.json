We were friends for a little over a year beforehand, and during that first period, his mom loved me, even helped me get a really good job, etc.\r  \n\r  \nIt all changed when we started dating; she even tried to persuade him to not pursue things with me as he was leaving for our first date. Things have been rocky ever since, to say the least. It culminated at our last visit at my in-laws 4 months ago; we were there for my partner\u2019s grandmother\u2019s funerals. (for additional context, we now live together in my home town, which is a 5h drive away from his parents so we don\u2019t visit so often). \r  \n\r  \nOn that occasion, I met for the first time my partner\u2019s extended family. We got back from the funeral with one of his uncle and a cousin of his and were doing some small talk on generic funeral arrangements, when MIL decided to say that I knew a thing or two about funeral arrangements, as my father passed away a few months ago. It took me by surprise, as it is not something I am comfortable talking about, and I immediately saw pity in the uncle\u2019s eye who was looking at me. I had previously mentioned to my MIL that it was a subject that I wanted to bring up myself. I\u2019m still struggling with my father\u2019s death as I didn\u2019t get to say goodbye seeing it was accidental, and I do not want to draw pity eye on me. I kept my thoughts to myself at that moment, but my BF and I discussed about it later that evening as I had been emotionally hurt. \r  \n\r  \nThe next morning, my BF made a remark to his mother while they were alone together about how it was not very nice of her. She didn\u2019t say much then, but when I joined my BF for breakfast, she proceeded to explode at me, yelling that my father\u2019s death was public knowledge, that she had the right to talk about it whenever she wanted, if she wanted to, to who she wanted, that I was basically just trying to pick a fight, and that I was too young to know anything about funeral arrangements, so people would have thought badly of me had she not intervened, picturing herself as the good guy for giving me credentials on the subject. She \u201chad to do it\u201d, she said. My BF and I both tried to calm things down, saying no one was trying to pick a fight and trying to smooth things out, but each time she\u2019d just scream even louder. We left right after that, and I haven\u2019t been there since. \r  \n\r  \nThis is not the first very unpleasant event and things are just getting worse and worse with my MIL. Since it\u2019s 5h away, we always have to sleep there which means it\u2019s always more than just dinner with them. Taking a hotel room would cause more drama, and I don\u2019t need more drama in my life (who does?). I don\u2019t want to go back anymore, I don\u2019t want to go through that kind of things anymore, and my BF won\u2019t force me either (he can always go alone), but I\u2019m still wondering if I\u2019d be an Ahole for not going.

Her reasoning for making the stupid statement about funerals makes absolutely zero sense.\n\neta more \u2014 No No No .... do not suck it up. MIL\u2019s behavior is not okay. Your father has just passed. No one on the planet could ever come up with an acceptable excuse for how her statement was anything but cruel & unkind. Your bf needs to manage his mother & you need to stay far away from that situation.\n\nI\u2019m truly sorry for your loss", "jesus christ, the only one who will be an ass is you BF if he expects you to ever deal with that *apparently* highly instable narc.\nits his mother, ofcourse he shouldnt just go NC but man, whats wrong with her? was she like this with previous gfs? there are moms where no girl is ever good enough for her baby boys.\n\nthat being said, while you WNBTA never talking or meeting her again, you will certainly be the opposite for trying to be good family for his other relatives.\n\ntalking about the uncle, apparently he knows that there is something wrong with her.\n\nand finally. sorry for your loss", "NTA.\n\nAnd since you're writing and viewing this together, for the b/f: I'd refuse to see your mom until she apologizes and promises to act with better behavior.  Failure to do so would be LC/NC from me.  Disrespecting someone like that is unacceptable.", "It sounds like your MIL does not approve of you as a match for her son. For whatever reason. She will continue to peck. If your BF can handle the divide than roll with that. Peace is worth it. \n\n\nMy MIL is manipulative and has problems with honesty, after being burned over a particularly bad christmas eve she is no longer allowed  to sleep in our home, when she came to visit after the birth of our youngest she had to get a hotel, and only visited while I was at work. \n\nI readily admit I am an asshole here for not being a doormat in the name of family tranquility. But it is necessary. \n\nThis only \"works\" as my SO understands this issue and helps hold the line. She also appreciates that she can use me as cover, \"bad cop\" to keep a measure of control over the situation for herself.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to go to be treated like that.", "MIL might have been making poor choices because of her grief over the death in the family, and then saying indiscrete things. When called out, she had to double down to save face?  But this is not an isolated incident, it's just furthering a classroom of disrespect and hostility from her.\n\nYWNBTA if you stayed away, but somewhere down the road she may want to apologize and do better. Or she might even pretend nothing happened, but still try to do better. If that time ever comes, it would probably be a good idea to give her a chance. In the meantime, there's no reason to make your life less nice because she's got issues.", "No, YWNBTA, and good for your BF for backing you up.  There's no way I would ever visit again, especially knowing she's bipolar, & off her medication. And I have to wonder if she's going through menopause too!!  You absolutely should not be around her.  My dad was bipolar & I stayed away when he didn't take his meds because of the verbal & emotional abuse he would dish out, it was horrible.", "NTA and I\u00b4m really sorry for your loss.  \n\n\nGlad your bf has your back on this. Her remark was just unvcalled for and cruel. How can\u00b4t a 27yo be educated about funeral arrangements? By 27 I had been to several already, including my grandparents and their siblings'. Her leashing out so bad just tells, that she felt caught and immediately got defensive.\n\nNo one (but her) can tell why her behaviour towards you changed so much after dating her son. Maybe it\u00b4s the long distance and you \"taking him away\" from her.\n\nIn my eyes you are not the AH if you don\u00b4t go there anymore, but personally probably would at least try being there once or twice a year to not get my partner into trouble with his family, esp. since he\u00b4s shown you he\u00b4s on your side. IF the \"taking away\" is the reason for her resentment it would be fuel to the fire. I find it hard at times to deal with petty ILs, but it\u00b4s something I can endure for a weekend or two per year to show my partner the same support as he shows me. Good luck!", "Stay home. MIL is nasty and insensitive. Everything she said to you is wrong. For some reason, she began hating  you when you started dating her little boy. She is just a MIL. There is no reason to ever see her again. If she asks why, I would really let her have it!!!!!!", "I vote you go with your boyfriend for the road trip and then you stay at a hotel until he is done with his visit. Nobody needs to be spending extra time with her to sleep over.

Ever.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  You made it clear the subject of your father\u2019s passing was off limits and she is out of line.  You refer to her as your MIL, when in fact, she is not.  You should stop doing that until you are officially her DIL.  I wouldn\u2019t return to anyone\u2019s home that yelled at me, but that\u2019s me.  Avoid what you can with his mother and if you can\u2019t, be tight-lipped.  Your silence will drive her crazy.", "NTA\n\nYou say she yelled at you that\n> that I was basically just trying to pick a fight\n\nThis is called projection and she is *obviously* the one \"just trying to pick a fight\" because that's exactly what she's doing. \n\nINFO: Do you think she has a problem with the age difference?\n\nThree years isn't so much but it is in one's early 20s.", "Nope...NTA go NC immediately. It is honestly the best thing ever...my in-laws are abusive as well and leaving them behind us the best thing I ever did.", "NTA, I haven't seen my out of state in laws for years (and it's great).

Then when called out and double down just shows who she is. Good for ur bf to call her out and in the proper way. \n\n\nSadly, you just not going and your bf still going will not help. She is getting what she wants. Her son without you. He need to go no contact until she apologizes to you and stops her toxic actions. Your bf need to make it clear you are a package deal.
