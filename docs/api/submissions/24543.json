His parents did not take too kindly to the announcement. While I am unsure of the specifics, Jacob has since left his parents' home. Though I am also told that his parents did not kick him out. For the last 4 days he's been sleeping on Sabrina's couch. Sabrina's room mates, while sympathetic to the situation, have raised that their place cannot be a long term housing solution for Jacob.\n\n**The Conflict:**\n\nAs I'm the only member of my family (at least in my generation) that owns his own home, I've been receiving a lot of pressure from Sabrina to extend my home to Jacob. I'm reluctant to house Jacob temporarily, let alone be Jacob's long term housing solution.\n\nTo be frank, I have never got along with Jacob. I want to make clear that my opinions of him has nothing to do with his transition; I disliked him before then too. He just carries himself with a thick \"holier than thou\" attitude, often attacking various members of our family for choices that don't align with his narrow world view. Just recently Jacob accosted me at our family Christmas dinner, unprovoked, to critique me about my career choices.\n\nWhile that's the primary reason I rather not house Jacob, there's another major concern: Jacob just isn't a functional adult. He's studying his umpteenth degree after dropping out too many degrees for me to remember. Which would be fine if he had a source of income. But, despite being the ripe old age of 26, he has not worked a day in his life. He doesn't have a car; nor does he know how to drive. And I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't know how cook or clean either.\n\n**Am I the asshole?**\n\nLook, I sympathise with Jacob. It's wrong of his parents to make him feel unwelcomed in their home. But surely that doesn't obligate me \u2014 someone that has a tenuous relationship at best with him \u2014 to house Jacob, right? As far as I am aware his parents didn't kick him out of the home. So it's not like my refusal to house Jacob would render him homeless. That isn't the popular opinion amongst my cousins. But it's easy for them to preach from their ivory towers when none of them are in a position to house Jacob. So that's why I'm seeking more objective opinions.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1691931292, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15py6tp/aita_for_refusing_to_house_my_cousin_who_left_his/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My understanding is that he wasn't kicked out, but nevertheless feel unwelcome in his parents' home. My extended family are pressuring me to extend my home to Jacob. But I am reluctant to do so, given that I don't have a great relationship with Jacob. Why that action might make me an asshole is because, as my extended family has put it, there is an obligation that family let bygones be bygones and help each other out in a time of need. \\\n\nWhat's your take?\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ### [Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s your house, and you get to choose who lives with you. Jacob willingly chose to leave his home, knowing he had nowhere to go. At 26, he should have been working at least part time and saving money to move out on his own. His option now is to get a full-time job and find his own place to live or return to his parents house. Not your circus, not your monkeys, just keep telling yourself that.", "I want to say NTA. If he is in school he should be able to get a student loan. Jacob can also get a part-time job if he wants to live on his own. It\u2019s nice that your cousin is housing him temporarily and the pressure from roommates should help him to find his own place. It seems you don\u2019t really like Jacob so it\u2019s probably not the best place for him to live right now. Especially when he is trying to find himself in this new chapter of his life. If Jacob doesn\u2019t want his own place then you have every right to be worried about Jacob staying long term.", "NTA. First it\u2019s your house ONLY YOU decide who can come and stay. Second he don\u2019t get along with him you have no obligation to make sure yourself uncomfortable for someone else. Third anyone criticizing you for not wanting to do it tell them to take him in then since they are so bothered by it.", "NAH. I don't think your cousins are wrong to ask if you would be willing to house him but you are not an AH for saying no. If I'm understanding correctly, he has options available to him. It sounds like he wasnt kicked out but I imagine it's not a good place for him mentally. If he's in school he can apply for student loans which can be used to help covering housing. Universities also often have emergency housing and funds for situations like this.\n\nCritiquing your career choice while never having worked himself,  good grief.\n\nIf you do agree to house him temporarily i would directly state some very clear boundaries and limits on his stay there, for both of your sakes. You don't want a permenant roommate and you don't want to give him false hope about how long he can stay. Good luck OP!", "Nta. Sounds like a nightmare roommate situation. Jacob can take responsibility for himself and find his own housing", "NTA. It sucks that Jacobs parents are assholes. But Jacob was an asshole to you historically. That isn't magically erased since he came out.", "NTA\n\nIt's sad that the world has come to such a place of inclusiveness that we are afraid to say \"I don't like you\" to someone who is different than us because we are afraid of the backlash it can come with. \n\nIt's ok to not like someone because of their personality, because of the way they treat you and others, and if they just have different interests and you don't get along. It's not ok to hate / treat someone poorly because of their sexual orientation, skin color, religion, or anything else.", "NTA. He's a grown adult and can house himself. The fact that he apparently is incapable of being an adult is not your problem. In fact, I wouldn't touch this with a ten foot pole, otherwise you'd basically be fulfilling a parental role. If the rest of the family keeps pushing you, suggest that they band together and contribute to helping him rent his own place. Don't let them coerce you into doing this, otherwise you'll just grow to resent him more and more - and if you think their judgment of you is bad now, imagine what it's going to be like when you have to kick him out and actually make him homeless.", "NTA, it would be a nice thing to do, if you have the ability, but you're in no way obligated to.", "Nta. \n\nJust because you own a house doesn't mean you are a hotel for every runaway family member.  \n\nHe's also not homeless. His parents didn't kick him out. He left on his own freewill.   If he can't afford to live on his own or with roommates.  Go back home.", "Info: how much of his jerk behavior do you attribute to being unhappily gendered?", "NTA. You have legitimate reasons for not wanting to house your cousin. And at 26, he is capable of supporting himself. This isn\u2019t a case of a teenager being kicked out of the house. And, let\u2019s be honest, temporary roommates too often become permanent ones simply because once they get in, they are really difficult to get out, as Sabrina is discovering. \n\nBasically, Sabrina is pressuring you because she\u2019s discoverer how difficult it is to get rid of a temporary roommate and sees you as the easiest way to shift the problem to another person.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
