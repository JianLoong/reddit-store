It\u2019s a long story, but ultimately he didn\u2019t feel very safe living there without the other roommates who were gone over Christmas. I allowed him to live in my spare bedroom for a month and never asked for anything toward heating or rent. I also would cook quite regularly and always offered him something. To my memory, he never thanked me and he also never said anything like, \u2018hey, let me cook you something,\u2019 or \u2018you got groceries last time, let me get them this time.\u2019 Then his roommate came back and I had to go away for a bit for work. I asked that he move out that week, preferably sooner rather than later. He agreed he would move out on Wednesday. Wednesday came and went and he didn\u2019t leave. Then it was Thursday. He finally moved out on Saturday when I was out, no \u2018goodbye\u2019, no \u2018thank you\u2019. \n\nIt took a little while and we returned to a sort of normalcy, but we never spoke about it. However, the more we hung out, the more I realised he takes advantage. For example, if one of our other pals is over, he\u2019ll have them ask if it\u2019s okay for him to come over. Often I do tea, coffee, and cake. Sometimes he\u2019s even managed to stay over for dinner this way by being grandfathered in. Additionally when we go out, our friends buy rounds. Never in my life has he bought me a drink. Not once, but he happily accepts them. \n\nA few months ago when my partner and I were on vacation, he got in touch and tried to get free legal advice out of my mother (who is a lawyer). She gave him some, but, again, never so much as a \u2018thank you\u2019.\n\nLately, I have cooled on him. I find him to be entitled and difficult and it\u2019s not really worth the occasional joke he makes that lands. He has, however, started \u2018seeing\u2019 one of my best friends. I invited her to my upcoming Thanksgiving, but made it clear it was a small gathering this year and she was one of the few. I have not yet broached the subject that he\u2019s not invited, though he is American too and we live abroad. My mother said I wasn\u2019t being kind and my partner also seems a bit disappointed in me. I just don\u2019t think my \u2018friend\u2019 would even appreciate the effort that goes into it and I am trying to actively distance myself from them.\n\nETA: My two friends are not a couple. They are \u2018hanging out,\u2019 though we\u2019re all in our late twenties/ early thirties and categorically too old for that. They were, however, close friends before they began \u2018hanging out\u2019 and she has also noted his tendency to be a mooch. Apparently they have spoken about it and he acknowledged it, though I have not seen or heard of him correcting this behaviour.

You have shown amazing kindness to this person and received dead stares in return. I would not longer want to be friends with this person. Why do they feel you must continue to give him things. NTA.", "Yeah, it also seems like a bit of a pointless endeavour for me to broach it if my pal genuinely has and he never corrected this behaviour.", "Oh, to clarify, they are not a couple. They seem to be hanging out, but I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s taken her on a date. \n\nI did, however, tell her that my partner and I are only inviting 4 people over each (for a total of 10) and that I was really excited she was one of my 4!", "Fair enough.", "This should be made clear in the original post. NTA. He's a mooch.", "This is nonsense. Yes you can. You can invite whenever you\u2019d like to your events. If your friend who he\u2019s seeing doesn\u2019t want to come without him,  that\u2019s her prerogative. NTA", "You\u2019re right. Will edit for clarification\u2019s sake.", "OP-have you point blank told her to not bring him ? It sounds like you are depending on her math ability .", "NTA- this guy just isn't your friend. You should stop inviting him to things.", "I think its time you had a private conversation with this friend.  He may be one of those clueless dumbasses who knows no better or thinks his hang-out buddy is wrong.  You have to explain to him that invitations to friends are about reciprocity.  It has nothing to do with money, but it would be great if he invited you to his house for some pizza and a beer.   Or he sent your mom a muffin basket to thank her for her advice, or if he brought a bottle of wine.  After the conversation, if he gets very defensive tell him that the friend invitations will start to dwindle and he will no longer be invited to everything.  Then teach by example, until you have had enough.  To me, Thanksgiving is the one time of year where we don't deny anyone a meal.  Just saying.", "Your \"friend\" is a moocher. It's Thanksgiving for 10. That's 4 people you each get to invite. Definitely NTA. Let your actual friend know that it's invitation only because you have limited space and food so no room for surprise guest.", "NTA - it would be a little ironic to invite a person who is never thankful for anything anyone does for them.", "NTA but if you have never talked to him about this then he may not realize there is a problem. He cannot read your mind, so _you need to talk to HIM about it not everybody but him_ . For him the situation is the same as before so he is clueless that anything needs to change in your relationship. You need to educate him that the situation has changed.", "NTA, but I think it's time for SOMEBODY to be honest with this friend.\n\nTell him that you are hurt that he never thanked you for housing him for a month, and he also never once paid for anything, and that's just not how friends should treat their host.\n\nIf you want, let him come to Thanksgiving but give him a list of things he HAS to bring, such as wine and beer.", "If it was a single month of him living there that would be one thing, but you describe basically years of being friendly and little favors here and there and he never even says thanks. \"Thanks\" is like the bare minimum politeness back he was required to do. I doubt you'd even have noticed if he had thrown a thanks your way.\n\nNTA If she asks if she can bring anyone say no. It might be a nonissue if she never even asks.", "YTA because it sounds like OP really needs to work on boundaries and communication, instead of building resentment against someone, going cold and excluding them all of a sudden. \n\nMaybe he is just a mooch, maybe he is embarrassed about his situation, maybe he has some kind of ND and communicates differently. I have no idea. But there are so many times in this post where OP offers something, he accepts, and then because he doesn\u2019t appear to be grateful enough to OP\u2019s own personal standards, OP feels indignant. I don\u2019t like a mooch either, but remember that nobody can read our minds and we have the choice to stop offering and to set boundaries long before it gets to this point. \n\nThe \u201cfree legal advice\u201d really rubs me the wrong way, too. Was she pressured into this meeting in some way? Or did he just ask for a favour and she said yes? Why would someone be expected to pay for that? Where I\u2019m from you can call a lawyer and get a free consultation anyways, but it\u2019s written as if it\u2019s this enormous thing they did for him.", "NTA.  You can broach it once.  May if nothing rose make it easier to set boundaries.", "My mother and I have kind of a fraught relationship so I try not to use her as a weather vane too much, but from my partner\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s Thanksgiving, he\u2019s American and lives abroad, and therefore he meets the general requirements. Also, I believe my partner is incredibly generous and he seems to shake stuff like this off. He was upset with how this person treated me after staying there a month, but now that things have returned to normal he thinks that they should, well, return to normal.", "Right, so I actually told her yesterday, \u2018Oh, also, just a heads up - please don\u2019t mention Thanksgiving to X. I don\u2019t want him to feel excluded. It\u2019s just that we don\u2019t have the space.\u2019 \n\nShe then said something along the lines of \u2018I hope they have other plans that evening so it won\u2019t come up,\u2019 followed by \u2018who else will I know?\u2019, and then, something along the lines of \u2018I feel unworthy, are you sure you wouldn\u2019t rather invite (insert name of another friend).\u2019", "Thank you - you\u2019ve made a lot of good points. The reason I haven\u2019t approached him about it sooner is because I do think he\u2019s aware of his behaviours and simply doesn\u2019t care to correct them.", "I have done this, thank you for your input.", "I will bring it up next time I see him. Truthfully, I have started to create distance because I very much felt like I\u2019ve been taken advantage of.", "Thank you, I will consider doing this!", "Genuinely, I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve noticed if there had been a \u2018thank you\u2019 here or there.", "He is probably still find a way to show if you do not make it extremely clear. Extremely.", "I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s taken her on a date. That would require him to spend his own money, no?", "I suspect what will happen is we\u2019ll get closer to the date and she\u2019ll ask if she can bring him."]}
