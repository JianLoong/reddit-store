It\u2019s a long story, but ultimately he didn\u2019t feel very safe living there without the other roommates who were gone over Christmas. I allowed him to live in my spare bedroom for a month and never asked for anything toward heating or rent. I also would cook quite regularly and always offered him something. To my memory, he never thanked me and he also never said anything like, \u2018hey, let me cook you something,\u2019 or \u2018you got groceries last time, let me get them this time.\u2019 Then his roommate came back and I had to go away for a bit for work. I asked that he move out that week, preferably sooner rather than later. He agreed he would move out on Wednesday. Wednesday came and went and he didn\u2019t leave. Then it was Thursday. He finally moved out on Saturday when I was out, no \u2018goodbye\u2019, no \u2018thank you\u2019. \n\nIt took a little while and we returned to a sort of normalcy, but we never spoke about it. However, the more we hung out, the more I realised he takes advantage. For example, if one of our other pals is over, he\u2019ll have them ask if it\u2019s okay for him to come over. Often I do tea, coffee, and cake. Sometimes he\u2019s even managed to stay over for dinner this way by being grandfathered in. Additionally when we go out, our friends buy rounds. Never in my life has he bought me a drink. Not once, but he happily accepts them. \n\nA few months ago when my partner and I were on vacation, he got in touch and tried to get free legal advice out of my mother (who is a lawyer). She gave him some, but, again, never so much as a \u2018thank you\u2019.\n\nLately, I have cooled on him. I find him to be entitled and difficult and it\u2019s not really worth the occasional joke he makes that lands. He has, however, started \u2018seeing\u2019 one of my best friends. I invited her to my upcoming Thanksgiving, but made it clear it was a small gathering this year and she was one of the few. I have not yet broached the subject that he\u2019s not invited, though he is American too and we live abroad. My mother said I wasn\u2019t being kind and my partner also seems a bit disappointed in me. I just don\u2019t think my \u2018friend\u2019 would even appreciate the effort that goes into it and I am trying to actively distance myself from them.\n\nETA: My two friends are not a couple. They are \u2018hanging out,\u2019 though we\u2019re all in our late twenties/ early thirties and categorically too old for that. They were, however, close friends before they began \u2018hanging out\u2019 and she has also noted his tendency to be a mooch. Apparently they have spoken about it and he acknowledged it, though I have not seen or heard of him correcting this behaviour.
