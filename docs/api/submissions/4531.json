She is adopted and black, me and her father are white. She is a brilliant girl who is smart and is hoping to one day be a doctor. \n\nMed schools have a massive amount of background checks, and probably won\u2019t accept you if you are charged with a crime, sometimes they will even reject you because you got arrested, even if you aren\u2019t charged. \n\nFurther context, the police in our area are insanely racist. For reference, one time when my daughter was 12, she called the cops because of a suspected break-in in our home. My daughter has a \u201cwhite girl\u201d accent so when the cops arrived, they arrested the 12 year old black girl and claimed they assumed the resident who called was white. \n\nMy daughter was at a high school party at our friend\u2019s house. One of her friends, who is the daughter of one of my friends (we\u2019ll call her Maddie), was grounded and supposed to be at home. Maddie\u2019s daughter snuck out and went to the party, which made Maddie furious enough to call the cops on the party. Maddie knew my daughter was at the party. \n\nI get Maddie\u2019s frustration but I thought that was too far, and told her not to call the cops, explaining that while they will probably let the other girls (all of them are white) off easy, they will fuck up my daughter for sure. \n\nGuess what, Maddie called the cops on a noise complaint, and my daughter was arrested, and held in jail for 3 days as this was a weekend. I\u2019m not a lawyer and still in the process of getting one but isn\u2019t that illegal? \n\nThey have also informed me that they want to charge my daughter with 3 misdemeanours, disorderly conduct for noisiness, simple assault because the girls were play wrestling when the cops walked in, and indecent exposure because my daughter was wearing an outfit that showed her stomach. \n\nMy daughter is distraught because I\u2019m pretty sure (pls correct if wrong) this will go on her record, even though she hasn\u2019t and hopefully won\u2019t be convicted. This will 100% impact all her medical school apps in the future and will probably ruin her chances of going to an ivy league school now. \n\nI saw Maddie when shopping the next day and while she apologised I just blew up. I lost it, I was screaming at her until I physically couldn\u2019t anymore, she\u2019s likely ruined my daughter\u2019s life. And the worst part is even after her husband told her she was wrong she is still saying she was right in calling the cops, not getting that life is different for a black girl. \n\nEveryone heard about my outburst and some are telling me that Maddie feels terrible, and I shouldn\u2019t have yelled at her, she was doing what was best for her kid. \n\nAITA?AITA for blowing up at a woman for calling the cops?", "created_utc": 1670828951, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zjquhs/aita_for_blowing_up_at_a_woman_for_calling_the/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The police are the issue here.", "YTA, het here's a thought for the 21st century- since you knew she was calling the police, YOU could have called YOUR daughter & told her to GTFO! Wow! Amazing then she wouldn't be arrested!\n\nThe rest, if true, you need legal advice for, not screaming at people. Would have been funny if you got arrested too!", " YTA. Are you going to explode at every person who calls the cops anytime your daughter is present? \n\nLet me eta: depending on your state and you really need to look it up because each state is different, juvenile records can be expunged, are automatically expunged at a certain age, etc. There are exceptions of course and again, please look into the specifics of the state you live in. \n\nAlso, it isn't healthy to scream at people. Your daughter is already in a tough spot. You can help her be stronger as a result of the crap that comes her way (fair or not) or you can teach her to buckle and fold because of her skin color.\n\nBefore anyone comes at me let me just add that my kids are biracial. The oldest is 25 and the youngest is 14. My point? We've been there. We've done all of it and learned some extremely valuable lessons along the way.", "YTA. \u201cYou should never call the cops to report illegal activity because there MAY be a black person there, and they might get arrested\u201d is not a legitimate thing to say, ever. If your daughter is not convicted, then her record would show that the charges were dropped. Indecent exposure has nothing to do with showing your stomach, much less inside of a house party. Assault would require a victim, so if it was play fighting then there would not be a victim statement and therefor no crime committed. You need to get a lawyer, and yes even on weekends they can get you out of jail. This post honestly sounds kind of made up because of how absurd it is that a 16 year old would be arrested for \u2026 not much of anything. There is no court in the world where your daughter would be found guilty.", "Sorry but this post is not real", "ESH\n\nMaddie for calling the cops and getting other kids in trouble, instead of just picking up her own daughter.\n\nYou for taking the risk and not fetching your daughter or calling her to go home despite already getting the heads up Maddie could do something stupid. \n\nThe cops for being racist AHs.

I don't blame Maddie for not understanding - I don't understand this story either.  I live in a liberal city.  If my kid snuck away to a party where I thought illegal activity was going on, I might call the cops too.\n\n>I saw Maddie when shopping the next day and while she apologised I just blew up. I lost it, I was screaming at her until I physically couldn\u2019t anymore, she\u2019s likely ruined my daughter\u2019s life. \n\nNo.  It was the racist cops that \"ruined\" your daughter's life (if it's even ruined - you don't think Ive League schools understand things like racial discrimination?  Your kid could probably make this her entrance essay.)  You don't get to scream at people who AREN'T the problem.  You come off as unhinged.\n\n>she was doing what was best for her kid. \n\nHere's the thing.  Maddie's primary responsibility is HER kid.  Not yours.  If you were really that worried about what might happen, why didn't you call your daughter and tell her to come home?  Tell her that Maddie's mom was worried and about to call the police, and you didn't want her mixed in the middle of it.\n\nAs for the police...  well.  There are no words for how much they suck.  But you can't go around screaming like a banshee at everyone who doesn't see the world the way you do.", "If this true you need to move with your child to a town with less racism. \n\nI actually can\u2019t believe they could do this to a minor child and leave all the other girls there!", "YTA. First off, there is no excuse for you to still be in the process of getting a lawyer. Your kid was arrested, apparently days ago, so quit dragging your heels. If you keep going off on people in public, sooner or later you will need a lawyer to defend you, too. You do your kid no favors in the court of public opinion by screaming & yelling in public. \n\nSecond, your belief that no one should ever call the cops because it might have a bad impact on your daughter is ridiculous. People can & will call the cops in many situations. If you want to protect your high school daughter, tell her to avoid rowdy parties, especially one where it appears there are no adults present to keep the noise down & talk to the cops if they show up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
