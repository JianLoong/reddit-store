Things were fine for the first 2 months, and we seemed to be adjusting to living together pretty well.\n\nThe problem is in the past month or two, Vivian has been threatening to move back to her city whenever I do something without her for more than 10-20 minutes in our apartment.\n\nGetting work done in the living room? She'll go back to her city.  On Zoom call for work? She'll go back.  Trying to meal prep? You guessed it, she'll go back to her city.\n\nI've had conversations with her about these type of threats and Vivian will promise to not do it anymore, but the next day she'll threaten to leave again.\n\nYesterday night, I was rewatching the Hunger Game movies since I had time off and because of the prequel coming out. I spaced it out and I was watching the last two films.\n\nVivian had done it with part 1 and brushed her off, assuming she wouldn't say anything again.\n\nI was maybe 20 minutes into mockingjay part 2 when Vivian comes down and says \" You know, I can just leave for \"cityname.\" \n\nI paused the movie, sighed, and said \" Go ahead, maybe it'll be good for you.\"  \n\nVivian looked shocked at my response and immediately accused me of not caring about her. I tried to explain that wasn't the case and I just gotten sick of her threatening to leave whenever I did something without her. \n\nVivian refused to listen and instead left for her mom's place, cursing me on her way out.\n\nI got a few texts from her friends calling me an asshole for telling her to leave, and I asked my own friends about it.\n\nSome say that I was right for telling her that, and the others say that I shouldn't said that and instead talked to Vivian about it again.", "created_utc": 1700207266, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17x9zmj/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_she_can_go_ahead/", "score": 229, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You said you would have done it anyway because you wanted it, too, but *she* made the decision.  Now she doesn't like you doing things without her and threatens to leave anytime you do something solo, even in the house.\n\nThe thing that makes me feel like something is being left out (whether it makes you an AH or not) is theres a huuuuge difference between meal prep or working and watching 2 long-ass movies marathon style.  I'm not saying you're wrong for doing that last one, but that's 4+ hours of movie watching.\n\nQuestions: Is the meal prep for her, too?  Regardless, could she help with it so you're spending the time together?  What do you do together?  Is the amount of time you spend together comparable to the time you spend working/doing things solo?  Do you have a healthy work/life balance?  I ask because you're only 6 months into living together, and it can be hard to go from flying solo to having to consider another person.  It happens in relationships but also even after having children.  (I speak from experience.

She\u2019s in a new city, it\u2019s a new relationship, she doesn\u2019t have her usual support network nearby.. etc. She is probably uncertain, and a bit lonely, and it\u2019s manifesting itself as this needy behaviour. She\u2019s essentially \u201ctesting\u201d your dedication to her by making these threats, in order to make sure you do still love her/value her/want her - because you\u2019re all she feels like she\u2019s got, and she made this huge change to be with you. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean her behaviour is okay. Far from it. But, there\u2019s a chance she doesn\u2019t really know what she\u2019s doing and is just flailing around like a big insecure mess (we\u2019re all capable of it!).\n\nSo.. if you sit her down for one more talk about the problem, but this time frame it as: \u201cI\u2019m worried about you, you don\u2019t seem very happy or secure here.. what can I do to help?\u201d You might be able to work around the problem. Tell her you love being with her but you can\u2019t be with her every second of the day, and that you recognise she\u2019s probably a bit bored/lonely. And maybe help her come up with a plan to make her feel more at home/find some local friends/hobbies etc.\n\nIf you give that approach a good shot - together - and she still doesn\u2019t cut it out, you might have to consider suggesting that she moves back home.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
