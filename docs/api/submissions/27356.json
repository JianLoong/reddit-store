You have prioritized her and continue to do so, there is NOTHING WRONG with you wanting one day to go do something fun with your own friends-- especially when six other people are counting on you. This codependency is really unhealthy for all of you and she's only going to get worse once the baby is here.\n\nShe needs therapy. Big time. Some couples therapy might also be a good idea for you two. Until then, you need to set firm boundaries with her and stand up for yourself.

My girlfriend was like this too, but never once did I have to cancel plans for her.  I'd ask and she'd reassure me that while she is sad she hopes I have and to stay as long as I want.  If I tried to cancel she practically would force me to go because she didn't want her feelings to get in the way of normal and healthy behavior.  Even if she isnt doing it intentionally Its troubling that it's every time you go anywhere you're being made to feel guilty, that is not healthy or fair to you.\n\nI just want to clarify I don't think your wife is malicious, I don't like using the word manipulate here because of the negative connotation.  To Me it seems to be an act of desperation and one she knows that works.  Please discuss possible therapy.  She is completely dependent on you and can't find happiness within herself.", "YTA\n\nYou described 0 codependency. Instead you described yourself as resentful of the time you guys are together and you feel spending time with her takes away from your independence. Seeing your friends is normal but obviously when expecting a baby, things change. You can\u2019t expect your life to stay the same. \n\nMaybe you\u2019re not fit for WFH but working together at home is not quality time spent together. The time afterwards, is usually spent unwinding, making/eating dinner, getting ready for bed. That\u2019s not great time together as well. \n\nWhy did you choose to have a baby? Having a a baby is the definition of a codependent relationship with your child. Do you think a pregnant person needs their partner more or less? And postpartum? How will you be splitting parenting? \n\nWhat solution have you been working on with your pregnant wife?

The comment about your daughter does sound manipulative to me. I hear you that you spend a lot of time with her on the days you work, but it\u2018s probably not the same quality of time as you are probably not as relaxed after a day\u2019s work. So I don\u2019t blame her for wanting some time with you on your day off. As it sounds like you only have 2 days off a month in common, I think you should spend a good part of those days having some quality time with her. There\u2019s nothing wrong with you needing to get out of the house and socialize. But perhaps a many hours long DND quest is a lot to ask when you have such limited time. My opinion is that you shouldn\u2019t have committed to it in the first place. Too bad for those people, your wife should come first. But you should still get out for an hour or two and socialize. I\u2019m going to go with an ESH. You shouldn\u2019t have committed to such an involved social activity when your time together is so limited.

I don\u2019t play in person often (it\u2019s only happened 3 times in a year) and she is also a member of this group and actually has an in person session in 3 days without me in it. \n\nFor parenting split I\u2019ll be taking the reins for much of the early childhood because due to my mom being a single parent and working 3 jobs I was the main at home caretaker for my siblings for the first ~3 years of both of their lives and she doesn\u2019t have much experience with babies, I\u2019m entirely aware of the amount a child depends on a parent. Not only will we both be stepping back from our d&d group during our PPL leave and then indefinitely as we readjust. I\u2019ll be taking over around the house, the care of the baby as far as diapers etc and the pets for the first 6 weeks as she does the 2 weeks in bed 2 weeks on bed 2 weeks around to help with the risk of PPD\n\nBut even with your plethora of questions it doesn\u2019t seem like the answers matter you\u2019re just assuming I\u2019m out every night \u201changing with the boys\u201d and she\u2019s needing to parent me. \n\nAs far as what solution? If you mean for this issue I told her today to not knee jerk reaction tell me what she thought vis-a-vis me going to the session and once she had some time to ruminate on it let me know what she thought.", "Haha yeah! fuck people who enjoy hanging out with friends and have interests! Let\u2019s go kick a nerd, grab a brew, and talk about how we peaked in high school! \n\nDon\u2019t call me son man, I wrestled and played football on top of theatre, band, and d&d. and based on your performative bullshit I can assume I likely had a lot more luck with women that you ever would because I actually have confidence in who I am and what I like.", "We communicate quite a bit about our issues yes and we\u2019ve had conversations about her feelings regarding me doing things that don\u2019t involve her and she agrees she has these issues, now 3000 characters doesn\u2019t really give space to encapsulate a full person so I understand where you\u2019re coming from but for nearly 9 years this has been something she\u2019s struggled with in general. \n\nI once again will state clearly my wife is **not** manipulative. She just isn\u2019t. Her biggest fear is being seen as such because she can\u2019t hide emotions well and my first instinct is always to change everything I am doing will do and have done to fix any negative emotion she might feel. (Which is my own unhealthy shit I\u2019m aware) I respect the core of what you\u2019re saying but you\u2019re taking some leaps here.\n\nCodependency is how her therapist has classified her behavior she\u2019s aware of it. I\u2019m definitely not about to share her traumas or our deeper feelings issues and interrelationship workings on Reddit \n\nJealous has multiple meanings and they\u2019re not all bad in this context jealous of her time is referring to being very protective over, and it\u2019s not a negative just a fact\n\nI of course don\u2019t feel she\u2019s not able to have emotions or that it\u2019s wrong, right now with the 2 pound ball of hormones in her stomach she\u2019s nothing but emotions and I do everything I can to make sure she\u2019s feeling the positive ones. however also have them.\n\nI agree working together isn\u2019t quality time. But every day after work we do spend quality time together, for instance currently I\u2019m laying in bed with her watching master chef until she falls asleep so my packing boxes won\u2019t take away from my time with her. I cherish my time with my wife heavily, which is why I spend so much with her, which is why I bristle at being met with negative emotions when I other plans happen. \n\nAssuming negative intent behind this post is strange to me. I\u2019m not coming in here to shit talk my wife I wanted peoples views on a situation I\u2019m in", "I apologize, might have written a novel based on defensive emotional response here. The language of your comment is a bit presumptive and negative. When I saw \u201cyou blame her\u201d I started to get a little heated. I don\u2019t mind being called TA here but I don\u2019t enjoy seeing that how I\u2019ve written the post makes it seem like I\u2019m trying to paint her in a negative light. Frankly if I wouldn\u2019t get banned I\u2019d delete it at this point there\u2019s been some good insights that I appreciate on the situation but I hate seeing people who don\u2019t know her say she\u2019s manipulative because I phrased this poorly. Going from 6k characters to 3k lost a lot of my original intent I think", "I'm glad you guys are working on it together.  I do have to point out something obvious though.\n\nYou knew how she was going into the marriage.  No matter what you post regarding her issues on codependency, you are fully aware of the person you married in this regards, and what you were getting into.\n\nI understand explaining her issues here, but if you are genuinely expecting people to say \"Sure, she's too clingy, overbearing, needy, etc. , go play DnD\", that's a little dishonest.  I would compare that to marrying a sober alcoholic and then wondering why can't I ever leave beer in the fridge?\n\nAlso from personal experience, most pregnant women need support much more than when they were not carrying.  It might not be a codependency thing, rather I'm vulnerable and want my husband with me kind of thing.\n\nCongrats on the baby though!", "I think you going off and doing other things when you two have just moved is kind of a jerk move. There's undoubtedly a lot of unpacking and so on to do still, and your wife is now heavily pregnant, which limits what she may be able to do or feel comfortable doing.", "Because she\u2019s very pregnant, and lifting/unpacking boxes wouldn\u2019t be recommended", "Not time to time, in general. Of course she'll be alone with it most of the time since OP's working. Most likely she'll do the majority of the duties. She just needs to be sure that when OP's needed because the kid gets suddenly feverish, he'll be there and driving them to the hospital and not playing dnd somewhere with his phone turned off. That is what it boils down to: the wife must be sure that OP will have his priorities right, after the kid's born.", "Lol, then I take it back. You're still risking a quarrel \ud83e\udd2d\ud83d\ude04", "working together is not the same as spending quality time together.", "Deep breath man, lighten up.", "Not the same an alcoholic that doesn\u2019t drink can\u2019t have alcohol around because it temps them to fall into bad habits. \n\nThe wife is working on her codependency so OP is allowed to expect to see some progress.", "I appreciate it! We\u2019re very excited!!\n\nI definitely knew who I married yeah and what I was getting into. Frankly I\u2019m a home body so I don\u2019t mind too much of the possessive stuff I think it comes down to with me the rarity of wanting to be out making it more of a sore spot when I do. I can count the number of times I\u2019ve left the house the last 3 months not for groceries on one hand. I posted genuinely wanting insight from people on the situation, definitely not to demonize her or make myself look good. So far there\u2019s been a lot of thoughtful comments which I\u2019ve appreciated", "Oh yeah 100% he could either consciously or subconsciously be trying to skirt around doing his share of the work which will be heavier since she is pregnant and has to put the health of her and the baby first.", "No but we\u2019re both off by 6 and spend the night together playing games watching shows etc etc, I highly value quality time with my wife", "I think your feelings of not wanting to feel guilty every time you do something without her are valid. I just think you\u2019re picking the wrong time to stand your ground so to speak. Her being pregnant and wanting to spend time with you in your new home especially considering how stressful a move is, are completely valid reasons to want you there. It sucks that it affects your campaign. But it is what it is. The reality is you would be leaving your pregnant wife at home in the first week of living in a new home. I think it\u2019s fair that she wants you around to get settled. Especially considering she likely can\u2019t do much herself in her condition."]}
