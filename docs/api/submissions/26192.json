That you are Rosie's dad, that she knows it and loves you and picked you, both for herself and Seb.\n\nAnd the fact that SEB wants you to dance with him, too, while John doesn't give a flip about him only proves that he doesn't care about Rosie.

I have to admit that I was concerned when I read the post\u2019s title, but almost immediately I understood what you were dealing with.  Sure, bragging might have been a tad childish, but it\u2019s certainly justified here, as John has bought and paid for this several times over.

Not really the AH, but your sister is right about the fact that the ex and John can possibly ratchet up their pettiness because of your (well deserved) gloating and make life miserable for everyone including your daughter and husband.

NTA rosie knows that her mom and john are not worth the breath by now", "NTA considering John spent your entire 'relationship' trying to taunt you. he's a shitty person a cheat and intentionally tried to sabotage your relationship with your daughter. She's 25, she doesn't seem to like John, she knows he's a liar and a shitty person and so there isn't much or a relationship to damage. She's not going to be or is already not living at home presumably, it's not your place to protect her relationship with your shitty ex wife or her shitty husband.", "You did well.", "NTA, he brought it up, you responded", "NTA. John has invested a lot of his miserable shitty life into trying to alienate Rosie from you, and it must properly boil his piss to see how that\u2019s worked out for him. Gloat away, he deserves it.", "Info: does your daughter have password protection on all vendors? Those are common nowadays. \n\nI am not pleased with your gloating because it is like pissing your pants: you feel the warm for a moment and then you just stink. \n\nDo I blame you for doing it? Nah, I would have been unable to resist too. Justified assholes are NTA on this sub.", "ESH. Are you all twelve?", "NTA.  OP has been more than gracious.  He\u2019s forgiven this misstep.  One of these days Rosie is going to go off and tell step-dad exactly what she thinks of him and it will be way overdue.", "This reads like an exercise in teenage wish fulfillment.", "NTA.\n\nFor the couple who have been \u201cpetty\u201d towards you for 23 years, they kind of deserve it.\n\nTheir own nastiness opened your daughter\u2019s eyes. Rosie is a grown woman who can manage her relationship with those two vile people going forward. You don\u2019t have to be their punching bag. Your sister\u2019s perspective is off in this instance.\n\nYou\u2019re a decent person which means you\u2019re not going to go out of your way to be rude or vindictive. Rosie has decided. Just enjoy being her *dad*.", "NTA. What the hell is wrong with all these step-parents going all psycho about some other person's kids? \n\nIt never works out!", "Instead of rejoicing in the fact that the child had more people to love her, he made it a competition. NTA", "NTA\n\nScrew that jerk. If for nothing else screw him for trying to say your kid was his.\nRosie has made her choice, her fiance is happy with it, only person upset is a massive prick. He could have just been a cool step dad, but he wanted to be the real dad and failed.\nForget about him, he's lucky you haven't repeatedly punched him in the face.", "This. NTA, John 100% earned it, but let this be OP\u2019s first and last time stooping to John\u2019s level.", "Yeah, is it just me or is John shooting blanks? Verdict: justified a-hole behavior.", "\u201cYou are asshole, but that does not mean you are *asshole*", "I am aware and I bit my tongue for years and put her first even when it was painful to not completely snap on the guy.", "\u201cTry not spoil your daughters relationship with him\u201d fuck off.", "She knows what happened and she laughed about it.", "Yes, she knows that was said. She's not too surprised. She said he only ever cared about trying to claim her as his own.", "Yeah. It would never gotten to the point where I needed to gloat, and the reason would not have been good for step-dad.\n\n\nEta: I think OPs approach is better. I am just not that good of a man.", "Absolutely the long game should be the plan. My ex has tried to make every guy she's dated their new daddy. The current one is my ex best friend who was the best man at my wedding. I ignore them and go on with my relationship with my kids. They're older now and have both told me they only ever had one Dad. .\n\nOP,  just focus on your daughter. That's it's. Fuck that other asshole. I'm sure she understands what's going on. Just let it go and live your life. Have fun walking your daughter down the aisle and don't give that prick a second thought.", "OP is human. I think Rosie would give him this one.", "OP modeled grace and maturity and what a good dad looks like, by not making his daughter chose sides, her step dad on the other hand \u2026 I agree, take the high road, keeps one from looking petty and draws people to you.", "Take a selfie while walking her down the aisle with mom and John in the background. Then get a large print of it made and sent to them as a thank you gift for helping with the wedding. Then get a print made for yourself but have them do that Gaussian blur to the background.", "I agree.  The wedding is about ROSIE, not the feud between OP and stepdad.  Don't do anything further to antagonize John between now and after the honeymoon.    \n\nAlso, i'm not going to fault OP for having a lapse in judgement but OP HAS ALREADY WON.  He shouldn't have gloated because now his ex and John are going to bring this up as an example for anything and everything.   And each time, the story is going to get worse and worse.", "*It's *I", "*I'm", "Maybe he can't have kids? Like men can be infertile too you know.", "*didn't *I'm *I"]}
