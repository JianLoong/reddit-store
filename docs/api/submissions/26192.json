That you are Rosie's dad, that she knows it and loves you and picked you, both for herself and Seb.\n\nAnd the fact that SEB wants you to dance with him, too, while John doesn't give a flip about him only proves that he doesn't care about Rosie.

Now it's your turn, and all you have to do is stay the course!  \nYou waited to be asked by your daughter.   \nNeither John nor your ex wife has any input into her choice.", "NTA at all, not even a little bit.

I doubt it will come back on your daughter too much since she is the one who made the original decision. \n\nThey made their bed of spite and now can wallow to their hearts content. You, your daughter, and Seb will have a wonderful time at the wedding and life.", "No AH but keep your cool as you have been the whole time. I don't see how that would make her life with them \"harder\". She's their only (step) child and it sounds like they've tried to win her over. She already knows he's petty and boastful. \n\nI'd worry more about what Rosie thinks about the story. You don't want Rosie to ask you did you say whatever he said you did.  In fact you probably want to confess to her that he aggressively accosted you in the shops and after years of him taunting you over stealing her and her mum, esp as it's disrespectful of her choices, and you're so proud of her so you finally cracked and said some retorts that you regret when you should have kept your cool, but she's not to worry you'll keep your cool again in the future and say nothing. You want her to be relaxed approaching her wedding.\n\nActually you might want to look into sending him a cease and desist letter from a lawyer after years of his harrassing acts and maybe even get a restraining order to keep a polite distance and not speak to you.

Not to John or your ex, because F them.\n\nBut to yourself and maybe a little bit to Rosie. You let them get to you and get under your skin and you got petty and vindictive like them.

It isn't good in the long run.\n\nDo it for yourself.", "Not the asshole. John is an incredibly insecure man. He wanted to be he dad so bad because he\u2019s infertile. \n\nHe didn\u2019t want a relationship with Rosie to enrich her life and make her happy and secure. He wanted it for his own ego. \n\nHe tried to lie to himself and you about how much she loved him. Tried to get you out of the picture, tried to Chang\u2019e her name. All because he\u2019s insecure. What a loser. \n\nNothing will be harder for Rosie, do you think it\u2019s been easy all these years with them bombarding her to change her name and cut you out of her life. That\u2019s just what you know about. It was probably worse behind closed doors.\n\nIf they want to be grandparents they\u2019ll act right. That however will be the next battleground. \n\nHave a great time at the wedding!", "> My sister suggested, while not wrong overall, that maybe it would make Rosie's life harder with her mom and John.\n\nShe's 25.

Swing away merril", "You've been \"handling\" them for a long time. You did amazing. This was a lapse. NTA", "Petty? In all honesty, no. \"John\" reaped what he sowed, nothing more. As for who deserves more, that's bs. It's ultimately your daughter's decision. It was never a competition.\n\nAnd if you feel your daughter will dislike what you did, talk to her and apologize for letting emotions get the best of you. Although I suspect she won't mind.\n\nAnyway, NTA.", "I\u2019m not a big fan of gloating, but based on what\u2019s presented, I\u2019d say this is a free-pass.

Wallow in that moment until your fingers get all pruny.", "NTA, the major asshole here is John.", "I have a feeling that Rosie has been well on her way to going LC with mom and NC with John. \n\nNTA\n\nJust support your daughter and have her back!", "Gloating is typically a major AH move, it shows how petty a person really is.

You would have to have been superhuman to take anymore.\n\nIf I had to guess, he's still jealous and bitter about the years you had what he wanted.

You had one chance, and you made the most of it in my opinion.\n\nA side note: I teared up, and still have some emotions around when you said they asked you to dance with *both* of them - I think that\u2019s so beautiful, and it also speaks to the role you have played in their lives. \n\nYou don\u2019t sound like an AH at all.

Whether it be walking her down the aisle, groomsman, dancing with him... she didn't. \n\nI think Rosie was wise to John's BS early on with the adoption/name change attempts, attempting to force her into his career field, etc. This is just the icing on the cake for Rosie to show him his place in her life, and dad isn't it.", "I mean it was a dick move but considering the asshole who you were doing it to imma go with NTA. But tell your daughter what you did so it cant be used against you.", "NTA Rosie's life is with her new husband now. And let her decide how to handle her wedding.

I'd feel differently if Rosie were still a minor living with her mom and having to deal with the fall out of his one small moment of gloating. But she's in her 20s, she's gainfully employed, she's getting married, etc. If her mom and John cop an attitude with her about it, I'm sure she's got a shiny enough spine to tell them to shove off. Especially as we know she's already not a fan of John's. Plus she's watched her dad be a great model of restraint and composure over the years (way to go, OP!), so I'm quite sure she'll be fine in dealing with whatever snarky insults they'll have about the situation.
