That you are Rosie's dad, that she knows it and loves you and picked you, both for herself and Seb.\n\nAnd the fact that SEB wants you to dance with him, too, while John doesn't give a flip about him only proves that he doesn't care about Rosie.

I would caution about any future interactions with John solely for the fact that someone as interfering and self-absorbed as John is certainly not above sabotaging or otherwise disrupting Rosie and Seb\u2019s wedding", "NnnnoootkkkkindofTA maybe?  Not really the AH, but your sister is right about the fact that the ex and John can possibly ratchet up their pettiness because of your (well deserved) gloating and make life miserable for everyone including your daughter and husband. These types treat life like a game, and you can bet they\u2019re already scheming. I would apologize to him, try to smooth things over, but don\u2019t expect much to change as far as he\u2019s concerned. Family is more important than winning.", "NTA but your sister is right.", "It's their wedding, It's their choice.", "NTA, John sounds like a Disney villain, only less successfull.", "NTA  \nEven if you were, they had been TA for so long that it seems the meaning of being an AH was lost.  \nSaid that, why do they even care?", "NTA - its Rosie's choice who she has walk her down the aisle and who she dances with at her wedding.  \n\nIt sounds like you were the reasonable adult the whole your ex & her husband were being AH's and trying to remove you from YOUR daughters life and Rosie would've picked up on that when she was young.", "Definitely NTA. I'm not sure how you got through all that without beating that guy within an inch of his life but I have to say, I commend your patience man.\nI'm not sure I could handle that guy running his mouth for very long.", "Did you tell Rosie that John said your fiance can fuck off??", "Gloat all you can when not in the presence of your daughter. They have for years made your life a living hell. You reap what you sow", "Slight NTA\u2026 I only say slight because your sister brings up a good point. I would\u2019ve done exactly what you did though", "NTA", "NTA - John deserved far worse than gloating", "Yes", "NTA. They already think your AH for existing. I would have a talk with Rosie so she\u2019s less caught in the middle. I\u2019m sure she still loves her mom so that\u2019s gotta be hard for her.", "John and ex are one\u2026but you\u2019re NTA. Rosie\u2019s wedding\u2026and she picked you to do the dad stuff.", "Nta. Your turn to gloat. I would say all types of crazy things to him. \u201cGuess who she picked after all anyways\u201d \u201cguess you didn\u2019t end up stealing them both after all, you just got the trash\u201d", "NTA.\n\nShe's 25, she obviously knows that score at this point (and for a while before I'm sure).  He approached you, not the other way, so you simply responded to his unprovoked tantrum.  You're allowed the gloat in this case as it wasn't you initiating it.  All he had to do was not start a conversation with you in the first place.  I'm shocked your daughter is even allowing him at the wedding, honestly I'd tell her about the encounter and watch her uninvite him for his disrespect.", "OP, you already won. Just keep a good relationship with your daughter and her SO, that'll keep Ex and John super salty for a long time.", "NTA. Sounds like John and the ex have been assholes the entire time while Rosie was growing up. I say give them a taste of their own medicine every now and then and see how they handle it. I understand you're being the bigger man by remaining civil for your daughter, but you gotta admit; it probably felt AMAZING to be smug in John's face.", "Nope, NTA. He most definitely deserved it. You got your chance to be petty, but i do agree with one commenter, *GreekAmericanDom* about how to move forward with grace in the situation and showing John that you have a better relationship with your daughter because of it. Hopefully he continues to act the way he does around her and continues to push her further away, rather than closer to him. He\u2019s even more of an idiot if he doesn\u2019t realize that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing.", "Nta, i would've called him infertile johnny. Now I don't have anything against infertility, but john was a d!ck(tried to adopt your kid while your still alive, idk if that's allowed but c'mon!)  and he clearly wants a kid.", "NTA- Congratulations on walking your daughter and her fiancee down the aisle.  You are truly a blessed father.", "NTA your daughter and her fiance asked you.  Period. The end", "NTA. Rosie\u2019s wedding, Rosie\u2019s choice. Her opinion should be the only one that matters", "Both your ex and John are major AHs. \n\n>and told me her fiance can go fuck himself but he's Rosie's dad\n\nSTEPdad at most, and has clearly been rejected as the father figure. Idk why he unloads his frustration at you in the first place. He cheated, thought he was walking away like a winner to take it all from you and keep his children. Meanwhile he lost them, his \"new kid\" doesn't want him as a father after he's been an AH to her actual father, and he still manages to blame YOU for it lmao \n\n>He'd taunt me with things like \"she'll like me more one day\", \"you're just ONE of her dad's now\", \"you'll lose them both to me someday\"\n\n*chef's kiss* \nHe started the competition and lost it :)\n\nYou seem like a sound bloke and a good father, OP. \nVery clearly NTA", "Gloating was being a bit of an AH, but after all that other shit, you get to be the AH, and that\u2019s ok", "I didn't read your whole justification, because gloating is inherently a dick move.", "NTA. If only Rosie would sit him at the kids table with a plate of chicken nuggies for the fussy toddler John is...", "I agree with your sister.\nYou are not THE Asshole.  Ex and John are but you were inconsiderate to your daughter and the fallout that she may suffer.", "BUT FOR John approaching you and opening his mouth, you would have said nothing. NTA", "> My ex and John both said I was an asshole.\n\nThe two people who tried six times to change your daughter's last name? Who tried to adopt her without your consent? Who taunted you all those years about how you're not her only dad, and how they hoped you'd give up on her? \n\nThose people said you were an asshole?\n\nThat can mean only one thing: you're doing something right.\n\nNTA", "NTA, people say petty is wrong, but i think in some cases, it's thoroughly justified.\n\nEnjoy the wedding!", "NTA I find it best to gloat AFTER the deal is done.  I also don't gloat in front of other people, only to myself.  \n\nLet your daughter know by your actions that you are a class act.  The other guy has no power over you.", "NTA. I would've gloated AND decked him", "NTA.\n\nThey better be lucky they're getting an invite since they have been a thorn in Rose's side as well.", "NTA", "Nta.\nI bet it felt good, too, after the years of bs", "NTA. Jesus fucking Christ what is it with people and their utterly lunatic expectations these days? He deserved every inch of that and then some. Fuck that guy, and fuck your ex. Best of luck OP, and I hope your daughter's day is blessed :)", "He\u2019s been trying to dig your grave to bury you in it.  Instead, he fell in, you buried him in it, then pissed on it afterwards.  NTA", "With regret, I have to say YTA. Your sister is right, you've made things a little harder for Rosie.\n\nYou've been amazingly patient and civil through all of this nonsense.  I know it's been hard.  But you need to continue.", "NTA \n      John deserved what you gave him.  He is the Ahole for trying to come between you and your daughter that\u2019s just evil.", "NTA - At first, reading the title question, my instinct was that you were probably and I had to read the whole thing to get there, but he sounds like he tried to poison things between you and she saw through it. Enjoy the wedding.", "NTA. Fuck John and your floozy EX", "NTA although not your finest moment.\n\nTell Rosie about the encounter before John spins it in front of her. Cuz he absolutely will. She probably won't believe him, but better to tell her first.", "NTA. John was playing with fire and got surprised when he got burned.", "NTA and I would of done the same. I honestly think your daughter should not have him at the wedding as he's going to cause issues. Your daughter sounds like she knows who the better man is and has her head screwed on x", "Of course you were, but since that's how John and your ex wanted to play it we have to judge with that in mind.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I'm angry for your sake, but also for Rosie's sake. Your ex's affair-partner (that's what he'll always be) blew up Rosie's family, then spent the next sixteen years stomping on Rosie's boundaries.", "Rosie is an adult. She's choosing her party for her special day.\nNTA. Walk with pride and enjoy the dance!", "Not the ahole. Her choice end of.", "NTA. You \\[mostly\\] took the high road, whereas J mostly was a DH.", "NTA. Gloating is probably not the best idea, but John is the one who tried to manipulate your daughter, and now he\u2019s getting his just reward.\n\nIn my opinion, you probably shouldn\u2019t have gloated, because it doesn\u2019t really solve anything, but you were most definitely justified.", "I don\u2019t blame for for gloating after bottling it all up throughout the years. Happy to hear you maintained a great relationship with your daughter. The reason the Ex and John think YTA is because they are so oblivious to all the crap he pulled over the years", "NTA. \n\nBut I recommend to humbly gloat.", "If your daughter has chosen you to be there for her wedding as the father, then screw what everybody else thinks", "NTA\n\nHe earned the gloat.\n\nAlso it doesn't sound like Rosie has much to do with him anymore. Thanks to his own actions.\n\nYou were civil with these people for all of Rosie's childhood. She's an adult now with her own career and about to have her own family. She's now old enough to understand that you don't like these people.", "Not the AH.  A momentary slip.  You've done an absolutely incredible job at keeping cool, based on this story.  You are better to continue the path of calm and quiet, let fate takes its course.  \nJohn is 1000% the AH here.  Screw that guy.  Let him wallow, he'll figure it out one day, or won't.  You keep on keeping on, knowing you're a great dad.", "You gave him back what he was dishing out and he couldn't handle it. DO NOT feel bad about this.", "Definitely NTA\nI really hate when mothers try to push out the bio dad for the husband in order to have the perfect family together. It\u2019s wrong and 9 times outta 10 this is what happens. The child ends up resenting the custodial parent for trying to drive a wedge between themselves and the other parent. John deserves what happened to him and I hope you have a wonderful time at your daughters wedding.", "NTA, gloating isn't a nice thing to do in general, but there are some occasions it is well deserved.", "You gloated, YTA.  John is a huge asshole, but you were the asshole in this specific instance (and should probably apologize to your daughter in case this has come back around to her via your ex and John).  The good news is that John is so much of an asshole that taking the higher road and making amends to him is pointless, the way you tell it.", "Your calm and civil demeanor is probably why Rosie chose you. I hope your ex and John don\u2019t use this one-time incident against you to make it out like you are no better than they are.", "nta, but learn to just block the ex and john out. they aren't important at all, and \"winning\" against them would just drag you down. celebrate your daughter and your relationship, that's all that matters bow", "ESH. This is your daughter's wedding. It's not about you, man. You just took the bait and kicked off a conflict she's going to have to deal with and hear about. Search up the term \"grey rock.\"", "NTA \n\nWere you an AH for one moment? Sure. But your ex\u2019s husband deserved it, and after two decades of crap from him, I\u2019ll bet that interaction was delicious! Thank you for being a good Dad.", "While they may sometimes call for the same actions, there is a difference between taking the high road and playing the long game.\n\nIf I understand you correctly, then we both recommend OP continue playing the long game.  It has paid dividends so far, so no reason to change strategy now.", "All OP has to do is go to Rosie's wedding and fill the role she asked him to and nothing more. John will be... delighted to say the least.", "exactly my thoughts, the best revenge? a well lived and loved life with your daughter, sharing all her future adventures, that the best revenge, having something beautiful  that he will never have", "> In general, gloating is an AH move, but John brought all of this on himself. He has been working to turn Rosie against you from the get go.\n\nOut loud. *Gloating.*\n\nNTA. Guy's a fucking prick.", ">Going forward handle this issue with grace. I am not advocating for the high road. I'm actually advocating for even deeper revenge. The more grace you show, the better life you live, the greater relationship you have with Rosie and your future grand children, the more it will piss him off.\n\nI like that. Treat John like what he is; a speck of fecal matter on the ground that'll be forgotten as soon as he's out of sight.", "Perfect response", "[removed]", "I agree with NTA but OP should be happy that stepdad loved his daughter. He didn\u2019t abuse or treat her with indifference. Stepdad is a jerk but he didn\u2019t damage OP\u2019s child.", "Its not to please his wife, its to please himself. He wanted to steal another guy's whole family so his ego felt stroked", "I have to disagree with some of your reasoning while I do understand where you're coming from. Constantly ignoring someone is a lot harder than it seems, and everyone is different and has different skills. We all have our breaking points, and he clearly reached his.", "I don\u2019t know.\n\nI do think this probably made Rosie\u2019s life harder with her mom. Rosie probably appreciated her Dad being the bigger man and better person *for her* for her entire childhood.\n\nPlus, Op didn\u2019t have to say anything to gloat. The smile on his face while walking his daughter down the aisle on her wedding day and crying tears of joy at their father-daughter dance while John seethes on the sidelines should have been enough.", "The stepdad has basically spent his entire time being a step trying to alienate the kid from her dad and doing more gloating per interaction than OP will probably manage in a lifetime. I say GOATS get to gloat!", "Hire security or have several groomsmen ready to linebacker the idiot if he tries something.", "Nah, it's best to not even look at his direction. Don't give John the satisfaction of knowing that he got to OP. When he passes by John, he should just look lovingly at his daughter. Give her his focus and let John seethe from the sidelines", "Absolutely not. This is Rosie's wedding and doing that might cause a ruckus and she doesn't deserve that. What a childish suggestion.", "John already has a history of lying by calling OP a deadbeat dad when he was hospitalized.\n\nOP should definitely high road from here, but John doesn't have a lot of actual ammo from this. Just hearsay from a biased source that OP acted uncharacteristically.", "I'd probably have looked for any way to legally ruin John's life.", "Exactly. Rosie is definitely wise to the way John and her mother have been acting to her dad.", "Then OP looks better for being reasonable, and he\u2019ll get to enjoy his daughter\u2019s wedding without Frick and Frack in the way. Fingers crossed that\u2019s the end result.", "Honestly, I hope Rosie comes across this post and goes NC with John.", "Yeah, I get it. But it muddies the water. It's clear his daughter has seen her father act with restraint and integrity while step-dad has been going off the rails. She recognizes the one that puts her first. \n\nThis time, he put himself first, to feel good. I think if the daughter witnessed the exchange she would be, at a minimum, disappointed. \n\nAs I said, he had a right and reason to say what he did, it's just that he;s not doing himself any favors. It's fine, the vote will be N.TA and it's right that it should be, but I figured I'd just throw this out there and give himself something to think about.", "OP:  I didn't even notice John there.  Heck, I didn't notice anyone else there. All I saw was how radiantly beautiful my daughter looked and how happy she and Seb are. <dramatically dabs a tear of pride and happiness away>", "Doesn't matter if it's legit ammo or not. John can warp this into a \"justification\". You would be surprised as what people like John can do with the smallest, tiniest piece of info. And John could see this as validation and become empowered and just ramp everything up. Do I think Rosie or anybody would believe him? No, but I have personally witnessed people wear them down to the point where they cave just to make it stop. Do I think this is absolutely what would happen? Not necessarily but I think that since there is a chance it's something OP should consider.", "Im smiling so much. I need to watch Chicago  again asap.", "How could he make their lives harder, she's an adult", "Perfection", "Okay... what will he justify? Rosie is 25 and lives independently.", "Hers is the only opinion that matters on the topic. If she thinks you did the right thing, then you did. NTA,", "No clue, like I said John is crazy and they can warp and twist words in order to get there way.\n\nAgain, I'm not saying op should run and apologize or live in fear or even that John is some mastermind. I've just seen and been in situations incredibly similar to this and watched it go south in ways you wouldn't think were possible. I'm just saying OP should be careful. Especially because this particular situation revolves around a wedding so this topic will likely come up again and again. How many posts have been here from people talking about how family issues turned the wedding experience into a fresh new kind of hell? Even if Rosie finally & justifiably kicks John to the curb I doubt anybody wants that at the expense of Rosie remembering her wedding as nothing but family drama.\n\nI think you might be reading too much into that part. I only put it there as a \"hey I seen something like this before and it went bad like this so you might want to watch out\"\n\nThe main point is that because his gloating could cause problems for Rosie it probably wasn't the best idea even if it was justified and John deserved it.", "I don't know. I feel like his ex disappearing versus him choosing not to be in their lives would speak to his character. They weren't genetically his, but how do you raise kids for years and then just decide you don't care?", "Why didnt he have children himself with his current wife? Sounds like he wanted Rosie to like him just to boost his ego (like, \"im so cool i got a kid to hate her bio dad\")"]}
