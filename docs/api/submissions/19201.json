I also asked during the other pregnancies. \n\nEach time the offer was declined due to the fact she didn\u2019t want a baby shower. She didn\u2019t like them, and just wasn\u2019t fussed about having one thrown for her.\n\nCut to beginning of this year. She texts me to say her sister and young niece are throwing her a baby shower. We didn\u2019t have a discussion about it, one text, to which I replied ok I\u2019ll give them a text to see if they need help with anything. \nDuring the period between that text and said baby shower, it wasn\u2019t brought up again. I didn\u2019t think about it much afterwards as I had a number of other things on my mind. I had two VERY poorly immediate relatives, a friend having surgery, a number of exams I was taking to do with my work, amongst other normal everyday life things. \n\nA week before the proposed shower date I text my friend and asked if the shower was still happening. She said yes but I could tell she was being off with me. We then didn\u2019t speak for a week which is strange for us. I eventually text and asked if she was mad at me and she said yes, then proceeded to explain why. In a nutshell she was annoyed that I hadn\u2019t text her sister to help with the baby shower, and she expected me to want to be more involved in it. She thinks that because I didn\u2019t text until close to the shower to find out if it was still happening it was just an after thought and inconvenience for me. She also mentioned she knows I have a lot on but so does everyone. She\u2019s upset by my \u201clack of effort\u201d. The message was ended with \u201cI\u2019m not being precious because I didn\u2019t want the baby shower in the first place\u201d \nI then sent an apology. I said (summarised) that I\u2019m wrong for not having text her sister, and I should\u2019ve reached out as I said I would, and in future I\u2019ll be better at communicating. This was ignored. I reached out a few days later to advise it would be best if I didn\u2019t come to the shower, along with another apology, and that I hope she has a great time. This also has been ignored, and since my last apology no other texts have been exchanged. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing - up until this we have had NO issues in our friendship. None. Not even a bicker. We\u2019re always on the same page for everything. If we\u2019re not it doesn\u2019t matter we don\u2019t fall out about it. I go to all her parties, I babysit for her often, I\u2019ve house sat for her a few times, I\u2019m close with her family, I show up whenever she needs me. \n\nSo AITA for not showing up to the baby shower, for not being involved in the shower, and for not asking if I was invited as she\u2019s mad at that too.", "created_utc": 1686132981, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14398vv/aita_for_not_helping_with_the_baby_shower/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As someone with ADHD, if you said you\u2019d text and ended up not, I\u2019d assume you forgot over anything malicious. If she was this bothered about it, she could have reminded you or asked her sister to reach out to you.", "I am confused, did you promise to text the sister about helping with the shower? Because the way you worded it makes it sound like you did.", "ESH - To keep it simple, you said you\u2019d text to help out and you didn\u2019t. Your friend is behaving like a child ignoring you. \n\nI hope you two can work it out.", "ESH\n\nHer for ignoring you instead of trying to communicate\n\nYou for promising to text her sister and not doing it", "ESH \n\nYou said you would contact, you didnt.\n\nHer response seems a bit much, perhaps something more to the shower than you know. Maybe her sister and young niece aren't organising very well and she wanted you to jump in and steer the ship to safety?", "ESH Don't offer to do something if you're not going to follow through. But she really should have communicated her hurt with you, and it sounds like she's taking her feelings about the shower out on you.", "> Cut to beginning of this year    \n\nSo like 6 months ago you told your BEST FRIEND  you would text her sister & niece to offer to help with the baby shower.  And you talk weekly as i'm reading the \"We then didn\u2019t speak for a week which is strange for us\" remark.   \n\nAnd the baby shower never came back up?  You never remembered that you were supposed to offer to help?   \n\nI guess it's a good thing she never took you up on your offer to host a shower previously because here's where it ended up.   \n\nHonestly, i'm not even sure how to judge this because there's aspects of so many of the judgements.  I'll come back later perhaps to edit with a judgement.", "Sorry, but YTA, you promised you would text and offer help and you didn't. You never once mention you forgot, just that you had other things on your plate. It would have helped to at least let her know all of that. Or even when you texted her if the shower is still taking place, you could have apologized then or offer last minute help, but you chose not to continue the conversation and if she didn't say anything more, why would you. It's almost like you were hoping she forgot and for her not to remind you about the offer you made sincer there was still time for you to pitch in. You kept making it worsewith every move. You waited days on unanswered texts when you already knew she was mad at you instead of picking up the phone and call her or meeting her in person to set things straight. A good friendship is not measured in lack of fights (for example a shallow relationship will never have fights since no one cares enough), it's normal to have fights and different opinions, but you have to talk it out as soon as possible. Ignoring problems never solved them.", "Thank you for the comment :) have a good day!", "This made me laugh - sprinkle. \nThank you for commenting :)", "I know I genuinely debated it but after she didn\u2019t reply to my apology in my mind she didn\u2019t want me there - maybe I was overthinking it or maybe not but I felt it would be awkward. \n\nThank you :)", "I Hope so! Thank you :)", "No one text me until the day before to invite me, but she feels that I was expected to reach out prior to this to ask if I was invited or what was happening.", "I\u2019m kinda feeling the same at the moment sadly. I\u2019ve never listed comparisons of what I\u2019ve put effort in Vs what she has as there has never been need to - we are supposed to be friends. However since this whole incident and discussing it with family members it has made me realise maybe I\u2019m too much of a giver which is why this is seeming such a huge thing to her. Idk.", "I\u2019ve also NEVER let her down on anything before so the fact she can jump on me this hard for the first thing I\u2019ve ever forgotten about seems brutal to me\n\nThank you!", "I said \u201cI\u2019ll give her a text and see if she wants me to do something\u201d. I then didn\u2019t reach out which is totally my bad and on me, and something I\u2019ve apologised twice for.", "Thank you!", "Agreed I definitely should\u2019ve text straight away whilst it was in my mind.\n\nThank you for commenting!", "I\u2019ve thought about this - I wonder if I\u2019m being the punching bag for a general feeling she\u2019s having.", "Thank you - I really regret not texting her sister straight away it would\u2019ve saved a lot of agro!", "She clearly stated the friend has numerous children. Don't throw out your baby gear until you're done having babies. Plain and simple.", "Thanks for the view point I really appreciate it!\n\nSo genuinely I did forget - I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of everything going on or the fact that neither of us mentioned it again - I just didn\u2019t give it more thought. I should\u2019ve text her sister as soon as I said I would and it\u2019s totally on me that I didn\u2019t. It goes without saying had I of known how important this baby shower actually was to her I would\u2019ve made an effort. \n\nHave a great day and thanks again for taking the time to give me another viewpoint on this situation! :)", "[removed]", "I always learned to always give people the benefit of the doubt until they show their true selves. And since you never let her down, it\u2019s crazy to make that jump. \n\nHere\u2019s a counter example from my life. I have a therapist who I love. I had to cancel (with advanced notice), so I emailed her. I didn\u2019t receive a response in 24 hours. So I emailed again to confirm that she got the email. She did and forgot to hit send. I didn\u2019t assume she\u2019s horrible because she forgot. And I took the responsibility to follow up.", "Does this sound plausible: \n\nYour friend never wanted a baby shower.  \nHer sister insisted on hosting one with her daughter  \nWhile organising the sister has decided a bunch of things that obviously friend would like.  \nFriend thinks it would be easier to ask you to get involved and be objective and sort out the event  \nThe fact you didn't just made your friend realise she will have to sit through her sisters plan  \n\n\nProbably not the case but its interesting to speculate.", "I honestly think that depends on mutiple factors. For example some families dont have the space to keep a crib for mutiple years in case they have another child. Or a stroller. Or a baby car seat. There are defintely things you can keep but not everything. Im not saying either of them is right, but it sometimes isnt that easy either", "I've never heard of anything you're going on about right now and I certainly don't live under a rock.", "Why be rude to OP? Sprinkle is a still conisdered a relatively new term, not everywhere uses that term, and many still just refer to it as a shower and request no/few gifts. \n\nDoesn't mean they live under a rock because they aren't familiar with a word that's really only been popularized for a small number of years.", "Why did her reply make you decide to be so unkind?\n\nYour response was not called for at all.", "Potentially! I was thinking maybe her sister wasn\u2019t putting as much effort in as she would\u2019ve liked and therefore I got the blame for putting in zero effort too?! I am an arsehole for not texting her sister when I said I would 1000% but I just feel like I\u2019m getting hit extremely hard for something she never wanted.", "[removed]", "I genuinely didn\u2019t realise it was an actual term I thought it was just a joke because it seems strange that the baby shower term would need modifying or changing to me ha", "Id leave them be. They\u2019re over in another sub being just as rude. They already commented back to me with language that got the comment automatically removed. \n\nSome people are just angry and there\u2019s no dealing with them.", "This is why ESH :D", "I hope whatever's making you so nasty resolves for you soon.", "Same, they seem like a generally rude person hahah"]}
