This woman is beyond pathetic, shameless, mannerless and she needs a hard reality check! Who in their right mind expect co-workers to be their personal taxi? She\u2019s taking advantage of you because of your age and because you have showed how easy it is to make you do something that you don\u2019t really want to.

YOU OWE HER NOTHING!", "Now that way of thinking really ticks me off. \"You don't have a husband or kids to rush home to so you have the time, you do it.\" That is bull crap. So because I don't have people at home waiting for me, my time isn't valuable? I don't have important things to get home to? I've had this done to me when I was single, volunteered, by coworkers to work over, when I didn't want to, because I was single, so my time must be invaluable. Sorry Karen, I may not have a family at home but I have a life and plans too. One of you can work I'm not doing it just because I'm single. NTA.

If she doesn\u2019t want to walk, she can get an Uber. She doesn\u2019t ask nor offer gas money. Stop taking this girl home. Tell her no and stop letting her in your car.

This is sexist as hell and expecting a woman to a) read someone else\u2019s mind, b) always be available for what someone else might want, and c) they are denying someone (OP) autonomy.

This D person is an entitled asshat who is treating you like her personal chauffeur. The others are only hearing her side and probably picking on you because you are younger. D is a grown ass woman who is perfectly capable of organising her own ride home and communicating with others to car share when applicable. Don\u2019t let these people bully you! What did she do before you were there? They are probably just mad because they thought that they had permanently pushed a burden onto you. She can revert to that. Tell her (and them) that you are ok giving lifts when it doesn\u2019t put you out of your way or cause you any stress or loss to your time or money.

I commented above guessing this and now there's confirmation. I went through a similar issue about working on holidays bc I didn't have kids and wasn't married, so I covered the holidays a few times for my other coworkers who did have kids and travel plans and stuff. But then they just assumed I would do that every year, without even asking or thanking me. It sucked.\n\nDepending on your workplace dynamics and if you plan to continue working there, you might have to do a \"kill 'em with kindness\" style attack.

I never want you to be in that position again, and my schedule is just so topsy-turvy now with all the changes in my life and the family issues, so I won't drive you home any more and you can make other plans without waiting for me. That was so sweet that you waited for me and I truly feel awful that you assumed I was your ride when we hadn't made plans.\" etc etc. Just gush at her until she thinks you've apologized, and just keep repeating that your schedule isn't predictable and you simply can't drive her any more.", "It\u2019s not that they contacted op, they disparaged op as a bad feminist for not giving lifts to a person who hadn\u2019t even asked for one", "\n>I wouldn't jump to HR. I would jump to a sit down with OP's boss\n\nActually, that's exactly what HR is for. There may be legal or liability issues involved. The boss doesn't work in HR and therefore may not have the training or qualifications to handle this sort of issue. Or the boss may avoid the issue or even pressure OP to not change anything or not go to HR."]}
