She also won't give you her address?  What kind of fukery is that?  She has assumed you are her ride when you didn't offer or volunteer.", "NTA. Time to inform D that her transportation is NOT your responsibility. Owning a car doesn't obligate you to provide rides to her and it's time to just start saying \"no. I'm busy and not going to be driving you anymore. Stop demanding it and just expecting it.\"\n\nYou don't owe her a ride, and her not even brothering to ask and just expecting a ride is rude AF. Next time she says you're my ride, tell her no I'm not. Or just demand 10 bucks in gas money per trip.", "Nta the entitlement these days is deplorable. Tell her to get an Uber it's not your problem she doesn't have a ride", "NTA. Why does feminist equal unpaid, unappreciated taxi?", "NTA. She\u2019s not your responsibility. They could have given her a ride. Or she can Uber", "NTA. You do not owe anyone any lifts anywhere. Especially if they don\u2019t ask", "NTA, I have a new coworker who for whatever reason decided I would be her ride home.  I told her I'm neither a taxi nor am I nice.  Unlike my coworkers I've got a 45 minute drive, unless the highway is stopped, and kids to get home to.  I ain't driving no one.  It's not our job and it's not our problem.", "YTA Not for leaving D there, but for letting this situation go on.\n\nUnpopular, I know, but... This problem exists and is lingering because you will not address your concerns with your co-worker.", "OP, just text this woman, \"I'm no longer available to give you a ride home after work so please plan accordingly. Even if you walk me out to my car, I will not be able to give you a ride home.\" Have it spelled out, so there's no confusion. It's not your responsibility to take her home, but just tell her.", "And D should have offered gas money (the bare minimum). Some people have no decency and self-respect.", "\n\nOne night my phone rang with this woman demanding that I give her a ride.", "I 100% agree!!  OP You Are NTA!!  But You Need to speak up, with the truth!!  \n\n1) She NEEDS to ASK in ADVANCE because it is beyond rude to just assume that you are ok with it!!\n\n2) Just because she asks DOES NOT mean you have to say yes.  If for any reason you cannot, or just don't want to, then tell her you are sorry but you are not available to do it. Nothing else needs to be said.\n\n3) Tell her that if she doesn't want to give you an exact address to use as a destination for you to drive to that you WILL NOT continue to trigger your anxiety issues by driving her anymore!!  \n\nIt's scary but you NEED TO USE YOUR WORDS!!", "Lies, even polite lies, often make a woman weaker in these situations.  They open her up to being \"argued around\" or \"negotiated\" into doing the exact thing she was trying to avoid doing in the first place.  OP is dealing with someone who just tells her that she is going to drive her home, or just follows her to the care.  Kinda obvious that OP is dealing with someone who has different social skills that might prevent polite lies from working.", "I would bring it up to your boss. You can also tell your co-worker something like, \"It's no longer possible for me to provide rides, you'll have to find an alternative way to get home from now on.\""]}
