It's a private school, and part of their traditions is a beginning of the year overnight class trip every August. She was too late for this year, but next years' is a 2 night trip to Philadelphia. \n\nOne problem: no more than 6 people can share a hotel room, and there are now 37 girls that would need one. We found out that there's a group of 4 'day-only' kids (3 girls, 1 boy) that actually do stay overnight, at the same hotel even, they just don't do it through the school.\n\nThe four aren't super well liked and there have been bullying issues, especially against the boy, but they're friends with each other, so the parents banded together and decided to just fund and chaperone them themselves to avoid any issues. They do two rooms: one for the kids, and one for whichever parent goes. \n\nThey've reached out and offered to let my daughter share with them. She wants to do it. I'm not comfortable. Coed sleepovers are not acceptable. It's completely inappropriate. \n\nWe've been back and forth with this for weeks. The verdict is clear. There's no open room she can get into through the school, they're not getting her a single room, we can't afford to do anything similar to the other independent group, and we just can't accept a coed sleepover. Going is not an option. \n\nShe's devastated and begging me to reconsider. She says it's my fault that she even had to transfer schools sophmore year and that we've had to move so much that this is the first time we're going to be somewhere for multiple years. I think we need to pass, but now my husband is starting to waffle and say that maybe we should consider making an exception because everything has been hard on her and this is a major school tradition (and opportunity for her to make friends).", "created_utc": 1704171782, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18wh6dq/aita_for_not_letting_my_daughter_go_on_a_class/", "score": 3810, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

These trips are important . This is where memories and friends are made. You need to do everything you can to make this happen.\n\n2. Unless you didn\u2019t register on time or there\u2019s other info you are leaving out, the school needs to find a way to include her. You need to meet with administration and find out why your child is being excluded.\n\nEdit: OP has finally admitted that they missed the deadline to sign up. This is completely OP\u2019s fault, and OP is now punishing the daughter by not letting her go. OP- YTA", "INFO: You said no more than six can share a room so why aren't they doing a room of 4 and a room of 3 through the school? Or have you considered just getting her a room of her own?", "How come your daughter was voted off the Island of girls rooms and now one of the other 37? I would talk to the school admin. It's unacceptable that they are excluding a child. \n\nIf you don't let your daughter go, she will be devastated.", "INFO: Why is your daughter being excluded from the trip?   Did you fail to register her in time?\n\nI would not consider a co-ed room to be a deal breaker, as long as your daughter is comfortable with the kids she'd be sharing with.  In a group like that on a field trip with multiple kids of both genders, it would be unusual for anything sexual to happen.  \n\nMy daughter's friend group in high school happened to be her and 6 boys, because they had common interests.  The group had spontaneous sleepovers at various houses, she participated, and it was always fine.  However, these were boys that she knew and trusted enough to know that nothing serious would happen.", "YTA. This will lead to her getting ostracized more. Figure it out with the school, but keeping her home is wrong when she\u2019s been through so much.", "My parents would not let me go on any of my high school trips because boys were going and they were convinced there would be shenanigans.  Spoiler alert:\nNothing bad happened but I did miss out on the fun and was the only girl in my class that didn\u2019t go.  25 yrs later I\u2019m still mad they didn\u2019t trust me enough to go.

And i'm definitely making assumptions here so im already in the wrong for that, but being \"that boy\" in school... I wouldn't worry too much about that 1 boy...  \n\n\nIt sounds like you're looking for a reason to just not let your daughter go on that trip, so you should just tell her you just don't want her to go. Not sure why you don't but you are sadly the parent. Also the fact you're not even willing to listen to your husbands opinion because its against yours is a giant red flag.  \n\n\nYTA - might as well lock your daughter in the basement until shes of age for you to find her a suitable suitor to marry so she can bear you grandchildren.", "I N F O: why can\u2019t your daughter get in on the school\u2019s rooms?

Any minimally competent school administration/faculty could figure this out without excluding your daughter.", "YTA for thinking a chaperoned co-ed sleepover is this big a problem. You also may be the AH for sending your daughter to such a terrible school. Leaving one student out of a class trip is completely unacceptable. The school needs to figure out a solution.", "YTA. What exactly do you think will happen with it being a co-ed sleepover? That this young boy is some sort of lothario who is going to seduce all the girls into a sexual pileup where they all please him? Of course not! Everyone will change in the bathroom in shifts or they\u2019ll banish him to the bathroom while the girls all change and let him out when they are done.\n\nThe chaperone will likely be in the next room and will be the parent of one of these kids meaning that kid is going to be extra careful to make sure their friends don\u2019t get them in trouble.\n\nAt worst they\u2019ll goof off too late chatting and be tired the next day. It gives your daughter the chance of an instant friend group if she chooses which can be needed for people who change schools a lot.\n\nDon\u2019t take this away from her and leave her out of whatever stories come from the trip. She\u2019ll feel like the odd one out all year whenever something about the trip comes up.\n\nDo you want your daughter to be left out and to feel alone? Always do everything you can to prevent that, right? If your daughter is a smart girl who you have no reason to distrust in this situation, please don\u2019t judge the situation based on it being co-ed, judge it based on how well you feel you raised her.", "YTA, what do you actually think is going to happen in a room with 4 girls and a boy?

If you\u2019re so concerned, book her her own room or go on the trip yourself to supervise, but not allowing her to go is a punishment that is ostracizing her and making her situation more difficult.", "Info: how old is your daughter? Regardless of age what do you think they're gonna do on a school strip, have an orgy?", "Yes YTA. The only one who is thinking of sexual things is YOU. Your daughter just wants to make friends and is being GIVEN an opportunity. Don\u2019t take this away from her just because you have old fashioned ideas about \u201cboys should be with boys and girls should be with girls\u201d", "When I was 13, I got invited to a birthday party for a girl that I desperately wanted to be friends with and be part of her friend group. The party involved a pre-party at the girl's house, then her mom had rented a van to take us all to her aunt's house for a pool party. My mom dropped me off at the pre-party and talked to the other mom, who happened to mention that the aunt's house was in Oak Cliff, the \"bad part of town.\" My mom left, we all piled into the van and hit the road. \n\nAbout 10 mins into the drive, the girl's mom who is driving the van gets a call on her cell phone. It's my mom, who started freaking out on the drive home and decided she didn't want me to go to the pool party because of its location. We had to pull over on the side of the road and wait for my mom to come pick me up. I was so humiliated and angry. My mom had never even been to that part of town, she had no idea what the area was like. It destroyed my chances of being friends with that group, and I have never really forgiven my mom. I eventually bought a house in Oak Cliff and am living here right now.\n\nYTA, and if you don't let your daughter do this she will probably also low-key hate you for it for 25 years.", "YTA. Chaperoned coed sleepovers as part of a class trip are not a big deal. Honestly, a club trip I went on we ended up with one of the boys sleeping on the floor in our room because the boys room smelled bad. We demanded some of the boys cheese allocation as rent. Cheese-based blackmail was the most scandalous thing that happened on that trip. The most salacious was several of us girls soaking our feet in the same tub because they hurt and we had more performances to do. \n\nIf you were saying no to the trip because you couldn\u2019t afford it at all of your daughter was somehow involved in the bullying, that would be potentially reasonable. But just because of sleeping arrangements? That\u2019s ridiculous. And, frankly, probably oversexualizing the children.", "YTA - you are basically saying you don\u2019t trust your daughter, don\u2019t trust the other parents and can\u2019t make any sacrifices for your child.  I\u2019m struggling with the idea that she is in a private school and you can\u2019t find a way to pay for two nights\u2019 hotel in Philly.  If you really can\u2019t afford it - why aren\u2019t you jumping at the chance for the shared room?  I\u2019m also struggling with the idea that somehow your daughter is the only girl to be left out.  None of it makes sense really.", "It's a school trip, and there would be 4 girls to the 1 boy in the coed room, why is this a concern? Do you not trust your daughter? If so, why not? \n\nLeaning toward YTA because you've not given reasons to why this isn't acceptable and why you can't go as a chaperone.", "YTA, but the school is the biggest flaming asshole here. They can't afford enough rooms? I am absolutely baffled here. \n\n(Also where are they finding magic hotel rooms that sleep 6 kids?)", "YTA.  These class trips are major bonding experiences.  And honestly it\u2019s on you to push the school to get an extra room and make rooms of 5 or get a rollaway bed for a room of 7.  You are essentially ostracizing your kid because you don\u2019t want to deal with it.", "YTA. 100%. This trip will make a huge impact on how your daughter makes friends and fits into a new school which it seems like she has had to do multiple times already. Try to remember how hard it was to fit in as a teen and multiply that by how many times she\u2019s had to move schools. By having this ridiculous coed rule, you are keeping her from having a valid bonding experience at her new school. She\u2019ll remember this in therapy as an adult. YTA", "YTA and incredibly ignorant if you think the one thing standing between your daughter and sex is this co-ed sleepover.", "INFO Why is the school excluding your daughter when all the other kids can go?", "Missing this trip will make your daughter miserable. \nHave a good talk with her about your concerns - and how she will handle anything that might come up - although I honestly think they will be fine in a co- ed set up and just stay up all night chatting.\nLetting your kids spread their wings gradually will prepare them for college / living on their own . You can\u2019t keep them in a bubble until they turn 18.\nYTA if you don\u2019t let her go because you don\u2019t trust her - but please know that as a Mom - i know it can be scary to send your kid off into a new situation.", "YTA - for several reasons:\n\n1. For wanting to ostracize your child in a new school for a stupid reason. You said your daughter is a sophomore so she\u2019s like 14-16. At that age, I was not thinking about having sex AT ALL. Granted every kid is different, but you know your child best and the values you instilled in her. Is she even the type of child that would do something like this? If the answer is no then why are you worried?\n\n2. For enrolling your child in a school where the administration doesn\u2019t seem to care about the children\u2019s wellbeing\u2019s. I haven\u2019t seen anyone mention this but it\u2019s concerning to me that there\u2019s been issues with bullying that are so severe that some parents have taken it upon themselves to supervise their children. Why aren\u2019t the chaperones chaperoning well enough that children can feel safe? And why are they not making any efforts to include your daughter in a trip that\u2019s happening more than 6 months away? Idk it\u2019s all very weird\n\nEdit: some of yall seem to be missing my point under my first reason. I\u2019m not saying that teens never think about sex. I\u2019m using myself as an example to show that teenagers aren\u2019t all horny monsters and that if OP knows her child well, she should know which category she falls under and act accordingly", "Very gently, YTA.  \nSchool trips are foundational in your social well-being and social status at school. I remember in middle school, there was a week long trip to Washington DC for all 8th graders. I couldn't go, because my parents couldn't afford to send me (parents paid for hotel rooms, school crowdfunded for the plane tickets). It was absolutely awful to be one of the five kids twiddling their thumbs in nearly empty classrooms, and then have to endure all of the chatter about how fantastic the trip was in the weeks following.  \nYour daughter is almost 16. She is mature enough to be trusted to go on a two day trip that is chaperoned and monitored.  \nIt isn't a \"coed sleepover\". It's one singular boy and four other girls. If his parents are paying for a private room, you can bet they expect him to behave. Plus, what kind of nonsense can he get up to in a perpetually occupied space?  \nYour daughter will resent you if you don't let her go. She will feel like you're ruining her social life. She's comfortable with it and she wants to go. Let her.", "YTA and there's a simple solution: you go yourself and keep an eye on them.", "YTA what exactly do you think 4 girls and 1 guy are going to do together? There's also a chaperone.", "YTA. I work in care and had a parent insist that her female child only had female caregivers. The only two male caregivers working on that ward were gay - and so were half the female caregivers. None of us were ever going to do anything the patient but it certainly wasn\u2019t going to be the men. You are making a lot of assumptions and denying your child a chance and a bonding experience over something you think COULD happen but realistically probably won\u2019t.", "Honestly sounds more like you just don\u2019t want your kid to go. No way a trip for a private school this far in advance is excluding one of its students. I think you\u2019re worried it\u2019s a cooed trip away from you, in general. You have how many months to save up & prepare? Why are you not even willing to do that? Next school year is a long ways away still, plenty of time to budget it in if you\u2019re so dead set on her not sharing the offered room. Maybe these other kids you feel ill about are her friends & that\u2019s who she wants to share with.

Do you not trust the parents chaperoning?", "My son is friends exclusively with girls and kids who were once girls. I love it when he has sleepovers. They don\u2019t share beds and they change clothes in the bathroom. I don\u2019t see a problem.

If so, instead of complaining about the coed room you should be grateful that this opportunity is even being made available for your child. If you don't like it then pay for a separate room or go and supervise yourself.", "YTA. Poor kid, give her a chance geez. Also stop being so focused on gender it\u2019s not 1950", "YTA, this is a chaperoned event and a chance for your daughter to make friends and build relationships with her new school mates.

Gross.", "Why are chaperoned co-ed sleepovers inappropriate?", "you've got to already know the answer, yta. grow up.", "Having been the 'new kid' in many, many schools this kind of exclusion ramps up any bullying - being new AND the only kid not allowed to go still gets me 40 years later.  \n\nI understand the issue some may feel about co-ed camps, but we had more of a 'nasty girls' problem over SA by the boys.  \n\nPerhaps raise the issue with the school about your daughter sharing a co-ed room, but removing one of the other girls from her all-girl room really identifies your daughter as a problem to that group - inviting even more chance of being bullied.\n\nI did 13 schools over my education so was pretty much ALWAYS the new kid.  Teens are hateful, especially the girls - Y will be the AH if you don't come up with another option.", "YTA, but, so is the school!\n\n1. What on earth do you think will happen if she shares a room with a boy?! There will be multiple others in the room too... \n\nWhat exactly are you concerned about?\nIs it the fact that she could possibly have sex? \nIs there a risk of her being sexually assaulted, impregnated, or something else?\nAre you really that concerned that she's going to get pregnant by simply being in the presence of a male?? What if this kid is gay? What if one of the girls she could share a room with was a lesbian, would that also be out of the question?\n\nLike, seriously (in case you didn't catch the sarcasm in my previous comments) unless you know something you're not telling us, co-ed sharing in a group setting while on a school excursion... I just can't even fathom your logic for not allowing her to share with the group if this is her only option in attending!?\n\nAs for the school, they really need to put more effort into finding a solution. What if there was another couple of students transferring into the school in the next month or so? Seriously, do better! These sorts of trips are the type that can make your highschool experience so much better! They are socially affirming, bonding over shared experiences outside of the classroom, getting the opportunity to meet/interact with others you don't always share space with in a less formal environment. \nShe's already on the back foot due to starting mid year, she's already going to have to navigate making and building on these new friendships. Imagine, everyone else goes and comes back talking about all the things they did/saw/experienced etc... And there's your poor daughter, unable to participate and left feeling more isolated!\n\nMy opinion: get over whatever bullshit is holding you back from allowing her to go. Get onto the school and advocate heavily for your daughter to attend as part of the larger school group. And if all that fails, allow her to go with the smaller group.", "YTA.

It's a private school, and part of their traditions is a beginning of the year overnight class trip every August. She was too late for this year, but next years' is a 2 night trip to Philadelphia. \n\nOne problem: no more than 6 people can share a hotel room, and there are now 37 girls that would need one. We found out that there's a group of 4 'day-only' kids (3 girls, 1 boy) that actually do stay overnight, at the same hotel even, they just don't do it through the school.\n\nThe four aren't super well liked and there have been bullying issues, especially against the boy, but they're friends with each other, so the parents banded together and decided to just fund and chaperone them themselves to avoid any issues. They do two rooms: one for the kids, and one for whichever parent goes. \n\nThey've reached out and offered to let my daughter share with them. She wants to do it. I'm not comfortable. Coed sleepovers are not acceptable. It's completely inappropriate. \n\nWe've been back and forth with this for weeks. The verdict is clear. There's no open room she can get into through the school, they're not getting her a single room, we can't afford to do anything similar to the other independent group, and we just can't accept a coed sleepover. Going is not an option. \n\nShe's devastated and begging me to reconsider. She says it's my fault that she even had to transfer schools sophmore year and that we've had to move so much that this is the first time we're going to be somewhere for multiple years. I think we need to pass, but now my husband is starting to waffle and say that maybe we should consider making an exception because everything has been hard on her and this is a major school tradition (and opportunity for her to make friends).\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So is \"substantially interfering with educational opportunities, benefits, or programs of 1 or more pupils\" (this particular line is straight from a state law in Michigan).  Putting a chasm between the popular and the already-bullied children is just more bullying, done by and promoted by the administration and they must know this.  If this \"major school tradition\" has always been exclusionary, then it's a bad tradition and needs to be amended to be inclusionary.

I understand the idea of \"no coed sleepovers\" when you're talking one boy/one girl, in terms of things that boys and girls can get up to that come with risks that don't happen with single-sex sleepovers... but for something to happen here, either all five of them would have to be down for it or it would have to happen when only two people are in the room (which is a situation that could just as easily happen if there were four girls in one hotel room and four boys in another room and six of them go sneak out while two go fool around in the abandoned room, no cooed sleeping arrangements necessary).", "I remember being a 16 year old girl and going on school trips.

Trying to wrap her in bubblewrap will just make her act out against you - it's that sort of thing that will drive her TO go try and mess with guys.\n\nTrust her for once in her life.", "At a private school where most of the parents share outdated conservative views with this OP? Yeah i figure that the boy is definitely \"that boy,\" and none of the other guys want to room with him, or will make a show out of harassing him.

Why is YOUR daughter the one who can\u2019t get in a room?", "The school deserves a YTA - they shouldn't be leaving one kid out because they \"can't afford\" one more room. The price of this event is one kid out of 73 being left out?  It shouldn't be a single, either - just make some rooms less than 6. (Like girl rooms are 6 - 6 - 5 - 5 - 5 - 5 - 5, rather than six 6s and a single.) If they need to fundraise for it or ask a little extra of everyone, the cost of one extra room spread among 73 students is not that much. There is some ridiculous I don't even know what - cliquish? elitist? something - going on. I would talk to the school about it - no kid should be left out like that. (Also wondering about these other students having to get their own room - what is up with this school?)\n\nBut second, also a soft YTA for you too. Having her miss the trip when a viable option is being kindly offered, even without the school doing their part to figure it out, is wrong. She's in high school. It's a terrible time to change schools. (I had to change for junior year. I vividly remember the pain.) Being the only kid not on a trip like this will really hurt - not just in the moment, but for the long haul; they'll all be talking about this and that memory made and she'll be on the outside of it and not \"really part of the class.\" She's already starting behind them in terms of forming memories, friendships, community. Let her go with the other kids. It's not an orgy. And she's not the only girl in the room. (Also, the assumption that single-sex rooms will prevent any sexual liaisons whatsoever excludes the fact that gay teens do exist. So, does co-ed become mandatory for them? But then there are bi kids. It's a slippery slope. A big part of it comes down to numbers, supervision, and trust.)", "So why can't they get 7 rooms?

It's an arbitrary boundary. \n\nThese kids are 16. If they desperately want to hook up that badly, they're going to find a time and place to do it. OP does not follow their daughter around 24/7. And I can think of dozens of better opportunities than a bed in a hotel room shared with several other people they don't know that well. \n\nAnd you yourself said boys would be sneaked into girls' rooms and presumably vice versa, so insisting on a girls or boys only room isn't a perfect solution. At a certain point you just have to trust your kid to be sensible and not treat them like a maiden from medieval times.", "I\u2019m sorry, using this logic she should never be allowed out of a locked closet because anywhere she goes someone could sneak in and have sex with her in front of everyone else as long as there was a duvet pregnant (the true cause of teen pregnancy!)\n\nSome parental boundaries ARE illogical. At 15-16, you should be less concerned with keeping your kid a virgin and more concerned that they understand the consequences that come with sex and how to mitigate them.\n\n I also grew up in the 90s. While your dad was setting strict boundaries that would have made zero difference because boys were sneaking into the girls\u2019 rooms anyways, my mom was talking to me honestly about sex, but the dangers and the perks. She was leaving condoms around the house and making sure my birth control was refilled. Instead of suggesting that virginity was a virtue and that my value was tied to it, she stressed the importance of choice and making sure I only did something if *I* wanted to. And guess what? I found the clumsy and insincere passes of boys in high school underwhelming and have to confidence to reject it because doing it didn\u2019t seem like a rebellion. It wasn\u2019t forbidden fruit.\n\nParental boundaries shouldn\u2019t be a \u201cabsolutely not, no discussion\u201d sort of thing. As your own story shows, that didn\u2019t work for you. It\u2019s anecdotal, but the kids I knew with strict parents were the ones who always did the most risky things to get around the rules. Those of us with parents who knew teenagers would be teenagers and instead armed us with accurate knowledge, a sense that they trusted us, and the idea that we got to make our own decisions about our actions were usually a lot more mellow and didn\u2019t feel the need to be edgy or push boundaries.", "And kids can visit others rooms in a hotel.

That said, this is a situation of your own creation and you need to do something to help your daughter fit in.\n\n1 - Contact the school to find out why they are doing 6 kids/room instead of one more room and switching it up so its 5 kids per room.
