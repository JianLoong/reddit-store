She did use something that she probably shouldn\u2019t have and now is hiding the evidence. I\u2019d tread with caution if you let her watch your kid.", "What\u2019s sad is that she won\u2019t even tell you\u2026 what if your son has an allergy to an ingredient in the cream\u2026 by telling you, you can prevent further exposure..,", "> If there's no photo of the cream that she used, then nobody can ever confirm that she used the wrong cream and she's free to continue to say she did something safe and can't be blamed.\n\nOk, but what is she trying to avoid? Is she afraid the kid will have serious complications and she's going to jail for it, and will risk making the complications more serious to avoid jail? Because I don't think she'll be trusted with the kid again, and it's growing less likely the shiftier she becomes.", "I heartily endorse this comment.", "Is MIL involved in MLMs by any chance? So many of those products are low quality and over/incorrectly used, causing rashes, burns, hair loss, etc. \"Essential oils\" are a common culprit.", "> Especially when they are your only support network\n\nIf this is true, unfortunately this situation shows you have no support network. She can never be trusted again", "Please tell us that MIL is going to be cut off. She is not a support network, she is harming you and your baby. The most important thing is keeping your baby safe which means keep baby away from her. Nothing else matters.", "I know it's hard if your ILs are your main/only suppprt system and they are awful. But endangering your child by leaving it with someone that uses medical creams that are supposed to be for adults on a small child and wuth that being a grave danger to your baby and then even having the audacity to refuse to show a picture and even taking the evidence with her, so the doctor doesn't know exactly what has been given, isn't worth the \"support\". It obviously causes more harm than good if you leave your child with your MIL because she cares more about not being at fault than her grandchilds health and safety.", "Maybe also post this to the  r/JNMIL sub. I know you'll get lots of strategies to help you deal with this woman", "MIL is not competent enough to be a support person. At all, never leave your children in her care again.", "agreed! - a ER physician", "I would also get the police involved.", "Your name is accurate", "By spot on do you mean you now know that what that commenter said is correct?", "Until she sends you the photo cut her off from the child. She's not a safe watcher.", "Nta but never let her unsupervised visits with your child", "I bet it's some MLM garbage", "I remember an non verbal autistic patient we had at the surgical ward I worked at as a volunteer after school.\nHe got really badly burnt hands and of course was treated for it but since he never said anything and didn't even flinch in pain it took I believe two days until someone noticed he wasn't getting any pain medication - with 2nd degree burns all over his hands being regularly bandaged...\nWith people that can't speak for themselves you *always* need to double check, especially if they are as vulnerable as a small child!", "What ridiculous logic is this? \n\nI eat foods and use creams/rubs from my culture and upbringing that would send my sibling into anaphylaxis. Every person is different.", "She\u2019ll tell you that much but not what it is? I would threaten her with the police. \n\nWhat does the doctor say?\n\nNTA", "Wouldn\u2019t surprise me if she used essential oils? OP, is she into oils and stuff?", "That's what I was thinking, too. And potentially food not age appropriate", "  I saw a twin whose nanny applied vick's vapor rub to a baby under 1 year old. The baby went from normal to basically brain dead. That baby will never be able to talk, run, play with her twin or be an independent adult.", "I was thinking MLM essential oils.", "That has to be the saddest Reddit story I have ever read.", "Even if it wasn't really actively trying to kill you it definitely is absolutely irresponsible to youse any form of medication for people that it is not for. Especially people that can't refuse or tell if something is wrong like babies and small children.", "I was thinking about that Florida grandmother who.... two of her grandchildren through \"mistakes\".\n\nShe was just arraigned...", "Anyone not wanting their heart broken. Do not seek clarification", "Please tell me it was the grandma who got ostracized", "Yeah, no, that story is a load of soul-shattering heartbreak.", "Yup. Reminded of the awful coconut oil story on here.\n\nDeliberately not linking to it.

It\u2019s been over 2 years since I read that story last. Breaks my heart.", "ope, yeah - sorry if the pronouns weren't clear.", "Yes, very much so.", "because after the CPS-equivalent investigation it was determined it was an accident. a stupid, neglectful, avoidable accident but an accident nonetheless.", "At 2 my mum found out I had an orange allergy (brings up eczema), to this day I stay away from orange and have to limit exposure to other citrus fruits (I can tolerate up to about 2l of lemonade as an example)", "[removed]", "Yep this.\n\nShe could have killed baby.
