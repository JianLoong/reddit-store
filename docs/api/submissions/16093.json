We all want to trust our families\u2026..", "notice how she never replied on how the MIL predicted that the doctor was going to ask for the medicine or that the brother was going to go through her things looking for it ? \n\n\nthat\u2019s bc she\u2019s got no good explanation\n\n\nif she says \u201cya she knew that the doctor was gonna ask to see the medicine and knew that the brother was gonna look for it so she hid it bc she\u2019s an evil plotting mastermind\u201d then she sounds ridiculous\n\n\nbut if she says \u201cshe didn\u2019t know they were gonna ask to see the medicine or look for it but just took it with her\u201d then it\u2019s obvious that it wasn\u2019t on purpose so the MIL didn\u2019t sound as bad and she hates her so she wants her to sound bad\n\n\nthink", "did you not read this paragraph in the comment ?: \n\n\n\u201cshe probably said something more like - \u201cit\u2019s my cream, i keep it in my purse but i\u2019m at work i don\u2019t have time to look for the exact type of adult cortisone cream it was, it\u2019s a cortisone cream and my son turned out fine, leave me alone \u201c\n\n\noh you did read it, you\u2019re just asking that question as if you didn\u2019t already see the answer to your question becauseeee\u2026.? \n\n\nwhy \u2026why are you pretending you didn\u2019t again ?", "hello\n\n\nincorrect\n\n\nOP has no evidence she \u201chid\u201d the creams, just that they weren\u2019t there and she was at work - like i already said, what\u2019s more likely that a grandmother wants to poison and kill here grandson/make him sick or that she simply keeps the ADULT cream in her own purse and therefore it was at work ? \n\n\nthink\n\n\nyou literally just got proven wrong and shown where you were wrong and rather than admit it you\u2019re trying to make things up, incredible how egotistical people are over obviously exaggerated internet stories", "I apologize for not close-reading every single comment you made in this thread. I\u2019m a little bit tired and didn\u2019t think to take detailed notes. I\u2019ll do better next time.\n\nIt seems unlikely to me that grandma would be unable to take a single minute out of her day to help her grandchild, but I suppose she works in some sort of high security facility where her purse is locked away until the end of her shift. I also suppose that she has a mild but mostly benign memory issue that prevents her from recalling the name of this product that she uses frequently enough to need to carry it with her at all times.\n\nHopefully OP updates her post when grandma gets out of work and immediately reports back about what products she may have used! And then we\u2019ll know that this was all just one big silly misunderstanding. Thank goodness you were here to explain!", "You have not read anything again. Nowhere does it say or was it implied the grandmother thought the cream she put on her grandson was going to kill him. She stupidly thought it was fine to put adult steroid cream on a baby.

My story is not unique.", "lmao\n\n\nlook at you desperately trying to save face bc i called you out on your incredibly obvious pretending that you hadn\u2019t read that comment\n\n\nhow do you know i had a bunch of comments in this thread unless you DID see them or checked my profile to see ? \n\n\nlmao you\u2019re not clever at all with your pretending and attempt at sarcasm making points that don\u2019t hold water\n\n\nyou\u2019re no different than OP never answering the simple question - how did grandma know ahead of time that the doctor would ask to see the medicine and the brother would go through her things to look for it ? bc she knows there\u2019s no right answer there that doesn\u2019t expose her for being a liar\n\n\ncheers", "so you can\u2019t read again ? \n\n\n\u201cpoison or kill here grandson/make him sick\u201d \n\n\ndo you know what a slash is ? \n\n\nas in \u201cEITHER\u201d kill OR make sick? \n\n\nagain yes you do. again you\u2019re just pretending to not understand and try to misquote me intentionally to try to make your argument sound better\n\n\nyou\u2019re not clever even a tiny bit, you\u2019re just wrong and it\u2019s very obvious when you lie like that that you know it\n\n\nkinda explains your situation if you lie and try to manipulate that much, that\u2019s classic narcissist\n\n\nwe\u2019re done here", "Yup, you got me. I\u2019m a big lying liar. Well done.", "Lol. Oh come on now. Make him sick is still under the category of hurting the baby. I did not misquote you. You said both. It\u2019s obvious I was saying there is no mal intent on the part of the grandmother. Your argument that this story must be false because the grandmother did this on purpose is not mentioned or implied anywhere in the post. You pulled that out of thin air. Calling me a narcissist is not going to trigger me. Lol."]}
