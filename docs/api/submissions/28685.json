I honestly think she\u2019s the one and have recently often thought about popping the question. However, a recent family gathering has made tensions high between our families. \n\nWhile attending my (26 M) brother\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s birthday party at their house, my mother and my brother brought me to the kitchen and confronted me, and told me that my girlfriend needs to dress more modestly and that they have a problem with her not wearing a bra. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because she\u2019s my long time girlfriend, but even though she weighs around 160 pounds, her not wearing a bra has never stuck out to me before and I hadn\u2019t even really noticed until they had pointed it out to me. My mother told me her breasts are too big for her not to wear a bra and that even her boyfriend has commented on it before, saying that when she\u2019s in the room and because she\u2019s not wearing a bra, that\u2019s the only thing you can look at. \n\nMy brother then confessed to me that his girlfriend (26 F) also has had a problem with my girlfriend not wearing a bra, and that it has caused multiple fights between the two of them because she\u2019s afraid my brothers eyes will wander and she secretly is afraid he likes overweight girls. I never thought of my girlfriend as overweight, and thought for her height she looked about average build for her weight. \n\nAfter hearing them say this, I couldn\u2019t help but feel angry on her behalf. My girlfriend has mentioned to me offhandedly before that she doesn\u2019t like wearing bras because they make her chest feel very tight and uncomfortable. I simply told my mom and brother, \u201cOkay.\u201d \n\nI then went out to the party from the kitchen where we\u2019d been talking and got my girlfriend and left. A few minutes after I got home my brother called me, asking me why I had left and I let him know exactly how I\u2019d felt about their little talk with me. That I didn\u2019t think my girlfriend\u2019s body shape or the way she dresses is anyone\u2019s business and that if people wanted to be creepy and stare at her, that wasn\u2019t her fault.\n\nMy mom then got on the phone and told me that my girlfriend needs to have respect for other people and self respect when she dresses herself. Mind you, my girlfriend had been wearing a t shirt and jeans to this birthday party. That her weight and body makes people uncomfortable and she should dress to accommodate that. \n\nI then told them how important I think it is for my girlfriend to be comfortable in the clothes she\u2019s wearing and if she can\u2019t be comfortable around my family then we don\u2019t need to see them anymore. My brother and my mom started to scream at me over the phone, which evolved into a screaming match between the three of us. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong, but I wanted a second opinion in case I\u2019m being dramatic or brash. So, AITA for blowing up on my mom and brother after they said they don\u2019t like the way my girlfriend dresses?", "created_utc": 1697005305, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1757bse/aita_for_blowing_up_on_my_mom_and_brother_after/", "score": 4057, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Imagine the same scenario where they wanted her to cover her head or tie up her hair for the \"fear\" of making people uncomfortable or \"attracting\" lustful gazes.\n\nIts not like she was wearing a bikini to a wedding.

Absolutely not ! \n\nIf they are this insecure, that means they don\u2019t have faith and trust in their partner. So they have to work on those insecurities on their own. Your girlfriend shouldn\u2019t be subjected to such blatant body shaming and fatphobia.

If someone is beautiful, we all notice. Nothing wrong with that. But staring at a family member with sexual undertone is so inappropriate (it sounds like you two are in a serious relationship and I would consider her a part of the family).

If she hasn't tried it yet, I would highly recommend a professional bra fitting. \nNot because she needs to be wearing one for anybody else but because a correctly fitted one (especially one without underwire), might actually be more comfortable for her than not wearing one, especially when moving around a lot.\n\nI got a fitting done because I had the same issue as her and it was a night and day difference!\n\nAlso sizing options in brick and mortar stores tend to be terrible, but once she has the correct size, there are tons of options online (and not only from the expensive brands!)", "If you didn't notice, then it probably wasn't noticeable. And her weight is none of their beeswax.\n\nI hate bras, too. Mine are perky and hold their shape just fine, however they're pretty alert to temperature changes, so if I'm wearing a monochrome or light-coloured tee the slightest whiff of wind or cool temp makes my nips show and come on, it _can_ be distracting once you notice them poking out of a sea of whatever colour I'm wearing.\n\nAt work I wear a bra, obviously. At home I don't bother. In informal situations I wear a very useful pair of small silicone nipple covers. They stay put for hours and I don't have to worry about people being able to tell if there's a draft by staring at my tee.

I honestly think she\u2019s the one and have recently often thought about popping the question. However, a recent family gathering has made tensions high between our families. \n\nWhile attending my (26 M) brother\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s birthday party at their house, my mother and my brother brought me to the kitchen and confronted me, and told me that my girlfriend needs to dress more modestly and that they have a problem with her not wearing a bra. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because she\u2019s my long time girlfriend, but even though she weighs around 160 pounds, her not wearing a bra has never stuck out to me before and I hadn\u2019t even really noticed until they had pointed it out to me. My mother told me her breasts are too big for her not to wear a bra and that even her boyfriend has commented on it before, saying that when she\u2019s in the room and because she\u2019s not wearing a bra, that\u2019s the only thing you can look at. \n\nMy brother then confessed to me that his girlfriend (26 F) also has had a problem with my girlfriend not wearing a bra, and that it has caused multiple fights between the two of them because she\u2019s afraid my brothers eyes will wander and she secretly is afraid he likes overweight girls. I never thought of my girlfriend as overweight, and thought for her height she looked about average build for her weight. \n\nAfter hearing them say this, I couldn\u2019t help but feel angry on her behalf. My girlfriend has mentioned to me offhandedly before that she doesn\u2019t like wearing bras because they make her chest feel very tight and uncomfortable. I simply told my mom and brother, \u201cOkay.\u201d \n\nI then went out to the party from the kitchen where we\u2019d been talking and got my girlfriend and left. A few minutes after I got home my brother called me, asking me why I had left and I let him know exactly how I\u2019d felt about their little talk with me. That I didn\u2019t think my girlfriend\u2019s body shape or the way she dresses is anyone\u2019s business and that if people wanted to be creepy and stare at her, that wasn\u2019t her fault.\n\nMy mom then got on the phone and told me that my girlfriend needs to have respect for other people and self respect when she dresses herself. Mind you, my girlfriend had been wearing a t shirt and jeans to this birthday party. That her weight and body makes people uncomfortable and she should dress to accommodate that. \n\nI then told them how important I think it is for my girlfriend to be comfortable in the clothes she\u2019s wearing and if she can\u2019t be comfortable around my family then we don\u2019t need to see them anymore. My brother and my mom started to scream at me over the phone, which evolved into a screaming match between the three of us. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong, but I wanted a second opinion in case I\u2019m being dramatic or brash. So, AITA for blowing up on my mom and brother after they said they don\u2019t like the way my girlfriend dresses?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The situation should have been addressed by your brother and mother later, you can't blame them for that.", "They are right she should wear a bra when she goes out. Unless she is wearing multiple layers it\u2019s obvious when a lady isn\u2019t wearing a bra.", "[deleted]", "Nta tbh but to notice someone isn't wearing a bra don't u gotta stare and look hard also 160 is pretty skinny atleast from what I can tell bc most women are 200'+ now \nBut I also recommend she go to a tailor to get fitted for a custom bra just bc I wouldn't be comfortable with let's say strangers or people at work staring at her nips", "Wow this was long \ud83d\ude2a", "NTA for standing up for your gf in terms of her weight & body type but I don\u2019t think mentioning to you that they wish she would wear a bra is really out of line. The way they went about it was fully out of line though, they could\u2019ve left the body shaming out of it and just asked you to ask your gf to wear a bra at family functions.

I\u2019m 150 and 5\u20197, I would literally never dream of leaving the house without a bra on.  While your brother and mother do not have a right to criticize your GF on her outfit or appearance, I would argue that basic decency comes in to play here and would give them the benefit of the doubt.  Unless she is very tall it is most likely extremely noticeable.  This doesn\u2019t really have to do with her weight or appearance.  If a 100 pound woman was wearing a T-shirt and no bra it could still be in appropriate if it was noticeable enough.  It also comes off as very sloppy and lazy which could lead to preconceived notions about her personality. \n\nProper undergarments are the bare minimum for almost any job, this rule is there because the vast majority of people feel uncomfortable when it is noticed.  If a male was wearing shorts and his testicals were hanging out it would make people uncomfortable, same rules apply here.  Sports bras are very comfortable and still hold things in place.  Does she dress this way specifically for attention?", "You never really noticed that your large-breasted girlfriend doesn't wear a bra?  Really?", "YTA . There is a time and a place to dress a certain way. If it was around friends then I think it's fine but for family gathering, come on that's a bit too much. Everyone here jumping on the jealousy train because  your girlfriend is sooooo hot that the women in your family just can't fathom it. It's attention seeking. Women know this. You don't go to a family beach day wearing a thong, you dress appropriately. It's not because your grandma and aunties are going to be jealous  while your dad and uncle stare. It's because your respect your family that's you at least want to be decent.  \nBesides if a man walked in with some grey sweat pants slinging dick left and right in a family gathering it would be an issue.
