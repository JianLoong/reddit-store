But now that you know his travel habits aren\u2019t compatible with yours, for future trips, each of you should make your own arrangements. I frequently travel with a family member who lives very close to me. But their habit is to get to the airport with minimal time to spare, because they hate waiting at the gate. While I want to make sure m there in plenty of time and don\u2019t mind waiting to board. So when we go on a trip, we each make our own arrival arrangements. While they\u2019ve never missed a flight, it\u2019s much less stressful for me to get there earlier.", "Info: how long before takeoff did you get through security?", "YTA. \n\nYou didn't miss the flight. Nothing bad happened. You are too worried about what \"could have\" happened. I hope you paid your fair share of this trip. If your dad paid and you spoke to him like that he should change your return flight to the second you land in Germany. And refuse to travel with you again. \n\nHis actions did nothing to you beyond your own self-imposed stress.", "YTA, you over worry that's on you and you have to deal with it. But everyone doesn't have to chase their entire personality or schedule to suit you.\nSo on top of being a worrier add selfish.", "YTA.I travel like you travel. I'm a bucket of stress and anxiety, full of concerns about what could happen. Traveling with people like your dad drives me mad.\n\nBut although I'm like this when I travel, it doesn't give me a pass to mistreat those who don't travel the way I do. Sure, what your dad did would have upset me, but honestly, that's on me. Next time the two o you can try to find some better approaches to help travel easier for both of you, but you acted  like a child, pouting, glaring, giving the silent treatment, and then finally yelling at him in public and saying truly mean things. Were you stressed and anxious? Absolutely. I really get this. Are these reasons for your behavior? Absolutely. Do they *excuse* your behavior? Not at all.  None of these were good reactions, and all they did was make things miserable for everyone.", "YTA  \nYou weren't late, despite all of the things that you imagined could have happened. You're going to Germany on a fantastic trip, and start it with a poor experience.   \nNot everyone is going to be able or willing to change to match your expectations. I would suggest learning that sooner than later, and finding ways to communicate in healthier ways and offering help beforehand to lower your own stress.", "INFO:  Did you miss or very nearly miss your flight?", "ESH. The silent treatment isn't really a healthy coping mechanism, and you blowing up at your dad is one reason why. You guys need to learn to compromise if you're going to travel together. Maybe help him pack the night before to encourage him. Learn how to communicate a little more effectively.", "YTA\n\nI am one of those people who has to have EVERYTHING prepared well in advance. If I can, I'll pack my suitcase a week before, have every single thing filed, organised etc. But I also understand, that not everyone is like this, and any stress I get from others not behaving like I do, it's on me. \n\nYou were not late, nothing actually happened to you. Yet you took your self inflicted stress out on your dad, just because his method and preparation for travelling is different from yours. \n\nWhat you said to you'd dad was really cruel. And I think you could reflect on your own behaviour and say your own words to yourself. I mean, you stressing out when nothing was happening and glaring at your dad and giving him silent treatment, because he stopped at target and bought a coffee and wasn't operating in a manner you find correct, that effects him a lot. You REALLY hurt him with your words, because you were stressed out. \n\nIf I was your dad I wouldn't travel with you again, you're too stressed out and take it out on other people in a very mean way.", "YTA. I bet that\u2019s the kind of criticism you\u2019ve heard from your mom or whatever partner. You\u2019re just parroting something that he\u2019s probably already sensitive about. You need to relax and apologize.", "YTA... Learn to handle your emotions like an adult.. if he wants to be slow then just leave him behind..", "No but we very well could have if for example there had been more traffic or longer lines", "YTA.\n\nYou're pissed about what COULD have happened, not what DID happen.  You want to get to the airport 3 hours early?  Ridiculous even at a place like LAX.  Now, if dad is one of those \"Get to the gate just in time for the final boarding call\" types?  OK, you'd have a point, but it doesn't sound like that's the situation.  You're just pissed because he isn't as high strung as you are.", "You didn't though...did you?\nYou're 18 yrs old...relax & enjoy your trip...have a nice time visiting your family in Germany! Is this your 1st time in Europe? I was 17 the 1st time I went to Italy to visit my family for the summer...I traveled with a cousin from Canada...it was the 1st time I flew and the 1st time I went went anywhere without my parents for an extended period of time...if I told you what happened on the way home...lol...and I still made it home\ud83d\ude09. \nI hope you and your father work things out & can enjoy your trip together.", "But there wasn't. \n\nIf you don't like how your dad does things, you are now old enough to do things separately from him. \n\nIf you choose to do things together with him then you both have to compromise from your extremes and discuss that rationally. \n\nYou didn't have to wait for him to get coffee, for example. You can just make your way to the gate. You could have ordered the uber yourself. \n\nBut flipping out and yelling isn't cool. *Especially* when it did in fact work out fine.", "My airport even tells you to be there 4 hours in advanced.", "Perhaps.  I don't pretend to know every airport.  But OP would (most likely) be flying through LAX and I *do* know that airport.  Outside of \"bizarre\" times (Holidays, immediate days after 9/11, etc.), it doesn't take 3 hours to get through that airport.", "But isn't the rule in America that you have to be 3 hrs in advanced for intercontinental flights? Cause I know that is the rule for Europe to for example USA.", "Granted, I've not done it too many times (although ironically enough, I will be in about 2 weeks)... but I don't recall anything like that.", "It's not really a rule.", "Well maybe that is why OP was so stressed. Cause she knew the rule and dad was chilling. \n\n\n(And safe journeys!)", "Here it is. Unwrittem but a rule non the less. They always say 3 hrs for intercontinental flights and 2 for flights within Europe", "It's still more of a recommendation to ensure everything (check-in, security checks, passport control if necessary, etc.) gets completed in time and without causing anyone undue stress than an actual rule.\n\nObviously on top of that you also need to allow for additional time in case of traffic or some other delay on your way to the airport - the longer your way the more additional time you should plan for."]}
