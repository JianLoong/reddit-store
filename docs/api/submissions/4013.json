Now she is pregnant and asked me if I can scoop the litter until she give birth because of toxoplasmosis but I looked it up and as long as she wears gloves and washes her hands she should be good. So I told her absolutely not. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t happy but i reminded her of our agreement when we got the cat. I told her it was her responsibility and if she didn\u2019t want to take care of it anymore with the new baby coming we can get rid of it and find it a new home. She said no and has been scooping the litter. Her sister was over and saw her doing this and flipped out at me telling how dangerous it is. But of course her sister is going to be on her side and overreact.
